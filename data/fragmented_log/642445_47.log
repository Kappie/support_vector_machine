 has just 1 ncluster mismatch, the same eta bit errors 
observed last night and at least 1 phi error.

<pre>The Run Control SoundServer is now running.  You may hear  
warning and error messages from the speakers near  
the b0dap58 and b0dap59 machines. 
 
Only machines in the control room will produce  
audio messages, for obvious reasons.</pre>
