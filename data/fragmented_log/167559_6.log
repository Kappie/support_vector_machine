ll be with cal triggers on noisy towers. 
Steve and I compared the noisy ones to the masked channels 
in traceDirac.  It looks like there are a few in the plug and 
perhaps elsewhere that might be nice to mask, as they keep triggering much more than others.  We've all decided that 2GeV 
is too low for the sum Et threshold, but also things might be helped if we got rid of only a few noisy channels throughout the 
whole detector.  This is something Rick or I could look into later when we see the rates when we
