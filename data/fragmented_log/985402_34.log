: 100  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00391496 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 100 components = 0.00391496 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.002109 max=0.003087 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000073 rms=0.000430 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.808243 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.6 minute time intervals
! Adding 19 model components to the UV plane model.
