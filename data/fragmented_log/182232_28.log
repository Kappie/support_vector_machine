 Run 121572 again several BTO from CMX_01.  end and manually reboot TSI00.  -> From our L3 info: BTO are from EVB (HRR or cleanup fixes), SM (need to reboot eb10), TS(reboot tsi00), or downstream of L3/CSL.  So far this shift we've tried HRR and cleaning up EVB/L3.  Check of SM/EVB/L3 doesn't show anything hung on eb10.  Now trying reboot of TSI00......
