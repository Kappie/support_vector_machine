5 for 6% of the events.  
 
 tdc 561588: Get many unpaired edges on channels 0 and 1 (and  
             maybe on channel 2 as well; this bears further 
             investigating). 
 
 tdc 561589: Split pulse problem on channel 61 for 1% of the  
             events. 
 
 tdc 561590: No output on channel 47. Also see an unpaired 
             edge and a second hit of correct pulse width 
             for a single event on channel 1. The start times 
             for these pulses do not seem to be correlated
