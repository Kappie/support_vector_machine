ponent: 050  -  total flux cleaned = -0.00136664 Jy
! Component: 100  -  total flux cleaned = -0.00170549 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 100 components = -0.00170549 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.004797 max=0.006132 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000255 rms=0.001501 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.889003 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.6 minute time intervals
! Adding 15 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 116 components and 0.889003 J
