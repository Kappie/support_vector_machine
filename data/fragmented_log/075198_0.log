1) the remark on new hot ladders in L00 Z is in fact not a new pb. This is going on since at least 2 weeks and was indicated to the Si expert in the first part of my CO shift on Aug 10, The expert considered this was still OK if things were not worsening. <br>
2) The hot channel on CEM advertised (he sent an email to the person in charge) by the previous CO is persistent. W'll keep an eye on it.<br>
For both remarks see the plots attached here below in the shift e-log.</tt>
