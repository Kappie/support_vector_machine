Steve K came in earlier today when I was fighting with the L2de crate.  With the help of Stephen Miller we tracked down the bad boss/boss always being held high to the termination board on the left hand side of the crate.  We don't understand it, but simply reseating the board made all signals in the crate wonderful again.  I'm going to push on with cluster merging now
