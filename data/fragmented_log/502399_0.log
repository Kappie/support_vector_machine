Finish the SVT timing test successfully.<br> 
Results will be described on SVT e-log. <br> 
In short, after each Track Fitter, it takes 4us to combine  
all wedge data and it takes 1us to bust Ghost. <br> 
 
I recover everything same as before. Now, SVT is ready to 
take any data with same configration as before.
