Dear God, I even get paged when the entire detector is down... 
 
they tried taking a Rick run tonight.  Our old friend b0l2cl04 wouldn't pass coldstart.  It turns out the real reason was that the ace didn't know the dcas in slot 9 was unplugged, so he didn't know to remove it from the run configuration, and the error messages from RC didn't give any indication of this fact.  I came in and replaced that board (SN40)
