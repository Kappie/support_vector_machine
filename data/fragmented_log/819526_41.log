nt: 150  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00090856 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00104348 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.00104348 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.005774 max=0.006343 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000578 rms=0.001749 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 1.98009 Jy
