<pre>PEM/PHA/PSH buttons cyan (message out of range) on HV Global Alarms.  PEM heartbeat purple.  Called Mike Lindgren who directed  me to Luciana Malfarreli. 
 
I made two phone calls to Italy. 
 
Luciana told me that she stopped (remotely) the iFix updating on the Plug HV PC upstairs because she suspected work was being done on the Plug.  She restarted the updating and after a while iFix came back. 
 
Luciana is investigating occasional crashes in the HV monitoring
