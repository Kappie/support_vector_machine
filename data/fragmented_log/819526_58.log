! Adding 12 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 12 components and 1.7022 Jy
! Inverting map and beam 
! Your choice of large map pixels excluded 0.697% of the data.
!  The x-axis pixel size should ideally be below 0.1907 milli-arcsec
! Estimated beam: bmin=0.8524 mas, bmaj=2.375 mas, bpa=-8.167 degrees
! Estimated noise=509.631 mJy/beam.
