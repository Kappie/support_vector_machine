<p>Spoke with the Cryo-Techs about this.  The flow in the SUVA tank causes Pump 7 to temporarily turn off which causes the differential pressure to drop.  When the pump turns back on the pressure comes back up.  It went throught this iteration about 5-6 times, but they assure me it is (reasonably) normal operation.  Things have been stable again for the last few minutes.
