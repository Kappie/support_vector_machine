The plots of pedestals, noise, and dnoise can be found at 
http://www-cdf.lbl.gov/~igv/Plots_run_110920/ 
Pedestals and noise are determined without bad bunch crossing suppression 
but using robust statistics (pulse height distribution median is plotted 
as pedestal, half of the range between 84th and 16th percentiles as noise). 
Overall, there seems to be large common mode noise both in L00 and ISL 
while SVX seems to be OK. I'll suppress bad bunch crossings and make 
more representative plo
