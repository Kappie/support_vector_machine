onent: 050  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00129101 Jy
! Component: 100  -  total flux cleaned = 0.0011978 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 100 components = 0.0011978 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.002901 max=0.003065 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000005 rms=0.000702 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.447563 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.6 minute time intervals
! Adding 12 model components to the UV plane model.
