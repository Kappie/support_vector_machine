   Then after booking  
the detector and taking a cosmics run we decided to   
pursue what appeared to be stuck bits in eta and phi.   
These were not in the Isolation system,  but in the   
part of the L2 clustering system that sends signals  
to Isolation.  Monica Tecchio fixed these, and then  
the sequence that she detailed above happened.   
Tomorrow we plan to continue with the tests in the morning  
until Stephen arrives. </pre>
