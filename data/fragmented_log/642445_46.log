 SN01, I reflowed Q15. Taking cosmic runs 
129231, 129232 
Both Clist and Isolist had good agreement on the number  
of clusters. (although for both there was at least one 
event with an error.) 
For Clist the ntower entry had a lot of errors, but no 
eta or phi errors. 
For Isolist, there were still eta errors, but no phi errors. 
 
I then reflowed B21-B25 and E8-E16 on CLique SN03. For this 
board in run 129233, Clist has lots of ncluster and ntower 
mismatches with just a few eta and phi errors. 
Isolist
