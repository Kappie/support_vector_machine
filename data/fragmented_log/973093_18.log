! Component: 150  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00160389 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00164298 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.00164298 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.004884 max=0.003852 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000209 rms=0.001410 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.142389 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.5 minute time intervals
! Adding 13 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 65 components and 0.14238
