! Inverting map and beam 
! Your choice of large map pixels excluded 0.973% of the data.
!  The x-axis pixel size should ideally be below 0.1656 milli-arcsec
! Estimated beam: bmin=0.7651 mas, bmaj=0.975 mas, bpa=-12.08 degrees
! Estimated noise=236.69 mJy/beam.
! restore: Substituting estimate of restoring beam from last 'invert'.
! Restoring with beam: 0.7651 x 0.975 at -12.08 degrees (North through East)
