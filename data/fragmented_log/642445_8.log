left plot I was triggering on both BRD_HS_SEED4 and BRD_SEL10, a condition which would give the cluster merging that we've seen.  I've triggered on HS_SEED4 going high at 1 V, and BRD_SEL10 going high at 1V, 560 mV, 360 mV, and 280 mV.  The only one of these four which triggered was at 280 mV, which the above picture is taken from.  The right plot is a picture of all 4 traces, under normal running.  Nothing seems out of order.  For these runs I couldn't use L2DE crate - so I couldn't check TrigMon to make s
