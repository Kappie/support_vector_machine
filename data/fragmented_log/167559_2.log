ode for today's shots.  We called Stephen  
and he and Pasha are working on fixing the data stream so that it 
(hopefully) doesn't split the stream and we accept everything into one place until things are more stable.  Work is in progress.  However, this may indicate that at least the L1 early 
mode is functioning, given that bucket 1 was kept and bucket 0 
filtered (ie- the events were mainly in bucket 1).
