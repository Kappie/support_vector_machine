els are removed by comparing to the cell mean.
 
 3. In faint areas (zero bgd), flickering pixels are removed with a
    cutoff threshold.
 
 Hints:
 Choose cell size and thresholds based on the expected background and the PSF.
 Use the DIRTYSIS option to examine the anomalous pixel spectra.
 Try a multiple pass clean:
     Choose a PHA cut to optimize the S/N of the flickering pixels,
     then a broad band clean.
 Be suspicious of extended source cleans.
 For very bright sources you may need to turn off t
