Number of peaks found at mFobs-DFmodel map (map cutoff=3.00 sigma)= 329         
Filter by distance & map next to the model:
   mapped sites are within: 0.313 - 4.656
   number of sites selected in [dist_min= 0.70, dist_max= 6.00]: 322 from: 329
   mapped sites are within: 0.735 - 4.656

peak=   10.833 closest distance to " CG2 VAL A 230 " =    1.473
peak=    7.220 closest distance to " CG2 VAL A 296 " =    1.
