! Inverting map 
! Your choice of large map pixels excluded 1.03% of the data.
!  The x-axis pixel size should ideally be below 0.1656 milli-arcsec
! Added new window around map position (1.2, 0.2).
! clean: niter=100  gain=0.03  cutoff=0
! Component: 050  -  total flux cleaned = 0.070825 Jy
! Component: 100  -  total flux cleaned = 0.112338 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 100 components = 0.112338 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.0123
