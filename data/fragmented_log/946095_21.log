! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = -0.00850662 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.017637 max=0.014177 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000079 rms=0.004229 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 1.67707 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.6 minute time intervals
! Adding 13 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 64 components and 1.67707 Jy
