  5. To prevent crashes, Luciana will be restarting the HV 
     program every morning.  This might temporarily affect the 
     iFix connection.  Go upstairs to the Plug HV PC.  You might

     That would be Luciana doing something.  Be patient.  IFIX 
     might take up to 5 minutes to update.</pre>
