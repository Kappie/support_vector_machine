! Component: 150  -  total flux cleaned = 0.002513 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00262473 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.00262473 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.004486 max=0.004193 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000099 rms=0.001140 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 2.57362 Jy
