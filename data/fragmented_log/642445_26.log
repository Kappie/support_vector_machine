<pre>Having troubles with L2 clustering (I think) with a cable
unplugged.   Left plot for Clist is run 128891 with
cosmics_notrack trigger and all cables plugged in.
Right plot is Clist run 128892 with top cable of DCAS slot 13, 
crate 0 unplugged.   Isolist looks similar in both runs
so it seems L2 clustering right now doesn't like a 
cable unplugged?</pre>
