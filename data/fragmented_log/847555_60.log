ta in SVTMON comsumer; multiple DONE 
	TIMEOUT from several TDC COT crates. This run was 
	taken on partition 7, w/2 SRCs (elog for details) 
 
20:19   The SVX expert found the reason why two SVT wedges 
	were missing. Consulted also w/SVT pager and decided 
	(1) to end the run and include the missing wedges, 
	(2) declare SVT data good for this run because these 
	two wedges were missing also in hardware DB (so 
	everything should be correctly accounted for).
