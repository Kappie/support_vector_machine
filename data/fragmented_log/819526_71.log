restore: Substituting estimate of restoring beam from last 'invert'.
! Restoring with beam: 0.8524 x 2.375 at -8.167 degrees (North through East)
! Clean map  min=-0.0045576  max=1.5728 Jy/beam
! Writing clean map to FITS file: J0730-1141_X_1999_12_20_pus_map.fits
float peak_flux
peak_flux = peak(flux,max)
print "The peak flux is",peak_flux
! The peak flux is 1.57278
