<b>pcal04</b> I asked specifically before I left for a documentation of the problem found in pcal04 and see none.  At
that time it was thought that this might be a VRB problem, and
I requested that all of the error messages be documented carefully surrounding this problem.  All I can figure out now
is that pcal04 is out with <i>no reason given</i>!
