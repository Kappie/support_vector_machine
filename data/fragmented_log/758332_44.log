 PROGRAM TO MAKE AN SIS SCIENCE FILE CLEANED OF ANOMALOUS PIXELS.
 
 * Anomalous pixels may consist of at least two populations.
 
 1. Persistent HOT pixels are removed by comparing to the chip mean.
 
 2. Flickering WARM pixels are removed by comparing to the cell mean.
 
 3. In faint areas (zero bgd), flickering pixels are removed with a
    cutoff threshold.
