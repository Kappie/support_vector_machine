t all 4  
reces boards. 
  I triggered the LA with the BERR* line on the VME backplane. 
Looking on the Alpha PCI bus, I see the problem is that  
the CIA chip doesn't respond to a vme read (via the universe) 
when the CIA has just read a reces board.  
  Perhaps the crate controller code could be changed so that it 
it retries after getting a vme berr, and only gives a dto if 
it gets several in a row.
