<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Again, we finished the run/store we inherited from the owl shift.  This run had the silicon detectors turned off, due to beam in the abort gap.   
 
Accelerator studies followed, for the remainder of the shift.  There aree no plans for data until tomorrow's day shift.</pre>
