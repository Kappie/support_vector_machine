<p>||<font color='red'>SVX Cooling Alarm</font>.  Pretty much the exact same thing as occured <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2001&action=view&page=513&frame=2&anchor=15:04:22'>yesterday</a>.  A L00 gas trip caused flow to be lost on the east side.  This resulted in sono-alarms and brought down the silicon racks (normal?) which in turn gave us foghorn alarms.  Cryo-techs were able to get things working again in a few minutes.  Main silicon pager was notified.
