otal flux cleaned = -0.000672716 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 100 components = -0.000672716 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.003119 max=0.004504 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000050 rms=0.000809 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.804871 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal over 0.6 minute time intervals
! Adding 7 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 73 components and 0.804871 Jy
