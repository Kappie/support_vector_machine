not output any data at all, and channel 45 
              shows the "split pulse problem". Symptoms of this 
              problem: the boards outputs two hits for some 
              of the events. The second hit begins 1 ns after 
              the first one ends. The sum of the two pulse  
              widths is consistent with the expected output 
              pulse width. It seems that some glitch is causing 
              a single bit to be held low. This problem occurred 
              on channel 4
