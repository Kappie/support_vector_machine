****************** REFINEMENT STATISTICS STEP BY STEP ******************
leading digit, like 1_, means number of macro-cycle                     
0    : statistics at the very beginning when nothing is done yet        
1_bss: bulk solvent correction and/or (anisotropic) scaling             
1_xyz: refinement of coordinates
