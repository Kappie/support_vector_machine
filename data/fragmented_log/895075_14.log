! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.0386762 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.0386762 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.006062 max=0.011048 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=-0.000090 rms=0.001980 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.33401 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
! Adding 24 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 36 components and 0.33401 Jy
