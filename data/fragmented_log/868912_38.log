! Component: 150  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00411018 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.00439427 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.00439427 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.002025 max=0.002288 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000058 rms=0.000596 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.931488 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
