total flux cleaned = 0.000426309 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.000458203 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.000458203 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.002444 max=0.002846 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000068 rms=0.000708 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.360793 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
! Adding 26 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 80 components and 0.360793 Jy
