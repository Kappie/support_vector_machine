s on layer 7 are found at phi coordinates 0 and 35. 
 
2. There is a problem with bunch crossings 50, 103, and 156. At 
   these bunch crossings phi side pedestals are 0 and z side 
   pedestals are too high. See plots

3. The front end of the W 1 6 -A Z is dead. Is the AVDD power supply OK? 
 
(W 1 6 -A Z means west barrel, layer 1, phi wedege 6, west halfbarr
