rors in  
unpacking TC2D and the histograms are not reasonable. 
Nathan fixed and tested the Trigmon version with  
isolation in it but it only has the seed information,  
no energies yet.   So we took a lot of data but don't 
know the quality yet.   
Run 128661 had a DCAS cable unplugged as a test.   
Runs 128676 and 680 had all cables plugged in.   
 
Trigmon showed Iso and Clist in sync at all times in all  
runs.  We left Isolist plugged in and request that others 
do so as well unless a problem is seen
