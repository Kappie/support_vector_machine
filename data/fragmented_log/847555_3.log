nd perhaps SVT seem to be responding to
the special TAXI word in a way they didn't during the torture tests (it is hard to say if it happened in the data run, since
other errors were occuring at higher rate).<P>
Next step (already underway) is to query TDC/SVT people to see if the
response to the "express L2A" can be simply disabled by VME.
Only when that is answered will we reattempt this with any beam time.
