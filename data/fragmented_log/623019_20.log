stribution is a gaussian-like shape 
             with a rms < 1 ns.  
 
 tdc 561597: Problem in Start_ch50 - Start_ref distribution. 
             We get 2 populations: 80% at -244 ns and 20% 
             at 1804 ns. This problem may be due to a problem 
             with the calibration cell on the TDC - switching 
             to a different pulse caused this problem to go  
             away. Oddly enough, when I run this test with 
             front panel input (via ASDQ pulsing) I see two
