 Component: 150  -  total flux cleaned = 0.0172711 Jy
! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.0180429 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.0180429 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.010225 max=0.015193 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000617 rms=0.003152 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 1.96383 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
