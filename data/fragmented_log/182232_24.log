the Silicon crash button at 68K.  During this run the last 4 CN on L3 were again green the entire time.  Apparently cleanup of L3 and EVB didn't help.  Waiting until Boris comes in for 8 am meeting, to ask him to reboot b0l3u04 (Christoph's idea)

of course, we removed all Silicon from the runs after the crash button was hit...
