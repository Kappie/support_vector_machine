! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.0513624 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.0513624 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.018329 max=0.015215 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000694 rms=0.003975 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 1.23568 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
! Adding 14 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 36 components and 1.23568 Jy
