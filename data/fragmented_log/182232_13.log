.  First two hours spent getting hardware event builder to work with source calibration running.  Remainder of time sourced 10 tubes (per quadrant) in 10 separate runs:  all of sector 0  PEM and PHA, half of sector 1, PEM only. (plus corresponding sectors in other quadrants).  Numerous problems with run control.  Even when no problems, setup of each run takes as long as poking one tube. 
The run numbers are 121521, 524, 526, 532, 534, 536, 538, 539, 541, and 547.   </pre>
