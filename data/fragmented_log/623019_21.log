 tdc 561607: Problem in the Start_ch69-start_ref distribution. 
             There are three populations in this distribution. 
             Each population has rms <1 ns. 
             The means of the populations are seperated from  
             each other by about four ns. Also, the output 
             width of channel 69 has three populations. Each
