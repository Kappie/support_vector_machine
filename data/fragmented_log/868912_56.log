! Component: 200  -  total flux cleaned = 0.000179751 Jy
! Total flux subtracted in 200 components = 0.000179751 Jy
! Clean residual min=-0.001875 max=0.002062 Jy/beam
! Clean residual mean=0.000054 rms=0.000534 Jy/beam
! Combined flux in latest and established models = 0.944049 Jy
! Performing phase self-cal
! Adding 30 model components to the UV plane model.
! The established model now contains 118 components and 0.944049 Jy
