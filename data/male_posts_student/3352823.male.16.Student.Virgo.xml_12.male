Ron looked around erratically for his surfboard. He wasn't far out from shore, but still enough to make an unseasoned swimmer uncomfortable. Ron, however had been swimming all his life and was well accustomed to the sea's ways. He saw the board and swam over to it, the sleeves of his wetsuit stretched against his movements. Grasping around the board with both arms he pulled him self up and swam to shore.       The sun was getting bright now, which meant that all the tourists would be hitting the beach and the water would be filled with people surfing and swimming. The empty beach got closer and closer until Ron could touch the bottom. He threw a bare foot to the sand and waded to the shore, surfboard tucked under his arm. Water soaked the sand underneath his feet, but he didn't care. He shook his hair furiously, making the final last droplets fall away.       Taking his board he thrust it into the sand and sand down next to it. Looking at the wide ocean he thought of the wipe-out he had just endured. "My surfing abilities aren't that bad, are they?" He thought to himself. Indeed, Ron had been surfing for years, and had the injuries to prove it. He smiled at some of the memories he had, including his Dad attempting to surf. It was certainly a sight. He sighed and got up, pulling his board from the sand and walking towards to road. On the way he passed some tourists, dressed in flip-flops, shorts and the ever-popular sun tan lotion on the nose. Ron sniggered to himself as he walked down the hill to his house.       At eighteen years of age, Ron was still living at home. He didn't really see the point as he Dad had made a fortune as a professional athlete. Ron himself was a great athlete, being on just about every sports team there was in high school and getting hundreds of scholarship offers when he graduated. Sometimes he still regretted his decision to deny them all; everyone he knew had gone to University and he had stayed home with nothing.       Still he walked down the road, barefoot and trailing water behind him. He thought of last summer when his best friends came down to visit. They were in a band, After-Two. Lame. But there  were  three members. They lived in Toronto, Canada and had always asked Ron to come visit. But Ron couldn't imagine leaving California. The sun, sand and surf were a vital part of his existence. "My feeble existence" he thought. He turned a corner and walked up the steps to his house.       Mom: “Hey, how was surfing?”       Ron: ”It was good,” opening the fridge for some water. “There are some great waves out there. Some really good ones.”       Mom: ”Oh yeah? Sounds great. You’ll have to tell me all about it when I get back”      She smiled and left the kitchen, leaving Ron alone. The mornings were great for Ron; he was always alone ‘till lunch time which was when his Dad came home from practice.       Ron realized that he was still dripping, so he walked down the stairs to the basement. His basement. He opened the door and went to the bathroom. Closing the door behind him and unzipped his wetsuit from the back and pulled it off. A seven centimetre long cut sat across his chest. He looked at it and ran his fingers across it, sighing he opened the medicine cabinet in front of it. There was some cream in there that his doctor has prescribed for the gash, he unscrewed the lid and rubbed it over the cut. It looked brand new, but it was a reminder from when he was fifteen. That was when Ron’s world came crashing onto him. It still brought pain to him to think about it.  Ron put the tube back into the cabinet, closing it he stared at his reflection. He rubbed his eyes and washed his hands.       Ron’s room was his sanctuary. Sure he loved his parents but they weren’t there as much as Ron would like. Even though he was an adult, Ron still needed guidance especially after what happened. He looked for his elusive phone, eventually finding it under the bed. He dialled and waited for them to pick up.       Dan: “Hello?”      Ron: “Hey! Dan! How are you?”      Dan: “Ronny! You haven’t called in like what… A day. I was beginning to worry.”       Ron: “Ha, you’re fucking hilarious.”      Dan: “That I am.”       There was silence for a while, Ron picked the scar on his chest.       Dan: “So, you call for any particular reason?”       Ron: “Well… Yeah. I got some news yesterday that I forgot to tell you.”      Dan: “Like what?”      Ron: “Well… I’m moving. To Toronto.”      Dan: “You’re coming up here?” Dan said excitedly.      Ron: “I am man! I got a job! The firehouse up there said that I’d be a perfect addition to their team!”      Dan: “Awesome! So when you moving up?”       Ron: “Well. Actually, next week. Apparently all the papers have the done; I just have to sign on the dotted line or whatever.” Ron said.      Dan: “Oh I see. Are actually okay with leaving California? You haven’t done it in a while…” Dan said.      Ron: “Yeah. I know. It’ll take some getting used to-“      Dan: “I’ll say.”      Ron: “But, it’s a great opportunity. It really is.”      Dan: “Well, I’m happy for you Ron. But, hey I gotta jet.”      Ron: “Alright.”        The gulls flew overhead, their wings flapping lightly due to the strong thermals from the ground. Their cries were muffled by the din of the crashing waves below the balcony where Ron stood. He leaned against the railing watching the surf. There was a lone jet skier in the distance as he raced across the waves chasing the sunset.        Dad: “Hey buddy.”        Ron’s Dad appeared behind him, in the doorway of the huge glass doors.        Ron: “Oh. Hey.”      Dad: “Great sunset eh?”      Ron: “Brilliant. Too bad it’s my last.”      Dad: “No it isn’t. You’ll come back to visit. Well… You better come back an visit. Plus, there’s always Christmas.”      Ron: “I guess. There probably aren’t any sunsets in Canada. Just long snowstorms.”      Dad: “That’s the spirit.” He said sarcastically.       They laughed, relishing the moment.        Dad: “You packed?”       Ron: “Yep.”      Dad: “Passport? We don’t want a repeat of last time.”      Ron: “Lay off that will ya?”      Dad: “Oh come on. This’ll be the last time for me to tease you for a while.”      Ron: “That I won’t miss.”      Dad: “You’re very funny”      Ron: “That I am.”
