She fills me to the brink with love and then smiles and I overflow with love. She is love.  We  are love.  I woke up this morning with Jamin beside me (tempting I know). Our night of politics had finally ended with me being asleep and Jamin and Tory watching  Fahrenheit 9/11 Bootleg Edition  (thanks Brice and Kazaa). Dustin dropped by for a few before stumbling back to his car, leaving me to suspect he was under the influence of something... maybe Megan. Jake never showed. And Tory did what only Tory does best and left in the middle of the night.  I took Jamin to his grandma's house in New Haven, not the one that got hit by a pig. I met up with the AP folk at Pizza Hut a little after noon. I'm not only late for class every day, I'm late for lunch, too. I suck. Anyway, we had a good ol' time... actually, no, we didn't. Me and Dustin sat there and talked the whole time at a separate table while everyone else just sat there and pretended to like each other. High school is bullshit.  After that adventure at Pizza Hut, I mowed my grandmother's yard so I could pay for gas to drive to Jami's. I live day to day. I'm still waiting for that huge sum of money to just fall in my lap. As Bill Lumbergh would say, "That'd be great".  I went to Jami's and stayed there until around 7. Then we drove to the movies. We saw  Thunderbirds, The Notebook, The Village,  and  Catwoman.  We watched  Catwoman  the longest and then drove to Mason to make out, because making out in the same place every day just gets old (no, it doesn't). We arrived in Mason and figured out that making out is fun everywhere, but it's funner in bed. So, we went back to our room. I love her.  Val the Gal didn't make Varsity. Poor thing, you would have thought Josh had broken her heart. As it turns out, she would rather be a Varsity cheerleader than have Josh. I'm confused. But, she's still the sister of the girl I'm madly in love with. I wish her the best.  Right now I'm getting ready to go to bed. Tomorrow is the big day (Dave Matthews Band  and  Guster)!  I love you, Jami. Happy blogging, honey.  Today's Song to Illegally Steal from Kazaa is: "A Lack of Color" by Death Cab for Cutie.  "If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here, please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams"  Keep cool my babies... and Jami's a baby's a baby's a baby... I'm a douche, I know. :)
