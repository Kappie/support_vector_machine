With Adam With Rosy; with just about anyone in a 2 mile radius around my body.  The other day, I caught myself trying to get contact high off my piss.  And here I was worried about getting crabs.  Most of it took place at the Friendship Festival, next to the police station.  Yes, let’s stress  next to the police station .  There was a plethora amount of people there.  I was charged down by a group of screaming bodies with cotton candy hanging from their jaws.  Ironically, that was after I scared an elderly couple when they were jay walking.  I’m turning right, and the bastard old man thinks he still has his youth.  I stop, he does the ‘soccer-mom-I’m a grandpa-arm” And screams ‘goddamn kid.’   Seriously?   As I was leaving the other night, I’m pulled out and some fat bitch in a minivan started honking at me.   Oh hell no.  I was going 15 in a 20, but now I’m sitting at 5.   This is what set her salty ass off.  “Fucking go you dumb ass!  Jesus Mother Fucker.”  I take another right, and the blob flies by still honking.  But the traffic is another story.  In the actual nucleus of this foul atom, the trash isn’t caged in a steel frame.  Think the smell of fair food, about 300 of the fat bitches that drive minivans and honk at you, a few rides and it’s hell (that tastes good) on earth.
