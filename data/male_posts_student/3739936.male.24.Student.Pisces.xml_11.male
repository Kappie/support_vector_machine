A few days ago I registered  for a new domain name . . . ermm, that'sfour and a quarter days ago. What the hell? The domain people don't work on weekends? Does the internet shut down on the weekends, go on vacation, go to sleep? No! It's 24 hours a day, 365 days a week (actually, 366 this year.) Ah well, hopefully it will be up tommorow.   Since registering for the domain  name I've done nothing but look at my options as to what to use for the site (did that for a day and a half or so), and then studying some new languages! These languages are Perl (for CGI scripts . . . took a day to get a real good hold on Perl), and PHP (another day to get a good hold.) I love programming, it's the only thing I'm any good at really.   My school isn't doing so well  these days. I get so far ahead of myself (and everyone else) and then I get bored and get behind. My teachers are not always very bright, so often I don't bother to go to class. Instead I generally choose to program in the Computer Commons (just like when I was in high school; skipping class to go to the library and read lol . . . what a dork.)   I will most likely either completely  migrate this site to my new server or I will make a new redirect for it. Should get it a bit more exposure . . . although that doesn't matter much really. It'll be the big site works that I'll want to get exposure for. For anyone that stumbles across this blog, the new site will be at  urlLink http://www.indolentspecies.com   Well, that's it for today. Insanity, don't leave home without it.
