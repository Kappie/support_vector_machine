Ive liked her the whole year but i couldnt work up the nerve to ask her out lol. I did earlier but shes got alot goin on right now so i figuered shed say no. well hopefully she'll have a good time. (I hope i have enough money for everything) lol.yesterday was weird cuz krystal and her boyfriend tim whos like my best friend was pissed at me but its  a long story.everythings cool now i think.oh and if ur reading this stacey, dont hate ur life! i get weirded out when people say that.bye.
