While someone such as Ben Weasel calls the so-called anarchists and communists of the punk movement idiots (including those involved with punkvoter.com), the criticism is somewhat misplaced. There's a big difference between bands such as Bad Religion, the International Noise Conspiracy and Propagandhi and bands like the Sex Pistols, NOFX, Unseen, and Pennywise. It's a matter of rhetoric and engagement with the bigger picture. That's not to say Sex Pistols, NOFX, Unseen, and Pennywise's lyrics are not powerful in regards to their political rhetoric, they do not engage in a more complex discourse of social and political problems. Whether or not these bands and their fans understand the relavence of global capitalism and political economy in the things they sing about is a different story, but simplistic cries of anarchy, murder the government, and revolution sound stupid without good arguments. Indeed for all the problems with the United States, it's not Iraq, China, or various places in Latin America. Simply saying America sucks sounds retarded, when a suburban kid who's parents bought him or her a car for a 16th birthday and is able to listen to various punk bands in it. However, other bands such as Bad Religion encourages not necessarily blind rage against the establishment, but a critical analysis and understanding of the social problems that our world is plagued with. T(I)NC, while much more revolutionary at least has a better understanding of socialism than the average college graduate. Propgandhi's critiques are poignant and point out social problems more so than urging violent unrest.  I think the fundamental problem is with thinking. Not enough people these days think critically about what goes on around them. They accept what bands tell them, what TV tell them, and what professors tell them. I'm a firm believer that objectivity is inachievable and that the best you can do is search for answers in a variety of different places.  However, I am against the arbitrary calling of all people who care about politics hippies. Nevermind that rednecks are worse than hippies and they actually vote in order to make sure they can still carry guns, and keep minority groups oppressed.  While I call for more critical understanding of social issues, I think that the political mobilization of the angry revolutionary bands has some benefits.  ***
