They sell tyres, bikes, household goods, guns, sports equipment, pc stuff, games consoles and games, gardening equipment, toys, medicene... oh yeah and food! LOL  They even had school equipment lists on a rack for the local schools to get what they needed... weird!  It's freaky.  It's almost like a UK Asda because it has the same slogon "Always low prices", has the creeply little smiley face and the same rollback gimmick.  They have live lobsters in a little round tank, you choose which one you want, they kill it and prepare it for you... eugh!  They have rotating bag stands at the checkouts and the till people pack for you (I think that's a usual thing in every store in America).  They have prams hanging from the ceiling!!  It's mental lol  I blew the whole of my money on a Gameboy Advanced and a Pokemon Sapphire game, ($115 which is exactly Â£30 cheaper than I would get it in the UK!! In the UK it would have cost = $162)  I've been playing on it all day, and I finally came around and come off it to write today's final journal entry ;)  I've updated the picture gallery in 'Pictures Two' with lots of picture I took today.  I even got a snap of one of the stands which had guns in!  Today was a brill day, hope theres more of these to come eh :)
