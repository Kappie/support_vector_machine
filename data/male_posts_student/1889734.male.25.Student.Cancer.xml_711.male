Yeah, I have a misplaced sense of my own importance, but maybe I'll rent something you have seen or want to see, and we can talk about it.  Anyway, last night I watched House of Sand and Fog and I felt compelled to blog about it.    What a movie!  This is how films should be made!  Every person in this film is full of pain and doubt.  Each character is simply trying to do what they feel is right, and as the consequences begin spinning, you have a sense of inevitability regarding the outcome.    The characters are just so well portrayed.  Ben Kingsley has vast reserves of dignity, and he plays an exiled Iranian Colonel to perfection.  He just wants to rebuild his life and maintain the dignity of his family, while at the same time demonstrating compassion for his tormentor.  Jennifer Connelly is perfect as a whacked out, depressed woman who can't accept responsibility for her own actions, desperately in need of love for herself and from others.  The actress who plays Kingsley's wife is simply amazing, conveying a sense of compassion and dignity with nothing but broken english and facial expressions.  It is a crime she did not receive an Oscar for her work.  The entire movie is a crime, really.  It recieved a total of three nominations (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Music).  By far, it deserved Best Picture.  I've seen 21 Grams, and I liked it, but House was a better film.  I really can't understand why House was so  urlLink snubbed .    In watching the raw pain of this film, it is obvious that no studio suit got anywhere near making 'suggestions' on how to 'improve' the bankability.  I'm thankful for that.  House pulls no punches, and if you are a thinking empathic person, it will really strike you.   This one gets the EB stamp of approval.
