Here are they:  - Chieftec CX-01B-B-W  - ASUS K8V Deluxe  - Kingston HyperX 2x512MiB  - Plextor PX-712A - DVDÂ±RW  - Samsung SyncMaster 957 P monitor  - Sapphire RADEON X800 XT   - Logitech Cordless Desktop MX   - Processor - AMD Athlon 64 3400+  - Epson Stylus C46 - Printer  - Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 160GiB Sata  - Seagate Barracuda 200GiB Sata  Then I'll just have to wait for it to arrive : My ISP has also begun to monitor outside temperature, they're monitoring it about 30 kilometers away from me, so it shouldn't be so different from here(Norwegian): http://svorka.net/stats/temperatur.html The blue is the temperature in Celsius.
