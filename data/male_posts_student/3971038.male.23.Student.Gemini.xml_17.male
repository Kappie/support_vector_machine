To be precise: Im thinking of the times when Zaky tried to get me and this guy called Firly together when I was in Sec 4... it was damn funny.. thinking again... Seriously I forgot abt him totally til i bumped into him at wholivesnearyou.com. Nice to communicate with him again...  Right now listening to songs from 1997 and 1998... the Alanis Morrissette.... BSB, Macarena... I did that alot when i was in sec 3. hehehehe..... so embarrassed.... This morning I met Ang Siok Ching... now aka Crystal Ang.. hehe... while having breakfast with Nas at McDonalds in causeway point. Talked about good old times....  Right now listening to BSB All I have to give... What i remembered most of this was me, fauziah, juliah, haryana, haryani and shuyu at some bus stop outside kallang netball centre... at about 11pm... no ones ard... we sang this song.. its was a hit by the way at that time.... its very nostalgic... miss those times...
