Mike and Jess went to Grove City, David and Sarah were both in the Air Force training with Mike.  I'm still getting to know everyone but it looks like we have a good group.  Sarah went to Penn State and is quite loyal to that school.  So we hung out at my place for a while and then around 830 Mike, Dave, and I went to a med school frat party.  I didn't even now they had frats at medical schools.  It was a decent party.  I happily drove because Dave and I got up this morning to run 8 miles (yes, we are crazy).  Anyway, there were a lot of 2nd year students at this party.  It wasn't really like a true frat party because basically if you went to PCOM, and even if you didn't, you were allowed to be there.  This other girl Sarah, whom I met during the pub crawl last Friday (good times were had for all) came later in the evening and we talked for a bit.  She is a friend of Andrea's (another grove city grad) and is from Erie, PA.  She seems to be down to earth and in the very least I hope to hang out with her and her friends sometime.  I am not actively pursuing anyone to date but we shall see what happens.  There are a lot of girls at the school with boyfriends/engaged/married and so it is a little difficult seeing what you are getting yourself into.  Priority numero uno is doing well and learning the material.  I studied for about 3 hours today and went over things we learned this week and tomorrow I am going to the gross lab to brush up on a few things and then I'll have to read for Monday's numerous lectures.  So far the material is manageable.  The key is to just stay on top of it.  Simple right?  I think I'm going to cash in early tonight, sleep in a bit and get to church in the morning.  Ok, enough narative...night.
