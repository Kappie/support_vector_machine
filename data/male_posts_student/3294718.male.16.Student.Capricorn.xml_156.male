Take in mind that while I am typing this I just took 3 advil, a vicodin and a antibiotic and have been for the past 18 hours, bear with me. Different sections may bleed into eachother.  Storyline/Effects of Actions: The story starts you out as a 15 year old boy whos parents have just been killed (and his dog nailed to the door of his house). In this first part, you do "kid" things and is basically I warm up for the rest of the game. Imagine it as a really big tutorial. To give an example, a merchant may ask you to watch his items and if you do he will give you money. Now the goody-goody thing to do would be to watch his stuff and accept the money. The neutral thing would be to just take some stuff without accepting his offer. The evil thing would be to take his stuff and accept his offer. Now unlike in a game like Morrowind, this game spans your characters whole lifetime, and small choices can have unseen consequences in the future. For example, when you grow up, this merchant could remember your thieving ways and sell to you at insanely high prices, or not at all. If this happens, you can kill him, and if you do he won't come back. This can also have large effects. For example his relatives and friends will hate you, bandits and such will come to revere you and you could get a nice big bounty on your head so a  different  cpu controlled hero in the game could come kill you. After you are a kid, you age and become older and continue aging throughout the game. This game has a main story line, but basically, you can completely ignore it if you want and can continue playing long after you complete it. There are also literally hundreds of side quests to keep you busy. Unlike a lot of games, these side quests are actually worth your time. The rewards won't be a can (because we aren't all goats) they could be anything from money, exp or maybe a new sword. Going along with this sword thing, the sword you use will eventually come legendary. It may even get its own name depending on what you do. You can even use a frying pan as a weapon, so I'm going for the name of "Griddle of Justice." Your own character can also get a unique nickname depenidng on his actions. Such things as your tattoos or your hairdo will also become legendary. Someday, you may wander into town and you will see a punk with YOUR haircut and one of YOUR tattoos. Now, if you were badass you would kick his ass. If you were goody goody you would pat his head and say good boy. Throughout, you will also have rival heros that people can also idolize, so you may also see an army of "archnemesises." Going further into the effects of action part, if you were to say be bad, you would start looking bad. Your skin would get white, your eyes begin to turn red, lose hair, get a evil, fiery aura around you, grow horns, and have flies start flying around you. Good on the other hand will give you lighter hair, a glowing compexion, higher cheekbones, a halo, a light glowing aura and butterflies fluttering around your head. Also, there are a number of normal towns. These towns will throw a welcome party if you are famous for your good deeds. If you are evil, they will hide in their houses where they wait for you to slaughter them. Your home town is different, it will love you no matter what, much like a modern day Ghengis Khan. Then there is the bandit town, the Pequot of the game. This is where the killers and robbers hide out and these guys will easily accept your evil side.  Fighting/weapons: Fighting is pretty simple. Basically you use combos of buttons to use a melee weapon, and every so often if you get enough hits in a row without being hit you can unleash a special attack with a sweet, short cinematic. You can also fight with a bow. Pretty simple. Now your actualy weapons will evolve with you. You can add jewels, ingravings, or cuts for every kill you get. In this way, your weapon will ride your coattails to stardom. People will recognize it as easily as they recognize you. The other form of fighting is through magic. Basically, you press a button and unleash your magic. There are around 10 different spells I think that each have around 10 levels that you can level them to. Most of the spells are either bad or neutral on that scale, but 2 or 3 are considered "good." So, fighting is pretty simple. You have a health meter and a magic meter. Crap dies when you whack it with your "Griddle of Justice" or when you zap it with a lvl 10 chain lightning.  The World/Graphics/Quests: The world is big. It would take a huge amounts of hours to explore every nook and cranny. But you don't have to look everywhere. All you have to do is go to your right temple (either the good one for goody goodies or the evil one for badasses). Here, you can find people looking for jobs done. Often, there will be a good side to a quest and a bad side. For example, the good temple may have a quest that says rescue town full of people from bandits. The evil half of the quest may say help group of business men deal with trouble makers in town. In this way, things aren't black and white and you may have to read both halves to figure out the real story. The graphics also look pretty good. With characters showing emotion and the such it looks pretty nice. Not going to say its the best animation, but it definately will get the job done and then some. If you want to see it for yourself go look at some screenshots at:  urlLink here . The world's enviroment is also heavily effected by your playing. If you cut down a tree, you will find the stump years later. If you carve something along the lines of "J0hN 1s L33t" it will be there forever unless you scratch it out. Why would you scratch that out though?  Now I have spent a lot of time playing games. Some of my favorites are action RPGs like Metal Gear Solid or Zelda. The only thing wrong with these games is that they lack the option of what to do. Zelda did a good job of fixing this in Wind Waker because it is  so  god damn fun to sail around. Unfortunately, sailing won't win the game for you. Enter: Fable. Now these hours spent avoiding the main quest can have huge benefits. Or, instead of questing, you can sit in your house with the wife and eat food and get fat. Or, you can just become a serial killer and kill every in your town and get the nickname "Chester the Molester." Then, you could have the whole town to yourself. Sweet.  Basically this game combines the best elements of hack and slash, morrowind and an rpg into one game. Comparing Morrowind to this is like comparing the original Zelda to Ocarina of time. It is like comparing Diablo to Diablo II. It is just one game that goes places the other game only dreamed of or hinted at. If anyone has other questions go ahead and ask. Now it is 6 and these pills rock. I can't type very well. On almost every word I have to go back and fix it. That's why it took me an hour. I will type a sample sentence. Today, am i playn on...WTF... I didn't even mean to type that. I was going to try to say "Today, I plan on..." Whatever. I'm going to go eat some ice cream and drink some liquid drink.
