Like "which hippopotomatic actress will you marry?" or, "what type of wool are you?" well here is a chance to goof off at work, and help science in the process, and maybe learn a little something about yourself too.  The  urlLink Implicit Association Test  measures your responses to words and images, and suggests which words and images you might have an implicit bias towards or against.  take a couple of practice tests, then sign up to take the full scientific battery (60 tests!)
