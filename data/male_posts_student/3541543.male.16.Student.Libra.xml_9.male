I just want to say it was totally awesome that I got to see you the day before I left. I'm going to miss you a lot and I'm hoping for the best. And I will miss all my guy friends also, shayan, sprint, maher, kyle, forste, marsh and others. But I'm going to try and have fun without you all. Alright well that is it for now. see ya later
