Friday, I didn't do anything.. that I remember, at least.  No wait I had an interview at Best Buy.  I think it went pretty good.  I have another interview Thursday.  Saturday, nothing really, except Whit came over and I beat her in NBA Live 2003 best of 3.  I won the first two games.  She will make a comment that she was tired and that she only had 2 hours of sleep.  Don't believe her.  It's all a big cover for the fact that I beat her fair and square.  Yeah.  Detroit what?  Didn't think so...  Sunday went and played 2 games in Independence.  That was alright.  We lost the first game by 1.  We won the second game by 1.  Pretty close stuff.. yeah.  That was my weekend.  Boring.  Hopefully this week will go faster and maybe I'll have something to do next weekend.  Peace.
