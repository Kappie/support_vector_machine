Your family, friends and your children will miss you as terribly as you miss them and they'll never want you to leave their side again. It is the sad true nature of the military family. This is something you're going to have to face square one or you're doomed before you begin.  You say you want to enlist to provide a better life for your children? Wrong, dead wrong if you're enlisting for the benefits. There are a lot of easier ways to make a living than being in the military because it's not just a job, it becomes your whole life.  You have to be prepared to drop everything you're doing and leave everything you love in the name of duty. The hours are long, the pay is lousy and the working conditions can be totally brutal and if you stay around long enough, friends die and you will see combat. It is the true nature of military life.  You enlist to serve your country because you believe in who you are and what you're doing as an American servicemember. In fact, you believe so much that you willingly put your life on the line in accomplishment of your unit's mission and most importantly, to protect the lives of your friends, your fellow servicemembers.  If you're enlisting for any other reason, you're fooling yourself and you'll make a lousy servicemember because you're breaking the most basic fundamental trust you make when you raise your right hand and swear in. That basic trust is serving others before you even begin to think of yourself. Thats why we call it "The Service" because we serve others, it's as simple as that.  If you can put others before yourself and even your own family, welcome aboard. If you can't then don't put yourself or the people around you in that situation because you won't be any good to your friends or your unit.
