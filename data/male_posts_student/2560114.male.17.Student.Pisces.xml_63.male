How in the hell did my life get better???haha...funny how all of those were answered yesterday...She had been tryin to get him for like almost a year now and her attempts were unsuccessful, but i encourage her to do the right thing...she tried to get me for...a week. Yeah, well i know she tried her hardest, but i guess a week did not do, so its back to bein this shit again. Well until she realizes that he doesnt want her or she realize that she doesnt need him or i realize that i must move on...its over. But until those days come, then i must b on the process of letting go...its a long one..but ive been betrayed too many times, ive been hurt too many times, and ive been lied to too many times...all i want now is for her to b happy and for me to b happy especially.   ...a week
