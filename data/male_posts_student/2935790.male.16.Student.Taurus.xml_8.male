Now, lets just say, hypothetically, that the music industry was about  music , they wouldn't have jobs, n'est pas? So, really, what are these guys getting paid for?  Oh yeah, they can rhyme.  You see, back when I was in  kindergarten  I also learned how to rhyme.  Why am  I  not making millions? I must have used proper grammar or real words, or maybe it's because I did not mention my 'gat' enough. So in pseudo-conclusion, they are getting payed to flash their bling, and shake their tail feathers.  What the hell?!  Millions of people work hard, get educations, get jobs that help today's work force, and by the time they die they will not have made a third of what these  artists  are making.  Problem number 1:  Rap artists + Money = More Rap Artists  You see, a rap artist can coast his way through life.  After making billions, his brother says, "Yo, G, can you loan me a record deal or two, bro?"  Problem number 2:  This means the more rap artists we have now, the more dumbass rap artists we will have in the future.  I call it the  Parabola of Brothas  effect.  y = x^2  .'. Sean goes on a rampage and destroys the earth. And because it's in popular culture, kids will eat out of these turds' hands.  Problem number 3:  The future, a generation of illiterate gang members.  If you're not in a gang, ask yourself this, how many people do you know who are in gangs?  Now how many of them can spell "intelligence", "employment", or "literacy"?  Exactly. The only problem is, anyone who complains will get a 'cap' in their ass.   Thank god for skaters.   Don't get me wrong I'm not super pro-punk, but they are the positive to the Thug negative.  I'd like to see a huge gangs vs. skater war, no guns, unless you're a big pussy.  Jackass rap dildos.  Grr.  "Payce" [ GRR! ], Sean
