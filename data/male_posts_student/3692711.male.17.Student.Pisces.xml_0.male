Hehe, I am both excited and worried, cos' my group will be handling children (Not as young as the other group la)! Haha  Upon reaching RIC, we are asked to bring down the tables and chairs for the registration counter. I am like "  huh? why now then set up?  " Nevertheless, we still help them. Then, some of us are asked to go down and ask the drivers to park their car elsewhere. I am included. Wah, here comes another challenge for me... i cant speak Malay, i can only point and smile to the drivers. Though there are malays included, but they are very busy also. In the end, I become a "signboard", car comes, immediately hands up and direct them down to the parking slots. Well, they  should have assigned people there beforehand, organize everything thoroughly .  After that, the even started... Kevin, Wanchoo and I go to the hall where our stations will be started. I am impressed by the primary school kids! Though it's only colouring and using only colour pencils, they can actually blend the colours very well. The strokes and techniques used are also very pro!! Even for me, in sec sch then make use of colour tonning.... so ashame.. lol. There is this kid, stunned me. He is very young and his command of colours are very "chim"! Very nice... I am amused by him throughout this colouring session!  urlLink    "This is that boy, Timothy and his colouring piece!! Nice right?" urlLink     After that, is lunch time. Well, nothing much to say about lunch... lol... *ahem* Then, we proceed to our next station, a garden walk. The kids are splitted into two groups. And that boy (which i just mentioned above) happened to be in my group. He's very adorable and hyper active!! He knows malay, chinese, cantonese and english... wow pro right? He's only primary 3!!  During the garden walk, I get to know more about the boy. His name is Timothy. Chinese name: Zhen Xiao Yao (Really (care)free). When i heard his name from him, I am like " wow still got people at this era called such names ah " He's very fun and active... how I wish I have a little brother like him.  After the garden walk, we have the games session at the pavailion. Haha, all of them are engrossed with the games though some are really lame... Then Kim came with some Nemo keychains and start to ask questions. If they guess correctly, they get the keychain. Well, of coz, that Timothy gets one.  urlLink    "Timothy and some of the kids @ the pavailion" urlLink     Then comes the speech thingy. Some of us followed Mr Ng down to the presentation, speech thingy. I am included so are Eugene and MeiLing. Lol, before we even enter, we asked Meiling to control her luaghing pitch in any situation. hah. Then, Meiling keep telling me that the VIPs all look like terrorists (cos they hav beards and moustach) and keep giggling at herself. Then when the camera faced us, I will nudge her and we will act as though we are listening etc. Haha so fake right? Like Mr Goh loh =p Then here comes the WED mascort, a monkey. In the middle of the presentation, the monkey's pants keep dropping and Meiling is like laughing like you know... haha, but damn funnie loh, keep pulling it up.... in the end, they remove the pants... haha. Oh, after the speech and presentation, we are asked to set some fishes free into the pond. Well, some of us managed to set them free. Haha.  urlLink    "Freed the fishes!! Wanchoo caught on the act!!" urlLink     After that, we go up to the hall, all exhausted. Some sleep inside, 3 bridge "tables" and some playing games... lol... and WR has this love game using the poker cards... lol very interesting. And we call it a day after that...  Well, today best thing is the WED and Timothy. Really, leaves a big big memories on this very day...
