We had some speeches from the national officers, and so on.  Also, if you watched  The Apprentice , do you remember a contestant named Kwambe (or something like that)?  Well, he was there and made a brief speech to the FBLA group.  All in all, it was pretty fun.  Today, I woke up late... at about 10:00 AM.  Then we went to Sonic to get some food and we headed out to the conference center.  I attended one workshop while I was there and it was pretty boring to say the least.  I'm about to head out to lunch in a few minutes and then I will be back at the conference center for more workshops and exhibits!  The award ceremony is on Saturday.  Wish me luck!
