Nothing like listening to some Social Distortion ("Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell" at the moment) on the eve of what could and should be a great local punk rock show. We're playing tommorow night with some great bands like Wasteland D.C. whom bring a more old-school hardcore sound, Saltwater Vampires who are more of the Screeching Weasel-style of pop-punk (very good I might add) and a band I've never seen or heard but have heard good things about in City Water Bandits.  It's fucked up really. This month is our two year anniversary of our Punk Rock Night debut, which marked the start of a strech of time when things were really going well for us locally. People liked us, or seemed to have liked us. I know the kids liked us, but I think the older crowd just thought we were a cute punk rock band during a time when not many kids our age were playing the style of punk rock we played. It was only two fucking years ago but now in many ways we've been forgotten by those same older people, and some of the younger kids who have grown up and gone on to other things. There are many more punk bands of different varities these days around Indy so it's almost like we're a dime a dozen. Although the minute I start thinking that I quickly take a look at our influences and our sound and I can't really put a finger on any other local band that we sound like or quite sounds like us. We aren't hardcore, we aren't street or oi and we aren't pop. I guess we have a unique sound, often compared to that of the Ramones, yet not as poppy.  In the three years this band has been together we've been in the spotlight locally, somewhat forgotten, and almost re-discovered ourselves as of recently. And really, we never went away. Jonny and I refuse to let this thing die. The minute I start thinking it's time to end (and I have many many times) something in me takes over and says to keep going, you've come this far. Three years is a long time for a local punk band...hell, ANY BAND...to stay together. I hear of great local bands coming and going all the time, yet when our time comes and it's time to split, will people remember us? If they do, if they remember ANYTHING, I hope it's that we were a group of kids who loved punk rock and didn't give a rats ass what anybody thought about us. Did we or do we want to be liked? Of course. But most important to myself, Jonny and Matt is that WE like the shit we write. If you like it, we greatly appreciate it and thank you for spending your hard earned money on a 30 minute set with us.  Our lineup has changed, but the core has always stayed the same. Our music has changed a bit, but in general it's always been somewhat in the ballpark of what we were trying to achieve soundwise. Still, I'm not completely satisfied with what we've done in the past (sound wise and god knows our first album was a piece of shit...thanks again Jim!) or where we are now, however I do think we are headed in the right direction. Jonny and I are stubborn bastards. We know what we like (him more-so than me) and we are very hard to work with. Just ask TJ, Matt, Zack and Kyle, all former members (Matt being now BACK in the band for a third time). People don't always seem to understand why we go through members like we do. I think it's because Jon and I are THAT hard to work with and we strive for perfection, even though we know that based on our talent levels we probably aren't going to achieve it very often in our lifetime. Yeah, it's something that him and I need to work on a bit, I would say myself more-so than him.  So I'm starting to rant, and finding it difficult to figure where exactly I'm going with this and really, who the hell is even going to read this? The minute this shit starts to sound like a "Dear Diary" I'm stopping. If you do find yourself reading this, I'm not going to thank you or anything. In fact, I pity you! You fool, have you nothing better to do than to read my fucking "blog?" OK, it's stop time now.
