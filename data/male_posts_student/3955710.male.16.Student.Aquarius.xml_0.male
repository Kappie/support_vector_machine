This week's sorta boring really. There's loads I could do, but I can't be bothered to do. Like the aforementioned Sainsbury's application form. My mum asked me why I hadn't done, so I said 'mental illness'. This is actually true. I suffer from a behaviour pattern called Avoidant syndrome, which is a common psychological problem where people with the syndrome prefer to let others make big decisions for them. There is actually a really good DIY psychiatric test online, here's the link.       urlLink http://www.4degreez.com/misc/personality_disorder_test.mv       Sorry, I suddenly realised we have 5 street atlases next to me. I don't have a clue why. My strange family. Thinking of families, they're going to scrap the sitcom 'My Family'. Yay! It seems that the best shows have the shortest runs, while the crap ones go on for ever. I don't really believe about the whole going out at the top stuff, I think that's shit. Will  Grace has done like 100 episodes, and Friends did 200+.      Thinking of TV, I was watching a show called 101 Embarrassing Sexual Accidents last night. Some gay blokes decided to make bedtime fun by pouring quick setting concrete up their ass. Concrete sets pretty quickly, especially 'quick setting'. You should always read the label! Also Taiwanese women enjoy putting their mobiles up their ass, with the ringtone on vibrate. But it said this gives you incontinence, so don't try it kids!      See ya   THOM
