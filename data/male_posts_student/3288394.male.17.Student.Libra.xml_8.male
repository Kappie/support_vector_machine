Sole Jeans. Soul Sol. Not time yet. Over and under, out. Run in between the planets because my back's too dry to fly. New ones in the side but not so new. Rinse, and repeat. Glare, blink, stare, pop. Circlet of mention better left unknown. In the dark doghouse of the night we shiver. No whispering for milk, all we have is elbow grease. Blue angels plummeting through the pudding to fing bananas. Good-bye. ~!@#$%^*()_+=-0987654321`
