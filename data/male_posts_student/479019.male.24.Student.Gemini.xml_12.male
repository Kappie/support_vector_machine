Well I think starting off the day getting NOFX/Rancid tickets for 4/18 in Anaheim is a good start! This is so cool. I started off the year with Bad Religion, and now I'm going to go see NOFX and Rancid. I consider 1994 the best year of music in my life time and all these punk bands churned out some awesome stuff!   Working out always seems to make me feel better when sick and today was no different. Despite choking back some vomit, I had an epiphany that I know have a game plan to deal with one of my frustrations.  Mushroom pizza is always a smile maker!  Notre Dame is slowly but surely taking shape. I need a couple days before I continue work due to the paint needing to dry up a bit.  The thing that sucks the most about being sick is not being able to drink because I don't want to mix alcohol with cold medication. I don't want to know the meaning of life that bad.  Now for some reading, Simpsons, Malcom in the Middle, and probably some snacks in there somewhere.  ***
