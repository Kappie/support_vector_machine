Cuz yest I know I very late then sleep... SMS with Darius mahz... Then this morning I wake up ma shang look for my phone and see got his sms mahz... And so coincidence ma shang got sms coming in... Hahaz...  Anyway, both of us didnt sleep well and we fall asleep while waiting for each other sms... Hahaz...  Im busily munching on my Coco Krunch... And doing basically nothing. Later I would have lesson from 12 to 4... What the hell... Damn boring.    I also discover that every morning I wake up got a basic routine. Wake up, look at phone then the time, then turn on computer, then went to Gunbound website check my stats, then over to some other website check WWE de new, then over to check WWE Card Games de news, then went to my email inbox then over to blog. Hahaz... I should actually include the stupid thing call 'Ole' into my routine cuz the Ole is something like a bulletin board for TP to give us news or what. How lame...  I got a feeling my studies is piling up and a very sick feeling that my handphone bill is gonna cost a bomb... Oh fuck... >.
