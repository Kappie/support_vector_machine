Verbally abuse reporters. I’m serious. If you’re at a political event and you see someone with a notebook, walk up and ask who they’re with. Then give them an earful about what whores they are. If they try to weasel out by blaming their editors or producers, ask them where they draw the line, and run that analogy all the way to Hitler, if need be. The media cooperates with Bush because we don’t make them pay a price for their complicity. Social shunning is a powerful tool, and what better punishment for media whores than not being able to hang out with the cool kids and having to miss all the best parties.  And for those of you who  urlLink like   urlLink pictures  (courtesy of Bob Herbert at Tom Tomorrow).  It's enough to warm the cockles of this dirt poor college student's heart.
