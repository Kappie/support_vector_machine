I know i said in my last post i was supposed to go back last wednesday, but my shoulders were aching so bad i said forget it, so yea it basically took me 1 week to get over the pain.. Call me puny..a wuss..or wutever u like, but hey everyones got their own limits =P  Since this is my 2nd time there im beginning to get used to the place, i can already recognize some ppl who were there last week as well joining in for the 6.30 aerobics class. Its quite fun really watching a group of about 15 people dance around in a room with see-through glass. However, it is possible to pick out those guys who are more to the 'feminine' side, if u know what i mean.. ;) Aiyor watching these ppl do aerobics or even just having a general conversation can be quite unnerving at times. But then again i know the world out there is full of these type of ppl, and hey this is a free country right?(to a certain point..) So since my cousin is already leaving tmr, ill hve to join the club if i wanna keep this up. I suppose ill take their student membership since its not tht expensive, although i hve to be in AND out by 5pm becoz then peak hours start. Wonder if i can get a few friends along with me..? hmmm...  In school things are pretty much the same, although accounts teacher has changed all our seating during her period(im sitting at the back dammit) nothing has really changed in class. This isnt very comforting since exams are really getting closer everyday and no one seems to be noticing it(yea tht spm countdown on the sidebar serves a purpose =p). I really wry for myself sometimes if i can really get into studying b4 its too late and i find myself cramming at the last minute for all the subjects im taking. My friends arent helping. I sometimes wry more for them than myself. :D But im sure we'll all pull through nicely, i mean its not like we're entirely stupid...right..??  Well as u can see my blog has added on quite a few things. From falling snowflakes to a digital clock and tht spm countdown i mentioned earlier, im slowly but surely getting the hang of this c2pid html stuff. Pity Robyn for not being able to view our codes anymore, i wonder whats wrong..? Dnt wry i dont think its such a big problem, should be able to fix quite easily. And besides, youre the one that taught us all this in the first place, so u should know all this by now right? :D
