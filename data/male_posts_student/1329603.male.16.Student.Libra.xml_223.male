In other news, I have decided to stop being a whiny git until... tomorrow. I don't know... everyone wants to be with someone, or is with someone. Often both. Those who are with someone don't know how lucky they are, and those without don't know the bad they're missing. Does the bad outweigh the good?  Quote of the day: "The long and winding road That leads to your door Will never disappear, I've seen that road before. Don't leave me waiting here, Lead me to your door."  From The Beatles'   The Long and Winding Road   Love, Jon Roskilly
