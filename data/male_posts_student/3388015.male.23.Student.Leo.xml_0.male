Oh well.  Today I woke up, got ready, packed the car full of boxes and stuff, and headed to a garage sale on the way to Rochester.  It was nice.  I bought a great TV stand for my living room.  It even has a swivel top so I can move it one way if I want to watch TV in a different angle or something.  I dropped the rest of my stuff off at the apartment, and realized I forgot my cell phone.  It would have come in handy since Laura and Luke were a little late coming.  We were to meet at 9:45.  So at 10:00, I went and picked up Cindy.  Laura and Luke were waiting on the grass when I returned.  I gave Luke the grand tour and we headed to our first garage sales.  We shopped and shopped and shopped some more.  The one we really liked had end tables (I needed), a coffee table (I needed) and a kitchen table and chairs (I needed).  I told everyone that we'd return later and get these things.  We also stopped at others and I found a brand new set of silverware still in the box, a brand new tie/belt rack (still in the packaging) and other fun stuff.  Out in the boonies, we also found a box of Margarita glasses (9 glasses for $5) and a set of bowls, 10 for $1.  It was an awesome deal.  We dropped Luke off at work and ate lunch at Pelligrinos.  I had a great Buffalo Chicken sub.  We then headed to more garage sales in Chili, Irondequoit (which oddly enough we went a really long ways to get to something that was almost directly north of Chili in Greece) and then returned to one of the first ones to get those ends tables and such.  We made several trips to deliver all the items we bought from this one sale that is only 1 block from my apartment.  The closest sale was the best sale.  We hung out at the apartment for awhile, planned how we were going to set it up and then headed to Movies 10.  We stopped at a pizza place and got a slice, then headed to see 50 First Dates.  It was a really nice movie.  We then went to Target and shopped for some shower curtains.  I didn't like many of the ones they had, and the ones they did have were $20.  Oi.  Luke picked Laura up at 9:40 and Cindy and I headed back to my place.  Cindy gave me her shop vac, VCR from 1994, soap and a million other things.  I gave her my VCR.  Even trade, right?  Cindy asked me to take her home, so I did and I came back to Brockport.  I don't want to live here anymore.  I can't wait to move.  Tomorrow I'm going to bring the birds to their new home and bring all the plants.  I hardly have anything left.  I wish my bed was already moved.  I wouldn't come back anymore.  Night.
