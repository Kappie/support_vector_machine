As it was lying down on the hot hard asphalt covered street, it made me wonder... shall i share the same fate? A street cat appeared, watching the rat die in the corner of it's eye... already the cat is in it's position to pounce at the slow dying rat, and again, it makes me think... Is someone ready and waiting for me to die? Already is someone in his or her position to pounce? Ready to feast upon my soon lifeless body? Damnit! Someone always has to be on top of the food chain... and how i love how it works... Rat at a corner dying... will it die peacefully? Who knows?
