Gay Marriage: With all the neoclassical architecture in Washington DC, you'd think that man-on-man love would be something politicians would want. Also looking at the statisics on divorce, domestic abuse, etc. straight people have fucked up marriage enough. So maybe no one should want marriage? Emotional attachment sucks ass anyway.  Now playing:  The Sahara Hotnights  - Quite A Feeling  Stem Cell Research: So rectal / colon cancer is expected to cause about 56,730 deaths (28,320 men and 28,410 women) during 2004. I don't know about you, but the thought of someone removing chunks out of my colon, rectum, etc. isn't appealing. If stem cell research can fix my ass, then I'm all for it.  Now playing:  The Sounds  - Living in America  I basically slept all day yesterday. I had to recover from the lack of sleep the night before.  ***
