Found out that her bro found out abt us...she needs to tell her mom...most probaly her mom will object...how? Maybe she can make a deal with her mom? If her results deproves den we break up? I dunno...but as the saying goes...."everything will be alright in the end, if its not alright, its not the end."...i'll hold on to this for the time being...ok...time to go...ciao.
