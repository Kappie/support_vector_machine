My wife and I decided to make it up to them by having them over for dinner and a movie. The movie thing can sometimes be more trouble than it's worth, because quite often the youth group will want to watch something that we wouldn't screen for teenagers, let alone watch ourselves (think  urlLink American Pie ); other times my wife and I will err on the side of discretion and pick a movie more appropriate to their brothers and sisters in elementary school (think  urlLink Jonah -- a VeggieTales Movie ). But I knew that wasn't going to be a problem this time as M-- is a horror fanatic rivaling even myself.  We ended up watching  urlLink Dracula -- Prince of Darkness  and  urlLink The Masque of the Red Death .  urlLink Dracula  was a no-brainer because the girls knew  urlLink Christopher Lee  from  urlLink LOTR  and they love vampires, I have to say that although I normally would rate this film as one of my favorite  urlLink Hammer Films , I found it to be a little slow-paced when viewed with a group. At least it picked up the pace a bit after the young couple escapes to the monastery and the ending on the cracking ice is one of the best conclusions in the whole  urlLink Dracula  series. I chose  urlLink Masque of the Red Death  because M-- had never seen any of the  urlLink Corman/Poe  pictures. I think that  urlLink Masque  is the best picture in the whole cycle. It took the girls a bit to work out that "the monster" they were looking for was the very human  urlLink Vincent Price . (We also scared the heck out of M--'s grandmother who had driven them to town and stayed for dinner. The directors of the films would be proud -- she gasped or jumped at every single shock.)  The verdict? For teens that most likely think of a horror film as something featuring Jason, Michael or Freddy, they were suitably impressed with these movies made almost twenty-five years before they were born. We're planning another double feature soon when I hope to spring some  urlLink Amicus  or  urlLink William Castle  on them...  Young people enjoying  urlLink Christopher Lee  and  urlLink Vincent Price  movies!   In these uncertain times, it kind of makes a guy have hope for the future...
