You know, the black dude? Man...  I could just picture him, wearin some funky ass outfit, wit a fatty afro.  Hella grillin, all smilin playin that song. Hahaaaaaaa....  Anyways, I was watchin this movie, Dangerous Minds, and I noticed, one of the actresses looked alot like the foxy lady in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle. So, I did my research, and found some FLY pictures of this model type girl.  Paula Garces  you light up my life. You on some young vida guerra shit though... whew  Gimme a couple day's, I'll construct a shrine just for her, cause goddamn, she if fly. She in that nickelodeon movie, Clockwatchers or somethin, she dont look bad in that either. Lookin like pmoy01 on the real.  Yeah, might check in once again later tonight, if I don't die in this windsor heat.  Today's Message From Erwin: Any sitings of Paula Garces notify the authorities, meaning me WORD.
