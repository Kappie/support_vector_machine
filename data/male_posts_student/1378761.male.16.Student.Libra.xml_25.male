I went to lunch. I also talked to 2 FBI Agents. Yeah that's like a dream come true. Both of the agents said I can't job shadow them. That's a major bummer. Oh well. I guess I will have to find somebody else.   On Friday we had no school for presidents weekend.  I bought a new pair of boots.  They are steal toe and electrical resistant.  In the afternoon we ganged up with a few other fellows who all had CBs. So we hit the road talking, but didn't get too far. Instead I ended up getting chased by an ambulance because I could not get over in time. Yeah I knew the ambulance was coming, I heard it on the scanner. I followed it because for some reason it was going to Wapak. Who Knows.  Today I had to work 9-1. Yeah it pretty much sucked, but a lot better than working nights. I hate working nights. They asked if I could come in tomarow 11:30 to 1 cause they have like a shit load of chicken going out so. Any was after that I had to stop at the police department. More information later on about this. Right now it is marked confidential. Doesn't that sound so important? It makes me. After that I headed out to the outdoorsman to see what Tim was up to, Tim has to work like 8-4, but just on the weekends. It gets pretty boring out there for him, so plenty of people stop in to talk to him. While I was there Benny came in. I haven't seen Benny in like forever. It was soo weird seeing him again. He has like open heath surgery done so that's why. While I was there I was called by Kimmer, a policeman from SMPD. He talked a little, and I left to go to the police department again. After I left there, as I was going through the aly, I saw some office chairs by the dumpster. We'll get to that latter. So I went home for a while and relaxed. I went to Wapak with Troy, my stepdad, to go to the KOC chicken fry with an old friend. We have been going to this chicken fry there like forever. After that Tim and Josh were back. We drove around a little. After that we got a call and we picked some more people up, we had 5 people in my car. We drove around looking for stuff to do. We went through McDonald's and got 8 waters. There was this bitchy lady at the drive through and she charged us 10 cents each for the waters. Oh well. So we followed the cops around some. Of course they got suspicious and ran my plates. After that I stopped. We dropped everybody off except josh. So we ran to the police department and got the chairs out of the dumpster. Yeah we are pretty much weird.  So that was my holiday weekend in a nut shell. To everyone out there, Happy Valentines Day!!  //ERIC//  Today
