However, the behaviour and quality of employees within the organization have a fundamentally important effect on organizational performance. Much of the managerial discourse asserts that organizational goals are largely achieved through the effort of the employees and if their performance is improved, the organization in turn will be more productive. Constant development of knowledge, skills and behaviour of the employees help the organization grow.  Performance management can thus be defined as the policies, procedures and practices that focus on employee performance as a means of fulfilling organizational goals and objectives. It also acts as a motivating factor to the employees.  Although performance management is a necessary organizational function, it often proves to be a problematic process. Managers are typically loath to pass a judgement on employees. Employees, on the other hand, often say that the process of having their performance appraised is a futile exercise. The HR professionals in the organization sometimes look at it like a laborious routine job.  Some theorists have a view that performance management is a merely control measure used by an organization. The process of measuring, monitoring and evaluating performance does show organization control over the employees. But actually, this control-based performance management system serves to undermine rather than contribute to the performance of employees towards organizational success.  It is now seen as a developmental aspect for the organization and a very useful motivational as well as developmental factor for the employees. It is a move from simplistic trait methods of performance management to one that provides a detailed feedback emphasizing future tasks and goal achievement.  The main component of an organization’s performance management system is the performance appraisal. This is a formal procedure that consists of a systematic performance review accompanied by appraisal of an employee. Performance management is a process whereas, performance appraisal can be said to be a system. There are a number of performance management systems like: · Trait method. · Objective based method (MBO). · Competency based method. · 360-degree appraisal.  The most common of these is the MBO and the competency based methods, although a lot of work is being carried out for 360-degree appraisal system. Organizations are finding it difficult to implement 360-degree appraisal system, so a lot of companies are going for a mix a MBO and 360-degree appraisal system.   To achieve performance orientation, Indian organizations need to focus on Performance Management System (PMS) rather than Performance Appraisal System (PAS). While a PMS addresses all the relevant and inter-related issues of individual motivation and processes holistically, PAS is one of the many sub-processes involved in a good PMS. It is necessary to amend western management concepts to suit Indian socio-cultural context while drawing inputs for designing an effective PMS.         urlLink ">Link
