I really gave my best to make you love me Yet you thought that it wasn't good enough. When will it ever be good enough? When will I be worthy to be good enough? Tell me...  Please...  Let me know. I gave my heart to you, What more do you desire? You became angry, I never thought you could be so selfish. Damn you...  Why did I even bother?  When I told you that, You laughed your evil laugh, You didn't care about me at all... You sadistic, overbearing bitch, I should never had wasted my time on you. Yet, in all my stupidity, I did, And now you laugh for my mistakes.  How could you do that with such pleasure? Such happiness felt in your heart Seeing a boy being tortured. It took me a long time to realize who you really are, It's pathetic, I know, but at least I finally knew, You're nothing but a demon in human form.
