Lawyer is playing solitaire.  You can tell it's solitaire because he's transfixed on the screen and clicking the mouse.  And because he's alone.  Let's call him Fred.]  FRED Come on, black queen.  Give me a black queen.  [LAURA, a slightly older lawyer, is suddenly in the doorway.]  LAURA Looking at interracial gay porn again?  FRED No, just solitaire.  LAURA You working on anything?  FRED Billing code 4123-dash-8.  LAURA What's that?  FRED Bathroom.  LAURA Oh.  I billed an hour for that this morning.  FRED Bored too?  LAURA No.  Mexican.  FRED Gotcha.  LAURA SO you want to help me out with something?  FRED Sure.  LAURA Great.  You're gonna hate this.  It's what we gave paralegals until they unionized and demanded we stop in their latest contract negotiations.  FRED I heard about those.  Is that why the paralegals make more than I do?  LAURA No.  They make more than you because they get overtime when they stay until midnight.  FRED I just get free take-out and a car home.  LAURA Not anymore.  Cars only after 2 AM.  And take-out's only breakfast.  FRED Great.  So what's the job?  LAURA Well, I've got fourteen cartons of paper that were just delivered from the paper factory.  Imagine, a paper factory getting sued and the case demanding a document review.  A paper factory.  FRED Like an electric chair manufacturer getting sentenced to death.  LAURA I hope you do a rotation through the punchline department this summer, because that one died.  FRED Did you mean that to be a pun?  LAURA If you're asking, I guess I need some continuing legal education classes myself.  FRED So you want me to go through the cartons looking for relevant material.  LAURA That's the second step.  FRED What's the first?  LAURA Translating it all from Arabic.  FRED It's in Arabic?  LAURA You think they speak English in Minnesota?  FRED Yeah, I thought they did.  LAURA Not at this company.  They make paper.  They speak Arabic.  And they used these cartons as spitoons for their chewing tobacco.  So you might want to wear gloves.  FRED Wouldn't it make sense to get someone who speaks Arabic to do this?  LAURA Does anything we do make sense?  FRED Good point.  So where should I start?  LAURA Probably with the box marked "1".  FRED At least they use our numbers.  LAURA That's looking on the bright side.  At least you've got a good attitude.  That's one of the things we look for.  FRED What are the others?  LAURA Intelligence, drive, and an inability to say no.   FRED I said no to twelve other firms to come here.  LAURA Then it's out of your system.  FRED When do you need this by?  LAURA Friday.  FRED And then you'll have something rewarding for me to work on?  LAURA Probably not, but you can always hope.  FRED Except on Tuesdays.  LAURA Right, I see you read the rules.  FRED Twice.  LAURA Phlegm.  FRED Phlegm?  LAURA It means good luck in Arabic.  FRED No it doesn't.  LAURA Are you sure?  FRED No.  LAURA Okay then.  Phlegm.  FRED Phlegm.  [Laura exits.  Lights out.]
