I didn't expect to have to say goodbye this soon.  But good did come out of it... there was no downward spiral into the feelings of the past.  Instead, the time was slightly marred by some bad news that neither of us expected, but that nonetheless affects both of us very much.  Unfortunately, it means that now I have these other feelings of sadness about you, and that's fucking me up.    I miss you.  Thank you for coming.  It'll be okay.  Three years will pass, and our friendship won't be any different.  At least I hope not.  That's what's getting me through the initial shock.
