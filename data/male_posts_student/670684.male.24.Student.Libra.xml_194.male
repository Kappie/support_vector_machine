The world is all about discourse, and while Daniel and I have a great time, it is tough to write when only the two of us are having a conversation, and a little daunting (you can't hide in the fray; what you post is what is out there).  I'm working on a new design, and I was working on comment pages, but I think it would be more fun if everyone who wanted could be a full-fledged author.    So you want to write, but you don't know what to write about?  Really, this is for anything...I love the sound of my voice/look of my text, but moreso I'm interested in sharing opinions on shit I know, and learning about stuff I don't know.  I use this forum for two purposes:  airing political laundry (I'm hopelessly liberal, and don't see the people who agree with me aired in mainstream media), and experimenting with writing (the recent crush entries are an attempt to find form/voice for a hypertext retrospective I want to work on this summer).  It's also updates on life, though more overarching and less day-to-day.    So get in on this...email me at  urlLink rolinmoe@hotmail.com  and we'll make it happen.    You're welcome to write what you want, when you want.  The hot tub is always fun with more people.  Daniel and I are sitting, backs up against the water jets, sipping Stroh's and enjoying the atmosphere.  The only problem is that it's a big hot tub, and if I keep having to look at him across the way, with all the sudzy effervesence and Barry Manilow muzack, I'm going to wake up in a bed I don't recognize with a pain I've only known from nightmares.
