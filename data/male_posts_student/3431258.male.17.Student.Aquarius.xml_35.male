When i arrived, decided to make some cleaning in my things before travel. I basically uninstalled all games that i don't play with frequently and i stored all discs in my luggages.   I have one of thoses INCREDIBLE stomachache.   Felt like playing some rpgs so i re-installed  Final Fantasy VII  and  Final Fantasy VIII . I Will restart a new game on VII and try to beat  Fujin and Raijin  in my old VIII game.   Nothing special at the moment. Still a bit shocked by that stuff on  Mikaella .   Well, i'm hungry, gonna check for some stuff.  Regards,  Zephyr
