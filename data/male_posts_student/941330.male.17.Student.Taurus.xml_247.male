(actually, i want to really understand chemistry and u.s. history, but not the way we're doing it.) anyway, today our precious badminton team played james logan...naturally we got murdered. naturally i was lost in the pre-game shuffle and forget to get a ride, so i biked over to the school...wasn't too bad, nice weather and quarry lake looked pretty nice. logan is one mother of a high school, i almost got lost in there (after passing about 20 couples making out in 20 unfindable hiding places). then i found the team and the festivities started and jennie and i were left off the matchups so we played some joke of a jv mixed doubles team that we wiped our toes with 11-6. personally i take it as an insult that i've been going to every practice and open gym all year, playing after school outside brookvale for an hour a day for around a month, going to a few irvington open gyms, staying as late as i can, biking to our first game just to be stuck with a throwaway match? how am i supposed to tell how i match up in an actual game environment if you pluck some random passersby and call that my opponent? tomorrow, i'm going to make a mark on our ladder...give me jv singles 4 for all i care, as long as i can win games and prove i belong on the team.  if i were to objectively look at myself, i would not understand what i see. i am definitely full of contradictions, if not certain cases of outright hypocrisy. i try to maintain a universal respect and kindness towards people, but there are those self-infatuated hosers who i cannot stand. i will be quiet and enjoy solitude, often avoiding groups or more generally people in conversation because i might interrupt or have nothing to say; yet with people i am comfortable with i can act really stupid and weird. i don't mind being passed over for someone who i know is my superior or more fun to be around, doing things for other people, performing the more menial tasks, starting from the bottom; however i bear a certain intrinsic competitive spirit if you will, a pride that will not allow myself to ask for help or take shortcuts, to accept something against my philosophy or below my standards. on a different tack, i often tell myself that today is the day things will change for me, that i'll learn from the past and finally make the right choices...but then i end up making the same mistakes as always. i avoid people for the same reason others avoid me, because for me being so aloof can sometimes make you yearn to be close to someone...yet being on one extreme too long, sometimes you get the tendency to push the other extreme too quickly and it's all gone. that's all i can say...i dream for the future but i live in the past.
