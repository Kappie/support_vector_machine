Children under the age of 12ish shouldn't be allowed to play games more then maybe an hour a day. Parents must teach their children proper "rationing" values. Remember, everything in morderation. Go outside, get some fresh air, then come in, have dinner, and play some games for an hour or two. After they've reached a certain level of responsibility, let them decide how to spend their time. However, continue rationing time if grades drop or they're missing out on a social life.  Let's check out some of the stuff posted there, so I can break it down and tear it apart piece by piece:   "Fact: Videogames aren't just for "fun" anymore, the videogame industry made a net income of $6.3 billion in 2002, surpassing even the movie industry. Developers profit and continue to take advantage of today's youth with cute, loveable, addictive, and recognizable franchise characters. A practice and strategy similar to those used by the tobacco industry."   Ok, here's a fact for you: Games don't require the user to inhale addictive substances or wreck their respitory systems. Good tactic, comparing games to one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but it just doesn't hold up.   "Fact: Videogames have been proven to prevent the development of the proper social skills and interaction needed for a long happy and enjoyable life. Young gamers are prone to being burdened with depression and sadness all throughout their life."   They've got somewhat of a point here, I'll admit. But nowadays, games are part of a normal social life. It's perfectly normal to go over a friends house and kick his ass in some  Halo  deathmatch. Other games promote teamwork. I played  Call of Duty  and  Return to Castle Wolfenstein , WW2 team-based shooters, for a few years competitively, and my tactical thinking skills were increased, plus I made some very good friends. Yes, you heard me. Friends. One or two of them I completely trust. And I've never met these people face to face. It's just not the "standard" social interaction, and people fear what they don't understand. Sort of like aliens, or Martha Stewart.   "Fact: Hardcore gaming not only leads to videogame addiction and abrupt lifestyle changes, but to crime and felony as well. Hardcore gamers never buy computer videogames. Instead, downloading illegally copied videogames or “warez” is the only method acceptable by the underground. Buying a legit copy is grounds for abandonment by community groups. You may not be buying your child videogames, but they can illegally obtain them off the internet."   Wow. Just. Freaking. Wow. This has to be one of the most misinformed, poorly researched statements I've EVER heard in my entire life. (Edit: Aside from anything said by a radical group and/or hippies) While some "hardcore" gamers do get addicted, and that is a problem they need to deal with, I would say most gamers buy their games. Ever notice how the people that are most into music buy their music, instead of downloading it? Because they want to support the artists and the people related to the music. Same deal here. Hardcore gamers want to support the developers and programmers related to the creation of the game, because it's a *lot* of hard work. So we shell out our $40 for a new game, because we want to make sure the developers have what they deserve, some Ramen noodles and maybe a new keyboard.  Enough quotes for now, I don't know how much stupidity this server can handle without collapsing, or something. All in all, MAVAV wants to do a good thing, but it's way too militant and radical in it's approach. I don't want to see "Violent Bloody Man Kills People 4" in the hands of an eight-year-old either, but I'm not going to try and brainwash everyone into thinking that violent videogames make people become criminals, because they don't. I'm one of the least violent people in my school, yet I play the most violent games out there.  You know why? Because my parents and grandparents brought me up RIGHT. They tought me responsibility and consequence, and that just because Sam Fisher just broke a terrorist's neck in half, doesn't mean I should go around town with an AK-47 and kill people.   THAT's the approach groups like MAVAV need to take to be sucessful. I blame horrible parents and poor supervision for kids being violent, not video games themselves. Just like anything else that it's possible to get addicted to (work, drugs, gambling, idleness) you need to ration yourself.  I'd love for someone from MAVAV to read this, and e-mail me, or better yet, post a comment by clicking the small, blue, "x comments" link after the post. It would prove...interesting.
