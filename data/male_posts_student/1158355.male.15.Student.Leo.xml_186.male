We sang to Queen and such. Then when James left, I went to sleep. Then Jay came over and we just hung out and stuff. Now I'm tired as hell and Amanda reminded me to write this. Today, well the 8th, I will be probably waking up around 1, doing my homework and then going out to dinner with my cousins. I don't think I can have a band practice but we'll see. That's all. 5 more days until Florida.
