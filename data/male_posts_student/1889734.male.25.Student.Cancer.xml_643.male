The American gov't didn't fly planes into those buildings-Is this just TOO obvious?!  KRIKE!  I did see a report about the FBI and CIA: very poor inter- and intra-communications, lack of focus, etc....  No apology necessary, but can SOMEONE get this right?  Maybe just one group is necessary-the FBIA perhaps...
