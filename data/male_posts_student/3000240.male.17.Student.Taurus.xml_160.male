I've just purchased this phonomenal polo shirt for Â£5 from the  Officers Club  in Walton, which I'm deeply proud of, and another coup in the transfer market (even though everything from the  Officers Club  is basically a coup considering there is a 70% sale virtually 365 days a year) for my ever improving fashion taste (mwah I sound so obnoxious there don't I).   So my preminition/plan for the next couple of days is:   Preparing my clothes and . . .   Anew CD for the trip to keep me occupied.    Andrew, Claire and Harry are on there way to Spain anyway tomorrow (damn them they got there before me and Father). Iviewed the temperature for Nice and Spain andvarious otherdestinationsfor the forthcoming5 days, and it's around 40 degreesGod damnit; the first " heatwave " of the summer for Europe is approaching anyway, and August has never really been a great time of year to go on holiday anywhere in Europe -far too hot, as on my return I suspectI'llbe are-invigorated, gangsteresque BLACK MAN; If it gets any hotter at least.   Anyway, I was looking at the brochure for New York, and mygoodness there's so many things I want to do in such little time when I'm there, like go to the WWE cafe, Times Square  and  Central Park  and if I play my cards right,the  sex and the city tour  lol, to name just a few.   I've downloaded all these great songs for a new CD, primarilyfor the plane tripand the daily 9 hourbeach session. My personal favorite in the previous 5 minutes having been  Chocolate  by  Snow Patrol  and  Scooby Snacks  by the Fun Loving Criminals . It's looking very indie,however very good; the most convincing, mature, and consistent record/album I've copied to date, and I've copied around 18 in my shotyear and a halfof illegal download. Half of which I've lost hereand there.   Thing are on the up as far asI canreckoned with. All it would take would be to discover some lovely youngstudy in southern France and fuck about with him. Well maybe that's pushing it, but yes, indeed, things are swell and swelling and smelling of VICTORY!!!  xBuBzx
