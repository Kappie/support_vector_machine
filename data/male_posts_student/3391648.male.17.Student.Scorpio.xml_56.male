Rally for Childcare and Paid Maternity Leave Women are saying that we want to decide when, if and how we have children. Without access to crucial supports like paid maternity leave, affordable childcare and an independent income, we don't have a real choice. All that Howard and the Labor Party offer is a narrow view of motherhood and a welfare scheme for mothers who stay home, with many strings attached. It's time to take action!   Let's put our plan: * free, quality 24-hour childcare * pay equity for all childcare workers * employer-funded paid maternity leave for all women * equal pay, equal employment opportunity and secure jobs for women * and more!   SATURDAY, 28 AUGUST, 12.00 NOON Treasury Place, Spring Street, Melbourne (outside Peter Costello's federal office) Endorsers (in progress): Australian Services Union, International Women's Day 2005 Collective, Radical Women, Socialist Alliance
