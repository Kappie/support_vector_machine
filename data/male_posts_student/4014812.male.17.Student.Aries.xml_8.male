Anyway this is the for the day of August 10th.  Well... i woke up and played Warcraft 3 and Counter-Strike for awhile. At like 1:30 me and dimitri left to go swimming for a while... so we went swimming... made some splash's... then went home.  Ate some food... played a little more CS and Wind Waker.  Then at around 7:30 we went swimming again. Made more splashs. Then went home... I played a little more Wind Waker... STUPID GAME.... cant find the freakin triforce crap. Anyway... i played that for a while and then i went to bed... watched wrestling for a while until i finally fell asleep.
