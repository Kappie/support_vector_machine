HAHAHAHAAH.. lol.. okie.. i'm goin crazy.. lol.. aniwae, let's update.. today, kinda bad day, cos i scolded Fang Fan til she cried.. and ma frens say that i'm losin it.. i jus wanna scream at them sayin, DUDES, WERE U GUYS PREFECTS BEFORE? IF U ARENT, GET THE F OUTTA MA FACE!!!! U GuYS SUCK AT SCOLDING! EVERYTHING ALSO SCARED!!! but, of course i didnt.. anyways, i scolded that *woman* cos she screamed, i think.. i was in 1e2 doin ma duty by keepin them quiet.. and they were quiet in a short while.. then i heard a LOUD, SCREECHY, FEMINIE scream.. and from then onwards, i knew who to relate the scream to... it's one of the 4 girls.. dun say that i'm bias. i know them. i even know how they the styles that they whine, scream and so on. dude, i think i can be their mum. anyways, i went into e3 and shushed them quiet.. more like shoutin at them to keep quiet. then i turned to the right corner of tha room and asked who scream. they didnt reply and i said that if the person didn't own up, i'm gonna relate to the 4 girls and they are goin to get it big time.. i know that it's unfair.. but then, it's the only way to get them to own up.. i know it sounds toopid to pursue into these kids of stuff... but the scream was sooo loud that i could hear it through the walls! imagine a teacher teachin, what would they do? back to the story.. we argued, me and fang, then we argued to the point that she gave up and decided to use tears to resort to resolve the matter.. DUDE, THAT OFFICIALLY GAYYYYY! i REPEAT. GAY. anyway, she cried and cried.. like i tortured her or sth.. anyways, i was not merciful.. then i dunno what happened, i think everyone started walkin then everyone started screamin.. i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO pissed, i shouted for them to SHUT UP. and they did. and i called those eho shouted to come out offa class and see me.. they were the chairman, vice chair and Jacob.. sigh.. didn't scold them.. jus talked to them.. even the chairman said that Fang fan was the one who screamed. sometimes, i think that Fang can join the actresses academy cos she can sct soooo well.. then kenneth, jason and terry came and asked us to go back ta class cos lessons were goin on and that if we dont, the teachers are goin to friggin hell nag.. we didnt really obey cos it was maths period.. but then, we had to go back.. dude, what choice do we have? lol..   yea.. headed back ta class.. and mrs low was jus gettin started on her SPEECH.. dude, she sucks.. anyway, she had this test thingy again.. for us la.. then we were like arguin dun wan la.. we wanna use the pass that we had won for the class of the term thingy.. to postpone the friggin testy.. then she started to reprimand us.. dude, do u know how long did she take? 2 WHOLE periods.. she was givin us a CRAP talk.. talkin abt how lazy we are, what must plan our future.. then blahÂ².. we were like so pissssssssed.. by the end of the first period of her talk, most of us had our heads on that table.. lol.. includin me.. and the most amazin thing happened.. shehana, me and the others slept.. as in SERIOUSLY! lol.. i slept for like 15 min's i think.. lol.. yea. the talk was thaaaaaaaaaaat booooooooooooring.. sigh.. then the bell rang at the end of her 2 periods and we were instantly awake!!! lol.. then art.. tOOOOOOOOPID heng.. i think he has some grudges against me.. asshole.. roy, sebas, marzuq, shehana and me were laughin over some pics on the newspaper.. it was not obscene pics, mind u.. jus a pic of the species pic, and then he gave us that tone [i'm-pissed-but-i'm-talkin-to-ya-in-a-nice-way] then said what.. blah blah blah.. okie.. we were makin noise and that we were in tha lib, but then, he could have jus told us to keep quiet instead of givin us mroe CRAP talk.. yea. WE WERE PISSED. AND WE STILL ARE. basket.. i was jus beginnin to like him as a teacher but then he has built up the hatred in me for him again.. ka ni na.. i hate him.. sigh.. i'm sooooooooo tried of entertainin the teachers.. speakin of entertainin, i have ta entertain ms shirley chua AGAIN! cos the fang fan complained to her abt me.. sucky.. in tha wrong but wont admit.. sigh.. this is like the second time that i'm facin her.. and the first time concerns the 4 gurls too.. sigh.. but too bad for them, the first round, i won. so for the second round tmr, BRING IT ON. i'll be waitin.
