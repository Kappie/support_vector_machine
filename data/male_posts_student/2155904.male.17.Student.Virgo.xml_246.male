Today's day included Tyke going to Children's Hospital where he felt like either a mutant, a retard, or just old. He was taller than almost every single person he saw in the hospital. That includes patients and staff. When he was there he went through a few check-ins and he noticed he got a couple odd glances from people wondering why he was there since he looked old enough to be bringing a kid of his own in. But nope, just Tyke himself.There were some coloring stations and some cartoons playing but Tyke decided to play with his phone instead. The actual appointment was a breeze. Tyke took off his shirt, got felt up, was asked if he was cold, said no, and then was told he was fine. So the diagnosis was that Tyke doesn't need to go back to see the doc again and that he really shouldn't have any problems with this thingy. His breastbone is just tilted on one side making for the odd appearance but really it isn't that odd. It just looks like his left pec is stronger. It isn't but it looks like it. After Tyke drove on home he did some mom-helping things and then proceeded to spend the rest of the day playing the piano, lifting weights, and washing the windows outside the rec-room for no apparent reason. But now they look good so that is a bonus. And then Tyke and Kinker got MSwa to help set up a game at Bondage's house. Interesting way that arose you could say. Kinker asked Tyke if he wanted to play poker and then they asked MSwa and then he called Bondage and then he said they could play at his house and then they said that was cool and then Tyke called Macaroon and then he said he'd play and then Tyke picked up Kinker and then they picked up Macaroon and then afterwards Tyke drove home Macaroon and Jew but not Kinker cuz he was off getting someone out of a ditch which really wasn't a ditch and then Tyke took home Macaroon and then he took home Jew and then he came home and then he...exhaled. Now it's just time to take it easy. Tyke has to get up at 10:30 tomorrow cuz he has his family coming over somewhat early and then apparently he has a party at night. But he started talking online to a really longtime friend of his which was really cool. And she's coming to his "party" Friday night. Just a graduation/send-off thing with family and family friends. And Saturday Tyke is also busy and at night he has to take care of his two cousins sorta since all the other adults will be gone. Oh yeah, Tyke just remembered he was gonna say that there were babies galore at Children's Hospital, like you would expect. Purdy would have been in heaven. But yeah, Tyke's weekend will be a little bit of a drag so hopefully it ends up being fun. Then next week Tyke has his orientation at WSU which will mean he finally gets his schedule and such. That will be nice to figure out. And then soon his laptop will come and that is also great. For now Tyke is going to focus on the now and the next to now.
