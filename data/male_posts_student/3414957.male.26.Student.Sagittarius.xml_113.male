If you want to say you like the color blue, don't go into a philibister about the history of the color pallette or why you hate all the other colors, just say you like the color blue. Jeesh!!!  Checkout   urlLink KFI AM640 online . You can listen to any of their radio shows live via their cool streaming program. I recommend catching  urlLink The Phil Hendrie Show  from 7:00pm til 10:00pm. Its hilarious!!!!  Man, I hate it when people want to tell you their life story when your trying to do something, or if they are just plain creepy!!!!
