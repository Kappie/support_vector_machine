There she met Pecan, the insanely smart supercool nut who is not just any nut, but a CHINESE nut (more speshal;)). Anywho, these two nuts, although quite different types of nuts became good friends. Then Peanut and Pecan started to spend more time with someone they knew for a while, Pistachio. Pistachio is a supercool weird kind of nut that everyone loves. So this nut trio always have fun and Pistachio Rocks!. Well that year came and went and a new year came upon us. Pecan met a dashingly handsome and supercool freshman nut, Almond. Pecan had such the hots for Almond she risked the Nuthouse Grapevine and her seniority status to like Almond (but thats another story). Peanut also had this friend named Cashew F. (there are 2 cashews in this story) who is also super cool. She too knows Almond and Pecan. Oh and did i mention Cashew F. is super cool? Well Cashew F. knows Cashew MK who secretly has a thing for Peanut, and although Peanut still does not returns his feelings, he still is a nice and sweet Cashew guy. Peanut also has another friend nut named Walnut. And even thought at times Walnut can be a meanie hes still a cool guy and will be missed once he graduates from the Nuthouse High School later on this year. Thats all for now folks, tune in next week for more tales of Peanut, Pecan, Pistachio, Almond. Cashew F, Cashew MK, and Walnut at the Nuthouse high school.  :)
