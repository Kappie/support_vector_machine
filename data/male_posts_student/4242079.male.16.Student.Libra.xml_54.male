Or that the clouds would part so quickly and unexpectedly....Some people just have that ability, to lift my spirits, to make me happy, to make the pain and depression and mild alcoholism not seem so bad.  I spend many hours talking to Crystal tonight. Not the Crystal you've come to expected to be mentioned on these pages, but a different one. To clear the confusion, This latter Crystal will be reffered to as Krystal with a K. I don't think I've smiled that much for a while. And I don't think I've seen someone smile that much because of things I've said for quite a while. Tomorrow, I get to see Crystal with a C. She will be at the show. So much has changed since I last need St. Tibs Day. I can spell Konfusion with a K.  More may follow in the morn, but I'm sure I'll be up before you all anyway...lazy bums!!!!
