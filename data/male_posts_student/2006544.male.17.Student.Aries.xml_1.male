It could even be considered some sort of latest fashion, a  "Retro trend" , if it just wasn't so stupid and so old-fashioned... People really think it is funny and  pop-cult  to insult and humble those who are different, and are even encouraged by others to do so. We actually got to the point of not caring about other people's choices, skincolor or religion (somewhere around the 80's, I am not sure, I wasn't here), but of course that for every two steps forward we   have to take   at least one back. You don't have to be part of a minority group to feel upset about that kind of reaction from people. And even if you're are not black, or an indian, or spanic, even if you are not gothic or hinduist, even if you're not gay or anything like that, you most certainly are different in some way. We are   all   equal, and (thanks, God) different in some way. That is what makes us so  unique , that is what makes relationships so interesting.  Hugs, from an ordinary different guy, just like you, GePeTo  Ps.: Just read  urlLink last Saturday's post . I has a LOT to do with this one. Ps2.(not PlayStation2, [geez, that's old]): Just because you like HipHop, it doesn't mean it's the best or the ONLY good society around, ok?
