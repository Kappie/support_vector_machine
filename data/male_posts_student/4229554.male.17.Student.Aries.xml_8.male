But I feel that most of my feelings are one-sided, but then again, I have yet to stretch out that hand to see if she grabs it back. But what is she doesn't, what if she gets uncomfortable, then where will we be? I will be one friend shorter in my already completely diminished line of friendships. I remember I had it all planned out, she would let crystal leave and on her return I would ask her to "come lay with me"...But then again, what if she laughs? SHe already doesn't feel that interested in the notes I give her, she seems maybe...well, I'm really not sure. I just wish I knew, or had the passionate drive to find out.
