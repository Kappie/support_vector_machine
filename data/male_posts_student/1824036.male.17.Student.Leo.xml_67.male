Perhaps that is the reason that I am not getting a whole lot of posting done. This week we have these little dress-up days where we can show our "school spirit".    Monday)  - Occupation Day - This was quite funny to see what people dressed up like. Drew, and Shamus dressed up in blow up costumes. Drew was a body builder and Shamus was a Sumo Wrestler.  Tuesday)  - Pajama Day - This has got to be every girls dream. They all wore pajamas and were all giddy the entire day. I still dont see why girls are girls...But what the frick...eh? Why should I know. They are confusing.  Wednesday)  - Retro Day - Quite a few nice costumes today. Nothing too special or anything. I liked Drew P. and Jacob H.'s the best.  Thursday)  - Idol Day - Much...almost exactly...like Occupation Day. Most people who went as someone in particular on Occupation Day, came as something to the same genre on Idol Day. We had Kiss in the house though! And Elmer even dressed like a chick! BRA AND ALL!!! Oh yeah, Shamus came as 2 Pac and painted the black skin tone on with some shoe polish. He will be brown for a while.  Friday)  - Blue and Gold Day - Woo...whooptie doo! Blue and gold (note that I said that in a sarcastic tone)  I didn't dress up one single day. Im not really that much into homecoming because it has the whole king and queen thing which is just one big popularity contest. Which just makes me re-organize my prejudices. I think how the popular people all act exactly the same, and yet they still manage to pick the stupidest people out of the bunch to be the king and queen. This year wasn't quite as bad as earlier years. We had Joe Gruhn and Amanda Ropte be our king and queen. But still its not like I care. I still hate "popular" people.  Usually you pick a really easy team to play on Homecoming right? Wrong! This year we chose Esterville. And normally they aren't too good. But this particular year, they are 3-0 coming into the game, and they even had votes to be in the top 10 for prep schools in Iowa. I hope we live to see another day.  It is also butt cold outside and I am going to be on the sidelines the entire time. I am already cold just sitting here, how will I possibly survive standing in 40 degree temp on the sidelines? I liked our last JV game. It was a little chilly, but I played the entire game, therefore I kept pretty warm.
