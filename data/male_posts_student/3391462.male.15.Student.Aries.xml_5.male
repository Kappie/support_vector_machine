The joy of the last period passes very quickly and the joy of of the ability to sleep in comes into affect. Even as the day goes by many just stay at home and they Instant Message their plans and procrastinate the making of plans until Friday, and by that time people have been made plans and then you and your computer TV and your "comfort zone" are the fun place to be. The movies that you rent and the DVDs that you see are all great. The ideal plan is to always have a person on call, the person you call always turn to. The friend! The weekend is your time to relax do what you want and then do homework when you feel like! Like I said before judging is the worst way to be caught in a sticky situation, I have learned from experience that there are ways to change the views people think of you. Try to listen, ignore the people that say bad things and talk to those that are interested in what you have to say
