I switched from chemistry to latin for next year.  Apparently I can't take chem unless I take algebra 2 at the same time.  I'm worried about latin, though.  It sounds like work, and I've already got a lot of that for AP.  I might still switch to etymology, but I don't know.  Latin seems interesting.  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
