Some simple proofs are located in the post from October 2nd.    [10/4.1]    A subset of countable sets is countable.    The conditions needed to demonstrate that a set is countable are as follows:  (1) there exists a surjection from Z +  -> the set, or (2) there exists an injection from the set -> Z + .  It is only necessary to satisfy (1) or (2), as (1)   (2)   the set is countable.  Now, let us consider a set called B, which is a subset of a countable set called A.  We know there exists an injective function  f  : A -> Z + ; thus, we need only show there also exists an injective function  g  : B -> A, and by proof  [10/2.1]  located below, the composite function (f o g) is injective.  Let us define g by the reflexive relation  g(x) = x .  Thus, for every  b  in B,  g(b) = b ; we can easily show that this is injective.  Since we know that B is contained in A, we can say that g(B) is also contained in A; thus,  (f o g) (B) -> Z +  is injective.  Thus, we can say that a subset of a countable set is countable.    [10/4.2]    Z +   Z +  is countably infinite.    In order to demonstrate that Z +   Z +  is countabily infinite, we need only construct an injection from Z +   Z +  -> Z + .  Thus, define f : Z +   Z +  -> Z +  by  f(x,y) = 2 x 3 y  .  Because  urlLink the fundamental theorem of arithmetic  states that any positive integer can be represented in exactly one way as a product of primes  urlLink [10/2.5] , we know that for each  x  and  y , there is a unique  f(x,y)  contained in Z + .  Thus,  f  is an injection and therefore Z +   Z +  is a countably infinite set.    [10/4.3]    Q +  is countably infinite.    We can prove this quite simply by noting that there is an injection from Q +  -> Z +   Z +  as follows:  Let  p / q  be any element of Q + , with  p  and  q  each contained in Z + , and  p  and  q   urlLink relatively prime .  Thus, we construct our function f : Q +  -> Z +   Z +  by  f(p,q) = p  q .  We know that  p  q  is contained in Z +   Z +  for all  p  and  q , thus f is an injection.  By  urlLink [10/4.2] , we know that there exists an injection from Z +   Z +  -> Z + , and from  urlLink [10/2.1] , we know that a composition function is injective if the members of the composition are injective.  Thus, let g : Z +   Z +  -> Z +  as an injection.  So,  (g o f)(p,q)  is an injection into Z + ; therefore, Q +  is countably infinite.    [10/4.4]    Let A be the set of all functions that map {0,1} -> Z + .  Is A a countable set?    Yes.  We can in fact define  f  : {0,1} -> Z +  by  f(x) = c n  + a , with  c ,  n , and  a  elements of Z + .  Thus, we can create the function  g  : Z +   Z +   Z +  -> Z +  by  g(c,n,a) = 2 c 3 n 5 a  .  By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we can say that this function is a bijection; thus, we can consider B to be the set of Z +   Z +   Z +  to be the set of coefficients in  f .  Since this is a finite cartesian product of countable sets, we know that the set B is countable, and since all coefficients of  f  are contained in B, we can create a bijection between A and B quite easily; thus, A is a countable set.    [10/4.5]    Let B be all subsets of Z +  with exactly 3-elements.  Argue whether or not B is coutnable.    Let there be an index of B, call it  n : thus, B n  is some subset of three elements of B.  Define the indexing function as follows:   f  : Z +   Z +   Z +  -> Z +  by  f(x,y,z) = 2 x 3 y 5 z  .  Thus, B f(x,y,z)  gives us the set B n  containing { x , y , z } in Z +   Z +   Z + .  B is therefore countable.
