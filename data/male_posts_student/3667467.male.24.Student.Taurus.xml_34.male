It starts by saying the author was upset a Florida judge allowed a Moslem woman to get her driver's license photo taken with only her eyes showing. Poor us, this is competely against our American ideals! Why, if this woman wants to be in OUR country, that's fine, but she should conform to OUR moral values and OUR way of life. This person, who may have left her country of origin to escape religious persecution, should assimilate with the culture she moved to, not impose her exclusive culture on those she meets here! That's just plain un-American! So have you ever been so infuriated by someone's comments you didn't know what to say first? I deleted the E-mail.
