Mandy got me a really nice ring, I love it! Jilly's was so good, lots of my best friends shown up (Adam, Chris, Donna and Gav) and I kicked all they asses at pool! Chris got me some Skittles... obviously the best present ever! On a more negative note... I broke up with Mandy today... for about 2 hours. It was so scary. I have been taking her for granted and it isn't good. It has to change, so it will. I realised today that if it doesn't I will totally lose her and the thought alone scares me. Well, she's asleep in MY bed right now so I better go keep her warm... xx
