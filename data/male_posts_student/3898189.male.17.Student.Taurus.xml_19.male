I had also told myself that I was going to clean my room but I have failed to do so thus far into today...Wait I think I said that Yesturday I was going to do it...OH WELL! I want to get me some new games because I have worn out all of mine...And I think I just worn out Spider Man.   Last night I was watching X Games... All it was was the Dirt BMX and free style Moto. They were cool. But I was kinda hoping that Ryan Nyquist was going  to win BMX ( I dunno many other BMX people folk.) I saw him win in 2003 and he seems really cool so that is who I was rooting for. But what ever...   ...I think that is all I have to really say for now...I havent really done much lately.
