You will also be aware of the recent publicity given in the national press to "Brood X", a massive infestation of cicadas which recurs only once every seventeen years, and which supposedly will fill the skies with a thick black curtain of buzzing insectoid monstrosities, and that while not strictly speaking locusts, Brood X's appearance 34 years ago was the inspiration for the Bob Dylan song "Day of the Locust".  Yesterday morning I was walking to the student union where I usually read when it occurred to me that I had yet to see any cicadas.  At first I was somewhat disappointed.  I began to toy with the idea of just lying to people from out of town, concocting a Biblical plague out of whole cloth.  Naturally I would see my first cicada within five minutes of having that thought.  Right now it seems as though the cicadas are limiting themselves to shadier, more arboreal areas, but there has been a marked increase in their numbers already since yesterday morning.  Although living cicadas are numerous, the two most prevalent cicada-related sights are these:  empty, transparent brownish molted exoskeletons sticking to trees;  and most commonly, the thick black patina of crushed cicada which lines most sidewalks that pass through forested areas on campus.  Ignoring for the moment that there are "forested areas" on "campus" in this backwater, this is astounding.  As a nonnative, I have no choice at this point but to begin to lend full credence to newspaper accounts, and I will be buying a dust mask forthwith.
