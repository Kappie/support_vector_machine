On more than one occasion he dismissed band members by telling them not to show up to rehersals or something like it won't be necessary for you to come to Dublin to record.  I wish I remembered this great Dylan quote about not admiring heroes.  It escapes me, but is perfect for this situation.  Codeine definately takes the edge off, and by that I mean that I wake up in the morning (who am I kidding...after-noon) do things for an hour and then fall back asleep for an hour or two cause I'm too tired.  I keep feeling my insides twist, shimmy and shake like there was a 50s Elvis concert going on in my pelvis.  Whatever is wrong, I want it fixed quick cause pain and being doped up ain't fun.  On the upside, it looks as though the heat (knock on wood) is going to stay away for the next week or so.  Plus I've rigged a sweet venalation system to keep things relatively cool.  The cock-a-roach kill kount is up to 3 and I found return to horror high at the local video store...Goodnight codeine is calling
