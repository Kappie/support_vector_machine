ADVANTAGES to home brew:  1. Always higher alcohol content. 2. Cheaper than the store. 3. Fun to tell friends that you made it yourself. 4. Every beer I've tried that was home brew was just as good or better than it's commercialy sold equal. 5. Brewing in your home is just cool.  DISADVANTAGES:  1. You have to buy the equipment. 2. You have to get the bottles which might be the hardest part of all. 3. If you mess up with the sugar or if a rouge strand of bacteria gets into the batch it could ruin it. 4. If you add to much sugar or the wrong kind to the beer it will explode! (it happened to me) 5. You need somwhere in your house to make it. 6. It takes at least a month before it's ready to drink and the red wine tastes better the longer it has aged  The beer and wine is just so much less expensive when you make it yourself. You pay I guess about $8.00 for a 6-pack of beer in the store but when you make it yourself you end up paying at the most $6.00 per 6-pack. As for wine, an acceptable wine at the store is at the least around $10-$15, if you make it yourself it comes out to be about $3.00 per 750 milileter bottle.  One good thing for those of you who like to get drunk, this stuff always has a higher alcohol content than what you buy in the store. One beer = one good buzz for me.  Here are all the beers I've made so far  West Coast Pale Ale - light colored beer, tastes like an import, almost same taste as a St.Pauley Girl. Old English Stout - dark, has almost a coffee taste Toutle River Tart - has a zing to it Framboise Weisenbeir - hint of rasberry in this one Ambiorix Red Ale - red just like the name, this is the one that exploded because I used the wrong kind of sugar as primer Hard Cider - apple juice beer, no carbination but very tasty.  My favorites are probly the West Coast Pale Ale and the Hard Cider.  Here are some of the wines:  Blackberry Merlot - very dark red wine, the blackberry taste comes though very well, smooth Merlot - very warm going down, also smooth Strawberry - Actually made this from scratch and it isnt quite done yet but im sure it will be good, it is a ruby color at the moment White Zynfindel - dry and best served cold.  In fact, I like all my wine chilled in the refrigerator but that's just me. ____  You can buy all of these beers and wines in a kit, just go on ebay or on google and search for "beer/wine kit" I find it cheaper to buy them off ebay because they go for cheaper than the manufacturer most of the time.  Soon I think I'm going to try and make a batch of wine out of grape coolaid, I hear it tastes very good. I'm also planning to make a batch of rice wine. Hopefully soon I can find a cheap distiller and experiment with making different types of hard liquors.
