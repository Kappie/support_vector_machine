Due to the fact that its loud it prevents me from sleeping. In fact last night after my last post I laid in bed and tossed and turned until 9am when I finally got out of bed. THIS THING IS DRIVING MY CRAZY! Now I cant go to sleep at all because we have a wedding to go to in about and hour. O well, hopefully we will leave right after the thing and not go to the reception. I really need some sleep. I hate not being able to sleep.   On to a new subject...For the past few weeks my internet in my room hasn't been working and we have tried and tried to figure out what was wrong with the damn thing! We bought a new Ethernet Card for it and took it to a computer place and nothing would seem to work...Well at 9 a computer guy from SBC came over (that's why I had to get up) and he told us that it was the damn portal. We would have never figured that shit out. We would still probably be looking for the damn thing if he hadn't come out. O well, the fact is the computer in my room is working now...and that makes me a happy person. :) Well, I got to go start to get ready for the stupid Wedding, catch yall later!
