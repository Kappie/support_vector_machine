I still remembered we met on the first monday of June 2000. then from tat day, i've tried to make this frenship last and even fallen for her but she rejected me for the first time. i didnt felt a thing though cos it wasnt serious at all. then from tat day onwards, we seldom went out, getting lesser every month. i really tried to treat her good but then.....she still said those hurtful things to me tat i am......poor. i was kinda dumb cos i don easily get mad so i dont mind at all but i remember wat she said.    after one yr, i have changed to a new college as i cant cope with the stupid calculations in the engineering course. 80% of the course requires u to remember a lot of formulas...duh. the new college is same as hers but in the different side of the building and i told her about it. she called me and suggest tat during my registration, she come along and told the admin that she is the one who intro me to this college(the one who introduce a new student will get $500). yeah, they tried to see if they can get the $500 for her. i was surprised that she is willing to follow me and returned all the money to me.    weeks have passed, and one day i asked about the money. she said the admin is processing and i suggest if they gave the money, i will give 40% to her. months have passed, i ask her again,......guess wat she said? she said she have already used all the $500 and asked me whether if it possible not to return it. i was shocked, how can a gal do this? after all, i tot wat she did is helping me but nope, she was just trying to get the money tat my mum was saving it so hard. wat can i do? ask her to return it? she wont. from tat day on, i tried to forget her......such a gal tat would used someones trust and money to get wat she wanted, MONEY!!     yeah.....i didnt find her for quite a long time after tat. i was having fun in the new college, new gal fren. there is only few though and i only knew two gals. both are quite pretty, friendly and sincere. it really wish i could tell them cos they have changed my life, from a shy guy to someone who dare to talk to a gal with eye contact! they were nice and talkative.......too talkative...even on the in the icq. between both of them, i am only close with prettiest one, lets call her K. she was nice, too nice to everyone till everyone misunderstood, so tats y so many guys in the college is after her. i didnt, i even tried to avoid her cos she was quite annoying n talking too much n always asked me to accompany her for lunch but i didnt. although we met nearly everyday, we only had lunch trice.    as time went by, we are getting closer, sit with each other in every class and chat on the icq every nite for few hours. then gradually, i have fallen for her but i never really tried to court her cos it is impossible bcos all her guys fren were more better than i do but i really treat her very good compare to others and she cares alot for me too and she even scold my frens for wat they did to me. from wat i can say is tat no one has ever treated me this nice, respect me for wat i am, accept me for wat i am although i was quite cool to her and till this day, she is the only one who has ever treated me this nice and respected me for wat i am.     but..........i've never appreciate her cos i cant. i really wish i can court her like the rest but we cant be together cos......i dunno...maybe i think too much. i try to find some small reasons to scold her, hurt her and avoid her but she still cares for me. it hurts but i have to do tat, i am a really selfish a**h***. i felt so bad that even today, when we met, i don even have the courage to look or talk to her at all. and btw, she got a bf, a good one and i'm really happy for her.    then......the starting point of a bad ending....tat gal called me back.....few days before the chinese new yr ends. we talked for an hour or less and she asked me to find her. we went out with my new classmates, all guys. continue.........
