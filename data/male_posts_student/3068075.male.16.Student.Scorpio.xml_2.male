Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. - Girl hugs him - Guy: Can you take my helmet off  put it on yourself? It's bugging me. - Girl does -  In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived.  The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him  felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.
