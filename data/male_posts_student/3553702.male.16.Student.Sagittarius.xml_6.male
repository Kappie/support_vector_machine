Name: Jordy Williams Age: 16 Sex: Male Stuff I do: I'm a writer, I do some fictional stuff and some poetry. I might post something here. I don't really practice enough, but I try. I also invest a LOT of my online time here: www.mysteryandmagic.com. I'll probably post some stuff about that  too, so if you plan on reading my blog, you might want to check that out. I also play guitar with my "band", Cross Fire. I'll probably post some stuff about that, but we can't really do much until our drummer BUYS A DRUM SET!!! But, that's another blog altogether. Other Details: I'm a soon to be Junior at my high school (its summer vacation right now) Purpose of this blog: I'll probably use this mostly just to get my own thoughts on paper (digital paper that is) Sometimes I'll talk about stuff that's going on, and sometimes I'll just rant about whatever I feel like ranting about...comments will ALWAYS be allowed and I'd love comments, so that I know SOMEONE is reading this stuff...
