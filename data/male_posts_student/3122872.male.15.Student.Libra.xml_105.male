Cousin got a set of one of those "My First Set of Culinary Tools" thingies, but I would like to point out that it might be better named "My First Set of Lethal Weaponry" or something to that effect,   First of all there was the rolling pin...   It  looked  like one of the flimsy plastic ones that the toy makers use thermoplastics to make, light, cheap, absurdly colourful, probably melts on hot days, debates on its non toxicity still raging... You know the sort of thing...   Well, it hurts when you're getting hit across the head with one...    repeatedly    Don't tell me anything " You're bigger, fend her off" etc etc,   YOU TRY IT WHEN SHE'S SITTING ON YOUR SHOULDERS   You drop her, you die, not to mention that I'm in no particular hurry to get a guilty conscience, I've lasted 15 years without one, I'd like to keep it that way...   You don't, you get beaten to death...   :/    Then there were the biscuit outline thingies, the ones you use to cut shapes out of dough...   Well these were metal...    and pretty frickin' sharp    And of course, I'm currently covered in outlines of goldfish, whales, butterflies...   Did I mention she bit me?   Getting her off the high chair, as usual, then suddenly    *crunch*    She bit through my t-shirt, leaving a little red semi-circle of teeth marks on my shoulder...   I suppose that's my punishment for letting her watch Kill Bill with me...   Argh... Need more Oreos...   Meh...
