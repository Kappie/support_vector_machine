We then went out into the park by my house and just sat on a bench till ten. There were several moments when we just kind of looked into each others eyes... it felt like we were going to kiss, but it never happened. I was luckily not drunk enough to not know what I was doing, so I didn't tell her or anything.  We got a taxi up to the party, and we were bought more drinks by family members, which made me a little bit more drunk. We just sat there with my sister Francesca, my friend Erin and my cousin Joe. It was fairly fun, and eventually we had to leave, so Gemma went off in her taxi and I got a sleepless night at home :(  She text me earlier to say she was spending the day with Jeremy, and I literally feel physically sick at the thought of them doing stuff. It's horrible. It's pathetic because I know it's never going to happen but I can't help it. I might write her a letter to explain how I feel.
