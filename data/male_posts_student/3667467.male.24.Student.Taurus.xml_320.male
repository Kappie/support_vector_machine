The guy wasn't convinced with my answer, and demanded a guarantee that he could return it if it ended up being for the wrong sex. A possible scenario:  Guy 1: I hope you like it. Guy 2: A baseball cap! Thanks!   Guy 2: It doesn't fit! This must be a WOMAN'S baseball cap! Guy 1: I'm sooooo embarrassed!  Also at the store, we sell unisex cigarettes, gum, newspapers, and 20 oz. bottles of Coke.
