In an effort to alleviate my boredom, I obtained a copy of John Wydham's  The Day of The Triffids  as well as about 10 other Science Fiction books, they  should  keep me occupied for the week, but after going through 3 in 36 hours I'm beginning to have doubts...  Anyway, if you should ever be in need of a good book, especially if its Science Fiction (note I didn't use Sci-Fi *shudders* evil term...) then Wydham will not disappoint...  As for The Day of The Triffids, here's a basic synopsis:  The main protagonist, Bill Masen wakes up on Wednesday 8th of May to find the hospital he's in deathly quiet, so he decides to take off the bandages around his eyes himself. The night before everyone in the world had gone out to witness a brilliant meteor shower display, but the green light had a strange effect on the eyes, the population had been blinded... If this wasn't enough, the mysterious plants known as triffids had flourished in the lack of human intervention, before, the strange carnivorous plants with the ability to move were just curiosities... now they were overrunning the country feasting on the vulnerable populace...  It's a rather disturbing book, more so in that it feels like it could be true...  and yes... I now have a phobia of shooting stars and green plants :P  Meh...
