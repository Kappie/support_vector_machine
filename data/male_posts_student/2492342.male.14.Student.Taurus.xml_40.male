I wrote a poem about aisha the other day. but i dont wanna post it. yeah.  THE SPAIN TRIP IS ONLY ONE WEEK!!!!!! i thought it was two, ALL of spring break, so i thought i couldnt go to mexico. but i might be able to visit omyra. but i shouldnt get my hopes up, or ill feel crappy when i cnt go.  ill have fun with melanie in spain though. i dont think kamryn likes me.  i dont have much else to say. brian boscoe. (thats a note for me)  alrighty....  Much love..  peace  ~alex  la vida es una mentira.
