It better describes my mind...  Hmm...anything interesting that happened today? I sauntered around Rosedale Mall with Liz and Shayl for a good 3-4 hours or so, and bought nothing except food at Subway. Then back at Liz's place we had a little fun with her digital camera (lol, nothing dirty).  Driver's ed was boring. I know how to parallel park already after years of observing my parents carefully. Damn permits.  Random thought: Kerry for President!  Here's a few good songs right now:  Dashboard Confessional: Vindicated Tears for Fears, covered by Gary Jules: Mad World Hoobastank: The Reason Coldplay: Amsterdam Yellowcard: Way Away Yellowcard: Ocean Avenue  Pretty much the whole Yellowcard cd rocks, and I still have yet to buy it...which I plan to do when I have money.  It's off to catch the rest of Conan!
