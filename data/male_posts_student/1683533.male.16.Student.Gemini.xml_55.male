I also saw SWAT with Mike recently...another great movie...tons of action...cept i got up 4 times to goto the bathroom...I am starting to drink alot more water ok?? and plus I got a huge friggen pop there....I got up once as soon as we sat down just to go before the movie started...twice during the movie...and then once at the end....but I didnt miss much the bathroom was close lol....but yea...it was a really good movie...I like the actor in it...forget his name...the dude with the big eyebrows...he was in the recruit and phone booth...those are also good movies....  Celebrated my grandma's b-day yesterday over here at my dad's...saw some relatives...played some pool...and when some of them asked how my band was doin, i didnt have to say, "oh...we are goin slow...not practicing much..." because we are doing stuff now!...and 2 of my uncles mentioned my chuck taylors....they liked them....very colorful lol....yea that party was fun...  well...I am gonna go...bye  "I guess this is growing up." -blink 182
