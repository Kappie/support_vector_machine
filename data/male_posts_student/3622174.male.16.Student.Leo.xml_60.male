Tonight on Blog of Bagel, you'll learn my favorite 10 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life.  Each episode has a full description.  I've seen every single episode, and I've narrowed my favorites down to 10, even though it was a difficult task.  Here are the Blog of Bagel Top 10 for Rocko's Modern Life:  10. Keeping Up With the Bigheads  Skid Marks This was like, the third episode that ever came on, and it's a good one.  In Keeping Up With the Bigheads, Ed Bighead threatens Rocko, saying that he'll call the house inspector to have Rocko's house demolished, if he does not take care of his yard.  Both the outside of his house and his yard are a mess.  So Rocko and Heffer work together on home improvements, and by the time the home inspector comes, Rocko's new, well kept lawn tears apart Ed's yard, and the home inspector takes the Bigheads house away.  In Skid Marks, Rocko's gas cap gets stolen by a squirrel, and Rocko must go through driving school again.  Some people hear me say continuously, "When I go to get my license, I hope I don't get the fat guy."  Well, I pulled that from Rocko, since Rocko is constantly reminded not to get the fat guy.  This was a hilarious episode, and one that will never be forgotten by me.  9. Trash-o-Madness "Garbage Day is a very dangerous day."  How could we ever forget that line.  That quote comes from the pilot episode of Rocko's Modern Life.  It was the first appearance of the vile, furocious Earl the Dog.  The garbage rats finally get their licenses back, and it's garbage day.  Rocko looks around to realize his house is full of garbage, and the truck is right up the street.  So, he scrambles, and Earl the dog tries to attack Rocko.  It all ends in Spunky ending up as a..Chinese food box?  Long story.  This one is classic.    8. Cruisin' This 30-minute episode aired on New Year's Day, 1995.  Rocko and Heffer drop Grandpa Heffer off at the cruise terminal, for his Old Timer's Cruise.  Rocko and Heffer get stuck on the ship when it departs, and it becomes a wild ride.  A group of ducks is inconveniently sitting in the middle of the ocean (imagine that), and Rocko goes to the Captain's Quarters, and turns the ship right into the Bermuda Triangle, turning Rocko and Heffer old, and all the old timers into young people.    7. Bye Bye Birdie You have to admit, Nickelodeon was very mature with this show.  Bye Bye Birdie is the season premiere of season 3, and it has Rocko babysitting Filburt's bird, Turdy, while Filburt is away.  But, Heffer accidentally sits on the bird and kills it.    6. Ed is Dead: A Thiller! This one was the second episode of the Halloween special.  Bev is accused of "killing" Ed, but Ed wasn't even dead.  Hey, that ryhmes.  This episode was rarely seen, but, when it was, it was one of the classics.  The final 5 will be done in the morning, since I'm too damn tired to keep going tonight.  So, check back tomorrow morning before bagel.tech begins, and you'll get the other half.
