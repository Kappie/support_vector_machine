So why is it that poetry is such a goddamn romantic form of expression? Especially bad poetry. The thing about poetry is that I could write a terrible poem and nobody would criticize it. "Wow, that's very ... genuine." What the crap does that mean, anyway? Someone needs to have the guts to say, "Wow, that really sucks." I mean, nobody really gets into poetry because they actually enjoy it. They write poetry to get laid.  It's like playing the guitar. What makes a guy with a guitar so irresistable to girls? It doesn't even matter if he can play it. As long as he sits around with it and strums it every once in a while, he's an artist. It's the same deal as poetry. Sure, you might start to enjoy playing once you've been learning for a while. But initially, you want to learn because you'll suddenly become sexy. Next thing you know, you've grown out your hair, started saying 'dude' a lot, and have taken up surfing. Maybe teenagers have less patience with prose because it's not immediate gratification. You have to, like, READ a lot. Poems are short: it's their chief charm and only redeeming aspect. Prose can ramble on for pages, like this kind of stuff. No, high schoolers like poetry because it doesn't have to make sense. Incoherent poetry is artistic; incoherent prose is irritating. We all know that teenagers (girls in particular) are infatuated with EMOTION, rather than REASON. That's why prose is less exciting, then. It makes sense. I suspect this is how people lose their minds. They allow their mind to wander too much, and then they try to make sense of things that have nothing to do with sense. This must be why more mathematicians lose their minds than poets. (Or because poets start off insane.) I really have no delusions about people actually reading this stuff. I wouldn't read it. That is, of course, why I write it. If anybody does, post a comment about how random and pointless this crap is.
