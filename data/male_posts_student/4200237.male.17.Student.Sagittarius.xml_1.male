The smallest most insignificant things just bother the hell out of you. and you just hate the world, you hate every thing about it, every person that comes near you you just wanna get away from them.  It just seems that i would rather die than put up with the shit.  Its not everyday that i feel like this but today was one of those days.  But I do have something to look forward too, school starts in 4 days.  I will actually get to see people again, people i cant stand and people i wish i was around more.  It has been an ok summer, but over all i think that i have been home way way way way too much. Not next summer, no way im movin out.  going off to college, i cant wait to get away from here. everything has become so bland. nothing new happens and my parents get on my nerves and when they get on mine i get on theirs so i think it would be better off for all of us if i went on my way. way way way way away.  Maybe i'll actually meet some interesting people there, where ever i go.  I am feeling a little bit better now. but not much.  It feels like every one is against me and i cant be myself without someone saying "Man that is stupid" I feel like that everytime i show my true self to anyone that i just get the door slammed in my face, and after a while my nose starts to hurt so i just keep the door locked up.  I am so ready for school to start, I think this is the first time in my history that i have been ready for school to start. I havent done anything but work this summer.  I went camping at Aaron's house i think twice and when i did that my dad was mad because i couldnt help him but damn it, when my brother was 17 he was out almost every single night and it was fine, but when i wanna go out one single night he flips out and stops talking to me for a couple of days, it pisses me off so bad.  thats why i cant wait to move away. i dont have to worry about pissing him off, cuz he know i wont be there.  I wanna do the things with him but he pisses me off, he gets mad at stupid stuff, and he has no patience what so ever and it makes me mad. i dont know i just can't wait till school starts so i can actually do something for once.  and to see some girls. man i have been girl deprived all summer practically and im about to go crazy.
