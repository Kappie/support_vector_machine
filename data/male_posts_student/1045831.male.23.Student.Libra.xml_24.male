I instead of having fun at the bar had a quiet night at home.  Watched Reign of Fire. Don't expect any acadamy awards for that flick. Then I ent downstairs to get some water and ran into a couple of my boys and we hung out and chatted a little.  Then I went back upstairs to escape the rediculous drunks.  Some of these kids were so hammered they kept calling me different names.  Ohh well I escaped back upstairs and to bed I went.  A very exciting night if I do say so myself..  ;-) Stay tuned for the next fun filled installment of the Life and Times of  Zeke-Man !!!
