[+] longtime washington redskins coach norv turner = new temporary solution to  urlLink raiders woes . [+] the upcoming  urlLink super bowl  = nothing more than a nice analgesic for the assortment of splitting migraines, sore muscles, and mental aches and sprains that we like to call school[+] barbara walters says goodbye (to  urlLink 20-20 ), but regis philbin makes a more than adequate replacement (to  urlLink who wants to be a millionaire ). as long as they don't run the show roughly 300 million times a week again. [+] " urlLink 34% of college freshmen  surveyed last fall say it's important to keep up with politics, continuing a three-year uptick that began just months after the Florida recount and weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks." it took 3 FRICKIN YEARS for that number to reach 34%? c'mon, during 1966 the percentage was 60%, although maybe we have the sexy vietnam war to blame/credit for that. i hate my generation. [+] hmm, arnold will try to convince 10% of UC-eligible students to switch tracks to community colleges next school year. in addition, future education spending increases (NOT the budget itself, mind you) will be slashed by $2 billion a year, spending for csu's and uc's will actually decrease (0.3% and 2.4%, respectively), and undergraduate fees will increase 10% (graduate fees a whopping 40%). before you castrate gov. schwarzenegger, however, first remember that (1) the  urlLink projected overall education budget  is still $46.7 billion, and (2) it's not his fault that californians spend  urlLink 3% of their income  on education (40th in the country).  [+] i always enjoy seeing people show off talents that you never knew about (like seeing a friend suddenly bust out crazy basketball skills out of nowhere), or talk intelligently and competently about a given subject (sports, politics, music, regulation snowman head sizes, whatever).
