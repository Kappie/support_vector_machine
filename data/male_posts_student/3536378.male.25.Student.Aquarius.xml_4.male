Speed does not kill people, carelessness does!  I am extremely safe!  And forget turning signals, I am going faster!  Even though I am in Colorado, California stops are preferred.  My Yields are safe!  I have to make evasive maneuvers in an out of lanes to avoid the slow ones!  I am very safe when doing this!  Regardless of how many times I have been down the same roads and exits, I will always wait to the last minute and jump in the lane!  Again, I am going faster!  I am cautious!  It is a must to honk my horn, flash my highs, raise my fist and finger when someone cuts me off.  I do not care if s/he had their blinker on and waved in the mirror.  I am going faster, and one car in my lane is slowing me down.  I never make mistakes when I drive, so if I abruptly end up in your lane, and you honk, of course I am going to honk back and cuss at you!  Finally, I would not hesitate to stop traffic if the road suddenly changes on me.  You should be paying attention to me in front of you anyway!
