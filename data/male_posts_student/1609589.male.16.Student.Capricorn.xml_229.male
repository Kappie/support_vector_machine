Shaunda gave me a card, and a couple people gave a spare dollar :-P  I've decided that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best movie ever. And not for the obvious reasons, either. Even though they are a big part of it.  Remember that first thing where Michael Palin just talked on and on about opression of the weak? It was after that scene that I decided.  If anybody has any party ideas or wants to help throw me one, please PLEASE give me a call. It would be better than any present to throw a kick ass party to remember for a long time.
