Friday, sweet Friday.....not really...time for some strainous skool team basketball training! Darn, mr. coach aka sir really showed us....till we tire out! suicide run...darn. when we practiced passing, my partner accidentally pass the ball to me using the wrong way..and..*bash*.... AARRRGHHHH *in my mind*. i severely injured my thumb again. last time in taekwondo sparring, my oppenent really cracked my thumb joint. now the basketball...pity me. i gotta bandage it till it gets more serious. my mom still wouldnt let me go for basketball tomorrow morning. but i'll still try to convince her..that's all. cheerio!
