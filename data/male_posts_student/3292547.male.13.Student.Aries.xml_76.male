The camp, ROBOTECH 2004, will allow participants to work in small teams to design, build, program and test their own autonomous robots using the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System. For students entering grades 5-8, the program is designed to build interest in engineering, science, technology and math, said camp director Ken Hunter.  Campers will have the opportunity to work with Tennessee Tech engineering professors as they learn about robot mechanics, robot sensors and programming. Tennessee Tech engineering students will serve as camp counselors. This summerâ€™s challenge will feature robots cleaning up a hazardous chemical spill. The robots will activate an alarm system, retrieve a chemical sample, deliver cleanup supplies and move chemical drums.  Campers will demonstrate their robots during a friendly competition on the final day of camp. Parents will be invited to attend the competition and awards ceremony. The fee for campers who stay overnight is $295, which includes all program materials, room and meals for three days, snacks, a camp T-shirt, camp photo and certificate. For day-campers, the fee is $245.  The full article can be found  urlLink here .
