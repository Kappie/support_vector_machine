Usually, she supported the idea. Is this one of the signs from them?  I only left with 1 paper to go. 1 Jargon Player. Java. I really hopefully about to pass. I woke up early, to pray Fajr. Lately, I think He is watching me. Cos, I can feel in my nevres.... I just wanna to pass all the subjects and get on to the next sessions, Insya-Allah.
