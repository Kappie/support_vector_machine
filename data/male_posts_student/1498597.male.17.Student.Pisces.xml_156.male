It's pretty late (or early, depends how you look at it) in the night (or mornin', depends on how you look at it) and I'm still up for no fuckin' reason!  So, since I was doin' nothin', I thought I'd blog, since I don't really have anythin' else to do.  Plus, bloggin' doesn't require much effort, does it?  Well, actually, that's a false misconception!  It's really hard to come up with topics to talk about on here.  It really sucks sometimes, and yer just like "Dammit!  I don't know what to blog about!" and all desire for writing a blog is lost.  Trust me, thats been the case many times with me.  I go on, all happy, and ready to blog.  Type in my username and password...yeah we're gettin' somewhere.  Then the  "Create New Post"  page pops up.  The little cursor in the empty text box blinks...and blinks...and blinks...just an utter annoyance...calling...mocking...teasing...It drives you into the dark recesses of insanity and then yer like "Ah screw this, I don't havta prove myself to you, you fuckin' cursor thing!"  Then the arrow, controlled by the mouse, which happens to be controlled by me, goes up to the top right-hand corner of the page and clicks angrily on the little "X" which closes the page and begins what I like to call  "idle time" , where I stare at the bright ass fuckin' compooter screen (yes, I am in the semi-darkness of our compooter room...oh slightly sexual...and unnerving) and wait for someone to rescue me from my own insanity.  Oh wow, I was reminded of that song that goes  "Wake me up inside (I can't wake up!) somethin' somethin' somethin'..."   I forget, cuz I don't really listen to that crap.  Hey, but this time its different!  I didn't go insane!  Hah!   J.R-1, Society-0 !  Suck a dick, bitch!  Right, recently I got in a spot with my  old man .  Not that this is uncommon, but it has been awhile, and I was rather enjoyin' it.  Whatever.  Anyway, it happened a few days ago, and it was my utmost intention to blog about it here...but I forgot what happened sorta...I know my dad did raise his voice...I talked back, provoking...he raised a vacuum threathingly as if he was goin' to dash my brains out with it...oh yeah, OK!  I guess he was mad at me cuz my room isn't exactly clean.  And he was mad cuz I sleep til like two in the afternoon or somethin'...as if that was a crime, really.  Oh yeah, and both my 'rents were mad at me cuz I stay up all night on the compooter and havin' phone sex (haha J/K) with my supposed girlfriend  Elyse .  Isn't that lovely?  Yeah, I got in trouble for it, and I've been caught over and over again.  Luckily, they aren't very good at enforcin' punishment, so I can consider myself lucky, can't I.  Well, enough about me, how about you guys!?  Hey, that  Operation: Revolution  really needs to get started!  Who the fucks in charge of this pla-oh...oops its me!  Damn my own laziness!  Right, I'll try guys, I really will!  I was also thinkin' of postin' lyrics for songs on the blog every now and then...A nice little treat you know?  Well thats it for now...More to come...!
