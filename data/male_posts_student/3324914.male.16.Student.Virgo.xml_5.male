I think I cried abit at the parts of the film where Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, or at least the CGI Spider-Man) is swinging between buildings (at the very end of the movie). That was a fantastic piece of amagination(/eye) candy.  Serious.... on this movie.... I have a loss of words. It was just beautiful.  Seven gold coins out of seven gold coins.  ____________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000
