Damn I'm sunburned like hell though, yesterday was the happiest day for me, and its still going, I don't know why, but it is. I had some cool dreams last night too. Don't ask what they're about but I'll remember because I usually do.                                So yeah, my life has been pretty much busy and full of shit but thats normal. I need a new computer man, maybe I'll get one whenever I get home or something, and I've got a headache like hell... I need to go eat breakfast so yeah, I'm cutting this one off right now. *poof*
