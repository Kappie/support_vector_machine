Oh well.....it was bound to happen sometime....and I really was starting to really hate my frames. Gettin' old I guess *Shrug* but I'm aiming for contacts and a new pair....since contacts can be a pain in the ass to put on. Other than that "saddening" event......well in way not really since I get that new pair of glasses I've been wanting....the rest of my day. Average, not out of the ordinary.....what else to say =P. Wake up, school, home, and whatever else. Hmm.......theory exam though tomorrow....FINALLY gr. 3's over...unless I totally bomb the exam tomorrow which I think won't be an option.......I hope lol. So studyin' for that right now while typing up this entry, and doing various other things like MSN, listenin' to music, and sitting in front of this compy typing up this.....entry.....  My day started around 730 once again, with me dragging myself outta bed reluctantly and then trudging down the steps from my 2nd floor to my 1st as I am anxious for my breakfast. Starving from well usual slumber hehe. So ate a meal of tofu, beef, and rice and downed it with a glass of milk *wonder what it all looks like mixed with gastric juices in my stomach =P* and then headed upstairs to brush teeth n' stuff, get dressed, then head out the door. Stupid single strap duffel bags seem to get heavier and heavier each day.......but they carry so much more crap which is good =P. Anyways...back to the subject. Headed out the door, Patrick then came and then we headed for school.  School started today with history class like any other day 1. History bein' pretty boring....post-war Canada really is lame....worse than 20's or 30's I think. Well basically we talked about cold war....yeah that was history. Pretty boring.  Civics class then....where me, Lindsay, Hammond and Dave finally finished our stupid civics assignment. And then......got my essay on JFK back. WHOO 19/20.....my civics mark is going up =P. And so far my day is going well. But all this would turn in a matter of seconds around lunch.....and math....  Lunchtime played some crap ass ball and also broke my glasses in the process. So that kinda sucked....and then I realized that playing ball w/out my glasses feels a lot different. The net looks blurry from the perimeter lol. After playing ball though..yeah.....well not really playing more of shooting around since I was kinda blind but meh.....still s'all good. Math class anyways....  And my day would go downhill a bit more...geting 68% on my stupid GrafEQ assignment. Apparently he thinks that I made up the equations.....though I just printed them off the project. OH well.....*shrug* I still have an 83 in math.....somehow managing to be 2nd highest mark in class lol. Didn't really do much...just work today.  Programming: Usual.  And after school went to UCC to play some ball with Jason. Grabbed some more pizza from the new Pizza Hut and then ate and walked simultaneously to the UCC. Getting there, we played some one on one, shot around, and then the full court games started so we had to shoot when they were on the other end of court. Hmm not much else.....ugh I still need to work on my shot. My driving is startin' to sorta come back though which is a good thing, but gotta guarantee those finishes. So did that for two hours, then headed home.  And my night went somethin' like this  -SC -Theory -SC again when I got home -Studyin' for theory  Anyways I'm out for the night...so yeah if you people can pray my theory exam goes well for me that'd be great =). Gotta sleep now though.....exam plus Toronto tomorrow hehe.  Later.
