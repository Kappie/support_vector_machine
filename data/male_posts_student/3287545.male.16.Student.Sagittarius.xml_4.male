So, my mother usually takes me to the Bowns house on a Thursday because she lives right outside the village and it takes ages to walk there to deliver her paper. But this time cause I apparently haven’t been talking to her today she refused to take me so I walked. It was on the way back I was thinking I might take a long cut through the fields, along the public footpath, it takes a whole lot longer, but that was the point, because the longer it takes me to get back home the more guilty my mum will feel. So, I walking back along some road, don’t actually know whats it’s called, and I thought perhaps when I go through the fields I’ll have a wank, I feel kinda horny. So I go down this other road, don’t know what it’s called either (!) and then up bakers lane as this is where the footpath starts. I go down the path and start to fiddle with me cock a little to get it hard, but nothing much was happening. I got round the corner of the bushes where pretty much no houses can see made sure no one was looking and put me hand down me trousers. I jerked it a ittle and It came to life! So, I’m standing the the middle of the field having a wank, I was finding my trousers quite restrictive so I unzipped and got me dick out and had a proper good wank. It literally lasted about 30 seconds, maybe a minute (time flies when your havin fun) and I came. Holding my cock end cosed I riped a leaf off this plant on the ground and wiped away the ‘produce’. I had to use two leaves. Then I poped it away still a bit cumy, but not to bad, zipped up and through the leaves in a ditch. Then I carried on walking with a pretty big smile on me face. So I’ve just got home and made myself something to eat, a microwavable cheese burger, there ok I guess, get a tad boring when you eat them all the time but my dad seems to buying less of them these days which takes the pressure off I guess. I saw a film a few weeks ago, Cruel Intensions it’s called. It really is very good, I’ve seen it before and I liked it then. So, basically the main character in it, pretty fit by the way, Sebastian keeps a journal thing and I thought I’d do the same, seems pretty cool. So, my names Jonathon William Carr, crap I know, and I’m 16 years old, I’m not going to do the whole Adrian Mole thing and say and a ¼ (which is actually how old I am now), guess I’ve said it now – does that all make sence? I live in a village called Tolleshunt Major, in Essex, UK. It’s pretty small as villages go, and small isn’t good for me. I like to have shops and stuff nearby, we have a pub though, and a postbox! I think when I’m older I would like to live in London, or somewhere, everything I need all in once place – around me. And, you know they say London’s the most gay excepting place in the UK, at least I think they do. So, I guess that’s another details you can know, I’m gay, and it’s pretty important to me now, cause I’m kinda going into this phase where I want everyone to know about it but I can’t tell anyone, which is pretty annoying. I think a few people may have already guessed, but I’m not 100%. God I can’t wait to tell someone. I rekon I kinda like a sterio typical gay guy, I have more girl friends than boy friends, although this is quite a recent thing. I’m quite stylish, I no what’s looks good and what looks shit unlike some idiots. Plus I like to dance around like a girl when ever I move. But, unlike the average gay guy I have a girlfriend. Which Is really annoying me cause It feels like I’m lying to myself. But maybe I’m not, after all I’m able to write down that I’m gay, ‘I’M GAY’ – see. I’m pretty cool with it, but about six months ago, I could never imagined myself having a gay lifestyle, especially not at this age. Ok, so, nowadays I hang out with the girls at lunch and in tutor and some lessons and I enjoy it, we have a laugh. Life hasn’t been all that great recently, things with Katie (girlfriend) aren’t great. We started going out with each other like six months ago, infact it was her who introduced me to her friends which in turn made me realise how cool it was to relate with women. Up till then I had all boy friends, not many though. I’m seen as kind of a geek at school, especially when I was younger, I used to act all posh and clever, when I wasn’t, I wish I hadn’t now, I wish, I’d been myself from day one. So, I kind of have this label of being the geek even now in year 11 when I’m so not. I’m still friends with the ‘lads’ – hate that term, there’s Lloyd, he’s been my best friend since I started in year seven, we didn’t go to the same primary school though. I’m getting to the stage though where I want to shake Lloyd off – nasty I know, and replace him with me girlfriends, you I can associate with much better. It really annoys me when in youth club at lunch Lloyd comes and sits with us ladies, which include me and Arron (he’s gay too but really tries to hide it), cause I don’t feel comfortable being all gay and soppy, with the women when there’s a bloke around. And that’s what happened today, he usually just lingers around but this time he sat down. He’s supposed to stand with the rest of the men by the pool table and do a masculine cheer everytime some gets the balls in the holes, and live us women to have a laugh. Although I do have slight suspicions that Lloyd might me gay as well. I don’t want him to be though, not sure why, I guess I want to be the only ‘unique’ one and not share. I love Arron though, he’s fabulous, very camp and I love that about him. He’s pretty good looking and would be very good looking had it not been the spots on his face. I occasionally fantasize about having a relationship with him, kissing, sucking generally touching naked bodies, that kinda thing, and who knows, perhaps I will one day, when were both out the closet. The other big love interest for me, and has been since I first saw him in that music lesson in year 7, is Dean Courderoy. He is BEAUTIFUL, absolutely gorgeous, every woman in my year must fancy the pants off him. He’s had girlfriends but I’m not entirely convinced he’s straight, he hangs around with the ladies just a little to much, wouldn’t it be great if he was gay? – don’t answer that, it would be. Ohhhh, the number of times I’ve wanked over him, must been more than 500. I think about him a lot and can’t help but stair in class. I’ll tell you though I was THE (emphasise the E sound) luckiest guy on the planet a few weeks ago. As part of my GCSE in PE (I would not have chosen it if we weren’t forced too) I’m doing personal survival, which involves jumping in a pool and swimming and stuff. But I probably won’t do that for my final grade though, cause I was sick both times I went, but that’s another story. So, I’m in the changing rooms with some of the best looking guys in our year, Dean, Justin, and Robin, do I need to say anymore. Dean I’ve just mentioned, he’s the love of my life, not entirely sure on sexuality. Justin, is gorgeous, better looking than Dean I rekon, but he hasn’t got that certain spark that Dean has, I’m almost defiantly sure he’s straight. Infact the only put of me that doubts that, is the part which wishes he was gay. Robin, is quite good looking, although, I’m not really a fan of the big, fluffy, skater-boy hear style, I think he’s straight, but sometimes little comments he makes leads me to think he’s bi. He’s pretty open-minded I think. So, I saw Justin almost naked, he wrapped himself in a towel, so did Dean. But, Dean was sitting down do I was a almost able to see up the towel as he pulled up his boxers (I like boxer shorts). I’ve only seen a couple of cocks in my lifetime which is pretty disappointing. That don’t include porn and stuff, I mean real life cocks. I saw Rob’s on the geo field trip, it was quite nice, looked quite large if I remember, although that might be me imagination! I’ve also seen Will’s a couple of times, on the French trip in year 8, like when his towel dropped, but it was no big deal, it was small, cute though. Apart from that, don’t think I’ve seen any other cock, nothing special anyway. Anyway this is supposed to be a jounal, not my lifes story. Today at school was pretty boring, Errr, I had ICT, where we loaded the PowerPoint presentation up on to the computers since I finished it off a few weeks ago, Lloyd seemed to like it, but I think I might have pissed them all off by adjusting all there bit’s so It looked half decent. Then I had business studies, didn’t really do much other than chat and mess around. The geography, I have a lot to say about geography so I think I’ll leave it for another day. Then science. On Thursdays we have science in the C block, which I don’t really like cause the tables are in twos, I sit with Lloyd. In most other rooms though the tables are in groups which I prefer (sitting with the ladies you see). I did crap on the science test, I think I roughly worked it out to be about 30% - shockingly shite. Final lesson of the day, was PE. Were doing this analysis thing this week, which meens all PE lessons (3) are practical. So I was playing Badmington, partnered with Lloyd, think we lost both games we played – I’m pretty crap at it, so is he. Think I’ll leave it there for today, bloody hell, I wrote a lot. Don’t be expecting that much everyday.
