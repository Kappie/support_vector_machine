Right now it's only in Swedish but I'll hopefully translate it soon.  Well I just gotta remember to update that site as much as I'm capable of. Especially now in the beginning so there will be something on it. Right now, it's very empty. Also gotta remember to use this .css-document on that site for my next version of it. (Now it's very Blue, but I don't know if it will be good with black =/)  And I'm glad that I at last have come up with a good name for the site. That's a very hard part, I think.
