I think that both Christmas and Easter have lost a lot of their focus, too - Christmas is more about Santa than Christ any more, and ditto for Easter and the Easter Bunny (now where did  that  come from?).  But Thanksgiving just seems to have retained the original intent Abe Lincoln had when he created it during the Civil War - it's simply a day when everyone can get together with family and friends and express their gratitude for what they have, whether it be physical gifts or relational bonds.  There isn't the distraction of getting things (like Christmas and Easter), there isn't any big hoopla concerning dressing up or decorating, it's just about the simple things in life and being grateful for them.  Gratefulness and appreciation are things we don't express very often in this society, so a day dedicated to it seems only fitting to help get our focus back on what it should be.  Oh, and there are a few things that have been pissing me off lately.  First and foremost among is people putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving - come on people, it's a freaking month until the holiday actually gets here!  This is just as bad as people putting out "Halloween decorations" (now that is just absurd as far as I'm concerned - pumpkins are ok, but come on...).  And stores putting out Christmas wares WAY before Christmas (I think I saw some with Christmas stuff out at the beginning of November); this kind of stuff just kills whatever "Christmas spirit" may exist and exposes the holiday for what it really is - a vast capitalist conspiracy speaking forcefully with the modern capitalist motto - "greed is good" (ok, so maybe that's a little extreme, but I think you get the point).  Ok, enough ranting...time for me to go get sleepy and watch football.  Oh yeah, and my family is comin over... :P
