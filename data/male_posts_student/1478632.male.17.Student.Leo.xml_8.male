Mr Hill does stuf to make him cool, and I'm not sure what that stuff is yet, because I've only had him as a teacher for one or two classes. Anyway. About 30 seconds after I typed the last sentence on my last post, my friend came in and told me that his mom was going to give us a ride instead of him going to get his car. Later, though we went to the store and came back to school to get working papers (hmmm maybe I should get those today...), and all of this was in his car!
