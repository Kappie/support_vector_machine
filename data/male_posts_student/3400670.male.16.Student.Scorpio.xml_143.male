I also think it is the students or people who aren't afraid to work hard usually find the most success in life.  Depending, of course, how you measure success.  The interview - I SWEATED and STAMMERED and probably STUTTERED a few times.  I was interviewed by 15 different people.  It was a little different.  We will see if I get called into for a second.    This morning on NPR they did a nice show on Alexander Hamilton...they played up on his illegitimacy and being an orphan.  There is a new biography out on the man.   Are we ready to review Jackson to Mckinnely?  I am drinking coffee and taking notes as we speak.  For those of you who are unable to attend the APUSH review - Good Luck on the English Test...See you Tuesday.  How did people do on the Multiple Choice section?  Clark
