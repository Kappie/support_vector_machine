I like to drink and all, but man... that was a lot of drinking. I didn't get home until like 5 AM. I woke up today relatively early, made some phone calls and then went to Walmart. I've been doing a lot of shopping for necessities. I got some stuff at Ames and Walmart... and I need even more stuff. I need more tupperware or bowls or something like that. I'm already using the 2, I have to store stuff. I'm annoyed because I lost my sunglasses at Walmart. They were a good nice pair too. Quite annoyed by that.   In other good news... I finally got to talk to Laine again. It's cool to catch with with a friend.  ***
