They're made from flash and are kinda funny (somewhat). The website is  urlLink www.blackmaze.com  go check it out. And also check out the nintendo DS and the Sony PSP. They're coming out sometime l8r and I bet they're gonna cost more than a nuclear bomb! Last I heard, PSP was gonna retail for abt 600 or 700 US... Nintendo DS, if i remember right, was gonna retail for about 2 or 3 hundred US bucks... You can check out more from  urlLink www.gamespot.com  and  urlLink www.gamespy.com  Whee, cant wait for both of em... So many upcoming titles and hardware... Bah, to hell with N-gage, it can wait but Halflife2 and star wars battlefront cant and did I mention Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory... I cant figure this out, im like so damn tired in the morning, but in the evening, I get less tired and become more energetic... Hmm... I would've put more pics but Im on a tight schedule, my tuition teacher coming in less than 5 minutes... Im finally have tuition!!! lol! I cant belive I just said that! Someone who actually likes tuition! Nah....
