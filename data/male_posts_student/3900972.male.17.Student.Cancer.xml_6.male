Its a pretty kewl jobs, working in this garden picking weeds an stuff like that. When suddenly she begins screaming and running. Apparently she picked out an other weed when about 20 fucking bumblebees came out off the hole it left. There was a nest under the ground. And the bees where protecting everything in it. This gave me a new mission in live. Kill bees!! Its pretty funny taking a shovel or an other garden tool stinking it in the nest push the ground a side and run away when 20 bees are coming out of the ground. This experience thought me that I Love Fucking up insects their lives. I also Killed allot of Sow-bugs( had to look it up :P) and Spiders that day so I had a good fucking time.    Later that day I re-converted an other thing that offcourse I already knew. I HATE YUPPIES!!!!! Because almost everyone at that theatre place was a goddamn art loving yuppie. You know the kind that only eat biological food and no meat offcourse. And hug threes, and fuck donkeys and yuppie stuff like that.  so I was thinking to myself I really wanna fuck these people lives up, and then it hit me. Bumblebees are yuppies!! And they should all die a horrible painful death.    Also saw Spider-man 2 yesterday. It Rocked!!
