Example: I've been sent on a wild goose chase today, running between the Dennison building, the Shapiro library, Angel Hall, Starbucks, and Dollar Bill in a dual quest for delivery and collection of needed goods (caffience-loaded drinks and evidence, the two forces that drive debaters like me). Some people who should have had the evidence didn't or weren't there or just sent it elsewhere. Any normal person would find this confusing (don't you?) and annoying. But I don't. Strange. You see, I think God has a twisted (as in weird or strange) sense of humor. I respect that and have learned to enjoy it, even...especially in trying times. Also, I ended up with a Viente Tazo Chai Frappe and I'd hunt any goose for that.  Forgot to mention yestday: finished  Lord of the Flies . If any book would make me a vegetarian, it is this one. The crude hedonistic hunts they went on sickened me. But I do not believe all meat hunting is bad. The protaganists of the story ate meat readily. As long as the focus is on the end (meat), and not on some sadistic drive to end life, then it is good. Also, I liked his portrayal of human nature. Very Calvinistic, and psychoanalytic as I realize now. I never noticed how relativly similar Freud's and Calvin's views were before.
