I am trying to think of a topic of the day without sparking to much wildfire. The "Topic o' the day" is stress. How do you guys deal with it when you have it? How do you help others deal with it? What causes stress in your guys lives? This is something that I am sure can not be changed into a debate. If it can and it is a civil debate then it is fine.   My day went by pretty fast, although at first it was slow. During TA I had to go change some IP Addresses for the school. It was so annoying. This is not that hard of a job but my predecessors could not get the hang of this. One of the numbers was off by one, which is enough to make the internet not work.   Web page design was even worse. We had no internet until like halfway through the period. The district had changed the web blocker programs to block just about every site imaginable. The only site I could get on was Google. They even blocked Yahoo. Stupid district people.   Lunch was lunch. My friend had crutches and Lenny took them and was messing around. Then I took them from Lenny and was riding my skateboard with them. It was quite enjoyable actually.   In U.S. History I was barely paying attention. I was writing a note and the teacher came by and asked me if I was doing my work. I said "No" and continued what I was doing. She doesn't actually mind. I am getting an "A+" in that class, she can't complain.   I went home, got Chris from Patty's and left for youth group at about 4:20. I talked with Dominique (the most awesome person alive) and set up for worship and stuff. End of the night rolls along, and here I am, sitting at the computer, typing things up.  That is all.
