Well this is because the bad service, at my point of view, that they give to their clients, i am one of them and i´m not very happy with the service...  I think that Gmail (from the great google) is the solution that we need from a long time, and the only thing is that it´s only disponible for some people but I want an account...  If someone of gmail is reading this please give an account at your mail...  If some of you have a very different opinion abou this , please tell me I´ll hear it...  Thats all for today...
