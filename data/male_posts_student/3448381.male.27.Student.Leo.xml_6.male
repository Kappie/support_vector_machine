It’s approximately 8:30 in the morning and while my work begins to pile up in my cube, the desire to delve into the stack seems rather irrelevant.  What does appeal me is throwing a wrinkle into the cycle, breaking the habit of sitting in my cube and pumping out tax files.    The last true attempt at creating a writer’s club focused around the meaning of happiness and success.  So why not pick up where we left off.  Sure, during those days, we managed to bring a sense of definition to the words but we are no longer within the confines of those definitions.  Thus, our new environments, roles, and experiences compel us to form new methods at analyzing the issues.    My recollection leads me to believe that our focus in the past revolved around coining the actual definition.  Although such a finding is necessary, other aspects of the quest merit our attention.  Since the need to break a habit brings me to the writing table, habits will be today’s consideration.    I often find myself engrossed within the habits of life.  I pick one aspect and bam! I’m in it till the finish.  I frequently receive jokes at work for the time spent working.  I usually get, “Man, you’re like a machine!”  Usually, the only force stopping me while I’m consumed is realizing the loss of contact with the outside world and the discomfort brought along with it.  I like to think that we are all somehow connected and where I spend too much time alone I feel disconnected.  Once realizing this disconnect ness, the next step in my process is to find ways to crack the shell, break the habit.  It may take months before I embark on this next step, which may entail picking up a new book, perhaps writing a bit, or taking a long walk or drive.  It may even occur while lying in bed staring at the ceiling.   As was the case last night while my wife lay peacefully asleep, I drifted off.  During these exercises, the mind begins to wander giving moments that free me from the boundaries of life’s routine.   I find myself purposefully (but often unknowingly) getting lost, loosing myself not because of purpose, in search of anything, but more so to see where the thought may lead, letting the imagination run loose.    Through asking certain questions during these episodes of wandering, I often stumble across certain details revolving our existence.  One of which is that if habits are directly correlated with success/happiness, than shouldn’t behavior, as habit’s instrument, influence our degree of success/happiness?  Behavior results from two components: the way we think and how we experience.  By experience, I mean how we allow our senses to dictate our experience.  On the surface, it seems the two are on opposing ends of the spectrum.  How can you truly experience if your mind is rapped in thought?  Reason and thought are linear where as experience is circular.  When you reason, you begin at a certain point and through a process end at another.  As with your IT genius, reasoning leads you in search of the “On” button.  When the senses guide, as often was the case on my travels through Europe, you may end up right where you started.  While I dance, especially during a performance, most of the fun comes from not thinking about the routine but by feeling the music.  But how can you get to the point of being able to feel the music without first having an understanding of the routine, thinking through the various steps it involves?  There must be a balance between the two.  Can we experience without negating our innate ability to reason, that which separates us from all other species?  How can I still ask the questions; search for truth yet accept that there are no answers and if found, only through spiritual forms, which rely on faith in what we’ve experienced.  I can say life is a cycle but just as easily say that it is linear.  The truth is the truth, regardless of how interpreted.  Then again, is truth multidimensional; giving form in two or more contradictory statements?  On the other hand, are we the ones making the one truth into a two-headed monster?  How can we view experience objectively when in the end it is subjective?  We receive joy from realizing a presumed truth while also simply experiencing a moment.  Can we really ignore the natural ability to reason, to think, to engross ourselves in thought?  What keeps me dancing is the joy felt on the dance floor, where thought has no place, where thought diminishes the joy, the formation of it and the eminence of it.  Yet what keeps me at work is the thought process involved in deciphering shoddy accounting records.  Equally, using my “problem solving skills” to fill out a tax form is what makes me unhappy at work.  This may not be far from your frustration of having to deal with switching the “On” button when you rather be in Virginia.
