Due to the illness the rockstar drinking has been curtailed, and i am reduced to watching PBS, knitting(anyone want a homespun handknit wool hat in gray and white....very nice, very soft, maybe i'll keep it) reading and going to sleep at 10:00 which is very odd for me. I am also regretting last sunday's drunken e-mail to damien, which is much worse than drunk dialing as now there is a record, and the only reason i e-mailed was that i was all drunk and maudlin and lonely. While i do miss him at times there is no way in hell (which i am happy to say the  urlLink Hitch  will be joining me in at some future date) I would want anything to re-start between us.  Grrrr I will reiterate. Boys are dumb.
