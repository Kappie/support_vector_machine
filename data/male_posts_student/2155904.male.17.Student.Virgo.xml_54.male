A different crew came over to ring in the new year.  Amed, Tyronius, and K-Caj made it over.  They played a little PS2 before ringing in the end of 2003 with a music video to Fuck Her Gently.  Following that they did the first episode of the Tyke Turner Show/Macaroon McGee Roast.  Then K-Caj left and the three remaining made more videos.  They did a music video to What is Love for Amed and then they did one last show.  Talking Sex with Amed Annoying.  What a show this was.  With live call-ins and the Sex Toys of the Day, this episode will surely be long remembered.  These videos are priceless.  Ya'll gots ta watch them cuz they should make you laugh your 'nutcranker' off.  Going into the night Tyke was not looking forward to it but it turned into a blast of a night.  However it is after 3 AM and Tyke already is a little short of sleep so he is gonna try and get some now.  Love to the people I love.  Like to the people I like.  Indifference towards those I don't know.
