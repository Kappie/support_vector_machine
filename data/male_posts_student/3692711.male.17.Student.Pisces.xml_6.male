Haha, dunno for what reason, all my roommates and I are like very sleepy though we have an early nite yesterday. We plodded our way up to the roof for breakfast. Everyone is like " Hey, why look so dead ?" "Hehe, on the roof top of the City Inn Park" urlLink     urlLink     Today, we have toast bread with butter, a suasage and an egg for breakfast. While, back in Singapore I dont usually eat breakfast, so it's kinda "sumptous" to me. With a cup of black coffee... woah, the black coffee sure waken me up!! After that, we get changed and head to the airport for a flight to Sandakan.  Haha, in the plane, it's really very short loh. Go up, and have a drink and come down already. However, we get to see Mt. Kinabalu in the airplane ^^. Upon reachinng there, we are splitted into 2 groups after we have moved all our laugages up into the vehicle. Then we start to go to Sepilok Jungle Resort (of coz in Sepilok). Haha, on the way, we have lots of fun and i get to know that there are lotta lamers in the team! Wow, im looking frward to their lame jokes! "Mt. Kinabalu...woah!" urlLink     urlLink     Well, upon reaching, we are like " Hmmm.... not that bad afterall ." as the dinning place or the cafe of the resort is quite nice la. However, when we reach the place where we are going to stay, I am like...  "..okae... at least better than pitching a tent.. ". It is just like a hall like that. As soon as we have settled down and done with the logistics, we started to gather water and mop the floor. Well, we do it in a very innovative manner, we have a mopping race! Haha, cant imagine..., it is fun though.  After that, we get to bath! Haha, I have been looking forward to it cos we will be using that place to bathe for the rest of the expedition. For both male and female, there are 2 rooms, one toilet and one bathing/washing area. However, the bathing/washing area is infested with mosquitoes, so, bo bian, have to bathe in the toilet instead. The toilet... *ahem* okie... quite clean... well, we have to bathe as fast but ironically, we only have a pail and a scoop and the water is like filling up so slowly... But nevermind, we still managed to bath and wash our clothes in the end. Oh ya, the toilet is also filled with mosquitoes... and one thing about the toilet is that IF someone turn on the tap in the first cubical, the rest of the taps in the toilet will have no water.. kaka... Well, Im well-trained in NPCC in my sec sch, so i get to bathe faster and my friends are like " Woah, did u really bathe ?" these kind of reactions. Heex!   After that, we are splitted into grps (L1, 2 and 3) to come out with our team ground rules, motto and mission. Haha, we have fun doing that though. And this reminds me of the "Internet" joke. Cos' Clarence has brought mosquitoe net, and his grp members use it to cover themselves. Then Raven, " Wow, 'In The Net' (Internet, sound like)"  and we burst out laughing hard.  Haha, due to our efficiency, we finish the dae damn fast. Once again, the teachers praise us for being very efficient. And i cam to realised that,  if a team work as a team, then it will be efficient .  Todae, it's kinda holidae mood though! Haha, but it is very fun! And today is when we have our nite sharing on this trip so far.. The embience is damn nice, imagine without lights, everywhere is very dark, there's only candle lights... wow... Well, todae, i really enjoy myselfbut really tiring. And I hope to get more friends ^^ or else i will forever stick with Wanchoo and Eugene... haha
