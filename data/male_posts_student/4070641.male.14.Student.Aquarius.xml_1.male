What purpose does this blog serve? Well, (note to self: find new words to start sentences with) it really has no purpose other than to serve as a place for me to write about, well, me. Chances are that if you're reading this then you already know me (or so you think ¬_¬), so you'll probably know who all the "characters", as I like to call them, are. So that saves me the job of explaining. So, in brief, if you want to learn about what goes on in my life, and quite possibly what goes on in my manic hyperactive mind, then this is the place for you! And if you have stumbled in here by accident and are wondering who the hell this moron is, here's a little bit about myself;  Name: James Anthony Bolt (Jams to my friends[andpretty mucheveryone else])  D.O.B.: 29th January 1990  Height: 5'11"  Weight:9 stone  Shoe size: 10  Interests: Music, computers, videogames, Discworld, middle earth, music s'more, guitar, music, and oh yes, pies.  Likes: My jeans baggy, my hair long, my pies hot, and my guitar loud.  Dislikes: Fascism, racism, townies, chavs, pikies, trendies, gyppos, the government, noobs, obnoxious people, hypocrites, Joe Davidson.  Favourite bands: Muse, Radiohead, The Clash, The Flaming Lips, The Coral, Stereophonics, The Misfits, Jesse James, The Cure, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Led Zeppelin, REM, Steve Burns,The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Verve, Travis, Blur.   Well (argh! There it is again!), I think that should satisfy any lurking stalkers (yes Kevin, I'm talking to  you ). Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play SOCOM II. Until the next update, tata. Now go home!   Jams
