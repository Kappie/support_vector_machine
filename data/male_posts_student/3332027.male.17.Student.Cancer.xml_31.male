This is what I came up with:   Heart's Exit (remix)   To feel the numbness in my heart, To feel the darkness from within, To release the love that was inside, To remove what was once To feel the hardening that I call for My love be gone and this suffering no more No longer the one to love again No longer the one to hope and then To forget my heart and leave it unturned Is to give me peace and be unburned To banish what I thought I'd find To banish you from my mind I banish you so maybe I'll find my way back to me   *i PraY that iT fiNds a PurPosE"
