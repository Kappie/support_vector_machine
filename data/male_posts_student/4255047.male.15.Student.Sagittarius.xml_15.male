But they've jumped on the popular micheal moore band wagon. "im left wing" they say. "Im socialist" "swann (who is me) are you a facist oh yeah you a facist, your a nazi, communist facist dictator" I mean i dont even have a clue what that means. A rich religious indepentent school sitting on the Sydney Harbour bank breeds stupidity, people like this shouldn't be given the chance for education. idiocy and ignorance they display everyday biols my blood like a well tuned skillet. Racism, homophobia and religion its all there. If only someone thought about religion and god, actually thought about it, challenged the actual existence of a concept shoved down their throught since the've existed. I hate people.
