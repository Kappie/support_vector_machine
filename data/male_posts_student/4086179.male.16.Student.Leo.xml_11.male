Tom's talk was great, funny, very interesting and very cleverly raised some issues about God and what he has done for us. good stuff tom. but of course he was led by God at cafe church to say what he said. God is good.  second. all of you are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gullable. hehehe, well it cost me $5 but it was worth it. even if it was just to see the look on Nats face the 5 times that i had to tell her to get it through her head that me and gemma were never actually going out. fun fun fun. even you anika, yeah you might be thinking that your not gullable, but for you to work it out, pete hayes had to tell you, and he was in on the whole thing.... k.  LET IT RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAN THIS HURT! i never thought that they would initiate me to begin with. but when i think about it, and how it happened, i am not really that surprised. like i mentioned in a previous blog, i shuved a cracker down Jamie's pants, so he gave me a right ol' slap. deserved it, hehehe, well at least i can admit it. the only problem with all of this though, is that scott then followed up with one that brought the whole house down. he was right next to me and he just cracked me. this was so bad, i almost bloody well PASSED OUT!!! but scott got what was coming to him. the guys said that i now got a free shot, but i didnt want to take it. dave lovel and jamie pinned scott. the really interesting hting that jamie did though was that he grabbed scott by the knee and made him spread his legs. but since i didnt want to take the free shot, jeremy did it for me...  from behind... uppercut with the arm. hit him so hard that scott rose with the shot. ouch.  well this is the intersting story behind cafe church... cu all soon. bye. oh and beth... i that pinch i gave you... you had it coming. the only reason i did it was because gemma didnt.
