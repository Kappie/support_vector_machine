I ended up asking Mme DeRobert, toward whom I had been leaning.  MCAS today, I aced it, writing about how Winston Smith from "1984" was heroic and stuff.  Mostly it was just a summary of the book, but I still think I'll get a good score.  Sarah Blanks' SparkNotes idea helped a lot.  Oh, and there was one late person to our room, Madi Abromowitz, and I was all like, ooooo, stop being late, lateface.  I really need to stop copying Loren.  On another note, I'm beginning not to hate my Myth, Folk Tale, and Science Fiction class as much as I used to.  It's a combination of the students, the discussion, and the argument (I love class argument).  Some people make really great (anti-teacher) points and I can back them up, and then other people make logical-sounding but wrong points and I can shoot them down.
