Man... today was freaking boring. Fucking Netflix screwing me over on movies this weekend. I was supposed to get a movie Friday and one Saturday... but no! Bastards!  I think I'm gonna integrate some popular culture into my paper on suburbs. Such as an episode of  The X-Files ,  Suburban Commando , and  The Burbs . Well I dunno about Suburban Commando, but the title of the X-Files episode "Arcadia" says it all.  16 days until  Millencolin .  **
