Not for any special reason other than just his having to go for a full day as he thoroughly enjoyed his Wednesday schedule as should every student in the WORLD!!!  Classes were pretty anti-social for the most part.  In english the teacher was keeping a watchful eye on the populace, keeping Tyke from venturing out into the world of Hangman, etc.  He actually payed (shiiiit, Tyke feels stupid for he doesn't know which version of paid/payed to use here...stupid Tyke, leave a comment to tell him what it is, oh wait he has it right now he thinks) attention in class.  He almost got involved with the conversation but he didn't want to have to stump Purdy with his super-hard question and make her look foolish in front of her peers so he just let it slide.  Don't forget that he was lying there.  Tyke isn't involved enough with any english work to actually think of a hard question.  So he just lied there to make friends.  Like he always does.  He lies a lot.  And is not joking when he says he's joking.  Well, sometimes.  When he says he hates Macaroon and that he is totally retarded he is joking.  When he just says that Macaroon is a dumbass, that is the truth.  But he still loves that kid.  Just joking (or was he?!?!?!?!  oh man that was a great setup!).  Tyke's lunch crew had two great events happen on their trip.  The first one was not a great event, but it was a discussion that will create great consequences.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, Amed, and Kinker all made a joint decision to set the time of departure on a normal school day for lunch at 11:40.  That gives 3 minutes to get out from class to Tyke's car.  Kinker does it with ease, so why can't Macaroon?  Well, he walks slow and has a really weird face when he is walking.  He slows up the entire procedure and could be the reason for Tyke's group not making it back to school with ease.  But the real event of lunch came after the crew left JIB.  At JIB they saw this Oldsmobile Silhouette have a hell of a time getting around.  It went through the drive-thru on two separate occasions and then when they left it was just sitting idled in a parking stall not doing anything.  Odd really.  But after that Tyke went to go take Newport Way (road parallel to Ted Meyer's) and what did he find?  Well a cop car was parked in the street with cones sitting out notifying the general public that the street was closed.  Oh and before Tyke forgets, this story was really poorly told to Purdy so she didn't find it interesting but it really was interesting.  She did do a great job of playing along though after Tyke made a big deal out of it.  She was a real trooper.  But anyway, Tyke was in the left turn lane and knew he had to get over.  Well, the first two bitches wouldn't let Tyke over so he cut over after that car and went straight through the light.  He then pulled off to the gravel shoulder and readied himself for one hell of a u-turn.  Amed, from the back seat, was heard to snidely remark that there was no chance of Tyke making the turn.  Actually he said something along the lines of Tyke needing to back the car up and wouldn't be able to just U it.  Man was he wrong as the vivacious and vigorous Volv made the turn with plenty of room to spare.  Tyke just flipped that bitch and rode it to new levels, of turning capacity.  He then got back on Gilman and drove for a little way dodging and weaving.  Oh yeah, another thing, Tyke was trying to beat the clock and get back before the first bell rang while doing this so there was a time crunch although really nobody had to be back on time.  But anyway, Tyke saw a red light appear.  He didn't panic, instead he coyly pulled into the Jay Berry's parking lot and paralleled the main road while going 30 in a very tight and narrow parking lot.  He found himself in a tight spot, literally, but maneuvered the Volv past a postal truck and kept on going.  He went through a stop sign and paralleled Front Street driving towards the school.  He saw an ambulance on his right as he attempted to get back onto Front and was fearful for a second that he would be in trouble with that sucka needing to get by.  But he didn't so he was clear.  But then this little whore of a girl and her mother needed to cross the goddamn street so he had to actually brake for them.  Then he was so incredibly amiable as to let this psycho cross the street too, even though he could have been committing an egregious error of trying to do so when seeing Tyke's Man-beast rumble down the trodden path at 40 mph right at his skinny little ass.  But Tyke let the fruit cross and continued his commando-style return from lunch.  Right by the library Tyke saw a 100 year old woman trying to back her wide ass up and get her tank onto the 2 lane road but Tyke would have nothing of it.  He sped up and swerved around her while still avoiding the other lane of traffic and maintaining perfect balance and civility inside the motor vehicle.  This meant that he could proceed through the fiery intersection and continue on his nearly completed journey back to school.  He pulled by the school and drove right through another stop sign while then hitting a perfect right turn and made his arrival at the school.  The car, and occupants, made it back to the hell hole with a few minutes before the second bell and Tyke and Macaroon made it to class with plenty of time thanks to the sagacious steering of Tyke Turner.  Oh yeah, and Macaroon wasn't wearing a seat belt.  So he could been pulled over for that.  Not to mention his at least 10 other illegal moves.  Driving is fun by the way.  And he gets to take the A-VA-LON tomorrow as Amed would say.  What a day it will be.  He even gets a free lunch at Pie cuz of his pie card being FULL!  Wow, Tyke is awesome.  You think you know, but you have no idea.  You think you have an idea, but you are in the wrong state.  You think you are in the right state but...damnit.
