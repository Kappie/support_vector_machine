But I was stuck inside the GC working the tills...so naturally I was being boiled half to death. *Urk* Of course it started raining later but thats not really the point. As its always raining here.  I seem to be suffering from something I like to call "Who the hell are you? Syndrome". Basically, its when you meet people who know you, but you can't figure out who the hell they are. Very annoying. Happened twice today, once with a customer and once with a co-worker. Neither of which I've been able to put a name to yet. Bah. It would be like  "Hey Ben, can I borrow that pricebook?" "Yeah ok...hey waitaminute..."  And suddenly I don't have a clue wtf I'm doing. Arrrgghh.  Two great quotes I picked up from work today: 1. Some random customer said: "Mint flavoured tennis balls!" 2. Something random on a bit of packaging: "Varieties may vary"  I mean, in both cases, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING???!!!  Oh well. Time for coursework.  GO DEVILS
