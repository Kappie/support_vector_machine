Feel free to take these, this post is public domain.  The Pissed Off Toilet Seats Bloobywhore Razorweed's Vial of Death The Popped Top Grasshopper's Drink Cards of Loving Hate Crappy Fluid Dr. Cebvil Extension Cord Madness Mail Woman Plastic Rap Cee Dee The Raving Mad Truck Tires Age of Dirt Slack Jawed Spark Plugs Ba Overheated Ice Cubes The Loud Pacifist Crazy Mr. Iraqi Dictator Grant Has Large Goolies and a Large Thang Tin Cans of Rock Candle Wick Over Assortment of Papers Bob's Band of Flying Death Angels that Kill everything and Show No Mercy Seattle  I bet in 10 years all of those will be rock bands that I won't get any royalties from because I let this post be public domain.
