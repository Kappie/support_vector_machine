I am glad that I can finally sleep in tomorrow if I can avoid being woke up by someone in my family, it was because of them I didn't get to sleep in Saturday.        Anywho, school starts back on the 10th for me and I really don't want it to. Another thing is I refuse to buy a senior jersey because I am not about to pay 50 dollars for something I will only wear once. They are grey baseball jerseys instead of the traditional football jerseys, normally I would be o.k. with a baseball jersey but these things are UGLY! And I will not buy one from them.        I am hoping to get a digital camera before football season and create a blog with maybe a few others and have it be about the life of a band geek, haha.        Anyway, I g2g, Peace!
