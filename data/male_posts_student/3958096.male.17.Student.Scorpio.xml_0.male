No, I am afraid of my coworkers because of their sheer incompetence. You're probably thinking that, since I'm in high school, my summer job would be something along the lines of "bun toaster" at McDonald's. Insuch a setting, my teenagepeer working the fryerwouldprobably be less than bright, this is true. However, I work at MCVI. I went into this job under several assumptions: 1) I would be working with mature adults 2) Said adults would be well-educated, as they are dealing with important clerical matters 3) I would gain medical experience, as the facility is the leading cardiac diagnostic center in the area.  All of these assumptions were, sadly, incorrect. Although I am technically working with adults, most of them are far from what I would call "mature" role models. Many spend the time they should be feigning work (let's face it, even I don't actually work all the time) droning on and on about pure, meaningless crap. Others, I can't possibly fathom why a respectable company would employ them. I was speaking with another guy (we're practically an extinct species in the medical record dept.) in the lunchroom last week, when he entered into a speech about his inaptitude in high school and how he'd rather be pouring concrete for a living. O.K. . . . Another lady, bless her heart -she tries so hard to do her job right but constantly makes mistakes, leaving the rest of us to clean them up. I can't bring myself to be angry with her, though. It washard enough to teachthe poorold lady how to use the computers. Berating her for doing a poor job would just be wrong.  Working at MCVI hasn't been all bad, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that it has. There are a few genuinely nice, interesting people there. Beth Kawiecki has helped out a lot - she drops in every once in a while to make sure that I haven't killed myself out of agonizing boredom . . .or maybe her reasons are less morbid, dunno. There is also a pretty cool doctor who runs the pulmonary testing lab downstairs.I got to see a Mr. York undergo a breathing test and some nuclear imaging, which were enlightening (and a too little violent foran elderly patient, in my opinion). Anyway, he told me hisson doesn't want to get senior photos, to which I replied would be a crime. God knows where that came from - usually I hateseeing myself in photos,let alone posing for them like atrained chimp, albeit a well-dressed chimp.Maybe I'm just excited for tomorrow, even though it's supposed to rain. Oh well.  Do I have anything else to ramble on about? Yeah, probably . . .hold on a sec.Oh yeah, our shitty 1997 233 mHz IBM behemoth of a computer died on Wednesday. I didn't want to deal with it, so my mom took it to a repair shop on Gratiot to get it fixed. Turns out that the second hard drive we put in about five years ago was to blame, and the technician just had to disconnect it. But then he f***ing proceeded to rehaul the operating system, which, being Windows 95, is f***ing retarded because the thing is so f***ing slow and full of holes that no one will be able to tell the difference! Enough gratuitous use of the f-word? In this case, it was appropriate. All of these further so-called "repairs" were done without my knowledge. The technician obviously knew that he could take advantage of a middle-aged woman with little knowledge of computers. I later, irately, told my mom that the $100 she dropped on the job was completely unnecessary. She wouldn't have any of it, of course, being too proud and stubborn to admit that I was right (and believe me, I don't lie when it comes to computers). F***!  I suppose it's time to wrap up. It's been a long, infuriating week and all I want to do is go to bed. To sleep, perchance to dream. Oh, but guess what I have to dream about? My aunt has gone completely nuts and is undergoing electroshock therapy for depression in a faraway state. My other suicidal aunt is the cook ata girl's summer camp, where the counselors will probably find her face-down in the lake one morning. On top of it all, my satanic grandparents (the ones who caused severe disfunction in their children, as evidenced above) are coming to stay at our house for the weekend. Joy! Maybe I'll just down some cough syrup and "let the whole thing pass me by" as Trapt would say. Nah, I'd never do that, despite the impression this post may have given you. I'm probably the most sane member of the family. That really isn't saying a whole lot, but at least I have something to get me through the day. *sigh*
