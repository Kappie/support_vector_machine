I just saved my life  possibly . I have evidence from people all around me that the mosquito had the potential to bite me.‚Äù  PETA says: "Whatever! That fly was no threat to you whatsoever! It wasn't a grave threat. Sure, if it had stayed around long enough, it might have tried to bite you, but it wasn't doing anything at the time"   think about it...
