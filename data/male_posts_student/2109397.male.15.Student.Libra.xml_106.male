And they hang out with Tripp the fucking faggot fuck. Do they not know what he did? I mean seriously who would hang out with someone who narced on like 30 people just so he didnt get expelled and then he ends up not even going to our school anyway. If you cant take the shit you are going to get then why do it. He fucking narced to save his own ass and then he expects to be able to tell everyone and make some damn excuse up everytime it comes up. Even now when everyone knows he still thinks he can lie his way out of it. Stupid fucktard he is. I wish I could just get my licks now. And then he goes and files a lawsuit every fucking time he gets touched and tries to fucking frame a kid. Fuck that, he made a fucking false charge up and had a kid sit in jail for 5 and a half ours. Fuck that shit. That kid deserves what hes gonna get and I wish I can be there to see him fail at life. I cant wait until we play him in soccer oh my it will be fucking hell. No one will give a fuck how fucking violent it will be. I personally and know of others who will not care about cards and everything. The kid really should not want to play against us.  Ok, I'm done caring about whatever the fuck is going on in that little story for now.  No one is online right now. Usually someone is on at 3am but noooo not tonight.  School starts in 2 god damn weeks. I swear I am seriously not looking forward to school. Itll be the 2nd or 3rd worst day of my life. School sucks and I hope this year goes by fast as fuck so I can get the hell out of Ballard.   Soccer isn't going too awful good. I have had one good day of practice and I hate the god damn freshman who are on the team. They all suck except for one kid and theres also a good eight grader. But the frosh are fucking annoying as hell and I can't wait to bitch them out in games. Assuming I play, I'm worried that I won't get to play the games I want to and I hope the coaches give me and Sam equal time and/or ask me and him how we would like to split it up. My thumb is still fucked and it's making me mad, it doesnt help that I have like no break to let it rest. I even played today and like shit. It was sort of a waste of time, the grass was long as fuck and we all werent playing good and I wasnt really trying. So basically all it did was get us tired and make me jam up my thumb again. I think I'll just tape a spine to the thumb of my glove tomorrow so I'm not as hesitant to go down and slide, deflect with both hands, and catch with both hands.  I have to do the fucking recycling fuck/  I'm getting real sick of all the bitching that goes down in my household. My older sister keeps talking about her car accident, which I guess she has reasoning to but it gets old when she talkse about how her friends are going on about their "injuries" when the "werent injured" and how stupid they are. She has reasoning and everything I'm just getting sick of it. The younger one keeps bitching about the soccer team and how she wished she was on Varsity and how she should be on Varstiy. And then she starts going on about her little "injuries". She thinks her ankle is messed up or something and she wears a brace on it every chance she gets. All she did was fucking roll it. She's such a whiney ass BITCH. I really dont care about her little injuries and shit. Spare me. Then she goes on and on about how much attention the older one is getting because of the accident and how her birthday is ruined and no one is caring about her birthday. She needs to get used to it, I havent had anything fun done on my birthday in years but do I care, not really. She has enough shit as it is and she keeps saying "Mom I better get ____,_____,_____,_______ and ______ or else you'll be sorry!" Fuck those bitches have like the biggest ass bills from American Eagle and Gap and all those prep stores. They spend SO MUCH DAMN MONEY, it's not even funny. They yell at me for getting $200 cleats once a YEAR when they spend $600 in clothes every MONTH. It sickens me. I don't get anything except soccer stuff and I dont care. They get clothes every god damn week and they want more and more and more.  Ok I guess I'm done for now. Later haters.
