Sometimes I like it that way though.  Today was neutral.  I had to get up early for running for a while.  That was cut short because we had to work on getting the sod laid down for the practice football field.  At first we didn't lay sod, we just removed rocks and stuff that would make the surface uneven or damage the sod.  That was pretty boring.  Then I left after picking up most of the rocks.  I went home and ate an early lunch.  I usually have two sandwiches that my mom makes me.  I always take for granted that someone makes my lunch everyday.  I should probably thank her tomorrow.  She’d be happy about that.  After I ate my lunch, I had to go to a basketball practice.  Pretty soon I’ll be going to a team camp and we went over some stuff about the camp.  It was just basically handing some papers out and going over a few plays.  Then I had to go back and actually lay some sod for the field.  I stayed there for quite some time.  From about 11:45 to around 3:30 I worked.  I must admit though, about an hour or so of the time, I had the easy job of helping the fork-lift guy line up the forks with the center rings on the sod coils.  That was about it, but the day seemed really long for some reason.  As of now, I’ve lost all my productive thought.  Time for bed.  I miss Stephanie :-(
