I don't know how I can fix them. I tried really hard, and this is what I get. I don't understand. I rearranged my room and made it spotless Friday night. Saturday morning, my father must install a pipe under the kitchen floor (my ceiling) and now my room is a total mess. Sheetrock powder, moved storage units, torn up ceiling. The disorganization is causing my physical pain, in my head. And now I discover he has written his notes all over my PE homework.   Reading over the above paragraph I have come to the conclusion that I'm starting to become very indignant towards every little thing. I know he'll clean it up and yet I find myself glaring at him constantly! In other news, my new favorite food is Peace Cereal's Apple-Cinnamin Crisp. So good. Granola, oats, apples...yum. It's a little libral for me, though. They donate 10% of their profits to anti-Bush stuff. Anti-Bush people are quite silly. Especially those who support Kerry. Kerry  voted  for the war. He  voted  for collecting the 87 billion dollars to support the troops. These people claim to hate Bush because he is behind the war! It's like they don't know what they want! Kerry also seems a bit confused...he says things that he doesn't even know that he's saying! He just spits out statistics and expects votes. We'll see about that.  School tomorrow. But only a half day on Wednesday and next week a few days off and the week after that no school for spring break. I'm going to Southern California. Can't wait. School is killing me.
