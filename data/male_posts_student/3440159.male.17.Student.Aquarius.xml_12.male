All you do is call a number, imput your unique information, then record a message, and they'll post it to your blog. It's pretty sweet. They say it's useful when you're away from a computer, on the road, or just want to hear your voice. It's stored on their site in mp3 format, then when you click on a link, like the one below, it'll download and play the message. It's pretty neat. Anyway, it's cool... If you're on blogger, try it out.    Audioblogger.com    urlLink
