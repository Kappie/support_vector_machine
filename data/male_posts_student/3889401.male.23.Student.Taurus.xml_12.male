This guy is there to get a ticket from Champaign to West Lafayette, Purdue and gave his credit card to the Afro-American Girl at the counter.  Girl: What is you father's name? Guy: Excuse me. Girl: I asked your father's name? Guy: (Paused Astonished. With an accented English this time) Why ya need tha? Girl: To issue the ticket. ( Girl is equally amused and astonished.) Guy: Why the hell you need my father's name? (Guy thinking...My dad is not single. He is happily married to my mom.) Girl: (Angry, annoyed and amazed) I need your first name , Sir. Not your father's name. Guy: Thats on my credit card. Girl : Oho...  Witness to this event were Mitrabhanu Sahu and Vikram Jadhao , both doing their PhD in Physics, UIUC. The guy is me. I guess I made a follow up to the blog written by Ankan.
