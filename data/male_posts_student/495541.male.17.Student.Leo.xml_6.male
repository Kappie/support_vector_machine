Just to make sure it doesn't mess up.  That annoys me so much because all this effort and thought goes into something only for it to be erased in an instant.  That is so annoying you cannot understand.  Well I've been thinking about wanting to get a laptop computer.  I'd really like one.  They're expensive but it would be so handy.  I could put it in my room.  Whenever I have an idea, I'm spoiled enough to not want to write it down.  I always prefer to type my thoughts because I can type much faster and no matter what way I type, my type writing comes out the same according to the font.  So that's the main reason why I like the computer over writing.  That's not so say that I don't do writing.  I do a lot.  In fact I do have a journal I write in, but lately I have not.  I'd like to just be able to lay in bed, with a laptop and type and type and type.  I did it for a while when my sister sent her old laptop home for me to fix it.  It was awesome.  I'd think of things so productive it'd amaze you.  It amazed me.  I'd reread it and say, is that my typing?  It also brings so much truth too.  It was about a month period I used it and there's so much stuff that just kills me.  I mean the kind of stuff that's just straight out, no BS type stuff.  I'd just plain out say what I had to say and it'd be great.  So that's why I want a laptop so bad.  It would also be nice to have it hooked up to the internet.  Better yet wireless networed.  That might be pushing it though.  Wireless networks are expensive.  My Dad said he might be able to hook me up with something at work, so we'll just have to wait and see.  Tonight I played intermural basketball.  I actually played on two teams.  I hadn't even signed up with either of the teams.  I just played.  I played pretty good too, I think.  I'm oddly pretty sore from that.  Maybe it's just from the lifting.  I think so.  I don't know if I have lifting tomorrow but I'm not going to go.  Bob said that they'd start to expect (or something along the line) us to be lifting and isometrics next week.  So I don't know but I don't want to go lifting tomorrow, I'm sore.  What else?  I don't know I keep thinking.  Thinking about someone... a lot.  Most of the people I know best would know who I'm talking about but this is killing me.  Instead of listening to raging rock music, I find myself listening to slow tempo you-don't-love-me-ish music.  If you can get at what I'm saying.  Music like Coldplay, DMB, Jack Johnson just to name a few.  I love their music, but it's quite depressing at times.  To let you know, I was going to just type something incredibly funny to end on a funny note, but I can't let it happen.  I'm not going to allow myself to be mocked.  Ha!  Good night.
