It is WAY more fun to eat the big one if you ask me. Everyone I would like yall to meet Josh my invisible friend. *claps echo throughout the room, cheers jar at people's ears*SO, He and I also got into an argument today. He asked me if they had Girls' bathrooms in gay bars, and I told him no because I honestly don't ever remember seeing the little sign thing even ON the stupid door. Not like it would REALLY matter though. The little sign for a girl's bathroom is that stick figure with a dress. Call it a queen and most gay guys would be happy.   Something to do to impress me: Change your name to Mr. Crunch and join the Navy. Then they can call you Captain Crunch. It will tickle my fancy.  I swear ever since I got here every gay guy I meet is practicailly shoving thier cock down my throat, I swear jus to all of them give it a rest!  i am sooo tired of trying and trying, it is soo hard!  I am not one to have sex without there being love.  I have been here only 19 days!
