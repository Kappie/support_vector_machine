However, the important thing is that his internet connection was down and I could not post or look stuff up, so sry for the poor post. I got three discs of full metal panic a sun coast, and even got Mark to buy one. He is now hooked. Heheh….  Kris, I have heard of that theory, and find it more likely than reincarnation. My personal favorite theory though is the seventh conscious theory. It’s not very popular, but I like it. It says that humans have at least 7 layers of consciousness, the first being the one we operate in every day, the second being our subconscious, and so on and so on. Each layer has certain properties to it, and each one is interconnected the ones surrounding it. They were once all spelled out to me, but I’m afraid I lost the paper and have not found another one. Any way, they can supposedly be reached through meditation and or hypnosis. I have personally experienced the third and fourth layers, through self hypnosis, a lot fun actually. Any way, the theory is that the seventh layer of consciousness is a universal one, shared by all of us. Others say that is God, a universal consciousness, not limited to humans, but also shared by spaces and objects. This includes past, present and future possible multiversional turns. There have been three occurrences that I have found that seemed like they involved people able to reach this layer, the most recent being in 1950. This could not have been the case for Sprinkle, as he was only in the second layer, which is the most useful one as it is directly connected to the layer we spent most of our time in. All of them involve a hypnotist and patient, not one of them was a self induced state. Boo hoo.   In other news, China has taken to censuring text messages on phones, and has already punished three companies for resisting. Make us look more like Free State, which is a good thing.
