I for myself had a pretty good day, beginning with a theory exam. Not the best beginning, but things would hit a climax when I got my cell phone lol. So here's my short, somewhat summarized entry on they day before Mother's Day.  I woke up at 830....and realizing I woke up later than expected I rushed around the house, crammed the very final few minutes I could and then ran out the door, multitasking of cramming, drinking tea and listening to music. So finally rushing to the Social Sciences centre, I run up the stairs, make a few complicated turns *all this is without my glasses so I can barely see signs since my glasses broke* and then FINALLY.....I manage....out of the bluriness of 4.0 poor eye sight........I FIND ROOM 2028.....  And I walk in thinking I'm late....and quickly rush for a place to sit. However.....hmm I have no paper. That was when people began to direct me around places.....making me look like a dumbass. Wasn't too bad though....it was my "big" entry into the theory class.....confused, distorted, and VERY dazed about what is happening and yes I realize those words all pretty much mean the same thing. Waking up 30 minutes before my exam though, yes things like that can happen. So after finally managing to find my stuff, and get myself settled.... I pull out my gargantuan clock that I brought in for time, and set out my writing utensils and stuff and then prepared to write my exam....  Writing away, I start off writing out the words as I tend to forget many of them. Unfortuantely I blanked out on two, but meh that only puts me down to a 98 for a highest mark. Grr that lessens my chance of getting my trip to Pizza Hut though. So while writing, I decided to take a break halfway through since I had two hours to write it. So started having a thumb war between my left and right hand *It's REALLY boring in there* and made a makeshift drumset for pencils out of erasers my pencil case and other various objects I found in my pencil case. Checking over the test a few times then, staring into the ceiling, and trying to see how blind I really was took up most of the remaining time then....and before I knew it time was up. Wow.....celing staring is very efficient to waste time apparently.  After the exam, quickly ran out the door excited about going to Toronto. Though it tends to be drab at times walking around the same stupid FOB mall everytime, every once in a while something interesting may occur. So anyways got picked up, then picked up one of mom's friends and then we headed out to Toronto....first stopping by a McD's for some lunch and then on the highway. While on the highway, talked for a bit, mostly about my plans of making a bridge to stretch from HK to Vancouver for easy driving access between the two cities, ate, and after feeling full from a good grease platter I decided to sleep the rest of the way.... ahh yes sleep my favourite part of a car ride...  *3 hours later*  FINALLY arriving in Toronto, we first go grab some dim sum in that restaurant in Pacific Mall. With nothing better to do while waiting for the food, I tried to expand my readable chinese knowledge to two words. I usually do this since what's there to do that's more productive....and for some reason I like to read the names of Dim Sum lol. Plus it prepares me for the future when I have to order Dim Sum on my own *omg what a lame excuse but valid =P.* Shut up if it isn't. So after food came, quickly my family dived into the food.....and after 45 miutes of eating.....got the bill and left.  So while mom went to buy stuff and grandma went to get her haircut, me and my dad walked around the mall looking at cell phones at random FOB cellphones store. Then we passed a Rogers Wireless store. Then we thought "hey why not get a cell out here?" So I finally got my cell phone, going through all the paperwork and stuff when all of a sudden.....BRLLIANCE OF PUTTING TWO HEADS TOGETHER! We could get mom a mother's day gift! WHOO IDEA GOES THROUGH! So in the end we got some family plan, and activated my Motorola C370 or sometin like that and Mom's LG *eew I hate LG phones.* Then after getting everything set, we go and give mom her Mother's Day gift...and head to dinner.  Dinner: Basically ate at Richmond court then went home. I had some baked chicken thing with fried rice and a coke w/ ice cream thing. It was GOOOD. Richmond Court never fails =P. Anyways ate, payed bill, then got home.  Finally arriving home.....we drop off grandma at her house *across the street,* chatted with my uncle for a bit who just pretty much put surround sound everywhere in his place, and then got home.  Now I go SC then sleep hehe. Cya =P.
