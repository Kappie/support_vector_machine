My timing is so off today. I wonder why.   O.o! The 8-9 part is the Red Carpet Event, where lotsa stars are being interviewed. I only recongized Reba, Tom Cruise, Sarah Jessica Parker and some select few. Heh Heh. The other stars are so foreign to me. Heh Heh.   After the RCE, it was the main event. O.o There are so many categories. Frankly speaking, I was kinda bored. All the flims either I didn't watch, or not yet in Singapore yet. At 10, I decided to read my borrowed books and didn't pay attention to the award show. However, I know Angels In America and ROTK are both big winners, securing many awards.   At 11+, I abandoned the award show and went to watch my tapes. I taped "CardCaptor Sakura: The Movie 2" and "The Simpsons" on Sat. The CCS Movie is so nice! Sakura finally biao bai to XiaoLang! So romantic! :D Oh yes, there's a new card, but of course, Sakura managed to feng ying! So cool! Meow moo! The incompetent brother missed out 10 minutes of my Simpsons, because he was playing his game. Ergh!!  After that (and lunch), I went online lor. Surfed around, played some games. MuggleNet Interactive is so open leh, makes me feel so much like home. It made me more open, more willing to discuss my ideas. Yeah. Heh heh. Moo meow!   At 6, I went offline and bathed. After that I ate dinner and watched the TV. Comedy Nite last episode le! Ayierr!! Come back soon leh!! Meow moo!  Ahh well. I gotta get going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
