Your heart may seem broken and torn, But wait, because a rainbow comes after a storm.  Even if your world grows darker with each passing day, Remember that there are people around guiding you all the way.  The path before you may rise or plummel, Yet know that hope lies at the end of every tunnel.  So endure this cold winters' night, Because one day, just one day, your face will feel the warm summer sunlight.  Have Faith.
