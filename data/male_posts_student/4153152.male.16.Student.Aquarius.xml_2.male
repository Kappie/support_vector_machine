It varies, but I usually have one good day for every 3 "I'm quitting" days. I know it's a good job for me, but I take a lot of flak from people who just kind of feel like yelling because they don't know what else to do. The guy who was yelling at me today is actually one of the nicest guys I know, but when I told him that Jetta was going to charge 140 bucks for a laptop battery and next-day shipping, he was not happy. Not happy at all. To be fair he's already had to replace the motherboard and CD/DVD-ROM drive, but that was under warranty. Still, all that stuff going bad isn't right. I wouldn't be as annoyed by it, but he told me that it was my fault he had to pay so much, that we did poor work, (Even though we have NO part in the construction of these laptops) and that he would never buy anything from us again. However, he bought two Jetta laptops through us at the same time, same model. The other one has not been in our shop since the day it was bought. It seemed pretty ridiculous, now and even at the time. You tend not to laugh in that kind of situation though. It seems like I've been the target of a lot of bitching lately. Tally one for the "I'm quitting" pile.  On the home front, two of my uncles and one aunt are in town. The uncles, they're cool. One of them brought us a pottery wheel and a kiln. He's teaching my nephew and I how to make cups, bowls, and generally anything radially symmetric. I may get back to you on that. I'm pretty excited, and if I can finally scrounge up the money for a digital camera, I'll send pictures. For now, I'm going to bed. I have a feeling work is going to suck tomorrow.
