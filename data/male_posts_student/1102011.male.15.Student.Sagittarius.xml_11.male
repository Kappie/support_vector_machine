But the thoughts and feelings, No one will ever be able to see.  Some say I'm psycho, Some say I'm just weird. It's like I'm a different person, And the old me just disappeared.  I get really edgy, I want to commit suicide real bad. Then I get a headache, Followed by feeling sad.  I wish I could get help, I wish it would go away. Maybe if I keep praying real hard, It will some day.  -MiNg-
