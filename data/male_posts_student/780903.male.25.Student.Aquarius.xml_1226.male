That means that if you submit, you have a pretty darn good chance of winning the big money. Details are at the bottom of this email."  I found that amusing and worth sharing.  Don't know exactly why.  I went to court today, to watch and take notes.  This was actually the only time I'd been in a courtroom besides a high school trip to Washington where we sat in the Supreme Court visitors gallery while they announced something.  All I recall is Justice Thomas kept spinning around in circles in his comfy-looking chair.  Anyway, at this court thing lawyers said stuff and the judge said stuff and it wasn't very long and now I'm back.  Sorry if all those specifics bored you.  Things not to do in court: 1. Clap 2. Boo 3. Hiss 4. Jeer 5. Throw fruit 6. Throw vegetables 7. Throw up 8. Throw table over 9. Graffiti 10. Scream 11. Yell 12. Run 13. Brandish weapon 14. Use cell phone 15. Brandish cell phone 16.
