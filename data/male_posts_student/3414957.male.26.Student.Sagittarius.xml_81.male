I drew a picture of my vacuum cleaner with a football helmut on top of the handle with a roll of toilet paper hanging out of it. This class is interesting but difficult because I am not a very strong or structured artist. I like random drawings, lines, and chaos on the paper. I guess you could call my style abstract. The teacher doesn't seem to into abstract so I better do well on my next project.  So I think I might watch another movie or something. Maybe I will watch Starship Troopers 2. Yeah, I think I will.
