Any way the point is I watched it and while I did I messed with the HTML for this blog. One thing about this site, its not very user friedley, but you can mess with the HTML and change the way it looks, if you know the language... Anyway I changed some of the words on the site to things like "hey kids!" and so fourth. I plan on making more changes later, but who knows... I figured out how to make this box bigger, but I'm not sure its a great idea, there may be a reason its this size. One reason I know its this size is to make the corners all round, if I enlarged it it would loose the roundness, at least on one side (because the corners are actually a definite sized graphic) that's why its always the same size, I could change it to accommodate the size of the window but yes... It was fun figuring it out though. I learned some HTML before, but that was a while ago... And I never did anything this complicated. Luckily I know enough about how programs are set up to figure it out and "break the code", so I guess I didn't need to get my sister after all, or a book. Anyway I'm proud of myself.  Just thinking as I was writing that, I need some kind of symbol to let the reader know I'm about to ramble mindlessly, and they may want to skip a bit. Like I could have used it up where I was explaining about the corners, actual I could use it on this whole post, actual 90% content you read on this blog you may want to skip. Perhaps a easer thing to have is a symbol that means this may be worth reading... humm.... Ok bed for real.
