I was just ending my post with my normal witty remark, when I decided to check my email at the same time. I mant to open up a new window, but it didn't quite work that way. I apoligize for all of you who were waiting with their tounges drooling to see what would happen next in the life of Colin "The man, the myth, the legend". I will tell you tomorrow. Good night everyone. Remember "Only you can prevent forest fires."--famous last words of Smokey the bear after really finding out why his name is "Smokey". Sleep tight. Can anyone give me the definition of sleeping tight? I really would like to know so I actually know what I'm saying to everyone when I say this. I will type up a full account of my day tomorrow morning, when I am not pissed off at my computer anymore. Good night everyone.    *EDIT*  Well, it's about 2:00 PM the following day, but that doesn't mean I can't give you a recount of yesterdays events. Here it goes.  I woke up and walked out to the living room, my dad was playing Mario Golf. Yea, everyone says I'm lucky. "Your parents play Nintendo? Wow, your lucky." All it means for me is that I have to fight for the GameCube every once and a while. My dad left for work and I played for a little while. Then I got bored and decided to read for a little while.  Reading update: In the past few days I have read 2 and a half books. I started out with reading Seventh Son. Then sometime yesterday I finished Red Prophet (the second in the series of 5 or 6 books). Now I am reading Prentice Alvin and I am already halfway through (after starting it a few hours before youth last night). I read fast and I read a lot.   I finished the book and went to Funcoland (a really cool video game store an overall 10/10 on the Colin scale) and we looked around for some games. I think this was the second time I walked out of that store without having bought anything. Well, I did reserve a game for 5 bucks (Viewtiful Joe, awesome game, I've played the demo). The first time I didn't buy anything was when I was out there at the Regal (a movie theatre right near-by) with Dominique (I miss you so much! (L)). Well, I really wanted to get Mario Golf. So I we went back to Livermore (Funcoland is in Dublin, some 15 odd minutes away). We stopped at Target and there it was in all its splendidness and awesome power. Mario Golf. Now I'm the kind of guy who would buy the guide to a game that took less than 10 hours to beat. I'm just obbsessed with guides. Unfortunately there is no guide out for Mario Golf, or if there is, Target doesn't have it.   Well, at 5 I went over to the church to practice with the worship leader. I might start co-leading worship for the rest of the summer. I can't wait to start, if I do that is. I also saw what GZ (Ground Zero, the name of our youth group) is going to look like for the school year. All I have to say to anyone reading this who goes to GZ is this: Ha Ha. It is going to be awesome and really different from what is normally there. I'm not allowed to say anything else though.   Well, I was there and about 10 or 15 minutes before prayer started my stomach started hurting a lot. Now whether it was because I was genuienly hungry or if I was just nervous about something, I'll never know. Then we had small groups and our group was outside. It was freezing cold! If I knew that we were going to be outside than I would have worn longer pants, and maybe shoes. As it was, I was in shorts, sandals and a very thin t-shirt.   Speaking of my t-shirt, I think four or five people read it, and it was amazing because I have almost had that t-shirt for a year and they were reading it like it was their first time. The shirt says "I still have a full deck, I just shuffle slower". Most people won't get it, they probably should wear it. One of my friends has a shirt that says "If I got smart with you, how would you know?". I really want that shirt. It is so hilarious. Again, if you don't get that shirt, you probably shouldn't get the shirt. I found a lot of geeky shirts, which is just the kind for me, seeing as how I'm a geek and proud of it. I want a shirt that says "Gamer." and that's all it says. It fits me completly, as you may have noticed by now. I have probably mentioned playing games in all of my posts and I will continue to. Well, this is all for now. I will be back later tonight to post todays thoughts. Good night everyone...er...good afternoon.
