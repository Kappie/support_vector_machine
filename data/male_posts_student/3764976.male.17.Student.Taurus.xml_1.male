Speaking of entertainment, listening to my sister and my mother bitch is hilarious! They just don't quit until one of them gets their feelings hurt or my dad tells them to shit the hell up. Big ups to dad! My dad is pretty cool shit. You should all meet him some time. Definately the coolest dad around. Jon and I are starting a new band with a kid named Dan from Concord. Jon and I already have like 6 songs ready to work on so it's going alright so far. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday night. Definately a must see for all those who want to know some cool facts. Yeah...so...Wimbledon is going on this week, which rules all. Go Andy Roddick and go USA! Take the title from the stupid Europeans. For those of you who know who I like...somehow I still like her so I'm just truckin' along here. Maybe someday I'll grow the courage to ask her out. Who knows, right? I guess that's it for right now. It's official, my cherry has been popped, blog style!   Music Playing Currently: Senses Fail-Buried A Lie
