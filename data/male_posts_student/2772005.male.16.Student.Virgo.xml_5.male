On this day, the 29th of January 2004, it is declared that Of Life and Lurrrve... is at war with The Journal of the Bloodfist Klan. Oft have we borne stoically the Insults and Calumnies of the leader of the (snigger) Klan. No longer shall we submit to this. There is a time for fun, and a time for peace. A day may come when we submit to this, when we forsake our self-respect, and lose all our aatmasammaan, but it is not this. THIS DAY WE FIGHT!  Our will is set. The infidel leader of the Klan, who hath abused our tribe for long, shall be driven in the dust.   The Lord above knows we have never been the aggressors. Indeed, we have often extended the warm hand of friendship. No longer. No longer shall we allow our friendship to be mistaken for weakness. We may be peaceful, but we care about our honour. We shall assuage our dignity.  Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that, should This Blog and its allies last for a thousand years, men will still say "THIS was their finest hour.  I call upon those who have courage, those who are honourable, and those who have Internet space support us. To the others-  "Tremble, tyrants and traitors  The shame of all good men"  Manav  PS - With profound apologies to Winston Churchill, Tolkien, La Marseillaise and indirectly,  Shakespeare
