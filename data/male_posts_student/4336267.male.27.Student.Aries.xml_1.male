However most of the existing proxy cache schemes require manual configuration of the cooperative proxies based on the network architecture.  Due to the size and the complexity of network structure and the nature of the existing caching protocols, complex organization and management decisions are often left to the institutions and the system administrators.  Besides manual configuration, there are other problems in existing proxy caching schemes.  These problems include complexity, load balance, hit ratio exaggeration, cooperation misuse, scalability, data replication, availability, and adaptability.  The objective of this proposed research is to reduce the complexity of managing the distributed proxies using a novel cooperative proxy caching scheme.  Each proxy in this proposed proxy cache system makes its own caching decision based on an individual-based cache model.  The Web documents are automatically replicated in the proxy cache system based on demand.  The cumulative results of the individual caching actions by all proxies automatically distribute the data closer to the clients.  These caching actions create artificial life for the cooperative proxies and hence build a self-configured, self-managed, and self-stabilized cooperative P2P proxy cache system.
