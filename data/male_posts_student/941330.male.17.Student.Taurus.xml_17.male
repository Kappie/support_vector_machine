As for my boring weekend...well...basketball with the guys on Saturday, then Jack in the Box with Alex, Erik and Eugene (it was weird cuz we barely talked while eating, but after eating it was way more fun), then we went to Alex's house to watch as   my CPU alter ego balled out of control   in NBA 2k3 (he has crazy shots, driving skills, and looks almost black to boot...pretty good for his   68 rating  ). Today, I played basketball for two hours and got pissed at myself for wasting my summer and first semester when I could've been practicing ball instead. Oh well,   never too late to start  ...  Oh yeah (thanks Kat)...enjoy President's Day everybody. Respect the legacy of our founding fathers by...uh...loafing around and watching TV and   catching up on much-needed sleep   and stuff.
