I'll probably add a part after one part to make it sound better and to make the song longer. Maybe I'll post the lyrics on here...  Oh, yeah.  Mental note:   Be sure to pray for Trey and his friend. He hasn't told me who she is because I know her and she threatened to commit suicide. So there's someone with her 24/7. Its pretty sad...but she needs prayer. So please pray for her...because she needs it...  I'm working on a website with www.freewebs.com right now. Its pretty cool. I'd like to get more options. But, hey, what do you expect from a free website program. Its not bad. I think I'm getting used to it. The address to the site I'm working on is... www.freewebs.com/mattswritings so check it out...Its under construction right now, but you can go there and see it if you feel up to it...  I have to take out teddy, so catch ya'll later...
