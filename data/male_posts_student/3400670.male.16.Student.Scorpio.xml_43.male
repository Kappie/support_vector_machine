Jessica your notebooks will be checked on Friday...along with a quiz.  We will be having a quiz every friday...five IDs from your reading.  I need to keep you honest - we have a few weeks until the AP test. The good news - you can choose to do your notebook or not...I will not be taking the time to grade it after this friday.   It would help if you have read and thought about the origin of the Cold War and its impact on America's society for class the next two days.  I also need the song - "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel - for class.  Does anyone or there parents have the Best of Billy Joel?  I may have it at school but I couldn't bring myself to enter the building this week.  I want to have afterschool sessions on Tuesday and Thursday - they may be time to view and discuss the Centuries, Multiple Choice or review certain eras.  How do Tuesdays and Thursdays work for you guys?   See you Monday... Eye of the Tiger...:)  Clark
