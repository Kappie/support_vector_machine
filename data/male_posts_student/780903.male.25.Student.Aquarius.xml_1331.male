Inspires some thinking on my end that I promise I will share in an upcoming post, but won't promise it'll be today.  Also I owe you part 2 of the Mega-Post on thoughts to ponder when thinking about whether to go to law school.  And, while I'm at it, I'll copy Sherry's lead and do an All-Request Day at some point later this week, because they're fun -- but only if people send me questions.  I'll write something either way.  But the e-mail/day ratio has been falling this week -- mostly because the sent e-mail/day has been falling for a couple of weeks now, I'm sure -- so the more the merrier.  :)
