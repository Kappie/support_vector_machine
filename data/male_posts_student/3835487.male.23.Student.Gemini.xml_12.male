Lately I'm wondering what all this extra schooling is for. I've learned virtually nothing about the practical application of journalism, which is what I want to do. What good is a master's degree going to do me in the real world? I mean, basically, all I've turned into is a research drone doing the same things that I did in undergrad only on a larger scale. Don't get me wrong, I realize I'm lucky to have such an opportunity at my fingertips, but I just can't see where it is getting me. Perhaps I'm just venting due to this impending-thesis-state-of-mind, but sometimes I wish I'd have gotten a degree in landscaping or computers, hell even in counseling so I could counsel teenagers or do something helpful in the world, something of substance, or at least something where my degree has practical application. If I get a job as a writer these feelings will wash away, but if not, I'll be "up shit's creek with paddles this deep." And yes, I realize that school is better than working at a job that I don't like, but sometimes it's just hard to see what the point of it is...  But enough about me. Tonight I saw  Collateral . I was very excited to view this film. Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has let me down again. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was well acted, but the script suffered from boredom. You get the same old philosophizing and plot that you see in countless movies-- I'm crazy because my dad was an alcoholic and beat me, I lived in an orphanage, I'm paired up with an uptight guy and I teach him to be wild and crazy and in the end it comes back to bite me in my ass! Trust me, if you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. The thing is, Cruise and Foxx are so good they make the hackneyed dialogue  sound  good, but don't be fooled. I guess my  Village  experience had me wary going into this one. For some reason, I felt like I was watching an English television drama-- the movie was filmed so that it looked like one of those. You know, like that show on MTV  Undressed . It just wasn't filmed so that it looked like a normal movie. And someone please explain to me the symbolic meaning of the coyote in the middle of Los Angeles-- did Vincent feel like that was him, out of place, all alone in the world? Just a warning, the movie is not like the trailer, it's very slow moving! Enough about that...  Larry Walker is a Cardinal! That should put to rest all the pundits saying the Cubs have a better lineup than the Cardinals. I'm sick of hearing that, as far as I'm concerned, their lineup was better without Walker, but now its leagues ahead. Walker is a career .300 hitter and not just a product of Coors Field. Nomar is not some kind of cure-all for the Cubs, and so far he's batting something like .211. He can't even play everyday due to his injuries. We'll see who wins in the end...  Lit review update...3 pages down, 15 to go. I better go now so I can knock some more off, gonna try to get it down to 13 or 12 to go by the time I go to bed...guess that means no PS2.  Peace out, Alex
