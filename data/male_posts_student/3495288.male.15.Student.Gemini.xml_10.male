To start off i wouldlike to tell you all a story that someone has told me and has touched my heart. In this case of the story i am going write, i will be in the shoes of her life. Those who are reading this blog please do reflect after reading this story.   I was still inBelgium at that time when my little brother, titi (little brother in chinese), commited suicide from the 11th floor, 2days before his 27th birthday. The relation between me and him wasn't that close. He is just 2years old younger than me. When we were young, after my father left me when i was still in primary school and moved to a three room flat in Bedok, there wasn't any communication between my little brother and me. We were just like strangers. We stayed under the same roof and shared the same room, yet does not talk to each other much.   He stopped school when he was in primary school. Atthe age of 13,he already started to smoke, glue sniffing, mixed around withbad company and gamble. Every night i come home, he would smoke in the room. I cannot stand the smoke and smell! I don't even know how did i survive those threatherous moments. My own mother would even bring MEN home or other people to gamble and play mah-jong. She would borrow money from people and used it pay her debts.   It is really shocking to see that gambling has taken over the lifes of my mother and two other brothers.He used to work in a bakery shop. He would sacrifice his time just to get money for him self. Every night he would come home and smell of flour, bread, cookies and cakes. He loves his job alot.I pity him for what he had to go through.   There wasn't much connection between him and me. There are a few times he ran away from home, same goes with the other little brother. When i was away in australia, my little brother was sent to a mental hospital for a few month and while he was in the hospital, my mother was under a lot of depts. A few loan-sharks came and treatened her. My little brother was brought back home a few days before his death. My mother left the house one day, i do not know did he get the key to the window. Once he opened the window, he stood on theedge and than jumpedout.    I recieved acall from my mother,i was still in belgium, when i heard about the news i got shocked. Tears filled my eyes. " Titi tiao liao.",  that was what my mother said to me on the phone, translatedfromdialect  "Little brother commited suicied".  Those were the words i remembertill now. Loosing a little brother whom i have not talked to for almost 2years,before his death. The lastconversation i remembered betweenhim and me was that he askedif i could borrow him some money, which is to pay his debts.   Soon i heard myanother littlebrothergot into a car accident, now he is limping.I could see that mycurrent little brother is actually following,Titi's, foot steps.My current little brother stopped school when he was in sec 3. My mother was pretty upset. People blamed her for my little brother's death. A few years after i got married, i visited my mother. She accused me for not caring and that was why my little brother died. I did not cry or what. I just got angry and upset inside. I dare not show her my feelings. Soon my family, not including me as i am already married, moved out with the help of the government because the HDB said that the aparment is now haunted so the government gave my mom money to buy a new house. With a sum of money left after buying a new house, she got happy. She could pay her debts. Soon she found out that i was giving a sum of money to my father monthly. She got upset. Felt unfair so she asked me that she too wanted me to give her money monthly.   As you can see. How greedy gamblers can be. How terrifying the life of a drug addict goes through. When one have no money and is in danger, he/she will kill him/her self just to stay away from the concequences. To me I think, if my little brother had not gone on glue sniffing and be with bad company his death would not happen. Thats why i am very harsh towardsalot of people.I know that the world out there is  REALLY HARSH, HARD and DIFFICULT.        -=The End=-    I would like to thank to the someone who have told me this story. Its really touching and sad to hear. Thank you again to the someone.   Ok thats all for story telling time. NOW! its time for me to say about what happened today.       TRAUMATISED!       Well woke up as usual. Everything went ok untill the third period, Geography period. During the lesson Bing Lin kept calling me from the back. He kept saying that he likes me, wants to be with me, loves me and want me to be his.  OH WHAT SUCH HORROR!.  I did not care to what he said, just ignored him. When the lesson ended, i was packing my bag till he came up to me from the back. He hugged me, groped my nipples and butt. Of course I got scared! i struggled alot! Than he hugged me tightly and make a kissing gesture. He then tried to kiss me!  OH MY GOD! THIS IS WAY WORST THAN A HORROR MOVIE ! He kept getting closer and i kept getting away from him. The smell of his bad breath! eeewww! yucks! i ran around in the class than grabbed my bag and books. He got hold of my bag and than hugged me again!... he wanted to kiss me badly! My people were staring at me! when he let me go i ran out of the class room dropped my bag, next door class, and ran away from him. I went from my class, till the next class (just beside), to the canteen then back to the second class. I was traumatised for haven sake!. When i got back into class, Bing Lin was standing beside me. I did not notice him. Everyone was getting ready to greet the teacher but instead i screamed. Mr Bruce saw me and asked Bing Lin to go back to his class. I quickly sat down and hide under the table. Mr Bruce got little irritated so he asked me to stand. I was trembling in fear. I was white like a ghost. Clueless like a sloth. Man!why does it have to be Bing Lin!? He so disgusting! So stupid! Mentally Crazy!Idiotic! Irritating! Smelly! Ugly! (and i mean it UGLY!) Man! If it was Daniel NeverMind lah... BING LIN!? EEEEEWWWWW!!!! NO WAY MAN! LUCKILY I GOT FREE!     LET SKIP THIS PART! I DONT WANNA REMEMBER IT!    Ok after school, i did not went for prayers because i was held back by my idiotic teacher. So i spend the whole time in school and then went for art club.
