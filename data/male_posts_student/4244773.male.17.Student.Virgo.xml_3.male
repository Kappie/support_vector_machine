The determination of Arsenal and Henry in the second half was amazing. Anyway they already matched up Nottingham Forest's record of 42 matches unbeaten already and next week, it's the match that maybe Arsenal can lose. Thay take on Blackburn next week and i certainly hope they win .....even if cannot draw is good enough.
