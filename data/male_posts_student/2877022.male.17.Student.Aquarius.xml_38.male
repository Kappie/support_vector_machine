Nus also expressed that he's a "muscle man".  Basically, todae's damn boring even though qianjin and junkai's back from germany. However, that was not the highlight of my entry. i would like to stress that we had 5 absentees today and all of them are.....                     SCORPIOS!!!  ALL our SCORPIOS in 04S08 were GONE!!! except for elane. but even elane was not spared. indeed, she's first in line for the scorpio downfall. She was sick ydae too. IT'S phenomenal!!!!  o dear!!! which sign would be the next??!!!??? the second populous signs after scorpio is.....  AQUARIUS N CANCER!!!!! ( shit!, the whole back row might be gone except for me, yteng, kim and kaihui)
