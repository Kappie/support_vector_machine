My grandma is about to become a regular reader of the blog.  I tested her this morning by telling her my infected testicle story.  She passed.  Pretty incredible.  My mom doesn't know this exists, and that is the best.  If she did, she'd cry a lot.    PB Sandwiches and beer tomorrow, as we float the Lord's Elk.  I'd take pictures, but I don't want to buy a waterproof camera, and anyway, it's just lush vegetation and ugly people on the sandbars.
