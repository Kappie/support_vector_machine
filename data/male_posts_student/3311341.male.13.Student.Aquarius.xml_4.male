I had a detention because I didn't bring my "free reading book" to class, the day before. So, I had to miss one of my "community help clubs". I guess that's what it's called, because we do programming for educational machines. It's fun.  I haven't seen Dom in a while, and she probably has no idea how much she interests me as a friend. She's so nice... If she was reading this she'd be like "Awww, how cute..." Lol.  I've given up on Liv Tyler, because by the time my parents will let me marry, she'll be... Old. Like 45. But she's still hot. I'm now convinced that Alexa Vega is pretty after watching Spy Kids 3-D. She had a music video on the special features, and I didn't like her costume, because even though I'm tempted to look at places I shouldn't, her costume wasn't cool, because... I don't know. It was just ugly. *shrugs*  Creative Writing Club tomorrow. I've only submitted one piece, and I should have handed in atleast ten. I feel bad. I'll write one tomorrow. ;)  Hmmm. I scared a lot of people today by making them think that they were like the person in the Truman show, or the "harvested people" in the Matrix. They gave me funny looks. And I was like "So, you're a machine?"... Their faces remained emotionless.  Nothing to do. It's so boring. But, I found a poem before when I was cleaning my room, and it was really sad, but cool, because it was well written. It had a good story line, also, and I wanted to post it but I couldn't find the book it was in, again.   It was about a boy, who found his cat near a dead baby bunny, and then wandered outside  after his dad. Then he noticed an older rabbit and pointed it to his dad. His dad started crying because he knew that the mother was looking for the baby that his cat had killed. It was sad. Stupid cat. *crys*  I hope that never happens to me. Gotta go to bed. (Almost done with Neoquest II, by the way)
