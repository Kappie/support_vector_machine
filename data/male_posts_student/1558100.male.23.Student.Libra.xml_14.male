Some people, upon visiting  urlLink www.ilovebees.com , are getting more excited than Burt Reynold's in Elle McPherson's underwear draw. What's the deal? Here's a few sites to help you along your quest for truth.  A concise summary/letter concerning the site and blog was posted  urlLink here  and it's worth a read. The mystery continues over at the  urlLink I Love Bees BeeWiki , and it's a comprehensive guide to solving or simply reading the whole thing. For the cynically-minded - just like me - check out GameSpot's  urlLink article  about the situation.  My own personal opinion has been put forward in comment form on  urlLink Dana's blog.  It's an advertising campaign, no doubt, but it's just so awesomely creative and cool that anybody interestd at all in Halo 2 should check it out. My theory? When Dana's system "metastasizes" (the date OXM gets released) Bungie will have a press conference of epic proportions, announcing the early release date of Halo 2 (the countdown to Wide Awake And Physical will be a countdown to H2's release). If you think about it, it's a spectacular manipulation of people's expectations. Usually games are delayed, delayed, delayed until we all wish we'd never heard of Fable (heh heh), but Bungie are onto something. An early surprise release!  At least, that's what I'm hoping. Halo before November? I want it, and it seems that pre-order is the best way to go.
