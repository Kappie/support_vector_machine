My dad just bought a 1996 Trans Am convertible with only 9k miles on it for $15,000. He traded in our 2000 Chevy Venture. I personally think the dealer raked him over the coals on the trade, the van, according to them is only worth $8,700 when the Kelly Blue Book price is around $14,000. But he wanted to get rid of the van so he went for it. Right now, I'm working on finishing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for Xbox. I've had it for a while but I've been playing other games and riding dirt bikes. It's definitely worth picking up if haven't already. Well I'm off to finish beating it now, so until next time, salve.
