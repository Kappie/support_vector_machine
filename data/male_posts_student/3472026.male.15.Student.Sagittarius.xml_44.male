Fox will air two Family Guy mini-marathons opposite NBC's Olympics coverage on Aug. 18 and 25 from 8 to 10 pm/ET, Variety reports. This will mark the first time the show has aired on Fox since the network axed it in 2002. Original episodes of the cult phenom will debut on Fox next year.   Way to go Fox.
