We got up there, set up the tent and then went hiking to find some firewood. Then we had dinner and then went for a long hike. Eventually, we ended up just hanging out by the fire and talking a little. The strange and awkward part was when we went to sleep. Megan gives me such mix signals about what she wants me to do. I feel like she wanted me to be close to her last night but then she says stuff like "You know, even if we do stuff, I just can't be with you anymore." What the hell is that supposed to mean? She would rather be with an ass hole like Kyle. You could tell though that he was always on her mind because she keeps talking about voting and declaring Democrat so that she can vote. This means that she has been volunteering at his work a lot more than what she admits to. This just sucks. I feel lost again. I wish I knew what I could or should do. I guess time will tell.  Long day ahead of me. I have to go to the school, get my books, buy stuff and Wal-Mart, and probably even go to Denver now too.
