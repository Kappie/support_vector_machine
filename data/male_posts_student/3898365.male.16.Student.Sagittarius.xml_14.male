I need to try to create nicer things.    Hmmm. What to say, what to say.    My brother went in for a job interview. He finally decided to get off his lazy graduated ass and join the working force. You know where he applied? That car wash over in Mt. Scott. A car wash. What? Yes. Oh well, at least he's doing something.    I want to work at a book store. Or a library. That would be complete bliss for me. So, my first job is going to be at either Waldenbooks or Barnes and Noble. I never want to work at a fast food restaurant like so many kids our age. Whenever I recognize a kid behind the counter at McDonalds, it makes me so sad. Actually, I never really want to work at any restaurant. Even a big, nice, fancy one. Two reasons for that: 1. I would suck as a waiter because I know I would drop everything. My balance is horrid as it is, and putting five plates in my hands won't help that along. 2. I don't want to know what goes on in the kitchens. I know, okay, I know that gross stuff goes into food. I read  Fight Club.  I know that in restaurants all over the world, the employees spit, sneeze, piss, and do many other icky things to food but I never want to see or know about any specifics.    So I'm going to move into a big city after schools out, either for college or to start a career, and I'll also get a job at a library where I'll meet a cute bookish lady and we'll start a family. Yep, that's how it'll happen. Exactly.    I still don't know what I'm going to do for a career. Not that that's a bad thing, because I'm only sixteen and I won't have to deal with that for a while. But I have possibilities from here to forever. I could go into a scientific field, like something in virology or ecology. I could do something art-related, like painting or directing. I'm signed up for Media Communications next year, so if I like it, I could work on television or radio shows. Psychology is still an open field. My counselor lady today asked me what my stong characteristics were, and when we completed the list, she said I had all the qualities a psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor needs.    I bought the Season 3 of South Park today. And my parents bought me a scale so I can see how fat I'm getting.    Party at Amy's tomorrow! Friends! Movies! But most importantly, AIR CONDITIONING! MUAHAHAHAAHHAHA!
