Excellent taste as well as a drinking buddy( kewei )has made beer a must have together with my other priority/vice gambling. Of course being a drunkard and gambler isn't a very good ambition, but what the hell... Being stuck in an office all day working your ass out for a demon of a boss is ?   I also have an extreme dislike for nails after being pierced by one and having to go for a jab which costs $45..( guess whose fault that was)  It happened in Sentosa and was the reason why our stay there was short-lived. Sorry guys... Then we went to the most horrible steamboat I've ever had. Truly, the food was horrendous and the most entertaining part of dinner was the bluffing of a certain short girl that soft toys are evil and that digimons and pokemons are mortal enemies.  We also had a class barbecue in East Coast that really wasn't a class barbecue because not all went.( I will not diverge those select few people who didn't go ) We had a fun time with everyone getting dunked in the water except for the sub-science boy with his "girlfriend". I subsequently lost my spectacles in the water because of a certain individual( do you see a certain trend) . A few of us stayed overnight there. I was personally responsible for forcing my vulgar and plump friend to stay overnight as well which he still harps on once in a while to my obvious discomfort.  We had an extremely boring night where mostly we played cards and drank beer. Me and my two friends also discussed certain sensitive issues which normally wouldn't have been spoken if not for the fact that the beer loosened our tongues.   Wow, I'm tired from writing all of this so I guess I will sign off now...  Regards, B.C aka Star_Of_Light
