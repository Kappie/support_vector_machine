No one wants to hang out, or can't hang out. And when I do drive across town, nothing ever happens, and I ended up wasting gas and time for nothing. Let's take last night for example. I drove to the god damn strip to hang out with Will, and his best friend, who was meeting up with this dyke. That was okay, but then they had this cross dresser, which just grossed me out. I don't mind guys doing that, it is just weird. You have a penis, why not act like it! If you want to be a girl, get a freaking sex change for god's sake. Damn! Then today I hung out with Nat and her friend, and Nat was going to hook me up with this bi kid she knows, but NO! He wasn't there. Oh well. No big deal. I just will deal with the fact that I am doomed to be single until god knows when. Oh well. Good news though: I saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico. *I like the sarcasm in there. Don't you?*
