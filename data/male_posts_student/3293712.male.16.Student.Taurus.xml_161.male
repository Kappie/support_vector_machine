I lost  Galaxies , sorry. I looked for it a while ago but couldn't find it. It'll probably turn up eventually.  CD I am currently listening to: Operation Ivy's  Energy .  John, sometime this week I need to load the remainder of those songs into Beatbox.  Other than I might perhaps throw up in a few minutes, nothing is happening.  Good night.
