Come to think of it, its was pretty lame of me to had been racing against time to book an entry. Since the last sketch didn't quite fit Tara's standard, I thought of doing a new sketch from scratch. Well, its not totally without any reference. I still had the net as my source of pictures, but I can hardly find any decent screenshot taken from the anime itself. Thus, I had to rely on pictures I've found to figure out the facial feature of the dragons. I had completed a first draft today, but its so damn messy, I dun think I want to post it up. Wait for the second draft to be out will ya?  I had been queuing up for this song call "Without You" by Clay Aiken  Kimberley Locke on mirc for the last one and a half hours, and I think I'm like the 10th in line. *yawnz* Tara's sister offer to help since she wasn't sleeping early , and I was like yawning away. I rejected her offer because I won't want to bother her, and if she were to queue up, she would the 25th in line. Suddenly my dad woke up and headed for the toilet, I switched off the monitor and hopped on to bed. It's just so heartbreaking, all the waiting down the drain. I had to shut down the computer before he notice and send me off to bed. Bah~ nitex
