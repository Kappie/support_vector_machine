I will start with this weekend.  Saturday: Pittsburgh.  Sunday: Church, serving Golden Age Dinner, then shopping for poster supplies (see Tuesday).  Monday: School, Envirothon Meeting with Soil's lady, physical for Drivers' Permit, maybe a violin lesson.  Tuesday:  Election Day, so no school, right?  Wrong, Be @ school @ 9 am to work on poster (see Thursday), order pizza for lunch, leave school around 2 pm, go to Thorpe's Knob in Ohiopyle to study trees,  13 Going on Thirty  in the evening.  Wednesday:  School, then recouping from all the action of the previous few days and preparing for the madness of the next few days, packing for weekend.  Thursday:  Be @ Connellsville McDonald's@ 6:30 am to leave for Slippery Rock University for a Watershed Summit (bring poster), stop at Starbucks/Krispy Kremes first to get sugar,  after summit, go to Grove City Outlets, and then to Sam's Club to get groceries for the weekend, head up to Swiss Mountain at Seven Springs to spend the night.  Friday:  Come down from Seven Springs, school, go back to Seven Springs to spend the weekend studying for Envirothon.  Weekend: Study for Envirothon,sleep, eat, sleep, visit the Springs, sleep, go hiking, sleep.  Well that is the abridged version.  I am tired after just typing it all.  I better go lay down.
