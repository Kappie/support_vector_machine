During the day I've been out playing basketball, soccer, and I've been going swimming. This summer is really going by fast, and I really hate that. This Thursday Pat is going to return to NY, which really sucks. I am not going to be able to see him for about another year. Next week school starts here in NC, so that means I'll get to be alone with Benny. MUAHAHAHA. He is homeschooled, and he won't start for a little while after real school starts here. There really isn't to much going on. TTYL
