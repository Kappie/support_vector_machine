Just feeling a tweensy-bit of nervousness for my Science Practical.  Ayiah...I know what to talk about le. Plain laziness. I hate people who are plain lazy! Like getting up to put your own plates or taking your own calculator will kill you. Yes. Those kind of lazy people. And it's even worse when they don't even want to help you back. Yeah. You've been helping them carry plates, calcuate stuff, throw rubbish...but they refuse to help you throw a single wad of tissue (come on! How many wads of tissue have I thrown for them?). Those people are bai lei (incorrigible?). I can predict that they are not gonna be good bosses (ordering secretaries around....making use of them...how despicable) or colleagues. Alright...I don't know why I am using "then". It should be "him". He doesn't want to waste calculator batteries, so he used CQ's or anyone else. He's too lazy to copy out emals adds on his own, so he made me type for him. He's too lazy to even get his useless butt up the seat and put back plates/throw rubbish/just about anything. He's using everyone to convinient himself. He doesn't care about people's feelings. Why should they be even doing this for him, you tell me? If he is too lazy to do things, then it's his problem. Why should we qian jiu him? We are spoiling him! We are doing him harm! And frankly speaking, I don't know how much I can stand anymore. Yes! Maybe I am still sore at his refusal to help me throw that tissue. I am finding it very un-worthwhile to do things for him. You may chide me for expecting things in return (unconditional love and all), but I find it plain disgusting of being made used at. I can't bear to see my friends being made used of. I am so afraid I am gonna blow someday. But I can't blow. I just repaired this friendship. Ain't gonna be so silly to end this. Must tolerate. ...   Hmm...what else to say ar? Ahh...Mrs Tan didn't come again. Sigh... wonder when's she's really coming. It's making me and Hann nervous. HaHa! I alos dunnoe what am I nervous about. Sigh....Oh yeah! Mrs Chua gave us small little cards wishing us good luck for our Os. That's really sweet of her! Thanks Mrs Chua!   Oh yes! I remembered something! I am going to chalet after all. Yesterday night, me and Wendy have our heart-to-heart talk (hmm....) about chalet. I fully understands how she felt about chalet and how important it is for her to have her friends there. She knew the reaons why I choose not to go chalet, and the guilt I went through because I dissappointed her. In the end, I decided to do. For the sake of our friendship. For the sake of making her happy. For the sake of having fun with my friends before we move on to the next chapter with our lives. I couldn't possibly deny myself of this chance of going just because of two idiots. Hm.So, confirmed le. I am going! Wee!  Alright, you know what? I gotta log off le. Sleep early and all. So, see ya tomorrow with news (or not...tomorrow's Wednesday). Night blog.
