Anyways, this is my fourth blog... but hopefully, I will not be doing this by myself. I already have three blogs as it is... I don't want to do a fourth one.... so hopefully, I can get you guys, my fellow students to help me... Anyways, I hope you like the layout, it's a template called 'Scribe' and it's a slightly edited version by me, becuase I removed the "About Me" section. I don't like that much personally. Anyways, on to the first story!
