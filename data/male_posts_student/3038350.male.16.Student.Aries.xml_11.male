Well today was pretty good, it was very long, I went to skewl and then I came home and finished Ed's pillow (took me only an hour) and then as I was finishing it up he called me. YAY! we talked on the phone for 96 minutes (my phone keeps track hehe) and then I got on the computer and sent him the picture of his pillow.. just the front the back is a SURPRISE! so then he had to eat and I got a shower and then I was sitting around and then Deidra called and wanted to go for a walk so we walked around and then we went and got in gram's hot tub! it was soo great, (it would have been better if Ed was there).  I cant wait til tomorrow when I get to meet him face to face for the very first time.  Tomorrow will be 1 week since we met eachother. Cyndi is the one that introduced us! Thanx Cyndi!!! well I am going to go now.. I have nothing more to say!
