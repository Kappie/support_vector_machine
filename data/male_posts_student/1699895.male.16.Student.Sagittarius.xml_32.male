The Green Tag Savings is going on at Guitar Center for the month of March. There are some sweet deals this time, and I really think you should considering taking a gander soon.  Eric Clapton will be playiing at the Cotton Bowl June 4, 5, and 6. I really want to go, even though I probably will not be able to.  Tickets go on sale tommarow, via Ticketmaster.   urlLink Brickman  is the best game ever, I think you should consider downloading it for the fun.  Going to Cominghome with Summer, oh yeah =)  Full Field games at Wixom started a few weeks ago. Instead of the games being freakishly early, they are freakishly late now, but i guess that is better.
