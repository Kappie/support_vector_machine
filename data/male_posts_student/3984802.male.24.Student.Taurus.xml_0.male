It really was a beautiful hike! I was expecting it to be long, but it was even longer than I was expecting. That was probably partly due to one person having a little bit harder time than the rest of us. I don't think her husband really informed her of what she was getting into. She was tough though, and we all made it. The scenery was gorgeous going up, and the view at the summit was quite amazing as well. If I was on my own I probably would have stopped and taken a lot more pictures. As it was, I still managed to get some good ones that I will try and post soon. I would post them now, but I'm not on my computer at the moment. Sorry.     We did have quite the experience when it came to coming down from the summit. Once you get to the top you can either go back down to Emerald Lake the way you went up, or you can slide down this glacier that leads right to Emerald Lake. Sliding down the glacier probably takes off about an hour of hiking time. And, of course, it looked like tons of fun (to us guys, anyway). So we decided to go that route. Well I tell you what, those girls were scared to death. I admit, it was quite daunting. It consisted of sliding on your back down this extremely steep slope for probably a couple hundred feet, (I'm not really good with distances) trying to avoid rocks all the while. Two guys went down first and they were fine. That left my friend Bryan and myself at the top with his wife and the wife of one of the guys that already went down. It was a long ordeal to try and get them to go down. Finally I said I would go first and then they could follow after and Bryan would come last. I went and had the time of my life. It was sweet, definitely a rush. After some time Emily finally came down, screaming all the way. She didn't know how to stop, but really wanted to stop, but wouldn't do what we told her to do to stop, so she didn't stop for a while. When she finally did she said her hands were all bloody. Well, it turned out that she got a little cut on her thumb and the blood had run all over her hand and looked a lot worse than it actually was. This was a good thing, since (as I found out at the bottom) one of the guys that went down in a group before ours had busted his elbow open pretty good and blood was gushing out. Nice. Anyway, then Diana went finally went down (it was actually an accident... she was just trying to get closer to the edge). When she stopped she was fine, physically, but emotionally she was a wreck. She was seriously hysterical for like 20 minutes. Whoa. It was crazy. Finally Bryan came down and ended up with a foot-long slash all the way down his back. Very nice. It wasn't too deep, but it looked pretty impressive.     Anyway, I don't even really feel much like writing write now. I started to feel sick on Saturday and it got worse and worse until Tuesday night when it was the pits. I was up all night and feeling miserable. Is there anything worse than being sick and tossing and turning all night long? It's at times like that when all you want is your mom. Anyway, I went to the store early Wednesday morning and hooked myself up with some Nyquil and Dayquil. Very nice stuff. I took some Nyquil and slept the rest of the morning and into the afternoon. It felt so good. Anyway, but today I am back at work again and wishing I wasn't. I had to work from 12-4 and now I am working the 5-9 shift. I took some more Nyquil a couple of hours ago and have been feeling okay, but struggling to stay awake. My body just keeps whispering sleep. It's a real struggle not to give in to its lulling. Sweet, sweet Nyquil induced sleep. So that's kind of why I am writing right now, to keep myself from nodding off into a peaceful slumber. I really just hope I get feeling better quick. I have too much to do to be sick! I'm getting behind on my marathon schedule, school, applications, MCAT preparation. Ugh. I just hate to think about it all.     I did meet a new girl this week. Her name is Taryn. She seems like a pretty nice girl. She works at an assisted living center and I've been trying to get our ward to start singing at such a place, so it works out perfect. She's going to help get us hooked up. We will probably start visiting over there on Sunday evenings. Anyway, I should get back to work I suppose.
