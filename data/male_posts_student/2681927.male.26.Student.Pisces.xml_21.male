Since Objectivist's in general haven't really grasped  urlLink David Hume and the is-ought problem , and I told him that, he kind of flipped out. I found that amusing.  Objectivists seems to be a little bit touchy. I wonder what he'll do after my next article I'm writing, where I criticize  urlLink George Reisman  from an Austrian point of view. According to Per-Olof, you shouldn't criticize Reisman. Unless you at the same time state that Reisman is the greatest economist since Adam Smith.
