     
       The Steward of Gondor   Home is behind The world ahead There are many paths to tread Trough shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow, cloud and shade All shall fade All shall fade  The Single most chilling moment ever captured in a Fantasy/Science Fiction movie. Pippen's innocene spoiled and the cold realization that evil exists in a very real fashion rushes into the young face. Everytime I watch Return of The King a sharp spike of fear runs down my spine.
