Not much happened, but I guess that's to be expected.  Both classes let out well before their alloted time and I rushed back to the sweltering inferno that is my apt. to eat lunch and catch a nap.  However, the ever present scream of chainsaws kept me from dozing so I wound up sweating up my bed nicely.          Psych class (something about personality) was chockful of hot women, and I'm guessing they're there to figure out what's wrong with them.  And I'm there to stare, I mean learn.  No Final in that class and its taught by committee.  We'll see how that turns out.        Rhet was the one class I was looking forward too the most during the summer, partly because it involves, well, writing, but also because I had a feeling that I would know the most people there.  And I was right.  Oh, was I right.  Buddy Holly Glasses Girl is in the class.  Cept she wasn't wearing glasses, but I wasn't fooled.  After saying I didn't have much to say about the summer, I rattled off a list of books read and wowed her with tales of Johnny Cash's meth filled hijinks in the 60s.  Meth filled Hijnks, make sure to catch them when they come through town.  (If you are currently searching ticketmaster or in any other way trying to research this band, get a life hipster).    So right, Buddy Holly bast from the past.  Speaking of past rememberences, Rhet class was like a reunion of sorts of various kids from Honors classes past.  To further the weirdness of the situation, my current Rhet class is in the same room as the one from last semester and the kids that are/were in both classes SAT IN THE SAME SEATS!!!  Man, talk about being trained and programmed.  Freaky.
