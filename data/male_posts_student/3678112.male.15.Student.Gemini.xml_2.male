The graphics are refined and there are some awesome examples of texturing, with both characters and environments all looking superb.   In fact, if you’re looking for an example of what Manhunt looks like, then Rockstars own Grand Theft Auto is a good place to start. The character models all look just like the cartoony yet compellingly realistic characters from the GTA games, only with a slight revamp. Jagged edges are a thing of the past and unlike GTA, there is not a single piece of pop-up anywhere to be seen in Manhunt. While the characters all still look rather cartoony, the environments are as impressive as they come. The run down setting looks fantastic, with every cracked wall and dingy corridor being created superbly by Rockstar. The texturing and colours have been used to excellent affect to create the dull, rusty, decaying feel of the games setting.   So we know a lot of Manhunts visuals have been adapted from GTA, but Rockstars latest adventure also has a much darker feel. The games lighting is very low key, with only moonlight and lamps providing the games light source. Manhunt also features a very grainy appearance to add to the dark feel of the game, much like that used in the Silent Hill series.   Manhunt isn’t visually perfect by any means, but is deffinently no slouch and still looks a treat. The game is also arguably Rockstars finest graphical masterpiece.
