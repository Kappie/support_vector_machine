So, my mom dropped me off at Amandas, and we walked up to the bar. I had never been to that one before. It's a totally different atmosphere than Manhattan's, or even Billy Bob's, and I think, If I had to choose, I think I like the small bars better, where you can just go get drunk with your friends, and name the drinks that the bartender invents. She invented one yesterday, and we named it the Red Foreman. What a great night!  It was nice to see Amanda again, I really miss her. So many memories with that girl.  Nikki was there also...so comfortable. I'm told she's    . Silly people.  Ugh. I'm going to go have a shower.
