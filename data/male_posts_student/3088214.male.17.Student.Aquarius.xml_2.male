But hopefully you or some other students can post interesting discussion topics here to keep me and others who will be absent informed.   I do believe that there are lessons to be learned in history so to avoid similar conflicts, patterns, and cycles of violences (otherwise there is no point in enthusiastically studying history). Things do occur in similar way just because of natural ways of human interactions, reactions, and emotions.   And that the dropping of the atomic bomb poses an interesting question and potential debate. I personally don't have a strong opinion of that right now simply because it's such a complex issue.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to invite all the talkative sixth period students to this discussion blog!
