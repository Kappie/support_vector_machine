Yea, on Saturday I went and saw along came polly with Kate, it was funny.  Then we went back to her house and just hung out, we played some twisted metal (she killed me :(...) Then sunday nothing happened, and then on Monday nothing really happened again.  Then today me and Kate went to the coffee bean.  I got some black cherry italian thing that tasted bad and she got a peach smoothie that tasted good so i kept stealing it lol.  There was a puppy there too loL! he was cool.  Then we went back to my house and watched TV and chilled...It was a good way to finish off the long weekend...yea...we had no school today or yesterday.  FINALS ARE OVER, HOLY SHIT THANK GOD.  yea, so much stress is off of me now.  Music? well, Sam (a drummer I sent an e-mail to awhile ago about joining A Burning Reason) contacted me today, and I think we are gonna set up a jam time, if that is ok with Marty.  Also, I have another project that is not going to be advertised at all...all I am gonna say is be prepared to see alot of old faces, and it is gonna be a very fun time.   Shit, it's 9:09, After 9 is my DKT (Designated Kate Time) since my cell phone gets free minutes after 9.  So, I am gonna go call her, and then a new fresh semester tomorrow...things are looking up! :)  "Why don't you admit? You don't have the balls to be a quuueeeerr."
