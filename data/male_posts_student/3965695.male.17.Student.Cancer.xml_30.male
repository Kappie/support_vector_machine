Whats a better low level thing to do than golf. I got to walk a couple miles, whack a few balls, and piss off half the people at the course by being rather loud when I hit a straight shot. It was fantastic. I cant wait until I can play a real sport.  We then went into Gettysburg to do some stuff regarding this cabin we are purchasing, then ate. Good food over there.
