I mean, it's acquired some reflected prestige from your world superpower status, but "O, Say Can You See..." is exactly the kind of namby-pamby 'Lite' song that should never be a national anthem. The lyrics are stupid, and the melody does nothing to inspire the spirit. To contrast: the  urlLink Soviet National Anthem . Of course, we all know it was bad, dictatorship, totalitarian, blah blah blah... but they really knew how to write a bad-ass national anthem. It's the kind of swelling, orchestral piece that can convert a foaming, reactionary fascist into a Party-line Pinko. I'm not saying the US anthem should be Communist, but the style is one we should adopt.  We need a better national anthem, America. Any ideas?   urlLink No.   urlLink No.   urlLink Definate veto material.   urlLink I'd move to Canada and install soundproofing.   urlLink Maybe.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.collisiondetection.net/  how i died today:  urlLink stabbed by a sickle and crushed by a hammer   [Listening to: Rescue Me -  urlLink Aretha Franklin  (02:55)]
