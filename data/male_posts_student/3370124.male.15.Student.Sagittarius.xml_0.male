Lo and behold, I still didn't get my braces off. Anyway, I got to the place on time, but, on the way home, it took. You know what it did as soon as I got on? A u-turn, which then made me go in the opposite direction I wanted. What kind of bus does a u-turn?! Tell me.. none! I wasn't even on the bus for 20 seconds and it pulls a u-turn on me. Like, what the heck!! So so stupid. Ok, so I get off that bus and start walking around. Pretty nice day it was though. Pretty nice day to wait for another stupid bus! Took me an extra 10 minutes to get home.  I'am never taking a stupid bus ever again.
