Okay well yesterday we rented an awesome game. Gael and I had so much fun. It's a world war II game so Gaelan and I were having sniper wars. Heh heh, yeah fun fun. So that was all that really happened yesterday. Today has been pretty good so far, except for something that I can't talk about. Aarghh. Well I'll write more later if any thing of note happens. L8r.
