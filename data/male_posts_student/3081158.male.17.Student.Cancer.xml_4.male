I suppose I could say that it's frightening that Kerry also has a big following. If I was old enough, I'd surely vote for the lesser of the two "weevils," but this is an opinion poll; I'm disappointed that Dennis Kucinich wasn't on there. I mean, come on. This is surely an example of the media fixing the election. ;)  Hmmm... here's what  urlLink William Blum  has to say about a similar poll: "Bush-Kerry  Washington Post-ABC News poll, April 15-18: Bush 48%, Kerry 43%, Nader 6% 45% rate "the war in Iraq" or "the US campaign against terrorism" as the single most important issue in their vote. Once again, as Harry Truman said, "If you give the voters a choice between a Republican and a Republican, they will choose the Republican every time." Unless Kerry offers an alternative to Bush's Iraq policy, he may be doomed. The only real alternative is to withdraw from Iraq, like Spain is doing. But if Kerry suddenly called for that his credibility would plummet.  urlLink Posted by William Blum at 12:13 PM. "  I pretty much agree with what he says. I'd like to make note of the Fox News article, though. Of those polled, 75% of the Bush supporters supported him "strongly," while 53% of Kerry's backers support him strongly, 45% "only somewhat." I'd say that this is a pretty sure sign of a weakness on the democrats' side. I mean, the number of people backing their party is probably as strong as ever, but it seems like a lot of the Democratic supporters only support Kerry as a means to get Bush out of power, not as an ideal leader. I think it's a sign of the political process falling apart.   Clearly, people are feeling less loyal to the metaphorical abstractions -the jackass and the elephant- that allegedly embody certain political ideals. I sense that this means people are becoming more interested in the actual politcal processes as opposed to the ideologies and the people that represent them. This means an actual methodological approach to politics in this country and hopefully the collapse of partisan politics as we know it. Maybe I'm blowing it out of proportion, but history does tend to repeat itself(especially when it comes to the executive office), and elections like the ones we've been having have at typically led to at least a minor reform in parties, the creation of new parties, deaths of parties, and an overhaul of party politics. There are the Democrats, New Democrats, Republicans, New Repubilicans, Greens, Independents,  Neo-liberal conservative Republican Fascists, Banana Republicans, Franco-furters, clandestine white supremicist Republicans and Democrats, wannabe Progressive Democrats, Republicans - that - pretend - to - care - about - the - democratic - process - in - things - like - campaign - finance - reform - but - really - just - want - to - hide - their - corruption (informally referred to as the John McCains), etc.  (Please don't think that all of those are real.)   Anyways, people can argue about whether or not we live in a one-party or two-party system all they want, but I'm gonna settle this once and for all: To most of the politicians, it's all one big party (think record producers living it up with artists' money), and theyaz just doin' it fo' tha luv of tha $$$.  editor's note: some of the above may or may not be satire. just know this: the truth hurts. and save the harsh criticism for another day. it's my birthday.
