It's weird cause yesterday in Lit class , one of my friend turned to me and said " You look pale today , i think you're gonna fall sick tomoro ". I was shocked. And how true it turned out to be. One hour after i came back from college , my temperature increased. My stomach growled. Ouch. Had to skip class today , thank god i only had one lecture today ( the most boring one too HOI ). I'm actuallyfeeling better already , this evening two kind friends were nice enough to drop by and visit me. They even brought me apples! ( Thank uuuu ) Tonight we already planned of going this place to eat mamak food so even if i wasn't feeling too good , i just had to go. Had some good old teh tarik and roti plaster. YUUUMMMMMM. Too bad my stomach wasn't in the condition for my 2nd roti so i had to donate it to some greedy vultures ( kafaii duh ) Oh well i still enjoyed it , i mean , its MAMAK! Now to find some place that sells mango special and garlic cheese naan...
