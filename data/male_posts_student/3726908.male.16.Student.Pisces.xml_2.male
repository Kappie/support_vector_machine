But...don't be mistaken, I have done another Journal in another website which i hadn't disclosed ^^, locate it if you can XP  Ok, this blog would mostly be about my reviews on Anime, Manga, Cds and Games which i have. Also, my hand-written novel would be posted up here as well (hey, i need publicity for my novel) ^^  My novel won't be as creative as Harry Porter, not as imaginative and exciting as Star Wars, but after all...it's my own work...show some support yea? ^^  Finally, if possible...can someone teach me how to post pics up here? Thank you ^^  Next post up: TakaHina's novel : Neverlasting Time Fire Section Chapter 1-1
