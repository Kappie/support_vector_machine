This is a good thing™. This I know from my visit to the doctor this morning.   I'm probablyclinically depressed. This I also know from my visit to the doctor this morning. Also arse. What a lovely month for it. I said that this wouldn't become my personal bile tanker, and that it won't. At least now I have a reason for not finding positive things to say. It explains a lot, like RocKWerchter andAshton Court.   I haven’t had an awfully interesting week on the food front. Since its been low fat and low salt that sort of precludes tasty. Unless someone wants to correct me...   I've started running again after my 2 month layoff. Which, fundamentally, means I'm starting for almost scratch. I managed 2.5 miles in about 24 minutes a bit of a poor show but that’s quite a bit faster than I was running when I stopped. So that’s something positive.   Well I'll update this later this week when my iPod has arrived and/or I've been on my friend Shaun's stag do (bachelor party if your reading this across the pond (that’s the Atlantic ocean))   Now I think I'll lead you in song....   "Always look on the bright side of life........"   :-)   Tim.   P.S. Keep your pecker up sport, I haven't started listening to Nick Cave yet, it could be worse.
