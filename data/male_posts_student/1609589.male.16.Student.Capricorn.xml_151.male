Why do i WANT to go home immediatelly after school?  Why do I sit at my computer every day, waiting for people to get on AIM that are worth talking to?(all... like... 6 of you)  My most fun during the week latley has been church on sunday, and that's usually cut too short by the fact that it's only an hour and a half long.  I sit here, listening to my music, writing in this journal that probably nobody reads anymore, when I could be doing something much more productive, if only I knew what it was.  Don't get me wrong, I love it when people read my webjournal, it makes me feel like I've accomplished something... But i doubt anyone does.  Oh sure, I may seem happy around people, but that's because I AM happy around people. It's when I'm alone when i start losing it.  Ergh, I don't wanna type anymore. I'm so tired, but I don't wanna sleep.  I need human interaction.
