As some of you may know, I'm going to China (Shanghai) on the exchange program (Jan 05-April 05)! And I'm so happy with it!! :P I really want to know how an exchange is like! You are so lucky!! But I'll be joining the club next year too! ;)  This summer (July  September) I'm doing an internship at McKinsey  Co in Madrid. For those of you who may have not heard of it, it is a quite well-known consultancy firm. The job is quite interesting, even though I haven't done much so far. I just hope to be joining the firm by september 05 when I finish my degree!  This haven't been the year of my life definetely, but since May things seem to be going better! I'll be telling you sth more next time! :p  I miss you all a lot! I hope you sometime stop by Barcelona again! You know that you'll have always a friend (and a bed if needed :p) in here!  I look forward to hearing from you soon!  Carles (your buddy)
