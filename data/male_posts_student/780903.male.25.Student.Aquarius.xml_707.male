So I have no choice but to resort to more haikus.  HAIKUS ABOUT INTERVIEWS  Did he hear my knock? It's been almost four minutes Should I knock again?  Bio on the door Let me read it carefully The door opens.  Ow.  Here is my transcript No, don't look at it like that Should I just leave now?  Not this one again My thirty-second soundbite I repeat once more  The hallway's too hot I don't want to perspire For once, there's no snow  Do I have questions? It's not like I had answers How 'bout I just go?  My resume's creased That means someone has read it Or just creased it.  Oops.  Glasses or lose them? A larger sample size and I could answer that  Don't sit till he does But what if he never sits? That is the question
