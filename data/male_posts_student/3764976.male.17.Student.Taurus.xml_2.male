I have calmed down a lot since I lost my deal and I looked at it from both sides and I would've kicked my ass from the deal too! Me and Janelle had a good match, but in the end I was defeated, 56-50. I was upset. Then we went down to the batting cages and met up with Josh and some other kid. I was kinda upset after getting done because I figured I'd get the baseball out of me and I'd suck. Quite the opposite. I was killing some balls in the medium and got a couple of hits in the fast. Now I just miss it even more and am considering dropping even more weight and building up my muscle again just to play. Anyway, after that we went to Subway and got some food, and from there it was up to Borders. I got two Cd's; Bad Religion's "The Empire Strikes First", and Cave In's "Antenna". I've been waiting to get a Cave In CD ever since Kyle told me about his brother's band a couple years ago. I will now do what Kyle did for me and tell you all about two bands that are very good. I want everyone to LEGALLY listen to Matchbook Romance and Hellogoodbye. You can hear MR on-demand right now as their video for Promise in on it. Hellogoodbye you can get from drivethrurecords.com as they are currently giving away their entire EP for free! They have some great songs on it. I think the songs Shimmy Shimmy Quarter Turn and Call N Return are great ones to just have fun to.  I woke up at like 5 this morning and this means it will be a long day. I guess I should've expected to wake up early if I sleep from 5 to 8, get up for dinner, and go back to sleep at 9.  I was just exhausted because I am messing up my sleep patterns bad by not sleeping some nights and just going all out for the next day. I just noticed something random; in the entire day yesterday and from Concord to Hooksett I did NOT see a single hot girl that I checked out! That has got to be some sort of record. That or my standards are way too high. Either way, that's really odd. Another random comment, today is Drive-Thru Records last day on a distribution deal with Geffen Records, meaning no one can steal artists away from them, like Geffen stole New Found Glory, The Starting Line(more than likely), Something Corporate, and had taken Senses Fail before deciding to release them to Vagrant. Those Geffen people really know how to do business......or not.
