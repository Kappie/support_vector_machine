I am glad to see that John Olerud, one of Landute's favorite baseball players, has also returned to NY, albeit with the Yankees.  While Olerud lacks the wit of Frank Castillo, he is a consummate professional, much like Stick.  Italy was sweet.  At St. Peter's Basilica, visitors must wear long pants.  I did not realize this, so I was wearing shorts.  After being denied admission to the Basilica, some shady Italian guy offered me these completely ridiculous black canvas painter's pants for 5 euro.  I tried to negotiate, offering 4 euro, but he would not budge. So I bought the pants for 5 euro and entered the Basilica looking absurd.  Unfortunately, I did not see the Pontif, but it was still sweet.  Other highlights included going to the Coliseum and repeating the same lines from Gladiator over and over, making jokes about "Trajan's Column", and pondering why tourists would take photos next to the Arch of Titus, which signified the deification of the Emperor Titus, whose major accomplishment was invading and sacking the City of Jerusalem, burning down the Jewish Temple, and pilfering a menorah from the Temple.  The Island of Capri was rich, but NOBODY there had ever heard of Capri Sun, which is weird, because Capri Sun is clearly the best thing ever to emerge from the Island of Capri, if not from Italy herself.
