Watched this TV program, titled 'Ritma Menara' or something like that hosted by Fazlee. It talked about this problem, and graduates and university students give their feedbacks. Some says too choosy, some say lack of right attitude, and lack of skills needed by the industry.  For the last one is true especially in IT industry in Malaysia. I've read in The Star In.Tech Raya Edition that our local IT graduates doesn't even know relatively basic programming languages such as Visual Basic. Heck, even I learned that for SPM and have made a simple program. Even Shahril took one step furher to learn C++.  Back to the TV program, it was Ok. Fazlee is quite a good host. But at the end of the show, they feature university students singing complete with a band. (Apparently it's a band club of one university in KL) Is that the kind of gradutes we want to potray? So many time to waste to practice singing while I've seen my relatives busy finishing assignments each semester break. Heck, do having featured singing in TV have any value in your CV? Unless you apply to be background singer, that's it.   My dad as a lecturer pointed out that's why Malays in universities is still backward. So fond of wasting time, 'gila glamour' and too busy coupling while students from other race are busy studying and meet their lecturers to learn more. May my friends and I will not behave like that in university. Ameen.
