Furthermore, it takes a knight a lot longer to get somewhere than it takes a bishop, rook, or queen.  These are the disadvantages of the knight compared to the other pieces.  But the knight also has one big advantage; it can hop over other pieces.  Once you get the knight close to the action, it doesn't matter whether the squares next to it are occupied or not, it still has the same power.  What can we conclude from these observations?  The knight wants to find a strong square somewhere in the middle of the board or close to some weak spot in the opponent's position, and then the knight wants to sit there.  The knight doesn't care about getting a "clear view" of anything, since it always has the same view no matter what.  But the knight also doesn't want to have to move around too much, because it is so much slower than the other pieces.
