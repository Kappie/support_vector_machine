I love camping :)  We also went to the Gardener Caves and Boundary Dam so I have all kinds of photos that I'll load up once I find a crack for PSP8 :)  Anyhoo - I had some weird ass dream last night.  I was out walking and I wanted to go to 7/11.   I crossed the street and some guy was there and it went something like...  Guy: Where are you going? Me: 7/11 Guy: Oh, well it looks a little dark Me: Thats odd for a 24-hour store...  Then the guy looks at me, jumps me and tell me he is going to rape me.  So I'm freaking out and totally struggling against him and trying to scream but I don't seem to have a voice.  We end up wrestling down the street or something and I finally get this string to choke him but I still can't scream and people are just walking by doing nothing.  I'm trying to tell this guy in a drive-through window to call 9-1-1 but I can't yell so he can't understand me.  I kick the assailant in the head and start to run, but he recovers real quick and easy and comes after me.  But then I wake up.  WTF was that???  Dreaming about rape?  Damn.  Brutal.  Sucky night!  Let's see what the dream dictionary (www.swoon.com) has to say about this:   Rape : Whatever form it took in your dream, this act is a warning to avoid loose companions or careless behavior that could seriously damage your reputation by giving a false impression to those whose opinions are important to your welfare.    Fight : The basic meaning in a dream of fighting is change. For a business person, it signifies a change of enterprise; for an employed person, a change of job, etc. The degree of success or failure you may expect from the change was forecast in the outcome of your dreamed fight. If your dream concerned others fighting, it is a warning against waste of time and money in idle pleasure.   Laryngitis : To dream of losing your voice is a warning not to gamble or take any unnecessary risk for the next few weeks.  Well isn't that fun?  Sounds like a lot of warnings and a big flag that change is coming.  Whee!  Tell me something I  don't  know.  Stuff, bye.
