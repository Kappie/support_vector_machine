Name: Hannah Current Age: 20 Current Residence: Springfield, MO Loves: Music, British accents, musicians with British accents Dislikes: Wide-eyed sycophants willing to do anything in order to be accepted by their peers Dreams: Of being a rock star Interests: Music, art, writing Favourite movie/s: Gattaca Favourite band/s or musician/s: U2, Radiohead, Coldplay, Muse, Eisley Favourite genre of music: Genres suck. I don't categorize my music. The world tries to lump Radiohead into the same category as Nickelback. That's why I turn the "Genre" feature off in iTunes.

Favourite game/s: I like Scrabble. Personal/Favourite Quote: "You've got to change the world and use this chance to be heard. Your time is now."
