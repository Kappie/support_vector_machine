The day will be known as:    The Day I met my Goddes .       urlLink     Sarah McLachlan urlLink         July 12 - 2004   6.00 am.     I woke up tired, but excited, Saturday and Sunday had too many emotions for me. Never the less today was the day. But what a day, It was Hot, extremely hot. I took a shower and got ready to hit the road. As I was loading the car, I remembered to call Linda. She was done and ready, just waiting for me to pick her up.      8.30 am.     The Highway. The plan? Get to San Diego, spend some time on Mission and Fashion Valley; go visit Alejandra at around four and finally Sarah's concert at eight. It was a nice trip. We were chatting and gossiping... Nothing new with us... Well! For you to find out.      9.30 am.     Mission. Damn! It was horrible... Hot, humid, did I mentioned hot? I almost die. I am ok with a hot day, but I hate to sweat. Anyway we got there and started looking around. Too many nice things, too many expensive things. It's really funny how much Linda and I are the same when it comes to shop. We look for clothes that are made for winter, and then, not buying much, we move to check Macy's and Robinsons' 3rd floor [ home ] and get really excited with bed sheets, knifes, rugs, etcetera. How gay am I?   Anyway, by 10.30 in the morning we were already tired and sleepy. We did not feel ok on how fresh and clean we were. But we still had a long day ahead of us.      12.30 pm.     We decided to leave Mission and check out Fashion Valley. I don't know how the hell we endure the day. I don't like to get tanned, she does neither.   We looked almost every shop in FV, but it was heaven the moment we stopped at Macy's and the girl started to look for shoes... I just sat there thinking and resting. I don't know what happened then 'cause my mood went down the hill at that moment. Linda looked at me and sat next to me.  "What's going on?"  -she asked-  "Why the face? You look sad, ok, what's going on?"  I did not know what to say. I kinda knew what was going on... Anyway.      4.15 pm.     Now we were REALLY tired. Really, really tired. We got out of AF without buying a thing... Do I need a sweater at the moment? I think not... My throat hurted and we were hungry. Is at this point of remembering that I cringe. I remember muttering my discomfort and almost making way to the car and back home, WITHOUT seeing the Concert. Oh my God!  "Let's call Alejandra, I'm hungry"  -Linda said.  "Ok"  -I answered.    "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "There's no answer"  -Linda said.   "Let's go over there. Worse come to worse, she's not there and we have to make time till the concert"  -I said-  "Sigh!"    "Ok"  -Linda.      4.30 pm.      "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Knock, Knock"  .................................... silence!   "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Ding; Knock, Knock; Dong"  ...... ........... silence!    "Did she knew we were coming? Did you call her?"  -Linda asked.   "Yeah, I called her last week."  -I answered-  "She must've leave with her husband to work. She might be here in a few minutes."  -I said.   "Let's go eat, I'm starving. We can come back latter!"  -she said.   "Ok. Just let me leave a message, in case she can join us!"  -I said.   So I wrote a message and as I was looking for a place to leave it, so the wind wouldn't blow it, I notices that the door was kinda loose. Linda was looking to the other side but she remembered something and turned and said " Maybe the door is open"  ... she grabbed the knob and pushed the door open... My heart sank!   There I was, knealing in front of the door and staring inside the apartment. There was nothing. It was empty. She moved and did not say a thing, and I was thirsty and hungry! Linda is more relaxed, she pointed the obvious:  "I knew this was not the building! It's the next!"       4.55 pm.      "Ding, Dong"  ........................................  "I thought you were not coming!"  -Alejandra said-  "It's late!"     Damn it was hot inside the apartment. I almost faint inside. Alejandra was all tanned and ready to leave for the pool.      urlLink     It was hot that day! urlLink       She made us something to eat and spent some quality time together. I kept looking [ according to Linda and Alex ] rather sad and depressed. I drank so much water that I gave the impresion of being hang over.      6.55 pm.      "It may be time for us to leave"  -Linda said.
