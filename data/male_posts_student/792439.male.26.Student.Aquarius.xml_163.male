The trade is negotiated between the elite, upper class, who dwell in space stations orbiting the planet; and the workers below, by trade guilds located strictly and permanently on the surface.  A massive spider web of rail lines, encased in protective glass tubes, stretch across the countryside. At the center of the hub is a towering elevator/railway, also encased in protective glass, leading into the sky. It reaches up through the atmosphere as a means of supplying the elite with finished products of their precious resources. At the bottom of this tube are factories used to process the resources. The railways ship raw minerals and such from outlying mines and farms to this location..." now take a look at this:   urlLink curse you, NASA!  i am a little discouraged, even though this is not central to the plot. by the time my finished story comes out, that concept might seem unoriginal.
