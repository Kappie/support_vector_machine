Apparently, the meaning of life is: "taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual." That's it. Just read my post and skip the book.      I went to guitar lessons today. I started to learn "Panama" by Van Halen. If you haven't heard it (which is unlikely if you are a rock fan), you need to. The only problem is that my instructor, Travis, will be gone next week so I can't learn the rest of it for two weeks. Plus, the tabs on the Internet for this song don't follow his method. Let's see...what would Frankl have me do? I have to take the responsibility to find the right answer...I've got it. I sit on my ass and weep for two weeks. Thank you Viktor, you are the coolest German, Jewish logotherapist I know.      That's all for now. I'll be back tomorrow.
