But this post is mainly to inform about how I will post @ Eps from now on. I just got my TR hat but i also lost all my music files from my PC which means I had to start from scratch so I have about an equal abundance (for now) of older CDs and newer CDs. So my plan is to review one newer CD and then one older one and so on and so forth. I'm doing this so I don't review all my new CDs and then be stuck with older cds to review that no one will look at. (Nobody really paid attention to my TWEET review). So just expect that from me from now on. If I review an older CD, stick with me cuz a new one is coming. And to all members that look at this post, go check my Tweet review if u haven't done so. That is all for now.
