Anyway yesterday training was crap, lost to Daniel Chan 1 piece up, i dun believe it...and so dun wan to blog. Anyway, was depressed this morning, but not anymore now, refer to my chatlog wif solomon for the reason. Sigh, go back to school again, ah well, it was inevitable i suppose...Hope no-one finds this accidentally, i will only reveal this when im ready to do so. Hay my typing speed seems to have improved! Im so pro...(haha, this is probably the most stupid blog u have eva seen, I can't seem to stay on topic tonite). See u again another time, perhaps.
