Went to the opening evening tonight and, to tell the truth, it was simply  astounding ,  amazing , and  brilliant .  This really is no understatement.  To quote the blurb on the program:  " Hang on Mr. Bugson  was originally conceived as a play which would have no plot, no particular characterisation, no nothing, except for theatre.  In the end, that didn't happen.  Instead, it became something of an experiment.  Ralegh calls it 'meta-drama', YaZz calls it 'a paradoxically humorous exploration into the morality of the tragic writer', I call it a giant philosophical self-indulgence.   One thing is clear: it smudges the boundaries between what is funny and what is sad.  In an age where comedy ranges from standard punning to playing 'It's Raining Men' on a film of the burning twin towers, no tragic moment seems entirely beyond laughter."  What more can I say?  The play is simply one every Wykehamist must make an effort to see.  You will not be disappointed.     Message: If you haven't seen it DO!
