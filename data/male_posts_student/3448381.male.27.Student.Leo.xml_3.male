Also, you have to drive past 3 trailers that epitomize "Appalachia" with cars up on blocks, confederate flag flying, etc." -Lady I emailed about renting her house in Blacksburg, Virginia.  This is a direct quote from an email I just received not too long ago and so it occurred to me that I wanted to ponder on "this here move" to Virginia (bad grammar intended).    I do have all the stereotypes in my head of barefooted, overall-wearing, strawhat-wearing, no teeth-having, inbred, southern drawl, racist, huckleberry finns named bubba.  Or debutantes named Peggy Sue with golden curls in a pink dress sipping on lemonade on a swinging bench on her daddy's porch which is at the front of the house that used to be the master's quarters of a plantation.  However, I think I lean more to the hillbilly vision because we are close to the Appalachian mountains.  "Dares gold in dem dare hills!!"  Then my logical mind says that this of course is a stereotype and that people won't actually be that way.  But being on the other end of stereotypes, I can tell you that they come from somewhere. There is truth behind it.  So while most people won't be that way, I am sure to run into buba at some point.    My other fear is the opposite.  I also vision the campus of VTech to be filled with young peple from many different places.  Open minds and eager to learn.  Where in the hell did I get that vision?  Do I not remember college?  My fear is I'll be at a party at Hemingway or Mass Ave all over again.  Retard college kids pounding drinks and yelling at the top of thier lungs.  That, inded, is what college is all about.  However, I am on a mission.  I'll probably try and segregate myself from that community which leaves just a grad community where we go to each other's houses with our spouses and have wine instead of beer.  We talk of post-modernism and smoke fine cigars.  But after a while I'll probably want to make cock jokes and chug a beer with some one who understands about HipHop and Platanos.  So I'll segregate myself again.  Maybe at the end of my stay, it'll boil down to just me, Jose, and Leroy enjoying some Buffalo wings and some beer while we watch the George Lopez Show followed by Dave Chapelle.    And what about my studies?  On my way to work today I found myself remembering the times I would sit in the NU library, ready to get some serious work done and then taking a "ten minute" nap to really feel refreshed.  How wrong was that?  Then, during the middle of a really tough calculus 4 problem (which I took twice), I would stop to day dream.  Looking out the window and day dream.  Wondering why this problem was so relevant to my life.  Why wasn't I doing something that I actually cared about.  I didn't care about gradients.  That's what this whole move is about.  Non-gradient, non derivative, non boolean work.    Once while I was drunk at one of the Senior Banquets, I spoke to one of our professor's and he said watching TV is like eating McDonald's, while doing his academic work was like eating Filet Mignon.  I'm tired of my McDonald's diet.  This whole thing is about Love. Knowledge. And Everything in Between.  Peace,  Chaunsee
