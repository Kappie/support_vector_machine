Anyways, yesterday was Friday and I hung out with Heaton and his brother and went to Guitar Center. Played the electric drum set, fun! Today I hung out with Ricky and Paul in the morning, then went to to Cory's for an Aftermath band practice, then went to my cousin's (Troianos) house. It was grand. We found some bird that couldn't fly good so we helped it fly. It flew. We also found Mr. Softee, what a delight, milk shakes for all. Mr. Softee is the best ice cream on Planet Earth. Remember when we were kids and we used to say Planet Earth. Good times I tell ya. The fireworks and cop sirens were swarming the peaceful quiet sounds of the atmosphere. It was fun watching all the explosions all around us. Princess meets Officer Friendly. Woo I actually made this blog before midnight, go me. Yea uh...that's all. Tomorrow should be a good traditional go to the cousin Murphy's fourth of a July. Billy bought some crackaz and the guys down the street have good ones too. It shall be extruvious. Oh yea, report cards came today. I did awesome. Since the colleges only look at final averages, regents and finals I lucked out. I got all A's and B's for final averages, mostly A's. Regents, Math A - 94, Living Environment - 85, Global - 97, Italian - 91. How awesome is that. I'm set for life. But I am pissed because my fucking Studio In Media Arts teacher gave me a C for the quarter because I couldn't make a panda. I tried hard and worked hard to make it and that's all that counts. It's not my fault I don't have good artistic skills, you're not allowed to grade someone on their artistic skills that's fucking bullshit. Ah who the fuck cares, art's for either homos, depressed emo faggets, or just normal kids who kick ass at art...and I'm none of them. And she put needs to participate more, more effort needed. BULLSHIT!!! That teacher's gonna get fired and that class is being taken out. The principal kept monitoring the class and I bet he realized the class has no educational value. So bye bye Mrs. McManus, YOU'RE FIRED!!! Ok, so besides Studio In Media Arts which doesn't matter because my final grade was a B+, everything on my report card was woopty doo! That's all, goodbye.
