Overly careful about how he appears on the screen in public,  Schwarzenegger  will allow continued production to flow from the  Ohio Discount Merchandise Inc.  company, but the bobble heads will feature no gun. On sale for $19.99 (Internet sale only), some proceeds may go to the  Arnold All-Stars  after school program, which is based in Los Angeles. Obviously angered by the original production of the somewhat stereotypical dolls,  Schwarzenegger  stated a desire to maintain his head-bobbing in other places, like when he’s below Fabio’s waist.
