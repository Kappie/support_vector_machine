The primary concern is terror, and that trumps all else.  Bush will get my vote for that.  But, if 9/11 had never happened, and Bush had ran the domestic side as he is now, I would be howling mad and would likely not vote at all.  I am seriously angry at him for so many things, such as the education bill, the drug bill, the amnesty, and the continued expansion of programs and spending.  It is maddening to think that a republican is signing on to these programs, but his father was no better.  I understand the political realities in this country.  Bush's polls track low when it comes to domestic issues.  The nation as a whole prefers Democrats when it comes to social concerns.  I think that is a failure to educate voters rather than a true desire for socialism, but more on that later.  People want handouts.  THey want us to take money from one group and give it to them.  The reality is, you can't be elected if you don't steal from others.  So Bush is doing what any other good politician would do - he is going to start with the handouts in exchange for votes.  At this point in our history, I have to hold my nose and accept it as the price for keeping a vigorous war on terror going.  There's no purity in politics.  It's why I spent the first five years of my political awareness angry and bitter, wanting the Gingrich revolution to gut the government down to nothing.  The political trades that were made were a bitter lesson, but that's the way of things.  People want handouts.  Dealing with the Federal Government is like being assaulted.  You get bruised and battered, and you count yourself fortunate if all you have are a few broken ribs rather than a bashed in skull.  Watching the SOTU speech is like experiencing another assault.  You're just waiting on it to end, and hoping that there isn't too much damage done.  The Democrats have us beat on social issues because of the way the argument has been framed.  Who can deny funding education, helping the elderly, cushioning the blow of unemployment, helping train workers, assuring a retirement and so on.  On the surface those things sound so innocent.  Stand in the way, and perforce you are wanting to let people suffer, starve children and smother grandpa with a pillow.  The text of the argument never goes to the deeper issue of self-sufficiency, the moral obligation to keep the money you make, and the long term effects of a dependency based society.  We can never talk about creating more opportunity, or allowing people to have more control of their lives.  Just 'kill grandpa' and 'starve chilrun'.    People aren't willing to engage the deeper philosophical differences between the party.  So the Democrats win because they have the 'shallow' high ground.  Thus we have to create handouts for votes.  So while the SOTU had some great points on the War on Terror, overall, I'm just happy to walk away under my own power.
