There are about 5 of them, and I want them all!  And I'm downloading them all as we speak.  I hope that I can complete it, the one seed that is in the swarm isn't connecting to me.  I hope one of my peers becomes a seed soon.     In other anime news, I also found a torrent link for Ayashi No Ceres, a series that a friend has read, and since she recomended it, I'll watch it!  Did I mention how much I love Bittorrent?  It has downloaded all that is good on this computer, and will continue to do a good job.      I just found out today that I have a job to do for about a week, in 2 weeks.  Yup, I'll be making around 125 for the week, not to bad, at around 3 hours a day.  I get to run games for the kids at my church.  How fun.  Lets just hope they aren't wild.  Well, lets just say I'm doing this job for the Lord, not for the money or anyone else.  The money is just a bonus I'm getting.      And how welcome that bonus is.  That means that I have more money to spend at CNAnime which is comming up in 3 short weeks, according to my knowlege.  That is going to amazingly fun.  Well, Azumanga is calling to me, time to watch!    Lates
