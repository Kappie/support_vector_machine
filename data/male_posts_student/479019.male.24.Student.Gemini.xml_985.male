Guttermouth's lead singer Mark has some  urlLink stuff to say  about those punk kids with mohawks and stuff. I think he points out some good stuff, but not in an as entertaining manner as when he was one stage.  My radio transmitter is in NY... grrr.... apparently when one changes your billing address on Amazon.com, it doesn't automatically change your shipping address.  I don't think I'll be going to many shows for the rest of the summer... well except Stiff Little Fingers and the Damned.  **
