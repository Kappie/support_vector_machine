This college project we have to do in clark's is actually going to be very useful.  Well, if I follow it anyways.  I think I will though, I've already applied for scholarships that I would have never done if not for this project, and I Think I'm going to make it my summer goal to apply for at least 10 a month.  Get what I can out of scholarship money.  I also like the idea of applying to every school that is free to apply to across the country, just to make them all compete over me.  Anyways, I'm going ot bed.  I Need the sleep. ~CT
