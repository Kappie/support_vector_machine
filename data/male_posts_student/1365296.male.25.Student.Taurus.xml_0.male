I can't watch the actual contest itself because listening to people sing the kind of stuff they have on the show pisses me off to no end.  I find it one of the most annoying things in this godforsaken world.  I want to kill people who sing out loud in front of people or sing to themselves or sing on talent shows like American Idol.  So why do I watch?  The morons that get up there and think they can sing.  Now there are those who actually think they can sing, but can't.  I rank it as one of those mysteries of the universe that will make your head implode like the Witch King if you think about it too long.  But some of the others that get up there I can't figure out.  Do they really think they can sing, or are they purposefully trying to make fools of themselves?  The world may never know.  The same thing with  Last Comic Standing .  I find this show the best of the talent reality shows.  But the audition process is amazing.  The people who audition for  American Idol  are trying to be goofy and funny.  Same thing with  Last Comic Standing .  Which begs the question, "Do they really think they are funny?"  Some of them are just acting like jackasses.  Then there are those who really think they are funny.  Its really sad because they are wasting their lives.  I know I'm funny, but only in small crowds of friends.  But this does not make me a stand-up comic.  And some of these people have said that they got into this due to winning talent shows.  NO!  This does not mean you are stand-up comic material.  Just because a small group of idiots who couldn't see talent if it walked in wearing a flashing neon sign, doesn't mean you are funny.  Ahh, the delusions of grandeur.
