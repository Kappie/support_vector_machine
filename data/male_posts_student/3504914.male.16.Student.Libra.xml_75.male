The 'You Stupid Bastard' one xD   This new blog currently consists of myself and Alec, and hopefully others in the future. The main goal of the blog is to write articles on whatever we feel like, as opposed to the whole point of these individual blogs where the main purpose is to inform others on our own lives.  As you can already see there, i've bastardised American Culture and written a preview review of GTA: SA.   If you are interested in joining our team, leave a comment in the latest entry in You Stupid Bastard, and i'll try and decide whether I want you in the team.  Obviously the requirements are high xD An at least average grasp of the English language and the ability to humour people.  That's all.   I'm bored.
