WallaceHQ would be here, and I would have a link going back over to freewebs/geocities and all my other blogs and they would each link back to this blog.  I would probably rename this blog to "A Geek's Life HQ" or something like that and give a little intro information about myself, etc. (Yes I would actually include my profile this time)...  Hmmm.... decisions....  Feedback.  Please.
