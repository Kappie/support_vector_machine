I would love to just write the same thing over and over again, It'd just be so easy, but I couldn't. There's just too many of them. I mean, in math class I signed three. As in, I was carrying around three yearbooks that were NOT mine. Ugh. Well I need to get my muscles toned anyway. By the way, my broskey is on quest and we all need to help him out.       All you need to understand this quest is to watch Rushmore and you'll understand how she is the most underappreciated actress ever. By the way, what the hell is up with the actor/actress thing nowadays?? I always thought men were supposed to be called actors and women were supposed to be called actresses and it was this way for a long time. Until those utterly stupid feminists came along. It was feminists who came up with the idea that actresses should "break down the borders" and call themselves actors. The stupidest thing about it is that they're pretty much saying (and this isn't my opinion) that men are superior so lets try and live up to them by calling ourselves the same thing they call themselves. Ugh. When I do meet an utterly repulsive feminist I will force myself to say hi to her and then say something completely insensitive about women towards her. Yes, I will go out of my way to do it.  A while back I signed up to get a couple free issues of HOW, a graphic design magazine. It's a very cool magazine and if I had the money I would subscribe to it and the other magazines that are affiliated with it. Since I liked it so much, I signed up for the newsletter. Signing up for a newsletter is something I rarely do since they are all usually very unprofessional and crappy. But this one is unusually good. Try it out here (http://www.howdesign.com/newsletter.asp). So, I was reading through the latest issue and I was reading through the editor's note who was highly reccomending that everyone who was reading check out this website made by and about Keri Smith (http://www.kerismith.com/). I checked it out and it was really cool. I printed out some stuff in my business class just to waste paper again but I haven't gone through it yet.  Finally came up with a short story to write about. Well kind of. I'm very unusual when it comes to writing, if you can't already tell. I find that inspiration does not strike me in the form of plot but in the form of characteristics. Like with this story, every character will have a title and not a name except for the protagonist and his lover. So there'd be the protagonist, Bradley, and Suzanna, his lover, whereas everyone else would be The Mailman, The Waitress, The Ex-Girlfriend, etc. I'm doing this in an attempt to create massive indifference for all of the characters and then leave the reader caring for the characters who actually have names. So far the protagonist's name is Bradley. I don't like the name Bradley and I'm sure other people do too so if you have any suggestions please reply to this post.
