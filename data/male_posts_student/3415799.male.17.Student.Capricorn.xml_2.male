I was shocked at the time that she left so sudden as we had been close friends for a good long stretch...and we still are. I'm leaving academy next week and we are still in good healthy contact. I haven't seen Kim in a while now, it was two years this summer since I last seen her. Kim is lovely, she has one of those personalities that just make you want to absorb it all at once and explode with joy. You know what I mean ? Although  I only seen Kim for a few hours that day we just sat and talked and it was amazing how we could just pick up from where we last left off in a letter or a phone call.  If I love one thing in life its being able to write, I just love how one can store a thought in a few words or perhaps many, I suppose its a bit like how when one hears a piece of music and it just seems to describe everything that one feels at that moment or a previous experience. Although I'm still in good contact with Kim and I enjoy every moment we spend together or reading, writing letters...a few months ago I had a feeling that I wanted to have an international relationship, so I set up a profile in the hope that I would get some responses from people in different places in the world, and I did. A few weeks later Lynna e-mailed me from Singapore and we just seem to have clicked. I know people will think that this can't be good and she's only in it for a visa but it really is nothing like that, we are just great friends. She loves going to the movies and she studies media at university, actually she graduates this week. Although I haven't as much as smelled Lynna I just know that communicating with her whether it be through the internet or snail mail I know that I have a friend that I can always relate to. I guess I've been lucky in the friendship department, so what I'm trying to say is no matter where you have a friend whether it be a mile away or five thousand, they're still your friend and knowing that just brings that person straight to you and that is an amazing feeling that I don't think I could compromise for anything.
