This seems to be taking place in the afternoons for several hours  (umm no! not hours) .  I am currently revising  bla dee bla de bla..  as a fellow neighbour I would appreciate it if you could lower the volume of the music, I am finding they are disturbing my concentration which in turns make it diffucult to revise.   Regards No.12.  -Well must of been pretty loud if he could hear it from there. I was listening to the Chillis!
