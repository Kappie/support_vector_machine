This city has seen some pretty memorable drunkenbrawls in years past, it's full of Irish after all, and who knows more about pointless violence than the Irish? Wasn't there evena massacre here once? Listen, alls I'm asking for is maybe afist fight, a knife fight, maybe even a cat fight. Two nicotine starved delegates getting in each others faces on the way to the sidewalk for a quick smoke, or, better yet, Elizabeth Edwards and Teresa Heinz-Kerry go at on stage, that would go a long way to wining the Kerry the Professional Wrestling Fan vote, though, on the other hand, wrestling superstar The Rock is a staunch Republican and he has a lot of clout with the Mullet Wearers of America. Democrats are the nasty ones, why the all of a sudden with the niceness? Have they all of a sudden realised that nobody in their party has a personality any different than an IBM XT and that tends to, oh, alienate the voting public?
