The study included more than 35,000 thousand students from a number of states. "Students were not able to answer simple questions," said Prof. Jackson Bills, "even those pretaining to their own country." Howevever, several teachers' unions claim that the study was flawed. "Some students did not get the full alloted time because then arrived late," said one teacher. The students were reportedly unable to find their testing classroom despite hallway signs. Oxford says that it stands by its study.  The study found that 54% of students failed to identify Afghanistan on the map, and a shocking 74% thought Vietnam is an island in the North Atlantic. 3% of students misidentified Canada on the map, however, teachers say that the students simply were not able to find the appropriate bubble to fill in. "We have observed neglect on the part of the schools to teach even the most basic of geography," the study says. Additionally, only 11% of students were able to locate China on the map. This compares to 95% in England, 99% in Egypt, 88% in Russia, and 79% in Mexico. The complete study is to be released Friday.
