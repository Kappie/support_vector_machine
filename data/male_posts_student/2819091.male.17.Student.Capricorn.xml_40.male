What makes you happy, what angers you... I don't know anything about you. I'd really like to meet you, See you...  Talk to you... Listen to you besides things you have to say here, in this place. I want to know what your type of music is, What games you play, what your interests are... I want to meet you, if you'd let me... Until then...  All I can say to you since I don't know you... Since I don't know what annoys you...  What angers you... What satisfies you...  What contents you... Are these few words that you'll constantly hear: I apologize...  I'm so sorry.
