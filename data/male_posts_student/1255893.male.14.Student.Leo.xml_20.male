It's like nothin' I can do will distract me when I think of how I shot myself in the back again  'cuz from the infinate words I can say I  put all the pain you gave to me on display/but didn't realise, instead of sttin' it free I, took what I hated and made it a part of me.  (it never goes away),(it never goes away) And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here you've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear. I can't separate  myself from what I've done.  I've given up a part of me, I've let myself become you.  Hearin' you're name the memories come back again. I remember when it started happenin'. I'd see you in every thought I had and then, the thoughts slowly found words attached to them.  and I knew as they escaped away I was commitin' myself to em' and every day I regret sayin' those things/'cuz now I see that I,  took what I hated and made it a part of me. (it never goes away),(it never goes away).  And now you've become a part of me. you'll always be right here. You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear. I can't separate /myself from what i've done. I've given up a part of me. I've let myself become you.  get away from (ME) give me my space back you've got to just(GO) everything comes down to memories of(YOU)  I've kept it in but now I'm lettin' you(KNOW) I've let you go.   I've let myself become you. I've let myself become you. I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you. I've given up a part of me,I've let myself become you.                                                                                                   (just so you al know,there will be more lyrics to come in the following days)
