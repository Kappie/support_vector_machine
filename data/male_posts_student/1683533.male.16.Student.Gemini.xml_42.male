He has a very bad eating habit but takes so much drugs that he stays skinny.  And yes his name Shaggy does have a meaning to it...His real name used to be Walter...but now he is a pimp and he sells his bitches right out of the mystery machine...  Daphne- A huge whore...one of Shaggy's more favorite bitches....She will screw for anybody that has money.  She is crawling with herpes and several other STDs from the orgies Shaggy plans in the back of the mystery machine...no that isn't a mole on her face.....and lets just say she is so used up she can't keep her legs crossed....  Freddy-A raging homosexual...he wears a neckercheif, isnt that enough to prove it?.....and his lover is the guest star Robin, Batman's sidekick...When they join forces to solve a mystery they usually end up...well...y'know....  Velma- Nobody is really sure if Velma is a girl or a boy...only Shaggy knows cause when he is messed up he screws anything that moves...She needs glasses cause one time she got maced when approaching a lady for directions while the gang was stuck in the middle of nowhere...which is where they always seem to be...."Jinkies!" really means "Holy shit!" in Velmanese...  And finally the dog himself...  Scooby Doo- is Scooby Doo real?  Why, yes he is an actual dog that goes along with the kids on their trips...he was raised by Shaggy when found abondened on the streets...Shaggy hoped Scooby could provide protection that was need to live in the world of hookers and drugs...Can scooby talk? Nooooo....Scooby talking is only a hallucination the gang has when they use too much LSD...  The monsters- all LSD hallucinations  Well...that's the truth behind Scooby Doo....I may find more on this scandal later...  "You You You Yooou You You You Yoooou without me." -Squirtgun
