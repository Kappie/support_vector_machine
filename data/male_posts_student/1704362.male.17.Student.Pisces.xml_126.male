Right now the two colleges that are really interesting me are University of Chicago and Rice University in Texas.  I also found the most kick-ass scholarship ever... the  urlLink National Security Agency  offers full-ride scholarships each year for Math, Engineering, and Foreign Languages, as long as you agree to work for them for a few years after college as an Intelligence Analyst. Hell, I'd want to work for the NSA even if they didn't give me a scholarship.  I might need to eliminate all independent thought before I submit to be a tool of the Man, though.
