A lot of people are taking it as a shock but many people had already known that. My sister's friend is a cop and last year he caught McGreevey parked under a bridge with another man... so you can only use your imagination as to what they were doing. I personally find this whole thing extremely funny. I even collected some of the news from the web sites and archived them. After all, it's not everyday that your governor admits he's gay and resigns to put his life in order. If you want to look at these articles, I have them right  urlLink here  (you must have a Windows computer to view them). But on the serious side, I do think that he did the right thing, even if it  was  for the wrong reason (he only did it because his lover wanted money to keep quiet). We are always saying we need good politicians that don't lie to us and he was very frank about it and admitted everything. I don't know why he resigned though. He said something to the effect of so that he can work this out with his family. One thing is for sure: if he ever ran for something again, I would probably vote for him because of his honesty. He could have denied everything even if his lover did exploit him. He had a lot of courage to do what he did. And I commend him for that. (still, it doesn't mean I don't find it a little funny  )
