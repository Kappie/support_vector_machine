(like I said before) Its like a dream come through for anybody who wishes to restart his life all over again...  Wishes fufilled, dreams framed... My life would never be the same...  For frens like never before, With wings we will soar....  When they tried to split us up at the Connect event, they apparantly weren't very successful because in the end we still met up and set together.. instinctively.... lol.... what a frustration for them... [aint it?] I think I over-stuffed myself silly at that event.... Dunno why I was feeling so hungry... I ate and ate.. so much.... ugh.... Haha...  But I think the music that they played at that event wasnt exectly very good.... in fact... *snigger* haha... nvm....  I love all my frenz... and I hope I can be with them forever and ever.... really... especially my 2 close frens Timothy and Jason.... We kinda click really well and we talk a hell lot.... haha.... sigh....  Today we presented out CC presentation Le Potato Aardvark de Ghost... a hilarious joke of a cook book... but still all the more entertaining...   I juz came back from eating with them after watching a pretty spectacular performance by the strings enssamble... It is really not easy for them to coordinate in a concert hall......... but still they played rather well...  Hope that God really will take care of them and bless them.... =)  They're my great friends!!  What am I thinking now: Err... Le Potato Aardvark de Ghost? LOLz!!!
