It all started after school in Friday when Mike K and I got picked up at school and then we went to my house to get packed for the snowboarding trip. We got packed and headed out the door, to snowshoe!  First Mike K and I did some of our home work, until the sun went down. Then everyone in the car (Mike K, my dad, Mike, Greg, and I) except for my mom played a drama type game where one person says one word and then the next person says another word and so on. The story we made was:    We then sat back and slept for the rest of the trip (except for my dad who had to drive). We got there and watched South Park, the episode where Chef's parents talk about the lock ness monster, grand indeed. After that fucking awesome episode we went to bed.  The next morning my parents and Mike go and get their rental gear, and then we were ready to head down the mountain. Mike and I decided to go to the terrain park (jumps and crap). There was this big jump that I decided to jump off of, I underestimated its size and messed up my ankle. I slowed down just before I went off and landed really hard on my left ankle. It was really hard for me to do a right turn, but eventually got used to the pain.  Mike and I got to the bottom and ate some waffles, then back up the mountain. We actually decided to go to the other mountain (silver creek) because they have a better terrain park. Mike and I spent the rest of the day there working on some tricks.  We got home and ate some dinner then headed out to “teen night,” which is a cheap way to get teenagers to spend their money (totally kicked ass). The girls were all up onz me... Sorta. We then went home and fell asleep.  We then woke up and I had no more pain in my ankle, then we went to silver creek. We did more tricks and got a whole lot better. Now Mike and I can do: Indy, Mute, Stale-fish, Roast beef, stand still 180, stand still shifty, 50-50, and board slide (just cant finish it without busting our tailbones on the rail).  And the best part was the trip home. We got packed and took everything down to the car, loaded it up and got in. My dad tried to start the car but was unsuccessful. My brother then said “Maybe the battery is frozen.” Every on in the car cracked up. So we (Mike K, Mike, and I) teased Greg about it. Then Mike K then said sarcastically to Greg, “My shoe doesnt fit any more, maybe it’s frozen!” Then Greg said “Actually that could happen.”  Again we cracked up. We got the car fixed (kind of) and then drove off. It started to snow hard and we decided to pull over to some random Virginia hick hotel.  The next morning we were off and a few later the car broke down again because of the batteries. So Mike K, Mike, Greg, and I, went to CVS so we can buy a magazine and maybe a DVD. Greg and Mike bought a DVD and then wanted to stay in the store, but the bitchy store clerk yelled at them because they are teenagers and have a bag to which they can steel stuff with. It was actually a very funny thing to watch.  My parents got a new battery, so we then headed home… and now Im here… typing this.  Funny Quotes:  Mike (Greg’s friend)- “West Virginia is a different state?! Im sorry, Im from Canada.”  My dad- “I once had a car…” (he was about to start a story, then my brother said) Greg-“You had a car!?”  El Fin (or la?)
