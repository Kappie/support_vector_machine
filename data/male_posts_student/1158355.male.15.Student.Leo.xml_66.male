Wow, the band concert was tonight, we were awesome, especially the ending Star and Stripes. I went to Carvel. After school, I couldn't go to track because of the concert and how much homework I had. I finished my homework and played a little bit of the new game I got, Enter The Matrix. That's awesome too. Now that I didn't go to track today, I can't attend the Fresh/Soph meet tomorrow... YES!!! Meno Male... or is it Mica Male... Thank god? Which one!?! Ok, you must see the matrix... go now, so see it before your life gets too boring. Nice hot black girls dancing  naked . Yesh, yesh, that wush shza fun pot. Ok goodnight.
