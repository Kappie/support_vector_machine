I need to do some goddamn work, that college stuff...Fried called the worksheet garbage, so I need to give him some pretty bs, so he can give the colleges some pretty bs. Then we'd all be covered in pretty bs and we'd smile b/c the bs, while smelly, is pretty and well-smeared.   What's Faulkner?    ILTRCOMA - On My Wall  Well you're all up on my wall you coat the inner layers of my mind in my head you're mine and mine alone in my head you're my only model  you're all my pin-ups you're all my autographs you're all my pin-ups I've got every single shot  God is a murderer (He'll kill you if he gets a chance) (x8)  He doesn't hesitate to kill he doesn't care if its in his will I'm here to stop him 'cause you're all my pin-ups on my wall...  God is a murderer (He really likes to kill) (x8)    I'm Deadinside...I can't make complete senten  "Its in our nature to take apart eachother's brains, then pick off the little discrepencies we noticed, smoothing them out, and making us so plain, we can understand eachother in our own ways, little ways. My brain's very smooth, I'm very ape"
