There's soo many funnies from today...but I'll put in the best.  RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy: Mrs. Sustic isn't the most observant teacher, apparently...as Matt got away with talking really loud, saying strings of the following words to Anton: "You motherf*cking c*nt, b*tchwh*re, shut the f*ck up." Sustic was only 7 feet away, and he got away with it (!?!).  Social: Same-old, I missed a few points on the test, bleh bleh.  A few musical notes: Relient K-the band that's going to be added to my fav band list soon. Jimmy Eat World-their album rocks! people should check it out. Bleed American is probably one of the best, if not the best song on there, but I'll close with a double-shot.  "There's no one in town I know You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might get one more chance. What would you think of me now, so lucky, so strong, so proud? I never said thank you for that, now I'll never have a chance. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. So what would you think of me now, so lucky, so strong, so proud? I never said thank you for that, now I'll never have a chance. May angels lead you in.  Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. And if you were with me tonight, I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, god wouldn't let it live. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in."  -"Hear you me"  "Hey, don't write yourself off yet. It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on. Just try your best, try everything you can. And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle, it'll up the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. Hey, you know they're all the same. You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in. Live right now. Yeah, just be yourself. It doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. Hey, don't write yourself off yet. It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on. Just do your best, do everything you can. And don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright. It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride. Everything will be just fine, everything will be alright."  -"The Middle"  Well, I'm off to enjoy all this sunshine.
