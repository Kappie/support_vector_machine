It was just a harmless phonecall.  It was their little one. Only he wasn't little anymore. It was quite obvious that he wasn't. They didn't care because he was always little to them. That alarmed him. It was no use, he would always be little.  It wasn't just a harmless phonecall. The only reason he called was to say goodbye. It was then that he took his life. They didn't care because he was their little one And thier little one would never do such a thing. It was no use, he would always be little in their eyes. At least in the morning they would realize that it hadn't been just a harmless phonecall.   A poem by me
