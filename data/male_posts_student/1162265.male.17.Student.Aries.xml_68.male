That'll really suck, I'm starting to hate going on family vactions for weeks on end now.  Even though, I'll have loved wasting my spring break when I return.    Spanish was great today, so somehow it cleared my mind.  We were working on our scrips today, and then Mrs. Lawrence came over, so I started talking about "La Partido de Independencia de Puerto Rico" or something like that.  She thought that was pretty funny, but sort of ignored me until I started talking about  La Brujah  who is a Latina poet.  She knew all about her, and was pretty happy to hear that.  Then we continued to work on trudging through our god-awful long script.  Weird.  Then comes math, where everyone is convinced that I have no social life, which is partly true.  It was pretty funny, because I sped through my homework at Lunch and Mrs. Mastellone was pretty pissed about that and I don't think she gave me credit.  Then she got pissed at me for talking.  That was pretty annoying, but I guess that's pretty normal for me.  And to add to all this Israelis are coming into our history class tommorow.  Second year I get to do this jazz, I should wear some Un-PC shirt, but alas, I have none.
