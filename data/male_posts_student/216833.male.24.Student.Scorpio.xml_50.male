I havn't been bitten, but they just fly around, buzzing in and out my space. I keep wanting to leave my water can out on the patio, but I am worried that it will become a breeding ground for more virus-like bugs.    My plants are doing good, I brought them in last night.  Just a little worried about the high winds and possible turrents of rain, I didn't want the little fellows beaten to death. On monday, I looked at the weather report and there was a thunderstorm forecast every day of the week.  We are still waiting on those thunderstorms.  My luck, the fucking clouds will wait until next weekend to unload, and there goes the wedding outside.  There is a backup plan, just not near as cool.  Work is boring, very much so and I am very worried I am going to get ripped off by techskills.  Fifteen months can go by quick when you have shit to do.  But I really can't do anything about it by worrying.    What Passion dies so quickly with discouragement.
