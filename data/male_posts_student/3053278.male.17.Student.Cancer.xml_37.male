I predict events in my life and I honestly don't know how to explain them sometimes. All I can piece together is I was in my living room and my father was int he next room. I had my arm around this girl, I kissed her and her lips were like keisha's. We made out for a bit and then I remember being out with my uncle gary and we had guns. Yes very strange,Then I was falling with a sabre in my hand...It didn't make any sense. Then I was going through this metal detector and the next thing I know it was going off and they didn't arrest me or anything they just said I needed my case to get on. I can't think of any type of public transportation that has metal detectors but then allows us to carry guns on board but w/e. It was strange cause I was fencing someone while falling and then I saw glimpses of the mustilli shrine. Then I saw Idris and then It was like he was afraid to say something to me. WTF I don't know why im writing this.
