I wish I never picked it now!  I wish I had followed my instincts and had picked art rather than pick French simply for the fact that I might need it the future, which when I look into now looks highly unlikely as I'm moving to America!    I had my first lesson of Games today for a long while, and it was bloody brilliant!  We played rounders, Greebos vs. Trendies and none other than Mrs. Checketts run the lesson!  She was brilliant, she even got a sweatshirt on for the part and we all had a giggle about it - including her.  Shows how cool she really is   The game was fun, Chris shouted random ICT phrases such as "Data Storage!" every time he hit the ball.  We all made fools of ourselves and made the game really enjoyable.  I can't wait for Games next week    After school I went to Sam's house with Craig and we pranked Kerrang! FM with their own Old Boot sound effects...  urlLink Click Here to Listen!   It was hilarious.  Afterwards, we had to go home but we had hardly turned out of the area when Sam phoned Craig to say that they had phoned back!  They had returned the prank to Sam with the real Old Boot sounds haha!
