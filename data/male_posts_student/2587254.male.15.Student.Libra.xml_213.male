Best wishes...   On a sidenote, I can't feel my arms...  Today, being the first time I did a workout in....almost a month, it was tiring. When I say work out I mean a full one, and not just a few sets of bench. My arms are literally dead right now. Good way to end the day, tonight I won't be staying up late at least....REALLY tired right now.  My day started off at exactly 1054am this morning with a phonecall from Rebecca. She called me 6 minutes before my alarm clock rang, which kind of annoys me. I'm very picky with my sleep. Well so we started planning for today, because I told her I'd go for lunch with her and some other people today. Well in the end, after calling many people, only Rebecca, Jason and I ended up going. Before I left, decided I'd try to call Jenn *promised her I would for her b-day* but got her cell's answering machine, which she would explain doesn't even work. Caught her on MSN though, so wished her well, and off I went to downtown to meet up with Rebecky...  *cell rings* "Hello?" "Joe where are you?" "I can see you...I'm in the minivan apporaching your stop?" "Where?" "Here." "Hmm....OH I SEE YOU. Bye." *click*  Now in downtown, me and Rebecky meet up and then wait for Jason. After the clock struck 1pm, I then tried to call him to see where he was. Apparently he was across the street. Funny part is we could never see one another because 3 phone booths happen to be right in our way. Eventually he shifted though...and "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH there you are" came through the phone. So we met up, and decided to head down to the Palasad for the afternoon.  So we got there, and began to pool, order nachos and pop. I'm horrible at pool, but still managed to win our 9-ball game by sinking the last ball, which was the only ball I sunk haha. Fun times though, some stupid shots, and some pretty cool shots. The nachos were good, and my salad was good too. I'm definitely goin' back there sometime. They have good food, and the games are amusing ^_^. Rebecca playing NASCAR was pretty funny as all you hear are screams and gasps as she struggles to get around the track, almost sideswipping Jason on one REALLY fast pass. Jason then spent the remnants of his tokens on Silent Scope 2, and then we left the place. The bill only came to around $31.40. Not bad for 3 people. Well my salad adds on an extra 7 bucks, plus my tip, so in total....  $39.40 was the total amount we spent there today.  So Jason walked back to his place, while I walked Rebecky to her bus stop. Well, in the end to the London Life building where I got a lift with her also. She isn't exactly very good with directions, not saying I am, but I knew the area better than her so kept watch she didn't get lost haha. So in the end I got a ride from her family, and got home around 4pmish....  Where by then I called Jenn...this time actually getting an answer since I called her house. Apparently I do talk fast, as the first person *probably a parent* that answered the phone didn't know what the heck I was talking about, but eeeeventually I got the message that I talk fast, and slowed ....it....down.....very...... SSSSLLOW. After her almost convincing me that no Jenn existed at the place, and then the person FINALLY understood I said "Jenn" and not some other english word....  "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH you said JENN...Just a minute..."  So eventually got through to her, said our hi's, chatted for a bit, and then went off to drum around for a bit. A whole phone convo summed into half a sentence aren't I brilliant =P. I'm hoping I can improve a lot over the summer, because I'm horrible with fills and stuff right now. I wonder how I'll manage with 3 instruments next year...trombone, piano, and drums...oi.  Ate a bit of stuff, and then headed out to UCC with Marcello to work out. So we got there, balled for a bit for warmup, I'm horrible at ball, and then started to work out.  *2 hours later*  So after the workout, decided to walk home, just chill and talk. Beats driving, and it's more environmentally friendly =). Then after we split up, I started to jog back. I need more stamina...it's horrible. So ran from Platts all the way home basically, and here I am now....  Once again, blogging, chatting, editing the splash page for tenmore.net, and probably going to sleep soon.   Aah almost forgot...Maisie's leavin' for camp in two days or sometin'! Hope she has fun up in the Canadian North...well Northern Ontario...so not-so-North haha.   Did I miss anything in my blog now? Hmm...don't think so =).  'Nites. Ow....arms....BOKAN!....ooow...
