I've managed to get a free weeme this time (It's so unbelievably crappy that you have to pay Â£1.50 for one!) and am well impressed with it - i want that handbag!! lol.. As you can probably tell, it's a pretty crappy bitmap-edit of a screen shot... unfortunately the speech bubble was present so I cudn't replicate the supplied backgrounds if i deleted it... actually, I might edit the image an 'ickle bit more and get rid of the speech bubble, at least then it might fit in msn icon space!  urlLink     urlLink     Hmmm... not much to talk about now...  ... I'm going to wrap this up now because I'm going to go ring Steph (yay!) to see if we can arrange to get together and do something... grrr, I can't believe the parents are trying to take me to Whitby on saturday, i mean, fair play on trying to be a proper household and engage my interests (I read *most* of the Whitby Witches series by Robin Jarvis so i kinda want to see the abbey and stuff...)  but why can't they make their plans fit around mine? :P... lol, I'm ever so retarded... i mean stubborn...  Have fun ye all! Martin J.  PS: "And she taught me everything I know and ever know about the power and mystery of love... and we got our upholstery torn!"
