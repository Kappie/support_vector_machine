We came in third place consolation, which of course is another way to say seventh place. Stupid smart people.  Midterms were okay. That's all I really have to say on the subject. I think that they will merely underscore the grades I've gotten so far this year, not raise any of them up (or lower them). I'm halfway through my Junior year already. Three more semesters of High School left. Wow.
