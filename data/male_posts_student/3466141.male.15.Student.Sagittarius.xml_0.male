You know, that funny little card game that has come with windows since the dawn of time, or the dawn of windows, those two always seem to blur for me. Anyway. I play it way to much. My second semester in a Canadian High school is boring, on an academic level at least, I get maybe one or two pieces of homework every other week, its ridiculous, in England, you get a piece of homework each class, everyother day, and there's like, six classes a day. Damn you relaxed Canadians, I love you all. So I have a lot of spare time, I waste it away by getting frustrated at solitaire, listening to music, talking to my friends and writing in the book. But always with the solitaire, it just keeps coming back, I don't even remember opening it, but I always find myself halfway through a game missing an Ace with no way to get to it, its stupid. And of course, if I'm asked to do anything out side of the pit of despair that is my room, I have to finish the game of solitaire I'm playing, and if I can't win that one, I have to keep playing till I do. I don't get much sleep.  Damn you Microsoft
