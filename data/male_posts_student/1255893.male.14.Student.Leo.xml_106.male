The 2 most noticable things are probably the auto cursor i have for this place and the games you can play (found at the very bottom of the page).  I would also like to ask that any of my readers plese leave comments. that way if you don't blog, I ( as well as others) can still have somethig to read. 1 more thing before i leave,  the countdown to my birthday is on! 4 days!
