If its a good idea, go ahead and do it, its much easier to apologize then it is to get permission  People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do  Put your 'hands together and pray there's intelligent life in space; coz' there's bugger all down here on Earth  Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups  Never argue with an idiot.  They drag you down to their level then beat you with experience  If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried  If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then  If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something  Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else  Make it idiot proof and someone will make a better idiot  I don't suffer from insanity.  I enjoy every minute of it  90% of all statistics are made up
