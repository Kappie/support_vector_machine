CLASSIC signs of either A) Maltreatments and/or B) Depression. So Mom and Jeff were visibly angry about the situation, and the way things look now, we are keeping Chelsie. They told us in the 13 years they had a Golden Retriever, they never bathed it once except near the end. Thats 13 years of grime and dirt! That must mean they don't feed enough or give ample water. So chances are we are keeping Chelsie. HORRAH!
