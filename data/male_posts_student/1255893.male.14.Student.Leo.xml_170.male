I wanna go out, not in a group ...... or a huge  group anyway. 4 people at most. Theres only one person I really wanna see right now. But seein as I gots to wait a week or 2 to see her,  Ill be gettin my @$$ outta this house w/ Johnny  Haress.  I WOULD go out w/ the people I mentioned in my last post, but I wanna have a chance to talk. . . . not to be rude or mean to you guys, but I talk a lil more deeply w/ Johnny and Haress, and I need that right now.    School's been ......umm ...... i derno what. Im not quite jaded, I jus thought of everything way too much, so it kinda got to me. Im disserpointed in CORE right now. Jus some of my classmates. Im stuck in the middle of a storm of Asian people in Irilian's class. I don't mind being ignored.... but I don't learn from my mistakes ... so I keep trying to engage in conversations, when after the 1st billion times it's been blatently obvious that Im not really being let in.   Oh man, I jus saw queer eye. This guy jus messed up the dinner he was makin for his gf, the dog peed on the floor befor eshe got there, and he forgot how to iron his shirt. He was trying soooooo hard. I felt so bad for him. Then when she got there she wouldnt really cut him a break. She complained a widdle bout the food. Then he tried to give her a massage and she was being all immatre about it. He tried so hard, and she wouldnt cut the boy a break. I woulda so slapped that biotch. She was so annoying. Damn, I wuv this show  :-p  Grr.... I gots nothin to say, I know I have stuff to thinkabout ..... but I can't put anything into words. Ill go read my new Marilyn Reynolds book now. L8.
