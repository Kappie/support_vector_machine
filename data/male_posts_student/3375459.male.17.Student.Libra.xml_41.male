Oh god, don’t think I can fall asleep that early tonight. I woke up once again for dinner, mum and dad bought this boneless duck rice from Kahlang Bahru which I really loved. You don’t have to go worrying about choking on any bone, because there isn’t any. When they say boneless, they mean it. Each grain of rise is just perfectly coated with a layer of gravy, every single bit of them. But the finishing touch to this dish is its chili sauces. Now I’ve got to tell you all I really hate chilies, but I’m ok with this one and I have no idea why. Maybe I should get the stall number from my mum later on and share it with you all, ok? By the way, they won’t charge you extra if you want to add more rice or chili.   After that, we (My sisters and I) watched “50First date” on the computer as our parents watched some progamme on the television. Second movie of Try thinking making the love of your live(Girlfriend of cause) falling in love with you each and everyday, now how sweet is that? I think it’s really sweet. So do remember if I do forget you one day, may it be time, aging or just simply I can’t recall. If you know me, do say hi to me and remind me of all the good things or bad things in my life. Hey, I’m talking here as if I’m really old next time. So don’t come reminding me every single thing after you read this entry, HEhehee…   Then I was stoning in front of the computer again until my friend showed up online, errmmm… in reality his Rachael’s cousin. Ivan’s his name, and he got through the 1st round of Singapore Idol’s judging. Sad to say his sweet cousin (not Rachael, another one from Australia named Vicky) didn’t make it. Arrhh.. Poor 16 year old kid, think she’s going to be ok. “It was unfair, There were like 200 people in the last group... they were send to different Judges and were not properly informed and treated seriously”, Ivan said. Well I don’t really know, what’s done cannot be changed. Good luck to you.   NOTE: Friends of Rachael, please don’t go asking her anything about her cousin ok? Because I think she knows nothing about this, and I think she can’t be bothered. Thankz
