My reaction to the article: What's wrong with this?  They're smart.  There's more to life than 80-hour work weeks.  I think.  I hope.  I sometimes wonder why the ideal that's held up for us to strive for involves lots of money, lots of power, lots of responsibility -- but not always lots of fulfillment.  It's not work-life balance I'm talking about.  It's finding a meaningful life, whatever combination that entails -- finding work that doesn't feel like work, so you're happy to do it; finding life that really makes days worth living.  I don't know what the magic combination is, what the answers are -- but at least let's ask the questions.  Is a six-figure salary always worth it?  Good article.  Read the article.
