I just wasn't thinking straight because it was my last day in a place I've been living in for the past 2 years. Anyway, for those who wants my take on my day yesterday, here it is...  Well my last day at school helped me discover a very Under the Radar player in class, Benjamin Siow. I honestly did not have him on my list of targets, and he just got 1+ marks less than me in average. Well what I can tell you is that he won't be able to go UTR anymore, of he's gonna get ready to get voted off. Essentially, I won't be the one getting him exposed, I'll let the Fairplays do the job; my dearest slaves Anjan and Jason will be all over this guy once they find him out!   I was also doing some bonding with the Fairplays, through a lame coin game. But it was really nice seeing another side of them, not having to be playing the game. I was in a really good mood until a "Jenna Awardee" came into the game. Well, his name is Samuel, and his mouth shoots off like a donkey's ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation. Not to mention his mouth smells like a donkey's ass. Some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light, and his brain to the speed of sound.
