When I woke up this morning to find out that I had yet another female stalker on MSN, if there are any girls reading this that are thinking about stalking me... please just save me some time and shoot yourself in the head. So after talking to her for a couple minutes I said that I'd be right back.... and then I deleted/blocked her.    After awhile I went around to the usual sites that I check, and I downloaded the new Yu-Gi-Oh episode (214) and the new RockMan EXE Access (42). Lately I've been watching a lot of japanese RAWs (pure japanese, no subtitles). The Yu-Gi-Oh was pretty great, the main bad guy got killed by a Blue Eyes White Dragon, o yeah, in the current episodes it all takes place way back in ancient egypt when all the monsters were real. Ummm... o yeah and the person that summoned the Blue Eyes White Dragon died too.    In RockMan EXE Access not a lot happened.... ummm... except ネト (pronounced Net-o) went out on a date with メイル (translated directly It would sound like may-ee-roo, but it is actually pronounced May-Roo) and then SwordMan came in and went..... "Grrrrrr". And ネト did something called a "Class Fusion" and fused together with RockMan. O yeah and all this is happening in the real world, not in a computer. lol and umm... RockMan basicly saved the day.... the end.    Today I finally tried burning Wes and Bret their DVDs of Hikaru No Go (awesome show, my favourite shounen). The whole thing ended up taking a couple hours. The first program I tried using was the one that came with the DVD burner... and that failed horribly. I made a nice little menu that had an intro and everything. When I went to burn the whole thing on to a DVD it said that there wasn't enough space on the DVD.... so I checked how much the file ended up being.... and it was 33 gigs.... which doesn't fit on to one DVD. So I ended up just making a data disc type thing, Wes can just copy and paste them off of the DVD... no fancy-ness for him.    Eventually I went over to BJ's house and we played Tales of Symphonia for awhile and then we headed on down to the pool. Wes wouldn't come into the steam room for some reason, maybe it scared him. And umm... we were at the pool for a couple hours..... then went home.    After I got home I ate me dinner and went upstairs to my room and talked with Cookie for a couple minutes.... we talked about the usual, that being of Care Bear related things. I downloaded a new episode of one of the many anime that I watch weekly.... and I guess that's about all I did today.
