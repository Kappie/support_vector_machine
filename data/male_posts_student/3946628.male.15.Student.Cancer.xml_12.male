Well not really, I ended up getting back up at 9:53 and I ate some jellybeams for breakfast... yea not too healthy but oh well, so then I got online at excactly 10:02 and talked to Tasha forever, and I skipped weight lifting just for my Tasha!!! So we talked for a long while and then I went to my grandparents house at 12:15 and ate some pizza from Pizza Hut. Then I went Walmart with my grandpa for a few things for them so I picked up a red dot sight for my pistol...I was so proud of myself..I finally parked without having to back up like 3 times...yea thats right after a whole month of driving I can now park! Woot bitches, woot! So I drove home and then found out that the damn mount rails on my pistol were too small for the sight. But that wasnt a problem, just about 10 minutes with my trusty dremel and it fits perfect now! I'll be takin it out back to sight it in and work with it a little more. So yea, I guess most of the afternoon I just sat online talkin to my baby girl, pretty fun, nothing else that I would rather do...so then at about 5 she went to babysit for madelyn, shes this little 3 year old girl that gets pretty annoying I guess, all I know is that her mom pays a butt load of money for Tasha to do it! Rarr...and I took off to weight lifting a little before 6. Weight lifting was fun, we warmed up playing racketball for a while then we lifted, I was surprised of myself becuase I got the whole work out done and i actually worked pretty hard and then did some extra work and did a bit of rope workas well...So when I got home I got on my computer, yea not a big surprise but then to my surprise, I was messing with the speeds of my pc and now I got them even higher (AMD 2600+ @ 2300mhz stable, equivelant to a decent p4 about 3.2ghz) and then, like normal when I was on my pc I went through a few geek sights because I figured Tasha was still babysitting and I would call her at 9:00, which I did and we had a pretty fun convo, but now its about 10:40 and Im gonna be gettin in bed soon.....
