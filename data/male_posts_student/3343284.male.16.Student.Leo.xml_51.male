( we [DBI0405] actually received notes for BM0030 and BM0031... we're suppose to collect the BM0032's note first thing on tml morning... ) and will be buying the IT modules notes by tml ( i will hafta get abt $15 ready... )and the book titled 'Essentials of Marketing' for the business module which cost around...    SGD $36 !!!   how @#^%$ expensive can tat be... $30 for the book and $6 for the online thingy...  so by tml... i would have spend at most $100 on things tat r needed for semester 1   ONLY...   wow... i think i need to cut back on my budget for this month...
