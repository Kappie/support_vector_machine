Emma S, you shall be missed alot too. Greenbelt was fun. My band is practicing for a gig soon. It will be tremendous. It may on the otherhand smell much like a collection of edam scrapings. My stomach is rumbling. I have had no Breakfast. Life is going swimmmingly...In Lava Rather Than water, no matter. We have found a house. I have already stated this. twice. I am not exited about leaving. It wouldn't be very good. All the people and more mentioned will be missed alot. Crabs. I have to go. My stomach really isnt too hot. Till another time when I have little to do.
