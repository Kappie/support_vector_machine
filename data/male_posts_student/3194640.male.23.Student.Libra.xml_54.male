I am counting down the weeks until this (the summer) semester ends (there's only three more weeks left). I'm looking forward to tomorrow because it's pay day  AND  I should be getting my student loan check in the mail (Too bad all the money coming in had already been spent). I'm excited about it anyway.  My wife and I are going with another couple to some musical (for free) called "Me  My Girl" which is being performed by Music Theatre of Wichita. I don't know anything about it. How cares? I'm not paying for it anyway. I just hope it's decent.  I've got some homework to do this weekend. I'm not looking forward to it, but it needs to be done.    Oh yeah, for those of you who are (not) interested about my phone, I'm not getting a new one until Monday or thereabout. Thankfully, they'll be able to transfer my phonebook from one phone to another.
