We had some hashbrowns and some pancakes and some sausage and some orange juice and some eggs (i didnt have any eggs, but everyone else did) and some fruit and then some carrot cake to finish it of (which i didnt have either (carrot+cake...don't do much for me)). Then we had an amazingly on schedule church service and then i got home and chilled for a bit, then had hamburgers for lunch and headed for the YMCA swimming pool with gramps and the rest of the kids (instead of lap swim it was Rec. swim so everyone got to go) and it was really fun. I had my new state of the art goggles and checked out the jacuzzi and then the pool and then the sauna and after a good hour or so we decided to go. This whole time my mom and dad were out somewhere at a party from 1 to 5, so we had the home pretty much to ourselves. After getting back from the Y we stopped by the Baskin Robins 31 flavors place and i had some ice cream and then we got home and watched Moulin Rouge, which was a very good movie, i liked the music a lot, thinking of  getting the soundtrack. Then we made our own pizzas, dough and everything, and i made mine somewhat better than last time (last time it tasted like a dried up breakstick with some weak cheese on it). This time it tasted like a pizza except it looked square, and could have used a bit more sauce...but it was good. Then we chilled for a bit and my neighbor down the street, who has asked to keep his/her name confidential, came up with the brilliant and somewhat random idea of doing S'mores over a homemade fire. Well, anything that involves fire and eating is all good for me...so we rush down to west portal to pick up the supplies (marshmallows, chocolate, graham crackers...you know). By the time we were there i started to get a bit worried since it was past my parents due time to get home (they were supposed to be back at 5 and it was something like 6:15) and they wanted to celebrate my dads birthday and fathers day right when they got back, and if robert nor i were there we would be toast...and i didnt have my cell phone...so we would be burned toast. anyway, we get back and there not there, so we decide to start the fire then just incase they get back soon. At first we have a pile of newspaper and sticks that are just making smoke and ash and a mess and it was really windy so nothing seemed to be working, but then we got smart and made the usual pyramid shape and things started to get toasty...we got out the goods and had a party. so...at about 9:15 (4.25 hours past their due time) my parents roll in and we go home and do some more celebrating and then get kicked into bed and now im here typing away while my friend is looking up on the web if its illegal to have a bonfire in your driveway (which is YOUR property so i dont see a problem with what you do on it). sooo...my eyes have been killing me forever so im gonne gat them checked tomorrow...and im hoping to see one more movie before i leave. I finally ordered the extra big SD memory card for my camera and hope it gets here before i go (i did the free shipping one which takes 5 to 9 days to ship and its June 20th and i gotta go June 28th...that means i need it by June 27th, which means it better noe take more than 7 days or i am screwed...). so, until next time
