So I went yesterday to check out my marks, and all through the way I kept saying to myself 'please let it be  atleast  500; please let it be  at least  500'. And to my surprise when I check the result, it is BLOODY 500 ONLY!!! Man all I needed was 10 more marks and I would have gotten a  B !! I'll have to settle with a C+. Awe Man!!! Just my luck!!  So anyways I was so devastated by the results that even when everyone told me that, I'm very lucky to get 500 especially in the new syllabus, that didn't cheer me up at all. And to top it all off, my mood was so down that when me and my brother were playing StarCraft(alliance), for the first time the bloody computer actually started to beat us!!  Oh well, I still found some time to work v2 or as I like to call it Phase II of my site. You know to up lift my spirits a bit. The sites turning out very nice. I've managed to add a skinning option, it doesn't do much though. I'll let you know when I finish it. Until then why don't you check out my current site it's  urlLink http://haiderali.cjb.net/ .
