What's been happening lately... i guess I'll go from the present backwards as I read things in my mind, that's how things usually go anyway.  I bought a drum! I've been looking for a floor tom or something to use for paint drumming, and I finally found one on ebay for cheep! I'll buy the other one some time in the future.  We did our youth service, but everybody hated it. Not the blue men though, everybody loved them.  My blue man party is just under 2 weeks away.  My computer has been "broken" the past week, but I finally fixed it- the problem was that the CPU fan was being a lazy bastard and forcing me to give it a jump start, much like spinning those old airplane propellors to get them going. It's running fine now, I'm just not looking forward to putting in my new one tomorrow. By far, my least favorite part of computer maintenance.  Also! I found out that I'm the only person in my school qualified to do a Lil Jon impression. I'm the only person who can yell a convincing "Whhhhhaaaat?!" and make people think that either Dave Chappelle or Lil jon are in the room.  The problem is that people don't get that gurgle in the back of their throat(or their voices just suck entirely, and they get neither the pitch or the tone or the volume right(you don't have to scream it at the top of your lungs)). I always explain this to people, and they say "shut up, no you don't" and I always reply with a hearty "Whhhhhaaaat?!" which shuts them up for at LEAST 5 seconds. Which is amazing, considering some of the gabby fuckers at my school.  Speaking of people I hate, I haven't made Welch's life miserable yet. She's our english teacher, and the spawn of Ms. Garling(our old english teacher from freshman year, who is in turn the spawn of all evil). Fucking gorilla, she didn't deserve to win Teacher of the year.  Another topic, BYRON NELSON! Mother fuckers!11 !!! THEY SHOUDL ALL BEEE KILLED WIFTH A KNIPFE!!! Or by a good meteor shower. You don't understand how pissed this makes me- there's this mother fucker that parks his car on our street, and the law doesn't allow us to bash it with a crowbar! MOTHER FUCKEER!!1111111111111q11 he should be shot.
