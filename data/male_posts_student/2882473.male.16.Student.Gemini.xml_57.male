It's just gone 1500 and I'm up to chapter 14 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix. I may just finish before  urlLink dickybod . I hope so... Although I haven't been reading all day. I went to Sainsburys this morning, and I've been on the computer for a while. I'll aim for about chapter 18 or so by the end of today, which will be nearly half way. If I can then finish the rest of it tomorrow, I may be in with a chance.   And that's really all I've been doing today.  Bye for now.   Weather:  Light overcast  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix  Listening to:  Burly Brawl  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Nowt  Annoyed with:  Dickybod, he reads too fast!  Mood:  Good
