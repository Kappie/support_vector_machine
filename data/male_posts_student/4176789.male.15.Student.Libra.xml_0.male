My brothers played one many years ago, and it took them forever to figure out that they first had to tell their character to wake up [or get out of bed, or whatever] It was something about a window washer or something, I don't really remember. Good times. Finally read a review for DOOM3. Woah. Truthfully, I can barely play DOOM  without getting scared out of my pants. Google zdaemon game launcher. It comes standard with DOOM1. 00 ~ I don't why,  but there's DOOM, DOOM1, AND DOOM2, everybody but me has DOOM2. poop. And it's pretty much the only way you'll ever be able to play against other people.  -I need a girlfriend...
