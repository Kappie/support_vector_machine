Lets see I wrote a poem in the library today (4th hour study hall) as well as reading the short little assignment for english.  Reid doodled a drawing for lizzy, and lets see not much else happened the whole day.  It's only day 3 for band and I'm day 8 now so I guess I have a while still fore my next lesson.  "Once Friends" You were once friends. Harsh words you now say. You are the same, but different blends. Not a word you say, not even "Hey." You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends.  Most can think for themselves. They need not two mothers. Find an old book and put it on the shelves. Along with all the others. You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends.  You play an evil game. That hurt the other's feelings. The other one you blame. A little love might raise the ceilings. You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends. -Thursday, January 29, 2004   "Behind the Grind" A blind mind will fine none of its kind lined behind the Grind -Thursday, January 29, 2004   "It's a shame" It's a shame That the plain Has no grain  It's a shame That the plain Has such pain  It's a shame That the plain Is in-sane  It's a shame That the plain Will not long remain  It's a shame That the plain Has had not any rain  It's a shame That the plain Has no grain -Friday, January 30, 2004 That one I wrote in the library 4th hour, like I said.  I got another idea for a poem, I'll probably write this one tonight (haven't gone not writing every day since i started writing again) about voices in the walls... yeah I'll explain it when I blog it.  I think i'm gonna go play a game.  Later
