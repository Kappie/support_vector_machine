Better then bobs.(sorry homes) so then people got really really really way to drunk. Now people begin to write on one another with permanent. It gets everywherem, including peoples teeth. Next thing you know a suitemate to remain unnamed gets a certain gravity bong from unnamed gentlemen. The suitemate then proceeds to spill said bong water all about our room. ah yes bong water.  it tastes like it smells..................................................................................................................................... .................................................................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................... DELICIOUS  ( those dots took me almost 2 minutes to type, which is interesting because i could have just held the button down) more drunkeness. a suitemate kicks a certain person out of our "smoking den".  (apparently our suite is a smoking den) sounds good to me.  then me (evil badger) and jeff (flipmode420) started with the mozart.  dont question just experiance it once and ull understand.  night ends with drunk suitemate and girls being thrown out by willy "the asian sensation".  All in all this nite proves that if u take 15 shots ull be a drunk moron,  and if your not drunk you have a lot to laugh about.
