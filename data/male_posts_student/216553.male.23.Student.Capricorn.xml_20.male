Yesterday night I went over to Nitin's house to have dinner which he cooked!  Nitin is quite the Chef!  I think he made "buryani" and some chicken.  It tasted awesome, and yes, it did remind me of home.  I'll have to learn how to cook something nice when I go back home.  My roommate is still in St. Kitts.  They didn't seem to come home last night - I guess they had toooo much fun at the music festival.  Hrm, now I have to figure out how I can call home...  Ok, be back later.
