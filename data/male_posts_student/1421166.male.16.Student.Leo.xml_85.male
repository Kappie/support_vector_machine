I guess it's been really silly of me to thing of my inferiority and stuff. From now on, I want to pick myself up and live life to the fullest. Was just thinking about the past year yesterday, and realised how silly somethings were. Maybe I've learned alot this year. Oh well, must learn to be like my favourite fictional character, Jamie Sullivan. To really delight in God.
