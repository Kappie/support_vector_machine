Last Tuesday I got my new mobile phone, a  urlLink Sony Ericsson T630 . It's really fun to use and I like the design, which looks somehow like an Apple iPod. Additionally I bought a USB Bluetooth adapter and got it working under Linux. Up- and downloading from my mobiles works, but hopefully the GNOME and KDE Bluetooth frameworks will be more stable and bugfree in the future.  Yesterday I started experimenting with Java ME and tried to do some simple programs for my mobile. It worked quite well and the API is nice. Made a program which can pause itself and performs some tasks in the background, while you can work with your phone as normal.   The next thing I'll try will be something like a Tamagotchi clone and I've already found some victims who will have to test it. There is no escape :)
