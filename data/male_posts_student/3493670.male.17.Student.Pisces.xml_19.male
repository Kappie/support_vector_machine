They would even ask me if I want to get married. One can only hope, I replied. Do I want to have kids? My mom would often ask. All I will say is, I don't know. Relatives would often bring up the subject of marriage and babies. They would sum up my life by saying,  sayang ka naman kung di ka magkakaanak!  I will just shake my head and smile politely.  Contrary to popular belief, I one had my dreams and ambitions. I wanted to be a lawyer, or a model or an actor. I wanted to be rich and have it all. But as I turned 17 I realized, its about time that silly ambitions such as these give way to reality.  Right now, what I want to do academically, is pass all my examinations in the homestudy program and have an 85% and up. I have two years to think of the course I'll be taking up in college. And in those two years, I have to pass all exams and I have to review for the UPCAT exams. I don't want to disappoint myself any further. Suffice to say, I am now DRIVEN. I am no longer ambitious. The term would be driven.  When it comes to the subject of vanity, what I want to do is improve my body. Go to the gym to shape up and have regular derma treatments to clarify my skin. Grow my hair long and have an extenso treatment from either Propaganda or Piandre salon. An extenso treatment is like hair rebonding, but safer. I wanna have more clothes. If I wouldn't be a model, I'd at least want to look like one and turn heads.  In my relationship, he is the one for me and I cant imagine life without him. We still have some barriers to break down but we will manage. I will settle down with him and him alone. Not everyone can understand why I am damn sure about this things cuz we've only been together for four months. My answer to them is, only I know when its right. When its right, you just know. And I don't just know, I am damn sure.  Career talk, I have yet to discover my future career. I guess that would depend on the course that I will be taking. Suffice to say, I don't have that in mind yet. I'm gonna have to make it to UP Diliman first before deciding.  Family Life. I love my family. We've been encountering problems recently but we've been patching things up. Details must remain undisclosed.
