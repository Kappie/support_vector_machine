Video games, TV, food, fun... man, this week is going to be so great!  I can't wait for it to start.  Also, that means no piano for me either!    That also means that i'm going to be missing playing DoD, major sux0rz to that, but i'll be having fun playing 'non-online games'.... they still make those?  Hmmmm, i'll be taking in some Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles multiplayer, and some 007 Nightfire multiplayer, and some SSBM multiplayer, and some Soul Calibur 2 multiplayer, and maybe some other multiplayer on the side.    Another great game i get to play would be  urlLink Far Cry .  That game looks really amazing, and the funny part is it came out of nowhere.  I hadn't even heard of the developer 'Crytek' before.  But it is also published by Ubisoft, and they made Splinter Cell, whis is one of the best games ever in my opinion.    Speaking of Splinter Cell, the new  urlLink Pandora Tomorrow  has just come out on PS2.  I am deffinately excited... the best looking part is the multiplayer!  Think, two different engines being used to create a unique sense of gameplay.  Thats pretty amazing!  I must get that.  I'll be having fun for these next few days.  Lates
