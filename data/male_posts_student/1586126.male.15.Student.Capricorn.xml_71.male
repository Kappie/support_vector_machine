I lasted--- wait... ive gotta change track... lets put fugazi. ok -- i lasted 15 minutes from school to here, and it was until i got here that i noticed that my dad had weird music on the radio. when i figured that out, it was too late o change it and I died instantly. How am i writing this? um... i can come back to life whenever i want. Damn, gay j's on the fone
