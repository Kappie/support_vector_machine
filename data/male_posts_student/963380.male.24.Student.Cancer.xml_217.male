Exiting my car I asked them if they needed help.  They did.  A quick trip and a jaunt down the 401 later we've got some gas into their car. I refused money, but they refused to get out of my car until I took ten bucks from them.  See, here's the thing. The ran out of gas ten yards from a sign readin "Next Service Station 46km".  That was the NEXT service station.  After the one 500 yards away.  I felt *so* bad for them.
