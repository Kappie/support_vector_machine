I'm trying to think of something eyecatching and interesting to say that would make some random person just curious enough to read a little more, is it working?  I hope so.  This makes me think of messages in a bottle.  Writing a little something and tossing it into the ocean of information.  "To who it may concern:..."  I'm wondering what will come of it, and halfway thinking of just forgetting it.  If you've read this far, you should definately e-mail me just for kicks, it'll make my day.
