But if you ask Valachan/(valanexia) I'm ebbiez =P  So.. mmm lets see, I found out about M 2.5 on a mIRC channel from acouple friends a long long time ago. @_@ Played off and on till it went pay to play and that was the end of that. So I got 3.0 when it was released and here I am playing off and on although with all client crashes and disconnections most of the time I'm on the login screen.  I myself have grown a little bored with Monster  Me as there isn't much to it and everywhere I go I seem to crash. ¬_¬  So lately I've been sitting in RemoteCave other wise known as the "TG/Training Grounds" for lazy people. ^-^
