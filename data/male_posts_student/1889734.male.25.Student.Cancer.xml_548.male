Bush / Dean ties Madrid bombing to Iraq   Dean once again utters irresponsible comments, blaming the deaths in Spain on Bush and America.  While he backtracked once he realized the airplay the comments were getting, it is further illustration of the man's fundamental 'unseriousness'.  Too bad so many on the Left believe exactly what Dean has said - that standing up for freedom leads to further death.  Appeasement is never the answer.
