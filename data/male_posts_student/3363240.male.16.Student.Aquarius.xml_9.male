After that I went to french, which was boring and in which I had a test. After that came lunch. At lunch we rehearsed "Inherit The Wind" a play about the scopes-monkey trial. After lunch came 5th period. Much much fun at 5th period. We did the play, and then watched another, laughed with friends much after making a jew/yiddish jargon list. After that I hula'd with leah....so much hilarity. And guess what *is insanely excited*??? KAYA CAME OVER TODAY!!! even though it was just for a little bit...it was still awesome!! I'm really happy to have her....like....suuuper happy. ~Elan comments??? even saying hello is a comment....
