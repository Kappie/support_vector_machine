Yeah this is going to happen as soon as Judy Garland' clone fly's out my butt.   Why is it that people always want to give you advice, even thought you never ever ask them for it? If I say it's hot out today, that's not an invitation for you to suggest a million different ways to get cooler! Leave me alone... I miss my studio apartment in Oceanside,CA. That was the best place ever. No one there to bother me, I could read all day or draw or play games without a care to whom I was or wasn't talking or paying attention to.   Lottery............don't fail me now!
