I had to be rushed out of the house this morning only to end up waiting on someone else to take my stupid picture for this site I'm doing for this rec letter I'm getting, and not a shabby one, if I may say so myself...  Anyway, I went to the Media Lab today and waited around for most of the day and called my grandmother (Mother's Mom). She's a really cool lady. She's old, but really over-worked. I hate my uncle (mom's brother) because he's a bigoted, cock-sucking coward who talks lies and shit behind my back because I'm smarter than him. What a cunt. Oh, and he also has like 8 kids and isn't stopping anytime soon because he has some kinda insecurity complex about being a good catholic. I hate the fake fuck more than the devil (and I hate the devil, trust me). He gives HIS OWN MOTHER a friggin' salary for taking care of his fucking army so that he and his wife can copulate (fuck) some more and make more and more kids and have their nice jobs to support it, as opposed to doing the reasonable thing and just stop fucking for a minute or two to take care of their own kids and just let his mom have a rest for the last bit of her life. Meanwhile, my 74 or 75 or something year-old arthritic grandmother has to take care of, raise, and home-school all of his little runts. I just hate his fucking guts and feel bad for her. MY GOD, and he's friggin' one of these conservative assholes who only watches fox news because god-forbid he ever see some real facts without a mucho grande rightward spin on it and then calls me unpatriotic for being liberal. Ya know what I'll tell him next time I see him? "Go fuck yourself, you old fat, first and half generation chinese fuck with an identity problem. I have more of a fucking right to be here than you, assfucking, orphan abondoning shitface (that's a whole other story). Second generation, you ignorant old fart, so dont for a second question my alliegence and patriotism and citizenship and whatnot to this counrty. I love it not for how it pampers me, but for what it stands for, unlike your stupid, republican ass*." And I'll say that right to his face, in front of all my cousins and aunts and uncles and his wife and my grandmother. I will have the entier family know how much I despise the existance of this man. Footnote Below**.  Anyway, getting back to my original story, after I called her, I got the pictures taken and sent them to my dad's brother (one of the ones I don't hate at all, and in fact think is really cool), but didn't get a response. Whatever, at least I did my part. I also saw some old friends and got a Mac OS 9.1.2 disc from one of them to fix one of my macs. Then after that, I hung around and then came home to fix up the old mac that I want to turn into a music server for the house. It didn't work though, so I guess I'll just have to take it back to Los Angeles with me or something. Actually, I don't know what I'll do with it. Then after that, I played guitar and yelled some random words that actually turned out to be pretty cool sounding songs. I forgot how they went though >_  I'm going to go work on the Long Awaited Post now, but no guarantees on quality. It's just   REALLY   long. I think I'll also write a post for Unpasteurized. It's been a while since I've done that so I guess I should... I'll leave a copy on this one too though.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Not all conservatives/republicans are stupid, but he is.  ** If anyone wants to know why exactly I hate him so much and why I think he should be killed in the fashion of the spanish inquesition, just leave a comment saying so and I will write a post about it, gladly. I need to vent a bit, ya know?
