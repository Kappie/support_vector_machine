MJ:Hi. *period of silence* Peter:This wall is pretty heavy *more silence* Peter:Just in case we do die... MJ:You DO love me! Peter:Actually, I..LUV apple fritters.  Mm mm apple fritters.  Thank you Steven Pociengel for that comedy genius.  He said that during a fairly serious moment in the movie last night, and I couldn't stop laughing for like 4 minutes straight.  Oh god, it was so much more funny if you were there...and Steve said it to you.  Steve is a funny kid.  The funniest kid I know.  I'm glad that I know him.  I'm glad that I know MOST of the people who read my blog.  Sum of you I could live without.  Yet...for the most part, I can deal with most of you.  I'm TOTALLY bored out of my mind for the moment....everyone is at Karl's DDR Party having fun...you bastards.  Leaving me out....j/k.  You can laugh now.....pleeze laugh now?  Pwetty Pweeze wif a chewwy on top? *sad puppy face*  Fine then, don't laugh...ya big jerks.  Spense
