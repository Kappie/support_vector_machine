Now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things:   1 Week of Summer School Down:  Friday marked the end of my first week of summer school (and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 Weeks). My first real speech is on Monday, so I have to finish preparing for it over the weekend. It has to be an informative speech with no visual aid, so I decided to do it over HDTVs. My second one will be on Wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid, and I think I'll do that one on either the Egyptian Pyramids or the Sphinx.   2 SAT II Tests:  Today I took my first two SAT II tests, Writing and Mat IIC. I could have done a third, but I didn't feel like doing Spanish and there was no way I was going to do Physics. I'll probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year.   3 for 3 on HP Movies:   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  definitely gets two thumbs up from me. It left out quite a bit that was in the book, but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book, the stuff they left out was fine. I don't know if I would say it was better than the second one (Chamber of Secrets), but there's no way it was worse.  That about covers my weekend so far. Nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches, but who knows what could pop up at the last moment.
