I'm tired, I have to get up tomorrow, and I'm feeling ill from the cookies I just ate. Just thought I'd get all the negativity out of the way so that I can be my usual cheery self for the rest of the post. Don't worry, it'll be short. It has no purpose yet. I guess I can write out something that I was saying earlier, just for the sake of being supercilious. I was talking with Josh the Philosopher and Krispin the Poet about a wide variety of subjects, and were discussing all these things that we  thought.  Finally, the conversation got around to thought itself. Our deepest, darkest thoughts don't really have words, do they? We don't naturally subvocalize, I don't think. It might seem like we do, but think about it: we were taught language, not the process of thinking. Language becomes the expression of our thoughts - our inner dialogue is really just another outlet of something deeper. To put it simply, if someone was raised without learning language, they would still think and feel and be human, wouldn't they? They would just express it differently. So what is thought? Good question. The answer? I don't know. Which is a comforting thought, I think. Which is exactly the point: I think. Yeah, that's it. It's a verb, not a noun. Difficult concept to grasp - maybe impossible. It's late, I'm tripping.
