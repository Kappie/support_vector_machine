I breezed through the first part, what with all the username and password and email address, then got stuck at what is arguably the most important part of the blog - the site name itself. I took some precious time out and, with the aid of the Encarta Dictionary, decided to choose "happenchance".  Happenchance?!?!?!  It doesn't sound the least bit familiar.  It actually means something that happens by chance - the Encarta dictionary defines it as a chance occurrence or event - and like this blog it did happen by chance.  So let's pray that my inspiration doesn't run out here.
