They've also got really cool water boilers, it's not really a kettle, more like a thermos water dispenser that keeps water hot and ready all day, and you push the pumping button to make it come out... Sounds pretty boring, but man it's awesome. Especially when you want some tea, and you want it RIGHT NOW. Hmmm.. this post is going nowhere, and i find it highly uninteresting, so I must put a stop to it.
