My Thanksgiving plans have changed a bit; there are plans I'm changing so that I can spend time with my family (mainly with Vy-mom). I'm sorry for not returning calls but I know everyone understands that I'm going through a tough time right now.  I have lost not 1 father but 2 in my life time.    This is my revised Thanksgiving itinerary:     November 25:  On plane the whole day. Arrive @ Sac airport 9:15pm   November 26:  Funeral home with Vy-mom, 5pm Kaci's birthday dinner. Date with April @ 10pm   November 27:  Thanksgiving with both families  November 28:  Lunch with Jack, Reya, Cassie, Anthony and his fiancee. Dinner with Cory and Ash.  November 29-December 2:  Funeral  memorial (for family only by request of my step-grandparents and Vy-mom. I wish some of you could be there with me because you knew and loved Kurt).  December 3:  Plane leaves 1am     A tidbit of fmily history, so you won't get confused:    1. My parents are Julianna and Tyler. They were divorced when I was 6 but remained friends.  1. My mom remarried when I was 13 but it ended in divorce a year later. 3. My dad, Tyler, married my step-mom, Vyvian (AKA Vy-mom). My dad died when I was 9. Vy-mom had become a large part of my life, she and my mom (Juliana) have been good friends since my dad's death.  4. Vy-mom got remarried when I was 11 to Kurt. He was a very important part of my life when he didn't have to be.
