Look at math. SEE, thats how you ace a final without studying!!!!! (please dont use that against me when i get a D) lol.  hm..ive had incredibly...umm..i dont know. bad thoughts. that i cant write here. or tell anyone. i shall write it in my other. horribly personal thoughts. and ive been cussing way too much. ach. *tries to worship aisha and learn the other way*  brightons on. but i think shes mad at me? ehh, i have like a 75% chance of being right. she seems especially cold when jennifer asked her where our final for spanish is tomorrow. ill figure that out tomorrow though.  ahh tijuana in two days. yay. i wish someone else could come too, but im still fine. ill enjoy it.   i cant think of much else. except that i wish school started at 10 and ended at 12 instead of 8 to 10. mhm. yes.   happy thoughts.  off to right sad ones in other blog.  much love  peace  ~alex
