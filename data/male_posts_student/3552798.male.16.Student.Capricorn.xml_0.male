I can't believe that we still havent run out of things to talk about! we talk forever and i love it. whenever i talk to him i feel so relaxed too. i feel like i can tell him anything and everything and dont have any doubts about it. thats the first time with anybody ive felt this way. even though there is stuff im sworn to secrecy i can't tell him about (if you tell me something you wanna be kept secret...i ALWAYS follow through on that) i wish i could tell. but i know that we will be together enough that he may beable to find out some of the stuff later. i love him soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly much! i dont think i can say it enough. i stayed on the phone with him for 45 minutes after he fell asleep and just quitely talked to him in his sleep. i feel so comfortable around him. i want to be with him forever. and i hope i can. but i guess ill shut up about him for at least 2 minutes :-). lets see here...today im picking up my parts to repair my car! then i can drive out to see my Joe! oops i was supposed to shut up lol. and my dad called me today, so im gonna be takin my car over there pretty soon, probably next week and fix it, then im going white water rafting. that should be fun. im gonna take Doug and my cousin Brandie along too probably. The summer has been going by pretty well after....you know lol...if you dont it starts with me meeting someone with the letter J. ;-) and also my friends have been comming over a lot. Last night i played 7 rounds of Jeoprady Junior Eddition on NES with Melissa. we're pretty good at it lol, and everything was before we were born!. i kicked ass though. i won every game :-). i love spending time with her. shes always fun. she also brough over a coloring book lol. good times. and i finally talked to Aaron last night too! he got back from his trip. i guess he didnt have any text messaging so i couldnt get ahold of him. sounds like he had fun though. and i almost freaked out too. he said his bf made him cry. i thought he hurt him, but lucky for him it wasnt way too big of a deal. i would do just about anything for that kid! but anyways i guess thats all i have to say. love you joe, aaron, and jake! and of course everyone else who reads this! peace
