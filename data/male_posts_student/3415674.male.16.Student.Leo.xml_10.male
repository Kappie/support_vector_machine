Somewhere I wanted to belong but time has passed and now it all seems wrong  Inside of me  it wasnt hard to see how much I gave is what I could not give now I'll have to fill the void before I can live  Never thought it'd come to this Never thought I'd see the red lines on my wrists But then again its all repeat I fell to the ground but now I'll speak the words you don't wanna hear in a tone that you cannot bear  Crying out I start to shout whats locked up inside but spilling out.
