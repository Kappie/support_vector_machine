I feel justice should be served to those who carried out the inhumane acts against Abu Ghraib prisoners. Whether they knew what they were doing or they were manipulated or ill-informed, justice should be served. Appropriate punishment should be administered and justice should be served. I understand this is only a few select soldiers and does not bear relevance to the rest of the Armed Services. I still support our troops and am in a debt of gratitude for their service. I also understand other countries and frustrated citizens within these foreign countries do not necessarily understand or support these sentiments. I just ask those thinking about this issue to think about how this looks to the rest of the world. God bless the Great American Liberators, right?   Although great fault rests on the shoulders of those who carried out these acts, even a greater amount of fault rests on the shoulders of those who presided over these tragic trespasses against humanity. As Nathan pointed out, some have called for Rumsfailed's resignation. I have to say I would not cry a single tear nor protest one bit if Rummy stepped down. Yes, Nathan, Don has experience. However, that does not justify his various failures and mishandling of the prison abuse and torture. I can think of an abundance of figureheads who had a great amount of experience yet were forced to resign due to various shady activities. Remember Nixon? I don't recall hearing about anyone protesting the resignation of Nixon due to his political experience. I also don't recall anyone protesting Clinton's impeachment due to his many years of experience as President- not even from liberals or Democrats. (They rightfully protested the impeachment due to a lack of strong justification. Censuring the President for putting his dick in the wrong place and trying to get away with it, sure. Impeachment? I don't think so.) Yes, the Commander-in-Thief, Rumsfailed, and the other cabinet members did not physically carry out these acts. They did, however, as Nathan said himself: "...[carry] out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently." Excellently is debatable. Well, now that I think of it, carrying out the policies set forth by the President is debatable as well. I don't think the New Yorker reported that Bush approved a decision last year which "[expanded] a classified operation for the aggressive interrogations to Iraqi prisoners..." (See Comcast Article Below) They reported the man responsible for that action was indeed Rumsfeld. Granted, the Pentagon denied the allegations within the New Yorker article, yet when haven't they denied true and false allegations? We all know how credible the administration's word is; honest as honest can be. I wouldn't say as credible as Hersh, the reporter who broke the story, however. The reporter has a lot of experience ;). (In a break from the sarcasm, Hersh truly does have established credibility.)  If you read the AP article accessible at: http://www.comcast.net/News/DOMESTIC/XML/1151_President__White_House__Advisers/7dc7fb7f-ca89-44d5-a85e-b951655e7851.html, you will see that "there were high-level discussions within the Bush administration last fall about information from the International Committee of the Red Cross alleging inmate abuse at the U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq." Nathan, I thought you said Bush wasn't informed of the abuse. Granted, as shown in the past, Bush isn't quite qualified to fully understand briefings. Can you at least agree that Rummy knew the full extent of the abuse as soon as last January? (http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/172703_thomas11.html) It's sickening to think that the administration in part or full knew about the abuse, tried to keep it a secret from the public, and once the public was informed about the abuse, claim to not have to apologize for the atrocities. Do you realize they didn't apologize until public opinion toward a lack of apology turned sour? Do you realize they base their policies on that mentality- don't apologize or concede until public opinion requires it. Do you realize Rummy didn't even talk to a single prisoner at Abu Ghraib when he visited it recently? Do you realize that this incident stems more from aggressive rhetoric and corrupt leadership than "apathy on our part"? That is why Rummy must resign and send the right message to the rest of the world: our country doesn't tolerate this kind of (mis)leadership. If you consider these things as fulfilling "his duties as the civilian leader of one of the worldâ€™s largest military" (sic) then so be it. Yet, as the civilian leader of the military, Rumsfailed bears some responsibility for these kinds of scandals. He certainly does not deserve a flattering label given to him by Cheney who proclaimed: "Don Rumsfeld is the best secretary of defense the United States has ever had." Even better than Cheney, who served under Daddy Bush as Secretary of Defense? (http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews=5081294)  I would continue with my dissatisfaction with Inhofe and the radical right-wing reaction, the lack of adherence to the Geneva Conventions, the interesting Red Cross statistic which states that up to 90 percent of those arrested and detained at Abu Ghraib were arrested by mistake, and more, but I don't want to write a novel. I will close by answering the fundamental question posed: What does this abuse mean? It means that our credibility has been tainted further and future relations with countries will take a long time to heal. We can all thank the Bush administration for that by sending them back home in November. Perhaps the village in Texas will even regain its idiot. This truly is Bush's Vietnam. If this abuse scandal hasn't proven that to you yet, then I direct you to any resource which discusses Vietnam's My Lai Massacre. If I didn't assure you before, I do still support our troops. I agree with Nathan that we need to thank them for their service. We need to thank them, support them, and bring them home.
