It hurts me to see people smoke, wasting their life and money, especially my friends(including my classmates). I was hoping for a class reunion with everyone present, not some gone due to lung cancer or other smoking-induced diseases. It's amazing how people manage to make money from causing other people pain and enjoy using it. Do they know how much pain my mother and her family went through when my maternal grandfather found out he had cancer? Although he had been smoking for decades, he stopped instantly. That was that, but in the end, he still lost the battle. I lost BOTH my grandfathers to smoking. I never even had the chance to meet them because both of them died before I was even born.  I hope that any of my friends who read this and are smokers do try to kick the habit. If you value your life and your friends, just quit it. You can't? I'll personally help you to! You will be helped by other non-smoking friends too, not just only me, trust me. All we want is for your own good. It's so sad to watch your friends smoking their lives away, and you can't do anything about it...  Toook this quiz, this is my result... quite true...
