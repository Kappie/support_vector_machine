Based on the true story of an allied unit taken captive by the Japanese during WWII, the film chronicles the prisoners' struggles as they are forced to build a railroad to aid the Empire's impending invasion of India.  Although the plot does not flow seamlessly, that didn't really affect the overall weight of the message. More impacting for the questions it raises than the manner in which they are raised, this film is incredibly searing and subtly powerful. What is justice in the face of barbaric brutality? What is the price of cruelty? Of forgiveness? The story addresses these questions poetically but not tritely. Wedding the realistic brutality of   urlLink Platoon   with the lyrical narration and philosophical overtones of   urlLink The Thin Red Line  ,  To End All Wars  trumps the former with its message and the latter with its plot. After watching the movie, I felt like my daily problems are insignificant; that in fact modern daily life is quite superficial. Listening to music in the car on the way home felt inappropriate vis-a-vis what I had just seen, kind of like listening to upbeat rock music after watching   urlLink The Passion of the Christ  .  To End All Wars  should probably be viewed a couple of times to absorb all the intricacies of its meaning, which is ultimately a message of extreme forgiveness in the face of cold-blooded inhumanity. 7/10
