I was sad, very sad when I walked in to the auditorium for the first time that evening.  Afterward I was very happy to be graduating.  I enjoyed my 4 years at EBVT and I would love to do it all over again if I had the chance.  I will be missing my teachers especially Providenti, my Commercial Art Instructor.  I will be missing my other teachers and friends as well.  I know most of them will succeed in the future and I wish them the best of luck.  - I will miss you EBVT
