I was in the shower and I hurt myself on the doorknob x( Nobody really needs to know the details, but there was no blood! That's really positive when it comes to dealing with a man's fruit and vegetables.     You can tell when I start off with a "My balls hurt" paragraph, you know its going to be shit xD     Anyways, Yoshi asked about my I'm A Dinosaurus Roar Roar title, and i'll answer now, with a link. I was browsing  urlLink Something Awful  a month or so ago, and they had a song competition type thing, and one of the songs involved a rapping dinosaur and its probably one of the only decent rap songs i've ever heard xD     But you will need to understand what a dinosaur is before being able to fully appreciate the beauty of the song. urlLink  Click here       Without further ado,  urlLink Click Here  for the amazing song "I'm A Dinosaurus" by some guy called Benjamin xD Right-Click on it and save target as... Otherwise you'll have to fockin stream it.     Need a download accelerator so you can resume downloads when you're on shit connections?  urlLink Click here!     Need a better browser?  urlLink Click here!      Using XP and you want to try and speed it up?  urlLink Click Here!  (Be warned, I cannot ensure any damage done, but I use it and my computer is alright)    Need to clear up some space quick?  urlLink Click Here!  (Its shareware, but you can use it once and remove tons of useless gunk using the Wizard function. First time I managed to get rid of 100 mb of shite that served no purpose on my com)    See?
