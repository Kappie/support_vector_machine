Now, I'm gonna spend less time showing you how bad Bush is and how good John Kerry is (even though it is fun to make fun of Bush, but don't worry, I still might do it along the way).  Here is John Kerry's Plan for the first 100 days in office:   1) A New National Education Trust Fund    We will propose a National Education Trust Fund to make sure that, for the first time ever, we fully fund our schools so they have the tools to assure our kids can succeed in the 21st century economy.  We will make a new deal on education – if Washington is going to mandate something for our schools, then the funding should be mandatory.      (2) A New Era of National Service    John Kerry will call on Americans of all ages – from students to America’s seniors - to serve in our classrooms, after school programs, nursing homes and nursery schools.  We will fight to allow students to earn four years of college tuition in exchange for two years of national service.     (3) End the ‘Era of Ashcroft’    John Ashcroft has launched an all-out assault on individual rights, allowing for a wholesale invasion of attorney-client conversations, e-mails and telephone calls. Immediately after the election, John Kerry will name a new Attorney General whose name is not John Ashcroft. We will also fight to protect women’s rights, civil rights and workers rights and enforce anti-trust laws.    (4) Repeal Bush Assault on the Environment and Make U.S. Energy Independent    We will rollback the George W. Bush assault on clean air and clean water and work to strengthen our nation’s environmental laws.  Kerry will also put forward a plan to make the U.S. energy independent of Middle East oil in ten years—and create 500,000 jobs by investing in energy renewable sources, such as ethanol, solar, and wind.      (5) Rejoin the Community of Nations    We will immediately declare the Bush policy of unilateralism over and work to rebuild our shattered alliances all across the globe. We will launch a successful war against terrorism and also restore trust here at home and abroad by making sure that America always tells the whole truth.     (7) Reward Companies that Create Jobs not Phony Corporate Profit    We will work to reward companies that create jobs by helping with health care costs, a new manufacturing jobs tax credit and new assistance for small businesses. We will also close every single loophole for companies that take jobs offshore and apply new criminal penalties, such as RICO penalties, on companies that defraud their customers and workers.    8) Create a Middle Class Economy and End the Privileged Class Economy    We will fight to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so that we can invest in education and health care.  We will also protect middle class tax cuts, such as the child credit and the elimination of the marriage penalty and propose additional tax credits to help middle class families make ends meet.    (9) Cut the Deficit in Half in Four Years    We will put forward a budget to restore fiscal sanity, eliminate corporate welfare, and cut the deficit in half in four years. However, we will keep our compact to seniors by securing Medicare and Social Security and protecting our children and veterans.     (10) End Influence Peddling and Secret Deals    We will reinstate the five-year ban on lobbying so that government officials - like Bush’s former campaign manager and FEMA director - cannot cash in by peddling influence.  We will also shine the light on the secret deals in Washington by requiring every meeting with a lobbyist or any special interest deal inserted into a bill by a lobbyist be made public.   That's it, and if you want to learn more just go to  urlLink JohnKerry.com , which is on the sidebar as well under "Other".  Expect much more updates on this in the future.  Also view my John Kerry Volunteer site thingy which is right above the John Kerry site.  Please watch Farenheit 9/11 when it comes out too if you want to see more "Bush-bashing", I think it came out at the perfect time, right near the elections.  Bush will probably lose alot of votes from this.
