Though the two papers that need to be written between now and then are a little less happy, but i will get through it like a pro. Hung out with a guy I knew in German class three or four years ago last night. I had a good time. Ended up watching Lost in translation, which i liked, and playing X box, which i also liked, surprisingly.  Started spinning some of the wool i got at Creative fibers last week. i washed some this weekend, and spun some up on sunday, navaho plied some of it this morning whilst watching(shamed look, and in a whispered voice) Dawson's Creek. I really like how it is turning out. It is a white Romney i think, and it has a great hand, very soft, and the navaho ply makes a nice even round yarn that catched the light marvelously. Perfect for some cable/gansey/aran type knitting. I have only a pound of it, but it still seems a daunting task to spin it all on a spindle. I need to get a wheel.
