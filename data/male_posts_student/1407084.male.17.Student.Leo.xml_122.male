Jumper  by  Third Eye Blind   I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  The angry boy A bit too insane,  Icing over a secret pain,  You know you don't belong,  You're the first to fight,  You're way too loud,  You're the flash of light,  On a burial shroud,  I know something's wrong,  Well everyone I know has got a reason,  To say Put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies,  That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  Well he's on the table,  And he's gone to code,  And I do not think anyone knows,  What they are doing here,  And your friends have left,  You've been dismissed,  I never thought it would come to this,  And I, I want you to know,  Everyone's got to face down the demons,  Maybe today,  We can put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in,  And if you do not want to see me again,  I would understand,  I would understand,  I would understand...  Can you put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend,  I would understand...    Yep. I'm gonna go watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail now. Have a good rest of the night, and, oh, before I forget..   Remember to drink your milk--it keeps your bones nice and strong.
