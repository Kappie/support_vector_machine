While at the mall, I went in to Holiday Hairstyles to get a haircut and saw my one friend from the skating rink getting her hair done.  She is being a bridesmaid for her one friend this afternoon.  Her hair was halfly-braided, halfly-twisted, with small butterfly clips everywhere and small curls in the back.  As soon as I step foot onto Paris concrete, I am going to buy fifty-four crepes...fifty-four because everyone else always picks a stupid number like "fifty" or "fifty-two".  Why did Coca Cola get rid of their "Surge" line of soda?!  I thought it was quite good...I know it's weird for me to be talking about it now since it happened many months ago (before Christmas), but I am just now realizing how much I miss it.  I like most all sodas except for Diet Pepsi (Pepsi One is ok though...).  I love the vanilla colas.  If you like both Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla, check this...v. coke contains artificial vanilla flavorings while pepsi v. contains pure vanilla extract.  Also, I mentioned in an earlier post that C2 contains phenylalanine that causes cancer in lab rats...Pepsi just introduced Pepsi Edge which has half the sugar and carbs (same thing as C2), but does not replace it with the fake sugar!  Amen to that, Pepsi!  They seem to be thinking more about what's "healthy in an already bad-for-your-body soda"...which is enough for me.  Even though Pepsi tends to go the natural way, I still buy Coca Cola more now just because the shape of the bottle is more appealing to me than the regular Pepsi bottle...lol...what a tart...
