Tyke decided that he is going to try and no longer think about how much he wants to be with Tina or even try and see if there is any chance for the two to become an item.  This is not saying that he does not still have feelings for her and that he is going to try and get over her.  It just means he is going to try and be just friends with her.  If Tina and Kram break up though...then it is a whole new story.  But right now at least, Tyke is looking for a new girl.  Ladies beware cuz this TY-ger is on the prowl!  Grrr
