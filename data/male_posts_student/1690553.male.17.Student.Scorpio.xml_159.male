Prof. Mohd Daud bin Bakar, Deputy Rector of Student Affair and Developement. Other VIPs present are the Dean, Deputy Deans and Senior Officers.  The ceremony kicked off with the arrival of the Honorable Guest and the VIPs. The Honorable Guest came in a MCIIUM black Toyota Unser escorted by a group of big bike riders. You don't read it wrongly, there really are big bike riders with rugged outfit with rock music in the background to match. Then the Honorable Guest accompanied by the Dean, Deputy Deans and the Manager of Taaruf Week, Brother Mohd Saifullah walked to the stage. Three Sisters flanked them on each side while dropping Jasmine flowers to the ground in a line.  As usual, the program starts with the recitation of Ummul Kitab. Then the recitation of glorious words of wisdom from the Quran recited by one of the first year student. He recited Surah Al-Mukminun from Verse 1 to 20. Next is the recitation of Asmaul Husna, the singing of the National Anthem and the Matric Song led by the Commitee Members Choir.    After the songs, came the speeches by the Manager of Taaruf Week, the Dean, and the Honorable Guest. The Honorable Guest quoted a Chinese proverb, "There can't be two dragons in one pond, nor ther can't be two tigers in one mountain." Then he adds, "So seek your niche skills so you can be a dragon on your own pond, and be a tiger in your mountain, and don't just be like small fries." Indeed, it's very true in today competitive job market.  After that is one of the main highlight of the event, which is the Bai'ah or Oath Taking ceremony. The Bai'ah Leader is Md. Khairul Anwar of the Laws programme. The ceremony ran smoothly and precisely like what we had rehearsed before. The loud voice of the Bai'ah Leader inspires a new spirit in us. Then the Bai'ah Leader came up to the stage and handover the Bai'ah scroll to the Honorable Guest.  Another unexpected gimmick came later. Two brothers in KRS uniform came from the back, supposedly been lost in the jungle. One of them carry the other one on his back until they are near the mini podium besides the main stage.   Then they pretend to collapse in front of the main stage before getting up again an walk towards the mini podium where there is faux stone bearing the logo of Taaruf Week which the lettering 'TW' and a green butterfly. One of them tried to pull put the sword embedded in the stome but failed which he finally gave up. Then they pretend to read an inscription at the stone which reads - "The sword can only be pulled out by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mohd Daud bin Bakar". Then the Honorable Guest is invited to the podium to finally pull the sword to mark the end of the Taaruf Week while at the other end a banner tied to balloons rose to the sky.  The VIPs returned to the main stage for a while before leaving the venue for some refreshment. We remain for a while at the field for some announcement. Then we are requested to take out the al-Mathurat from the Taaruf bag and put it in our pocket before us brothers simultaneously threw the bag as high as we could in the air and catch it back followed by the sisters. Then the final show is the particle wave motion done by all of us at the field, and that marks the very end of the Taaruf Week.  Thanks a lot to all commitee members, the Dean, Deputy Deans and Senior Officers for making this Taaruf Week a memorable event in our life.
