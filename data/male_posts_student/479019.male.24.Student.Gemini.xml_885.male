The sunshine is waking me up. I should rollerblade or run in the morning as it's been a while since I've done either. Humidity also makes sleeping in less comfy.  The past few posts have just been a manifestation of so many frustrations. The semester is about 3 weeks away from being over, and I just want to get away from here. I'm not happy with the work I've done this semester, I'm frustrated not knowing about funding (still!), the whole being sucked into the shit talking nature of this school makes me not happy with myself, the lack of   urlLink beer   in the apartment depresses me, not knowing when I'll be home is making me antsy,   urlLink US Airways   changing how they run flights to John Wayne Airport is really horrible, and there are worries about finding a summer job.  I was thinking of having a little potluck brunch in the near future at my place... food is something that is good...  Here is something that has to do with some issues of my papers... the idea of truth in media in regards to something like the reporting on things going on in   urlLink Iraq   parallels how I talk about the real and unreal aspects of media. Indeed media is generally skewed; however, that doesn't mean its all bullsh*t. Something to think about how there is such a thing as material reality. There are motivations that drive resitance to the American occupation of Iraq which are grounded in material realities... one of those realities is the reality that people are dying. Feelings are very real things to people, despite the socially constructed desires, and ideologies that frame those feelings. From there real people physically act within the world. Bringing this full circle of course is once again the representation of action in media. There is dialectic or feedback loop between the real and the unreal.  Humidity makes me want to shower like every 20 minutes...  **
