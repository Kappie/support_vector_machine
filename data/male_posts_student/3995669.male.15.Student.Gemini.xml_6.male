I've been working all week at the Lock Haven dry cleaners, and I will be this week as well. But that means I get CA$H to go shopping with when I go away for a week to my gram's near Harrisburg.  I am extremely upset regarding scheduling. I received my schedule in the mail on Saturday, accompanied with a letter:   Dear Geordan Grieco (10):      In this mailing, you will find your schedule for the 2004-05 school year. Every year, for a variety of reasons, certain course selections cannot be accommodated by the master schedule.      Unfortunately, we have not been able to include   Chemistry I Honors, Business Management, Marketing  ,  one   of your  original requests, in your schedule for the 2004-05 school year, because of a conflict with   Too many requests and alignment of courses selected.      We have replaced your original request(s) with   Computer Programming, Chemistry I .       If you are satisfied with the change(s), you do not need to do anything. However, if you prefer some other arrangement, guidance counselors will be available at the high school on WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 18, 2004, from 8:00am - 2:00pm to assist you with schedule revisions ... This will be the only day changes will be made, so please make arrangements to be here. PLEASE BRING YOUR SCHEDULE AND THIS LETTER WITH YOU.      In the meantime, please give careful consideration to those replacement courses you feel are best suited to your needs. Be reminded that the schedule adjustments must conform to the distribution requirements outlined on page 5 of the Student Handbook. It may be that you will want to reinstate the course(s) deleted while eliminating something else from your schedule. Again, scheduling limitations might well prevent our adding some of these courses. I apologize for this inconvenience .   (Signed) John P. Cokefair   Red House Principal      P.S. If you have a question or if you would like to work on your schedule with me prior to this date, please call me at 323-8411, ext. 3240. I will do my best to help you. Please remember that NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE AFTER AUGUST 18, 2004.   .......... You can just imagine how infuriated I was when I received this letter. How in the hell are they going to put me in an academic course because they don't have enough openings or something?? What kind of a fucking Mickey Mouse operation are they running?? And why in God's name would they put me in Computer Programming??? Also - August 18th is the time period I will be at my gram's house. So I am planning to call FIRST THING tomorrow (Monday) morning, because this is bull shit. I would also like to explain my choice of using  blue   to highlight above where it says "one". I actually have THREE courses that they aren't giving me. I am just so freaking upset. This crap happened last year ... I got my schedule, then I got to school and they gave me a new one, with the order of periods and everything moved around. It just infuriates me. I was absolutely freaking LIVID when I opened that mail. Why can't anything just be fucking easy??? I about laughed when I read the letter from Huddy about their "outstanding academic offerings" Yeah ... maybe if I'd be able to get at least 2/3 of the classes I was recommended to/asked for. I'll say it right now: if there is no way around changing Computer Programming (which I doubt) or Chemistry regular ... I will NOT be showing up for those classes. Also ... it is odd: on my schedule, they gave me Study Hall with Mr. Grove first period?? I used to have his Biology Honors first period. Is he not teaching that now? If not, I wonder why ...??!?!? Hmm ...   I will update you on the progression of these disturbing events in a later posting.  Random Thought: Why was I born white?  I love ... Jello instant pudding I hate ... public toilet seats  Comment ------------------------------------------------>
