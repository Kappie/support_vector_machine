However, I would enjoy watching it on video. Ha! Bwah Ha Ha Ha! Even  I  didn't believe that! I really don't have anything to say except that I'm blogging from the school library where there has been no appearance of the Killjoy. Thankfully. Hey! Look! It's an actual class coming in to do actual research in the actual library. You know we have about ten computer labs why don't teachers take advantage of those? By the way, links probably won't be up for a while, because I don't care that much.   History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.
