So anyway there's always something on the Dell of value for blog lyrics hehe. But the transition back to rock from exclusively hiphop continues. My best bud turns out to hold the matching pieces of the puzzle that I had only begun to explore while I can offer him the underground hiphop pieces. Isn't mutually beneficial synthesis grand?  I have no idea how I'm still running on such a small amount of sleep this weekend. A class, two routes, a party, a trip to Leb., a new networking/journal setup, a photoshoot, some music sharing, new pets, an excellent marinated tomato salad, a little beer-drinking, lots of iced-coffee's, girls, girls, girls, oh and cool guys too, can't forget not to be hating on them as much as I may have been known to in the past. But then again, they ain't exactly the same bros as before.  I guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys. Its too damn late to apologize. Its almost over now, almost over now.  So who to court first, and how to keep them all going until I can make up my mind is the task at hand. This work and school shit is getting pretty basic. And who to live with to keep as many balls in the air as possible without confusing anyone, including me. Mmm, I love my ladies...yes, I love my bros too...life is good. Ahh, how about a little old Offspring on the LaunchCAST?  Hey, man you talking back to me? take him out. gotta keep em separated. hey, man you disrespecting me? take him out. gotta keep em separated.  So am I going punk again? what these fake little bitches (girls like you are all a dime a dozen) don't realize is I was always more punk than their fake asses were all along. aggh, why do I even feel the need to defend myself against your petty voices and well-known-to-me opinions when I know that you're entirely full of shit? seems a common thing for people to do. Its a little like PTSD, or the parental tape bullshit. People just continue to defend themselves against perceived threats even after they're gone. I'm better than that though, and I always have been, whether I knew it or not. Those that have a hard time accepting me in their life are those that can't deal with someone who's not predictable. Even that I feel I have to defend somehow. Well guess what? Most of the predictions you ever made of me were wrong. And the ones that were right were self-fulfilling prophecies. I am whatever you say I am.   What's on [insert best friend's name here]'s Dell besides party pics of bis and I's?  Taking Back Sunday,  Cute Without The 'E'   (I stay jealous)  I stay wrecked and jealous for this,  for this simple reason  I just need to keep you in mind  as something larger than life  (she'll destroy us all before she's through  and find a way to blame somebody else)
