Argument:It is possible that some colors used within the content of a page may be offensive to select users.  Evidence:Colors are a source of ethnic identity and, when used, may alienate certain groups.  Argument:The alignment of a page may indicate whiteness.   Evidence: A majority of web pages are written in English and, therefore, align on the left hand side. Sites using other languages may align to the right depending upon how it is read.  Argument: Images used with the content of the page may indicate whiteness. Evidence: Many of images are of white students and faculty/staff  External Sources:  1. Used statistics from the the US Census Bureau.   2. Found an article written by Dr. Peggy McIntosh titled, "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack."  3. Used ideas from Robin Williams' book, "The Non-Designer's Design Book:  Design and Typographic Principles for the Visual Novice  Possible refutation for my argument:   1. Someone might say that my arguments are silly.  First of all, can someone really be offended by the colors used within a site?  Do colors indicate whiteness? 2. The alignment of text within your average page is the norm. Does this really indicate whiteness? 3. The images used are true representations of the actual faculty, staff and student body. Does this represent whiteness or the actual make up of these groups?   My Conclusion: If we truly want to live in a society where all people are considered equally, then we have to be understanding of the challenges that others face in their day-to-day lives and work to provide a field of play that is inclusive, rather than exclusive.
