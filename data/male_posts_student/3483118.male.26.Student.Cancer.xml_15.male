Edwards was my sentimental favorite from the primaries, and his ability to frame domestic issues in moral terms is important and refreshing.  I look forward to hearing him contrast his ticket with the Republicans'.  He'll be a smash at the convention.  His press hasn't been great thus far, and not just from the Washington Times.  Watch tv, listen to the radio or read a paper and you'll quickly learn that John Edwards is an inexperienced, smooth-talking, rich personal injury lawyer with a good stump speech and a stirring biography.  That's a short leap from an incompetent, slick, greedy ambulance chaser who'll sing you a hell of a tune.     Given that the Republicans didn't have the best luck against Clinton, you'd think they'd try to avoid reincarnating him.
