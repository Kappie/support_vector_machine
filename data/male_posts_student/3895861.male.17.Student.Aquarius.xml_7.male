But w/e. My intention, with this blog, is to record some of the fucked thoughts that make their way through my mind, as well as some of the occurances since the last blog (except this one, which is intro and last cuppla days). There is no telling how long that may be. Altho I guess it woun't be that long b/c my memory sux. What the hell am I doing up this early? I'm glad you asked. Before I fell asleep yesterday, I had not slept in 48 hours or so. 16 hours of that were spent at werk, including the last 8 tortuous hours spent trying not to collapse from a standing position. O well, I gots paid. I am going to an autocross event tmo...later today. It will be fun as long as my car doesn't fall apart. I never understood why it was chosen to put the division between days at midnight. It seems much more logical ot me to put that split at sunrise. That is how I think of it, and I often have to correct myself b/c of it. It has been said to me that if i slept at night, it wouldn't matter to me at all, to which i replied "STFU, voice-in-my-head" (Is voice-in-my-head hyphenated? [I suppose I get to pick; I pick YES!]). But really now, standards are not made for the everyday occurance, but for the exception that must also be measured, in the same way that trust is not for when you are watching somebody. Of course, then there is the whole measurement of the time of the day that we go through, but nvm, I will save that for a later blog, much later. like in the P.M. (I hate that.)  GOOD NOIGHT! MORNING, W/E!
