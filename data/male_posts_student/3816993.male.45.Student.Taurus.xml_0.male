One young man, quoted in the article, stated:   "I find that Italians accept you as an individual," said...Sabhe Ayoub, a young Palestinian refugee from Gaza, "They accept us more than we would if they migrated to our countries. The hostility after Sept. 11? Some of it is understandable. But some of it is a political game of people trying to win votes at our expense. We just want to get along."   It's interesting to read Ayoub's assertion that he and his peers find more tolerance and acceptance in the west while douting that similar young adults from the west would find the same where he came from.  Although President Bush was very clear that Moslems and individuals of Arab descent were not to be persecuted after the horrible events of September 11th, time after time I have heard and read of ongoing problems here in the U.S. Perhaps some of this is understandable given that those of us in the west have had little to no exposure to people raised and/or practicing their Islamic faith.  I've never been to Italy so I can not write from experience. However, based on conversations with my Italian-language tutor, who is a native of Italy, it seems that Italians are not quite used to having to deal with large numbers of immigrants as we have here in the States. And yet, here in this article, several young adult Moslems are quoted as stating that they find a level of tolerance and acceptance in Italy that prompts within them a desire to embrace some of its ways. I can't recall ever having read or heard the same from similar young adults who were born and raised here in the States. Is there a fundamental cultural difference between the U.S. and, for example, a culture such as Italy when it comes to an overall attitude of tolerance and acceptance (at least towards those who practice a different religious faith)?  In any event, it seems that where tolerance and acceptance abound the temptation to embrace a more extremist world view tends to diminish.
