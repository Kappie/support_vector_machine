Like two days ago when I was in Herzelya in that mall, my nephew wanted a Mc's meal so we were standing in line and some guy, which I have never seen comes to me, hits me on the shoulder and says "Hey, don't you think you are fat enough?" and then appolagised saying he thought I was someone else...YEAH like that is comforoting, you still said that I am fat :(, which I am not...I am just a little bit full.  Sure I am no super star, with muscles in his belly, or have a charming personallity, and surly my glasses can even top why people don't think I am prince charming. So SURE I am full, have glasses, don't have the self-confidence of a star but I am still a person, with feelings, you can't just come over to me and insult me...like it's not enough that I feel that way, you need to come over to me and tell me that infront of 40 people? Thats really low...really low...
