I think it is fricken' hilarious that you and Tay have the same "not my president" shirt.    The end of school coming really hasen't hit me yet also.  It is pretty cool that we will get the group square in chemisty.  I dont know why Holby is such a bigot against our idea.  Its all in fun man.  Why cant you be happy that this is happening?  JUST LAY THE FRICK OFF MANN!!  Also, we will have to burn all of our school stuff, but when? (Holby, lay off!! What is your problem here?)    You guys should give me your phone numbers so we can play tennis in the summer if you want.
