I don't remember      Is there anything or anyone leave me a deep impression 10 years ago?   I don't remember      Do i still remember who is the person sitting beside me in class?   I don't remember      Do i still remember how many times i cried 10 years ago?   I don't remember      Now i realise, memories do fade.      i just hope, 10 years later, no matter where I will be and who I am turning into.    I won't forget what i have now;   I won't forget I am typing now;   I won't forget the friends I have now;   I won't forget every moment;   I won't forget the reason why my tears shed;   I won't forget year 2004 I was in Singapore;   I won't forget every road I had walked before in this country;   I won't forget every pairs of footstep I had left on the ground on here;   I won't forget all those nights I shared with you under the stary sky;   I won't forget all those moments looking into your eyes;   I won't forget all the routes we walked, under the sun, in the wind, in the rain;   I won't forget Sunset by my window;   I won't forget every meetings with the SNGS PEXCO 2004;   I won't forget everything about Compassidence;   I won't forget all those laughter about the lamest jokes;   I won't forget the first EXCO of Prefectorial Board of Catholic High;   I won't forget all of you.      If one day, I do forget everything.   It will be the day, I will never wake up from my eternal sleep.      Maybe, you will forget me   Maybe, nobody treasure all these i treasure   Maybe, you had already forgotten   Maybe...   Maybe, there isn't a maybe at all.       "Nothing is as real as a dream. The world can change around you, but your dream will not. Responsibilities need not erase it. Duties need not obscure it. Because the dream is within you. NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY."      -Pathatai
