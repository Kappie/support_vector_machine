Shocking does not do justice to what happened.  Fortunatley, there is another game to be played.  And I'll stick by what I said when the Cubs were up 3-1, if they can't win 1 game out of 3 with Prior and Wood pitching, they don't deserve to go to the World Series.  So Woody, prove me wrong.  PS  The Yankees still suck and I would be really hard pressed to root for anyone, should God forbid, Florida meets the Yankees.  I also think I'm going to boycot televsion and sports in general until 7 PM tomorrow evening because seeing replays of tonight will be brutal.
