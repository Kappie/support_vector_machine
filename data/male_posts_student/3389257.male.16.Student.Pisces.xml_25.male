Nor is eating semi digested sherbert.   I had my leaving party yesterday. It was good bar the drunk munchkin rodio clowns. Assholes. I have written some form the heart lyrics. They are good. I think. Not sure. Review, nudge.   My party was good. I'd like to say thanks to everyone who came. You all touched me alot (mentally, not physical touching). It was really good to say some goodbyes properly.   I love everyone who came and I hope they love me too. I am tired. I have had little sleep. 2 hours infact. Good news justine: The lump has gone down. Long story which needs no depth there.
