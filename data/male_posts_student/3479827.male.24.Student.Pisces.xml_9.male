In the evening we had to catch a train for our next tour, so we couldn't stray too far from the hotel.  We decided to simply wander around shanghai and do some shopping for a while. We took the underground to the "people's square" which is a relatively small area bordered by roads and a large theatre. The square itself wasn't very interesting, but we spotted a sign for a hong kong shopping street underground. We took an escalator down into the narrow street. It was similar in style to the one in shen yang, but a lot smaller. Inside we found yuqi's most perfect bag in the world (it's pink and says "ice cream is my favourite") and a new shirt for me.  Other than that, we had a wander round a couple of shopping malls and had lunch in a japanese restaurant. I almost made the mistake of ordering chicken heart and stomach kebabs because the picture looked nice (and the caption simply said "assorted meat skewer"). In the end i had a lovely watermelon drink, some japanese tea, some minced chicken and some lovely dried potato balls.  After all the shopping, we were quite hot and tired, so we took the underground back to the hotel. We had dinner, showered and packed ready for our trip. We also met yuqi's sister's colleague, who was responsible for us getting the discount on the hotel room. He also very kindly offered to look after some of our luggage while we were travelling for the next few days.  So, now i'm on the 10 hour train ride to the yellow mountain (huang shan). We're climbing the mountain and staying overnight to watch the sun rise. It sounds hard work, but the scenery should be fantastic. I probably won't be able to update the diary for a couple of days (not much mobile phone reception at the top of a mountain), so look out for a big update soon. Over and out for now :)  interesting china fact #6 - shanghai is one of the more hi-tech cities. I've travelled in buses, taxi's and trains that have mini tv's showing adverts and other things, in the taxi they were built into the headrests. Some of the buses are electric too, running on electric cables above the road. At night, the city is illuminated by thousands of neon signs on the top of buildings, some of them even show live tv outside.
