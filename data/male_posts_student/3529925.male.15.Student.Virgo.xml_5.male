I won't be able to practice mariba all this summer and I just got some stuff that I really want to practice... oh well. Say la vie. Or however you spell it. Crazy French. I was up until 6 this morning from the lock in at Zap Zone, and my dad is being a bitch and attempting to make me sleep now... even though I slept in until 4 this afternoon. Oh well. The lock in was a lot of fun, and I hear there's another one coming up soon (woo... more messed up sleep schedule... but that's what summer's for, right?) Ok... I better post this before my dad turns off the modem.. later yo.
