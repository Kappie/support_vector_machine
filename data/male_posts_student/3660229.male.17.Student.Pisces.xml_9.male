Each door has a  name etched on it, but some only have question marks. Some of the doors open easily, with a simple turn of the door knob. Others remain locked.  When I take a pen and hold in my hands, or when I stare at an empty word doc., my mind goes to this hallway. I stand at the center surrounded by the doors. . . and then it happens.  All of the doors open, I dont mean they gently creak open, they fling open with so much vigor its as if they have been waiting all my life to open. My hand meets the paper and I start writing.  My mind races into each room, exploring it. And I keep writing, writing, writing. I write with so much intensity I break out in a cold sweat. I enter each room, exploring it, understanding it.   Some of the question marks are erased, their name replacing what I did not understand before. Love, Hope, Fear, Ambition, Science, Religion, Death; all of these doors are there.  And as soon as it began its over and Im left on my knees in the hall way. I look down at the paper, and sometimes I cant even recognize what I wrote.
