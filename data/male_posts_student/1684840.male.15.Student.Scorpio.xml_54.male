Can't wait till she comes home now :)  I'm going to see her at the hospital tomorrow after school.  Ryan seems to be taking advantage of mum's absence and playing up big time grrr!  I'm buying hosting for this tomorrow also so you won't have to keep going to that awkward url anymore :)  I'm planning to make a personal website too, that should be fun!  Might go town on Saturday for like the first time in ages.  I just hope the rest of the weeks ahead are going to go this quick because the sooner the time to leave comes, the better!  Which reminds me, less than three months till Christmas!!  I love the red, green and white lights and the magic that surrounds christmas.  It makes me feel back when i was little and Christmas was great, and it still is :D  Night everyone, before the night periods go too quickly for my liking and I wake up shaking :|
