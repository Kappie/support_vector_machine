It occurred to me, having the current facial hair (if it can be called that) that I might be protesting something.  This isn't some external source like protesting Vietnam or legalizing pot, but maybe I'm just protesting something against myself.  I've been on these kicks before, but this one's definitely hung around for much, much longer than the others.   So an internal struggle might be going on, so bear with me.  At least I hope that's what it is.
