The night life, the people, activities. I do have fun here, I know many of you think I don't because I never talk about it.   My favorite spot is Plan B ( urlLink http://www.planbny.com/home.php ). It's not as chill as Bouche Bar in East Village. Mixx Lounge ( urlLink http://mixxlounge.com/ ) is the spot Erin and I chill at when we need to catch up. We go to Groove Theory @ Mixx on Tuesdays for the hip hop.   In my experience, New York is the kind of place you should move to only if you have close friends near by. When I first started @ SUNYB it was hell. I didn't know anyone. I lived in the dorms and hated it. Ended up with a straight-edge roommate that went to bed by 9. When I moved into the frathouse I started having more fun. When I moved into my own place, off campus, as far away as I could get, I started to explore the area more. Sophomore year Bryce moved to NY from Elk Grove. We shared a place and  that  was the best time of my life.  I had met new people and was well known but when Bryce came my social life got even better. I had someone there to chill with who was one of my true friends. My new friends were great but I was missing my old ones, those people who'd been there for me and knew me better.   I have been in NY for the past 6 years. It's become comfortable. It wasn't at first. Now I have to uproot my life once more to New Haven and start over again.
