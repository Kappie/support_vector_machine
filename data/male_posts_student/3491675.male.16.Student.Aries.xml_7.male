Im trying to eat something,Macaroni to be exact we=family doesn't ccok anything special unless it's for a special occasion. So while we were all sithing down beginng to eat my grandfather(whose staying for a visit)was like to my cousin=obssesed with animals, turn on the T.V. SO next thing i know they're watching Animal Planet and my grandfather is like "turn up the volume". So i at the time had started eatng and didn't realize what they had put on t.v so i decide to look up and whola next thing i know im looking at a tigers drooping and Im like "W.T.F, im trying to eat here and you the t.v on to a guy whose collecting tiger dropings". while loving Family is like oh it's just animals, which in turns causes me to loose my appetite and im like damn i luv macaroni and  can't enjoy due to the fact that you're looking at aniaml drropings and the tiger digestion system.
