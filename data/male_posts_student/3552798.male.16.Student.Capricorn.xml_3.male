Heres the article: 4-year-old says he jumped 'like a superhero'  A 4-year-old would-be superhero escaped serious injury Saturday after he jumped from a second-story window at his family's north Spokane apartment building.  The boy, who was not identified by police, lives with his mother in the 600 block of north Oak. Police said the child jumped through an open, unscreened window and landed on grass below, narrowly missing a patch of concrete and a barbecue. Police Supervisonr Sgt. Marc Wheelwright said the fall could have killed the boy had he landed in the wrong spot. The boy told nurses he jumped through an open window "like a superhero," according to Spokane Police. Officers said his mother and her boyfriend were asleep at the time, around 2 p.m. The window had been propped open by a stick, according to a police report. Police said the sill was about 2 feet from the floor. After being taken to the hospital, the boy was given a CT scan which showed no head injuries. He spent Saturday night in the hospital for observation and was listed in satisfactory condition.  Way to go Chrystal! next time close your fuckin windows if your not going to be there! you scared the hell out of all of us, im so glad hes alright tho, VERY close call.
