When I see him in the ring, I still cringe. However, I believe that the JBL character has changed. Instead of insulting different ethnic groups, he just acts like a pompous ass. Two weeks ago, he was challenged by Undertaker for his title. I did chuckle a little when I saw how JBL reacted to the Deadman. "I'm sorry, I can't fight you at SummerSlam, I'm... Um... Going to face.... SHANNON MOORE, yeah Shannon Moore at SummerSlam!" At least he is trying his hardest to make himself a "Cowardly Champion".  I just picked up "The Big Lebowski" today. That is a great movie...    Song of the Moment:   The Beatles - Golden Slumbers
