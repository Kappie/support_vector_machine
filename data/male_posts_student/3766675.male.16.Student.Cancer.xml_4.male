Loser me :) Why are people so strange? Snuggles knows what I'm talking about :P lmao... I love havin' my Snuggles around. :) Last night I went out to eat with my mom, nephew, sister, her fiance and her fiance's dad. It was so weird. Just out of the blue at 7 o'clock at night, my sister called from her cell @ my house  asked my mom and I to meet them in town to eat. So we met them in town  went in to eat and everything. My sister and her fiance fight all the time. It's so annoying. They're both gonna be 20 soon and they act my age. I'm only gonna be 16...but I swear my sister's age and mine need to be switched. They argue for NO reason. Seriously. No reason at all. Everything's going fine then all of the sudden: boom, they start arguing. Why do people have to argue just because they're with someone? I don't mind going out with people...but I couldn't get that jealous about someone. If you're gonna be with someone you've got to have trust..or what have ya got? Exactly...not shit. Sometimes I feel like I've got this huge understanding in life...but just as I get that feeling it goes away. Someone proves me wrong. But it's cool. :) I'm fine..no complaints or whatever. So, tonight I'm hangin out w/ my favorite peeps...that'll be great as always. :) Friday nights are THE night. Oh, six days until my birthday! Woo! Big deal. lol...:D Birthday's are birthdays. After a while you get tired of them. I think I'm the one who makes a big deal out of it..and every year there's a disappointment. lol...This year's gonna be cool, though. It is. I know it is. If I want it to be cool, it's gonna be. Okay, anyway....I'm off to get ready so I can go with Carly. I'll write more later. ~SiLaS
