I was rapping on his skull pretty hard with my knuckles but the cat, even why his head rattled, didn't hesitate to continue drinking the milk. I don't know how he did it. Eventually I had to just pull the cup away from him. So then you may ask, did I then drink from that same cup, from that same milk? The answer is yes. I already admitted to beating my cat...
