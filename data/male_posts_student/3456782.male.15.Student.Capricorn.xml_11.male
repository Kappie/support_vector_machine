I might save some souls, possibly freak people out with voices in their heads. Throw a giant knife with a blade the size of the longest side of nebraska into the astrology council's main headquarters. I'd probably kill some evil fuckers too, but I would make it an easy death, ya know, something more painless than painful. All in all, while I think I'd be a nice god who would do a better job than the one we have in power now, I'd hate his job. It's kinda like the presidency of the United States; we could all do a better job than Ol' Dubya, but would any of us really want to spend 4 years in that shithole? I didn't think so.  ...  Well, maybe a masochist like me, but really, anyone else?  That is all.         -- Feanor
