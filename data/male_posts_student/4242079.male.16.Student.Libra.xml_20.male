Everything that I find mildly interesting or that I get a little bit excited about he finds a way to cut it down. Aren't parents supposed to be supportive of what their kids want to do? My guess is he's just upset because it's not a job as a shop hand or rig pig or whatever the hell he wants me to do. I'm not him.  urlLink  postCount('newjob');
