Don't forget to help support my site by clicking on the links at the top of the page, thanks. I won't be telling you why I need them now, but I will when the time is right. Today's assembly was damn sian... Rambling on and on about helping disabled people and blah blah blah. I have a better idea: kill off all of them. Makes sense right? It's because of these retarded idiots that the good people can't get any better. They're a burden to society and by the Ultilitarian Theory, we should wipe them all out and rid us of our unneccesary worries and such. Wahaha... Today's Philosophy presentation was like the most unique - 'cos they were the most confused! Not saying that ours isn't, but they just ran through the issues like the same and I don't think they put much thought into it, as they ended the presentation without aconclusion! Lol! Ah what the heck... Sounding like a nerd now... After that was Physical Science... Still the same old ramblings... Nothing new. After that was Chinese... Nothing good. After that was Oral Communications... Nothing. But the real highlight was the matches in our class. It wasn't surprising considering that Judo has already become part of our life in the class, with Lee Jiao Lian throwing every other guy who got in his way (including me!), but in the last one he was pitted against Luo Yiheng, our resident poser. And did they stir up a commotion or what! Ming Xuan kept tossing Luo Yiheng just like that and with all the cheering everywhere, I'm surprised no teacher or even other students were attracted to our class. Eventually, in the last match Ming Xuan practically threw Yiheng and pinned him to the ground. Ouch! Hah, but that was really something before Martina Ong came. At first we thought she was absent, until I ran out to look for her (as usual, I'm the scout). Anyway, there wasn't anything new, just the usual notetaking in the darkness of only one out of the four sets of fluorescents in our classroom. Until, of course, Shaun, Kiat Wee and Prahlad started talking. That really pissed off Martina Ong and he told them all to leave. Of course, being the idiots they were (I love being biased), they refused to until we pressured them to do so. Clearly, both the Utilitarian and Kant's Imperative Theories state that they must go out, so there can't be a single leg for them to stand on (no arguments!). After that... Er... Nothing of course. Unless you want me to describe how to walk home and then post on my blog - duh.
