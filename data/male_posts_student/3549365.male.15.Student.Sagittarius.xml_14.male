This is Wen Jie typing. =D  If I am an imposter, I'll kill myself -- uh I mean Wen Jie will kill me -- for impersonating me -- or I should say, for impersonating Wen Jie. So you can see from the above sentense, I am really Wen Jie. Yes. No kidding. Who else will type so weirdly?  I know I know. You all don't believe me because I'm typing weirdly now but that's because I'm making an effort to type proper English with capitalisation and all. So ya. This is Wen Jie. Wen Jie is the only way you should address me by. For I will not respond to any other name you call. That is because,  I am Wen Jie.
