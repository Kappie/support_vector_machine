I'll freely admit that when Blair was elected Prime Minister, I detested him as just another Euro-Clinton socialist.  He is a member of the Labour party, and favors an expansion of socialist style big government in the UK.  But Blair has done something that seems to run against the grain of his party and ideology.  He stood up when it was time to be counted, and despite the billowing rage of his own party, he came to our aid when we needed him.  He has quite probably sacrificed his political career on the Iraqi War, and he knows it.  He cast it all aside to do what was right, not what was popular.  How many of us have the strength to have done something like that in our own, smaller lives?  Blair is sticking to his guns, even as 41% of his own party want him to resign.  I can't imagine him surviving another election, and we will all be a little poorer when he does go down.  The example will be made - do what is popular, damn what is right.
