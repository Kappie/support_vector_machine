The last long day before the shortened Wednesday.  But that means that Tuesday is usually pretty damn long.  In weight training today Bland was actually working out and it was funny cuz he got really into it and was rolling up the sleeves of everyone and looking in the mirror and making weird faces.  It was freaky.  But other than that the class was normal.  Today in Gov everyone voted on Senior Class Hall of Fame.  There were a lot of categories.  Hopefully Tyke will win one.  He has received at least a few votes for multiple categories but that doesn't necessarily add up to a large margin.  Apparently one gov class thought that he and Purdy were a good match for Couple that Should have Been.  Well, yeahhhhhh.  Haha.  Tyke of course voted for himself and Tina for couple that should have been.  Not so much cuz he truly felt it at the moment but he did so because he said he would earlier this year when he tried to get others to do the same.  Some people renegged on that though so it was probably only Tyke who voted that way.  But whenever he couldn't think of a guy for a category, Tyke just put himself down.  For instance, exotic eyes.  He voted Haras for the female counterpart.  She should win that one.  And Tyke has at least 4 votes for dashingly dressed.  He does like to look his best.  Sorta.  In a "hey it's cool to look weird sometimes" kind of way.  What else??  Ummm...Big Poppa Booty for best buns (what a coincidence that his name has to do with his butt) simply because he has a huge ass.  Kinker for most athletic, who knows who will win that category though.  Kram better not.  But yeah, that was fun.  4th period today was quite nice.  They were working on "preparing a video" that they are gonna film this weekend when Tyke went up to ask if he could see his grade but the dumb bitch said she couldn't cuz she was working on the essay prompts for tomorrow.  Yeah, can't open two windows at once can ya?  Are you retarded?  Must be.  So then Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil left and went to JIB for lunch.  They left 25 minutes early so they had plennnnnty of time.  After they took their time eating Tyke suggested basketball at Tibbetts.  So there they went.  The hoops there are hella tight.  One of them is like 7 feet high which means Tyke can dunk extremely easily.  So he was doing fancy dunks and shit.  But it is extremely hard to make a really pretty dunk even on that hoop for Tyke.  He has gotten way more respect for MJ and Vince and Kobe and all the guys who can dunk well.  They have to do it on a 10' hoop too and they are only like 6 inches taller than Tyke.  But they do have much bigger hands than Tyke and big hands makes it wayyyy easier to dunk.  Tyke can't even come close to palming the ball.  He barely can do a women's one/may not actually be able to do that.  But Tyke's tight.  After school Tyke came home, changed, and went to South Cove for bball.  It was aight.  One of the guys was bitching and whining about not getting the ball so he's gay.  But nobody really likes him all that much anyway so who cares.  After he left they decided to try out the 4-square court.  Wow.  4-square is awesome.  Tyke is also very very good at it.  He was the King for the longest time total and consecutively.  Although some other players did get good at it.  Skippy is pretty dang good too.  And Maniak can be, but you can get in his head and get him rattled.  He's a fiery player.  A lot of heart.  You want him on your team.  Well, if there were teams that is.  But Tyke was the best.  DCups kinda sucked, Jew was pretty good, Ju wasn't very good, and yeah that's about it.  For dinner Tyke got to feast on Chinese food.  Mmmmmm that was good.  Very filling.  And then Tyke played ESPN which was fun.  So although this blog might not have been interesting because all he did was talk about his day without much mention of names, oh well.  That is how Tyke lives his life.  For himself.  Yeah...right.
