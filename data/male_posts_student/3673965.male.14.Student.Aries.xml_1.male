Nothing better than neverending leveling. I swear, leveling on RO is so much easier. Maybe I just die too much, :: Shrug ::. I'm going to start drawing a filler for a friends webcomic this night if I don't have to travel to San Antonio. Ah, that reminds me. I have to draw character plot sheets for Niou, one of the main characters of, " Namida Kanashimi ".   Ja, ato de~!
