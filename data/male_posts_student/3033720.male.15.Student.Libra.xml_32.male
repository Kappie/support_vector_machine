Chris Click pretty much summed it up for me when he said "Andrew can get two dates and you can't even get one, how does that make you feel?" Anyways, thats not all that was bad about it. I don't feel like getting into it now. However, there is one thing that is getting good I'm not gonna get into just yet. By the way Anna, what is going on with Adrian? Uhh....thats really weird....I dont even know her.  Time for Dustin's poetry corner. Today's topic-"how much you love me AND your native american roots." As always, that topic was chosen by Aleisa.  Ahh...I'll do this tommarrow. For now feast your eyes on this
