I was going to review the first two bands but instead I will just say - the first band sucked enough to make me laugh and the second band sounded like incubus.  Karate rocked my socks off. Mimi was feeling a little sick so we left before the end, I will have to see them again for sure. Oh, I just love listening to some good quality music with talent.  Seems that more and more bands come around sounding trashing and fast or catchy and they miss the main point of good music = TALENT!  So on my way home, I had a little trouble finding my way out of frisco, no big deal. I'm new at this. So we make it over the golden gate bridge and we are driving through the hills just north of the bridge when I have a fucking accident...  Four cars including mine are heading up over this hill around 65mph. two of them are about three cars ahead of me and one is behind me on my left side. As we come up the hill, I see two deer in the middle of the road: one buck and one doe. So i begin to stop, the car on the right spooks them to the left and the car on the left spooks them right back in my way. Well, the doe makes it out of the way, but I fucking slam right into the buck with the front left corner of my car. His head slams onto my hood leaving a nice antler dent. The rest of his body wraps around the front left fender and leaves a nice fucking dent in my door and worse on the fender. Also, my fucking headlight is cracked deep. I pulled off the road to take a look at the car, the deer were quickly out of sight and back up in the hills. FUCK! my door doesn't open all the way now, I am gonna try and do some body work.  My luck just keeps getting better.   current mood:  blah current music: get up kids
