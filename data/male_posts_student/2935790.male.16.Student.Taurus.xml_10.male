He only wore a yellow jacket and grey pants every day (yes, the dream was so long there were 'days').  Anyways, I kept going down the street every 'day' and breaking down Eddie Murphy's door, and then he would greet me and hand me a new Celine Dion (or someone like that) CD that he burned for me.  I did this a bunch of times until eventually, I became a black  woman .  Weird.  So I went down to Eddie's house as a woman, and this time my friend Andrew was with me.  I broke down the door as usual and Eddie got really mad, I think he didn't recognize me now that I was female. He pulled out an automatic something, like an Uzi, and started spraying bullets everywhere, and then Andrew disappeared.  I ran back up the street and went home and as soon as I stepped in the door I was me again, and Eddie Murphy was making out with the black chick that  I was  a couple minutes ago, and it wasn't me anymore.  I looked in the mirror and I was kind of shocked, that's when I woke up. I then had another dream with James celebrating a certain day, that day being today, but I'm hungry and I'm gonna go eat so I won't get into details.  G'day!
