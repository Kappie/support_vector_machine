No. =(  I didn't blog for a period of time. Nothing interesting happened, so I see no point in blogging. Lol. Well, I still gotta blog once in a while, in case some faggots keep asking me to blog. Zzz. Everyday is the same for me. Leave my house for sch in the morning at 6.30am, reach sch and stay until 5pm, reach home to have dinner at 7pm, revise a little of my work for 1-2 hours, play SG for 1-2 hours, and lastly, sleep. This is some boring shet man. I had been doing this for about 1 month. I'm breaking down...... =(  Hmmm, on 16th August 2004, I got to know this girl from my school called Maxilian (a.k.a. Maxi). I chatted with her online and got to know her better. Ever since sch started, I did notice her but was totally clueless on what the fuck I was doing in SRJC. That period of time was the time when I had no interest in looking at girls, not at all. Sad, yes. But now, I'm BACK TO NORMAL!!! Hehe... Maxi, as a whole, had left a deep impression in my heart. She's the first girl I saw with such fair skin and smooth complexion. I couldn't believe my eyes. >.  Hydriz : 60/108/42/43. Full time clouter. POCs, here I come!!! =) Maxed gold imps, gold owls and knells. In the progress of getting maxed gold moths.  SC and Darius : Let's go chill somewhere this weekend. I'm bored like fuck. =(  sczwdar. wiggers4lyfe.
