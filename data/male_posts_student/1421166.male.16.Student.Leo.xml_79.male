I mean its ok to share here, but I think I'm missing out on my teenage life this way. So maybe I should just let loose a little bit.  Well, I got back my results just yesterday. And it was undescribable. Firstly, it was undesirable. Next, it wasn't terrible. So I'm just like totally feeling nothing, cause I don't know what to feel. Maybe it's something great. At least I can just let go. *bubbles fly away*  Here are my results:  English-69%-B3, Chinese-67%-B3, Geography-57%-C5, History/Social Studies-61%-B4, Additional Mathematics-69%-B3, Elementary Mathematics-54%-C6, Chemistry-71%-A2, Physics-48%-D7.  Ok...here they go. *blows* *bubbles fly*
