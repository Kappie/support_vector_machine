I started to read "The Joy of Sects" yesterday, but it's so boring at points.  I guess I'm pretty boring, when I look at it, even though on the surface I had a lot of fun.... Just not enough.  Oh something weird.  My parents think I was friends with Liza W. in Preschool or something, even though I can't remember who she is at all.  I dunno, weird stuff.
