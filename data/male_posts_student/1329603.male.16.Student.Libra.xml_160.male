Anyway, as I absent-mindedly blog while listening to Rodriguez's greatest work, I'll say something about how things have gone since Tuesday.  Well, Grade 8 was good, kinda. Everything went well, some things (Mahler, aural, sight reading) went very well indeed, some went alright but went a bit wrong once or twice (both Serocki movements, scales). Some things, as usual with me, went absolutely abysmally (chromatics, arpeggios, diminished + dominant 7ths). But still, 100% sure I passed, 96% sure I got enough marks for a merit. On whether I got the distinction I so yearn for... not sure, my childs. But, thanks more than a lot for lots of support ye all gave me - for example, Scott arranged a "Hooré for Jon" session at 2:40 PM, Tom managed to remember to say "Come on Jon!" at 2:40 in his lesson, Sam said "GOOD LUCK ^^" which was incredibly nice to read... just, thankee lots of people *hugs everyone who he knows who was supportive*.  Beginning to get a lot of the tickets through for Les Mis. The days stand as follows, at the moment... Thursday - Libby, Tobin, Laura, Fi, Nikky, Zoe Friday - Roskilly family (- Anthony)+ Phil, Sarah and her Nan (possibly, if I remember to tell her the number) Saturday - Grant family, Scott, Stanners, Buzzy, Pete, Curtis, Mel If you asked me to get you a ticket, and you don't see your name there, then I have forgotten. Sowwy, just club me to death with a sparrow and I'll g... don't club me quite to death, just enough to make a point, then I'll get you a ticket.  Wanted to keep this a little quiet so as to surprise some people who come to the Pates Rock Concert, but I might as well publicise it seeing as though everyone seems to know - I'm singing for Shez's band in the PRC. Should be pretty cool, I get to do 'Living on A Prayer' and 'Song 2'. There are 4 others but those are my favs out of what we're doing, I reckon. Still, funfun. Shez, Jo, Nick and Segye all rule, so it's nice playing with 'em. By the way, I have met them and played with them, we had a rehearsal aprés l'école aujord'hui. So ha. Anyway, tho, yeah. Shez has long hair *_*. Oh, and I need to remember on Sunday not to keep calling Jo short. She's not THAT short, it's just something I say.  Anyway, onto other things. Les Mis, namely. On Wednesday, we went through the ball scene. It's an uncomfortable scene to do, especially for Naomi (Cosette). Why, I hear you ask? Well, I should hear you ask, anyway. Basically, it's a scene in which she has no singing or acting part, but cannot dance with a partner in the background. So... pretty much what she has to do is stand behind me ish and look uncomfortable. Which, I have to say, makes my part feel uncomfortable. I hasten to add that this isn't her fault, more it is mine for a lack of ability to be self-involved. Anyway, it's a good scene for Marius apart from that. He gets to thwack Monsieur Thenardier. Or Joe, to use his other name. We've got a photo shoot on Sunday, starting at 2:30 PM. Eep. I don't look good in ph... I don't look good.  Argh, GYWO have annoyed me for the second time on a quite un-musical matter. I haven't been to 3 rehearsals on the trot because of concerts. Granted, that's perhaps unacceptable, and I admit to that one. BUT, and this is the crowning peice of such-and-such, they arranged an extra rehearsal (I state again EXTRA, there was not supposed to be one) next week, and told me TODAY, when I had already secured my services with Shez for the PRC. So I told them I couldn't make it. I was replied to with a rather stormy email saying I have to "improve next term". Granted 3 weeks isn't good, but the 4th is THEIR FAULT, so they can go roger themselves with something.  Oh, I'm not going to Torquay tomorrow, either. However, this one, despite the very short notice, doesn't mind me, and I actually consider this one to be of good sense. My literal first playing of the music would be in the actual contest performance. Impractical. So I'm not going to Torquay, and I AM going to both CAYO rehearsals tomorrow. So, that should please them. Yay.  Thinking along the CAYO line, have been chatting to Jasmin on MSN a bit, she's been really nice (yay!) and is probably going to come over and talk to me tomorrow. This could possibly end the spell of me having either no-one at all to talk to, or having to talk to Daniel, the amazing annoying trombonist. If Sian's there tomorrow I might see if I can talk to her too, cause we get on usually really quite well,  so that'd be nice. Yeah... I seem to get on well with female clarinet players. Oh well.  We're actually almost at the end of the Spring term, and almost at the end of this term's hecticness. HOWEVER!!!, next term we get into GCSE revision, then actually into GCSEs, and then I've got YMM, Work Experience, 6th Form Induction Week, and the GYWO tour. Let me entertain you. AND on top of that I've still got to juggle having a one-way love life. Eek.  Quote of the day:  "We've got to hold on to what we've got 'Cause it don't make a difference If we make it or not. We've got each other, and that's a lot For love - we'll give it a shot..."  From Bon Jovi's   Living on a Prayer   Love, Jon Roskilly
