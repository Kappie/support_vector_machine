As always, the person left it unsigned, thus preventing me from knowing where my justification lies. Though I have my assumptions, I dare not make accusations, for that is never a productive attempt. Let me move on to why the commentary isfalse, and where it is not false, biased and ludacris.   The first attack made upon me is saying how 'I'm too hard on people', and that 'no one crosses the great Sir Bryan'. Let me first ask who lives with humility. Is it the person who has countless shoes and matching outfits, someone who addresses herself as 'Princess Jackie'. Does a person who live in humility say, 'Everyone at my church says I could totally get any guy I want'? I fail to see then how I am pompous and arrogant when I wear the same pair of shorts for a week, and am in a constant state of abusing myself verbally. Nay, I say to you that I am not arrogant.  Second, is the statement that, 'I took advantage of her because she was so young'. What advantage was taken might I ask? You then bring up the stunning and unavoidable argument, 'If you really liked me than, blah blah blah'. Tell me what it is that I forced her into doing? If I can recall correctly, it was her who said, 'Bryan, don't you ever just want to go out and have fun, forget your morals and ethics for a day?'. I would argue that I put forth an attempt to instill some morals into her. Did I now have her promise me she wouldn't drink so long as we went out? Did I not tell her how badly I cringed when she explained to me of her 'fun' summers in Mexico? Did I not convince her (partially) that homosexuality is not a choice? Amen I say to you, I would go so far as to say that I did more good for her than bad, and wise men would be at my side.   Third is the lies this unsigned individual spewed forth not three sentences later, claiming that Jackie told me, 'she just wanted to be friends'. She did not, nor does not have any idea what it is that she wants. I say this without insult for she has freely admited this to myself, her mother and others on multiple occasions. If she truely wanted to be friends, then why did it matter if I did not recipricate her love, or that I had feelings for Lindsay. What then, if she truely wanted to be friends, would seperate me from the countless others at her church, or at school (James for instance) who she flirts with? It makes little sense to me that I am considered to have been pressuring her when I responded after her 'I love you', phone call with, 'I'm just not feeling the same about you'.   Finally, let us consider the attacks made upon me at DYC. I, 'pretended not to notice her when she did her skit'. In truthfulness, had I pretended not to notice her during the skit, I would have looked directly into her eyes and seen nothing. But nay, I looked away, for I knew that seeing her would only swell the pain that was growing inside me at that time. Yes, I too felt pain through the debauchery that was our hollowed relationship. I too was distraught throughout the weekend. What person would follow someone around who treats them as though they are nothing and plays them as a yo-yo? Next on the list was my phone conversation w/ Nathan that Jackie was present for. I will freely admit that I said on the phone to Nathan, 'Bye nathan, now give me kisses'. Let me pose the question though, does that surprise any of my friends? I say no, for all are aware that though I will act gay and blatantly support gay rights, I am the straightest individual whom has ever walked on American soil. It is because I am aware of this and not afraid of homosexuality that I can do these things. Pardon me for not being ignorant and lifeless. Jackie more than likely simply used that as an excuse to end the relationship when she was already in cohorts w/ John. And finally I was attacked for arguing with the lady. It was 'embarassing how condescending I was'. I admit, I was more abrasive than I intended to be during that 'great debate' I had with the speaker. That however, was not my intention, after I left the room I told my PoP friends that my message was not to offend, but to inspire and enlighten. I told them that I felt the Holy Spirit flowing through me as the lady and I clashed swords. Not only did I humble myself afterwords to my friends, but after everyone had exited the room I returned to thank the speaker. I told her, 'Thank you very much for your talk ma'am. It was very powerful and I was touched by your story, I can only hope and pray that there was someone who is going through what you did and understood what they need do'. Is that the rebuttal of someone who is condescending? And if it was so embarassing to have listened to me, why did so many clap, why was I congratulated?    Please sign your name next time, this debate is not over...
