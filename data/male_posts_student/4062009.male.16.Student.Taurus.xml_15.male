I don't even know if my teachers are going to do anything with it or not. I guess as long no one brings it up in Lit or something, then we shall be fine.  Anyway, it was the first day of school for me as a Junior. And I must say right now that I am already looking forward to Friday. And with college and the SAT coming up, man. I am really going to hate this year. Besides school though, everything here is just fine. Mom isn't feeling to well, of course with her being pregnant. And my new forum  urlLink  Club Eight   still hasn't lifted off the ground yet. But other then that, everything is just peachy.  Well, I am going to go now. There really isn't much to say when school on. But you can however read about my school day if you are so interested. Just go to my other Blog,  urlLink  A Students Life  . Alright? Well, cya!
