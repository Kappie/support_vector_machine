Fuckin lost to weak ass teams though.  I played pretty good in all of them.  Today we had 2 games we won both.  I did good today too.  Can't wait till season now, ima bout to lift hella weights and bulk up and practice even more now so i can kill in season.   Right now im tired as hell but thats ok since we dont have any basketball stuff in august.  Im just going to rest for a few days and do nothing till my body feels good again.  Then i will get to practicing .  I also only got 1 1/2 weeks left of summerschool can't wait.  Now i can put my wow card to use.  I paid 40 somethin bucks and i havent even used it yet sooo if u going to GA tell me.   Its amazing how doing good in a few basketball games can make you feel so much better.   gotta take a shower now so ima stop writing.
