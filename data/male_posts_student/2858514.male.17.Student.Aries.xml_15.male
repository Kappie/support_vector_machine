The partition step is short but I just understand a little bit. I need to work hard to handle quicksort!  Python is a really good language for studying algorithms and data structures becauese it is simple and powerful.  Another target for me is to study conics in my A. Maths textbook. Although I have plenty of time, I don't know whether I can achieve my target before the end of the summer holiday!
