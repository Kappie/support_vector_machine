Then once you taste it, it works it's way into your stomach, and from there spreads throughout your mind and body like the quickest and deadliest disease.  It eats you up inside, makes you angry.  Burn.  Fire.  Rip.  Shread.  You realize you're over-reacting to a simple situation... but a simple situation that has piled up on other simple situations, upon other simple situations... until the total mass of all the situations becomes this overshadowing, life consuming rage!  You begin to vent... letting off the built up steam... then the feeling begins to dwindle.  Mend.  Tape.  Ice.  Cool.  the feeling backs off, reversing it's course backwards through your veins and arteries and back into your stomach where, if not handled properly, a tiny piece is left behind, like nitro glycerine... waiting to be woken up and set off by some wrong move, bad step, or... another simple situation.  You go on through your day, unaware of this remaining tiny speck of your bitterness as the fog lifts from your mind.  You cool down, and continue on with life.  Laundry and late nights.
