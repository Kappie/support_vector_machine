Den somemore stupid kevin *sec one* 2.4 run 10.41mins still complaining slow, feel like killing him ah. I took 11.42mins, run with that yiming and that stupid jenson. Cb lah! he run left run right jump here and there, irritating lil midgit, somemore halfway drop hes stick! Make me crash into him!   Anyway it was fun wathcing people crash onto the patch of grass after they finish. All seemed so drained outta their energy and so exhausted. The worse part is that the 5 stations they anyhow count!!!!!!!! The stupid Shuttle run i miss the 2nd block somemore! den cannot retake! Pull up i did around 30! they give me 20! Standing broad jump i did 210 they give me 200!!!!!!! So BIAS!!!!!!!! grr...anyway im still glad napha over liaoz...
