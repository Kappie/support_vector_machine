Sponsered by  urlLink Linspire, Inc  and  urlLink Mark Shuttleworth , the program will give $500 to users who report a significant bug in Mozilla software. Users who identify security bugs in Mozilla software are encouraged to go to the  urlLink Security Projects Page  for more information."  urlLink       At long last! Been using  urlLink Firefox  myself for quite some time, and I wouldn't use it any other way, but I still do have to use IE for a few small tasks...for the most part, though, Firefox is more secure than IE, and faster...plus, who doesn't love tabbed windows and extensions? I update this blog through my BlogThis Firefox extension. Although, does anyone else using Firefox typically see it eating up 40+ MB of RAM? Hmmm.....
