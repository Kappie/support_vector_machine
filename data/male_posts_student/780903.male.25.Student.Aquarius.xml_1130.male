I don't mean can't-get-out-of-bed-sounds-like-you-need-to-see-a-head-doctor can't do much of anything, but just an eat breakfast, surf the Internet and set my fantasy team lineups, shower, send some e-mail, go out to lunch, go to the supermarket, fiddle around with a DVD, write the first verse of a song I'll probably never finish, fold some laundry, watch a few innings of the Mets game, read a half a magazine, make a list of what I'm doing this week, make some plans for tomorrow, fiddle around with an uninspired weblog post, and, oops, it's nighttime kind of day.  A where-did-the-day-go kind of day.  A boy-I-didn't-get-anything-useful-done kind of day.  And maybe doing nothing is useful.  But I somehow feel like this world filled with opportunities only gets scarier if I go to sleep no closer to any of those opportunities than I was when I woke up.  And I don't even know what I really mean by opportunities.  Like I said, some days the world seems filled with opportunities.  Of all sorts.  But then sometimes I'm just, I don't know, uninspired to go find them.  Just for a day.  I guess we all have these days.  I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point.  I just felt like I ought to write something and post it.  And now, even though I have an idea for a post that I'm going to write, I hate deleting stuff, so here you go.  Rambling without nouns.  Oh boy.
