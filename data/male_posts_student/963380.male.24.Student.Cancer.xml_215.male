There is a great deal of sympathy for him right now, because he may actually be promoting his way out of his marriage. He's got some sort of issue focusing - everything he's doing right now is leading him in a downward spiral. It wouldn't be remiss to say that he probably requires counselling and perhaps an elephantine does of some sort of drug ending in "-ac" or "-ax". When will he return? That's akin to asking "will it snow in Turkey tomorrow?" - damned if I know.  Secondly, in the past I have referred to The Glennis as an "Asshat". I was asked "if one were in the market for an Asshat, would one be searching for an Anal Haberdasher?" (A haberdasher, for those unawares, is a purveyor of fine hats and headgear). A wise, informed and self-indulgently intelligent question to ask. The answer, of course, is yes. Where do you find one of those? Ask your local Glennis.
