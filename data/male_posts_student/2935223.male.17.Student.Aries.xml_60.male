Ok, I have a question for all you people...you know, people who read my blog. Have I honestly changed anyone's oppinion on Tina by saying things on here....because she seems to think that I am making people hate her and such, and it's gettin' uber irritating...  BUTTON MEN ROCK!!!  I wish I still played Button Men with Cobian in the Percussion room every morning...that was fun.  I asked Keli Out!!  I'm happy  I don't know what else to say...... Wait, YES I do! Peace!  Spense
