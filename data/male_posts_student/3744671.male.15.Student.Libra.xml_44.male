This is a very handy program, I know I've downloaded songs, the legal way of course ;) where it had a long pause at the beginning and/or end of teh song. I never want to wait that long to here my song, plus time on space CD or MP3 player is priceless! Now I can just trim it down nice and snug and now waste any time on my MP3 player! It can also adjust the volume of your tracks, or cause them to fade in or out accordingly. Pretty neat for a small download.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
