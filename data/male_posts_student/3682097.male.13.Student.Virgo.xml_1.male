I managed to run the grill and keep the guest entertained at the same time. My mother and sister and cousins all lent a useless halping ow and then. in the end it was me and my brother. my mother who decided to have trhe barbecue and invite alllll her friends and children. i was in charge of alll these people. nobody had any complaints about how i did it either. it was my first barbecue too. i am so proud of that accomplishment
