And then they try to intimidate me by aiming straight for my window, then veering off onto the roof. It's my house, dammit! I'm not leaving and I have a twenty-two! See, now it's dark so the alternate species moves in as reinforcements. Flies are covering my window. They want me to panic and run outside so the pigeons can frickin gouge out my eyes! I really need to urinate. Mountain Dew wreaks havoc on your system. If carbonated beverages were liquor, I'd have liver disease. Is it bad if I just saw some pink sandals of my little sister's and was tempted to put them on? Is it worse to feel temptations like those in the first place, or to deny them? It doesn't really matter ... they wouldn't fit, anyway. Crazy image for you: a guitar without strings. Trippy. It's like some kind of sick symbolism, but I can't really figure out what it means. I'm not really that tired, this is just the terrible truth of my thought processes. I'm going to let it flow for a while longer. Nope, it stopped. Because now I'm actually communicating with other humans. Oh well, it was fun and disturbing while it lasted.
