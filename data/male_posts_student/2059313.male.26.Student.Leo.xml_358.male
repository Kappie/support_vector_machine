She has a two cats and I normally play with and pet them.  I used to be severely allergic to cats, just being around them would make my eyes water and begin to swell, and my nose would run like a faucet.  As I grew up, I grew out of it to an extent... I could pet them, just as long as I didn't rub my eyes with my hands afterwards, and I had no problem being around them... but sometimes I get absent minded and do something stupid.  SO while I was writing an e-mail, my eyes began to water and itch a little bit.  I figured it was probably my allergies and just suffered through it.  When I got home I looked in the mirror and realized that it may be more than allergies when my entire right eye was blood red.  Taking my contact out was a bit scary as the fear of a detached retina came screaming through my head.  I went to sleep that night and woke up with my eye glued shut from eye-boogers (or eye crispies).  My eye watered a bit when I woke up and they disolved enough for me to open my eye and clear off the rest from my lashes.  I went to the eye doctor (after donning my old glasses) to see what was up.   (to be continued)
