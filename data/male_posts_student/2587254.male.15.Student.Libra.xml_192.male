On a sidenote, Maisie today comes back from her camp thingy, which means....another blogger will return!....er.....Xanga....er. I wonder if she brought me back a rifle like she promised...    My day started off at 1130am this morning with me starting off my day drumming. After that, had some lunch and then called Colin. I walked to his place to catch the bus around 130ish then, and we managed to catch the 145 one. So then off we went to downtown to meet up with Jason and his friend, and John.    When we got there though, only saw Jason and his friend Darryl. John was nowhere in sight. So phoned him, apparently he wasn't awake, so he came down in a bit. Went to BK, got some food, then went back to H2H to start gaming.....    Fun times today. Even though I missed out on the first game of Wc3 *the comp b0rked,* I would come back and play it with them =P. After that game, and me playing SC4 by myself, we then went on to play Call of Duty, with me and Colin against them 3 and some other dude. Me and Colin owned them, they had no chance....and even though we were playing in a sniper level, after a while, it turned into a bloody battle royal-melee game, filled with machine gun blares and hand grenades. No skill required whatsoever =P.    After our dedicated server got cut off because some clumsy shmuck logged onto that comp, we then switched back to WC3. Er, TFT. Whatever you want to call it. The game turned out to be me, John, and Jason vs. Colin, Darryl and that same random dude. We owned them =P. In 30 minutes, the three J's leveled the map of its enemies....flat.    Then after some Quake, we left.    Got home, went to UCC, and here I am now. Argh I suck so much at breaking now...worse than before. At least I can sloppily consistently link 2 mills now hahaha, and I can almost rollback onto forearm, to handstand, and then begin hopping. So there is SOME improvement =P.    Anyways I'm gone for now.    Bye.
