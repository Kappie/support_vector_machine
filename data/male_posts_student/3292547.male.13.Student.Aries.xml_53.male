It did not show it had sent the post through, and thus was created about 7 times. That has been resolved.   (Note: Because of this, the link has extra #s at the end of it, telling which post of a while back. Sorry about this. Accessing http://abc-123.blogspot.com/2004/06/while-back.html won't get you anywhere. You should type direct links like that anyway.
