Cause it was either I'm way stressed out or I just watched Message in a Bottle - it does that to people. Haha!  I think it's not that I'm low or I'm wallowing in self-pity, it's just that I've sorta come to a realisation of certain things, and I might just have to get used to things.  We can't change our circumstance, but we can change how we treat the circumstances. And thanks to God, I can react to these circumstances in the way He thinks its best.  Fantasia's a good singer! Haha. I bought her single today. Wow. Heh.   It had nothing to do with buying Fantasia's CD, but I need to go for vocal training real soon!  Sherman
