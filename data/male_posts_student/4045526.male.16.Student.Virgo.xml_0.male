Today was an awesome day! well, not really, lol. some cool things really did happen though. omg, at work today (at our local grocery store) and old lady cussed out a van. it was halarious man! i put her groceries in the back and then she hit her back on the van and just let loose, heres what i remember.  ME: ok, there ya go. have a nice day.      OLD LADY: thank you.  oof  ow! stupid mother fuckin van! son of a bitch! bastard! shithead! asshole who parked to close, ima kill you! bitch! FUCK!  omg it was soo funny. and she was the really small old lady with a big bald spot and grey hair. that was the highlight of my day. well, back to the rest of the day. right when i got home i was pleasantly suprised to find that my dad had bought a new cd player for the car im gonna get in a month. (who knows if it'll still be there when i get it) i also got 3 of the new cd's i ordered a few days ago. (ill nino, thousand foot krutch, and earshot) i was told not to expect em until aug 3-14 so that was a major plus. i also restarted playin FFXI today after a 5 month hiatus. i forgot how awesome a game it is! uh yea, i gotta go do some other shit so thats all i'm postin today. talk to myslef later, Jake
