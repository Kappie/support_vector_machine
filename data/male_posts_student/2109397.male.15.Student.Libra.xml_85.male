I dont see how that is...but on the inside it is FAR FAR FAR from normal things going on in here. I needa escape someone take me on vacation or something. You stupid bastards who get to go on vacation. I wish my father and sister werent going to Chicago. I wish I could give the tickets to 2 of my friends so we could be on our own. That would be cool. 4 15ish year-olds alone in Chicago. Lol that would kick ass actually. Too bad my dad is an arse and my sister wont give her ticket up for no one or nothing.
