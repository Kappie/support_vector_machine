We learnt a lot about making queries and stuff.  Mrs. Checketts was about 20 minutes late but the lesson was worthwhile.  Physics was okay, we learnt about Electrolysis which we have done many times in Chemistry.  We had another mindmap mad lesson of French followed by an average lesson Chemistry.  Lots of people made fun of Mrs. Bonds pronunciation of "Both".  Double food was horrendous.  Mrs. Humphreys was being mega shady with Ross because he was drinking water in the vast temperatures of the day.  We sat there for 100 minutes doing rock hard coursework    We had a sneak preview of our reports, mine was great.  Everyone made a comment on how quiet I was, as if determinedc to find something perculiar to pick about me.  We get them back today because they were just giving us like a taster of them lol.  Food's report was terrible though... Grr
