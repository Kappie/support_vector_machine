Our original plan was to be out at 10, we made it out about mid-day. Still, at least we had a good sleep :)  Our first stop was to China's second largest market. After 10 mins in a taxi we arrived outside a quite normal looking four storey building with what seemed like 1,000 bikes parked outside. When we went inside, it quickly became apparent that this building was not normal. To describe the market as huge and colossal would not be doing it justice! The market stalls were spread over all the floors of the building, and then extended over a massive area outside the back of the building. It was rather hot so we did most of our wandering outside. It comprised several narrow streets lined with stalls selling pretty much everything. Food, bags, toys, electrical items - literally everything. It was quite obvious, even to my untrained (and un-fashionable) eye that seemingly designer good on display (like Gucci bags) were fake. But it seemed a resonable way to by some cheap food and clothes.  The market closed at one, so we made our way back to the city centre to do some more shopping. A quick stop for ice-cream and a drink refreshed us before we set off again. We went into a huge mall where Yuqi and I had several photos taken with various amusing cartoon poses. After that, we decided that because of the scorching hot weather it would be a good idea to buy me some shorts. I'm somewhat larger around the waist than your average Chinese it would seem... so it took a lot of browsing to find the pair I'm wearing now. Otherwise we didn't buy very much - apart from a few gifts for you people back home. I'm not telling you what they are though, you'll need to wait and see :)  All that shopping occupied us into the evening. Yuqi and I wanted to treat Da Bao and family to a very special meal as a small token of our appreciation for all they've done for us over the last few days. A while ago I'd noticed Shen Yang's tallest building, the CCTV tower. At over 300m tall it's an impressive structure. What makes it even better, is that at the top it has two observation decks and a revolving restaurant - fantastic! The middle observation deck overlooks the city behind slanted glass windows looking down, it was an absolutely amazing sight seeing Shen Yang lit up at night as far as the eye could see. We also went to the top deck, which is open air. You can stand at the top at over 200m high (which is quite windy, my shirt kept inflating and showing everyone my beer belly) Again, it's a fantastic view - we had our photo's taken professionally for about 2 pounds because my digital camera doesn't handle the night view so well. We should see the photos after a week or so in the post. At one point I stood up against the safety rail and shouted at the top of my voice "Hello China!!"  At the bottom deck, we were seated in the revolving restaurant so we could dine while taking in the wonderful views. The entry price to the tower included the meal for 370 Yuan (about 30 pounds). The meal was large and tasty, and included some of my favourite dumplings and huge king prawns on skewers. I declined to taste the cow's stomach despite everyone reassuring me it was delicious ;)  After the meal, we had a look around some night market stalls before going back and flopping onto the bed.  That's all for now, I just forgot to mention I got my hair cut today as well. You'll see the results in the photos!
