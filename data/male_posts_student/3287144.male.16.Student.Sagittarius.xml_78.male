Yes that was all but its quite annoying, applauding a film when it starts... why? Who is going to hear your appreciation and be happy about it... the projectionist? Otherwise it wasn't so bad, a song by Counting Crows opening but then it was mostly covers of other songs - Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't 've?) by The Buzzcocks for example.  In other news I have been commissioned to work on another website! Yes, from doing websites on genealogy, to selling grass seeds my next project is for... my old secondary school! Well that's all I know as someone took the call for me and said I would be here so they should call then... but guess what? I'm not here tomorrow! So now I have to figure out how to answer a call when I am not there to take it.  Ideas?
