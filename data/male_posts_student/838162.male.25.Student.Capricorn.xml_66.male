It’s been awhile since I have been on a holiday out of town. Then again this should be concerned a working holiday since I will be helping to haul large loads of clothes for my mom’s home business. She mainly deals with female apparel but she’s looking into picking up some men’s stuff this time around. Anyone interested? Drop me a line. Maybe I can talk her into giving discounts :)  Another thing that has me excited is that this would be a great opportunity for me to make full use of my “new” digital camera. In fact, I remember making sure that I will get the camera especially for this trip. Will be sure to post some of the better shots when I get back. Really looking forward to getting some fancy and art shots over there. Will have to keep my eyes open.  Hoping to have a good time shopping. Clothes, games, little nick-nacks, anything goes. Of course I must remember to get some stuff for my friends as well. I know both  FeLee  and  LadyRaine  have made their requests quite well known.  *grins*  don’t worry guys, I won’t forget.  So until then…Have a good week and God Bless.
