Got a busy week from now on though, camping tomorrow and friday, then I have to go to school on saturday and meet my Aunt for a Barbecue afterwards, then on the Sunday I'm going to my firstever paintballing party...but if it's anything like Farcry I'll pwn at it! I may order some Ranma books later off Amazon, I love those books, they're so funny!
