I haven't watched  Left Behind  in a while, so someone let me know if this is a sign of the impending apocalypse.  We're only open from 1-5pm on Sundays, because they want to give us time to go to church. Well, my church service didn't get over until 12:00 pm. So I had to skip the opportunity to fellowship (Christian code for talk) to my friends so I could get to work by 12:30 to open the store. Is that really the church life we want to promote? Especially for a couple hundred bucks worth of business.
