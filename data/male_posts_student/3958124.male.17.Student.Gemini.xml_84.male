As you may (probably more like may not) have read, I hooked up some surround sound junk in my basement. Noah came over to experience  The Matrix  in surround before we left the house. In one simple word: awesome. Our destination, along with Travis's, was the Museum of Science. To see what? you might ask. To learn about sexual reproduction? Nay. To trip out in the planetarium on E? Double nay. To see  The Lord of the Rings  exhibit that features, among other things, dozens of pieces of armor, some actually worn by the cast, a Treewalker, and The One Ring? B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-o. The exhibit was sweet. We were allowed to touch a couple of swords, breathe on some of the costumes and actually  try on  some chain mail. They had a two gigantic cave trolls, both were touch-allowed. They had a goblin head, a bunch of bows, and  ::orgasmic girly shudders::  Legolas's clothes. Overall, worth the $19, considering they give you a ticket for general museum admittance that costs $14. After the museum, we hit up the Galleria, where we dined on the exquisite offerings of Panda Express. Following that, we saw the majestic streets of Harvard Square, then, as planned, went to Noah's for Chinese food and Kill Bill Vol. 2.
