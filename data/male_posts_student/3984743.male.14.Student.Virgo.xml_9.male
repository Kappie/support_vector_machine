Let us see...ummm...I don't get to go paintball again till my birthday, which is september 15th for those of you keeping score, which kinda sucks. I guess on a good note my mom has agreed to buy me about $100 worth of stuff I've been wanting for my gun, which is pretty kick ass if you ask me. It's also been decided by my girlfriend that I'm gonna move to portland with her, her best friend, and her best friends boy. It's gonna make for some great fun don't you think? I guess my only problem would be how I'm gonna go about doing the whole high school thing you know. I kinda want to stay here till I finish high school, but I'm not sure when we're all gonna be moving out to portland. Hopefully I won't have to go through the trouble of having to get through my mom and everything about me wanting to withdraw from school here, move out and have a life a thousand miles from here. I think she'll pull the whole I'm only 15-16 thing and therefore since I'm not an adult I can't be able to make my own choices and I have to stay here until I'm 18. I guess there is one thing about moving away from here I'm really gonna miss, and that is Tex-mex. God I don't know if I could live without some home cooked fajitas, no real tacos, all the queso I could shake a stick at. Maybe I'll have my mom send me some food every month so that way I don't have to deal with the cheap imitation stuff that they'll have up there, seeing as I don't think any real mexican cooks can afford or want to live all the way up there, too far from the motherland and all. Well I guess I'm done for now, so I'll leave you all with this.  Don't eat plastic doughnuts. You wanna know why? Cause it just ain't a good idea is why, trust me.
