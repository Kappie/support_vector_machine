PROCEDURE!!!!!! he spent the first 20 minutes going over how to start the car. Then he repeatedly asked me if I knew how to read English and if I knew the English language. That in itself was almost enough to make me storm out of the car insulted. I went on to have a so so lesson after this incident though but he still was a bit well crazy about the exact order of doing everything and saying certain things I was doing would make me fail the test when I knew it wasn't true. I did meet a cute Whitman girl named Jennifer. She was the person after me and when we talked after he got out to put some cones down we started talking and I believe we both hit it off pretty well. She is a sophomore, Chinese and it seems a bit of a language nerd (5+ languages). It was nice talking to her and I wish I could see her again sometime...    maybe over lunch perhaps? :-P
