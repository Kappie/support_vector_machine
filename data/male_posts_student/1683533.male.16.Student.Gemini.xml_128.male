Dammit.  I got a job!! Hope's Fish and Chips, I wash dishes...exciting i know...at least i am getting money...I need it pretty bad.  Spring break has sucked so far.  I said before this week the fun would start when we would have our band practice today.  Brandon wasnt home or something so we had to cancel, and i had a really boring day.  Maybe I can do something when Kate comes home tomorrow, I really miss that girl :(.  Where are my Vans? its been 3 weeks, so they should be coming any day now...I hope I get them before school starts up again, that would be nice.  I'm so bored, and I am waiting for something to happen...maybe i should just go to sleep...
