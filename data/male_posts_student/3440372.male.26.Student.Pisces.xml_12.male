At the moment I'm sitting in my room absolutely smashed out of my tiny little mind on very strong painkillers. One thing they never tell you at the hospital is that everything feels like plasticine after a certain number of little pills. My face, his desk, this glass, who said Holmes, these headphones and oh yes this plasticine! Still not entirely sure why I would want in weblog of what I will put in it. But I think I'm going to be disciplined and write in it everyday. So here goes kids (who am I talking to exactly) let's see what forms out of my head over the next couple of weeks
