I got my X-Box from England that I bought myself for $100 at the BX-brand new w/ 4 games, controller, DVD playback kit, etc. All because it was an air force base so everything is cheap. I cleaned up my room a little bit, updated my site, etc. I got some new clothes, money for my upcoming birthday (Jul.29)and tomorrow I'm going shopping for a backpack.
