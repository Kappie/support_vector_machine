Robbed my best friend of a mini-disc, which I gave back to him later.  My Poem:   T'was a silver moon that night  A hot summer night  A normal city night with crime, despotism and the occasional robbery  The bum in the corner enjoys giving fright to the nearby child named Diggory Out of fright he holds his mother tight Until they are out of the bum's sight  A businessman is returning home He gets on the N train Along with the Pizza Hut guy There is baby who cries The crying drives them all insane Then comes in the bum with the Trombone He sooths the baby to sleep Just figures that he isn't really a freak   Thank you. Thank you; don't try copying this poem for two reasons.   It sucks hot rancid balls of Hellhounds. I'll find you and stick a hot poker so far up your ass that you'll wish that you would have never been born.
