There was also a letter to the editor that unknowingly illustrates  urlLink white privilege  (at the bottom of the page).    I worry about writing these things, because it is difficult not to come off as insensitive.  I am a supporter of tolerance, and will verbally challenge any discrimination that I am privy to or even see on the street; few things upset me more than a barbed comment based on nothing more than a generic stereotype.  But the idea that we can teach kindness like we teach algebra is beyond me.  The campus is currently looking over initiatives to combat racial prejudice; one of them is education.    When I used to write debate cases in high school, we would often tie education to our solvency; we'd state the problem, why it was a big problem, and then we'd say that we would educate people in order to change the problem.  Since it was such a vague statement, it gave us a lot of leeway when negative teams would attack the idea of education.  "How can you be against education?" I remember saying many a time to a acne-stricken adolescent standing in a tan suit on the other side of a table.  Did I ever bother to think of how education would solve the problem?  No...because I never honestly thought it could, I only thought it sounded good.  Education initiatives often involve nothing more than pamphlets and rallies; pamphlets get thrown away, people don't go to the rallies.  Some people keep the pamphlets, and some people attend the rallies, but often they're the people that would've been there anyway, not the ones you are reaching out to.    I feel like most activists are into activism to feel better rather than change the world...I'm not naive enough to believe that the two are not mutually exculsive, so I understand that both are important byproducts.  But why stop at a rally?   urlLink Cultural Feminism  still boggles my mind...I see the point of creating community and creating heroes in areas where women are underrepresented, akin to Dava Sobel's work in finding the letters of  urlLink Suor Maria Celeste  in publishing  urlLink Galileo's Daughter ...empowerment is the catalyst to change.  But I  urlLink still don't see  how people can be satisfied with only creating heroes.  Maybe I am a results-oriented person, and can't look at feeling better as enough of a goal...maybe I feel good enough as it is.  But I want to see results...I'm tired of seeing gender and racial injustice carried out implicitly in our society.  If carrying a sign and going to a march is going to help change policy and attitudes, then I'll pick up the standard.  But if it's going to just make me feel better while the problem continues to fester, I'll use my energy on something else.  So don't hand me a pamphlet or show me a public service announcement or coddle me by holding a small rally.  Create a movement, govern that movement, and write out goals and demands that you want to see changed in the status quo.  Hold the marches to get more people together, and make the goals broad and large enough that even if people don't agree with you 100%, you're all in favor of the general idea and not squibbling over minutae.  Then hold the biggest damn rally imaginable, and market it as the one rally...bring everyone together, get celebrities on board, and hold it.  Make a big splash...not a bunch of little ones.  Think about the movement, not the friends you might meet and weed you might smoke.    I'll tackle white privilege later...I'm sure it'll come up again.
