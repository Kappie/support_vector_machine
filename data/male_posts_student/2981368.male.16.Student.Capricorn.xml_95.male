I watched a really weird movie today. Galaxy Quest. God knows why...basically a bunch of actors from a crappy 80's sci-fi show meet a bunch of aliens who had watched these 80's shows and thought they were 'historical documents' and so based their whole civilisation on it.   At this point I'm thinking "...what...the...fuck..."  Somehow the movie turned out worse than I expected. The main 'bad guys' all looked like the Grinch wearing spikey metal plating. And there was a cliche-ridden thing with a short-term time travel device.   *urrghh...unclean!*  In the good news...  - Bristol City beat Hartlepool last night in the div 2 playoff 2nd leg...was 1-0 Hartlepool until the 88th minute, when Marc Goodfellow headed home an equaliser. Then Christian Roberts scored a blinder in the 3rd minute of added time to win the game. WOOHOO! GO CITY!  - Calgary beat San Jose 3-1 in the Saddledome last night to secure their place in the Stanley cup final. Jarome "Legend with a cool name" Iginla scored his 10th goal these playoffs on a powerplay at the end of the 1st period. Martin Gelinas followed up with a goal midway through the 2nd, before McCauley pulled one back for the Sharks. With less than half a minute to play, San Jose pulled their goalie, only for Regehr of the Flames to whack the puck right from one end of the rink to the other for an empty-net goal. With  1 second  left on the clock. GO FLAMES!!!  - Looks like Tampa Bay are going to beat off the Flyers. Woohoo again.  - I managed to find my citizenship source booklet. Pity half the stuff in it is scribbled on. Bah. Good thing you get a new one in the exam. And it should be an easy subject to pass anyways.  Ahh, that'll do for now. Wish me luuuuuuck! ('cos I'll probably need iiiiiit...)
