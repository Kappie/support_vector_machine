This is good new for fantasy owners and for Braves fans.  Good second basemans are hard to come by so Giles having a great second half can definitely help your fantasy team.   Magglio Ordonez (OF, White Sox):  Has returned from the DL and should be back in your lineup.  Last year he hit an impressive .317 with 95 runs, 29 homeruns, 99 RBIs, and 9 stolen bases.   Bill Mueller (3B, Red Sox):  Returned from the DL and has been doing his best to make up for lost time going 10 for 25 since his return. He has returned to form and raised his average 12 points already.  Hitting before Nomar and Mr. David Ortiz cant be  so  bad...  Hitting in the middle of the crazed Boston lineup is stat heaven.   Eric Chavez (3B, A’s):  Returned from the DL and will slot right back into the A’s offense.  Not only one of the best defensively, but "Chavvy" is also one of the best hitters in the game today.  Last week, after returning from the DL, he posted 4 runs, 2 RBIs, and is batting .500(6 for 12).   Carlos Delgado (1B, Blue Jays):  Returned from the DL after missing more than a month.  Disappointedly, he was my 1st round pick, but hopefully he'll live up to his status.  Last year he put up remarkable numbers- 117 runs, 42 homeruns, and an ML leading 145 RBI's.   Preston Wilson (OF, Rockies):   He's off to a slow start from coming off the DL, but he's soon to come around.  Last year he had very similar stats to of Carlos Delgado, and hitting in Coors Field can definitely help...   Livan Hernandez (SP, Expos):   The Bad News Bears(Expos) are nowhere near they need to be in the NL East, with a 31-56 record, and 15 games out of first, trade rumors have been hovering over this one time World Series MVP.  One trade rumor says that Hernandez may go to the New York Yankees.  That's a nice lil' jump there...last to first...   AJ Burnett (SP, Marlins): After coming off the DL because of Tommy John surgery, he got tee-ed off having a 5+ ERA, but last month has changed that.  In June, he got 1 win, with a 2.95 ERA, 0.93 WHIP, and 28 K's in 36.2 innings.   Mark Teixeira (1B/3B/OF, Rangers):  Has been slaughtering the ball and has 6 home runs in the last 12 games and has raised his average 22 points in that span. This is more like it and is closer to the real Teixeira than the guy who was hitting just .254 two weeks ago. He’s on pace to flirt with 40 home runs.  Also, hitting behind Soriano, Michael Young, and Hank Blalock will help that RBI total.   Edgar Renteria (SS, Cardinals): Not exactly off to an All Star year, Renteria's luck hasn't came yet.  If you were to watch the ESPN Webgems, you would probably see Renteria the one being robbed of a hit.  The whole year he has been hitting the ball hard, and has been getting solid line-drive hits, but getting robbed.  The second half should be better for him, especially with the possible MVP Scott Rolen and the red hot HR machine Jim Edmonds hitting behind him.   Jose Reyes (SS, Mets): Does anyone remember the second half he had last year? He hit .339 and stole 11 bases.  The Mets hitting has been great the past month and Jose Reyes has been one of the reasons.   Joe Mauer (C, Twins): He was supposed to be a total stud in the majors, but an injury stopped that from happening, well at least for the 1st half of the season.  Fresh legs from the All Star break will benefit this young star.     "Goin' Down Town"     Kevin Youkillis (3B, Red Sox): Has lost the majority of his playing time since Bill Mueller returned from the DL.   Frank Thomas (1B, White Sox): Was placed on the 15 day DL with inflammation of his right ankle - due to bone chips. This might be a lot more serious than noted especially because of the strain that ankle takes just moving the big guy around and surgery which could end his season.   Jose Jimenez (RP, Free Agent): Jimenez was given his release from the Indian organization as a failed stint as closer. He’ll land somewhere but his role as a closer is probably long gone.  Look for Bob Wickman, the possible new closer for the Cleveland Indians.   Josh Beckett (SP, Marlins): Was once again placed on the 15 day DL with blister problems.  In his starts getting a blister, he's gone 5 strong innings, but then the blister occurs.  If Jack McKeon were smart, he'd put Beckett as a RP.  How does a Beckett-Benitez duo sound?   Melvin Mora (3B, Orioles): Has been placed on the 15 day DL with a hamstring injury.  He's not exactly known for his second half performance either.  Last year he barely hit over .200 in the second half.  (TRADE HIM!!!)   Adrian Belte (3B, Dodgers): Despite his first half performance, Beltre probably wont be able to end strong.  Typically, he is a second half hitter, but his ankle injury can counter that.   Ken Griffey JR. (OF, Reds): Not much to say.  He's injured again(Oh, you knew it was going to happen eventually)...
