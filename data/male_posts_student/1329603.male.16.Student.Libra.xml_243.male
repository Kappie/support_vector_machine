Had the senior drama group party today. That was fun. The time went whoosh but still, was good. Woo. I got cake, so yay. I was also... fairly loud...  My eyes are painfully dry.  I have maltesers.  Left hand drive, £3,420.  Quote of the day: "And my life is lost, my battle not won, The rain comes again and the sun has not shone. Yet here I stand firm, my faith at my feet. I've come far too far to lose to defeat."  From   This Life   what I wrote   Love, Jon Roskilly
