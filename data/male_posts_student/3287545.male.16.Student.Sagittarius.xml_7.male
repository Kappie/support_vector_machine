I didn’t send the letter, and it’s now really pissing me off. If I was going to send it it had to be done of Thursday, Friday absolute latest, but I didn’t have a stamp, and if I ask my parents they will omly demand to know what I want it for. So I’ll go back tomorrow and she’ll be waiting their in the D block to kiss me and I really don’t want this relationship to go on any longer. After what I’ve been thinking and saying to myself recerntly I really can’t see how I could go to school and continue to go out with her. I can’t say it to her face, it’s just to hard for me. That leaves mail or email. Using email to break up with someone, especially someone who is in love with you is not good. Mail is my only option but when do I post it? I think my best option will be Thursday night/Friday morning so it will arrive on Saturday. That way I don’t have to see her the next day at school. But then perhaps that would be the better idea. If I post it tomorrow it will arrive Wednesday and I can confront her at school Wednesday/Thursday/Friday and get over it. Or maybe I should just give it to her and tell her to read it when she gets home. If I give it to her on Monday last period in IT, just when were leaving, then she will be forced to read it at home. Then Tuesday I wont have to confront her until lunch. There, that seems the best idea. That also gives me a couple of opportunities to have a conference with Amy, I really need to confide in someone about this. On Thusday me and mum went to Freeport and I bought a couple more tops. I need to make sure I’ve got lots to wear so that when I go to school I non-uniform for the next month or so I don’t look like the ‘dirty’ kid. I’m now not so sure the two new tops I bough are that great. I got a brown one which in heinseight was perhaps not a great colour to choose and a white short sleeved top which was also not to good because it’s a little big and short sleeves really don’t suit me. Oh, well. Tomorrow I will be wearing my calvin-klein jeans with probably my optitions top and beige shows. So, I should look good hopefully. My spots are going down quite nicely so as long as I don’t start binging on chocolate as soon as I go back I should have a nice clean face, and the facial mask I’m using at the moment makes my skin really smooth so hopefully when I go back to school next week I should be really lookin good. On Wednesday me Lloyd and jack went to la cinema (en francais) and we saw Shaun of the Dead which was really very good. We also plaid quasar (dunno how to spell that) which was fun, although I came second last in my team (of 7). Since then I’ve been tryin to revise, got my GCSE’s coming up in a few months, less than that even, but I just can’t seem to get going with it, just so boring. Right that’s enough for now, I’m gonna have a go at doing some revision and homework.
