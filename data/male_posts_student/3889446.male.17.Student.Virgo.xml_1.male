In the last month I have been learning the Kana signs and I have been listening to alot of J-pop/J-rock. I'm trying to adopt their taste of music but it isn't always that easy since the music is really different (apart from the language). But there is a huge range of music: japanese music industry is the second biggest in the world. You get used to it after some time. I didn't learn  that  much of Japanese yet, besides some expressions and useful phrases. But not enough to have a conversation. When school is over (which will be in ten days), I will be able to fully concentrate on Japanese.  I really can't wait getting there. I got an e-mail from the daughter of my first host family, Noriko, yesterday. It was really sweet. Her English seems good enough to understand each other. She said she wanted to send me a picture of her class and friends. So I'm really looking forward to see that.  Greetings
