You know who are good? Kalmah. You know who else are good? Norther. And Children of Bodom. And Soilwork. And In Flames. I suggest you check out ALL of them bands whatever music you are into, it's so insatiable. Maybe I should go now. I am so bored, and tired... and I have a LOT of homework to do. Grrr...
