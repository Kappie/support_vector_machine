WOaH   That kinda speaks of everything that I'm feeling now as I sit inside my meat on my chair at home, while my  !C0N  is creating for the first time, my very first post on this my first humble blog.  Welcome to everyone with me on this an attempt to share my thoughts, views, hopes, dreams, fears, joys, failures and likes and dislikes on this journey that we call life towards the Edgeless Horizon. In case you haven't noticed, I seem to have written everything in some cyber, uber-l33t sci-fi kinda of style. It is not a theme of particular choice, but kinda something I like to use and sometimes even think in (readme:geek!).  Frankly I have made this as much for myself as it is for everyone else.  Therefore thank you on making my dive through the datalines less lonely.......
