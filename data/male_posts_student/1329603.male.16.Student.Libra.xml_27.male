I'll go back soon and start warming up the trombone, but for the minute I'm fiddling with my blog. So hoorah.  I burned my hand a bit, the hot water tap was... well... hot. Seems logical enough but as a general rule hot water taps either don't work or run cold water. So I burned my hand. Hoorah.  Anyway, Swedish. Swedish? Franzosich, my good man. NORRRRRRRRRRRRRM. Toyota? Toyota Corolla. Avensis Corolla Psiren. Psiren, siren, noise, light, let there be light, church, building, rock, earth, wind, fire, water. Water daughter. Excalibur. Sword, death, life. Birth. Humanity, settlers, nationality. Swedish. Swedish?  Right, really bored as you can probably tell. I'll be on later. Ciao for now. POW. Etc.  Love, Jon Roskilly
