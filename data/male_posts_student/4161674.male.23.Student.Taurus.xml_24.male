It sounds real entertaining, and I imagine it will go over better than your alternate plan of just pointing a camera at an aquarium for an hour.  If ideas are that hard to come by in Hollywood, I would like to offer my services as a television executive. I have a wonderful concept I want to discuss with you that would have the Fox Sports Team providing color commentary for the Pillsbury Bakeoff.  Describing your network programming as "a vast wasteland" sounds like I'm damning you with faint praise.  IAN  P.S. Hope you aren't planning on winning the February Sweeps.
