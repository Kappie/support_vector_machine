But yeah, this is complete well.. shinyness. I mean, the banner at the top is sorta.. annoying *poke poke*  But, hey, I'll get used to it. And, I'll try to update this sucker as much as heavenly possible, trust me, I'm easily bored, and, when you bore me, and, add google, well.. you get me hunting down Invader Zim yaoi jsut to see if it exists, not a pretty sight.  But, yeah, it's nice to be on blogger, It'll take me a bit to get used to navigating it, but, hey, I pick up on things quickly, I should be zoomin about in no time.   -Teh Bret  Wishing that silly little gothic girls would stop having Zim anal probe Dib.
