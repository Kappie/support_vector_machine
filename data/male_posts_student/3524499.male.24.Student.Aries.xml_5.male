Policy distribution database contains policy entries, interface, destination E.	Difference between VPN and normal i.	VPN; distribution is logical, it has logical meaning and does not concern physical  2.	Issues A.	How to maintain database B.	How to make it secure C.	How to setup and maintain  3.	We can use transport mode because it is dynamic  4.	We need to  A.	find out the operation difference between VPN distribution of policy and normal TCP/UDP routing B.  find out how to setup and maintain C.  find out how to make it secure D.  Need Nortel  5.  Website: www.oliverpriest.com/project      with Steve  1.	Methodology of project A.	Think flexibility; UML etc  2.	About VPN; A.	IIPtran has dynamic routing solution Does it adjust distribution? See cryptograph for key distribution B.	Policy distribution i.	Key_length ii.	Route High level policy; distributed one is human readable Specify GUI etc We concern only secure part We can ignore broader policy  3.	Policy about policy? A.	Who set up the policy B.	Authentication  4.	See “Askenti” www-itg.lbl.gov/Akenti 5.	IPSec A.	In gateway B.	In endpoint(host) C.	But here we have dynamic. Router is in somewhere in network. So? D.	Distribution is about routing information E.	Distribution can be normal routing protocol to get and push  6.	Implementation A.	Test it college LAN B.	So implementation is only for demonstration for one project which means we can do part of it  7.	Idea A.	We want to have dynamic routing protocol that has policy inside saying that how it is routed, pushed, parsed, etc in secure way B.	Solve dynamic routing C.	Policy specification D.	Do it in secure way  8.	Summary A.	Think about “policy of policy” B.	Write down all the problems; don’t expect too much C.	Think as critical D.	Do the project management E.	Look at RFC F.	Read more about Manish’s work G.	About problem, understand what is there, what can be, and what is solved already      with our own group  About project A.  Overview; Olly B.  Objectives; Olly C.
