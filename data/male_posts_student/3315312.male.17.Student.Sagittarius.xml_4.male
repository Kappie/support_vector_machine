On this blog we hope to offer some incisive, cutting, and always entertaining political point-counterpoint on all the relevant issues of the day.  Everything from policy in Iraq to Whether Bush looks like a monkey will be covered and then, if you feel like it, discussed ad nauseum by you.  All comments are welcome by everyone (even if you're an anonymous coward) and all opinions will be respected.  Hopefully this'll turn out great and we'll be able to work this summer and next school year.  Viva la Revolucion!  Tomorrow, the Iraqi prison torture, what does it mean?
