I came home at 2:00 so thats when I started, and well I was also watching tv at the same time .. SIMPSONS!! ... :P :D ..  Anyways, stoopid vga fan, it sounds like a continous mosquito humming in your ear .. grrrrr .. grrrrr .. .grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr .. and .. then again ... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I tried to clean it .. (coz thats the reason its making the sound i guess .. tooooo much dirt .. :P) but, I couldnt find the right screw driver to unscrew it with .. :( :P and then aah well .. I am too lazy to go find one .. I can bear the noise i guess .. :P  Why I am awake, coz i think its better i pray and go to sleep. And what to do .. hmmm .. lemme think .. hmmmm .... hmmmm .... noones online. Counterstrike is working on a horridly low resolution .. and i cant set it up coz i dont know the console commands.
