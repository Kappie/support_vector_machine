I was sweaty all over and the air con in my room made the condition worse....I just have a fever. I was grumbling within myself, with an inner expression of self-inflicting pain. I knew it! I can't go to Ngee Ann Poly today. So, I switched on my trusty computer and went online.  After many hours of surfing, I went to the doctor and he gave me some pills ( Paracetemol and Febricol ) and some tablets of Vitamin C. Well, I guess my immune system is weak. Hmmm....it was like " A huge army of Orcs against a brigade of human footmen ".  I went to sleep around 1.00pm, went online and chat with some friends. Took out my CD-ReadOnlyMemory and went to JunWen's house. My first impression of his house was a pig sty, so I hope I won't see that again. But I was wrong..so wrong. The mess got worse today. His house was in a mess. Shirts and Pants were seen lying around the house like dead bees sprayed by a can of insecticide.  I reformatted his OS and voila, got it to work again. Stayed his house till 7.30pm and went home. Took some medicine and studied A.Maths for an hour and went online again ( net addiction?! ).  Hehe.. I think that's all for today.
