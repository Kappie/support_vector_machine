Bethesda licensed the rights to the Fallout� franchise from Interplay Entertainment Corp. (OTC Bulletin Board: IPLY) in a deal that awards Bethesda exclusive worldwide rights to the Fallout� franchise on the PC, home consoles, handhelds, and other media, with the option to develop and publish additional sequels."   Well, if you ask me that's just awsome news!  I love the Fallout games.  And Bethesda's really good at making awsome stuff.  Morrowind was one of the greats.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this.
