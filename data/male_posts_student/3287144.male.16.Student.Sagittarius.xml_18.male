Today I had my German speaking exam it didn't go too bad apart from the following mistakes I made;   ∙ I eat pizza for breakfast.  ∙ I don't go swimming in the swimming pool; I go swimming in the river Rhine.  ∙ My father is dead. [He isn't]  In a bitter irony though I have since been told that my  grand father has two months to live: On Monday he was admitted to hospital, on Tuesday he was diagnosed with cancer, on Wednesday they operated and now it is Thursday and he has two months to live.  It's a common question, but what does one do if they are told they have two months to live? I don't really know, but surely if we do  live  then there is nothing to be done, just to carry on with our lives until something does happen? For example by going around the world on holiday, aren't we saying that we haven't lived and now we are trying to get something back that we lost? Could it not also be said that we are giving up - admitting that we're beaten, a doctors judgment our death sentence?
