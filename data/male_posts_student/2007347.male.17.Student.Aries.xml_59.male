Its not a very long game, so I would advise to just borrow it, not to buy it. Even Simon liked it, and he's more of a RPG DD type of guy. Never got on well with the 1st person shooters. I had already finished it on Computer, and he had an Xbox. As such, my skills needed some training, its hard to snipe with that accursed joystick. Before, I was pulling tight ass moves with the mouse using very little ammo, now i had to go for the more trigger happy weapons like the Ingrams or the M1 Carbine. Of course the favourite is the MP5, decent clip size and decent aim, though the Desert Eagle was a fair bit of fun, But make sure you use it in bullet time, since as we all know DEs have a very small magazine size. Don't worry if that didn't make any sense, if it did, i think you'll love this game. The Best part is the story, built in the comic book, film noir feel, a genre that was popular back in the 30's. But the graphics are beautiful, even though the atmosphere is rather bleak and grim, you have to admit it that the realism of the graphics had a certain charm. Let me put it this way, we spent 5 minutes watching Max jump so we could see the realistic waving of his trenchcoat.  Max Restecpa.
