My T.A. is this kick ass english phd candidate who went back to school after fifteen years in the real world. He makes me think of a better looking(sort of hot, in an english way) version of micheal palin. The professor is some dougie howser phd candidate who looks like a highschooler in a suit, but he seems knowledgable.  I am so happy, my favorite online journal is back. Everyone should check it out at thesouthlondondiaries.co.uk no better understanding of the humor and sadness of this world we live in.l Plus drew is just plain funny
