I was dreading the fact that I would not only go to school, but to soccer as well which meant I would probably not get home until after 18:00.  That's 6 pm if you don't speak European.  So I went to school and fortunately it is the end of the year, which means work is at a minimum.  I did have to take a Spanish test however.  It wasn't very hard for a change.  Math was certainly fun though.  All I did was grade Geometry papers.  When school was over I went home and took an hour and a half nap.  Yes, life is good.  One more thing about yesterday and it's a good thing.  I went to the girl's soccer game and was treated to a 5-0 Marian win over Crete-Monee.  It was a well played game all around.  I was impressed with the goals we scored.  Hard work, good teamwork, and a deft shot gave us a well deserved five-nil rout against an archrival.  It was a good result considering they bounced back from a disappointing 5-0 loss to Homewood-Flossmoor.  Well done.  Good luck in the playoffs.
