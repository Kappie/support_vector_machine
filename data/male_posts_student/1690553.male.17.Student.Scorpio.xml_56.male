The paper supposed to take only 3 hours to complete but we are confined to the computer lab for a whole stretch of 6 hours from 8am to 2pm! This is because of so many special procedures for this particular paper, especiallly regarding data verification. Each answers in digital form is made into three copies and will be send to the Examination Board by several ways. The primary method is by FTP upload, then we have CDs and lastly diskettes. The files are also saved in the PC we used just in case all the copies corrupted. One school in Jerantut, Pahang had all their student's files corrupted due to virus. So you pretty had to depend on the reliability of the PC in order to excel. Despite all the measures taken to ensure the files intergrity, Raimy had his Visual Basic coding corrupted and Khairil also lose some of his files.  After completed the paper I drop-by at the post office to pay the water bill and send a mail to my uncle in Labuan. Bought a new Rabbani CD at Speedy Video Kuantan Parade titled Kenangan Lalu (Past Memories). It's a 2 CD compilation album which compiles all their hit songs from all album except Qiblat. Noticed that Qiblat and Kenangan Lalu had different labels. Qiblat is under Intifada Studios while Kenangan Lalu is still under EMI. Guess that EMI made this album to remembers Rabbani that had left them and set up their own Intifada Studios. It's a good move, following what Hijjaz had done.  - Sound of  Intifada  by  Rabbani  -
