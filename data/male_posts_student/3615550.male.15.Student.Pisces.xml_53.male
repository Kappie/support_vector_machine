I am using Window's ME (have I mentioned that yet?), and even though I have switched browsers, I still don't have any formatting buttons.  I'm not a big fan of this Firefox stuff either; it seems a little slow.    I deleted all of my cookies, so there's nothing wrong there.  Life's just hard.  I will continue to look for a way to fix my publishing problems, so maybe I can get back to being the Neo that you know and love.  Expect a new post from me soon, as I am currently working on a post that doesn't involve any links.  I will also look for ways to work around my lack of publishing buttons, as well as possible ways to fix my problem.  Let's start by seeing if my scant HTML lingo is still usable:   TEST    TEST   Uh, yeah; that's all I can remember at this late hour.  My parents are telling me to get in bed, so I figure I should oblige them.  Be blessed! Neo
