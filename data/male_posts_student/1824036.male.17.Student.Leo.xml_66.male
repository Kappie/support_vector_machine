We live about an hour and a half from the ice arena and it was a nice car ride up there. We listened to some of the Bob and Tom show Justin had on a CD and whatnot. We get to Ames and eat at Hickory Park. It is an awesome restaurant. The food is great, the service is great, etc. etc. I dont think that there was anything wrong with this restaurant at all. It was all pretty affordable too!!! I had a chicken sandwich, with a chocoate shake for dessert.  After that we went into a Wal-Mart in Ames just to waste a little bit of time. I was walking around looking at something to buy to bide my time at home on the weekend. I was really leaning towards getting another pro wrestling figure like I had begun to collect in the late 90's but opted not to due to the cost, $7.50 (up over $2 from 2 years ago). Just as I was leaving Justin said, "LOOK!" And he pointed right at a replica modle of the  urlLink WWE Cruiserweight Title Belt . I started to drool as I awed at it. "I must have that!" I declared.  So I decided to buy the belt (for a little too much if you ask me). But the whole rest of the night (except at the hockey game) I was screaming "I AM THE CHAMPION!!!"  The hockey game was everything that I dreamed of, from the goalie heckling, to the chants, to the cheap food/drinks, to the awesome atmosphere. Despite the loss (8-3) I still had a great time. I also plan to go back some time soon!
