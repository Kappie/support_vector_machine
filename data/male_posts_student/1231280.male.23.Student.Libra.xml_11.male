They got it tonight by beating Butler in the Horizon final. Finally, my Dad can be proud of the school he graduated form. So fuckin' awesome. Spring Break and another trip to Milwaukee is only a short 3 days away, but this time it's all about partying hard. Mid Term on Thursday, turn in this paper, and we're off to watch the Lakers vs. the Bucks, and drink plenty of Miller products. It'll be one crazy time. That's pretty much it for now.....back to writing.....
