Already the mention of my name has probably caused some readers who have read my previous blogs swiftly exit and run away with a great sense of self preservation. I assure everyone that I will keep this blog to its purpose and leave any mindless mutterings to my other blogs.  I truly do read a substantial amount of books so this blog may eventually have some useful material.
