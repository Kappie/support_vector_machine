Little does he know, but it's not coffee you smell every morning, but the porno mags you keep hidden under your bed!  It's Official! Tori Spelling is getting married! Upon hearing the news, her boyfriend from the hit show, 90210, Brian Austin Green, congratulated Spelling and then went back to playing Nintendo with Screech!  The gay American community has stated that John Kerry and his Presidential running partner, John Edwards, are the most gay-friendly candidates in American history. Upon hearing the news, Kerry pulled Edwards aside and said "You complete me."  In entertainment news, Britney Spears and her dancer fiance have yet to pick the date for the wedding... because they are still trying to pick the date for their divorce!  In family news, you let a fart go that was so violent and so deadly that you couldn't even blame it on the dog. Oh no, you had to take full credit for this one and gloat about it for weeks and as a result, you are now banned from the living room. P.S. It was worth it!  Until next time...  CK out!
