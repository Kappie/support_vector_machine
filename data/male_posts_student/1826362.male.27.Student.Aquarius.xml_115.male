I found out that   urlLink "All Temple undergraduate students taking12 credit hours or more and graduate students taking 9 hours or more are automatically assessed a student recreation fee per semester. This fee entitles you to use the ibc Student Rec Center, the Student Pavilion, and Pool 30 in Pearson Hall.  All others must pay a recreation user fee."  I even called the fitness center and asked if I needed to fill out any paperwork or pay any additional fees.  the answer was, "no, not as long as you are registered for 9 or more credits."  Since I am regisetered for 9 or more credits, I went to the gym this morning in my gym stuff.  I handed over my id to be scanned to gain entrance to the gym, and was told that I haven't paid my student recreation fee.  But I have, i insisted, i was charged $150 in fees, I have my card right here that proves I paid my activities fee. "that's a different fee.  this is a recreation fee.  if you're not registered for 9 credits, you have to pay the fee." But, I  am  registered for 9 credits. "oh," clickity clikcity clack "you are a center city student, your'e not registered on the main campus.  you have to be registered for 9 credits at the main campus." But I'm  not  a center city student, I'm in a regular program at the regular campus.  Last semester all my classes were at the main campus; this semester two are downtown, and one is at the main campus. "yeah.  you're a center city student.  you'll have to pay the fee" can I pay the fee now? or can you add it to my bill? "no, you have to go to the bursar's office, they won't let us take money here." So after a trip to the bursar's office to pay another fee, and a trip to the student recreation administrative office to sign waivers, I trucked off to the gym. Hah!  take that Temple!  your beurocracy cannot thwart my fitness efforts!  I laugh at your multiple dispersed offices!  I pshaw at your assesment of fees! I am unstoppable! I do wonder, though, if I couldn't pay a fee at the gym, why could I pay one at the computer center when I picked up my antivirus software?  I don't think the computer center is the bursar's office, so why can they add a fee to my bll, when the gym can't hmmmm?
