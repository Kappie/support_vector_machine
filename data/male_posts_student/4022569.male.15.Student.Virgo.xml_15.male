She had said she had a crush on me before, and when flirting began to move to a bit more obvious level I had to wonder does she like me then I realized you can't ask that question if you don't like them thus I succumb to that fact that I was yet again smitten with some hidden, one-sided romance with my best friend. There's nothing wrong with her she's gorgeous, smart, an awesome listener, and talker, and loads of fun just to be with. Ok so this is the part that should be simple. Lydia's X boyfriend has lied to her, numerous things she told him not to (i.e. drugs,and alcohol) broken up with her multiple times causing her to call me late at night crying. And all those times I thought to my self, "The difference between him and me is that I could actually love you." I can't see What it is about him, But if it's just the fact that she's already comfortable with him that's a lame reason. I don't what to do cause this time it's not as easy as the first. I fall asleep thinking of her. I wake just find my self tangled up in thoughts about her and I wonder if she's waking up then too.  Moral: Behind every  simple attraction  there is a complicated relationship.  Kramer, Out!
