I don't know what to feel or think about anything - it's so complicated I can't even make out if it actually is complicated or not (when I think about it ought to fit someone simpleminded) and thus explains it with this crap. Blah, like anyone will ever read this anyway. I mean there are like millions and billions of different guinea pigs on this site. By signing up you doom yourself to eternal walling (new verb created by YOURS TRULY, meaning "talking to a wall"). Getting back on track; ARGH HELP ME! MAKE SOMETHING GOOD OUT OF ME! Please I beg you, yes you american human being, adapt me to your stinking society of useless skin blocks that resemble me (but better)... I, seriously, beg you! OK, this time, getting back on the real, solid, preferably metal track! Geez, there's no track nor spoon here... just shoot me, or worse condemn me to eternal blogging (walling) on this site! The horror... the horror...
