Eventhough it was no use unwrapping them because first of all they weren't for me and I couldn't do anything with the gifts after opening them.  But over all I am so happy to see that our baby is so much loved even before coming into this world, can't imagine after she has arrives she will be spoiled completely.  I think I will be the bad guy in parenting because Dharmesh is going to do whatever she wants, she will have him dance on her fingers (not unless I can help it). :o)  The party was great but I did not like the baby shower ritual (i dont know how to spell "baby shower" in hindi - God-Bharai). Anyhow, I liked the idea of walking down the stairs on Saree which seemed like walking on Red Carpet, but I did not like the slapping seven times tradition (that kinda hurts and a little insulting).  Its like I am getting punished for getting pregnant..hehehe !!  I think I have to ask my Mother-in-Law about this but I am sure I wont like the explaination.    Oh well, besides that I caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't wait till our baby is born.  Hopefully dharmesh will start setting up Ria's room this weekend, since I cant pick up anything myself (I am helpless).  I want my baby's room to be light purpleeeeee, Ok dharmesh !? Eventhough Ria will sleep in our room first couple of months then in Mom's room so no need to set up the baby's room but I want to do something for my baby before it arrives.  Will see !  Thats it for today will write more tomorrow.
