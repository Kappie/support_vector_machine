Pero pare, hayskul pa yun. nakaraan na yun. But I can't blame you. The question is --- Do you always see her on your mind as if it was just yesterday? Are there times that you seem sleepless thinkin' of somethin related to the opposite sex??? If the answer is a resounding yes, then you got to have GIRLFRIEND, a.s.a.p.!!! Defense mechanism natin yang mga lalake na nagsasabing kailangan na nating makihalubilo sa opposite sex. Not necessarily for lust or sex, but for the wonderful experience that we will miss lest we be a wood to chuck by a woodchuck... What I mean is the puppy love, true love, happiness, arguments, jealousy, opinions, blah blah that we will miss in our lifetime... I say, go get a girl you fancy. Date her. Analyze her (Not that kind, sicko). Check her background and her attitude in life. And if you like her, good. If she likes you as well, then you have made the first important base. And the rest is all up to you. Be good to her, but not damn too good that you are being a wussy and a puppy on leash. Have your own identity. Be damn funny, be a little cocky (not too much), be smart, be confident, be kalogz, do smell good and have clean nails, and the best of all, be human (a nice human that is). Now about them girls, don't take advantage or get taken advantaged by them . don't expect too much from them (especially from our generation, you know what I mean). Be prepared to love. Be prepared to get hurt. All of these, we have to start from something, you know...... Oh and do watch out for players (aka "playa's"). Get away from them as soon as you can see a hint and some proof of it. They'll just waste your time. You know them once you can feel and see skeletons in their closets...Now go get 'em!   Catchall'l8ter.
