Had a friend last yr hu got moved from CTO bak 2 CSO, didnt realise that that actually happened until it happened 2 him.  He was so pissed off he left lol.   Moan time.  3 things:  1) Y is my post so slow? Sum ppl got their results on Wednesday, n here i am waitin til friday!  2) Y dont they put where ur theyve placed u in the orchestra on th letter?  Even jus an indication of 1st or 2nd violins would help.  Wud make so much more sense than makin every1 crowd around 1 tiny notice on th 1st rehearsal, n also it wud allow ppl 2 deal wiv their dissappointment/elation in a private place instead of in front of everybody.  Stupid ppl.  3) Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo its Mr leech!  I knew it was gonna b, but was hopin my source was mistaken!  Evil man.  Jus hope he doesnt know about this page lol.
