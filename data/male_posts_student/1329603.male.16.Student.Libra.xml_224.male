I'm going to probably regret putting this in but I'm over-tired and as such my head is a bit swosh.  I really need you at the moment. I'm so bloody tired and the fact that I'm advancing in so much isn't helping; I'm moving too fast, without anything constant by my side. I just want a sensitive hand entwined with mine, an arm around me just to let me know the world is still existing. I don't need love. Love hurts. I just need you to be there.  Who is that adressed to? Make up your own mind. It can be to whomever you would like it to be to. I'm not sure I know 100% who it's to.
