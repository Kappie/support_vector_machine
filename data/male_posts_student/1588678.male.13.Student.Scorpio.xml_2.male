Adult Swim is basically a combination of comedy catroons that were cancled. Some of those cartoons are; Sealab 2021, Futurama, Brak, Family Guy and other cartoons. They're all funny as hell! The only downfall to Adult Swim is that Sealab 2021 and Brak are on once a week and are on at midnight, but Futurama and Family Guy are on at 11:00 (p.m.).   So, if you catch yourself wondering, "What the hell happened to Sealab 2021?!" Know you know. I'm almost positive Adult Swim is on Cartoon Network. You should defiantly check it out.
