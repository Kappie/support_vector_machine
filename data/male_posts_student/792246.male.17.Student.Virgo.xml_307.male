This doesn't really affect my GPA in any significant way, but I thought it was cool.  So bored. I really feel like people are avoiding hanging out with me, except for one or two people who aren't here. So, yeah. I'm clearly the most unfortunate person ever.  I'm so incredibly over Bret, but my subconscious won't let it die! fheuhfawqj99u39rf. Yes. I go days and weeks and months without even thinking about him, but he is still in my dreams doing random things without my permission! He was a waiter at a restaurant in Tibet last night. I think he was a Fed. He's probably stalking me through my dreams. Well, in my dreams, I'm the wizard master.  And this other guy who I had a brief interest in a few months ago IMed me today to ask me something which he seemed to really care about my answer to. This was awkward because what ultimately made me lose interest in this guy, aside from his horribly appalling taste in friends, was the way he would seem to show no interest me. This was the first time  ever  that he IMed me, as opposed to me starting to bug him and he just typing generic boring badly grammatized responses. So then I didn't see him for like what, months? and here he was trying to keep up a conversation. It was awkward. But in a disconnected and unimportant way.  *barf*
