Ed is a very very good kisser too.  He tells me that he has never kissed.. but he is really good, so I dont know if I believe that or not.. JK! We watched the first one.. Van Housing or something like that.. me and Ed didnt understand it very much and we HONESTLY was trying to understand.. the 2nd movie was The Dawn of the Dead.. I only remember about 10-20 minutes in the begining b/c I fell asleep in Ed' very comfy arms.  it was a great night, it was chilly when we left eachothers arms but when we were together we were fine.  The stars were out and it was very clear night.. Hey Ed.. you see the Ship?!?!? (inside joke). I got home at 2:20 am and my mother was a little upset about me getting home so late.. I told her that we left as soon as the movie was over.  cuz we did! well I went to bed and this morning I woke up and had to go to the hospital to get a bunch of tests done.  I got there, and the dr dude came in with 11 tubes.. I was like excuse me?!?!? and he was like yeah we got a LOT of tests that your doctor wants done.  I was like I am going to passout already! and he told me that I was going to be fine and he pulled out the needle and I was getting all queezy and stuff.. they were trying to keep my mind occupied and not think about it so he was asking me about my new job at Living Treasures and stuff.. then I was like I am going...... next thing I knew my mother was holding me up and the needle was gone and mom was holding a rag on my forehead.. I heard the doctor say.. "she is the fastest person to passout I have ever seen" and my mom was like "she mad the records then" and they were all laughing and then I kinda went back out.. and then they carried me to a recliner chair and he was like, "ok just tell me when she is ready!" I was like for what? and he was like well we only got 2 tubes and we need to get the other 9 filled.. I was like what? why couldnt you have filled them up when I was out? and he told me that when you passout then they have to take the needle out.. so when I was ready then they would stick me again.. I busted into tears.. all I could think of was "I really wish Ed was here!" then mom was trying to calm me down and she was asking me if I really liked Ed and I was like yes VERY much! she told me not to fall too hard too fast, so I dont get hurt again! I dont think I will get hurt again. but we ended up leaving.. I am going to go another day to get the rest of the tests done.. I didnt feel like passing out anymore today. so we went to Kings Resturante and I got chocolate-chip pancakes and some bacon and then we came home and I laid on the couch for about 10 minutes and then I got on and now I am waiting for Ed to get on before I go to work at 3:30.. well I am going to go now.. oh wait before I go.. I wanted to tell you all that I did get the job at Living Treasures! it is soo great! I love it there, now I get a 25% discount in the gift shop and my family gets in free to the park whenever they want! I will stay prolly everynight t0o check out my little goat that was born the other day! well I am going to go! ttyl Love you Ed! ~DONNA~
