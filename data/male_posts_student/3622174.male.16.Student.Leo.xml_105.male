Today, I have two all new blogs to either praise or make fun of, but remember, its all in good fun.  But, before we get to that...   urlLink Click here!   What is that?  It's the first of several teasers for my next blog, tentatively titled Blog of Bagel 2.  Several teasers will be there in the coming weeks, and up to its launch on August 20th, 2004.  I've began to plan things for the official launch, like what the blog will be about.  It's going to be something completely different. Trust me.  And now, then, on to tonight's Late Night Bloggin'.    urlLink Random Ramblings   Rating: *  Wow.  And I thought there would never be a blog that would absolutely bore me to death.  Normally, they all have something of interest and entertainment, maybe a sex story, or how dramatic you are because your ex boyfriend or girlfriend dumped you (highly entertaining!).  I love those stories!  But, they're all mysteriously absent from this one, and it's boring.  Her most recent post talks about how she watched the Disney Channel today, and then did something for cheerleading.  Sorry, but, you've bored me to death.      urlLink Better than ur Xanga   Rating: **  Another girl's blog, another sure to be boring blog.  Yeah, that's the case, but, why higher than Random Ramblings?  Her title.  BETTER than ur Xanga is true.  Blogger truly is better than Xanga.  Having used Xanga for a long time, I definitely feel like Blogger is better.  Her posts are boring, yes, but, if it weren't for her title, I'd say this was a pretty boring blog.  But, not worthy of a "Most boring" award.  Now, as you're undoubtedly aware, I have my driving days for drivers ed on Monday and Tuesday.  I'm quite nervous.  It's going to be very, very tedious.  Alex knows exactly what I'm talking about (we were talking about it yesterday).  Here's hoping to nothing bad happening.    Then, Wednesday, its back to the doctor... I took the band-aidÂ® off of my finger today to see how it was healing, and, there's more that have to be cut off... this better not be a recurring thing.  I've got too much coming in the near future, and don't want to end up in the emergency room during yearbook camp or New York!  I already had to go to the Emergency Room once when I was in New York, and that's just not cool.  I think The Ataris are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands.  They're songs are pretty good.  Them, Midtown, and Linkin Park are in my top 5 list.  Yellowcard is good, but, I really only liked Ocean Avenue...nothing else is "that great."    Tomorrow I'm taking the day off to go visit a couple friends before my absolute busy summer finale starts.  I'll blog, probably audio from somewhere, and then a couple of other entries, if you're lucky.    So, until tomorrow, go do something constructive, like sleep, or drink something heavy.  Something I wouldn't do.
