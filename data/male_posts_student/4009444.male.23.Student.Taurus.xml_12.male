Until a noise outside makes them both  very wary  of each other, prompting a quick staring contest, followed by a lengthy and loud hiss from Brazil.  It's a  slow  process.  I get to lead the dives tomorrow off the boat at Palos Verdes since I am the resident fish expert in the class and know how to do diving fish transects.  Should be interesting.  There's one broad in the class who owns only one suit, and it's a dry suit.  Note to self:  Dry suits are a pain in the ass, and worthless unless it's below 50 in the water.  She flops around like a dying seal with that thing on - its almost embarassing.  Out of water she looks like a mix between a firefighter and a clown.  Maybe I'll cut my hair tonight, since it's the longest it's been in almost 10 years (a full 1.5-2 inches).  It's pretty rabid looking.  I even bought some spray on sunscreen for my scalp so it doesn't get cooked while I'm out there.  Nothing worse than a burnt scalp.  Judging by the fact that I've put sunscreen (SPF 30) on my face every day during this class and still gotten burned, I'm going to be hurting no matter what I spray on my skull.  Que sera, sera.  "The flow of time is always cruel.  Its speed seems different for each person, but no one can change it.  A thing that does not change with time is a memory of younger days." - yep, another quote from Zelda; they are oddly deep...
