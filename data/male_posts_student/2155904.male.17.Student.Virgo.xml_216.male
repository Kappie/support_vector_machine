But still, this is something of a finale.  The blog has pretty much been a staple of Tyke's senior year in high school.  He started it in the end of October and now he has kept it going all the way to June.  218 blogs.  218...that's just great.  Tyke is proud of himself for his dedication seeing as he hasn't been able to dedicate himself to keep anything going this long.  This is pretty remarkable for him.  Today was not all that remarkable but fun nonetheless.  Nothing went on in math today.  In weight training Tyke tried to do his bench rep test but on his 8th rep he just hit the wall and was about half a rep shy of getting it.  So he'll have to try it tomorrow.  Tyke also talked with Nene (junior girl) and finished signing each other's yearbooks.  In 3rd period since they have no final they just signed yearbooks and talked.  Tyke started up a little Clark Sharks page in his book.  Yeah, the Clark Sharks ruled the water.  Especially cuz if any other elementary school tried to come attack Clark they would have to do it underwater so they would all drown.  Haha, Tyke is now reading back over some of his blogs and he is loving it.  He just found one post from February where he was talking about Chinko.  Remember that game??  It didn't catch on like he said it would.  Oh well, you can't be right all the time, but most of the time he is.  You know what though, it's a blast to go back and read his old blogs.  He is reading some good stuff right now.  He had a nice writing style back in the day.  Maybe he still does, but he likes how his blogs used to flow.  Tina's mom just called, but not for Tyke.  Yeah, back to school though.  4th period they watched more videos.  One group's was so dirty.  It was just shocking really.  But still funny and one of the best Tyke and Dr. Phil thought.  After class Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed decided that they wanted to go to Mongolian Grill and they did.  Some other people tagged along as well.  Damn that's good.  It was very tasty.  After that the gang went back to Tyke's and they were joined by Kinker.  They played some Shithead and then started up Risk when Big Twigg came over too.  So they started a game and got very close to finishing it (after Dr. Phil raped Tyke in Asia, perhaps stopping Tyke from winning, but it's all good in war) but MormoMan and Skramfejj came over as well.  When Kinker had to leave (after taking over much of the world) MormoMan took over and finished the job.  Then they played a few more Risk games.  They did the Capitals version which is way different.  Tyke will teach you that version later.  There were some hilarious moments when everyone picked their capital right next to each other.  But all in all Risk is one hell of an awesome game.  It is just so great.  Especially the beginning of the games.  That is Tyke's favorite part.  At 5 Tyke kicked everyone out cuz his mom has been getting on his case about studying for his 1 final.  Well he still didn't study at all but oh well.  He did eat chips and Gushers for dinner so there!  Tyke is gonna wrap it up now.  It is time to move on to another chapter.  Wow, so close.
