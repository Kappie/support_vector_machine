Did get to see A Bronx Tale and Godfather III tonight though. I finally understand the deal with Godfather III - I used to think of it in terms of "The Much Maligned Godfather III" - I guess that's how people knew I hadn't seen it. Pacino, for all his ability, shot this one. Copolla's daughter, hopefully, will never find that side of a camera again. The only bright spot was Andy Garcia - recognizable in his role of "Role model for Chris Moltisanti of the Soprano's". All in all, I enjoyed the Godfather Trilogy, but really, we could have done without three. Francis, next time you get the idea to bring us up to speed on 15 years of emotion, well, bugger off.   A Bronx Tale was good - Chazz Palmintari was delightful as usual. De Niro was De Niro. The kid (both of them) did a great job. I like Chazz. I drink Vanilla Coke because of Chazz.   So over the past few hours I've fretted over a few things. Getting in shape. Learning to cook well. (I'm going to buy the Joy of Cooking tomorrow). Getting John to pay his bills (I need that money to pay the rent. Gah - Hope his 35000$ car was worth the stress he's caused me.) Getting better (being sick never helped, and being sick over Halloween blows) and being generally more productive.   I edited my resume and sent it off to a customer who asked for it. I went to visit her companies website - aside from the glaring spelling errors and horrendous web design, there is also the fact that I haven't the slightest idea of what the fuck they're trying to sell. That's never a good thing - you can find the site at www.henchcontrolinternational.com. I've got a bunch of websites I promised people I would do. To get myself in the mood, I rewrote my own page. I think I'll have it finished tomorrow - get that gob bullshit banner off there - get some of the university of waterloo nonsense off there and get a little more colour on the page. After that I think I'm going to see if I can finish, or maybe restart the 8 Wheels page, the RA page and maybe one for my dad's business. I should think about writing one for the Ice Park, or maybe even redoing the Hench page and just trying to sell them something that's complete. God knows Hench could use it. *shudder*   So now I'm cold, tired, and I have heartburn. Best thing though is my headache finally took off. Huzzah. Finished Mother of Storms tonight - John Barnes book. I've read it a dozen times, but it's still a nice pulpy easy read.   I think the children next door are already up, getting ready to stomp around their fucking house all day, screaming and crying. I think the parents beat them. If you hear of it in the news, just remember, you heard it here first - but in a system that fucks you if you're wrong on that sort of thing, I'm not going to say a god damned word.   I think I want to start writing again. Maybe in the few hours of sleep I'll manage to get myself I'll be able to find some inspiration. Either then or when I try to get my car fixed tomorrow. Alternator's going. You can tell what with the radio fucking off and it not wanting to run and such. Anyone want to by a previously loved and hated 95 Eagle summit es? Didn't think so.   Well, that's probably enough for this one. I'll see if I b-log more. Hope so. That would be a little more worthwhile, than say, not.
