But this year, at hip-hop's highest standard, up the charts, more record sales, and more white kids saying "yo". But at the top mountain, they collapsed. Hip-hop record company, Murder Inc. , changed their name to a more "kid-friendly" name. I feel bad for them. Then, right out of the sky, drops a commercial, Snoop-Dogg, Dr. Dre, and other guys rapped in the commercial. The commercial was advertising Wrffs, some weird looking bike...for kids. Which surprised me, Snoop Dogg hosted a Girls Gone Wild video and starred in his own porno film.  I'm afraid hip-hop is going to hell. Greatest wishes.
