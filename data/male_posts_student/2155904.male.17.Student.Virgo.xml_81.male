And it is really a double allusion in itself.  Well only like 10 people max know what that is from first-hand experience.  And 2 more joined that group today.  But don't get ahead of ourselves hear.  Tyke's Sunday was like a sundae, an ice cream sundae that is!!!  OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  That was wicked clever.  But it was abnormal for the fact that since tomorrow is a holiday, pause for remembrance of MLK Jr., Tyke doesn't have to be in bed early or do homework or anything.  And it is good he didn't have to be in bed early cuz it is 1:04 right now so it is reaaaaaal late.  At 3 PM PST Tyke and Macaroon met up at Costco and they purchased a nice 18" pizza for approximately 11 dollas.  They took that ish back home and began their chow fest.  Amed had joined them by this point and he ate too.  Then Kinker and Tyronius came over as well.  They all ate the pizza and began to watch the good ol' fashioned pigskin game on the telly.  It was not a real close game and really the guys didn't care cuz they decided that Medal of Honor was way more fun.  So they played that and then after hours they were called by Dr. Phil Lelee and K-caj.  They all met at Teriyaki Bistro and had food there.  Then they went into Farget and just looked around and caused havoc like usual.  Upon leaving Tyke decided to use his quarter of change from dinner and he popped that baby into the slots.  Well, at least he pushed it into the slot for where you buy one of those kid toys things.  And guess what he got...A SILVER NECKLACE!!!  It is sick.  He is wearing it now and he is not going to take it off forever.  It will always be on him for the rest of his life.  Cuz of course his neck won't grow for the rest of his life so he will still be able to wear it.  How weird would it be if it didn't grow ever again?  Like, totally weird.  He is almost exactly 6' now.  He just measured himself today and it was nice to see he was 6' about a buck 30.  Yeah, thats reaaaal skinny.  Skin skinny really.  They all went back to Tyke's and played some more MOH...then they decided to try something new after the Trew-fanator got there.  They played some games in his downstairs such as H-O-R-S-E.  Tyke had the homecourt advantage and won both games.  The two games probably lasted about an hour total.  That is a long time by the way.  But Tyke made one of the best shots ever.  Here it was...Tyke went up to Tyronius and Trew-fanator who were on the couch together as usual and then his shot was that they had to go up to them, lift up your shirt and show your right nipple and then within 3 seconds you had to score a basket.  And ya know what?  K-caj didn't do it right.  He didn't show his actual nipple, rather he just lifted up one of his two shirts.  So that was a great shot.  Tyke had other good ones too, like one of his shots was "be white and make it."  Dr. Phil missed that one.  But Dr. Phil also really struggled with the game.  He could hardly even dunk it every time it seemed.  And the hoop is about 6'3" off the ground.  If that.  To make a long story short Tyke was hot...and not just in the physical sense but the physical sense too (second physical as in temperature-wise).  Then they wound down with a game of Ratscrew in which Dr. Phil gained revenge on Tyke's domination of H-O-R-S-E and beat him in the last round.  Then they played BS.  Tyke won fair and square, then came Macaroon, then Kinker, then it was down to the Doc and K.  It was a brutal matchup as they both just kept BSing the other of course.  Then Kinker had a brilliant idea and he came in the game to speed things up.  Then he got another brilliant idea and whenever K finally put down all his cards Kink put down the next set before Dr. could BS.  It was a striking decision that proved worthy of a championship.  Then they played Shithead and remarkably Tyke was the Shithead TWO TIMES IN A ROW!!!  Unbelievable.  The heads were not with him in that game.  He made up for it with his inane carrot sexuality.  You know who you are, Tyke's one and only horse.  He'll be the carrot in front of your face for life (patent pending on this analogy...no stealing of this can be done without the expressed written consent of Tyke Turner Enterprises).  Who ever thought that a young, athletic, witty, bright, blonde, Man-boy could ever be the ire of so many individuals?  As is the life of a Tyke.  Capital T Tyke not lowercase t tyke.  That would be like, "look at those little tykes over there playing naked in the sandbox...oh wait don't look.  they're naked.  that is indecent exposure...reeeeee errrrrr. reeeeeee errrrrr goes the siren as Police Officer Nasty comes in to arrest the indecently exposed tykes."  And that's the end of that.  Clap clap.  He repeats, clap clap.  And on that note...ENGLISH PAPER=SUCK.  EDIT:  English paper still=suck but Tyke realized he forgot something else from yesterday.  Two things actually.  First off, Tyke has learned that he greatly enjoys boxer briefs.  Much more than he thought he would.  Boxers still are very good and he still hates briefs but he is a fan of boxer briefs.  They provide a little support but are not tight or restriciting and so far they have never Trent Bunched on him.  And that is greatly appreciated.  They are super comfy.  And also, speaking of boxer briefs/underwear/not wearing any, last night upon rearrival from going out to dinner Kinker came down the back way to get into Tyke's house and he said he thought he heard/saw a bunch of skinny dippers in Lake Turner.  Well, maybe he didn't actually say that but somebody told Tyke that.  So they quickly went outside his house (it was dark at this point by the way) and Tyke brought a flashlight with him.  So they all went up on Tyke's deck and looked down into the lake.  Well they didn't actually see any skinny dippers but they saw a bunch of people.  So Tyke turned on the light and shone it down on them but they saw the kids just standing there and then one of the guys goes, "hey, somebody is shining a light on me."  Yeah, that was funny.  The people were probably smoking as the crew saw a bunch of little red lights sorta emanating from the group in question.  But they were clothed unfortunately.  And luckily they did not egg Tyke's crew's cars like has happened quite frequently around his house.  Well, maybe like 5 times.  But that is in a pretty short span.  And other vandalism has occurred to Tyke's house also.  Not his actual house but stuff with his garbage and just stupid shit like that.  Kids are stupid.  Reaaaaal stupid.
