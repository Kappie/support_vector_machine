One, name Atalanta (not the city in Georgia, that is how you spell it - it was named after some greek or roman or something god) is the cool interior of a Covenant base, will all cool covenant stuff, like Ghosts and the (sadly undrivable) dropship. And the other, named frost, is (obviosly) a snow level, it is outside, and the bases are so AWESOME, ill get some pics of these sometime. Look for updated.  On a side note, somone, please "comment" on my posts, a couple of people did it, its easy. Just click the thing that says "0 (or 1) comments" and then click "add comment. I want to know how you feel.
