Lol, so yesturday I was talkin to Micheal as I was doing some dishes and then like the cordless dies, so I went into my room to call Michael back and apolgize for the phone's stupidity.  Well, the next thing I know I have a beep and it is my father for WI.  Well, I get off with Mike and talk to him for a little and I can hear water running and it dawns one me!  I left it on!  The kitchen was flooded, the drawers filled with wather, the floor, the laundry room, the counters, I mean flooded!  Totally, so I call Sam to help me clean up the water.  Shane and Sam come and help me sweep out the water, drain the drawers, and at the end I fell twice and was like soaked!  So, it is interesting, ummm yeah!
