I can smell the aroma of shrimp scampi floating through the house. Oi, I am sooooo hungry.  It is so nice and warm and cozy in the house right now.  But outside...brrrr...that's another story...ya know that mondo-snowstorm I mentioned earlier...well it hit...We got like a couple of inches in just like an hour. It is beautiful outside.  I can't wait 'til Christmas.
