Also I've got  urlLink Fire  set up now for my Yahoo! Messenger account in addition to my AIM, so I'll be on both at once now. The Yahoo! ID is the same as my AIM one, so if you use Yahoo! or both like me feel free to contact me and talk and if you're cool enough (and/or cute :D) I'll add you to my Buddy List (that goes for both Yahoo! and AIM).  Also, I've official changed my location to my new home in Shawnee, KS.
