But before I get into that I have to talk about the other bands.  The only bad part was the first two supporting bands: Downtown Brown, and s(ome name I forgot).  The lead man in downtown brown sported a mullet, and was actually a pretty funny guy (he reminded all of us of Jack Black) but the music just sucked.  This lady dressed in old fashioned Swedish clothes came up on the stage while we were waiting for the next band to go.  There was  Yamaha piano there for her.  She also had a very strong yet fake Swedish accent (She's from Montreal).  She started talking in swedish and english mixed and then she hits a button on her keyboard and some really fake sounding drum beat comes in.  That's when I realize this is the next band.  And I actually have some clips of her:    urlLink
