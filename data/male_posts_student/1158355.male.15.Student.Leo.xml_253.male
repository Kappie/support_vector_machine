So please make plans with me, I'm too lazy to make plans with you. Anyways, yesterday I drummed all day and my drum teacher gave me Interstate Love Song from STP and he showed me the beginning of Dyer Maker and a hard bass drum part to Good Times Bad Times. Also showed me some Latin Cha-Cha. At night I had a sleep over with Heaton and were supposed to with Paul but we found out he went to some basketball camp in Pennsylvania. WTF? Everyone's away, everyone's dead. Or maybe I'm just too lazy to call the people that are home and alive. Today nothing is happening. I'm just existing in my room. Tonight I'm gonna work for Tiara's uncle moving rocks on her lawn and I'm getting payed! w00t. Oh, Tool fans, check this out.  "Adam, Justin and Danny have been keeping to their rigorous schedule, writing and arranging material for the next Tool CD, this despite the Lakers being in the NBA play-offs, a fact of life which occupies a couple of the band members' nights (rehearsal/writing sessions go from noon 'till six). In a couple of weeks, when he's finished touring with APC, Maynard will join in on the ghastly fun (although he's already been quite involved), and hopefully, another web-cast can be arranged once more of the new songs begin to take shape. In the meantime, while talking to Danny the other night as the new Skinny Puppy release exploded from his living room speakers, he began to describe for me the complex time signatures of one of the new Tool songs, adding, after another sip of a Saint Pauli Girl (the German beer), that it was probably the best piece of music he'd ever been involved with. And this after only a half of a bier."
