I was very excited, then I got to thinking about how I'm always waiting for bands I like to "break the mainstream."  I guess the bands I like (with exceptions of U2 and Coldplay) are always alternative or Christian or foreign and out of the mainstream for one of those reasons.  I got really excited when Switchfoot's Meant To Live got so much mainstream airplay.  And Dare You To Move is movin' up.  I wish Delirious was on the radio though.  Maybe someday.
