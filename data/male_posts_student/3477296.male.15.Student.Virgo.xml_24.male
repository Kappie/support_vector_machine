Firstly, while we sat in our class, pretending to learn, a head teacher came along n said we were going to get kicked out by little yr 1s. And wen we moved into da hallways, where a makeshift table was used...Den i got pissed. It was fuckn cold n dim, making it a great classroom :) Afta 30 mins of pain, we eventually got to move....to a room where there was only 3 ppl. (Rove: DUUUUUHHHHHH!!!!) It took dem a goddam half n hour to find a room....where dere was only 3 ppl...Dats wen i really got pissed.   But dat was da end of da shit I had to take. During break, we dogged da teacher, went to CFN, played CS, with my team getting canned cos none of dem could get at least a 1:1 ratio (of course i could :P) n went bak with 20 mins of class to go.   Da teacher didnt even care....which was da sweet part. Den agen, were pretty "trustworthy". HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  Did neone see Zlatan Imbrahimozvic's goal agenst Italy??? ABSOLUTE PURE MAGIC b CHEEKINESS TO DA MAX...  GO DA EAGLES...KILL DA BUNNIES 2day.
