I enjoy going to work during the week. Now I have to do my homework but I have to try to get myself in the mood. I just want to lay here and sleep. I am watching Il Padrino II (thats The Godfather II for you non-Italiano's) :-)  I love the Godfather! That and Goodfellas are 2 great movies.     urlLink Pics Of My Still Messed Up Face!!!!
