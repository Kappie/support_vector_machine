But seriously, there are tons of emotions inside, instead of logical, coherent thoughts. No poems now, cos' my friend told me that there are too many poems in this blog......!! but, its not that i let others dictate what goes in this blog really, cos' there's no inspiration to write one..........  But yeah, hari raya haji today, hmmmmm, very rainy outside, i'm listening to opeth now, after 4 days of listening to Eason Chan, i decided to revert to my old "diet". But i'll probably be listening to him again pretty soon................My posts would be pretty short for the next few days, cos' there's only one thing which dictate whether i get to write stuff, or play guitar/piano.............its only one thing........that's INSPIRATION !!! So currently, my inspiration tank is dry.   Ok fine, i think i got a bit of inspiration now to write about..................ummm, inspiration........  Alright, to me, insipiration is something which is in the air, its not inside you, its like the wind, sometimes it comes, sometimes it goes, and sometimes it can be found more in certain places, sometimes less. Inspiration is a spiritual experience, inspiration causes the best paintings, the best musical pieces, the best poems, the best writings. Inspiration transport you from your mundane everyday existance, to a place filled with surrealistic images, where stark emotions hit you, stark.............It can be darkness, melancholy, happiness, love................Inspiration is when a painter does not feel his fingertips on the paintbrush, is when a pianist doesn't feel his fingers on the ivory, when a writer doesn't feel his fingers on the pen.   It is when your body responds like clockwork to your heart, bypassing the technical aspects of your craft, like, should i add a string bend, to this guitar solo?, should this particular linear scale, be done in legato, should I use the C melodic minor and add a flatted 5th? should i add blue, or red to this painting? All this questions would be non-existant in the presence of inspiration. Because, normal mundane practicing of your craft is what your brain tells your body to do. But inspiration, is what your heart tells your body to do.  Artists today do not have that privellage, you would never have inspiration if you work withing a time frame. "I want that piece composed by the end of this week." "The client wants that painting by thursday !!" Is inspiration dying out? Does the winds of inspiration blows at us, and we still cannot feel its presence? To me, also, inspiration is when you are "out-of-body". When you don't feel anything in your flesh and blood, and sometimes, alcohol helps.   But ok, i'll come to the topic on alcohol and all here. Firstly, don't get addicted. But inspiration usually comes when you're toeing the line between soberness and drunkedness, so, drugs do not help imo, unless you're a professional drug-user such as Hendrix, and use depresseant drugs instead of stimulants, but that's my opinion after all, so don't take it at face value....................lol.........
