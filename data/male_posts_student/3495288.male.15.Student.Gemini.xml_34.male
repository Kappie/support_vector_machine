While i was in the band room i had to push the HEAVY PIANO, carry the unwanted stuffs and carry all the percussion instruments out first before i could ask the band to set up the chairs in the formation i wanted. One by one the members arrive, some excited and some simply sleepy. I ordered everyone around, i too did work along with them ok. When everyone had settled down, the majors (including me) went through the pieces that are supposed to be played to day. The first song was Somerset March (conducted by Mei Hui), Cha cha for band (conducted by Shazwani), Latin Gold (conducted by Mei Hui again), Big Fun in the sun (Shazwani again) then its Best Friend/Kiroro (conducted by Grace) and Arioso (conducted by me). Once done, the HR (human resource) and i went to decorate the music room while everyone went for an hour of lunch at around 11:30am till 12:30pm. Some parents had already arrive early but they waited out side the band room. I had to shout alot today as most did not listen. When everything was ready, the members settled down and the parents came in. Most were happy as their parents/boy-or-girlfriend/friends are there to support them, as for me...haiz... for the past 3years... non had supported me...neither my parents nor bestfriends did. Well we played the song as pernormal, then boring speeches, then the giving of certificates. When the majors were announced, i was first of course, many went cat calling us all while we get our certs. After the investiture, i had to ask a few members to stay in the music room to clean up with me while the rest of them went to eat. Once that was done i went out to eat, with an empty stomach, i went searching for food but luckily got a big left. At last i had a boost of Carbohydrates. We had fun talking and all. Then my band friends, including my instructor, decided to go to Dhoby Ghaut to have a walk and have fun. I followed them as they asked me to come along. During the journey i fell asleep as i was SUPERBLY TIRED after all that pushing the heavy piano alone, carrying tables and chairs, scream and shout, run here and there and invite the parents. Haiz. We went to a music store and found alot of percussion accessories there, then we went to THE SECRET GARDEN (a cafe, bistro and bar). My instructor had a beer and i had non hahah. After that my instructor called his friend for a tickets to this concert at the Esplanade by Nanyang Technology Symphonic Band with guest band by Philharmonic Winds. The original price of the tickets are between $22-$55 and we had the tickets for just $4. Cheap eh?.. haha. The band was superb!... I love them man! They played Miss Saigon, Trumpet Concerto in Eb Major-Finale, Highlights from Chess, Symphony No.5 Finale, A Reminiscence of Musicals, Fiddler on the Roof, The Wizards of Oz (got tuba solo! SO GOOD!), Les Miserables and Singapore Cancer Society Theme Song. They had a special guest singers, Amy Cheng and Darren Seah. Everything was superb! Its a fund raising concert for your information. Well i went back home with them, reached here at home at 1am. Wow! been away from home for more 18hours! so tired man! had to walk around in my Band Uniform and Marching Shoes, which is really aching if walk in it at a very long distance or a long time. Many were staring at me in the concert all, i just spoke to my self, "There is no Dress Code mah going to this concert.".. hahah. --------------------------------------------------  Reply to Daniel- Well Daniel, sometimes i can get lil pissed off at times. You are lucky that its just stage one of my 'Pissiness'. I will get really pissed of if i am  SUPERBLY BORED, IRRITATED and ANGRY . And hope you don't do that lor cause something bad might really happen lor.  Thats ok lah...Haiz... NO ONE is there for me one... but i am ALWAYS there for everyone... No one supports me but i support them... haiz... Sick and tired of that... just wish someone can be there for me most of the time...as i always be there for him most of the time ... haiz... FUCK LAH!... hehehe... lil bit pissed off now. :P
