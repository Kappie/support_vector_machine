I have had problems with girls ever since Sarah said inderectly I was her boyfriend in the second grade. She was my friend since about first, and I had her over to my house one day. The next day at school, when we were discussing the word chandeleir (shows you how much I have learned, I don't even know how to spell it). She stated "My boyfriend has one of those in his bathroom.", and being the naive young man that I was, I thought, "Gee. I have one in my bathroom too." Thus my interduction to the world of women. But the big juicy problems started about a year ago. See, I started liking this one girl in school, well, not just one girl, because I can say I like many girls in school. But this one especially has turned into one that is important. I will say her name is Andrea, because her name IS Andrea. Anyway, I started liking her. I was looking forward to hanging out with her at this vacation bible school I help out with ever year. I was looking forward to hanging out with her, until I met Andilynne. Ah, yes, Andilynne. Blonde, very pretty, everything a man could ask for and more, yes? Oh yeah, and she even had a good personality. Unfortunatly, although I didn't know it yet, she was shallow even to the point of me noticing. I still don't have a clue wheather she fakes it or not, but she definatly acts shallow. Anyway, I spent the dog days of summer flirting with her. Of course she lives far away, so in all reality, I spent the dog days of summer wishing I was flirting with her. By the time fall came around, I saw her for one last time, got her phone number, went to her youth group...oh wait. Whadda ya know? Andrea is in her youth group, too. Strange. Anyways, as time progresses, Andi becomes more distant from me. It comes to a point where I realize she does not like me anymore. How sad. I confide in Andrea. Bad move, because I end up falling for her. As we both admit that we like each other, I think it is only natural that we progress into a romantic relationship, right? Oh yeah. She has a boyfriend. Oops. Well, maybe I can get around that, right? To make a long story short, no, I can't. And now I have to hold Andrea in the highest regard because she did not cheat on her boyfriend. So, my birthday comes around after we realize that our relationship will definatly be nothing more than just friends. And Andilynne calls me. Calls me THREE times on my birthday, if fact (I wasn't home). When she finally does reach me, she "confesses" to me that she still likes me. Augh. Not that I don't like it when a girl tells me she likes me, but I really doubt she actually likes me. I guess you would have to know the girl to actually understand. So, I try to break that off as best as I can. (As it turns out, I am still struggling to convince her that I really don't want to go out with her). So, it's back to bachelor. As you can see, I have had a romantic roller coaster, and just coming out of it, I really don't feel like entering another relationship like that in a while. Maybe I was a bit of a fanatic when saying that I am not going out for a really long time like five years. I can't forsee the future, but all I am saying is it will have to be someone really really really special for me to go out with her.   Someone like J-Lo.  Maybe not even her.
