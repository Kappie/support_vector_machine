Today should liven me up a bit with my driving test (stay off the roads around 2pm) followed by David Giles' album release party which I am meant to be doing backing vocals for, hopefully accompanied by Emma's backing triangle (or whatever she can get hold of). Im really thinking that tomorrows test will simply be a waste of another about 35 pounds- some divine intervention will most probably be required if I'm going to pass. I suppose "Things Can Only Get Better" compared to last time but if I believe that then that would need me to have confidence in not getting stopped half way through for dangerous driving.  Normally its times like this with nothing going on when I find something trivial to get excited about but I'm having trouble even doing that. Just had to occupy myself with watching I Spy With My Little Phi on VHS but that just compounded my boredom even more- the characters are just too unrealistic, especially Eddie Holkenwaenk who the producers seemed to make progressively out of touch with the real world as the series progressed.
