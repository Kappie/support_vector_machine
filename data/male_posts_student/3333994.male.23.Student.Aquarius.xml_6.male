My future as a consultant will depend on how well I can grasp the current technology as well as foresee new areas still to come.  I am a firm believer in using technology as an aid.  Advancements in the area of electronic medical records and the use of the internet to proscribe healthcare have ushered us into a new era of medicine.  This is a dangerous time as facilities scramble to compete with each other for having the newest and fastest technology possible.  Unfortunately, rules and regulations concerning new technologies cannot keep up with the pace of discovery.  This leaves voids that can potentially lead to breaches of confidentiality.  Electronic medical records promise a paperless and fully transferable form of medical record.  No more waiting to be faxed information from another facility or having to look for the record in an endless library of patients.  A few keystrokes and any pertinent information will be at the user's fingertips.  This has the potential to save lives and make healthcare more efficient.  However, protecting the records from unauthorized use has yet to be mastered.  In the case of using the internet to facilitate medical care, the same benefits are possible but the same concerns for security are present.  As technology continues to expand and new ways of storing, transferring, and retrieving patient information are invented, it is extremely important that healthcare entities think about their patients' rights rather than only focusing on the monetary benefits.  Any thoughts?
