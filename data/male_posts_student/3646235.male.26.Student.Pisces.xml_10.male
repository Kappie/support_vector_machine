I don't think people strive to learn during their life like they should.  You should always strive to learn.  People walk around listening to music over their walkmans.  Does no one think anymore?  I use the time walking to plan my day, analyze data, etc.  Oh well.  Anyways, the word of the day words will most likely be familar, but you know when you use a word but don't really know the definition, that's what I'm going to post.  Today's word is audacity.  It means boldness; impertinence.  As in "I can't believe this guy is post the word of the day when his vocabulary sucks!"  I was supposed to talk about the wedding today, but I'm rushed for time.  I finished two more experiments today and entered them into the database, so I'm running ahead of schedule in the grand scheme of things, but late today, go figure.  More tomorrow (and another word!).
