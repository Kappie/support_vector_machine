So I start downloading this video, and five minutes into the download, I get this message...   Internet Explorer cannot download thebottomline1.wmv from ...llyoucaneatentertainment.com.  A system call that should never fail has failed.   Wow... I guess no one can get Windows to work right... and what's worse? Check this experience out...     Linux anyone?
