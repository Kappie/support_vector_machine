I'm amazed at how many comments I've had already, considerin this blog's less than 24 hours old... and not to mention e-mails :-) Oh well... makes me feel wanted i guess :D Apologies about Lou, I guess you caught her in one of her "funny" moods ;-) best not say too much stuff along those lines, or she'll come round and beat me up! Nah not really, but she's a touch nuts occasionally... Why have i let her onto my blog? Oh I dunno, thought you could do with a little excitement ;-)  Tell me if she does anything tooo outrageous... please? I've got to be off, mum wants me to look upo some flight times for her... LoZ
