Alyssa kept yelling at me so I started writing again.  I went to West Virginia to see the family. Ya know how it goes, it was fun though. Let's see, on the way there my mom heads into Parkersburg to eat, when she leaves she head west to go east, I finally convince her, and she turns around. Okay, so now we're heading east, and she see's the 7th street exit sign, where we just got off at to go eat, she gets off. She turns around, I convince her she's going the wrong way, rise, lather and repeat, about 3 times.  I found a lighter while in WV, I went up Seneca Rocks, a big mountain, on the way back down some guy left his cigarettes and lighter, I just stole the lighter! I used the lighter to light fireworks, which I burnt myself with... That hurt.  On the way out, my mom leaves going 33 West (the right way), I fall asleep and next thing I know we are going up 250 north (the wrong way). We take 250 N for about a half and hour and we get on 119 North, we follow that for about 20 minutes until we end up in Grafton, home of Coach Newcome. Finally we find 50 West (the right way) and head back home. All the while, I'm in the back seat with 2 eight-year-old girls... What a nightmare!  I'm probably missing something in here, oh well, now we move onto Tim's Birthday party. It was good fun, after I stopped getting yelled at. I always love being around people.  That was yesterday, today I went over again. Good times all around. I got to go shopping and tell Alyssa how ugly everything she picked out was. She did end up picking cool shoes though, that's always good.  More later, if you want it sooner, than, oh well. Sue me. Oh, And I'll give it to you orally in a minute.
