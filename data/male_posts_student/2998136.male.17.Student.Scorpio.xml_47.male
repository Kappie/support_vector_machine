And since it's Friday night, you are all for the idea of sipping alcohol in a snazzy bar with good audio vibrations that'll put you in a relazing mood for a nice chit-chat.  But before you get  too  relaxed, especially if it is your first time hanging out with your date, there are some things you may want to take note of:  If you cannot hold your liquor well, avoid drinking too much. Doesn't matter if the guy is paying for all drinks - one shouldn't be too greedy especially if alcohol doesn't go well with you. Avoid taking shots (such as tequila pops) because you are required to "pop" the drink down in one gulp, so chances are you'll get tipsy faster. Moral of the story is - don't let the free drinks get to your head.  If you are wearing a cute miniskirt, don't, for the love of all mankind, agree to go to a pub where they  only  have high barstools. Even if you are very sure you will not let anything slip into view, you can never be sure what will happen after a few cocktails. And even if you think you can trust your date, you haven't seen how he behaves after a few jugs of beer.  If you go to the ladies' to powder your nose and check for vegetable bits between your teeth, never take another sip of your drink when you come back. Never mind if you date looks like the harmless, innocent sort. Looks can deceive. Date rape drugs are so rampant now you can never be too careful. Some of these drugs can even make their victims permanently sterile. So always be more cautious than careless. Smile sweetly and ask your date nicely to order another Cosmopolitan for you, tell him you like it chilled, not lukewarm.  Finally, if your date turns a tad unruly after drinking and tries to cosy up to you in a tube way, be your own woman: just stand up and leave. Don't let him send you home. If he's driving, he shouldn't even be drinking in the first place. So always have sufficient cash with you, even on dates. You never know when you'll need to make a quick exit.
