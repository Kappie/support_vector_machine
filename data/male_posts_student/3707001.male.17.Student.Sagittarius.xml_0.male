Thursday when i was supposed to play ball wit those ppl, half of them never showed -_- ... like come on, its not hard to come to ball, and if something came up u should at least have the decency to call or AT LEAST explain over msn... but no, i was let down.  Later on thursday i went to work :(.  The big boss didnt close - that was a plus.  But both of the ppl in my department suddenly felt sick at the same time and left... leaving me alone to face the whole store by myself.  For those of u who dont work in groceries, facing (also referred to flatenning) means that i walk through every aisle and fix all the products so that the aisle looks like a solid wall.  After that u gotta fix the front and back displays.  With a friend and at a leisurely pace, it takes about 40 mins during on a weeknight.  I did most of it in 45, then had to face the diary department.  Man, 1 hr of absolute boredom... not cool  Yesterday, I woke up early (as usual) and turned on the comp.  I never realised how fast time flies when ur playing sc (comp game)... During one of the games, i checked the time, it said 11ish in the morn.  So i played a game or 2 more, and i check the time after what seemed like a second later and it was 2!!!  I knew that i was supposed to get ready and stuff at about 5 to go to my grandma's, but i decided that instead of taking my shower i was gonna play some FFX (my 2nd fav game ever!!!).  After about half an hour of leading Tidus through the Isle of Besaid, i feel asleep :S.  When i woke up my mom was yelling at me to make sure i was ready to leave... this was at 5:30.  So i ran in the shower, did my stuff, got dressed, grabbed the essentials (wallet, cell, MD, gum, forgot my keys >. Anyways, we finally got there at about 9.  Upon arrival, i went inside and started talking to my grandma who i hadnt seen in a year or so.  She was all proud of me going to UofT next year, and she started talking to me about life in the Phillipines (shes going there soon).  From what i remember, she supports a single parent family who lives on a hill, whom she will be visiting in the summer.  Unfortunatley, she can only bring 72 lbs of stuff and shes afraid she may be over the limit.  For each pound of stuff over u have to pay $20+!!!  Then she asked us if we ate dinner yet, we said no.  So she sent my oldest bro to get my mom to tell her that shes taking us to fish ^.^  My grandparents are regulars there so my grandma called them to make sure that there still open.  While they were doing this, my eyes fell upon a white book wit those familiar words "Holy Bible" on it.  When i saw this i remembered that i lost my last one, so i asked if she had any extras.  She said that she got that white one for free at a garage sale and that i could have it -.-  After waiting in the basement and looking at my uncles living room for a while, we finally made our way to the fish spot.  When i walked in, the first thing my eyes so was a kinda cute chinese girl.  My first thought was, "huh? fish  chips by asians?" and my second thought was, "that girls kinda cute..."  After a few hellos, my grandma introduced me (with pride) as the grandson whos going to UofT next year.  Then she told me that that cute asian girl was going to gr. 9 next year!!! >. Anyways, the food was good and then we went to our separate homes, and i forgot the Bible in the van :( i think its still there... at least i hope... :o  Today... boring again.  Woke up at 8 to hear my alarm play my fav BoyzIIMen cd, went to sleep for another 30 mins b4 jumping in the shower.  Did my thing, got out of the bathroom, saw it I had 2 mins to get to work, gave up on being on time, took my sweet time getting dressed, dreading another 7.5 hrs of work to come.  I left home, and got to work 15 mins late, (its only a 3 min work to work :D!!).  When i got there i saw that it was gonna be a little more fun than usual as one of the managers was on vacation and his spot was taken up by one of the younger cooler ppl.  I'll avoid boring u ppl (as if this blog isnt boring enough :P ) so I'll just say that i barely survived work without going crazy and hurting myself.  When i got home, i turned on the comp, got changed, and found out that my parents were making a return trip to granny's today.  I told them that i was too tired to go (what?! its the truth!!) so my mom had to leave me and my bro some of the lasagna that she made ^.^ When they left, i ate it, played some sc, and decide to write in my blog... and here I am...  Sadly, i will not be at church tmr as my parents stop driving me there when sunday school ends... so i wont be at church sunday morn for a long time, prolly 2 months when sunday school starts again.  I also hope to attend some weds nites at church, even tho the usual is not going down, its about time i helped out some1 other than myself!! I also gotta give Matt my FF7  8, great games they are (FF7 being by #1 of ALL TIME!!!!)  Anyways, i ran outta stuff to write... ...........................................
