I got far more then I bargained for, and wrote it all down in my offline journal before I could forget.  Needless to say it was a rather interesting experience having something that takes shape in your mind "speak for itself".  I probubly sound insane, but it needs to be experienced before one can actually understand.  School, boring.  SOMS School in Action night?  Fun.  I saw how four of Mrs. Winklers kids did Malcolm X in the same style as I did originally!  Yay! I'm an inspiration.  Then I talked to Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Wiggins, that was equally fun.  In general it made my day fun.  I started up again with Arabic, everyone says Esperanto is pretty useless, so I'll stop being idealogical and be practical.  Although I still have two more chapters until I can read a part of "Sinbad the Sailor" in Arabic.  That's like one of the best characters in "1001 Arabian Nights", anyone who hasn't read that book should.  It's the best non-religious Arabic book (I'm not familiar with comtemporary Arabic writting) that one can hope to find.
