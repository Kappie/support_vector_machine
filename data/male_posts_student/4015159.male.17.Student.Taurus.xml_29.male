I've done it once or twice but tomorrow will be the only time that counts... Here it is.          The Seventh Task          Tomorrow my task will to be the top at bowling. I must win everyone else there. I usually come 2nd/3rd but have only ever come 1st a few times (And that was only an arcade bowling alley). HOPEFULLY I'm taking my camera (if i remember) so I may post some piccies on here, should be a good night. WISH ME LUCK :D
