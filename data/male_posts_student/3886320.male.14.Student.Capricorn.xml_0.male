Anywayz apart from that Im a punker/grunger WHATEVER, i breath, eat, sleep punks (i eat blink 182 cds) and me and carlos are pretty much the only punks in our school since everyone likes hiphop but F**K them. IM so hyper and u wouldnt wont to spend a week with me :) carlos is just crazy and/or unique :P PLEASE comment if ur a punk i wanna communicate with u guys
