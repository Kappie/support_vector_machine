For some reason though, it's getting to be a bit annoying. In the morning Tyke was awakened multiple times by his grandma getting up as well as her dog barking, whining, breathing, and licking. Tyke didn't even get that great of a sleep last night on the couch. Usually he does cuz it's a really nice couch but he tossed and turned for quite a while. After getting up he looked at the clock and somehow it was already 1 PM. So he got some joking words from all the family which was a little annoying but hey, he did sleep later than everyone else. He got some more presents in the morning which was cool and then he watered a bunch of plants. It was hot out again but Tyke still liked it. Some of the family was gone at Ikea but Tyke and the younger cousin played some PS2 and remarkably Tyke got his ass kicked. He had no idea he was getting played by the little bastard. Then they decided to go to Blockbuster so Tyke drove them over there and they got a couple games. Back at home they didn't really do anything but Tyke got annoyed once again. It is pretty annoying that his grandmother is one of the most stubborn and closed-minded people Tyke knows. She just kept on bashing the music Tyke listens to and she doesn't even have an idea what he listens to. So he said that he listens to some classical, which is true, and then she said the songs he likes aren't really that good anyway. It's like, come on, just cuz Tyke doesn't listen to every single song and band you like, it doesn't mean he has terrible taste in music. So Tyke then just wouldn't tell her any of the other types of music he listens to because she was just going to bash that too. Tyke then decided he would go back to playing video games. All of the family but the 3 "kids" went to a Diana Krall concert at night so Tyke was left to watch the cousins and the dog. Once again, Tyke's grandma made some comments that alluded to Tyke's irresponsibility or at least the irresponsibility of every single teenager alive. Yet again Tyke tried to ignore that. She seems to have been a little bit more pessimistic this visit. Not sure why. Right now her dog is eating his left paw and his fur along with licking the carpet. And it's a little annoying. So Tyke is staring it down now. Yep, Tyke just won that staring contest. When everyone was gone Tyke and the cuzzes played PS2 and then took the dog on a walk. That was pleasant. Then they went and picked up a pizza and brought it back home and ate it. It tasted really good. Then they played some PS2 and then watched National Lampoon's Vacation until everybody got back. The problem with his cousins is that they never make up their mind. They say "I don't care" or "I don't know" to everything. And Tyke is supposed to be some super adult around them too so he can't play poker with them or anything like that. He probably shouldn't have even shown the movie he showed cuz it has nudity and swearing. Tyke is just glad he doesn't live that way. Tyke's parents are totally wickedly cool compared to the rest of his family. But Tyke just has to go to bed tonight, wake up tomorrow and then they will be gone shortly thereafter. It just isn't like it used to be. It used to be a lot of fun but now it's just a hassle. Oh well, Tyke's growing up to the point where there won't be very many get togethers anymore.
