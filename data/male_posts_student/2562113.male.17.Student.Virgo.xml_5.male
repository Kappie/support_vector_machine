Work was cake today, we refinished one small gym in Putnam County and were home by noon. The head custodian there was mad cool and entertained us with Desert Shield war stories while we worked. Brian and I shared some infamous college stories. He graduated from SUNY Oswego last year and assures me that college is going to be the best four years ever. My one semester in Albany has already been great, I can't wait to go back up for spring semester - this lame winter break needs to hurry the fuck up and end!!!  After work I dropped my fuel-leaking ghetto wagon off at the shop. Looks like it's going to be a few days until it gets fixed. Now my parents are offering to pay half of whatever it's going to cost to get it repaired. Seems fair to me, since they used the car for over a decade before I ever got to drive it. However it's still going to be a huge burden on my savings. I hope Tom has more work for me next week. $$$...woot woot!!!  Chris picked me up tonight along with Nick and Adam. Highlights include going to McDonald's and going around the drive-thru four times -- one time for each person because we were too lazy to pay all at once! The third or fourth time around the drive-thru the cashier looked puzzled, and Big C hooked us up with MAD food. For some odd reason he gave us about 15 honey mustard packets, most of which I threw at road signs on the way home. We also yelled at a deer walking in the middle of Central Highway. Deer are very stupid animals -- too bad I didn't have any honey mustard packets left to throw at it. :::evil grin:::  New Year's Eve is shaping up to be a blast!!! I don't plan on drinking myself until I black out like I did last year, but I'm going to drink enough so that my liver will be cursing me the next morning. My college-burdened liver got a break for a while but naptime is over, bitch!  -BIGsmut.
