Alone and forced into early retirement, you live off of your police force pension, imposing your presence on those too sick to escape you.    urlLink   Which Princess Bride character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    haha thats me rightdown to the type of hats the grandfather wears, sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era now this proves it lol
