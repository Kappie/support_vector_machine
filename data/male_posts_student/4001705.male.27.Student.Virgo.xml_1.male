What's up with all of this "The Lord told me to win or something bad's gonna happen" crap?  Who the hell does he think he is?  Moses incarnate?  I thought that the time of miracles has passed.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it.  I think President Bush's latest idiotic statements are a lame attempt to gather votes from the White Anglo-Saxson Prodestants(W.A.S.P.s) who back his whole "ban gay marrage" Constitutional Amendment.  Anyway, I'm through ranting about this for now.  I have some "Real" issues of my own to take care of.  Have a "nice" day and remember, if you don't bitch about something, your letting the bastards get away with it. Kamron
