Now, I will blog about what it would be like if I was going to perform in front of an audience and what I would do....   Entry Number One  If I was going to perform in front of an audience,  I would pee my pants, or worse. In fact, I think I would even vomit on all of the people that are sitting in the front row. Hey! If they want to be that close, then they are going to get what they paid for.  If I was going to perform in front of an audience, I would take the advice of many people who say, "Imagine everyone in their underwear." Then I would scream, run, and reach for my Prozac/Ritalin/other anti-anxiety when my brain takes my imagination and runs wild with it. I would then curse whoever said to imagine people in their underwear and get a bounty hunter to just... strike that person down! Ok, maybe I wouldn't curse them, I'd just...... make up some really bad gossip! Ha ha ha.  If I was going to perform, I think I would pass out right then and there. Why bother with trying to perform when you can pretend that you are not concious!  If I was going to peform in front of an audience, I would run 1000+ miles to either Canada or the middle of nowhere.... aka New Mexico....
