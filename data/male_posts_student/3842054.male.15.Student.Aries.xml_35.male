Im making this an early post because im going to be early tonight.  Right now, i would like to review my summer, just in time for the new year:  - Got my learners permit. Now im practicing driving all over southern Palm Beach. Just one more year till ill be let loose. - Went to Chicago, Illinois to visit my best friend Dan. Stayed there for one week with Katie in Daniels house. We did a lot including going to the City, going to Six Flags, and even going to the dollar store.      Maroon 5 - Sweetest Goodbye  - Hung out with Brittney a total of 5 times. Thats a lot more than i thought. - Daniel returns back to Florida and stays at my house for a week. We go to the beach, Cityplace, meet Brittney, and get to see Alex Olivera for the first time in about a year. - I start my blog. July 4th 2004, a very eventful day. I burn my thumb on a sparkler, start this thing, and wake up the next morning finding out i wont be surfing for the first time ever. - Summer reading. First time I ever had to do this. I successfully read one of my favoritve books ever (The Good Earth) and the worst book i have ever read (Guns, Germs, and Steel.) -See Spiderman 2 three times. Best movie ive ever seen, cant wait for the third installment. - Start listening to a broader range of music, including Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Story of the Year, Sugarcult, and Switchfoot. - The end of July, Ryan, Alex, Kelsey, Brittney, Katie Sadow, and I all meet up at Alex's house for a party type thing. We had a great time while seeing Spiderman 2, playing cranium, making bar-b-q (oh god...) losing my voice, and spending the night in Jupiter. - The best time ever. WARPED TOUR. We spend a total of 8 hours there seeing a variety of bands including Yellowcard, Sugarcult, Story of the Year, Coheed and Cambria, New Found Glory, and NOFX. - Time on the phone. I spent so much time on the phone this summer, it was unhealthy. But i would like to thank Brittney, Daniel, and Becca... including special guests like Katie Ross, Erin Porter, and Emily (Brittneys friend)  for making every night after 9 a blast.  Well, thats the main events of my summer in a nutshell. It was fun while it lasted, but I can not wait to start another year at the school of the Arts, making Films, speeches, and getting more stressed out then i ever have before. Well, have a good school year everyone!  Black Eyed Peas Lets Get it Started  Let's get it started in here.......
