The report notes that numerous networking features are removed, and the Starter Edition allows only three applications to be run concurrently. According to Microsoft, this limitation 'helps [users] stay organized and reduces confusion.'"    Wow....three programs at a time, and Microsoft expects it will reach out to its users how? Just another show of how Microsoft shows an almost comical disregard for its users, just like its complete ignorance of IE, which has now become a joke ( urlLink Firefox,  people!!)...Oy!!
