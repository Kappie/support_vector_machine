Coffee's hot It spills, it burns Lid pops off On sharp right turns  Food is cheap But it's no good Only choice In the neighborhood  And no real choice You've got no legislative voice So on these facts Compensate you For the tortfeasor's acts  Nutrasweet In quantity Tumors grow In you and me  Pesticides Genetic change Three-armed apples Meat tastes strange  And no real choice You've got no legislative voice So on these facts Compensate you For the tortfeasor's acts  Profit mo-ti-va-ted But without a social conscience? You should pay Burned or o-ver-weight-ed Is a cause of action When a corporation Doesn't act in a friendly way  And no real choice You've got no legislative voice So on these facts Compensate you For the tortfeasor's acts
