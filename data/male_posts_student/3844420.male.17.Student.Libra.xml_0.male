I've been sick recently, dealing with throat infection, fever and a bout of cough. I'm fine now. School's getting busier now, now trying to get along with the class. Some bastards are so damn noisy, can't stand them. They suck. The rest of the class is pretty fine though. I really miss the holiday time. Argh.. Hoping holidays faster arrive. When that time comes, it'll bring along fun and joy. LoL
