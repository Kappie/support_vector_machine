I mean it was REALLY good one out little "tour" with my grandma thats visiting, until of course my mom totaly went insane for no reason but ONLY something she brough on herself. She really isn't leaving a good impression.    Maybe I can settle this on my own but then again it might take a while the longest we've been very mad is 2 weeks then everything was settled to normal but it took about 6 months to "repair" HOWEVER this isnt even HALF as bad.   But in GOOD news, I'm going to see Richards new house in Qualicum Beach today HA took them long enough. Oh well.
