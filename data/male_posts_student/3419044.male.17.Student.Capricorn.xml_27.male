    
       I apologize.  I have been and will be busy this week.  I will not have time for any lengthy posts until the weekend I predict.  Now that it's in the last 3 weeks of regular school classes, things are coming down 'to the wire'.  Missing this Friday and Monday doesn't help the situation but I can do it!  Talk to you soon...
