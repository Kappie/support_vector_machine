Well...at least one week's down..only 42 more to go....anyway, I've got nothing to say, but I thought I might make this worth it and post something I'll make up as I go along..hope it makes sense...   Top 10 Signs You Might be In Trouble     10. You eat a hot dog from a 7-Eleven 9. You eat anything from a 7-Eleven 8. You find that most of one of your fingers has gone missing, and you just finished slicing some meat for that sandwich you've already eaten. 7. You wake up next to someone you're sure you had sex with, but wish you hadn't. Fortunately, they are of the opposite sex...unfortunately, they are not of the same species. 6. You find an angry mob of hooded individuals, wearing white, and weilding torches with a burning cross behind them, at your doorstep. 5. Your grandfather killed himself because you are ugly. 4. Your grandmother killed herself because you are ugly. 3. You vomit uncontrollably all over your date...for five full minutes. 2. Your genitals glow after a school trip to the nuclear plant. 1. Your ass pees    ok and now for another song you must download b/c it kicks that much ass...well...mebbe not musically..but the lyrics do rock.    Black Sabbath - Paranoid  Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  Can you help me occupy my brain? Oh yeah  I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry Happiness I cannot feel, and love to me is so unreal  And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late...
