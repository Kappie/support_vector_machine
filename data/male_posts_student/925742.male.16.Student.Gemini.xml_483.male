Sheeeeeeeeeee's a magical girl. *guitar vader, good song for being annoying*  Wow, typing in german is serhr...... easy.    Iunno,  I worked yesterday and stuff.  Talked to Ashley for about 80 minutes on the phone, I hope I'm not going over.  Tonight I'm planning on going out with the family to Ameristar/Harvey's.
