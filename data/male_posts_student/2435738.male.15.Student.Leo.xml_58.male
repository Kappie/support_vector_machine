Full-time report:- PORTUGAL   1-2   GREECE '90+'Sissy' Ron  '7 Karagounis                  '50+ Basinas pen ::'Sissy' Ronaldo pushed a Greek player and caused more trouble than help.(S)he should go home. ::Basinas finished the penalty coolly with a near top-coner shot. ::Portugese fans must be cryin' and cursin' at the sissy. ::Sissy managed to get back his pride after causing the penalty by scoring a header from an inswinging corner.  Conclusion: A shock result to me as i thought it would be a draw.Greeks look good to qualify for the quater-finals.Portugal has to pull their socks up.Their old players(e.g.Figo) are passed their prime and the younger players look hungrier(e.g.Ronaldo,Deco).If they still don't win against Russia,they would be in deep trouble.They have home advantage and if they still don't win.They shouldn't even host the tounament.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_
