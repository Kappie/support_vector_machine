       
      3 speeches in a week should not be allowed. But unfortunately it is, so that took up the majority of my time this past week. Friday I saw  The Chronicles of Riddick  (which surprised me by being a pretty good movie, more on that tomorrow) and worked on my grandparents' computer. Then I had to take the ACT yesterday, go work on 2 different people's computers, and then today I went back to my grandparents to show them how to use the computer after I made the changes to it on Friday. Tomorrow I begin my last week of summer school (which hopefully won't involve a lot of speeches). Life? Lighten up a little.....please.
