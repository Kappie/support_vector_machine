No need to muck these feelings.  Even though he would muck them if he could.  Well, he can muck them but he means that Tyke would rather just not feel this way.  Here's how today went though.  Tyke got up and showered and then he ate a little.  Then he called Ekul and told him the game was on for the day.  He called up Macaroon telling him that he was going to be their 3rd to join with Tyke and Kinker and he was up for it so that was good.  Then Tyke made his jersey.  He had this old Hot Shots jersey from soccer and he didn't care about it but it was a cool jersey so he took it and cut off the short sleeves and the collar and it ended up looking pretty cool for being a real easy job.  It looks kinda like a basketball jersey in fact.  Later on Macaroon came over and they hung out for a while, waiting for Kinker to come over.  When Kinker came they left for Kramm's house and the game.  It was a good game indeed.  Tyke guarded Ekul but Ekul guarded Macaroon.  Macaroon didn't really play up to par.  Probably a double bogey in fact.  Tyke was solid though.  MVP for the team, in fact.  This is based solely on sheer dominance of the paint and percentage of the team's points.  It was another OT thriller but it never really felt that close, even when Team Good was down to game point.  But they pulled it out on Tyke's fadeaway J to put them up 2-0 in the books.  They own at Kramm's house.  Can't be beat.  It was a really fun game.  Tyke scored 15 points of the 25 if they all counted correctly later on that night.  Kinker had 8 and Macaroon had 2.  Which might have been 1 more than Big Twigg had last time he was the 3rd.  So he did well enough.  He had a couple of nice airballs that Tyke plucked out of the air and put in for buckets.  Tyke really had control of the paint.  He was a behemoth on the boards as he says.  After the game the three drove around the plateau a little on their way back to Tyke's.  They tried to see if they could find any of the girls basketball team but they couldn't but they did see BIG's house and saw some nice houses on a beautiful day.  Upon arriving back at the Bachelor Pad they played some ESPN and then they all left.  Tyke took a shower and pretty much left right after that for Dairy Queen in Eastgate for his dinner.  It was good.  Macaroon met up with him there and then they went to BCC for the girls game.  Parking was not possible in most of the area so they had to go all the way back to the normal spots and park there.  It was a fun adventure though.  Then they went in and just sat and tried to create their own cheering section but were pretty unsuccessful as there were a lot of Beach people there and they are scary.  They just are.  So they sat and watched that with Kinker for a while and then Purdy came and she sat in front of them.  The game was really not fun at all though.  Tyke did not have fun.  He hardly talked at all and it just wasn't fun.  Wasn't what he was expecting.  They lost and that just made it worse but it just wasn't as fun as it usually is.  Probably because of the way everyone was seated.  Oh well, can't win em all.  After the game Tyke, Purdy, Kinker, Frederique, and Macaroon waited around for Tina to talk to her about going bowling.  She said she was gonna go so that was cool.  She just had to take the bus back.  So Tyke and Purdy drove over to Sun Villa and Ekul was there so Tyke and him talked for a little but then Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon watched other people bowl for about 25 minutes or so.  It was entertaining at times but not really fun and since bowling cost $5 a game Kinker and Macaroon said they weren't going to bowl.  So it was stupid for a while.  Then Kram and Frederique and Tina and Shawna all showed up so there were more people there.  They got their lanes and went to bowl.  Tyke couldn't find a ball he liked at all so he just settled with one that was pretty bad.  He started off pretty horribly but managed to pick it up and got exactly 100.  Which considering he bowled horribly the entire game really, he did pretty well.  Tyke talked with Purdy and Ekul for most of the time and only talked with Tina a little.  It was still cool though cuz they never hang out.  But then after only one game Ekul and Purdy left so Tyke had nothing to do either so he left.  He said his goodbyes but again goodbyes aren't fun with a lot of people around.  If that doesn't make sense it's ok.  Cuz Tyke knows what he means and in this case that's all that matters.  Kinker was still there though so they went up to Macaroon's and got him and Tyronious and played some midnight bball at Cougar Ridge.  It was gay.  Wasn't fun and it was cold.  Oh well, can't win em all.  Then Tyke went home and got home remarkably quick.  He thinks he was going pretty fast on the freeway but just didn't notice it.  He wasn't really paying attention to be truthful.  He just kinda was floating home.  So there's the day.  Now for the rest.  Today came back something that hasn't been here for a while.  Since school really.  Maybe the week before the last week even.  But it hasn't been here all break.  And that is cuz Tyke hasn't been hanging out with any girl at all.  And you know what, that actually makes things better sadly.  Just because the girls he hangs out with don't have to give what Tyke wants to receive.  He can't get the kind of attention he really wants because of who it is he spends his time with.  And on nights like this Tyke is really in a position he doesn't want to be in.  Bowling was ok just because it was fun talking to Ekul and Purdy.  But it just isn't what Tyke wants.  He almost doesn't want to hang out with the girls on nights like this because he knows that afterwards he isn't going to be happy.  He never is.  It's a curse that truly does plague him.  His friendships are all cool and it is fun when he just gets to hang out with them but when it is just a bunch of his friends with their boyfriends, it gets to Tyke.  Maybe it doesn't "get to Tyke" but it just is not what he wants the situation.  And in reality, Tyke really doesn't think he feels how he feels now because of a particular girl.  It is just his situation.  He just really really hates being alone.  He is a very social person and he really wants his need to be filled.  The problem is the girls he chases can't fulfill his needs.  And now he realizes that and that has actually helped him.  His feelings toward people have changed in some respects just because of what it is he knows.  He is looking for certain qualities now in a girl.  And he really does know what it is.  That is something he has never known before.  He just has had a reaction to some girls but he didn't really know what it was.  Now he knows what he needs in a girl.  But of course, this doesn't solve the problem.  It doesn't make it worse but it is no aid to Tyke either.  But on nights like tonight where it is just a bunch of couples and Tyke it is far from his desire.  All of the little pecks and hugs and high fives and rubs are just too much.  Tyke sort of needs to distance himself from all of this.  He needs to just find something else that he needs to do or something to keep himself occupied.  His mind is always thinking about things and that makes it harder but he still knows what he needs to do.  The harder part is just acting on that and sticking to it.  All of this is somewhat repetitive and bland but it is the truth.  Tyke is simply looking for something he won't be able to find.  He just hates thinking about things and then he always compares himself to his peers and wonders why he isn't like that.  Or why he hasn't done anything like that in the past.  Why it was always other people doing everything while Tyke sat home alone with his parents watching a movie and eating popcorn.  He really wonders why it is he having this kind of situation when he thinks about how he is always such good friends with everyone.  He doesn't know of many people who truly don't like him and that bothers him in a way.  Because if there are so many people who say things to Tyke that he thinks mean something, then why is there nobody who has feelings for him?  Almost a paradox.  Not really but Tyke would like to think his situation is paradoxical.  So much there but nothing to come of it.  As is life.
