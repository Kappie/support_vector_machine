I was looking at the clock as it closing in to 9:45am, and I got a sms at 9:44am. AAAhhhhhhh….. just one more minute, just one more minute!!! I didn’t get a chance to break my miss call record. Why oh Why can’t sleeping beauty sleep a little longer? Sigh~  Around noon, got another sms from Tara… Oohh… she got herself another Doraemon from comics connection around my place. With 3more to go, I think she getting more and more anxious. Hehehheee….. ok back to me. I am feeling damn weak, so I slept a lot more. Wake up and sleep, wake up and sleep, wake up and sleep…. There wasn’t much I could do, except for stoning in front of the com before dinner time, and watching tv programs.   Cannot Tahan any longer, I took Panador cold and hopped into bed. Then I realize that channel 8 was showing GTO special, and I stay wide awake watching it…
