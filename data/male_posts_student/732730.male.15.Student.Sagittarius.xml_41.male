Because We Canâ„¢.  It'll be your standard soapie, with all the typical plots: sex, lies and murder... Yay!  Thirdly, you may recall me posting a screenie of the BB5 layout I'm working on. It's been tinkered with a bit, so wrap you eye-candy (BAHA) on this:  urlLink http://adam.l2p.net/lightbox/temp/bb5m2.gif  (.gif image, 62kb, 800x900). It continues to need quite a bit of work, but that can be done easily. I might start coding the HTML and CSS this weekend, if I can be bothered...
