Anyway, rumors goin' 'round 'bout that pesky WINAMP 5, turns out, there's a "Final" version comin' out that's yet tyo be announced. Its already appeared over .torrent, and its major improvement should be enough of an incentive to make you download it. Appareantly, the idiots noticed that it eats up a LOOOT of your system resources, sooo, they've released a "Final" version, which alleviates this frustrating problem. The  urlLink Winamp homepage  should be updated soon, dun worry, the release is indeed official.  If anyone has any memory, what-so-ever, they would remember I made a post a while back about a contest held on the  urlLink Internet Nirvana Fan Club  homepage where you could win a Jag-Stang if you covered a Nirvana song and sent it in to the person who owns the guitar. Well, I don't care if you don't, the contest has been on hold since Nov. 29 th because the guitar's owner has given no response to any e-mails or the like and has been deemed "unvailable." Sucks for the people who sent their shit in, the contest was s'posed to be over Dec. 1st, but these people are gonna haveta wait. Maybe it was a ll a scam? Who knows. I'd like to get my hands on that Jag-Stang...  For the immature little pervert in all of us, and for a few good laughs, check out  urlLink this page . Click the button, and laugh or get weirded out, then click for more! Here's an example: "Grappling the bologna pony"  I'm Deadinside, and Happy Whatever-you-celebrate/believe-in!  "The Magical 'Disappearing Finger' Trick"  :: nudge, nudge:: Get it? Get it?! I'm gonna get it for this!
