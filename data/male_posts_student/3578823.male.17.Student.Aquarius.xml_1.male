I haven't done anything physical in 4 weeks...and then BAM, I come here and have to drag my 35-Pound computer(and the monitor), my backpack, my suitcase, and some other crap up to the 3rd freakin' floor.I was all sweaty and tired before anything really began. I met my counselee group and I'm unsure if I will really be able to befriend them, moreso that they might not want to befriend me. My Tutor Counseler is pretty cool so far, I can already tell that he's going to make my summer better by his attitude. The food here is the same as always, and I've seen a lot of familiar faces, and a lot of new ones. I hope I can meet them all..hehe. And I also got to play Ultimate Frisbee today!!! I *heart* UB.   Word of the day--Bedizen:bih-DY-zuhn:[transitive verb] To dress or adorn in gaudy manner.
