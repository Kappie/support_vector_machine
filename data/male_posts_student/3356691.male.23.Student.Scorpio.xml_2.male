Surely, she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star. Look at her skin. Who does her hair?" In that moment, I knew that someday we'd end up like this, like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza. I said to Lolo, who was supposed to be one of my friends, "Dude, I'm in love. Could this siren love me? Are the gods that kind?" Lolo turned to me, opened his drowsy eyes and said, "Who you think you are? A knight in shining armor, riding a white horse? Why don't you just go to sleep again and stop exclaiming from you god damn dream?"
