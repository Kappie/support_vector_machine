Whatever reason it is this time around I can not seem to shake it.  I took a shower and that did not help me. I seemed to think more, and more.  I have realized over the past 2 days or so...That I seem to be the sidekick.  I am like Tetsouo to Kanada in Akira. Knuckles to Sonic in Sonic. And so on, and so on.  Right now I guess the best way to say how I am really feeling...I feel a lot like Raziel in Soul Reaver Defiance. There is some force working hard against me, that is keeping me from reaching my goal. The Harder I struggle the harder I fall back to were I started...It is one vicouse sycle. I do not know what is causing these feelings...I just know they are here.  there is also noone that I can really talk to about this either. That is probably one of the more depressing things about this... *sigh* I think I am actually jelouse a bit. But the only person I have to blame is myself...Yes, IT IS ALL MY FAULT! I let myself learn emotion. I let things happen to me. IT IS ALL MY DAMN FAULT!
