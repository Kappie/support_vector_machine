Seems the Demand for pugs ( The breed of Dog that appears in the commercial) has increased steeply ever since the Ad. Exams,bathroom,Soccer the pug follows him everywhere !! .... Great Concept,nicely conceived , wonderful music . The pug which acted belongs to a Farmhouse in Goa and seems the cute kid is from Bangalore.                                             I have the highest respect for O and Mccann-Erickson when it comes to creative advertising.
