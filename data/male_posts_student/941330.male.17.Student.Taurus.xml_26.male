OK, maybe maim...or ravage...or fight...considering it's me, it would probably be more like poke randomly. You get the point though. I hope. The frets aren't so wide, and it's a lot easier to carry. Plus, with an amp...so cool.   I haven't found so much time to practice though...silly AIM...there's not enough hours in the day anymore. I'm sleeping at 11:30 again...woohoo. Mr. Lott is a fruitcake. We spent our whole weekends working on our history projects, then he spits in our face and says we didn't follow exact MLA procedure. Even though we followed the exact format in   his own packet.   Oh well. I want to read  Count of Monte Cristo  now, Eugene says it's good. Actually I have read it before...like, the   My First Reader   version.  Decision time. Track...or badminton...sigh...
