"Well, let's see...we've thrown in an arse-load of hacking, dungeon crawling, taking pictures of stuff, making yer own cities...but we need ONE more thing so that no one EVER leaves their room... we can...RACE FISH! BWAHAHAHAHA!"  It's crazy. The single act of racing fish brings such gladness into my heart. When Susan the Fish came in first place at the First Anual Fish Racing-a-rama,I swear I heard the angelic chorus singing.  Another odd thing: writing in this damn blog is strangely addictive. I bet smokers feel this way..." Well, I'm coughing up black shit and I sound like a sawmill...but these Marlboros have one helluva smooooth aftertaste...mmm, suicide..." Of course, blogging is much safer.  We hope.  Oh, and to der Amanda-- How goes the Tennessee-visiting-process?  -Dice Squirrel Inquisitive Rodent
