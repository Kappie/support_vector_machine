A great swell of pity goes out for the diseased vermin/children brought kicking and screaming into the world today. It's sad to think that you will never make past the age of thirty. Sucks to be you.  Also, I am posting because I should be rewriting my term paper, but you know what? Fuck that. Fuck that fucking shit up its fucking unformed ass. Actually scratch that. I will not go down in a flame of stupidity along with all the other drama queens. Who cares that I have spent this entire weekend working on that damned musical? Or that I have skipped lunch for the past week to work on it? HOLD IT! What did I say about being a whiny drama queen? So stop it! Anyways, I've joined the glamorous circles of playboy, people, and the bible for crapper reading, so I must rise above! I will say this though; If I didn't admire and aspire to be a Romantic and/or Byronic Hero so much, I would have killed every last person in this damned show.  Some of the people are cool I guess. The only reason I don't gush is that I don't want to add fodder for the people (like me) who simply read blogs to find out what the author thinks about others. Us gossip whores are stinkers, ain't we?  Yep, that about wraps it up I guess.   Wow, Lord of the Rings won ten or eleven oscars. Huh. I guess people weren't lying when they said New Zealand was a real country. Guess I should write a paper.
