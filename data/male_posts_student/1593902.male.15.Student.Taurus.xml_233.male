Blues Clues was cute, funny, intuitive. This crap is well, crap.  ya know, every generation has their shows. Shows they grew up with.  the three shows i remember the most are  Full House (olsen twins alert!Their legal now! YES!) Family Matters (URCLE!) AND Boy Meets World. (Corey is the man)  Other day i got all nostalgic with Shayan (though she didn't realize it) looking at other shows.  The Journey of Allen Strange on Nick (notice that most of these shows are on Nick, its not until NOW that Disney has gotten good) The secret World of Allen Mack. hell look what i found from nick.com   On her first day of junior high, Alexandra Mack was accidentally doused with a mysterious chemical called GC-161 and it changed her life forever. Now Alex is the only high schooler she knows who can zap electricity from her fingertips, morph into an oozing blob of goo, and even make other people morph just by touching them. But having superpowers isn't all just fun and games—the company bigwigs that make GC-161 know that some kid was sprayed with the stuff and they'll stop at nothing to find her, so Alex has to keep the powers secret. And Alex's powers aren't easy to hide—especially when they make her glow unexpectedly. But with the help of her best friend, Ray, and her genius sister, Annie, Alex manages to avoid being discovered and keep away from that truck that keeps following her around.    THAT'S CLASS!  One of the funniest shows i EVER saw was the angry beavers..  I remember with the first girlfriend i ever had, leticia nuñez :-D at lunch (remember iw as cute AND funny and likeable when i was little) always getting stuck as danny Tamborelli(sp) the red haired kid from Nick who all the kids liked during lunch aorund our group of friends. I also used to be the black duded that went WITH YOUR HOST SUMMMMMMERRRRR SANDERSSSS! HE was awesome!  Danny Tamberelli was also in the erm, movies Mighty Ducks. I can still see those movies (and yes i'm one of the few losers who still screams QUACK QUACK!   I just read this and agree 100%   "I myself thought that "All That" was great when it started. It had an array of funny cast members (especially Lori Beth Denberg, Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, and Katrina I forget her last name), and funny sketches too for that matter. But then in its 2nd season we would soon learn that a cast member would leave the show every year when it was clear Angelique Bates left, and was replaced by that annoying, and unfunny Amanda Bynes. Man she sucks. Her Ask Ashley sketch was bad, and she was lousy from the day she appeared. Soon Katrina, and Alsyse Reyes left, (I think this was around the 3rd season) and they get replaced with the unfunny Leon Fryerson, and Christy Knowings. However Danny Tambereli was the only good new cast member that arrived during the show's run. He was good in his "Detective Dan" sketch, but he was bad as Lori Beth's replacement for "Vital Information" which now leads us to the 4th season. In this season Lori Beth Denberg, and Kel Mitchell leave, and are replaced with that loser Mark Saul, and that unfunny, and annoying Nick Cannon. By now Kenan Thompson, and Josh Server are the only remaining original cast members. The show went downhill at this point because of the departure of Lori Beth, and Kel and it only got worse from there. Kenan leaves prior to the 1999-2000 season, and is replaced by Gabriel Iglasias (who wasn't that amusing at all). By then I had given up on "All That for good. It just wasn't fuuny anymore. The humor was more aimed at a younger age around that time, which of course to Nickelodeon is bad.  Unfortuantly, "All That" premiered its 7th season last night on the now mediocre new "Snick" (which sucks as bad as Snick House.) with an all new cast of kids. These kids are terribly unfunny, and the sketches are lame, and dumb (Toy E.R. is example of how lame the sketches are. A doctor fixing toys? What's up with that?). I only saw a bit of the episode, and I had completly had enough of it very quickly. Why did Nickelodeon decide to make an all new season with an all new cast? Especially since this show went downhill? They should have just just killed this show off when Lori Beth left. Seriosly they should've. This show just isn't "All That" anymore. "   All that USED to be the shiznit, Lori beth i remember was that fat chick who was hilarious, she wasn't that good but she was funny. Now these new kids suck. The humor on the show is absolute shit. NICK CANNON? WHAT I WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR THEM?  Nickolodeons going the way of the dodo really, i when I was growing up (earlier growing up:p) They would never have thrown somethign like that.   and you guys remember Wild and Crazy Kids? and the one with the temple....erm.... FUCK what was it called. the Temple of doom! is all i remember not waht it was called, erm...Secrets of teh hiden legend? Now i'm on a mission, brb  back, Legends of the Hidden Temple!  urlLink HAAHAHAHAH!  or  urlLink here   Guts! Guts was great too, man, i remember dreaming i was one of them. Ah well. I'm off to school i'll finsih this as i come back
