Whilst (ok, don't know if that is the proper usage) I was away in Canada, I watched  Canadian Idol . For all of you out there who despise  American Idol  and  American Juniors  this show would make you want to shun television for the rest of your natural born lives. I am not a huge fan of the "Idol" series, although I watch a few episodes here and there, but this was just.... agonizing! The people couldn't really sing at all and they were already down to the final 6! I have to admit, however, that there were some energetic and talented singers in this final group. Yet, that was a very very very small number. What is the moral of me telling you this? Be careful of what you watch on T.V. it may hurt your brain!  Ha ha   On to other important, ok, less important news.....   Operation: Revolution  should be underway shortly. I have to think about what we said (or maybe I said) that would be changing around here.... Oh, I know! A  CD or book review . Immediately following this blog entry I will review the novel,   Rats Saw God   ! Look for it, soon.  For now, thats about it. Stay tuned.
