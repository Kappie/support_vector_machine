In the black as oil corner, and just as greasy, weighing in at a feather weight somethin-or-other pounds.... GEORGE "DON'T FUCK WITH MY DADDY" W BUSH!!!  And his challenger for the evening, in the red, white, and blue corner we have, weighing in at something-or-other pounds.... MICHAEL MOORE!!!  LLLLLLLLLET'S...... GET READY TO RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!!!!!!!    Yes, as you can probably guess, I just got back from seeing Moore's latest offering "Farenheit 9/11" and I gotta say, even though, yes, it is biased, and yes, we do all know he wants Bush out of the White House as soon as possible come hell nor high water, his documentary was a definite eye-opener. Fuck, I don't even know where to begin.  Some of the file footage like the public beheading, the young Iraqi child with half his head stitched up and crying out as they tried to stitch up the top of his head, the napalmed people, the dead bodies... what can I say? It's all fucked up. Moore gets his message across and he's as subtle as a brick in the head (or as in the case of some of the people, shrapnel). The thing is, it takes this sort of slap to the face to get people to wake up and smell the proverbial "napalm in the morning".   Homeland Security? What a fucking joke! For a country supposedly built on the freedom of people those citizens were all too quick to let their rights be signed away.  And the opening sequence where not one single senator would sign the forms about thousands of African-American people not being allowed to vote in the election that Al Gore actually won. What's up with that?? What the fuck is wrong with this world people??  I am scared. I am truly fucking scared. And not because of all the "acts of terrorism". I'm scared because I'm seeing a world becoming more and more ignorant of what's happening around them and living in a constant state of fear because of a few dickheads with delusions of granduer!  I'm training to be a teacher. What the fuck do I say to these kids when they ask me "why"? What's my answer? Because the world's a screwed up place that's being run by screwed up people? Despite the fact that it's the truth, I won't be able to say it. Why? Because of the few people with all the fucking power. That's why. Just look at the school that's getting screwed over because they entered the Rock Eistedford with a routine that asks questions about Bush and Howard and the whole "War on Terror". A few conservative wankers are up in arms about it. Oh boo hoo! Why don't the influential minority just fuck off and actually listen to the majority for once? Because that's not actually how a democracy works apparently. It isn't the majority that makes decisions, it's the rich minority. Well, from me, go fuck yourselves you ignorant, blind, money-hungry, fucking tools!   Lowman X, out.    "A dictatorship'd be easier." -G W Bush.
