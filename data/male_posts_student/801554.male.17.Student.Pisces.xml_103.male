The other day in Chemistry class, we had a vacuum machine (sucks all the air out of something) and were doing some pretty cool stuff. We put a jar of shaving cream in there and turned on the vacuum, and the shaving cream gets exponentially large. It just keeps growing and growing. But that's what you pay for in shaving cream, air. Boyle's gas law or something. And we put a balloon in there, but that's not as interesting, it just gets larger and then pops.
