I had alfred, dan, mike(alfred's friend), jason, chris, and jake on my team...we played a total of 4 games i think...during the last game though my hitting was pretty impressive...if only i had mike setting during both club and high school season, that would b awesome cuz he sets awesome...after we played, alfred wanted me to get a video of my playin so he can show that to his coach, and this could b the ticket for me playin vball at a D-1 college, which is totally awesome to the max! So hopefully everything goes to plan, and then next year i will b attending the University of Hawaii...w0rd. Tomorrow me and dave are goin to playin at a beach tourney in Manhattan beach. Hopefully we will do well cuz i think this is jus our 2nd week playin together, so hopefully we will kick ass...i miss steph, it kinda sux during the summer cuz i don't get to see her that often cuz we don't have school right now. She said that her sis is comin over to visit this weekend so hopefully we will have an opportunity to see each other next week...i hope...payce.
