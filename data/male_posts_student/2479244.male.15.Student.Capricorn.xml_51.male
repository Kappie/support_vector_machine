Its easy for most people to do what they want to do and to get done what they want done but  I am bad with myself in the sense that I cannot express what I feel or what I know or what I want because  I am just not like that. But there is a time period that I will cross and there is an event I know will happen that will change all of that and  If I want something to work  I will try so hard for it and I will be happy when it finally does.
