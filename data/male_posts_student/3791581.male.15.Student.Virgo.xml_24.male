The board exams went alright; I can't commit myself to saying I did well or poorly, but I can say that I tried my very best.I don't find out how I did until late Sept/Oct.  So today, I'll work for an hour and a half, then read a book by the beach if it's not too hot. We've been getting great weather lately, and it sure makes my little celebration that much sweeter. I hope to just relax for the next two weeks, recoup, get lots of sleep, eat right, and hit the gym... (I mean it this time!)     As for the rest of you, what are you up to? I think we should extend the blog to the other halves - Jay, JP, Jamie, Norm. It would be nice to keep in touch with them too.  Until my next post...have a beautiful week!
