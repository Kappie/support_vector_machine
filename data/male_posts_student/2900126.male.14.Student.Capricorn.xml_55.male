Most of you guys already know who the person is that I'm going out with she's smart, funny, nice, and all that good stuff. So yeah well that's the good part.        The bad partis my mom said she would be here on Friday to pick me up so I could go over her house and I'm still here. But yeah I'm really not that down about it because I already knew that it would take her a long time to come and get me and I've had more time to talk to my friends and new gf. Because for one I want to talk to then before they leave because like Kiara is leaving in like an hour and a half for a night in Miami and then she is going on a cruise and she'll be in the Bahamas when she gets off the boat. *so kewl, I know* Then Sonya is going to Canada on like Thursday and staying there for almost the whole summer. LinZ is going to New York sometimes I think this week coming, wait, it might be the week after this week I can't remember. Stephanie *yea "blondie" yer one of my friends* is going to Colorado. And then I'm going to Florida on the 8th of August and I'm gunna go to Disney World for the first time in a long time, I think the last time I went to Disney World was when I was like 5. But yeah it should be fun.        CHICHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE MISS YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
