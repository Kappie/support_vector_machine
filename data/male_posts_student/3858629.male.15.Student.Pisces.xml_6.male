I woke up and Mark called, so I talked to him for a while. After that, I made myself lunch and watched 'Days of Our Lives'. I was laughing very hard at the "shark" in the water that was chasing after Hope and Patrick, and - later - Bo.  When 'Passions' was well into its second half, I set off for work and was again bombarded by swarming insects. My neighbors  really  need to call in an exterior exterminator. If one exists. Somewhere out there.  Work was really dull today, because there were about twelve people swimming and not one of them was hungry or in need of anything. So I basically stood there by myself while Chris (my employer) spent City money paying all the other workers to make confetti for her daughter's baby shower. Since no one was really there though, I just sort of hung out with Sarah and Stephanie and the lifeguard-trainees while I could. And Nick and Rachael, because they're always there when they're not supervising.  After work, my dad took me to Wal-Mart to pick out Mark's birthday present. His birthday was over a month ago, but his party's tomorrow. Which... is a little unusual, but still all good.  Immediately upon my return from Wal-Mart, I turned on 'I Love the 90s' and was thrilled to see a mention of 'Pulp Fiction'.  Then I got on the computer and was bombarded by messages from people wasting their time talking to me. I'm boring. And they should know that.  Right, and I think I'm changing the name of my blog. Eventually...
