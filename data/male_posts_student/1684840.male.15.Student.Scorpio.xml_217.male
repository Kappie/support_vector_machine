So, here I am in the last summer I will beexperiencing in the UK for a long time. Ever since the approval everything has been speeding up so fast, and now we even have the date for our interview in London at the US Embassy. I can almost feel the plane taking off on that one way journey which we will soon be boarding, and it is only weeks away.  After coming home from the great break from reality in France and especially London, I have been soaking up the heat and laze of the school holidays. Blink-128 blasting on the speakers and any hardcore punk or emomusic that takes my fancy really. Ordered my phunky new wireless mouse which arrived today, and is seriously wacky. It opens up a whole new chapter of bed-surfing and showing off moving the cursor from the far bedroom wall. The wicked digital camera I bought got send to Sheldon's house and is now on its way back to mee.  Can't wait to go to Alton Towers this month!We still haven't been able to give Grandma adate to book it because there's a chance we could bring the interview date forward, but I'm sure in 31 speedy days we shall be exiting the US Embassy happy and excited that the next day we shall be recieving 4 amazing 'tickets' to our near-future lives. It will be really cool to revisit Alton Towers again and be able to ride everything we want to (as long as we get a themed suite and the axellerator passes) I'm going to push myself on everything, from Black Hole to Air, and I don't care if it rains, it will be a more interesting experience!  Having already packed one case, my room is quite empty now, and very messy! My school uniform is sitting on top of the case I am soon to pack, as if to say "Where the hell am I supposed to go now!?" I wanted to burn it but we best keep it, just in case. That's what Mum said anyway, but I don't see myself returning to that excuseof a"civilised comunity!"  I'm going to learn to drive as soon as I can when I move because I want to get the hang of it at an early age. I am a little nervous, but who wouldn't be if they were going to be driving soon on busy roads and in America as well! I really can't wait to get over there and start getting used to it all. I'm sure there are a lot of differences to our road system etc.  Becky and Chris want to come and wave me off at the airport when I leave, which is really nice. I can't believe I'm going to be leaving all my close friends and people I can talk to back here while I bugger off and start my new life. There is still MSN and everything but it won't be the same. I can't wait to come back when I'm 18, and I haven't even left yet! I never knew growing up could be so much fun. My friends keep on saying they want to come and visit me and have holidays in Texas and stuff after I've gone. Most of it is probably just fantasy, but I can imagine some of them coming over in the future, I;m sure whatever happens, it will be a right laugh.  So here I am, the clock has turned 3:24 and I have been sitting here for about 30 minutes writing this. My wireless mouse is on charge (because I keep using it up!) and I think I'll go to bed and listen to some Enya... mwhahaha!
