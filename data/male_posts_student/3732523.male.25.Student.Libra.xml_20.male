I finish a load and a new pile of dirty clothes appears out of nowhere. I fear they are reproducing. I fear they will take over my apartment and hold me hostage. At times I can almost hear them planning their next moves.   They've taken over the kitchen. I still have the bedroom, but everytime I look away their army piles get closer. I fear I will not be able to hold them off much longer. I may need to relocate into the living room. I have planned an alternate way into the living room in case things get too bad.  [20 mins later...]  The bedroom has been seiged. They've completly overtaken it. I am hiding in the corner of my living room. I've been living off what little food I could find - a couple of frootloops, and some popcorn stuck in between the cushions of the couch. God only knows how long I will be here. They will find me. It's only a matter of time.   [25 more minutes pass...]  I fear I will not last much longer. The piles of dirty laundry are too much for me to handle. I have been able to fend them off for a little while using what little resources I could steal from the closet - half a bottle of tide and a few cups of Purex. My resouces are running out fast. It is only a matter of time before I am a POW.  Tell my parents I love them. Tell my sister I am proud of her. Tell my gf to move on and find someone else. Tell them all not to worry... tell them...
