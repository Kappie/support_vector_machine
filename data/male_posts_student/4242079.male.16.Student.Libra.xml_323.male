I haven't had a lot to say lately. Some of my longer term readers my remember the short story I had started a while back:   He sits. Stroking the cat. He is bored. Life has been feeling so wasted lately. Such educational pursuits as downloading porn and listening to "You're Pretty When I'm Drunk" by the Bloodhound Gang just aren't fulfilling him anymore. People fill their lives with such trivial things. A young woman flashes on his screen. Such a beautiful lady, reduced to nothing more than a nameless promotion for an equally nameless casino. Gambling never really appealed to him. As he is about to close the window that has interrupted his game of solitare, he notices her eyes. Beautiful. Shimmering. Sad.   I think I might finish it. Although, I don't remember where I intended to take the characters...perhaps.   The toaster pops as the smell of burnt waffle fill the air. He ignores the flashing orange box at the bottom of his screen, indicating a new instant message.  Let the waffles cool
