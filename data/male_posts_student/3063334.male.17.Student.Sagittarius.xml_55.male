The different hidden symbols found in the artwork and the secret organization of the Priory of Sion is just so interesting. However if you do read it I recommend you go online and look at some of the paintings discussed in the book. This will give you a good visual of what's described in the book. It's very entertaining and it allows you to explore new ideas. It's also fun to try to solve the different puzzels throughout the book.
