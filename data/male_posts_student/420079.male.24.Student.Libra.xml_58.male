The only problem is, they assign us  so damn much  reading in law school, that we have no time to read all our text really closely! We have to read fast, and then only closely examine some parts when we feel we've come to something worth closely examining. But then we're missing so much! And how do we know what's worth examining and what isn't? It all is, dammit -- it all is!  Grrrrr. I want a four point.  Oh, yeah, I guess I should mention a little something about my three month absence.  I was busy.  That's about it, really. A recap: First I had to finish up the first semester by kicking it into overdrive. Then I took my Torts final, and got the flu, and about a week later I wrote my Crim Law take home exam in another stunning all-nighter, and then two days later I took my Contracts exam. Then I went home and crashed for a few days. Hung out with old friends, made amazing new ones. ;-)  Went to the Virgin Islands -- that was fun! Came back. Came back to school. Went to Tucson! Then back to school. Worked hard, worked not so hard, worked hard again, got SICK, headaches and fatigue, got better. Currently trying to pull everything together into a grand vista of knowledge in my head.  Also during the break, about a billion friends got engaged. One friend, in addition to doing this, also got a job as one of President Bush's speechwriters. Go Lee!  And that is all. I am now back and Ready to Rumble (TM to somebody else). Okay, back to reading.  :-)
