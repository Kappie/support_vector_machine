I frequently come across stuff that I somehow did not pay adequate attention to. Today, I came across this:  Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.  - Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)  I think I missed this one because it had an SEP field around it ;-)
