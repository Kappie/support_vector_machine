The call of Christ for us to love Him was so clear and that the action of our love should be our total devotion to Him was crystal clear.  It was great.  The Bible study is on for tomorrow, 5:30-7:30.  For those who don't have the book, I have been able to get some.  So don't worry about buying it.  I wrote earlier about praying that I have a desire to have my devotions.  Well, someone prayed b/c last night I read straight through Romans.  I didn't ever want to stop either.  It was exactly what I needed too.  Thank God. I got to go.  PRAY
