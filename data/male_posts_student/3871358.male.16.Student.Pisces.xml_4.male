Hello, hello, hello... The reason for this serenity is because it is currently 3:30 am and the world, at least that part of the world situated closest to this nighttime scribbler, is asleep. Asleep that is, except for the cat, David Gilmour’s guitar, and me.     Greetings O traverser of the information highway. My name is Davey Heitler (any jokes about the name to ouchwhydidyoujuststabmeintheeyewithapen@hotmail.com). You may have heard of me through various medical journals, troubled hearsay, or perhaps even by meeting me as was traditional before the downfall of polite society. I hope you are sitting comfortably, or failing that, at least not too uncomfortably. Welcome to my blog, Euphoria's the way!      ( urlLink   if you happened to just wander on here purely by accident and are desperately searching for a way out). I shall endeavour most mightily to post new and interesting comments as often as possible, but i'm not God, mores the pity, so don't fall into despair if I don't post every day. A little despair is perfectly acceptable; just remember to keep everything in perspective.     Anyway, those who have bothered to read the first paragraph (I know, I know, sometimes your excitement can get the better of you, causing you to involuntarily skip to the net paragraph with an exaggerated literary spasm) may well be wondering what I am doing up at 3:30 in the morning. Those free of a fear for paragraphs begining with 'It' should read on to find out...                   It was a blustery July day when myself and my loyal companions, the illustrious Conor McStay and the indefectible Gordon Strachan (who for some reason has taken to calling himself ‘The Messiah’. Oh, and eating raw fish. This needn’t worry you. It worries us, but it needn’t worry you.) Set out on are arduous quest for redemption, absolution of sin and enlightenment. Yup, you guessed it, we were camping in Tensmuir forest. Those of you with a bit of the lawyer about you will know this is illegal, so I say to you: Out!                   Anyway, as we boldly set forth, strong were our hearts and bright was the sky. The whole village of Tayport came out to bid us farewell, many of the children throwing flowers at our feet. Ahem. Okay, maybe not flowers. Alright, alright, we were given spiteful glances from any of the locals that condescended to look our way, and we were ravished by a horde of bison. I mean neds. I wonder why I just typed Bison. Urkk, the delete key is to far way, to lazy to move, urkk, nope, can’t reach. Oh well.                   After a quick satop of at the local “we help you so you don’t have to or some such shit” Co Op to stack up on supplies, namely lots of comfort food and drink, we set off into the dark heart of the foreboding forest.                   A little aside here. Try shouting out loud the word Magma. Go on, don’t be shy. M-A-G-M-A. There, I can guarantee that’s the best word you’ll shout all day. Now, back to the story.                   Luckily we had scouted for locations the preceding night, so we knew where to set up camp. Which is what we did, with some of the grooviest, funkiest, superlative to the power of thirty two music I’ve heard in a long time. Those of you still in shock from that last sentence could do worse than listening o radio 3 at around 11:00 pm. Trust me, you’ll thank me one day. At least I would if I were you. Then again, if I were you I wouldn’t be wearing these pants (very astute of me), so perhaps its for the best that I’m me and you’re you.                   Cue campfire and campfire talk involving pirates (oo-arr) female posteriors (oo-arr) and illegal substances (oo-arr mister “I have principles T the Messiah”). All was dark and quite, save for the gentle crackoling of dying fire embers. A few stars were winking at us in a rather provocative manner, causing Gordo to get a little excited. Then suddenly we heard it.                   “Rooaarrggrrffnnhhoowwwllggrrffhh.”                   The preceding line of letters completely fails to do justice to the unearthly wail/sneeze that we heard. Conor was up a tree shaking in fright, I was lying there, my heart pounding in my chest like a whippet in a bowler hat. Gordon was still talking wistfully about lady chums, being a little slow on the uptake. Eeek, there it is again!                   Those of you out there thinking what a bunch of girls blouses, quite, you might set Gordon of again. All I can say to you is you’d have had to have been there. Suffice to say I was a little bit on the wrong side of terrified, being all on our lonesome on a beach (we actually set up camp a little out of the forest on a handy beach).                   Anhyhoo, my fear was short-lived as we recalled the numerous seals we had already seen basking on the sand earlier that very evening. It was then, with new found purpose in our steps, that we decided to go down on to the beach and confirm our suspicions.                   Guess what? We were right, it was seals! Lots and lots of seals howling ot the moon like some pack of rather soggy wolves. By happy coincidence a reddish glow was just beginning to appear over the horizon, turning the clouds into wonderful blobs of pink cand floss in the sky. It was quite nice, so we lay on the beach in our sleeping bags as the sun rose.                   Gordon and Conor, being the energetic loonies that they are decided to fly their kites, and being the lazy shite that I am, I watched.                   After that we decided to go on an early morning cycle, which passed without incident, save Conor getting all worked up about “cannibal gremlins and goblins living in the woods who like to feast on yellow helmeted cyclists.” After I explained to him that cannibal meant they ate each other, and that, as he was not to my knowledge either a goblin or a gremlin, he was perfectly safe. These fears laid to rest we headed back to camp.                   And that is about it. We packed up the tent (which we never actually used) and then cycled home, at around 7:00 in the morning. I then spent the rest of the day asleep, but I have it on good authority that both of my accomplices went on to make full use of their day. Un-lazy gits.                   We had a camera with us, so I will post some pictures of strange slug like creatures on the beach, creatures that bear more than a passing resemblance to us in sleeping bags in fact. Until then that’s all from me folks, drive home safely tonight. I don’t want you hitting me.                   Thanks for reading                                  Stay Beautiful                                                            Davus
