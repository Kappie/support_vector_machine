I wonder how many people will realize I'm kidding, I can think of a few that won't... you can guess who I'm thinking of in comments and then I'll tell you if you're right.  So people's gawking at Arnaud wasn't as full-fledged as I thought it might be.  Then again, he didn't say all that much, so there you go.  An hour ago, my mother had a big fight with her sister, and then the latter went to fume in her car, and then later came back.  Don't people ever outgrow that kind of thing?
