I wish I could be everywhere at once and yet at the same time nowhere at all. Why can't I just be the center of the universe? things would be much simpler then I think.  I start a new job over at Dairy Queen tomorrow. I'm a little bit indifferent to it though. No jitters, no excitement. I would have thought I'd have some kind emotion concerning this. Sometimes I questoin myself about how I can feel so indifferent about swerious occurances in my life. it's like I have no frontal lobe at all. However I find my autonomy distressful and then realize that I am not a robot after all. None=the=less sometimes, I wish I had the ability to cry. Is that strange to anyone?  To conclude my thoughts, let's take a break to the lighter side of things and speak of ballacrosse. I love to play with my friends! It is the greatest game ever. In fact, some day I will post some rules on this site so that all may play. How exciting! haha. Today Scott, Jacob, Kara, Bryan, Brandon and I played for about 2 hours I think. The most intense it has ever been. I only hope to play more ballacrosse all summer long.
