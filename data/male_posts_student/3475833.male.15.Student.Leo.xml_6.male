Tons of fun those are. I might get my braces off in 2 months tho. That'd be awesome. Red, White, and Blue colors now. Boring Boring Boring  Next we head to Alyssa's house. We, I mean my mom and I, what a hootin' party that is. No, I don't mind my mom. But we pick up the lovely Alyssa and we head on over to Tinseltown to see Dodgeball staring Ben Stiller. Great Movie, Very Funny. I love the story of it. Awesome all together.  Then we, the party including Alyssa now, head to my sister's day care to pick her up. Then we, the party now including my sister, head to Alyssa's house.  At Alyssa's house, the party loses it's founding member and Alyssa. I stay at Alysa's house until 6:30. About an hour. Lots of fun as always. I'll get my 'What I learned' list later.  Then we headed out to babysit. Great fun. Really. The munchkins actually listened to me. Alyssa sucks at hide and seek. And I'll get the list later.  Got back around midnight-1:00. Went to bed after catching up on CB. Then at 7:00 the family left the house and headed to BGSU, to see the grad ceremony for BBS. Lots of fun to see it all happen. But no matter where you are in Ohio, it still seems like ohio. I've got a list for this too. Slepts through one of the meetings they had. The assemblies were cool, but it was boring otherwise.  I'd like to go when I'm a junior. Looks cool. Back today. Bought Blue Moon. Gotta Love Laurell. Now I'ma head to bed. G'Night. I'll get them lists later.
