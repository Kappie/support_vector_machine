I walked out with a few phone numbers :P. Also, When they got up and played their last song, The CRAZIEST MOSH EVAR! Really. I ran into a friend there. This was our conversation:    ::I smack her arm, she turns around::  "Hey!"  "Hey!"  "What are you doing here" She said  "What do you think I'm doing here?"  "Haha Stupid Question.  I'll be right back."  ::She walks away.  5 minutes later she reappears::   ::We talk about how fucking awsome the show was::  Then she says "Well, i have to get back to my friends, and oh shit, my pants are falling down"  i say "Good to know," and we exchange new phone numbers. As she walks away,. she pulls her pants down the rest of the way, flashes me a beautiful thong on a perfect ass, and walks away.     It was right then I fell over.  Maybe it was the ass, maybe it was the beer I stepped in.  Who knows.    Also, tonight I went out and saw the Bourne supremacy. Awsome movie, a great fight scene, but the chase wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It left story gaps for a 3rd movie. I so would have rather seen Napoleon Dynamite again, which by the way is the FUNNIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.   And Jeremy....I know...  But a guy can dream, right?  Plus all the horney bastards that actually read my blog LOL.   Anyways.....yeah.
