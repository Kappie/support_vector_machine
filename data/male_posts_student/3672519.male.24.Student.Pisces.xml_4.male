So I am now 24 years old and counting, and I've decided on an online record of hopefully the remaining 2/3's of my life.  I'm now studying at the National University of Singapore, and going into my final year. I live comfortably with a great family consisting of 2 sisters, 1 mother and 1 father.   I have 2 border collies called Lance and Gawain, who are, respectively, father and son. I have a long-neck turtle who has survived negligent bouts of starvation, disease, and cannibalism (I used to have two).   I have what everyone else has, almost. Hmmm. It really is the beginning after all.
