Based on Horror Movie template from blogskins.com with pictures from Miz Graphics. This template took almost two hours to complete with debugging, previewing (multiple times), and finding pictures.   Where's my formattings had gone? Well, the CSS file is missing. That's why. I'll fix it at once. Sorry for the inconvenience.
