       
      I've caved. I decided to throw my hat into the ring. Here is my addition to the 4 billion (or so) webpages out there. I'd like to say that I've got lots of important burning issues to tackle or something, but really, it's just self-indulgence (as Leavy so finely put it). And it's summer in St. Louis, so I need something to do with my time.
