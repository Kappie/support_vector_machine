I'll list.  1) Strength and conditioning: I'm working out 2 hours everyday at Jesuit's EXCELLENT weight room and track. And what's weird, or at least unexpected, is that I'm having fun, too! Granted, I lift a little more than a gnat and bench a little more than a mosquito, but I'm working on that side of it. I eat twice my weight in meat everyday to fuel such a venture.  2) Driver's ed: that's right, the Squirrel will be on the road shortly! Fear. Anyways, my driver's ed instructor is frickin' hysterical. For instance, today's lesson was Lesson Four: How To Die, and the Exciting Lives of Dead Kids. Friggin' awesome, man. We'll watch those sappy videos and laugh at the stupid kids who die because of stupid decisions. It's like one long Darwin Awards. I know that some of the kids were honestly killed because of other people's dumb decisions, but mostly... they're dumb. Drink and drive, j00 die. Get in the car with someone who's been drinking, j00 die. Race other cars in your  4 cylinder Camry because of testosterone poisoning, j00 die. I'm half offended, and half really really amused. It's a fun thing.  3) Awesome movies and ice cream: Jenny, David, a rotating cast of other fun people, and I have been frequenting this dollar theatre a lot, and there's of course more planned, all across the metroplex. They're the most fun, really. And Jenny, I'm so sorry about your broken foot! I doubt it'll be amputated, really. And if so, you're still off the charts, as far as your Supercool ranking goes.  4) NEW JOB! I'm working with David (Fry) at Voyager Expanded Learning, which is awesome. First of all, it pays 8 bucks an hour. Second of all, all I have to do is random office-monkey type things, and data entry with Excel. Third of all, it's for one of the best and coolest causes: teaching kids to read! I feel like a cog in a benign (rather than Terminator-esque) machine. A well-paid cog!  5) Clark's running an Eberron campaign, so I'm stoked for that. New world, new heroes, new villains, new -adventure-!  6) New threads. You know, I never actually call them threads.  I'm out.  Oh--!!! 7) DSL! Delicious. So very very fast.
