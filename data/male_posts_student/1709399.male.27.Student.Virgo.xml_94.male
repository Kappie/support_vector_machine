I knew the song was extremely popular and of course the movie was one of Hitchcocks's classics.                                   However I read this phrase in Todays newspaper and did some googling to find out what it means .  Que sera sera means "Whatever will be will be " . Probably the apparent reference is to a more Philosophical  fatalistic view of the future .
