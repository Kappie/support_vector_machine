They think that they can get their fencers to go than that's ok.We'll just have to prove ourselves some other way. My team doesn't seem to care sometimes. Their are also rumors that Davidson might not fence for Benedicts anymore. That would be so great. All I have to do is get past Tracey and the rest of the A Strips(kopylov,Conley,Chu,Hammond,etc.). It kills me sometimes when I know it's my last year and I haven't made a name for myself. Mason said I'd be a household name.I don't wanna be like Tambor or Rivella. I don't want to get in to the spotlight and then lose the big bout or get injured halfway through the season. I want to accomplish my dream. I want to be captain of the first Columbia team to win 3 state championships in a row. I want to graduate from Columbia with that ring on my finger. I want the Coaches to watch me fence and offer slots on their college teams. I want Pete and Mustilli to help me get into any school.ugh there's so many things I need to accomplish with my fencing.
