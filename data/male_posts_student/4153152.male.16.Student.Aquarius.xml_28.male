That's how this whole server thing came about. I got this computer from a dark corner of my room, and thought: "I wonder if I could get a good Battlefield server running on this." The short answer: yes.  I started out on this yesterday afternoon. At 4AM today, I had a functioning (LAN) server. I have yet to see how it runs on the internet. In the process of all this, I installed some Linux programs (which I am very proud of doing) and changed the system from this AMD to an Intel processor, and then back again. I also learned the hard way Anime unleashed is the only thing on TV after 2. And even then, that's only until 3. After that, paid programming as far as the eye can see. I checked Discovery, G4TechTV, History, Comedy Central, ABC, CBS, NBC, TLC, and Fox. On the upside, I could be making $50,000 a week, sell my timeshares for cash, lower my credit card debt, stop smoking overnight, and have a gigantic penis. I think that's an offer I can't afford to miss out on (refusing).  Another LAN today, and I have a groundbreaking idea! I'll be back tonight (or tomorrow morning) with my idea and all things informative from the LAN party.
