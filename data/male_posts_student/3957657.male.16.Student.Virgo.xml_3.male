Saw some girl at a store today with pink hair, made me miss MY pink hair :P BUT Taco Bell tends to frown upon pink hair.... I still need like 4 things before I can get that job, but I've pretty much got it...I hope. I reformatted my computer, so it runs better, but I lost all of my music :( I feel like I've done a good deed, I introduced someone to Atreyus wonderful music :) Hah, wow this is a boring boring boring post.....boring....WOAH WHAT A COOL DOG! be back later, I have to chase a dog down the street!
