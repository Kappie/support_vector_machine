I have been working on my forum for about a week now. We have a lot of members and we are starting to get a bit active. Hopefully more people will join and see it and stuff. There is a link on the side, I hope to see you guys there. I have now watched Bruce Almighty a total of four times. I love that movie. Anyways, that is all for now. I will talk to all of you guys later. Hope you are having fun decoding this. Bye.  Okay, well it didn't really work out. I didn't want to have to put spaces every couple of sentences. So just how I am feeling is in binary code. Maybe I will put it in hexidecimal later.
