I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life I got a ride all the way to paradise   -  urlLink Ticket to Heaven , by  urlLink Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler   The song might be too idealistic for some musical tastes, but nevertheless, has stunningly beautiful lyrics. Its even more beautifully composed, and when you complement this with Mark Knopfler's awesomely clean, laidback, and completely distortion free guitaring, it really is a ride to paradise.  The time was December 2002. As I look back with nostalgia, it has been the most smoothest musical ride of my life. My cousin  urlLink Bhushan , suggested I check out some of the Mark Knopfler solo albums -  urlLink Sailing to Philadelphia  and  urlLink Golden Heart . Bhush has a tremendous flair for music and is adept at playing keyboards as well as with programming and arranging music. I usually take his recommendations pretty seriously and we usually end up hitting the same note, so far as musical interests are concerned. Here at CSU,  urlLink Sid  was already familiar with MK and Straits, and thanks to him, I was initially able to check out some of their collection. It didn't take me long to get hooked onto Knopfler and Straits. I always loved the sound of the guitar, but then this was an entirely different sound, completely unheard of before.   The rest is history. Guitar soon became an intense obsession and I decided to take a beginner level instructional guitar class at CSU this Fall. With MK and Straits, inspiration and motivation came easily, and I picked an acoustic Alvarez guitar to start strumming away. My immediate goal was to learn the guitar in order to play some Dire Straits riff, forget the fact that I fortunately figured out very early that it takes atleast a year to play even the most easiest of songs with the slightest of clinical precision. The obvious difficult part was putting inspiration and motivation into practice. And thus I began the frustrating journey, perhaps none more frustrating than learning a string instrument like the guitar; where fingers hurt and cramp, words such as  inspiration  and  motivation  become a thing of the past and are replaced by words like  loss of interest  and  utter boredom . It is easy to put down a guitar after 10 minutes of frantic fret-play. Another phrase that I take credit for coining. You begin to wonder if the entire process is worth going through. However, to quote MK's lines from  urlLink The Bug  -  "Its a strange old game you learn it slow..."  - given your continous zest and passion, you will eventually find the process worth it. And what better than to actually be able to play the songs of the band that became the very reason you took this ride! I can say with atleast some degree of self-satisfaction that I was able to play  urlLink Ticket to Heaven  in the last couple of days. One thing's for sure; at this stage  playing  is rather a glorified word for  scratching , but I know I'll get there one day.  I am still unqualified to dedicate an entire blog to discuss my own guitaring in detail. So let us leave this for another day, a day when I can probably boast of playing some more serious stuff. The section  My EADGBE  in the sidebar contains links to songs that I am playing on my guitar these days.  But it sure is high time I dedicated a blog to the guitar God who fuelled this passion in the first place. I have been guilty of writing excessively long blogs in the past, and MK deserves an entire space to himself. Check the sequel to this blog  urlLink here .
