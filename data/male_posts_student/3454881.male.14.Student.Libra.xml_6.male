I think we should expand our energy resources to wind and/or solar energy. Wind is free. Wind is inevitable. It's a very "bright" idea to conserve natural resources and help our environment considerably. We need to push our congressmen and woman to make our state cleaner. Here's a fact for ya; we waste about 60 million dollars on coal and that coal pollutes our rivers and lakes with some mercury. We need to take affirmative action, NOW!
