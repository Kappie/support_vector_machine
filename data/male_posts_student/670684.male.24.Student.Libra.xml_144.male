As I mentioned before, there was a  urlLink campus walkout yesterday  that marched from the South Mall to The Drag, blocking traffic between 22nd and 27th streets on Guadalupe.  It was the most amazing sign of activism I've been privvy to, and while I had company in town who feels George Bush is doing the right thing, I was still able to spend 20-30 minutes with the protest.  A  urlLink more personal  account is here.  There are bad sides to protest as well...and Austin's had its share over the past 48 hours.  A UT Student was  urlLink bruised after an altercation  with UTPD officers...definition of "altercation" differs between both accounts.  And after a round of peaceful protests, a discrepancy in what to do with the night protesters left 30 arrested and many more suffering the effects of  urlLink pepper spray .  By the way, that photo essay from the last link is probably the best I've seen in a long time.
