Cyber sex is not the healthiest thing, having sex with someone you never ever saw, it would like being  raped for someone that can't even touch you .....   Kinda wierd!      It's the last month of "Sex in the city", do you guys think that wether i send an e-mail to the director of it, saying that it can't just end,   they will keep it on?
