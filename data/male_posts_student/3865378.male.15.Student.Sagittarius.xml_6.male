Here's a review I prepared while viewing the matches:   Bad Blood   June 13th 2004   Nationwide Arena, Columbus, OH   Bad Blood was spilt all over when two rivals busted each other in a Hell In A Cell and a champion himself had to become a monster to surpass the monster.  The 1st match was for the   World Tag Team Championship    Champions  La Résistance vs. Chris Benoit and Edge   This was a rematch granted by Eric Bischoff on the last episode of RAW, but you would see (even the announcers mentioned it) Edge fighting and being more involved in the match more than Benoit. Whether that was to rest himself before facing Kane later that evening remains to be seen. La Rez proved that they could defend their new World Tag Team titles against the team they defeated to win them, but the challengers almost turned the tables as Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Sylvain Grenier and Edge speared Rob Conway to throw him out of the ring.   Unbelievably, La Résistance kept their titles, but by disqualification, when Kane crashed the scene and attacked and chokeslammed Benoit and Edge.   Singles Match   Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko w/ Trish Stratus   This was a typical 'David vs. Goliath' situation. Speed against power. Tomko is a physically dominating athlete, and this match showed how powerful he was as he threw Y2J from one side of the ring to the other. The tables turned when Tomko accidentally knocked Trish off the ring apron and Jericho, seeing the opportunity, did a sort of dropkick / drop toe hold mix to get the 1-2-3.   Intercontinental Championship    Champion  Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin   Shelton completely dominated the match and blew Orton away. Everything that Randy could do, Shelton could do it better. The only reason he won was because of Ric Flair's dirty tactics and a handful of tights. Next time he won't be so lucky.   Women's Championship    Champion  Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus   This one was a very quick match, when Lita DDT'd Gail Kim the Champion seemed to be decided, if Trish didn't roll Lita all of a sudden to get the 3 count and to become the only 5-time Women's Champion.   Singles Match   Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   Eugene outsmarted and outwrestled the Coach, applying a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow just before the pinfall, Stunning Garrison Cade after the match, and after that Stunning the Coach. I tell you, this kid has future.   World Heavyweight Championship    Champion  Chris Benoit vs. Kane   As the Bad Blood introduction said, 'To slay the monster, the champion must himself become a monster; to become the champion, the monster must evolve into pure evil.' Kane just dominated physically in this match, as Benoit could hardly stand up. Miraculously, the Rabid Wolverine threw a wrench in the gears of the Big Red Machine. While trying to apply the Crossface to Kane, he powered out by standing up, but Benoit immediately went for the other arm, and while Kane's knees fell, he turned around and pinned him with a half Nelson - cradle mix. And as he said while being interviewed by Todd Grisham after the match, he sure is for real!   Hell In A Cell   Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   After years of clashes and rivalry, it escalated to this. When I saw this match, I thought anyone could win. But then again, the announcers did a good job by saying that Hell In A Cell produces not winners nor losers, but survivors. These two went at it for 47 minutes and 26 minutes, with chairs, tables, ladders, and the cell itself. The most famous rivalry in the history of the WWE ended with two straight Pedigrees. HBK and Triple H gave it their all and then some, so much that Evolution had to carry The Game out of the ring. Shawn got up a few minutes later, receiving a wild ovation. Good work Shawn.  And that's my review. Hope you enjoyed it.
