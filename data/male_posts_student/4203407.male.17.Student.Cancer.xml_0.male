I mean, the '2' on my mobile phone broke, and my courtesy mobile has been blacklisted; BT has been really out of sorts, possibly because he has a hairball lodged in his throat; and Ed's away, but I'm feeling rather emotionally sprightly. I've been tidying my room up a bit, coming up with big plans for OddBlog.  I had some weird dreams this morning, but I can't think what they are. Some probably had to do with next year and what it'll be like. Actually, the night before last I got into two massive MSN convos - you know the ones, where some bone-head (usually Ben) invites hoardes of peeps who you don't know for some kind of nerdy kick. In the second one I met a couple of gays from the West Country/Wales, so I kind of got into that mood - with people from school like Ben and Dave still in the convo. I think next year I'm definitely going to be outed.
