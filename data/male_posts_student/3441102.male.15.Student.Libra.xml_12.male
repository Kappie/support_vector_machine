The bartender is experienced and has learned not to ask people about the animals that they bring into the bar, so he doesn't mention the ducks. He and the man chat for about half an hour before the guy with the ducks has to go to the toilet. The ducks are left on the bar. The bartender is alone with the ducks. There is an awkward silence and so the bartender decides to try to make some conversation. What's your name?' he asks the first duck. Huey, replies the first duck. How's your day been, Huey? Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. Oh. That's nice, says the bartender. The bartender then turns to the second duck and says: Hi. And what's your name?. Dewey, came the reply. So how's your day been, Dewey? Just wonderful. Fantastic day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. If I could have another day just like today, I would do the same again. The bartender turns to the third duck and says: So, you must be Louie. No, growls the third duck. My name is Puddles. And don't ask about my day.
