Yeah.. I can agree with that.. She also include that we can be together after the 'O's. She even told me that her friends comes first. Can you believe that. It's between me and her and nothing to do with her friends.. It doesn't matter to me then.. We were on time-out.. Then this realtionship between Jenni and me started to fade.. She stops sms-ing me and seldomly get in contact. She wouldn't reply my smses anymore. And when we're online.. She always reply late.. Sometimes never at all.. I don't understand why she reacts this way man.. At first I thought she was the one. But I guess I'm wrong. I didn't obeyed my parents just to go out with her man.. I made many sacrifices for her. When my phone's low in credit, I took my cash and top it up just to get to her..  But I'm ok if she never sms or reply me when we're online.. The one fact I couldn't take was that for these past few days, she totally ignored me!! When I said totally I mean it. Even we saw each other.. She never even gave me a smile.. Not even a "Hi!" when we were face to face.. I guess from that moment onwards.. She has no more feelings towards me.. I guess it's history now....
