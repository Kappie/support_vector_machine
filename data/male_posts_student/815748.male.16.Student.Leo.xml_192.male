Virtually all of what he said was either smart (most of it) or at least correct, if a little vague.  The only thing that I didn't like was this: "I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation - not the Saudi royal family."  We may rely on Saudi oil too much, but we shouldn't alienate our allies, especially in an unstable region and ones who have begun to crack down on Islamist militants.  Even so, Mr Kerry deserves the presidency, especially considering the alternative.   urlLink     Oh yeah, I've begun following The Economist's style of using titles before last names.  It's more respectful.
