I'm sad to leave my camp friends, and what's more I'm wondering if I used my time here wisely.  In particular, I'm wondering whether my life was sufficiently different in their eyes to make them wonder  why  the life of a Christian is different from that of everyone else.  In english: did I act like a Christian this summer? And why should the Christian life be different?  A quote from the Apostle Paul:    "For we do not want you be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope." (2 Corinthians 1:8-10).   I love verses like that -- the ones that show that Christian strength is, to the naked eye, a fool's hope, like Frodo standing at the foot of Mount Doom (Christian geeks like them some LOTR references!).  But it's built on a victory that has already been won.  But.  It's so hard for me,  soooo hard , to believe that I have a hope that overcomes any and all despair that life might bring.  I know it in my mind, but I can't believe it in my heart.  Except...that I am starting to, slowly.  It is just so hard to communicate this to anyone else.  Life never got so hard this summer that my faith stuck out as different from or stronger than my friends' vague agnostic faiths in whatever.  Nor was my research so infused with the holy spirit that I mathematically unravelled the laws of physics in a fascinating and elegant superproject and I didn't, as I originally hoped, come up with any lovely musings on the  mathematical beauty of God's creation.  Mostly, my summer project is sucking as much as, if not more than, everyone else's.  So where has my life been different?  Maybe,  hopefully  in the little things.
