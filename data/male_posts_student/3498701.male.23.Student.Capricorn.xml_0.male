I am feeling the strain on my head and the sinking sensation in my chest. I have been trying to solve endless chains of equations to no avail. At one instance, i felt like "John Nash" writing maths solutions on the window. That thought spurred me on a bit last night before the motivation flickered with each stumbling block i encountered.   I woke up today wanting to see my supervisor. One thing is weird though. Some clashing emotions (or should i say intentions) brewing inside me. On one hand, i know that i need to see him desperately to seek enlightenment, on the other hand, i am reluctant to see him due to the fact that i have been a notorious student of his who disregard the importance of doing serious work early. Long story on the later. I just made up my mind, after typing the last three sentences, that i have to see him today no matter what. I guess i have to get ready and rush to uni to work things out.   To end today's posting, I know I should not be stressed and worried. Panic is out of question if I have faith in HIM. Being stressed and panicky is just a show of distrust to His promise.  I would like to end with these verses from the bible.   Mat 6:25  Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?  Mat 6:26  Behold the birds of the air; for they sow not, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them; are you not much better than they are?  Mat 6:27  Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?  Mat 6:28  And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, nor do they spin,  Mat 6:29  but I say to you that even Solomon in his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  Mat 6:30  Therefore if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much rather clothe you, little-faiths?  Mat 6:31  Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?  Mat 6:32  For the nations seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.  Mat 6:33  But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.  Mat 6:34  Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow; for tomorrow shall be anxious for its own things. Sufficient to the day is the evil of it.   Mat 7:7  Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.  Mat 7:8  For each one who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.  Mat 7:9  Or what man is there of you, if his son asks a loaf, will he give him a stone?  Mat 7:10  Or if he asks a fish, will he give him a snake?  Mat 7:11  If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him?   To readers out there, God loves us.  My panic has avaporated. I am soothed.  Hopefully my next posting will be a happier one.
