Unfortunately, thanks to my cold-hearted friend Trevor, he got the Presidents of the United States of America song "Peaches" stuck in my head. Now don't get me wrong, I love PUSA, and songs like "Lump" and "Kick Out the Jams," but this song Peaches is SO FRIGGIN' ADDICTING! For about 4 or 5 days now I've been thinking about it like nuts! I mean, how cool is this song. I mean, take a song about fruits and IT'S GOOD! That's hard, my friend, but they made it happen! So all's I gotta say is, go to the country and get yourself some peaches.  Keep it fo-shizzle like Bobby D-izzle!
