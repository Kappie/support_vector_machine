I honestly don't like them, and think they are a bad idea, but instead of being the typical teen that only embraces change on their part, I tried to look at things slightly more objectively.  That's what I do after all.  In the short-term, I hate them.  They are a change from my already fine routine, to combat something that I'm unfamiliar with.  Then again, if one really looks at it properly, they'll realize they aren't going to go away, and most teachers will stop being so anal over them.  They'll get sick of complaining about this, just like they are sick of complaining about hats.  Whatever.  It's bad, but only because it's something new coming from someone we generally are diametrically (always wanted to use that) opposed to.  I had an interesting dream, from maybe 5:30 AM- 6:50AM this morning.  After I woke up from the repeated swim team wake up times from my alarm clock, I fell into a semi-shallow sleep.  I generally dream my strongest dreams in this semi-shallow form of sleep.  I'm a strong believer that dreams tell us something, I used to think they were something else speaking to us, but then I realized how deep a persons mind can actually get.  My dream, this time, is easy to explain here because it highlights a common fear among people.  I hate, knowing that I'm trapped for a certain amount of time to an obligation I brought upon myself, as well as the anxiousness that comes out of that.    Anyway, on to the dream.  My dream was that it was late June, and I had gone to camp early this year (I suddenly remember having numerous camp dreams, but none as strong as this since this one can bring back memories of other dreams).  It's already starting to fade, but I went to camp and no one had went.  Not even Nia.  No girls were their, except the ones who no one cares about.  Kevin was my councilor (my favorite one) and he was like "Guys, this really sucks." and it was just like me and Adam S.  Needless to say that made me depressed and made me feel trapped.  Suddenly, I was pulled out of camp because I needed to finish my final exams, which I missed by being at camp.  It gave me a feeling of regret, of needing to go back to camp (just remember another camp dream), but also a feeling of happiness to have escaped from the three weeks of being utterly bored.    Thinking about that more, it reflects a few things.  I felt this way through most of the camp session last summer.  I dwelled on the fact that most of the girls I wanted to talk to weren't there (except Sonya if she reads this) and a lot of the thrill from before was gone (I didn't sneak into a cabin once that year, besides that time we pretended to be terrorist...).  This was magnified a x100 in my dream, to the point where I see it as a fear of hating my obligations I can't back out of, and the anxiousness for stuff to just end.  The feeling I'd want to throw away 3 weeks of my life, so I could go back to doing nothing.  This suddenly brings up images of the Easter Play at church, except the emotion is more muted, and I believe that the emotion was trying to come forward in this dream.  Hmmm... I really shouldn't interpret my dreams where everyone can just read them.... oh well.
