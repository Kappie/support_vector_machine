     
      It's Wednesday. I have a headache. I have a piano lesson at 3. Am I going to go in for it? Doubtful.  Two exams yesterday: Music and German Listening. I made a few obvious mistakes, stupidly, but as a whole I think I did okay. Bring on the English Lit. is what I definitely do not say. So at the moment, I'm feeling relatively mellow and I have my DVDs to comfort me for the rest of the day. Oh, and Rise of the Middle Kingdom, of course, with its cool chineseness.  Anyroad, have a lovely day, peoples, Scott.
