Some professionals have tendencies to leave part of the truth out, also known as fibbing, or just plain old lying! That doesn’t seem very honest to me, how about you?  Not only patients, but usually everyone wants to know all the facts when a particular subject involves them. When a possible potential problem occurs by a professional, but they don’t want to take the responsibility or want anything to do with the occurrence except look for an outlet to pass the troubles.  I’m not saying that mishaps never occur, but what happened to the good old days when people would admit when they were wrong, and not look to pass the blame to another source.  Ethical decision-making is not the problem; the problem becomes who has first-class quality ethics and who doesn’t. I do believe that we as future administrators hold the key to success, and can overlay the road to an enhanced generation.   Like we have always heard before “it’s easier said then done”, but we are the ones who can do it.
