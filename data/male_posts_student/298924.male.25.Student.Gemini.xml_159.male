Right now everyone to be honest....well The Ravens looked terrible and the Steelers looked subpar....and well the Bengals apparently are still the Bengals....  Today I want to talk about the person sitting directly next to me in the computer lab....Miss J. A.....she has started what we haved decided to call "football lessons"....in her purse as we speak she has a cheat sheet telling her all of the positions at any given time....she sat down this weekend and watched the NFL Sunday Ticket at the homie Dave's crib....  This is commendable on so many levels....more women should do this....by the end of the year J.A. will be able to discuss football on an intermediate level which immediately thrusts her into the upper echelon of women in America....along with my favorite lady right now and the venerable Charlie Cole (also known as the "Black Something about Mary")....  Anyway.....who is winning the super bowl you ask?....well I made a prediction on  urlLink OJ's message board in the Sports section (the thread entitled 'The NBA is cool but umm.....'   I'm not sure I want to make another prediction this soon....but for now I would like to say that Michael Vick has elevated his status in my eyes....and I already held him in high esteem....the man WILL be a Hall of Famer barring injury....  coming tomorrow some type of acknowledgement of Sept. 11....
