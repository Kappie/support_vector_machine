The webs between our fingers and toes have almost grown back as a result. A scan of the skyline to the west made me think that it might actually be raining a bit out toward the coast. All of this is a welcome change given the heightened awareness of fire hazard in the area. Most of the fields have been cut and bailed but it would be a shame if the hay got wet – yeah, I know, they use machines to move those bails around these days but, still…   For the locals: the intersection of highways 6 and 47 at Banks is all torn up. Expect about ¼ of a mile of loose gravel. We weren’t expecting it.
