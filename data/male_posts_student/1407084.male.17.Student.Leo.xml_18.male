Fixed for 99 cents.   now i will tell you what i've done for you 50 thousand tears i've cried screaming deceiving and bleeding for you and you still won't hear me don't want your hand this time i'll save myself maybe i'll wake up for once not tormented daily defeated by you just when i thought i'd reached the bottom i'm dying again  i'm going under drowning in you i'm falling forever i've got to break through i'm going under  blurring and stirring the truth and the lies so i don't know what's real and what's not always confusing the thoughts in my head so i can't trust myself anymore i'm dying again  i'm going under drowning in you i'm falling forever i've got to break through  so go on and scream scream at me i'm so far away i won't be broken again i've got to breathe i can't keep going under   (Evanescence - "Going Under")
