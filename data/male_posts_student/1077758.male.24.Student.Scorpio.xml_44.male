Needless to say, this did not sit well...considering that I got a C in the class, which is enough to make sure I go back in the fall.  Not to mention the admonition, "You can write better than this, Jason." Oh, hi. I'm Jarrod.  I  wrote the paper, kthxbi.  Jesus. But at least the 5 years that had been taken from my life have been added back to my sum total of...uh, 32, probably.  At least I won't have to worry about middle aged crises, although a little red sports car would always be nice.  And on the column to the left, I've added a link to Sherry's blog. I'm sure she'll appreciate that, heh heh.
