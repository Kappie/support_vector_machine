To simplify the text, the names of items you click... appear in  bold type .  Database identifiers appear in uppercase type."  I'm  confused .  I understand what  bold type  means because they  bolded  it.  But what in the world does "uppercase" mean??  I'm so confused.  Help me, Westlaw.  I'm only a law student!  The guide is 23 pages of complete nonsense about how in order to search for attorneys in Texas, you must type   Texas  in box marked "state search."  Thanks.  This is a silly waste of paper.
