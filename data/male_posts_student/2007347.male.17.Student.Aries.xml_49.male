My lectures weren't even like real lectures and i hardly saw any of the people i expected to see and stuff. Damn! It failed. But i posted the photos anyway under Tuesday Gallery. So you can look at them, but I'll have to do another, and better one later.   PhotoLog: That is, to document a day's events in photographs.  Anyway, I've decided that although aspects of my life need improvment, I am happy. Strange, I didn't think I'd knock that goal off so early...
