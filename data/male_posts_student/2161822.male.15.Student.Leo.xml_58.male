Check  urlLink Neötærik's site  for directions. Secondly, tomorrow signifies one day until PJAS. Which isn't a good thing. Since I was lazy and put off my project until today. I just learned my speech today, which I will forget by the end of the day, and I have to present tomorrow in front of classes. Great. Just great. Sunday will be great. But now, it's just horrible. This week sucked. I was workin on stuff all week and memorizing and attempting to understand equations. I need to relax man. Chill outtt. But anyway, what happened today worth mentioning. Nothing really. School was boring like usual. History was especially long. Somehow I managed to fall asleep 3 times in 3 different positions during that period. And it's Lent. How about that. I wonder who will break their Lenten "promise" first. Why do these blogs take me so long to write. I've been sitting here, drinking gatorade, spinning in my spinny chair, and listening to music for about 20 minutes thinking of what to write. Maybe if I was writing something people read, but it's just my blog. And my blog = waste of time. But at least it keeps me occupied.   Mr Peanut Bowl (7:31:03 PM): i was experimenting so i wrapped each of my fingers in different tape and the finger with electrical tape turned blue immediately  I'm glad our friend Neil is contributing his share to the world of science. And common sense. So another lesson from Neil, don't wrap tape around your fingers or anything else for that matter for you might by some crazy chance cut off circulation.  Listen to H.I.M.
