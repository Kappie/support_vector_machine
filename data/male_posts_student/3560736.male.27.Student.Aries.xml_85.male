A murdering tyrant has been brought to a court of law to face his accusers and respond to the atrocities he's committed. I hope that justice is indeed served, and by the look of things, that will most definitely be the case.   No matter where you stand on the why or wherefore of the war in Iraq, everyone should be glad that this man, this tyrant, has been brought to justice.
