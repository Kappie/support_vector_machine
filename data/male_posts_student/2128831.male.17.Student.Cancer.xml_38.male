I wish, I wish, I wish, I have the aloneness that does occur when you are the only one a a type to be there. It is quiet. Kind of lonely, but I will deal. I always do. I'm scared that I won't make any friends, but the fairy that lives in my hair or head or both keeps telling me how likeable I am. I'm sure I will find a friend. Yes, a gay one maybe, or or or or or a short, fat, jolly, black girl named Jooplika, perhaps. Haha, or Frankwich a male yeah, he would be a jolly fat asian dude with odd shoes.  School rocks my socks.com.  I am in Anatomy/Physiology (I am disecting minks, hahaha!  I took it's eye out), Algrebra II (Blah! A review slack course), Chemistry (It's easy here, it is, it is), and Foriegn Foods (We cook consently!  Wootwoot!) So it is okay, only I need a date for Winterfest.... Any takers?  Lol, maybe Jon if Jeron can't, then there is TIM my bestiest friend!  Hmmm, well we will see Lata' gata'.  I really do miss Jared, I hope he is okay.  VA is quite, my ex has moved on, he is over me like that.
