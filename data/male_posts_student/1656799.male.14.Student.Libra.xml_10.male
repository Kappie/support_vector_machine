Everyone changes a lot in there lives, and I think changes usually take place when new ideas circulate around one's head for a long time.  For a while I've been urging myself to go out and buy a decent book with plenty of pages to use for a journal. After I bought a book for the sole use of writing ideas for songs, I felt compelled to write varied ideas in there, slowly falling away from my music and lyrics, and probably heading towards a journal. I've managed to fight off this resistance, but I don't want to give in (as I know I will soon), so I've decided to go and buy myself a journal as soon as possible.  I'm considering changing this blog around as well, adding a proper description to go with a title change (the Hollow Wishes, feels quite, hollow if you ask me), and if you're the lucky ones I may update this often enough, although that itself is a hard task, I do not maintain an interesting life as others so brillantly do.  This was a short post, but was only supposed to let you know I am still alive and breathing, and that I plan to do some more in the future.  Toodles.
