I've never seen so many people show up for early prayer... and the services were so awesome because of it.      This week, I've been given a vision for my life. You see, the speaker gave some statistics about Christians, and one of them was that 95% of all Christians will never lead someone to Christ. That really bugged me, because I've never led anyone to Christ. So then, I was just praying the whole week for God to use me to lead others to Him. Then last night (Thursday), when I was praying, I was just asking God all of this stuff, like to give me courage and boldness, and a bunch of other things, and the worship leader came and prayed with me and prayed all of the same stuff that I was praying before!!! It was the most awesome thing ever! Then later in the night, a girl came and was praying for me, and she was just praying for more boldness and courage, and a couple of other things... but it all lined up with what I was praying for!    Anyways, camp was really good, but I'm glad to be home! I've been so exhausted, and I want to go to bed now (in my own bed)... anyways, I'm back, and I like bacon. Goodbye my friends.
