I was the main lagger as my connection was not at its best. It has been like this for the past week... when will it get back to its usual peak performance is still a mystery.  Had several wins, but i lagged out of 1 game, and lost a few, i think only 1 game or 2. They kept choosing Meta Mine when i hated it, and Lard Ass wanted to kick me out because i lagged too badly. I feel that i have improved vastly, but i will not rest on my laurels.  Aiming for Metal Axe by Tuesday. But next week marks the start of the HOMEWORK RUSH.   Will work on my blog if i have the time. Cya... hoping to find a UNIQUE tag board.
