He had a massive heart attack today morning and is now in Life Support systems. I was supposed to go to Pondicherry today to visit the Aurobindo ashram  Auroville but had to cancel the visit because of the heart attack to my thatha.                                          As per my current plans , I would be leaving Chennai on Tuesday night (By Train) and reaching Delhi on Thursday morning. But all this depends on how the next 24 hours turn out to be.
