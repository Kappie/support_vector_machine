The other day, I would not let Anything come in my way and pushed some aside for there was something planned that would include me, whether I end up crying on my way or breaking some . . .  Now, a thought of the past has come. Of all that I've done and tried in hopes that this works out with us and that I love ya. . .And am glad that you seem the same. For I realised that I'm almost bound to do anything for you, well. . .depending on what it is^_~
