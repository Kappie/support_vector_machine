There's no possible way to actually follow our professor half the time, so I just sit back and play around on my laptop.  I know, I know, I should pay more attention, but you'd be the same if you were here ;)  We didn't do too much in anatomy or neuro either.  Though, I was just studying over the integumentary system for the past several hours.  Hrm, I'm not too sure if I've mentioned this, but I've been working with one of my professors and 2 of my classmates wiring up all the labs and prof's offices throughout the school with DSL.  It's a huge project, and we've made quite a bit of progress in just a few days.  We're almost done completely wiring up the administration building, and were wiring up the anatomy and histology labs today.  It's actually quite a bit of work, as we were running wires in the ceilings.  Fun times, and we are getting paid after all. :)  On another note, I can't believe that it's almost graduation :(  It really sucks that I can't be there.  That's life I guess.  That's all for my ramblings today.  Bye bye.
