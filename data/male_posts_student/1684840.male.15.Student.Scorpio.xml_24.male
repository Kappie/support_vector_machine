I still don't think it has stuck in my head that school has finished, but I'm sure it will tomorrow when I won't have to get up at 7:30.  It almost seems that going on holiday isn't real either, more like a dream, but that's probably because it's so great :)  I'll post a bit later after I've sorted some clothes out and packed some stuff.
