So I'm enjoying my dinner at the seafood mecca Red Lobster and Mom comments on Josh's grooming and that he needs to start shaving (see prior post on my bitching about Josh... but don't they just grow up so fast?) and I tell him he can have my current electric one because it no longer works for me that well and I want a traditional manual blade and "shaving product" method. Closer shave that way, you know; plus there is some exfoliation something involved... I just pick this up from your friendly hunky-grooming-guru Kyan Douglas. If you don't know who he is then shame on you. So Mom makes a comment along the lines of "Really? Has you boyfriend been complaining?". What!? Is she crazy? Why would she even think I'm dating someone? I've told her I'm not before when she brings this up. I don't leave the house hardly ever now that school's out, and certainly not on Fridays or Saturdays. I don't get phone calls from people and go to my room and talk to them for long periods of time. Plus, she's so on a need-to-know basis. She doesn't tell me who she's dating (if anyone) right off the bat, so why should I. Sure I'm her kid and under 18, but she could be a little less controlling about my personal life. There's a bad story about that I'd rather not get into right now, or possibly never on this blog... feel free to talk with me if you're dying to know. Not to say I don't  want  a boyfriend.. God knows I do, to the point that I get all mopey when I perseverate on it. Hence my signing up for Gay.com in the slight chance some cute boys are on there that feel like talking to me or I actually get the balls to talk to. In any even it was one of those out-of-the-blue and random things my Mom does. Love her for it most of the time (she broke out into singing Barbara earlier), but some times its way to random and just makes me realize how sad I  am  can be.
