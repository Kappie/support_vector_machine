School still indeed sucks despite what some of you were thinking. Summer is still too far away. And so is my permit. Plus the whole blogger.com site has a new format so I am a little confused. Me being in my infinite knowledge and superior problem solving have come to the conclusion that I cannot handle anything more complicated than eating a sandwich. Anything beyond this difficulty causes severe brain damage and also physical damage to innocent bystanders. A sad realization I have no power over. Alright anyway. Cheese is good. Mmmm...sharp chedder. Indulge myself in little bite size chunks of heaven. And I have macaroni and cheese cooking right now. Noodles = good + Cheese = also good all = a bowl of tasty goodness.      So I'm sitting here playing my guitar and jammin to Led Zepplin. I've been basically learning Stairway to Heaven so I can play when we jam sometime in the near future. Cool song to play. Pretty easy too. Just what I like. And here you go. I hope this works.
