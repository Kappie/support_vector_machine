Social justice, human dignity, quality of life, empowerment, opportunity.  All these terms are so connected and intertwined. It seems like you can't have one without the other.  But how can these discrepancies be acknowledged when those with so little in all these qualities are ignored? How can they be given voices so that they become acknowledged?  It's heartening to see indivuals and organizations who have not given up on their kabayans, their kapatid, to lend them the strength of their voices, of their spirit, so that our brothers and sisters who are lacking are heard and recognized.  Much has to be done until we are all equal, until we all share the same human dignity, till we are all empowered and have the opportunities as human beings. It's hard to start the walk towards freedom when the end of the road is so far off but the journey must be started even with just a simple footstep forward.  Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed, it helps to read the quotes of Cesar Chavez. His words are so honest and simple, yet so strong and dignified that you can't help but feel inspired to carry on.
