The Wind Waker -Onimusha 3: Demon Siege -Resident Evil Outbreak -Onimusha Blade Warriors  -Max Payne 2: The Fall Of Max Payne   -Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball  -Project Gotham Racing 2 -Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles -DDR -DDR Konamix -DDR Disney mix -DDR Ultra Mix  The ones I highlighted in are the ones I might buy for him. Only one not all…  I’m leaning towards an Xbox Game
