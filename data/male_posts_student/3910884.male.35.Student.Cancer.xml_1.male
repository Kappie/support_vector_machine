However not everyone in the Philippines speaks English let alone reads English. As a matter of fact, many of the remote populations don't even read their local dialect.     Government Borrowing:     Philippines borrowed almost $80 billion from the World Bank. 40% of the current Philippine budget goes to paying off what is owed on the loan. It's no wonder that very little in terms of resources are funnelled to social services in the Philippines since most of the budget goes to the military and road infrastructure.
