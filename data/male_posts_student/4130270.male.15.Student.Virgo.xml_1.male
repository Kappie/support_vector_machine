Well anyway It has just sunk in that 3 of my friends are moving to different states this year. One of my friends is moving to California another is moving to Arizona and yet another is going to Texas. I am going to miss them all it is very sad. Two of them were on the forensics team with me and both did CX for at least Part of the year.  I went camping last night and realized that even nowadays when plp "Rough it" they not only have indoor plumbing but a lot of them bring their house(RV's). Over 3/4 of there "campers" were in RV's. I mean why go camping if your going to bring a house and all of its comforts with you... Come on plp.   Later,
