And when someone talk behind their back, they act as though they did not talk behind that person's back. There's this person I know who does this. He's this irritating guy that does not know when to ask the appropriate question. He thinks that only people can owe him things, but he cannot owe people things. He can lie to you and still say he is testing you. If you are this specific person, and you are reading this, I know you will talk bad about me behind my back more. I just don't want to put down your name down here, as I am not like you. You think that you are great, but in fact, you are not. Someday, you will be very disappointed in yourself. You are just a coward. If you want to insult, or disturb someone, just do it in front of him. If you do it behind his back, it only shows that you are one big coward. Don't think that I do not know what you are doing. I'm just keeping quiet.  Sometimes, human nature confuses me. Why do we make something bad look as though it is something good in front of our friends? I know this guy from my class, he thinks surfing pornographic material is something to be proud of. He just wants to be accepted into the group of people sitting around him. But, even the guy that he wants to befriend said, 'Surfing porn isn't something you should be proud of. It's bad.' But the guy that wants to be accepted continued bragging about the pornographic material. Porn is something bad. But it is something very addictive, just like drugs. It harms you, just like drugs. But it harms you spiritually and mentally. Unlike drugs which harm you physically. Porn contaminates your mind. It makes you lust after sex. When you view too much porn, all you can think of is sex, whenever you look a the opposite sex. It's bad and it harms your social life. When you cannot fulfil that lust for the opposite sex, that lust will change into lust of the similar sex or even the strong desire to do 'it' with animals. This is when porn really harms your life. I know of some people who are really willing to give up the habit of surfing porn, but they just can't. It's just to addictive for them. But, only God can help them....
