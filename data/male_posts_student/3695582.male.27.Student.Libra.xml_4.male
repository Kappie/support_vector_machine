Chalk that up not to staying out late, but spending an hour trying to get Real Player to connect so I could watch the Metro-Galaxy game in the wee hours of the morning.  What proxy connections worked previously for me suddenly decided they didn't want to anymore, the impasse ending with me installing the whole frigging program all over again, to watch a game that I'd already (accidentally) seen the score of.    Talked to Dan R of  urlLink Metrofanatic  this morning about, among other things, the serial lack of perspective of Metro supporters, even in victory. Let's recap: last night the Metrostars went on the road and put together one of the most complete performances of the season, if not of the last couple years.  Amado Guevara, always tenacious and soulful in his play, showed an all-too-seldom-seen glimpse of his offensive potential with his laser beam of a first goal.  Not that he shoots enough for my taste anyway, but too often Amado's shots are still rising as they hit the stands around Row Q; this time he lashed it past a helpless Kevin Hartman.  And Eddie Gaven....well what can you say?  urlLink  Two goals...two  brilliant  goals .  The second, curling and Bergkampesque, only off his left foot and in traffic.  He's 17 years old.  Frightening. But just because the Metro midfield ran the game and scored all three goals, is it really necessary to conclude that the forwards - Mike Magee and John Wolyniec - were at best ineffective, and at worst crap?  That's what happens in Metrofanland - never mind the fact that Gaven and Guevara couldn't have possibly moved as freely as they did if Magee and Woly weren't buzzing around, pressuring the ball and pulling a shamefully poor LA defense all over the place?  A small point, but one that exposes an unfortunate defect in the perspectives of some US soccer fans.  I don't feel any brighter after writing those five hundred words than I did when I began.  I may just not wake up today.  Now that the ABC/NBA "Let's Get It Started" ads have finally, mercifully disappeared from our lives (hopefully taking the Black Eyed Peas away with them), is there a more hideous and hatefully annoying ad than the Pepto-Bismol 'Hey, Pepto Bismol!' monstrosity?  And it's on  all  the time.  As soon as I become king, I'm going to take everyone involved from the ad agency involved with that one, staple them to the outside of a rocket by their nuts, and shoot it into the sun.  Oh dear god I've got to read 30 pages of phenomenonology this afternoon.
