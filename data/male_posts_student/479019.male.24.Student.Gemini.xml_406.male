I was basically in a trippy 18th century English estate. I was battling an evil warlock and I had friends all over the place in the place. One part that was kind of off was Laine winning some sort of Star Search thing on a TV that was in the place. Hah... Laine if you're reading this. I didn't know you can sing and dance like that! Anyway... eventually I made it out to the garden where I can to slash away with a sword at plants trying to grab me and wolves.   Earlier this week I had to battle a ghost. I was swinging a bad around violently.  I really think I can get my 690F paper and 603 papers done this week. I'll be going to campus to work on my papers later.  ***
