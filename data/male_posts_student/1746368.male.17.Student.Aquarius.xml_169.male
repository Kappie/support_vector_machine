They gave me a ride to Starbucks and I bought a Vente Strawberries and Creme Frapuccino. It was good but I was done with it within the hour.   As I was walking home, Patty and Danny (neighbors) saw me and they scared me...but it was ok, because I didn't have to walk more then a few minutes! I went over there and talked with Danny for a little bit. Apparently he's getting a job at Dairy Queen. I told him I'd bug him while he was working occasionally. I still want to get a job at Game Stop, but I think that it would be a bad idea with all that I am doing this summer.  Anyways, I got home and played a pretty cool stick figure RPG but I decided that it would be best if I didn't play it for way too long, or else I'd get addicted. Dominique called me up and said she and her little cousin (Joseph, 7) were going to the movies. So I took the fastest shower I ever have (less then 5 minutes I think), got dressed fast, grabbed my skateboard and headed out. We went to the Regal and saw Garfield. It was pretty corny, like I expected, but I think that I'm not going to go to the movies with a little kid anymore.   Anyways, that was pretty much my day. I'm sitting here eating popcorn and being kinda bored. Please leave a comment, all donations to the furtherment of the genius of Colin will be kindly accepteed; thank you.
