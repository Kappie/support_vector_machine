As you can guess, i am talking about  Age Of Mythology . Graphics are cool, they do not require a high-end pc or anything. It also has all that was cool from  Age Of Empire 2  and a bit of  Warcraft III  (Lucky me!).   So i speaked with  Gabriel  about the  N64  games for my bro. We also planned to go to the movies tonight. It also happen that i was later invited by  Wanderley  to go at the same time, i guess we will go as one group! Pretty cool, can't wait to be there. We have 2 movie choice :  Van Helsing  or  The Day After Tommorow .   Tommorow is gonna be  dungeon and dragon  at my house. Anyone tried  N1.02 ? Send a comment!  Regards,  Zephyr
