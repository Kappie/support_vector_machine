The main topic of most of my posts so far has, indeed, been the fact that I never update this damn thing. Why? Because that is the main, in fact, the only thing that ever happens here - a lack of updates. This isn't such a bad thing though; why the hell would anyone want to read about my pointless endeavors? My pathetic attempts at comedy? My problems? Or those of my cat, who so recently disappeared. SEE? ARGH!  Well, what have I been up to? GCSEs finished, but that's no great news, it happens to thousands of people every year - why should I be so special? In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't actually finished, but were lurking around street corners to get me. Next year its Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Ad-Maths. Argh. I'm going to die!  DIE!   Does anyone actually like statistics? I know I don't. Neither do my teachers. Except one. The statistics one, what a suprise. He deserves cleansing by fire in my humble opinion. The other day we were doing probability. Now, you may say... "Probability? Easy! Simple! No Problem!" Well... you'd be wrong. This probability was EVIL - Spawned from the sweaty depths of satan's underwear (and I don't mean his socks). Who ever heard of " 'A " meaning "Not A" and "A U D" meaning "A or D"? The "U" is supposed to stand for "Union"... Doesn't that mean both? ARGH! This was the easier bit. If I could explain the weird bits... That would mean I could understand them. Which I couldn't.  Finally, I would like to make a solemn promise to update this thing regularly. I have put nasty little reminders everywhere on my laptop, and set blogger to my other homepage - little chance of escape, I think.  P.S. I have a new email! - "dcmain(at)gmail.com" - so use that under the unlikely circumstance of actually wanting to contact me.
