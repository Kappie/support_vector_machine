Working 2:30PM to 10:30PM Monday to Friday is quite stressful and despite having the weekends and mornings off to do what I want, I seem to spend all of my time sleeping or working on my website.  It's a bit different for me to spend so much time at home without seeing my friends. I know that I am missing out on doing fun things but I also know that fun things cost money and I need every penny for next year.  Actually, as I look more into it, the trip is going to cost a lot more than I previously thought. I bought my $3300 dollar ticket earlier this week and got taxed $875. That combined with immunization costs, insurance, a two-month EuRail Pass, YHA Membership, visas and more leaves me almost broke before I even leave home. Don't get me wrong, I am not thinking even in the slightest about changing my plans, I just know that my year away is going to be more of a struggle than expected. Hey, look on the bright side; my blog is probably going to be much more entertaining for you guys to read! Who wants a story about a rich traveler who is sheltered in fancy hotels and restaurants the whole time and doesn't ever get to see the true colours of the places he is visiting?  As I look over my itinerary, I think more and more about how lucky I am to have the contacts I do around the world. My friends who were exchange students at my school are all great, interesting people and making friends with them has broadened my horizons, as I now know that even thousands of miles from home I have people who know me and can help me.  Felipe and Will, two Brazilian exchange students from my school, left for home a few days ago. I had known them since they arrived and decided to go see them off at the airport. The only problem was their flight left at 6.00 in the morning. I set my alarm and woke up at a quarter to 5. I wanted to go back to sleep so bad and I was sure that they would have plenty of other friends there to see them off, but I forced myself to go anyway. I drove down to the airport and met with them at their terminal. It turned out that I was the only local to see them off. As we exchanged details, Felipe pulled out a Brazilian soccer jersey and gave it to me. We said our goodbyes and I was so glad that I came. Not only did I get a great souvenir, I also made two lifelong friends with whom it might have been harder to stay in touch had I just gone back to sleep.   Tobi, Juan-Carlos and Luis are other good friends who I have had to say goodbye to recently. Although it is sad to part ways with them, it feels great to have the knowledge that I am going to see them next year and this time I can meet them on their own turf.
