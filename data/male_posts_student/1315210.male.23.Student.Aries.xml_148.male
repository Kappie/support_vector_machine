The Great Couch Potato Revolution is all about the wide spread and on going acceptance of the pple's acceptance of the greatest invention in history - the remote control.  i strongly believe in the many uses of the remote control......or rather having everything controlled remotely......y shld i even have to spend energy walking up to a tv set jus to turn up the volume jus a little bit more? y shld i have to get up to get a drink from the fridge? everything should be accomplished by merely a thought......accept certain things tho........sex and driving......and even then, viagra could be digitized and women's libidoes can also be remotely controlled.....the nites are gonna be longer but no longer cold and lonely........  but think abt it......arent we all heading that way? not the crazy sex thingy.....  yea, im just a lazy pig......but arent we all that way now?
