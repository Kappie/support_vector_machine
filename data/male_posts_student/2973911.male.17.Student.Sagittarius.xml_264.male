Well, maybe that's not completely true, because I received a message from you.  Still, please don't waste YOUR time texting anymore because I'm not reading anything on that cursed contraption again.  It's a load of wasted integrated circuits.    If you ask if I'm doing that coniotic "Friendster" social hooligan, of course I'd say no.  But the painful truth is, I do.  I hate myself.
