Others dedicated their social lives to pursuing a date with Abby.  Matthew Philbrook would often sojurn to the Canterbury House, speaking of the afternoon he just spent with Ms. McMurray, and how wonderfully things were going with his pining.    We all knew Matthew had no chance, and it had little to do with Matthew himself.  Abby was a girl with motive...she knew what she wanted and she knew how she would play to get it.  Yes, she went on a date with Bob Calhoun, Centenary's dwarven man-child.  But Bob was in Choir...Abby had no interest in sticking with Bob, but Bob fit into her schema of guys she'd date.     The Boys   1)  Choir. 2)  TKEs ( NOTE:  TKEs in the Choir were elevated to an deity status ) 3)  Other Greeks. 4)  Other.  And I never knew Abby McMurray to settle with the Others.    My crush lasted one day...Virgilio asked if he could draw a portrait of me for his senior art show.  He said it was a favor to him.  I was flattered.  Even though I wasn't the only one he was drawing that day, no one had ever expressed an artistic interest in me.  I sat as he drew Abby, who wore a periwinkle blue ball gown and some sort of gem-set necklace.  She looked beautiful...looking back I do ask why she would dress so fashionably for a charcoal drawing on blotting paper, but transfixation on her glorious breasts usurped any rational thought.    I knew too much about Abby's boy troubles, the drama she created around her...and it was created.  She had a long memory of guys gone and guys to come, and anyone who settled down next to her on one of the SUB swing benches to have an afternoon chat would learn about Chip, or any number of TKEs, and her disgust with boys.  Yet seeing her on any number of couches at the TKE house with any number of pot-smoking, GPA challenged frat boys, it felt both expected and wrong, and it seemed to feel wrong because every time I'd see her with a Todd Kileen, I wondered why it wasn't me instead.    Two weeks before I graduated, I found myself at yet another TKE party.  TKE parties were some of the best parties on campus, but they never offered anything more than the usual.  Jean Ancelet would stand in the bar, mixing the casual drink and holding the casual conversation, all the while wearing his trademark black hat with no insignia.  Sean Gilder would be outside, attempting to get the Ashley Daigles and Jennifer Maynards of the world to do the pole dance on him.  Will Wells would smoke pot in the back room.  Corey Pavletich would shake hands as he passed, pretending that he cared.    I was seated on a bit of deck bench when Abby McMurray bounced by, sat on my lap, put her arm around my neck and said  So when are we going to make out?   What's stopping us now, I asked.  She laughed and hugged me, and sat on my lap for the next twenty minutes, rubbing my shoulder and breathing on my neck.    This is where the game should have started, the game where I put on a fake charm, try to look like James Dean, and put as much kindly pressure on Abby to get her to back to my place for a night of high school romping.  But I didn't do it.  I stayed myself, remained flippant, whimsical, positive.  I would have loved to have made out with Abby McMurray that night.  But I didn't put forth the leg work to do it.  Because Abby wanted me to play the game.    Sitting on my lap, sticking her neck precariously close to my lips, maneuvering her hand across my back and my chest, yet never committing to any certain action.  Everything about my body carriage, my actions made it evident that I was interested.  But she needed the right language, the right moves, the dance that society tells us to do.    So I excused myself, shifted Abby off my lap, and went to talk to some other people.  I grabbed a beer, walked through the house, maybe danced with a few folks in the house, and made my way back out to Abby.  Because while I wasn't into the game, I was into her that night.  And I could see that she was interested in me...she didn't want to start a flowering relationship, but she was willing to put my name on her list of experiences if I was willing to play by her rules.  I wanted to see if maybe she found that I don't follow the rules.    Instead, I found her and Mark Simmons kissing.  Mark Simmons.    So I walked away, found Justin Kirkes, told him to get in the car, and we drove in silence to Longview, where I bought us Sourdough Jack combos and we talked about how girls suck.
