Looking back, a whole lot of it is just a that--a bunch of crap fabricated to aid me in my search for acceptance and happiness.   Sometimes I wonder, as well, how some people can be so social to other people and not me. There are a few certain people who do a lot of stuff that I do too, but none of them have ever taken the time to get to know me. You know who you are. Yes, you. mhm.
