An uncanny replica of a human. He destroyed it after he realized what he had done. Artistic perfection is an oxymoron.   Rage seethes through me. My heart pounds furiously at me, scowling. Blood boiling, I reach for the knife. Put it away. I want to scream. I can't wake everybody up. They're all so peaceful in their sleep. Perhaps they are the ones that are awake, And it is I in the nightmare. No, this is truth. It reeks of truth. Torpid stench. I scream. No answer. Rage eats me up inside. It feeds. It grows. It turns into hate. I kill every single one of them. I want to scream. Anger. I plunge it inside And I'm awake. No, no, no, I say Over And Over. Beaten path, it beats me.
