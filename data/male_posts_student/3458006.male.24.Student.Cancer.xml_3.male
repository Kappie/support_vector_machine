So this morning my boss detailed some testing that I should be carrying out. Which I have been doing untill now with no problems! Sweet. That was slightly unexpected on my part. As for memory effieciency (sp?), Im wasting about 1Kb which isnt bad but it isnt good either. Also, still have to do the report for college back home and, of course, study for my repeat exam. Sure, I'll be alright.  Ordered a 256Mb USB 2.0 stick from Komplett.de today also. Sweet. Hopefully it will arrive at the start of next week and then all the file transfering I have been strugling with will be a load easier. (What files I hear you ask... Well, mostly pics and that)
