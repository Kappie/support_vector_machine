Umm...you have known me for a very long time.  I have NEVER ever enjoyed watching soccer, hockey, basketball, baseball, football, and pretty much any other mainstream sport.  Unless someone I know and like is playing I do not enjoy watching sports.  I enjoy watching people I can identify with.  I don't identify with those sports.  If you want to take me to a classical symphony, awesome.  If you want to take me to an art gallery, great.  I even like watching extreme sports.  For some reason I identify with those athletes more than other athletes.  I love skateboarding, BMX biking, surfing, snowboarding, sky diving, etc.  People are always telling me I want to grow up to fast.  I like being young, I just want people I identify with.  Generally, they are older than me.  The age gap between me and "them" is lessening.  Hopefully, I don't die of boredom before I get there.
