I would like to mention the [smut] members and og members and other people who came to the meet yesterday, thanks for doing so. also, did anyone see that girl crying? i think it was my fault, cause i beat her like hardcore in the back... bigah, sore loser. the next meet is wednesday against kieo academy, its senior recognition day, and we want to go out by destroying those heartless people (actually, they are very intelligent and smart, but they are probably conjuring ways to take over the planet). So eveyone please come and stop the movement.   for some reason, when i thought of the kieo kids taking over the planet, it reminded me of that coheed song. "Apollo, what should i do next..."
