It’s a wonderful school were in debt! we decided to build a 2 million or so dollar bubble, when we had NO money!! since i was a freshmen last year, we had 3-4 bomb threats! i lost count now instead of getting us out, like any other school, hononegah said hey! lets move them to a possible safe but large area of the school! who cares about they’re safety! and those were the lucky times, usually we would keep going on with normal school because they didn’t think it was dangerous enough for us. a short time in the school year, all the teachers decided to go on strike! why? Payroll cuts? unsafe working area? nope. the teachers did not want the option to have the option to have one less hour, yes you heard me right, they had a optional one less prep period, they didn’t want that option, so there goes a 3 week strike! so it was fun, but, well we stayed in on our few breaks, and got a lot less summer break as well... now when there’s a fire alarm, no one knows what’s going on, I ask, they say uhh I dunno.  maybe school officials should know? so after the many other problems, it was near the end of the school year... we were out of money and in debt, we tried too pass a referendum to get some money, well no one wanted to pay a extra 5 cents on they’re taxes because they can almost buy gum, if they save up for a few months! So now parking is about $200.00 I think, drivers ed is about the same, everything will cost a lot as well.  the school also can not afford the power bill.. my school cut study hall and I get about 30 mins extra sleep! Well that’s all for this entry, talk to you later! wait, before i go... take a look at this... i think it looks like a jail! my school!
