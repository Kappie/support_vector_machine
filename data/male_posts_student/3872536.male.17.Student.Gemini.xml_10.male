Today's eclub camp rather interesting lor. At least the activities they planned are not too disgusting lol. I onli noe i had a hard time walking after turning 4 like 10 rounds lor. Ran into the wall... So shameful lol coz saw triple images. Haiz wat to do my eyesight got prob the lah.  But nevertheless, I enjoyed it lol.  They announced the B.O.D for eclub today and I actually got the chairperson post lol. Actually I knew it a wk b4 lor, but the teacher told mi not to reveal it so... Initially, I tot it's my own barrier tat I have to overcome but after the first meeting I realised it's not lor. Thr's realli a tough route ahead lor. I'm supposed to conduct the mission setting 4 eclub today lor and I ask the members thr to contribute ideas and suggestions. Initially, it was rather smooth-sailing but when I ask them 4 suggestions on events to be planned, they start stoning liao. Then after tat got the grping stuff. Since no one initiate to reallocate their names, I have no choise but to reallocate in random so that each grp have equal no. of pple lor. Then the AHS pple and others were like so unsatisfied wif mi lor, and they didn't even voice it out. How you expect mi to know lor! Sianz... How to get the support of the whole club if every meeting's like tis lor. Onli noe how to speak duno how to do lor.... Haiz no offense here. Juz saying how i truely feel. But rather happy lai wei got a post man coz I'm afraid he'll be angry wif mi should he not get one? Or will he quit eclub? Doubts~ Rather sad today coz pple out thr mostly think it's leonard who'll be the chair lor. Then I scared can't get their fullest support lol. Wat to do dun realli noe everyone thr well lor. Almost broke down today when the whole club was like stoning or rather chatting among themselves. Can u imagine tat: looking around and everyone was like staring at u with the looks tat show a thousand unhappiness... It's looks as if thr's no one beside mi when i needed help most lor. What a failure I am when it comes to tis man. I didn't ask 4 much. Juz your support and contributions are more than sufficient lor. ;(lo  Then went shopping 4 the gifts 4 guests 4 leo club with lai wei. Finally bought 3 cd stand cum clock lol. I think it's more of like finding food to eat rather than shopping 4 the gifts lor. Coz we spent more time finding food than shopping lor.  Luckily went out shop after the eclub camp lor, if not I doubt I can realli pull thr today lor.   Rather confused now. Feel like giving up sometimes but I try my very best to overcome the difficultits. Hope the route ahead isn't as difficult as I realli think it is. Duno how i'm gona face the other club members tml again lor during the camp. Haiz.   Why's all these happening during my birthday lehz.... Haiz. Anyway realli thanks to leonard n lai wei who announce it's my b'dae today during the camp lol. And thanks to the club 4 singing b'dae song for mi.  Am I really a failure? ;(
