They bait you with incredible writing  superb acting in the first few episodes and then abruptly change the directors and writers midway thru the season.  All momentum is lost, the feel of the narrative is completely uneven.  Plot lines are developed only to be abandoned.  In the immortal words of Nancy Kerrigan, "Why, why, why?"
