See, very early in the morning tomorrow, I'm going to the U.S. Embassy in Paris to get a visa because I'm moving to Michigan. Anyway, my father will drive me there, and I said, "Dang, if there's a problem, I can't even have my cell phone to contact you from the inside!". He replied by saying  "Americans are just crazy".  He refered to the security measures  (no bags, no phone...etc).   First, I replied to him  to just shup up   (in diplomatic terms)  since everyone does that now, just go to the France Central Bank, the same rules apply. Second, I told him that I was very disappointed that after reading an essay about Anti-Americanism, he still had those ridiculous comments.  You see, that's what bugs me about France, even though my father is not French, he has the mindset. It's not occured to him that after all these threats the embassies have faced, they might want to consider having some security rules. I hate it here. I just want to get the hell outta here!
