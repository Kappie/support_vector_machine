Do we feel hurt, because of failure of the possesion of the person we "love"" Or is it because it's a response to rejection or even failure to be able to protect the person. Whatever it is, since love is not all about feelings, it links back to actions. I think we still feel hurt and sad that we can't be with the person we love, but in the end, if our sections ultimately place the happiness of the person above other concerns. That would be loving. For it is sacrificial, having to got thru the pain and putting aside our own concerns. It becomes not whether it's a painful action, but whether the painful action is done willingly with love for the other person's good.
