I heard a man rant about the misuse of quoation marks earlier today. I realized I'm altogether far to guilty of this crime - overworking the un-unionized quotation mark. Like some sort of illegal immigrant standing on a street corner, I pluck the poor mark from its resting place, slap it around a phrase or trendy witticism that I'd like to emphasize, and expect it to produce some sort of grammatical miracle. Not much of an issue coming from the Lord of the Splice but it does stand to reason that I should give the quotation mark a bit of a chill period. For the time being I'm going to avoid using them or switch to either   italics (classy!) ,  bolding (trashy... booo)  , or just plain *asterisks* (*lame*).  Much like Dr. Frankenstein I'm assembling a CD out of lost tracks of long forgetten CD's in my collection. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, though, I am spitting directly in the eye of the Recording Industry Artists of America by downloading every single track from a variety of sources of pirated material. While this, in an of itself, is not a copyright violation (I own all of the tracks I am downloading), I am going to take the time and effort to share this collection online with as many other music lovers as possible. This is, of course, not to fuck the artist out of their well earned royalties (meagre though they might be) but instead to take a moral stand on an issue that most of us (rightly) don't give a shit over, and won't give a shit about until it effects us directly (tranlslation: till we get a god damn subpoena (love the spelling of that word, incidently) in the mail). It has occured to me that it is suprising that more acts of urban terrorism do not take place. God damn, I'm getting to the point where I'm am seriously miffed about being shit on. Were I of a less stable temperment (HA) I think I'd be finding me a truck full of fertilizer or a pie full of C4 or somesuch and just outright eliminating the place where the RIAA does business. A warning shot across the bow of the greedy, if you will - Robin Hood, with heavy ordinance. Or is that Ordnance? Or is heavy ordnance just serving someone with an expensive parking ticket?  I just regrettably wrote some rather inexplicably bad poetry. Thankfully I had the good sense to delete it.  Poetry. It's worse than Aids.(tm)
