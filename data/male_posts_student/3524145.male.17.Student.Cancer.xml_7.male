Later after the bible study... its Baptism Service~!!... woahz.. cool... happy to see so many people having their "funeral" like what ps daniel say... dying with Jesus and rise with a new body... congrats to those brothers and sisters~!...   Woahz... i am lucky ... tml have no lessons... so i have another one day of holiday... hope its not a bad thing... i gonna stay home to do some cleaning up i guess... keke... we shall see...
