I'll just post the older ones today as a bunch.....by the way,  urlLink my webpage  (which don't allow FTP as I don't want to pay a bunch of cash monthly... shame on them, shame on them!!!)       urlLink    ... urlLink         July 29 - 2003  Had to start one day, haven't I....?  Well, I'll try not to bore. Yesterday went to the movies and saw "28 days later" for a second time... but still good... Bad company though, I mean I love those girls with all my heart, but they got all the gore and not the story.... shame on them... shame on them...  Ok, about the movie... Is good, people... but hope that u see it with an open mind. Try to put yourself in his shoes.  Yesterday was a good day, I mean, met a bunch of new people, cool people, and hanged with my usual friends... even though the day was hot and humid, and I hate that.     July 30 - 2003  How difficult it is to get into a relationship. I don't want to be the first in someone's life, in fact, I'm trying not to be. It's a cliche? Yes, but it is also a valid one. Don't want to get all my hopes up and then get blown away because what it was going to happen happened.   But man, it sure gets lonely with rules over time. Anyway, I am making friends in the process at least. And for those who care, IT IS NOT ABOUT AGE, or experience... It is just common sense.  In other issues, school is near, again. this time it seems that I'll be more (if that's possible) busy.... Long schedule...  Maybe if I were a little bolder I could get over all this dating scene and grab someone that matters, but I don't want to be, I am happy the way I am. I just hope to meet someone that could share the same interests that I have. But here's the catch, I don't want a serious relation, 'cause I know (and I have) it won't be my priority (sad but true), I want something lighter, I mean, I don't go sleeping around and I am not promiscuous (BELIEVE ME) just don't want to get tangled in all this time-priority-leave classes to be with me-meet with me every night 'till long hours of the night kind of relation, but I want more than a friend... Do I make sense?      August 07 - 2003  Been working on new drawings, and trying to learn Macromedia's Studio MX.  What is it with sex, or with me for that matter? ... I don't seem very interested in it. Lately, I realized, I've been living a sexless life, the odd thing is that it has been for a long time, but just in the past months have I come to the conclusion that I just don't miss it. And for the record, is not that I don't have someone to do it, is just that I don't want to do it. There are days that I seem more in tune with my sexual needs, but it is never a craving or a NEED, just the hotness of the moment.  Am I worried? Hell yeah!!! Is not a feeling that I want. I'm a firming believer that a relationship is not just about companionship and friendship but also sex, 'cause if what you want is just the first two, then get a dog ( luckily I have 4!!! ) and I do want a relationship. I have tried to cure myself, Playboy channel is my witness, but nothing, is just not there.   Been told is just a phase, it'll wear off.   In other matters, I've been getting tired of all this design, that's why I'm trying to learn everything macromedia... but is just so much work.... and I don't like reading tutorial or whatever the name of the PDF files the program has..... is bad for my tush and my back, oh and also for my eyes. ALL IN THE NAME OF ART...!!!     August 09 - 2003  What's the deal with everyone's life, I mean, drama here, drama there... and my life seems just drama-free. All this 'cause I've been browsing the web and found this place (well not much of finding, I was sent a link by a friend) where people has a blog and just such a drama everywhere. All my friends are in the same page, specially women. When will they understand that as far as the relationships they have those equal drama.  Maybe I'm just too methodical or boring or whatever, but I do live a happy life at the moment... stress free... but I do need money though...  oops!!! There's my drama!!!     August 12 - 2003  I've been fighting with the idea of a journal or diary, binnacle, whatever you wanna call it... Most of the ones I've read are focused on everyday minutiae. Till I found this one called  urlLink justins' life , about a gay guy in, I think San Diego, and even though he deals in his diary with everyday events, he pours everything in it, all his mind, his feelings, etcetera, a little whinny but it is a cool way of doing it....   urlLink
