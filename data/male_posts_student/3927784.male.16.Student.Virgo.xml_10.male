I have no idea, and i didnt realise the country was into transexuals until now. But she gave us laughs, thats the main thing......isnt it? Today i'll be looking at the contestants, and my favourite and worst bits of the show.  Firstly, I'd like to express my outrage ( CJC Note : Again?) that Dan - or Gandalf the Gay - didnt win. Yes, i've heard the comments that if someone wants a gay man to win then they are gay themselves, but i dont find that true. ( CJC Note : I find that people that cover up their own sexuality by calling other people gay, are actually hiding something themsleves).  Anyway, as promised, heres my summary of the characters, in what i can remember to be the order of eviction:   Kitten:  Who? Oh yeah that shakey one. I didnt like her before she even entered the house. She was dressed like a typical lesbian and was uuuglay! ( CJC Note : Whatever happened to the good looking lesbians that we see in films?) I'm so glad she was evicted first. Yay!   Emma:  She wasnt actually evicted properly, so she could of won it. But then she might of been favourite therefore pushing Dan down another place, or even evicted before the final 4. Oh well. ( CJC Note : As i like to think, everything happens for a reason!)   Vanessa:  They claimed she was the best looking contestant to grace the screens of BB, but i disagree ( CJC Note:  I liked that Tania and Anouska better) but obviously that wasnt enough to keep her in. I think she should of been a bit more fun and kinky. What i find is that the public want the women to be like this, and when they do, they vote em out!)   Marco:  What a bloody mincing queer he was. He annoyed me straight away with his....mincing! But i thought he was a bit funny, and that helped him stay in.   Becki:  Perfect example of someone that acted kinky and got voted out. She started to get on my nerves a bit, and i presume everybody elses aswell. And them teeth! God!   Ahmed:  I thought he might of stayed in longer...as much as i didnt want him too. He didnt have fun, and when you dont have fun, you get evicted. ( CJC Note : Except Jason, for some reason!)   Victor : He seemed to of had 2 personalitys. I prefered the softer side because he joined in more, and didnt wreck weddings or start fights, which eventually led to his eviction.   Michelle : At first, i liked her because everyone like Shell and Vanessa were picking on her. Then when everyone else liked her (CJC Note: Wasnt that when Vanessa left and Shell was on her own therefore having to make new friends?) she became "The Bunny Boiler". That really got on my nerves, especially when she said "Do you remember when you used to make bread with me?" like a mong. She got what was coming to her (CJC Note: No not when Stuart was voted out. And no not when they done it under the table. I meant eviction!)   Stuart : I kinda liked Stuart, except when he kept slowing his words down and saying erm in everything, which kinda bored me to death. He was funny in his costumes with his surfer phrases, but that was it. And i found that when Michelle left, he came out of is shell a bit,   Shell : I thought she was quite good looking, and has a great body. Her voice done my head in though, because it was too posh and squeaky. Plus she cried at every given opportunity.   Dan : As i said before, i "loved" Dan. He was funny, and he took the piss outta Nadia, what more could you want. I'm a wee bit pissed of that he didnt win though.   Jason:  I thought he would of gone much earlier than this, because all he did was moan, sleep, pose in the mirror and most of all, was scottish.   Nadia : The Egg on legs won, and now she feels accepted. How long before no one knows her anymore. Only time will tell.  My favourite part of the series was between the bedsit thing and maybe " Fight Night ". ( CJC Note : Hang on, werent they the same thing?) or maybe the night with the jam.  My worst part of the series was when nothing good happened. Or maybe the way Stuart was evicted - so sad. No wait, it might of been when Dan didnt win!  So, this is the last time i'll be writing anything about Big Brother. What will i do from now on at 10? What will there be in the papers to read? One way to find out.......   Come back next time for something not Big Brother Related,
