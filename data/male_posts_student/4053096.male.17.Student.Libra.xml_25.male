I got Dave a gift, but just in case he reads this, I won't elaborate. But yeah. It has been awhile since I have walked that mall so extensively. I'm not too much of a mall kinda guy. Well, I'm not sure if there are too many guys that like the mall. I talked to a guy outside the ladies dressing room (don't get any bad ideas; I was waiting for Bon). Anyway, we talked about the differences of shopping between girls and guys. Ok, girls have to look (and try on) everything  before  they can decide what they want. A guy looks only at what he wants (sometimes brousing), and then tries on what he has picked  after  he has decided what he wants. Now I know perfectly well that there are exceptions, depending on what is being shopped for, etc.; and also that there are girls and guys that are different. But on average, that's about how it runs. That's thoroughly unimportant, but I needed something to write. All I'm trying to say is that I talked to a guy that I didn't even know. I don't do that much. I guess I should try to be more "outgoing" or "friendly" or whatever you want to call it. We also talked about school. He was interested to the fact that I was home schooled. I didn't think to ask his name. He didn't either, so that's probably why. But yeah. We went to Wal-Mart after we left the mall. Loads of fun there. I love Wally World. Such a great place. Well, I'm getting tired, and plus I'm out of stuff to type, so
