We will either a) lose money or b) get our shares bought out by the owner!" Do not worry because this will not happen! :)  I will give this blog lets say....... 10-15 days longer. If nothing is really posted by then, action will have to be taken. I.E. the blog will be deemed DORMANT and will stay that way until someone blogs again.....  So for now, STAY TUNED!!
