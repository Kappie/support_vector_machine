Don't despair - I think its the app and not you. Since I am the administrator of this blog (not to mention the eldest cousin) I thought I would address the situation. See - I got your back!  Another suggestion is to log into your blogger account and create a new post as you normally would. To insert a picture, click on the picture frame icon located to the right of the spellcheck icon in the toolbar above the text box. Position your cursor on the line you would like to insert your photo. This should work if the app is working properly.  On a brighter note, I'd like to welcome Darryl and JP to the blog. Thanks for joining us here guys. We can't wait to read your entries. I'm really glad that this project is going well. I really enjoy blogging (now there's a big surprise!) and reading your posts. I think we have an entire family of talented and very entertaining writers here.   Edit: I did a test on the photo insert function and the app is down. So Cin, don't kill your pc just yet. Hee!
