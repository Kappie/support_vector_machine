So far they are very promising. I was also advised to go to  Skol Beat  at the club this friday, still don't know if i'm going.   Yesterday was kind of Weird, at least at night. I "Somehow" contracted a virus on my pc, i still really don't know where it's from, altought i have an idea. It infected all  my  Java  apps and files plus some files in my  Final Fantasy VII  directory. First sign that i had a virus was that some .exe were dispearing of my hd. Namely my Anti-virus and my telephone software. I was a bit freaked out but i knew what to do. I condamned  Internet Explorer 6.0  and switched for  Mozilla FireFox 0.9 . I also added  Outpost 1.0  firewall and proxy.   Only god know how much i hate virus.    Wanderley  came to my house and we played a bit of stuff. He really liked the  War Of The Ring Demo  and the Snes game  Ninjawarrior .  regards,  Zephyr
