"Conservative messages don't have a chance in contemporary Hollywood," filmaker Jason Apuzzo said. "But there's another side in Hollywood. We are small in numbers but passionate."  Apuzzo is right on target in response to the crazy idea that conservatives are "whining" and need to "get out there and produce". There is no Conservative voice in Hollywood. If you are in the Homosexual Lobby, you'll be treated better that if you were a Republican or have a Conservative message. I like to compare today's Conservative Voice in Hollywood to the past, in the 50's and 60's. Back then, if you were a communist, you had better keep quiet and people were often blacklisted and lost their jobs. Now, if you are a conservative, thats pretty much the same. The rich and powerful in Hollywood will see that you crumble and won't stop from making you a failure till you are on your knees. You can add the Jason Apuzzo to the short list of conservatives in Hollywood... 1. Mel Gibson 2. Bruce Willis 3. Dennis Miller 4. Jason Apuzzo
