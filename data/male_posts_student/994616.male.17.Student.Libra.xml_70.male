In the evening we all piled in our cars in two and fours and made our ways to the Chinese Restaurant on Terminous street. The night started off fairly decently - Caroline was opening her presents, a book of erotic stories, some disney princess books - come to think of it though they're one in the same- and some condoms, a very interesting series of gifts. She had the most beautiful ring too  The real fun started when Jared, Horwood, Luke and Evan got up and sung. The did house of the rising sun. The main gripe i have is (remember that karaoke is there for bad singing) was that either they held the mikes too far from their mouthes or they were too quiet - SPEAK UP DAMNIT. Caroline and Jenny sang, i think the most rousing part of the song was "Gek Australia" moving and yet touching.  I had a talk with Aaron and he's going to try to be nicer - which is good. No more avoiding him :P Though one thing i didn't get to say to him was that even though there has been a retro revival tight pants and button shirts without undershirts didn't come back. on the upside though he wore red which is more of his colour :P  Now because luke went offline before I had a chance to say this to him I shall say it here.  Luke I know you have  high hopes, and I know that right now your feeling a bit disheartened but giving up won't help you. It's tough  but you have to have the determination and one of the things i have always admired in you is that you CAN do it, you do work, you do study, if you do try; don't stop that now, you beat me in the trials at  math, and I (lets face it) rock at math, so that says something. Don't forget the math trials are ALOT harder than the HSC. Also the math course is a hard one, there were entire school where not a single student 'passed'.  And don't forget you have all sorts of resources to help you you can try the HSC help line teachers I'm sure Evan's willing to lend a hand. In summary : You rock, and therefor you can do it so don't stop trying  1 up shroom: Luke  Poisoned shroom: My king lear essay which, again hasn't gotten done  I'm listening to  It's Gonna Be Me  by N'Sync for more info on them click  urlLink here  I'd say its about 3 out of 5
