I live right in the suburbs of the boondocks of Maryland, and I go to a Jesuit high school.  No, don't ask me which one; it doesn't matter.  At the time I am writing this, I am nearly 16 and have just completed a 10-day leadership program (which basically taught me that it isn't just Maryland -- people are two-faced, lying whores across the country) and am returning to my incredible summer job in which I do all the work and whichever spoiled brat is working the shift with me slacks off and gets paid the same.  I listen to most types of rock, shying away only from the soft and punk varieties (we'll get into why later), but I can also appreciate the spirit behind such music as country (although you ain't gonna see me jamming out to that anytime soon).  I, unlike pretty much every other quasi-intelligent student in my school, am a devout christian, but not necessarily a Catholic anymore (another thing I don't feel like talking about now).    If you're still awake after reading this, you either drink way too much caffeine, are incredibly bored, or know me.  In any case, keep reading these posts.  You may find them interesting, funny, or useful for toilet paper.  I'd prefer the first 2, but I honestly couldn't give a damn about the last one in that this blog is free.    Fun stuff.
