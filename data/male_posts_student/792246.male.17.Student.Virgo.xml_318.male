Does gayness mean anything to people anymore? -Chris Richardson got the "I-Love-Me" award, which pretty much is the greatest thing ever. -How did Jessie Ferguson lose to Hannah Junkerman for "Heavenly Voice". -Two people have Shelties that look a lot like Tillie in their pictures. I better start collecting royalties. -My picture styill sucks. But some of the ones surrounding it make it relatively the best evah. -How the fuck did Jay Hoffman get into "Viking Bods"? -In the "Twinkling Eyes" picture, you can see neither person's eyes. -How the hell do you misspell "Williamson"? -Elizabeth and Shiranne have the cutest pictures ever. -"In Vogue" apparently means "Most Asian". -Kalani Leifer is the fucker that beat me for Best Hair, which I can sort of live with. His hair is the shit. -I have the best Senior Write-up ever. Like, seriously. -In "Who's your Idol", someone wrote "The french freshmen". This may or may not be intentionally plural, but the more important issue is: Is Shmark pimpin it? -Simon spelled Booya wrong. Fucker. -John Kamikihara has the best quote ever in his write-up. I'm such a loser I have to write it here. "Mom: You were always there to yell at me both at school and at home. I won't forget all the embarrassing moments and all the stupid fobbish things you've said." -Gabe is insane. Anyone know what the hell his write-up means? Dear god that boy is crazy. -The Theatre page is good. There are cute pictures of Portia, Elan, Peter Dolkas, Rohan, Jon Morag and more. -Kimmy! -The Elizabeth in the Mock Trial picture looks disturbingly like Elizabeth with the Chicken Dance Hamster picture. -Joel no longer goes to the school nor has a picture in the Juniors section, but he still has a quote. -Amelia looks like a crack addict.

Plus I didn't know anything about this whole quote crap, and they screwed up the pathetic quote I did give. And the picture sucks. They should have had a little box that just said "See last year's yearbook for picture and sexy picture of President Bun-Bun". -They screwed up and put Adam's Robotics quote in for the Special Friendship club. The quote for it reads "We're learning about technology that will help us in the future." WTF mate? -I used to make fun of the Anime Club pictures back when Jeannie Beacom was President, but I'm starting to realize she was smart. They are annoying just looking at the picture. I'm going to turn the page now. -The Christian Club has two white members! -Is there one normal person on Calliope? -Devon looks so incredibly ugly in his picture it's like not okay. Meanwhile Bret looks like a serial killer, which might be true. -Joy Farber (the goth chick) is listed twice, with two different pictures. Weird. -Allison has the cutest picture ever.

Brenton in a speedo! EWWW! EWW EWW EWW! -As usual, there is the diving team with one guy on it, and the hot tub picture. Is this becoming a tradition or something?

Fuzzies! -Brittny Norah got a whole page. -Haha! Gabe is tiny! -Kai was the cutest little kid.
