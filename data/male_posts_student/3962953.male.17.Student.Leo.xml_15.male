You see, as on my behalf, as much as I appreciate the ideas you guys are presenting for the comic, if you truly have anything you can e-mail me, and to personally avoid my e-mail address getting spammed, you can access my mail through my website "Negative Space"; you can find the link on the right hand side bar of this blog. You may also tell me it via AIM if I'm ever on. Don't hesitate to e-mail me or Cory about anything, Cory gets almost instant verification of incoming mail and I check my mail at least twice a day if not more. From thence forth, and as I understand thus far about how Cory wishes to run things, which I mainly agree with, this blog was designed for the purpose of us presenting the ideas for comics that we have, or, with the help of your suggestions, have conjured up and are experiencing troubles with a certain element to the plot or a scene, etc. It is then we post the dilemma on the blog awaiting response from you guys. Your a crucial part, true, but we need you more for feedback than ideas.   Don't get me wrong though, I don't want to deter ideas, but rather would wish for you to route them to their appropriate place. I've made many comics from AIM conversations and ideas sent through you guys, such as Vito's car ideas, but please present them to us away from the blog.   For example, a posting like  "Hey guys, I thought it might be cool to change this to that and that to this and yadda yadda!"  or  "Hey there, I thought it'd be cool to draw Ryan with fluffy clothing and driving a Ford Pinto!"  Or the like, those seem fine with me, and I'm sure Cory, but we truly don't appreciate being told what to make our comics out of.   And Cory...don't fucking touch. -_-  Thanks for your cooperation guys,
