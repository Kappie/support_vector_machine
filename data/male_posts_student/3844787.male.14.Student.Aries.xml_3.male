So there is nothing I can do.    Yesterday, I didn't have any lunch or dinner, so in the end I had a chicken sandwich at 11pm, I actually did go too Tesco's too buy a pot noodle, but instead came back with some adidas Eau De Toilette, hair gel and a book called 'The Curious incident of the Dog in the night time', so far its quite a good book, its about a boy with Asperger's disease who find's a dog in the morning with a fork through its chest, and he becomes a detective trying too find out who killed it. Its a sort of muder mystery novel, its quite interesting.     Anyways, I might buy a pot noodle.
