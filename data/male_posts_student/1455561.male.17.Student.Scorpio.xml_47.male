To the layman it may seem that i am only writing this so that i can leave the mechanics past papers for another half an hour but what i am actually doing is carrying out an in depth sociological experiment so incredibly important and intricate that although i could explain it, a large percentage of the readers would develop nosebleeds and possibly aortic aneurysms*.  I tried explaining it to a tramp once and they were so confused that they completely imploded in on themselves leaving no trace they had ever existed apart from a faint lemony smell.  All i will tell you is that it involves music, jam, an albatross and laughing.  bye bye everyone, bye bye.   *aortic aneurysms are possibly the best way anyone could ever die ever.  ever.  The aorta (big artery from the heart) attaches to the windpipe for support in one area.  If you have high blood pressure the aorta can sort of pop open into the windpipe.  The overall result is that the person will feel a sharp pain before their head flies back and blood fires out of their mouth and about 2 metres in the air.  Who wants to die peacefully when you can die spectacularly.  (amazing: half two already)
