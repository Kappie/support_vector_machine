What the freak!!! make me wait like gundu... nvm, i loiter ard orchard...  then liqing call me and ask me go meet them at Lido... i walk from orchard mrt to Lido... i waited at Lido... while going up the escalater, saw my sj teacher... i immediately turn my head and look away... haha... she is with her husband...  i found a seat and settle down... ahhh... my teacher walking pass... i act like i playing my phone... haha... i get kinda bored... so i play puzzle bubble on my hp... 10 mins later, they called and say they were downstairs... FINALLY!!!  we met up and they went to 'bought' the tickets... then i chatted with liqing abt the sj teacher and her husband... haha... then all of them went downstairs to eat mosburger... i stayed upstairs to eat long john with liqing... cuz... both of us cannot eat beef... haha...  times up... we proceeded into the threatre... the movie started... we sat right at the back... the sound effect so bombastic siaz... the show quite nice actually... abit sad, so many ppl died... abit happy... sam and his father finally met up... some parts quite funny... but overall i graded the show alright lah... hui kheng and shu hsien cried... i say they all siao... where got ppl watch show until cry one... not as if the show is meant to be sorrowful... oh yah, smth i find it funny... there's this gal sitting in front of hui kheng... when it came to the part of the wolf attacking sam they all, this gal like siao one... like jumping up liddat... then me and hui kheng keep on giggling... but frankly speaking, that part was really scary...
