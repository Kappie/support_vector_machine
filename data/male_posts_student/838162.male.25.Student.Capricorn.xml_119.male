I had figured it to be a problem with the re-directing service from Pacific Internet and that they would fix it after a few days. However as it turns out the problem lay with how they handled the URL to be directed to, which required a change in the settings, of which I only discovered today after much testing. However it seems like this only solves the problem for a short while, then it pops up again. Really looks like a problem server side. Hopefully they will fix it soon but in the meantime I’m looking into finding a new web host for the site. Having trouble coming up with a good domain name though. Any Ideas anyone?
