Lucky ducks......we high schoolers and public schoolers still gotta suffer another two months while they bathe in the 17 degree celcius May sun......or go back to Toronto. Bleh.....then there's us still toiling in our binders in our classrooms like there's not end. But instead of thinking about that........there's much brighter things to think about in our lives. For example.......church today.....  First day of church during daylight savings time period. Yup.....for the next "x" amount of weeks our human biological clocks are basically set forward an hour, meaning we have to RESHIFT our body's adaption from winter. So like everyone else I lost an hour of sleep *grrr* and woke up and then left for church. Yes daylight savings time seems to still have some people forgetful. I mean I've seen that happen before.....but what happened to Jason today I'd never think I'd see lol........  Basically what happened was Jason........he set his clock because I kinda reminded him last night. But......instead of setting it forward......he set it BACK another hour. So technically.......he's two hours behind at any moment. This is the first and probably the ONLY time I'd see someone fail to set a clock properly. He was wondering why he felt so energetic in the morning....maybe because he slept for 10 hours? So when I got to his place to pick him up...yes he was sleeping. And so I headed out to church then. He'd come afterwards but yeah.....setting your clock backwards more than it already is? Sad................lol  So got to church on time still.......and I had to do ushering this morning in place of Grace since she was doing praise and worship. Steph came afterwards too to help. Josh today was on Bass in Worship. Bass+Piano isn't that bad of a combo at all. Message today was about the verses in Chapter 4 (vesres 8-9) that talk about basically thinking of positive things....and do/think about things positive if you want the Heavenly Father to be with you. One song that really hit me was probably "Be Thou My Vision." The idea of Christ being my lifelong vision......fits theme really well hehe.  And then.......afterwards today NO SUNDAY SCHOOL! Today was the day where we head to Youth for Christ center and just have some fun.......last day for some UWO students. *Sigh* to think Conni, Ali and Mike are leavin'......graduating already *sniff sniff.* So quick......I still remember last year when I made a remark basically implying I thought Connie was 30 when she's barely 24 lol. Or back in Grade 5 or 6 when I played the piano for Children's Sunday School's Christmas performance replying to Ali's call for a Pianist. Seems like such a long time ago.......yet so short also. And of course Mike's unforgettable announcement time always after service:  "Hello everyone and welcome to LCAC. Is there anyone here that's new that'd like to introduce themselves?"  Yeah that line will be remembered on and on throughout the years lol. So we all headed downstairs after benediction.....and just hung around for a bit. Took a few photos....talked.....ate food.....  Well at the YfC place.......we basically just chilled.....talked you know good times. Playing ball and stuff. Wow.......I made 3 HUGE rejections today.......so cool though lol.......I seem to play better ball fooling around =P. Also Bump was fun....though I lost both times it was pretty fun playing it. I got some people out ^_^. And yes like usual Gabe was a beast at ball lol...probably best player at LCAC. Chilled with some people for a bit.....but most of my time consisted of playing ball and fooseball and pool and volleyball lol. Then one game of Big 2. Basically my afternoon was pretty fun. Our church should have more of these occasions. Yeah but I'm gonna miss those UWO kids.....lol me calling university students kids.....makes me look like im 30 haha.  Then ride home....got a lift from Pastor Mackness. We had to wait for Steph's mom and Gavin's family to come pick 'em up though. Lol so we all waited around for a bit. Kendrick started kicking Brian's car for some reason lol....and I got chased around the parking lot for throwing a volleyball at Victor's Camry hahaha. Gimpy in the end kinda beat the crap outta me but s'all good.....I hit his car and I felt sorry for the guy.....making a gimp run after me hahaha. Boy if he reads this blog he REALLY gonna whoop my ass lol. Oh yeah and when Victor was chasing me around ready to kick the crap outta me.......Kendrick took his car and tried to run me over too lol. In the end we all waited in Pastor Dale's car........and eventually yes they did come.  Hmm.........bleh after some running from Victor hunting me down and also avoiding being chased down by his Camry....FINALLY I got to go home lol. Got home and first thing on agenda: TYPE OUT HYPE REPORT. Done =P.....then..........SC!!!!! lol.  Yeah played a few rounds of that...I really suck at the game now.  Drummed afterwards...  Then dinner......mmmmm........food. And then after that.....well bloggin' hehehe. Yeah today was pretty cool day........I don't know why but lately I seem to not be able to fill in detail gaps anymore......my 3 page blogs have shrunk to 1.5.  Then again......yeah I think I should probably start doing my devos soon.....Purpose Driven Life= REALLY GOOD BOOK. I've been encouraged to read it every night before I sleep now I think. I like it a lot though.....probably gonna recommend it to a friend later on. Actually Lina said she wanted to start reading the Bible.....figure this mite help a bit =P. Oh yeah and just talkin' to Mike Chan just now.....apparently he's been operating on non-daylight savings time for the whole day. HOW I don't know but somehow he did lol. "No wonder why work today was so weird." Yeah no wonder =P.  Well anyways.....yeah I'm out for the night. To HYPErs: SIGN UP IN OUR NEW SITE:   urlLink    Lates.
