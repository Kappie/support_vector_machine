I can't even make myself go into the living room and figure out if I have a pen in my backpack to take to class tomorrow.  I'm having a difficult time even thinking about making it to my first class, which is at NOON.    *sigh* Just thinking about all of that made me feel tired.  Maybe I'll swing into the "routine" after a few days, but chances are NO.  After "a few days" it will already be my weekend because I only have 3 days of class (and three classes for that matter) this semester.  I assume that right around the time my peers are getting back into the groove of things for the semester, I'll be sleeping until 2pm again because it's MY saturday, even though it's normal people's Friday.  This is gonna rock.  I think I will skip my first day of one of my classes, and let me tell you why, let me just tell you.  This prof. does all of his classes the same.  It would  literally  be a waste of my time to go, get the syllabus (same one he gives out for all the other classes he teaches that I have been a student in), introduce myself, tell people where I'm from, and then go home.  I'll just run along to day #2 of class instead for that one.  OFF TO A GOOD START ALREADY MASON.  Speaking of telling the class where I'm from, I HATE that game.  I hate that in some 'faculty lounge' in some stupid university in some stupid town in America, professors got together and decided that a good thing to do on the first day of school would be to get to know one another.  Guess what, profy, I don't give a sh*t about who is sitting next to me.  Chances are, if they're sitting next to me, I already know them and that's why I chose that seat.  OR I didn't know anyone so I had to sit next to some loser that I DON'T want to know anything about.  So ZIP IT, cholo, I don't want to know that you're from Little Rock and that an interesting fact about you is that you play the flute with your eye.  Prof's LOVE to make you tell an "interesting fact" about yourself.  I enjoy this first-day-of-class game so little that I decided last semester I would just make shit up.  I went ahead and introduced myself, told the class I was from Seattle, and that my interesting fact was that I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina until my family moved to the United States.  Take THAT.  Gave people who know that I'm not even remotely foreign, a good laugh though.  I can't BELIEVE he had the nerve to give me a "C" later that semester, c'mon I'm not even FROM here, can you blame me for not performing as well as these well acclimated American students?   What will tomorrow's lie be when I'm asked to tell such 'interesting facts' by a professor.  I think a good lie would be "I'm happy to be here" but my disgusted face might give away that fib.  Nah, I probably wont be mendacious at all, and just tell them the norm, that I play a flute with my eye, and that I learned back in Arkansas.. and YES, I DO know the family that Paris Hilton stayed with for the show on Fox.  So back to motivation, I really hope I can get into the routine again and get some stuff accomplished.  The year is already almost half a month OLD!  I better get a move on.  Time to make my to-do list!
