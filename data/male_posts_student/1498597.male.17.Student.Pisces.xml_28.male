Anyway, lets take a current look at the few blogs out there before we get started on our next blog about why life sucks.    JR  updated the  Punk Rock Editorial . He says some true things there! You should all read it!           Elyse's  blog has not changed since last night... so nothing to report there that is new.   My own blog  Needs some updating soon. I think I very well do that. Yes, I know I put some sappy American-song in there. The purpose was not to show the patriotism (ok, maybe a little), but it was to show how FUCKING funny the song is (and how true it is also). That is the update for the A.M. for the blogs.  At  9:02  no one is online on either AIM or MSN. What? Do people actually sleep in around here? No  J.R., Elyse, Elizabeth, or Mario or Eddie . Too bad I guess. I will just have to wait a little longer for someone to come online. Stay tuned....... much much more is to come!
