I really don't have all that much to write, but I want to get into the habit of updating this as regularly as I can.  On Friday, I hung out with Sabrina and Jen. Had lunch at Harveys and went to Fairview. What began as a quick run in so Jen could get the Ink anti-theft dealy off her pants turned into an hour or so of cell phone shopping. Pretty funny that both Jen and Sabrina were both being hit on by the salesmen at two different departments. I think one of them(known as Shady)thought I was dating one of them, but wasn't sure which and didn't know which one to hit on, haha. It may have been a bit long, and I may or may not have complained(hehe)a bit, but I'd much rather hang out with cool people like Sabrina and Jen while we do something outside my tastes then do nothing except sit at home. Also headed to Tim Hortons, the flower shop so Jen could buy some flowers for Shawn, and the dollar store. Ooh, and another store, but I'm gonna pretend that never happened.  Saturday, I did nothing. Literally, I just sat and stared.  Today, I forced myself to wake up early after minimum sleep so I can actually get some sleep tonight. A summer of going to bed at 3 o'clock really fucks with a guys body clock.  So tommorow, I head to my first day of school via train. Waking up at 5:00 AM should be an experience. But I'm really looking forward to tommorow all in all. There's not much detail to go into past that, but don't worry kids! Expect a detailed review of tommorow.  She says it's Lack of Sex that's Bringing Me Down. 29 Days.  Signed, Zakky, The Vampire Slayer.
