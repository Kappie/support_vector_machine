I have dial-up (unfortunately) so this was especially eye catching to me, but even those of you luck enough to have DSL or Cable, or what have you this is still cool, because hey, we always want things downloaded faster despite the speed of our internet connection!  You can download this for free  urlLink here       ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
