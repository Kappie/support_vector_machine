Well actually there seem to be alot of us, and I'm actually kinda ashamed that I gave into peer pressure and got one of theese but I am a blogger! So let's see Ill start with Friday. Gael and I took the Moss boys to the Miller's to watch the Two Towers extended edition. That was so much fun, ha ha we would have killed mr. Miller if he was there, we talked sooo much. When we got home we watched the Bourne Identity with Chris and Tim and got to bed at like 3. Saturday we got a Christmas tree and it was   Freakin' cold   outside! Well we got it home and decorated and now it looks all pretty and stuff etc. etc. Let's see now today after church we had the Sanchezs over. We had sooo much fun! We played pictionary, fun fun. Well I'm tired of writing for now seeing as how this is the second time I wrote this post. *mad expression* Oh and don't worry all my posts wont be this big. Peace out. ha ha jk.
