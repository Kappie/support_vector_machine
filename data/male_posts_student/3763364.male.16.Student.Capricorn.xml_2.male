My Guardian Angel status has been revoked. The woman I tried to care for, the woman I tried to help, has fled from me. I knew I would not be able to help her if I could not help myself.   I remember back to a day, it must've been in february or so, although I'm not entirely sure. Her, her boyfriend and I were all in my room, him and I were watching TV. After a little bit of talking, I realized just how much him and I are alike. I remember us finishing each others sentences, saying the exact same things at the exact same times. But it was deeper than that. I knew, that inside him and I were just the same. We were all the same. That is why she chose us. I remember him leaving the room, and me saying to her, that "our destinies had become intertwined." What that meant was that everything that happened to him or to I would affect the other, in much the same way as it did with her. My desinty had now been spun in three directions. One with her. One with her boyfriend. One with me. They must've thought I was full of shit at the time, but now I realize that my prediction was (as always, haha) correct.   She should be back in town very soon. I have not heard from her in a while. I fear I will not recognize her when she returns. Although I know I will.  My little island is drifting farther and farther off the coastline, although, the entire time I knew it would.
