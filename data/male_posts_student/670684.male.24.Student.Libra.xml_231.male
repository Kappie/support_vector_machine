Here I sit, in my Escondido room, with none of the trimmings of a room of mine...I never lived in this room when I was a kid; it only became my room three or four years ago when my stepmom left my dad...it's really just the spare room, but I'm the only person who sleeps here.  Whatever.  I'm in this room.  I'm writing.  On the bed next to me is a plate with the remenants of the remenants of this afternoon's Outback Steakhouse Prime Rib.  Mmmmmmm, Prime Rib.    At Centenary, I made a big hullabaloo about eating as a vegetarian for two weeks.  I had sizeable clout with administrators, and vegetarian friends of mine were complaining about the choices for them at the caf.  So I went a go for it!  It lasted four days.  Day one was salad, bagel, some awful vegetarian casserole medley, more salad, cereal, and cheese pizza.  Tuesday was salad, cereal, salad, salad again.  Day three was a stuffed tomato that must have meant stuffed in several senses of the word, salad, cereal, bagel, toast, and more salad.  Day four was the beginning of the end, as salad no longer looked good, so it was cereal and bread and a grilled cheese, but with american cheese, and I don't know but I just can't get all hot about american cheese...it's just processed shit that is neat because it comes in shrink wrap.  You never see a block of american cheese that you saw off of...when you do, it's either "american cheese product" or "nacho cheese," and that's spicier.  Friday should have been the easy day to eat regular, but the salad bar was wilted, they were out of Special K, and the only bagels left were cinnamon rasin.  I ate fish and red beans  rice...the red beans had sausage.    Today at Outback the meal for two of us cost $54.  Two $17 entrees, an appetizer (my dad loves appetizers...he also nearly collapsed on the golf course today at hole 12...when golf becomes strenuous exercise is when denial should no longer work), and a few glasses of wine'll do the trick.  He gave her $60, and told her to keep the change.  I was upset with his cheapskate ways, so he dropped another dollar.  I threw it back at him and put down $5 of my own...it had been a nice meal, she was a fine waitress, and I had the money to burn.  As we were leaving, he stops the waitress and says, "I don't want you to think I stiffed you on tip...there's another $5 on the table."  She smiled and patted him on the shoulder.  "Good of you to take the credit for that," I said.  "What good would the credit do you?"  he said.    Ironic if that $5 had gotten me laid.  Scary as well.    I wrote a heroically terrible blog entry while at a coffee shop in La Jolla this evening.  I was bored but knew I needed to write, so I headed out to find the penultimate coffee shop.  I would have settled for a bookstore, but they close at 9 on Sundays, and it was 8:45 when I passed the two closest ones.  So I drove into downtown San Diego instead, and spent the next hour and a half searching for coffee canaan.  I got lost half a dozen times...in Point Loma, in Point Loma again, in Mission Beach, in Pacific Beach, in Seaport, and in Mission Beach again.  Once ready to give up, I found gold... Cafe Crema .  I did a fantastically tidy job of parallel parking the Volvo S-Wagon, and walked the two blocks in the cool breeze (not referring to a easy breeze on a warm July day...this is a breeze off a 60 degree ocean in 60 degree weather...I am a jackass for leaving my hoodie in the car in Dallas) to enjoy the rapture of this, my beverage salvation.    The place was packed, the conversations less than inspiring, the kids too trendy, the coffee shitty, the internet not available, and the televisions on The Man Show.  Cafe Crema is a reason that Starbucks does so well.  Since lots of people like honest writing, here's an exerpt from what I title  More Uninspired Shit :   There is a glorious girl here in a tight blue cotton long sleeved shirt and the glorious black pants that make any ass look like ultra ass who looks like a lesser-endowed Christina Ricci.  I’ve been here for 20 minutes, hands in the hair and over the mouth and in positions reckoning ponderment, and she always seems to be laughing.  She and her boyfriend are studying, and she’ll write something and laugh, or say something and laugh, or write and say something and laugh, or just laugh after laughing.  I can get away with looking at her because she is just underneath the line of sight to the television, which carries a marathon of the Man Show.   I'm sure she got laid tonight.  I got prime rib instead.  The sex would have been nice, but the leftover prime rib was damn good...better than the first time, a leftovers event akin to hitting for the cycle in baseball.   Of course, the best sex is better the second time around.  Had there been sex and prime rib?  I wouldn't leave San Diego.    It was only this good because I left the best part for this encore...I went after the regular steak-like part of the meat, saving the fatty tenderloin outer edge for now.  The fat keeps in the flavor, and when the meat is cold, you can work the steak knife like a whittling tool, get the fat away, but you've still got tender meat with all of the flavor.  My mom taught me how to whittle, but not with soap or wood or any other cub scout apparatus...we used steak knives.  I once said that my best trait was typing...my mom's is her uncanny ability to find meat on a chicken bone.  I invite everyone on this blog to come to Naples so my mom can cook chicken.  Eat as much meat as you can off one piece...wings are unfair, but try a breast, thigh, or drumstick.  You'll put it down, content with your finish of said meat.  She'll look over, contemplating, then look up at you, back to chicken, back to you, chicken, your eyes, chicken, your eyes, chicken, distance.  "Are you going to finish that?" she'll say, pretending to be distracted by something in the distance, though there is nothing in the distance but boxes of unpacked books.  "I did," you say, upset at her accusation that you didn't eat your chicken.  "Can I take that?"  she'll ask, nonchalantly but with an aire of pompousness.  And she takes the chicken, and gets out the steak knife, and within two minutes has enough chicken off that bone of yours to cover three side salads and feed the cat.    Looking over the afterbirth of my prime rib, I know she would be disappointed.  Which is said, because I was impressed.  I could write the greatest coming-of-age story ever, win Academy Awards, make millions and buy her a house...but she wouldn't be as proud as possible until I cleaned a chicken bone down to the marrow.
