Seickman decided that he isn't even man enough to tell me to call me and let me know what was going on..  Ohh well this is shit I can deal with..   I just feel bad for Sieckman.. The man with no friends..  I want everyone to look at this and realize how Sieckman treats people in hard times..  not well..  Ohh well not like he had any real friends to begin with so for him not a big loss..  I have been told repeatedly to stop even talking to Sieckman because he is a shitty person which most people can tell just from his actions..  It is my fault for not listening to their advice and I just want to thank sieckman for teaching me a valuable lesson and making it so that he will never again be in any part of my life..  That alone would have been worth it at twice the price...  Sieckman reminds me of a quote from my man Einstein, "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
