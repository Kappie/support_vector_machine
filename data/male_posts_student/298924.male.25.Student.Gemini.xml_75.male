However they are two of my favorite TV shows of all time....they come on early in the morning on TBS....and they both have at least two distinctively different incarnations that make watching the show a little difficult at times.....  Right now ADW (Spelman has a man-bashing course called ADW but that is a rant for another day) is in the Denise Huxtable years....now as any child of the 80's knows, the Cosby Show was the only quality program on TV in the mid 80's and it just so happened that one of the older children would soon be about the age that she would be moving on to college....that can only mean one thing in the world of late 20th century television....SPIN OFF TIME....  Of course this led to many questions....could Denise (Lisa Bonet) carry a show all by herself with her "quirky antics"?.....the short answer is ultimately no....as the many guest appearances by Cosby cast members showed for whatever reason people just didn't care about Denise in this new environment....and as it turns out her getting with Lenny Kravitz may have been the best thing to happen to her because it gave her new life on The Cosby Show later on (I have no life at all....I know....I know)....It also merits mentioning that Debbie Allen came aboard as the producer the next season and things started to jell on the show....I say all that to say that in hindsight these Denise episodes suck (although they still had good ratings....what does the general public know anyway?).....  Great segue into a discussion on Saved by the Bell....because for all intents and purposes this show sucks....I mean the writing was bad....the plots made little to no sense....6 kids and a principal controlled everything that went on at Bayside High and this is before we even bring up the Middle School (Miss Bliss), Tori (When Kelly and Jessie mysteriously fell off the face of the Earth), and God-awful College Years....yet for some reason I feel compelled to watch and enjoy every episode....I really care about the zany antics of Screech and Lisa and Zach and Kelly....the enjoyment of SBTB knows no bounds of race or creed....it is the one thing that all people from my generation can agree on....this show where nothing had to make sense from episode to episode was beloved by everyone....hey! our favorite kids from SBTB have gone on to even do other things (I didn't say they did good other things....)  Here is a many where are they now (or where were they a few years ago other than SBTB related stuff....)  Zach is currently on NYPD Blue....he made some really bad movies that noone saw because he couldn't make any movies about him getting bucknaked and not get branded a porno star.....he also performs stunts in his free time in off road bike races....  Slater was (or maybe still is) on Pacific Blue (another one of those "only TV can think of a premise this stupid" show about cops who can only ride bikes)....he also hosts what some TV exec wants you to believe is a male version of the View, "The Other Half (or something)" with Danny Bonaduce and Dick Clark (I wish I was making this up....)  Screech can't excape the shadow that is SBTB....he was/is on the most recent incarnation of SBTB (what's the deal with that?....I mean when will producers learn that digging up the corpse of Jackie Gleason and televising an autopsy won't make that "The Honeymooners 2002")....yep...he has been typecast....  Kelly played Valerie Malone on Beverly Hills 90210 for a while....she was your standard "young hussy trying to find herself but content to wreck the lives of all of her associates" which isn't bad when you consider....  ....Jessie went on to become the biggest star of them all....playing naked slut-bucket Nomi Malone in Showgirls....now I have seen Showgirls a couple of times (as has been previously stated I have no life....)....when I say this movie has the worst script ever I am including Surf Nazis Must Die in my evaluation....incidentally how ironic is it that both Kelly Kapowski and Jessie Spano went on to play sluts with the last name of Malone....(oh yeah I refuse to call any of them by their real names except Lark Voorhies...no real reason except to be a jackass)....oh yeah she also played a prostitute in the most recent reason for Al Pacino to yell alot, "Any Given Sunday"....  Finally Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (the character who made the least sense in a show that made no sense)....she looked as if she was going to become a legit second tier celebrity after her stirring role in "How To Be A Player" as Bill Bellamy's girlfriend....but alas, as is the fate of many promising Black actors and actresses she has been doomed to a fate of appearing in mindless BET arabesque movies....yep....she is officially a third tier celeb  Until later on....
