It doesnt bother me that much that I didnt go, because if I couldnt go with the person I really wanted to there was no point to go anyway. To everybody who did go, I hope you had a marvelous time, and impart every freakin detail to me tommorrow at school.  If anyone reads this who isnt completely dead from Prom or Prom-night activities and feels like going to see  Troy  or  Shrek 2  or something, give me a call on my cell.
