O.o  Anyhow, today I woke up at about 1:00PM.  Good stuff.  I downloaded some stuff, mostly just Tupac and Linkin Park.  More good stuff.  Then I talked to a special someone.  GREAT stuff.  =)  I can't tell you her name, because then I'd have to kill you?  Not really, just don't wanna cause anymore drama in my life.  After I got off the phone I went out with my mother to dinner then to the movies.  It's her vacation week, so she asked me to hang out with her.  It's kool tho.  Good family time, I suppose.  She wants to do a daytrip thing somewhere on Friday.  I guess Virginia Beach, I dunno.  Well nothing else to say really.  Just been being a guy, I suppose.  Cars, girls, video games, and food, lol.  I'll post once some drama starts up.  It's bound to happen soon.  That is all.
