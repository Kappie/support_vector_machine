Every 5 seconds, they want me to do something else, which I can't do, because I'm busy doing something else, then get pissed at me an hour later whan i can't remember what it was that i was supposed to do because i couldn't remember so many commands!  Grr...  I keep feeling like i'm waiting for something... Like something's supposed to click in my head soon and go "*POP* i'm here!"  Stoopid Alan decided that I have to spend MLK weekend with a bunch if insane UUs to celebrate my birthday by making me chug 3 gallons of sugar.  Here's to Houston.
