Hopefully I'll get the job, Im in a desperate need of a job hahaha. Oh well.  Well, I havent mentioned it yet, but Im on this little Jackass show called RugBurn, its hilarious. If you wanna check it out, its on mskmi.tripod.com. My picture isnt up there yet, in case you may be wondering, but it should be here anytime now. It's pretty cool, and man does it hurt like you wouldnt believe haha. We'll probably be done with Season 2 here anytime, so order your copy today! Hahaha. I, personally, think that Season 1 was funnier, even though Im not on there. But there is some  REALLY  funny parts on Season 2. I would tell ya some of it, but you have to check it out for yourself.  Hmmm... What else is there to put in here. Nothing really, but I'll post in it again before the day's up to tell how the interview went.  Ignore this, Im just seein what it does.  MSK RULES!   All right, Im gonna go.  Later,  Jerry  P.S. I found out, I did tell some stuff that happened. But I did give you the site for it! Haha
