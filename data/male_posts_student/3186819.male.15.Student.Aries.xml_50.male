For a while, I refused to go to church without a reason, was extremely frightened by many aspects of religion, and even stooped so low as to make fun of people who were religious. But now I have matured my visions and have decided I am ready to go to church. What brought upon this suddent revelation? When I saw my sister in a dramatic play "Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames". It was a truly moving and influential experience. Apparantly over 200 people came to Christ over the course of 3 days after seeing the influential play. It was that night that I decided that I would rededicate myself. I was saved in September 1996, but for a long time I really didn't live up to Christianity. So that night, right there in the church pew, I prayed and reaffirmed my beliefs. Now I want to go to church! I am not going to be one of those people who carry a Bible around everywhere and quote verses left, right, and centre, but I will definately have a different point of view. Life should have more meaning now, and I feel better deep down inside.
