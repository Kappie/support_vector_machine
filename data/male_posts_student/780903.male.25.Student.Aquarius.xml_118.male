I had to do all sorts of weird stuff -- create a boot disk, type in commands in DOS, run crazy virus-checking programs -- but I think I've eliminated it without any ill effect.  I had all my stuff backed up onto CD so I wouldn't have lost any information, but still, it was annoying to have to waste time eradicating a virus from my computer.  Ah-choo.
