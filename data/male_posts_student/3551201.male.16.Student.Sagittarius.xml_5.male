Basic economics says that economies have ups and downs, recessions and recoveries. We just happen to be on the upward trend. This issue of the economy is often made into a huge partisan, political issue. As if the president can have do so much. American's should welcome the good news on job growth, but not set sights on politicizing this (even though it always will). We should neither blast George Bush on the economy when it is not at its best, but not give all the credit to Bush when the economy is on an upswing (though I believe tax cuts have helped the transition).  According to MSNBC, "the government reported a blowout employment number Friday, marking the third straight month of strong job gains". 248,000 Jobs were addded in May, spiking up the total in '04 to 1.2 million. “These blowout numbers so far this year are the convincing evidence that the economic recovery is here to stay,” Wells Fargo chief economist Sung Won Sohn said. The unemployment rate held at 5.6. This boom, which exceeded most analysts' predictions, likely confirms that the Fed will raise interest rates soon. The good news was even more satisfying that all sectors gained job, even the manufacturing market at 32,000. The manufacturing sector has had 4 straight months of payroll increases, after three continuous years of losses. "What is really key is that every major sector had improvements," said John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia Securities. "That suggests these gains are sustainable."  Bush still is on pace to be the first president since the Great Depression to have lost jobs during his watch but those losses are shrinking. His administration was widely criticized for an overly optimistic forecast that 2.6 million new jobs would be created this year. But economists now say the chugging economy could approach that mark. "I'm pleased to see strong job growth and that's what I am concerned about," said Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. "Every month of strong job growth is good news to me and it's good news for America."    urlLink    The graphic tracks the unemployment picture for the past year.

The Bush Boom  ---From Best of the Web Today by WSJ June 4th, 2004 More good economic news, for everyone but the Bush-haters: The U.S. economy added some 248,000 jobs in May, according to government figures. The Associated Press reports:  Payrolls swelled by almost 1 million in the last three months alone, the Labor Department said Friday. Employment figures for March and April were revised up to reflect the addition of 353,000 and 346,000 jobs respectively.  On his campaign Web site, John Kerry promises to create 10 million new jobs during his four-year term as president. That's a rate of 625,000 every three months, or only 66% of the past three months' performance under President Bush. Can we really afford to elect someone who sets his sights so low?
