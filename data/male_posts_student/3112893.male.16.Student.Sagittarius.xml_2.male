I doubt it but I need it done.    * Printed like 6 neuroscience papers, but ran out of ink on the 7th of 9 -- I'll read 'em later.    * Didn't load DICOMs with Java Applet -- I'm not surprised though. I didn't put any time into it.    * Practiced Guitar -- Bothered sister, Broke a pick, and I've almost mastered the G and C chords! Watch out, rock and roll hall of fame! Here I come!    * Set up AudioScrobbler Thingy -- Check it out here: http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/TheGermic/    * Drank a lot of various fluids -- And subsequently pissed like 9 times today    * Hugged mommy -- :-)    * Wrote some e-mails  All in all, it's been a pretty boring day. I listened to a lot of music as usual, I worked a lot as usual, I occupied a good chunk of my day with random stuff as usual. Yep... I think it's been a pretty boring day, but at least it wasn't a bad day... Well, kinda -_-          -- Fea'
