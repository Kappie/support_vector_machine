Will talk about that some other time.  I have to tell you about my little "aldersgate" experience. I could sing the song well and I knew the words by heart, but I got nervous when it came to it and my voice quivered in fear. It's coz I screwed up 2 lines during a rehearsal. Great huh. Oh well, like Sidney said, experience and exposure. I have to get over this insecurity thing.  Yesterday, we went to the police academy to watch the rugby finals between ACJC and RJC. All I can say is that pride comes before a fall. Jemima said the same thing this morning during PE. Jem is smart. My throat feels like crap now and I'm having a very bad cold. Level 7.5 zel. hahaha...  I got a message from Zel that really perked up the last hour of the aldersgate day. I was thinking about what I did wrong and I realize. IN Corinthians, the first aspect of love is PATIENCE! That's what I missed out on. I won't make that mistake again. Sumpak!  have to sign off now. ARTS GAMES... I'm ill lah... Play what?! Maybe I'll sign out. We'll see how to wing it.
