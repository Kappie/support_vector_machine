Some of the nail as well as like the skin-nail part and now it is bleeding profusely so Tyke will be typing one-handed for a little while.  And there was just a Snickers commercial on tv and now Tyke is really craving one.  Mmmm...mmmmmmm...*lip lick.  Well today has become a bit of an interesting day.  And that sentence pretty much formed itself so it really isn't all that true.  Today wasn't all that interesting.  Math had a few good jokes in it and weight training was gay because Tyke's shorts got jacked out of his locker sometime since Friday's class.  Only his shorts.  The shirt and shoes got left in there and it was locked up so that is gay.  White shorts with some blue on the side and drawstrings out the middle if you see them.  If you do see them just take them off of whoever is wearing them and immediately return them to Tyke.  And also tell him who was wearing the shorts so he can take action into his own hands.  3rd period was so stupid today.  The final practice AP test and then Tyke helped take some books to Ritzer's class.  The rest of the day was stupid.  And since it was raining pretty hard after school Tyke got wet and that wasn't fun.  Well his after school time hasn't been very interesting at all.  He's watched some TV, ate some food, taken a couple of pretty short naps, got called by the school notifying him of an absence from a class when he wasn't even absent.  Man, the school is just so retarded.  High school is so retarded.  Now that Tyke doesn't just blindly follow the rules like he used to, he has realized how idiotic some things are.  Ahem, grad project.  But Tyke told his mom about some stuff today that he wished he didn't.  Since his mom is sick he felt bad for her so he just decided to sit down and talk with her and he ended up talking about stuff where he either gave him "sage advice" or made it into a "Disney conversation," coined Tyke, or just making a big deal out of nothing.  Tyke didn't get in trouble or anything but it was just stupid stuff.  Tyke ate ice cream out of the carton again today and he wanted to drink some Fresca out of the bottle but he decided against it.  But it made him think about how when he is on his own he can do that stuff and not really care.  So that was kind of "smiley" to think about.  Smiley means something that is kind of fun and makes you smile.  Coining is fun.  Damnit, Tyke is getting really hungry at night.  But he doesn't have anything that he can just sit and snack on.  And he is way too lazy to try to make something.  He was hungry earlier so he decided he would make some soup.  Well, you know those soup cans with the pull-off tabs?  Yeah, those suck.  Tyke never can figure out how hard to pull them.  He always pulls too hard (could be his insane muscular build though) and this time he just ripped the shit off that little bitch.  Oh whoa, still haven't published this.  Haha...well yeah Tyke pulled the top off and it spilled like everywhere and it was a bitch to clean up.  But not has to start planning Prom.  This is hard work and is not something that Tyke likes.  He doesn't know where he's going to.
