On to the third device, the second one lasted barely 3 months. My phone tripped into a spectacular death this morning with a plethora of software and hardware failures: 1. call waiting ceased to work 2. battery refused to hold a charge 3. handsfree crapped out 4. voice quality had deteriorated significantly (from the less than stellar quality it had when it was new) 5. dropped calls galore and bad RF performance.  I must admit I had low expectations for Handspring's build quality as their reputation on web boards was less than stellar.  But this Treo device has exceeded my wildest dreams, more accurately my wildest nightmares.    I give the new (who am I kidding?).....  refurbished device 2 months max before it kicks the bucket.  I thought paying $50 for the device was a bargain, in reality it seems that I have merely broke even as the device has much to be desired in reliability.  Of course, I may be too harsh on Handspring, this was a first generation convergence device and I shouldn't expect much.  What I did expect was a device that retails for $400 to last longer than 3 months under normal use.  Shit, this phone couldn't out last a typical Jennifer Lopez marriage for that matter.  And from what I have heard about the Treo 600, the new $500 second generation convergence device from Handspring, Handspring has done little to improve their build quality.  One plus,  major props to T-Mobile for sending me a newly refurbished Treo 270 and providing a free loaner Nokia to tide me over while it gets here.
