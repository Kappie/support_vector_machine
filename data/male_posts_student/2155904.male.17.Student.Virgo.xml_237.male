But it isn't a bad thing cuz it means that the place will look nice until the next time Tyke's friends come over and they trash the place. So it will probably look good for about 7 hours. After cleaning Tyke went over to Amed's house and he took the van cuz his car was taken to get new pretty tires. Now he will actually have front tires that grip. That's always a good thing. When Tyke got to Amed's they were joined by K-caj and they went down to Seattle for the Bite of Seattle. On the drive over Amed told a nice little story that took up most of the ride and ended up being a solid reference for jokes later on as well. It certainly livened the day. The actual Seattle biting wasn't super fun but it was nice to just walk and talk and get some eats. Tyke got a Philly cheese steak and a really good/big elephant ear. But he actually didn't buy anything else. Lots of free samples but really it was just like being in Costco, without the tasty food. But Tyke is pretty bored of this blog. After the bite, the three went to K-caj's new house on Mercer Island. It's tight. It's bigger than Tyke's house and it's newer too which is neat considering Tyke's house is only 2 years old. It is just a cool house. But new houses are always cool. Especially when they are pretty much empty. They seem so much cooler then. Cuz you always imagine what could go in certain spots and do all of that, "whoaaaa, that would be soooo coooool." They watched Kill Bill Vol. 1 after finally figuring out how to get the sound to work. Then they played Bop-It for a while and then went outside to play badminton in the driveway. Tyke was the second best because K-caj always gets either a weird smash or a soft shot to fall and break Tyke's rallies. But Tyke beat Amed consistently. They played that for a long time and got realllly sweaty before going to 7-11 and then to play poker at Kinker's house. Well Amed was gay and he didn't but Tyke and K-caj did. They played some poker and then K-caj left so Tyke was up a bunch and then he played 31 for the remaining 5 bucks of Kinker's money. Tyke actually won. So he won 10 from Kinker and that was cool. Then he left, came home, got bored of writing, and finished. But he still should clean up some more now cuz he's gonna have to do it early in the morning otherwise. Stupid parents, always having friends over...
