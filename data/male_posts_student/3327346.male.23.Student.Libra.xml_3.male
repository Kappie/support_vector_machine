The electric light goes on when you touch the switch, the  pot stops boiling when the coffee is down, the elevator comes to your floor when you hit the button, the automatic door at work swings open as you approach, the computer comes to life with the turn of a switch….all things just happen as an everyday occurrence. Do you ever stop to think how all that came about. Do you appreciate the fact that someone’s ingenuity and determination brought many inventions about  that we all take for granted.  So many things in live go unappreciated, even life itself. Do you ever stop and think about how lucky you may be?               I recently interviewed a Vietnam veteran who was injured severely during the war. He stepped  on a mine and lost three of his four limbs. He remembers the moment that happened.   So many other veterans  faced similar circumstances, but many had chosen a simple way out. They committed  suicide.  I asked him if he had thought about suicide as well.  His   response was, “why take the easy way out”. He also said that he appreciates life more than ever before.              After meeting that veteran, I must say that we who take our  everyday life for granted are extremely fortunate.    For those who are handicap, or disabled in a way that challenges them to perform in the “ordinary world,”  probably   appreciate  their lifestyle. So many disabled people manage to work and strive for excellence and not take the easy way out. I have to admire them all.   I often think about that   Vietnam veteran  who works for a real-estate company. He  goes to work every day,  driving himself, and has made  something happen in his life. A lot of us may call it a miracle; he calls it determination, hard work, and lastly appreciation for everyday of life.
