(Not that you don't already, or anything, but that's not the point!)  Stupid vision.  *pouts*  I am *not* happy about this.  *sighs*  Okay, I guess that was my rant for the day.  Other than that, I've been momentarily freed from the weight of relatives, and am living the high life on vegetable lasagna and Zenman's strange IM's.  But I'm not eating the latter - or am I? ^_^  *sticks out tongue* Not much to say, just doing my bit to try and keep this poor besotted creature we call *blog* alive. Much love!
