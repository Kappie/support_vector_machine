We board a shuttle to take us to the terminal (I think that's what they call it) where we rode on the left side of the road.  That was quite strange.  So we got to the terminal.  I had to piss like nothing else.  After an eternity of walking and climbing stairs, I finally take a whiz.  After that it was time that time again... AIRPORT FOOTBALL!!!!  I dribbled around a bit b/c no one wanted to play.  Their loss.  Then I stumbled across a couple of errant English newspapers.  I turned right to the sports section to read four whole pages about England's chances in Euro 2004.  At this point I knew England were destined for disappointment.  After more waiting and more walking and more... nothingness, it was time to board the plane to Rome.  We got on and fought with another member of our group for a seat and I prevailed.  After that, we ate and I slept for about a good two hours.  When I awoke, I was pleasantly greeted by beautiful scenery.  We flew over France and the Alps in Switzerland and northern Italy and we flew over endless green fields.  It was a wonderful sight.  We got to the airport and I was glad to see signs in both Italian and English.  I told the elder Pascarella, Stephanie, that I hoped all signs would be in both Italian and English.  I would be mighty disappointed.  It was time to go to the baggage claim.  We waited for our baggage... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... then played some airport calcio... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited until we said "screw it, let's go to our homes and have someone drive them to the hotels".  The hotels were where the chaperones were staying.  I was all for the idea of leaving a long ass time ago because I wanted to get home and watch Italy vs. Denmark.  So we got on a coach bus (last year in America all of the trips were on school busses) and began the three hour trek from Rome to San Benedetto del Tronto.  Tim was the genius who decided to bring his portable DVD player so we watched  Eurotrip.    Eurotrip  was pretty funny.  The moron guy was hilarious and it was especially funny when the dweeb guy was the only one to get some kind of action if you know what I mean.  And the song "Scotty Doesn't Know" is an instant classic.  And the Manchester United hooligans were hilarious too.  And have you ever been to Bratislava?  Good times.  We stopped at a gas station for snacks.  I walked in and stood in an aisle blocking everyone because Sweden vs. Bulgaria was on.  At the time Sweden was winning, by how much I'm not sure, but they were winning.  I bought pizza and realised how much of a problem the language barrier is.  It was quite strange.  And very uncomfortable.  Especially when the waitress out of nowhere started to speak English.  I was totally off guard.  It was time to go back to the bus.  We rode the bus for an eternity in the dark.  It was silent.  I think every one was asleep.  I fell asleep for about 20 minutes and awoke to find myself drooling on my shoulder.  Yeah, it was a good thing everyone was asleep so they didn't see that.  After 24 hours of travelling, we finally... FINALLY reached the Hotel Arlecchino.  It was so great to see everyone again.  Werner, Mario, Beatrice, Ulderico, Alessio, Mattio, Alessandra (all of them), Pietro, Maria and everyone else from last year.  Werner rushed up to me and we gave each other a welcoming hug.  I tried to point Tim to Alessio and his family, but then I say Bea and we gave each other a huge giant mega hug.  It was wonderful to see her again.  And she was cute as always.  Her hair was down to the bottom of her ear which is alot longer than last year.  I really liked it.  I met Werner's family and introduced them to my parents.  We went to the hotel and got the key for my mum and dad.  I left with Werner's family to go and get some pizza.  I had the Margherita pizza which is a very thin, chewy crust with a layer of crushed tomato and cheese.  Yeah, a little bland.  So we sat and talked about the flight and the missing luggage and how Italy can't do a damn thing in international competitions because Giovanni Trapattoni sucks as a coach.  Italy played an uninspired match with Denmark and drew 0-0.  I was tired so it was time we went home and went to bed.  From the time I walked into the house, I felt incredibly comfortable... and tired.  I took out my contacts, got into bed, and fell asleep.   Day 3 later.
