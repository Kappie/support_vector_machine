I have a beautiful girlfriend, Tasha, who moved to Arkansas at the end of the school year.We have been together for 10 months now and I don't think that will be changing anytime soon. I also have a computer of my own that I am overclocking and modding all of the time, I will put a link in later so you all can see my pc if you really get that bored....well looks like thats gonna be about all for now since I have much better things to do than sit around here and tell random people about my life.....
