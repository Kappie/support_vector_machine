We have experienced this today. Thunder Showers effected Deer Lake and Corner Brook but left Pasadena relatively untouched. This also happens in the winter time a lot when School close in both Deer Lake and Corner Brook because of blizzard like conditions. But in Pasadena every thing will be fine and dandy. But that’s interesting to me I have made a diagram which you can look at on mylimbo under “Local”. Well thats all I have to write for today. Until next entry.  - http://mylimbo.rawr32.net/forums/index.php
