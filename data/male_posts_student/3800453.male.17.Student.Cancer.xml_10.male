In the seventh grade, I used to go to this youth group with my friends, these skateboarder kids who were real badasses. They only attended it to steal otter pops, knock over chairs, and cause chaos during the games, so it was pretty fun.  It was located at the Calvery Chapel, a nice new church, all the people there were cool and friendly, so i liked it.  Eventually i started singing the songs in worship, and later playing the piano for them.           Anyways, I kept this weekly ritual up for years, and in high school the skateboarder kids stopped going.  I continued to go though, and was pretty good friends with Justin, the "good" kid I knew from school and the youth group.  Justin had a girlfriend named Whitney.  I had known Whitney from my old school, in Chimicum. I attended school there in grades 2-4, then moved to Port Townsend.  Later during middle school Whitney moved also, and thats about the time they started going out.           So every once in a while, the youth group would go on a trip somewhere and the kids could come, but usually it costed money.  During my freshman year in high school, I was informed that they were planning on attending the 4-5 day long Creation 2002 Festival, at the Gorge in summer.  I had heard about how fun it was the year before.  It costed somewhere around $110, but my parents decided to pay for it because, you know, it was church-oriented and all.           The group that was going had to get an early start for the four hour ride to the Gorge.  You could choose either to spend the night at the church, or to arrive early and catch the church vans.  Most of us stayed the night                                                                            CHAPTER 2          In the church, the girls were to sleep in the room where the sevice is held, and the guys were to sleep in this other room that the youth group sometimes sang in.  I didn't want to sleep yet, as it wasn't really late, so I hopped up on the piano, I don't think anyone minded... eventually i had a small audience.  So, as I was playing mozart with my eyes closed, a girl sat next to me on the bench.  She was attractive, had short pink hair and had brought some hair dye apparently, as she was asking if she could dye mine.  I told her that i hadn't really done anything to my hair before, it was just plain ol' straight brown and floppy.   I started giving in, asking how long it lasted, etc... next thing i knew, I was too into my piece, that she had already gotten the dye and started to put it in my hair.  It was late, and it would wash out, so I just let her do it.  Before i went to bed, I went to brush my teeth in the bathroom.   When I looked in the mirror, i noticed that my hair looked like a big tongue licked it, and it had strange tints of pink and green or blue in it.  I washed it out, dried it then went to bed.  That was my first of many experiences with this girl...          The next morning, we all had to wake up early, load up the vans, and ride the four hours to the Gorge.  I rode with Justin, Whitney, and the girl i had met the night before.  Some tried to catch up on some sleep on the way there, and i decided to do so as well.  I couldnt find a really comfortable position to sleep in, so it kinda sucked.  We made a few bathroom breaks and bought some snacks that we ate on the way there, and finally arrived.            The weather at the Gorge was about 100 degrees, but we had plenty of nice water to drink or splash each other with.  We set up camp at our site, then conversed with each other.  I was introduced to Alisha that day by Whitney and Justin, in fact, as I learned that Whitney and Alisha were stepsisters.  Alisha, I think it was, told me that she was just sent to hang out with me because Whitney wanted more alone time with my best friend then, Justin.  I laughed and said that he was always telling me about that...          Alisha asked if i would go in the mosh pit with her.  I'd never been in a mosh pit, but how bad could it get in a christian concert anyways, so it was the first thing the two of us did. Another guy named Travis came along too, who was friends with Alisha.  Pretty cool guy. I don't exactly remember what was playing in the mosh pit, but I remember that Alisha wanted to go to the front and would push through people to get right in front of the stage.  I, on the other hand, was always considerate and polite of others.. unless peer pressure was involved.  So Alisha reached out, implying that she wanted to pull me through the other people, so i took her hand and she pulled me on through, all the way to the front.  I sorta liked her.  We did this every day when we were in the crowd.  Another thing Alisha and I did was steal this caution tape and make sashes and belts and always sit and walk together.  The youth group people called us the "caution king and caution queen".  It was really fun.  Alisha even spiked my hair one day, it was so awesome just being different that day.          About halfway through the festival, I still remember it was July 26th, Travis asked me if i liked Alisha, and I said yeah.  He asked if he wanted help getting us together, I said that would be great, as all of my previous attempts with girls had failed...  So he asked her if she would go out with me if I were to ask, and she said she would.  Travis didn't recommend that I ask her though.  Anyways, I went ahead and asked her in some sort of dorky manner... She said yes, and I was very pleased.  We sat together that night at around 2 am, looked at the stars, and talked.  Eventually we decided to go to bed.         The next day, we moshed around, ate food, and all that good stuff.  Around 10-11, when it was dark, we were still down in the main stage, deep within all of the people... There was a PDA rule that i never really thought I'D break, but a slow song came on and I put my arms around her waist.  She responded by holding onto both of my hands, and we rocked... Her hair smelled so nice, and it was so warm in there.  I kissed her on the cheek sometime during all of that.  We did this for the remaining 1-2 days that were left of the whole thing.         It was finally time to go home, and by now it was probably obvious that we had a thing for each other.  Since Alisha and I had stayed up late the night before, and had woken up early that morning, we were both really tired, and she decided to sleep the whole way home.  She put a pillow on my lap, and just conked out.  Someone offered me a pillow, since I also wanted to sleep, and I slept on it against the window.  I remember that that moment was the most that I had felt loved in my life.  Before that, I couldn't sleep in a car since this truck accident I was in when I was 8.                                                                                    CHAPTER 3         Sometime during the trip, I had found out that Alisha had recently moved in about two blocks away from me.  This was convenient.  We visited each other often, I got to know her family, etc... At the time, it was early in August, and the nights there were very clear and warm.  I called her and we planned to sneak out, because we weren't really allowed to be alone together, due to her "bad" past.  I knew the area pretty well, so i could show her around and we could talk.  It's all I really planned on doing.          We set up a time and met about halfway, on this trail between our houses, at about 1 in the morning.  She had brought a blanket which was an excellent idea, as I chose to go to this field I knew of behind an elementary school.  As we walked up there, you could hardly see the stars until you really got further into the field, because of the lights in the parking lot at the school.  We found a place to set the blanket down, and sat on it.  There, we talked for a couple hours, and really got to know each other.  Eventually it got to the point where I told her that I had never really kissed a girl, so soon enough, we were making out and all that fun stuff.  That night, I saw a shooting star hit the atmosphere and explode, but she was looking down on me, and not at the sky so all she saw was a flash.  It was pretty awesome.          We snuck out two more times, the second time, my brother and his friend tried to spy on us.  Sigh.. dumb brother.  So Alisha and I were talking not really about anything, and we heard this "CRASH, CRASH, CRASH......scrunch scrunch.."  I knew immediately it was my brother and his friend, and to make it even more obvious, there was a flashlight beaming around in every direction.  Alisha and I got up and ditched them, to go to the roof of the school instead.  We laid the blanket down, and I think i had brought one along too, and put it over us to stay warm.  Did the same stuff we did the night before, it was cool.           The third time we snuck out, Alisha wasn't really sure if we should, because her mom was starting to catch on, and if she were to get caught they would send her to some correction school or something, far away.  When we went out to the field, we saw numerous more shooting stars, and when I was looking directly into her eyes, they lit up bright white, followed by her face, hair, the field, then the trees surrounding us, bright as daylight for a couple seconds.  She just saw a star explode like the one I had seen before, and commented on something like how amazing it was.              After a while, I kept trying to keep in touch with her, but usually never could.  About a week after we snuck out, she called and told me she was sneaking out and going to Fort Warden with her old friends from Chimicum. She told me she was going to get really wasted and smoke. I was very dissatisfied, as I had always stayed away from the stuff, and we sort of mutually decided that it was best if I stayed home.              The night finally came that she told me about, and she said she would see me the next day at the youth group.  I didn't see her the next day at the youth group, and after waiting at the athletic club with the group for about an hour, I asked my friend Justin if he had any clue where Alisha was.  He was sort of acting strange and told me to ask Whitney.  I knew something was up.  I asked Whitney where Alisha was and she said that she got caught sneaking out the night before and was going to be sent to a boarding school somewhere in a different state.  I looked out the window and silently cried the rest of the way back to the church.           This sucked more than anything else for me, but to make things worse, I later found out from their mom that she slept with some guy that night.  Yeah it was hell for me then.  Her family let me spend the night at their house that night because I was so sad.  I remember crying myself to sleep, and waking up crying.  How fun.           So, I felt that I really needed to talk to Alisha, and hear the story from her, but I just couldn't get ahold of her.  She wasn't allowed to talk with anyone at all, and was staying at her grandparent's house until she left for the school in Texas.  Two weeks after not being able to talk with her, I saw her online.  Her grandpa was angry at her dad for his choice, and let her on the computer for a while.  We talked for a while and I had some questions to ask her... She denied all of the bad stuff that I heard happened.  I later found out from a couple people that she had been seeing this other guy, as I suspected.  Since then, I had really found a strong disliking for lies, and commited myself to being honest as often as possible from then on.             Eventually, I saw her online the night before she had to leave.  I needed to see her for one last time, before she left for almost a year.  My brother's friend, Jacob decided to drive the distance out to chimicum, and was even late for work, but I saw her for a disappointing five more minutes before she shut the door in my face, probably only partially due to an angry grandmother in the background of the doorway.  It was pretty heartbreaking, but I was still glad I saw her that last time.             For the first few months after that, I prayed for her every night and I thought about her every day.  I wondered if she still loved me.  I wondered if she ever did.  I wrote many emails and letters to her that I tried sending every way I could, but none of them were permitted to reach her.  So I waited for the longest 10 months of my life, when I finally found out that she came back.                                                                                                CHAPTER 4           When Alisha came back, her family was no longer living in the same town as me.  Even though she was home again, I still couldn't see her for a couple more months.  The next time I saw her was actually at Creation Fest 2003.  Her family said I could come with them that time, because the youth group didn't go that year, and I accepted.  I had no clue what to expect.          The time came and they picked me up in a van in the afternoon, a day before the Concert started.  We planned on staying in a hotel.  So we arrived at the hotel after a couple hours and were assigned rooms.  I saw Alisha for the first time in a year then, and boy was she looking more beautiful than ever.  Her hair was longer and brown, instead of bleach blond with pink dye.  She had a nice tan now too.  We just kind of exchanged glances at each other every now and then, not knowing what to expect from the other.  After a short while, we went to bed in our seperate rooms.          The next day, I was anxious to see Alisha.  We didn't talk much until after we set up camp.  We sort of talked like nothing really happened.  It was just easier that way.  We ended up becoming more and more friends with each other, we played cards, laughed, joked, even designed some more accessories with stolen caution tape.  Eventually the time came again when it was dark, and the slow music was played again, like a familiar memory.  I was close by Alisha and as our small group was headed closer and closer to the stage, the people became more concentrated, until we were packed in there nice and tight.  I was making pretty close contact with her and later throughout the night, I decided to just take my chances and put my arms around her to hold her.  She then, like before, put her hands over mine, and we rocked slowly to the music. How great it was to have a moment with her again...           We had a great time at Creation, and the time came when we had to go home.  After that, we never really saw each other because school had started, and unfortunately, when she switched to Port Townsend High, I started living with my dad in Gig Harbor so I could only really visit my old town during long breaks.  So I dedicated winter break to going back to my old town to see my old friends again.  By chance, I saw Alisha, and we hugged and talked and all that.  I don't really remember if i was comfortable around her or not then, but it was nice seeing her.           That was the last time I saw her until this summer, and between now and then, we kept in touch with the messenger.  At one time or another, she apologized for what she did.  I was so happy and relieved, and felt a bit lighter.  Also, I found in one of my email folders, that I had actually saved one of the letters I had written to her, read it through, then sent it to her, hoping she would like it.  She said it was very sweet.  I ended up getting her cell phone number before I found out I was visiting my mom back in town, and we arranged to see each other.           You can find the 5th chapter of my story in the earlier posts in my blog.  Hope you enjoyed reading this. Phew.
