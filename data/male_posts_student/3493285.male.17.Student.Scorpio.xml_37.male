DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL WAS THE BEST. one of the best nights of my life. (thanks melody, devin and jenny!! you guys rock!) cant think of a place i'd rather have been last night. AHH i want it again.  also, new episodes of Degrassi start friday. cant wait to have the PREMEIRE (thats a hard word to spell) party with the Degrassi Crew. Page, Terry, Ashley, Manny, and Hazel. oh wait hazel's not invited. (lol i hope you read this moose).   Okay now i'm really going to school.
