I didn't even want to stop since I ate so much last night, but my arms and legs started shaking and I knew I wouldn't last until 7 tonight.  I couldn't believe how shaky I was, it was getting worse the closer to my place I got.  On the way, I had considered doing an all cereal food regime since it would control my calories really well (one box per day is about 2000 calories).  Well, I'd need to be sure its a low sugar high fiber cereal, because the cereal I had this morning made me so hungry and shaky by noon I couldn't do that every day.  Cat enjoyed me being home for just a couple minutes.  I don't know how she's going to handle me being on vacation for two weeks.  It will be so lonely. :(  Maybe Cindy and Laura can take turns staying with her?  So my mother IMed me and was telling me about her dentist visit today.  She goes to my dentist too, and since I went yesterday they were raving over how wonderful a person I was:   Mom : I went for my cleaning this morning and they were all oohing and ahhing about what a nice young man you are  Mom : they said you were every mother's dream of a son in law  Mom : I said does that mean he didn't cause a scene and throw a fit?  Mom : they LOVE you  Mom : even Mr Dr thakrar said he saw you and what a nice fellow you were.  Mom : I said that you took after your mother  Mom : I did hear she was a nice person  My mom makes me laugh sometimes.  I can't even go to the dentist without being harassed, if even a day late!  So I opened my new money market account and put my six months saved income into it.  You're supposed to have nine, so we'll see how that goes.  It has a 2.15% interest rate and its harder to get to than a checking/savings account, so we'll see how that goes.  Mom was telling me about all the wonderful (read expensive) things we'll be doing out in CA for two weeks.  Dodger's game, boat trip to Catalina Island, San Diego zoo.  Should be fun.  I have to water all my plants.. eek.. two weeks, so much goes on during two weeks.  And I'm going to be away....  After helping my mom with my uncle's website, she wrote:  Mom : you are the best!  Mom : but I already knew that because the dentist's office told me this morning.  Something to make me smile. :)  Also, Sheila called and wants to go to Golden Port tonight at 6:15, so that's something to look forward to.
