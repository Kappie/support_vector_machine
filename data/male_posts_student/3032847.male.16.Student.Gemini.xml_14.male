Looks like the manky stray cat which me grandad took in ages ago, and is still manky, is going on its last journey at half five, to the vet...  Anyway its THE WEEKEND! :-D... :-O Chemistry revision, maths revision, english revision.. damn, blast, curse  set fire to it :-@  Two weeks today I'll have walked out of the last exam and into the 'bright sunny day with blue sky and fluffy white clouds' (weather report on the proposed day courtisy of Mr Malcolm)
