"Anything for Excitement" happens to be the title of an original composition, lyrics by Amanda, piano, guitar, and vocals parts written by me. I'm the one with music theory training. I won't post the lyrics up here since they're under copyright protection (lol), and if you want them, don't ask me. As of now, it's a ballad in B flat minor, for anyone who knows what the hell I'm talking about. Should be fun-I haven't done any composing in a while, so I'll see what happens.  Oh, and btw: the bari-sax kicks a$$!
