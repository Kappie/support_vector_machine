Ya, I really have no interesting stories to tell today, it was pretty uneventful, except the fact that I NOW HAVE A JOB AT MCDONALDS!!!!  but that's about it....other than that, my life is pretty uneventful. I did notice one thing though....WHY DO YOU PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TINA SO MUCH?!?!?!?!  seriously, if you talk about her to others as much as you do talking to me, you guys have sum serious issues...I really don't kare to hear or talk about her frankly, so, just treat it like a normal subject.  That is all. Peace, and for Keli, love.*not that I don't love you people...it's just that I love her more :-D  Spense
