I don't really know why but I just want to cry my eyes out, just a little while ago I was feeling really good and like I was ready to take on the world. Now, however, I feel like going into my room locking the door and sleeping all weekend and shutting myself out from the world. I know I shouldn't feel like this and I don't why I do but I do. I don't know anymore...
