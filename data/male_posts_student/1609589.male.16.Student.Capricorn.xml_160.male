There was a stack of moveable chairs, and i blew em up with a grenade, but i didnt know that there were explosives under the chairs, so the whole room blew up. Good times.  Oh, and before I go, if you actually care that the cowboys lost the game, please go jump off a cliff. I don't want your blubbering shit talking to me about how we lost. I don't care. I know it's hard for some of you to accept, but... i really don't give a flying taco.  By the way, i've decided that Taco is the best word ever.
