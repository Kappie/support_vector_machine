Neways HOW HARD IS BLOODY WORK EXPERIENCE! alot in my case. im sure all you people who are pushing pencils would disagree but my jobs really tiring. But i get paid so thats all my complaining.  alot of films are out at the moment arent there, yes, o glad u agree (talking to yourself 1st sign of madness (getting an answer 2nd sign)). i think i remember sumone saying about our group going up to see sumthing 1 day, i havent been told anything more though.  hmmm... anything else i can depress you people with? o, i remember, not depressing but anyway, HAPPY BIRTHDAY HIPPY!!! hope you liked the cheese.  so ill leave you now to go drink my troubles away (though we've ran out of drink so im using applejuice)  byby
