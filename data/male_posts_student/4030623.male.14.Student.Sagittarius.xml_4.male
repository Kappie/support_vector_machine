I haven't decided where my future lies!I haven't thought about this, yet I haven't got a clue what course will I take in college? This thought bothered me for a while, then I gave up, Maybe, I think I'm too occupied with the current ongoings that I haven't even seriously considered where will I be in the next stage of life?  BUt then this thought really bothered me, and I guess, Elaine, this answers your question?  Then, something in our English exam a while ago took my attention....  THE VALUES OF EDUCATION....  "You don't recieve education for the purpose of being rich and everything, but you recieve education just to be fit in life"  "Not everybody can be the president, yet everyone does want that position, nobody wants to ba a janitor/janitress when he/she grows up, yet we need them in our society, nobody wanted to be a criminal or a terrorist when they grow up, yet, in this world we are living in, so many terrorist are existing...."  Right?  and others I already forgotten, but, yeah, I really agree with that author, he/she has the same point of view in life as mine.....  What about you guys there?  Decided on what course to take upon in college?  Ever dreamt of being a janitor?  Ever dreamt of helping others while sacrificing yourself?  Or are you just dreaming of your own individual interest only?  Come on, open your eyes to the world!  Wake up!  dmendell bloggin out
