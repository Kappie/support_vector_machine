It has been nice living like Chris for a few days, but tomorrow I vow to return to the real world.    Today I went shopping in St. Cloud, and spent some money. I got these things at Electric Fetus and Barnes and Noble:  Refused- Shape of Punk to Come  The Essential Clash  Don't Call Me Ska Face- Volumes 1 + 3  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones- Let's Face It  Bad Religion- The Empire Strikes First (vinyl)  Tiger Army- Tiger Army 3: Ghost Tigers Rise! (vinyl)  Lars Fredrickson and the Bastards- Viking (vinyl)  Wesley Willis- The Daddy of Rock and Roll DVD  Two books: One about the history of punk, and one by the author of  Fast Food Nation , but I can't remember the names right now.    John got some DVDs, and Bryce got some pants and  Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick .    I'm really tired, because I was at Bryce's house last night and I barely slept at all because I felt sick.    After St. Cloud, I stuck those CDs on my iPod. Now, sleep.    good night
