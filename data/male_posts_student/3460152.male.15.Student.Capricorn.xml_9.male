I went to school today (As always) and was suprised to gain insight that I was nominated for an achievers break! This is where 20 people from the year get nomiated to go to the have a 'snack' of dougnuts and biscuits accompanied with drinks to celebrate your achievements in a particular area of school. This time it was because of our yearly reports and how well we did in them!  Anwayz the most unusual part of the day is yet to come. Third lesson was English and at this moment in time I HATE English. What I am about to write involves a teacher and our class but I will refrain from naming the teacher for obvious reasons! As me and my mate were at the achievers break we came into lesson late. We both sat down and listened to the teacher who was rambling on about how our work was not up to standard (As the week before we had a cover teacher because our teacher was at this ceremony thing to say goodbye to the year 11's). Anywayz as that day last week was 'special' because the year 11's were leaving we got out of lesson 15 minutes early! As the lesson started late we did not have enough time to do all the work (Which involved copying a whole page from the OHP as well as doing 8 detailed questions - which in my opinion is impossible!) Anyway back to the point after she lectured us about our work (As we are the 'top-set' and could do better) I stood up to our evil teacher and told her that we only had 45 mins to do the work and that it wasn't really our fault. Other people backed me and I felt good that we all united together to stand in what we fought for!  This is not really the unusual bit, but what I am going to write next is! The teacher started to argue with us and then snapped. She started to really get hyped up and told us she was leaving as she had had enough of our school! She then picked on this boy (Who will not be named) and started to say that the reason why she was leaving was because of people like him. She then went on to say stuff to make her sound 'big headed' like "This school will miss me and my expertise" and other crap like that. She started to get really 'hyped' up that she nearly began to cry! To cut a long story short she send this boy (That she always picks on) out of the room and we all started to protest! He hadn't done anything wrong but express his feelings, but by her account he HAD done something wrong.  The thing which I found unusual was what she did next. As quick as a flash she acted like nothing happened and started to teach the lesson 'normal'. I hate people that are like that who have split personalities and also people that pick on other people. It's just not fair! In my personal opinion I am glad that she is leaving tomorrow and can't wait for our new teacher :)  Anywayz I will post more later on tonight!  Bye!  Stefan
