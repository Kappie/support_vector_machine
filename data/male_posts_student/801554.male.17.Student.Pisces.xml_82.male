"We don't need martyrs right now. We need heros. A hero will die for his country, but he'd much rather live for it."  On a completly unrelated note, I'm reading George Orwell's  1984 . Brilliant work.  "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."  And to conclude my post-o-quotes, here's Herodutus:  "Call no man happy untill he is dead."  /ponder.
