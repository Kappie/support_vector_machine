(starting from last night)    (1) Shu ting PS my bio 'save-your-grade' class (2) saw 2 very interesting couples. (3) heard a kid being whacked (very badly) on my way home. (these are more thought evoking) (4) did my mission statement this afternoon (5) first time tutoring someone.. sorta. (6) bought some games, yay. (7) dexter came over, talked cock, taught him html crap, and eating geylang tau hua together. (8) got very pissed off at home. (9) rest are secrets, so go away. (10) some interesting stuff i did to TRY make this blog more.. interesting.. (11x) the afterthoughts and ACTUAL blog.    thats about it. i suppose. *glances* yep, thats it i think.    oh and prepare yourself, this blog is gonna be  DAMN  long.. (thats the reason why i numbered them, makes your life easier or u can skip to stuff that interests you more.) so grab some snacks and maybe a drink... visit the loo if you have to.  for most of the numbered sections.. they are more or less jus my recap of the day. if you wanna skip it, jus hit ctrl+f and type in "(11x)" without the quotes ("  "). That's more of the main body with my feelings, thoughts and all the nice sentimental stuff. (if you are actually into it that is.)    with that aside... *cracks knuckles* here we go!    (1) Shuting called after i came back from school.. wanted to talk on phone with someone then she ask i free anot, ever being oh-so-nice i told her im free. (when im actually not that free, supposed to do project). fast forward abit.. when i walking to compass point.. then i msg her telling her i coming.. that was when she reply "i half asleep, forgot to tell u, sorry, test postpone to friday." yeah i was having the -.- face. then she said treat ice cream or something.. i was too lazy to be bother with ice cream by then.. since i was at CP, i was tasked with 2 errands, top up my mom's ezlink and pay bills... the SAM didnt like my mom's OCBC card.. after i reported to her, she figured its the bank, SAMs like POSB... weird. aint they all NETS? (wah so many terms, fun sia ^^)  and yes, i forgot that CP had an M1 shop.. i know, its dumb.    (2) on my way back.. i saw 2 very interesting couples. One, was a couple.. with the gal having her arm linked with her other half. spouses they are. its very obvious. Cause they are 70-80 years old (gotcha there didnt i? and yes my eyes were wide open, believe me.) and they were still chatting nicely, having a nice slow stroll at like 9pm? and look blissful. i stared at them cause i was very curious.. afterthoughts in (11x) so please bear with me. (get envious anyone? =P) The other couple was a guy on the bike with the gal sitting on the frame of the bike.. an MTB. Don't worry, these pair were in their mid 20s. (you sickening idiots want a poor 80 year old chap to have a heart attack is it!?)    (3) On the kid being whacked.. its when i was walking past Seng Kang Primary, i heard it from some unit above me.. it sounded horrible.. the cane brings back memories of mine u know.. and some dumb kid flashed a laser at me.. u dun wanna know wat i did after that.. it isn't polite, trust me. =P     (4) mission statement.. it is some dumb thing i must do cause of a nice little core subject at temasek poly called Applied Principles of Effective Learning - APEL for short. its jus a nice little draft of wats impt to me, simply.    (5) after that... dear jia qi PS me.. (gotta get used to it) and i waited in vain for her.. rebecaa was visibly upset too.. AND it had to rain the moment i got outta poly... got TOTALLY drenched. great. i had to rush to Ang Mo Kio to tutor someone after that too.. (details are confidential so dont ask, yan ling knows the details cause....) after that, i had dinner with yan ling.. yay! =D    (6) of course.. since i was in amk.. i stumbled over to central to buy some games.. games includes armored core 3 for PS2, and the sims: hot date for my sis.. im such a good brother. i love my sis too. (xiao mei i love you too so dun jealous k? =P)    (7) on bus 86, and somewhere near yio chu kang station, i recieved a call from dexter, thats nice. wanted to come over to ask me some html stuff.. his coursework, of course i welcomed him over and he stayed awhiel.. taught him, ate tau hua that my dad bought, and of course screw around a little.    (8) as for getting pissed off.. i supposed its an accumulation of the day ba. sorry AGAIN to 'you-know-who-you-are' for getting angry at you. My most sincere apologies.    (9) self-explainatory. can only tell CERTAIN ppl these things =P (so go away lol)  (10) as for stuff i did to this blog... added a description.. blah.. added some links to my friends' blogs... blah.. and if you have not noticed, end of every blog, i throw in a R.P.S, stands for Random Please See.. jus a random note of some unusual knowledge or jus something funny or i feel like saying.. if u want to share something do it through the comments (which reminds me, i have my first comment done by sok feng =D) or jus throw me a line, contacts to the right. if u want my handphone number... mail or msg me and ill see if i can give it to you or not, alternatively, ask around. (or ask me, in the end. =X) im gonna see wat else i can do with this. or one fine day i jus do alot of html editing.    and finally....     drumroll............     (11x) the MAIN part of the blog... well... i dunno how long it will be actually.. depends how much i can think of actually..   well.. maybe ill jus crap around about the stuff i saw.. its more fun anyway. Seriously, how many people do you see, after marriage, still hug each other in their sleep? Link hands where ever they go? give a quick peck to the cheek on occasions in public? or have fun all the time, everywhere? maybe not even feeding each other, having strolls, doing simple things like providing jackets tissues umbrellas or opening doors for her. i find it quite saddening you know.. you are supposed to love him/her so much yet the relationship 'colds' towards the end. That is actually alot of reason why many people is afraid of jumping into one.  but then again, look at the elderly couple.. they happily express their feelings for each other. As for the biking couple.. would u actually still do such things AFTER courtship? or AFTER marriage? hardly. that couple was married, i saw the rings :)  people often do now know the power of words.. if they really love someone and say it out to themselves facing a mirror, and say "i will make sure i love -insert lover's name here- forever and make sure that we will be a loving couple till the end." chances are, it will happen ^^ cause you told yourself, and u will   work   towards  MAKING  it happen. fate can bring a couple together.. but they must forge their own destiny.. (u are most welcomed to comment on this part)  Express yourself openly if you have to. If you dislike say.. fish, express it openly or people might get the wrong idea. Same with feelings. expressing feelings will also, in a sense, let you face the music.. u already said/expressed it out, u cannot run away from this fact. Once you embrace it, that fact will become a part of you and grow with u.. (i dislike coffee.. and it grew to me disliking tea too lol)    PERSONALLY , i do not believe in sitting there and expecting things to happen.. (part of the reason why im a free thinker.) i go out and make sure it happens, or i dun expect it at all. And as for saying that scentence to myself, i already did it :) and it is already affecting the way some things are done. =P *ahem! DAR~ling! ahem!*  I sound like either some guy that fell outta love or some love/marriage counselor. =X  Here is a extract of something im listening to now.     when i fall in love, im falling in love..     nothing in this world can take you away~     when i fall in love, im falling in love~     baby i want u to know i am always here to stay~           cause when i hold u close     to me i cant let you go     i want to know you well     i want to let you know     cause when i hear your voice     i know i wont let go     cause my love for you is real     so baby please dont go.         this is a song i recently accuired =P nice lyrics huh? it really got me thinking about the above.. pretty interesting you know ^^ pretty meaningful if u link it to the couples above.. maybe u might wanna think abt such incidents that relates to you.. *i am linking this song to someone/thing/watever now ^^* reminds me of something. like some people's parents i know of that are so loving.. heh.. even if they are from different worlds.. too bad my parents aint loving.  I think this blog is long enough.. hope you didnt fall asleep halfway reading it all =P   if you want to read more wait for the next blog =P          P.S : Told you this blog was long.. believe me now? =P  P.P.S : This blog took me quite some time to write.. i had to save it many times.. i also written it in many locations.. like the com labs in TP, or at home.. (in between breaks)  R.P.S : Did you know writing blogs help relieve some stress? I love writing too also. (That's why i write it =P)
