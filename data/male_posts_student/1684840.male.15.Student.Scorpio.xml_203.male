Craig invited me round to watch a movie and we had a laugh.  Sam turned up and went again soon after.  I went home around half past four and Shell and Mum were in the garden.  It's been a really cool day.  The approval has settled in now and we're rushing into the school holidays like there's no tomorrow    Can't wait to go to France next week and then have a couple of days in London to go sightseeing.  Lots of photo oppertunities!  This week at school is going to be interesting.  The first three days are just dossing around so t'will be fun
