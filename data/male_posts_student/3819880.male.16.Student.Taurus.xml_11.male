I'm taking a course on learning how to use the program 3d Studio Max.  It's fun.   Okay, now that I mentioned all of that, I can write something more interesting.  Unfortunately, there is a problem.  There really isn't anything interesting to write about  So I guess I'll ramble on about camp some more.   Just about everyone in the camp left today, so there are only 5 of us left (there were only about 20 people to begin with).  We have the same amount of freedom I had at camp last year...they don't really care where we are or what we do as long as we are at class when we're supposed to be and we're back at the dorm by 10:15.  Of course, this place doesn't compare to my experience at Explo in any way at all, because last year's Explo was the Jesus fucking Christ of summer camps.  On the other hand, I didn't come to camp this year for the same reason I went to camp last year; last year the focus of being there was the social aspect (although I was interested in the courses), but this year I am completely focused on learning the program, for it is of great importance that I know if I want to leap into the gaming industry when I am older (and knowing if I like this stuff or not will also help me determine my college major).  The food at the cafeteria here is sub-par, but food at any summer camp I've been to has always been like that (it may just be my mentality).  So, instead of forcing myself to perform the masochistic act of eating cafeteria food (even though its not freally masochisitic because there are no sexual implications associated with the eating of bad food), I have eaten just about all of my breakfasts at the cafe in the bookstore and I try to make eat either dinner or lunch at subway (but not both).  I think I use parentheses too much.  I mean, seriously, look over the last two paragraphs.  I used like 10 fucking parentheses or something.  I also enjoy throwing in random curse words, it makes me seem more like an angry, angsty teen, which you all know I am.  I'm also quite sarcastic when I type these things up, which may not be one of my brighter ideas seeing how I cannot type the inflections of my voice over the internet.  Hmm, well our resident dorm person, Lizette (I really like that name) (gah! parentheses!), went to rent us Euro Trip and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, so I'm going to end this now and go watch those with the 4 other dorm mates that I have.   Good night.  - Brian
