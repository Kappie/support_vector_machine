It just goes to show how effective company logos can be. Certain letters are more recognizable than others, so there were quite a few that I had to think about. Eventually I was able to get all of the 4th edition letters on my own, but I haven't gone through the older editions. The only thing is, the guy who created the game will only give you 4th edition answers at a hefty price--$8 per letter! Now there's a little encouragement to guess them on your own. (If anyone wants the answers I can post them in the comments)  Thanks to Darian for the link
