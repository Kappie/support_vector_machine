But I did feel obliged to check my grades, just to see how my tenure turned out.     CUMULATIVE UT WORK  36  24  36  96  4.0000   A's across the board.  One B in the past four years of my life; and it was fucking Health.  I don't have chlamydia; that should mean I get an A in that.    Too bad letters don't equate to success outside of college.  Maybe I can string some construction paper A's along my wall, to remind me of the glory that was my UT experience.  Or I can take more pictures of pedestrian bridges.
