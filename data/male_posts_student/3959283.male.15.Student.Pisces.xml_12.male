He has no mercy, and he is fucking hilarious.    I saw his biography of a movie, and it was pretty interesting.    He started with nothing, to having naked people on the air.    He went from a loser with a white mans fro to a pimp with long hair and John Lennon glasses.    He is the American dream right there.     When I was in Florida I was eating at a Ponderosa.    After I gave the waiter my order, he took one look at me and said with this thick Jamaican accent, “Ya kno, you gotta deep voice.    You gonna be the nex Howard Stern.”    My mom had a look of shock.    My dad laughed.    My brother was confused.    I just said thank you and laughed.    I think that waiter is on to something.     A lot of the people I know, and a lot of the people I don’t know are always saying I’m gonna be famous.    They don’t know how I’m gonna become famous but they just know I will be.    The other day a hair stylist (not the one who fucked up my hair, but same place) said to my mom in a Chinese accent, “yo son es goin to be famous.    He goin be presiden someday.”    I said I’d rather be an actor and she said, “ yeah yo right.    You look like you could be nex Brad Pit.”    I took the compliment and left.    Also…people always call me by my last name, or by my full name.    I asked them why they do that, and they say it’s because I know your gonna be famous, and when people talk about famous people they always use their full name or last name.     I think I just have wishful thinking, but it’s fun to wish :)
