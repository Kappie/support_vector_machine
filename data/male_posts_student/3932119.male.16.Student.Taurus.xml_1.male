I was in this program for 4 days. It was a three hour drive down there. When I got there I went up to my dorm and found out I had 2 room mates (Paden and Will). Obviously I had no idea what these 2 guys were like. I was the first to arrive so I just sat in the prison like dorm. After about half an hour Will finally showed up. He looked liked an easy going guy and he was really cool to talk to. Then cam Paden, a short scrawny,pale, guy who paced around all over the place and had a Star Trek T-shirt......enough said. I mean this guy would change in the closet. Hes one of those guys who always went into the stall in the guys locker room because he felt insecure about himself or something. The first day was long and boring speech by this guy named Steve Anderson, some sort of motivational speaker. The second day was a bit more interesting when I met the guys who were dormed next door to me, will, and paden. Their names were Patrick and Luke. Patrick came straight from Chicago suburbs and Luke was a pyrofrom Ocala Florida. The four of us (Pat,Me,Will, and Luke) all became good friends during the course of the program. The 2nd and 3rd day this goth girl named Marianna seemed to follow me around (apparently she was obssessed with me...just my luck). Anyway since I'm nice I talked to her and listened to her dispite the teasing from Pat. The 4th day she asked "Does witchcraft scare you?" and I responded "No, because personally I think its bullshit and not real." At the time she was talking to her friend Jackie on her cell phone. I said "If witchcraft is real then you can curse me." Well, her friend on the phone said she was a witch and that her and marianna had this coven of witchs and they did do curses and "spells" together. So then Marianna says " Ok, but I will need a bit of your hair and a article of your clothing that you have had for over a month." At this point I kind of laughed and got some some of my hair out with a knife and then gave her a plain grey shirt I had had for awhile. I guess if I start to cry blood or anything then witchcraft is real. The last day we had a awards ceremony, you know, one of those things where you get called up if you did something special or stood out in some way. Anyway, this guy named Sean had a accoustic guitar and was playing it into the mic before the awards started, then he asked the crowd "Are there any other guitar players out there?" and of course everyone pointed to me because I had already told people about my band. So I went up there and played a Tenacious D song (Kielbasa)and a Red Hot Chili Peppers song (Californiacation...is the spelling right on that?). After I was done I got a huge applause and everyone stood up and clapped and yelled. After that everyone gave me notes saying how cool it was and how "awesome" I was on guitar. I played infront of about 100 people so I guess its kind of like a gig. Anyway I had a good time dispite the occasional moments of boredom from speakers.
