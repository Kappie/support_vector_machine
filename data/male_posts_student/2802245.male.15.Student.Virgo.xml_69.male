I'll just cycle to the park... nah, prob full of mo- how about the corner shop - nah, prob full of- erm, the lake? prob full o- eerm, erm, the local roundabout? prob ful- AGH why the hell are the annoying bas***ds running the area?!  Anyway, did some more on the flash. Go to my other blog to see a small gif anim :)  Too bad, I'll leave this half typed and go outside anyway.   After...   Back - just went to the park, only a wee m00k3 there, better than I thought. Sorta cycled in loops, got bored and tried some wheelies and some other crap and *nearly* fell off. [note to self - do not try a BMX biker for a career] Then i hit the curb at high speed and fell off. I was like " holy ****! ", but lucky landed okay on the grass, as I twisted around with my n1nja speed and skillz (correction: uber lucky to land not too badly, although on my knees which dont look too healthy, being wrecked and bloody). Grr, must not wear shorts when cycling next time :/ My left hand is sore cos it smacked off a tree quite fast. Whos the stupid retard who planted it there anyways? Overall, a good trip nonetheless, the pain flows, but it does some good >:)    Tribute to thy retardedbastardwhoplantedthytreeness,  Jamie
