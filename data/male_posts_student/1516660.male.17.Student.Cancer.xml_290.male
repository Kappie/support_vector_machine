I came online for a while, then went to help my mother mop the floor. I realized that the kitchen floor gets so dirty easily. just now, Father asked if I mopped the floor. I went to look at the kitchen floor. OH MY GOD! There were dark patches here and there!!! I mopped of ALL dark patches! It is like not mopping like that leh. Ergh!  Anyway, I finished at 12, so I went to play FFX while eating my lunch. I only played a short segment, where Tidus, LuLu and Kimahri rescued Yuna from the Al Bheds. That took me about 40 minutes. I was running very late! HaHaHa.  At 1, when I was supposed to meet them, I wasn't even on the bus! They suddenly called and told me that they are meeting me on the MRT. Well, I finally did meet them, SL, Joyce and WQ. We took the train towards Boon Lay, going to Jurong Point.  HaHa. You can say that we spent a lot of time in there before buying Gloria's prezzie. HaHa. We walked and walked and look at a lot of cute stuff. We finally decided on our prezzie. Me, Joyce and SL paid for it. HeHe. I cannot reveal, because Gloria might be reading. After prezzie buying, we went to eat at KFC, walk around and went home.  HaHa. After bathing, I played FFX. I lost in my first BlitzBall tournament. HaHa. My brother says I am stupid. Well, I let him win for me lor. See if he can or not. I am also detecting a close relationship between Wakka and LuLu. O.o!!   Hmmm..after that I ate dinner and came online. I was greeted by a disturbing sign. WQ ar.... don't let these comments get to you, okay? I did not regret my decision in any bit. It was worth every single tries I went through. You are worth that. Don't let these comments affect you at all. Okay?   I end this le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
