Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes left the world of the living yesterday after a fatal car crash in Honduras....  I was a big TLC fan....I can't front....I am also a lifelong Falcons fan.....so the Left Eye and Andre Rison saga was a big deal to me.....I remember when they duked it out in front of Club Flava in the Dec....and I remember when they got arrested in the grocery store parking lot....they were the first large scale dysfunctional couple that I knew about....I told a few house burning jokes....but I admired the way she took it all in stride (crazy as she was).....I had a crush on her first (before I jumped on the whole Chilli/Tatyana Ali theme that has dominated most of my post pubescent years)....overall I dug Left Eye....I was interested in what moves she was going to make with Death Row (probably something wack....but still)....more importantly....another Icon for our generation is lost....our parents had to deal with Jimi, Marvin, John Lennon, etc.....arguably deeper individuals (though they were all absorbed in negative aspects of life as well to some extent)....well, we have lost Pac, Biggie, Aaliyah, and now Left Eye....listening to "Waterfalls" will never be the same again....  One love Left Eye!
