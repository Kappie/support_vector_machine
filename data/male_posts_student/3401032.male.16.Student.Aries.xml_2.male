So, technically speaking: I didn’t get to post on Thursday. So, to fill you in on what happened Thursday: nothing. Ok, now on to today…Friday! Let me see… hmm… today… absolutely NOTHING happened. Well, in Athletics (Me, and most of my friends plus a bunch of other kids are actually in P.E., which is also called Non-Athletics) we played basketball. It was 6 boys against 5 girls. Now, I know that sounds unfair, but those girls are GOOD. So, technically it was fare. So, when the game was half way over, the girls started complaining because we were actually winning. It was 12 to 0, so the coach was like, “Okay, I’m gonna play on the girls’ team now. So, he started to play and when the game was over it was 22 to 18. The girls won. But, it was fun anyway. Kayci almost broke my neck during the game, but that’s okay. Tomorrow, I may go with Brandi to the mall for my sister’s birthday. That is another thing: Brandi is also friends with my 12 year old sister. Well, she is about to be 13, but still. I think that is so dumb, and it irks me. But oh well, who cares. So, I’m kind of new to this blog thing. I would really like some feedback. I wonder how I get that? Because unless I do start to get some, it’s kind of like I’m writing to myself. And THAT freaks me out. LOL, well anyways, I said the next post would be shorter, so I guess this is a good spot to end it. Well, until the next post, later!
