He knows his way in the dark, But mine is the way of the Lord, And those who follow the path of the righteous Will have their reward. And if they fall as Lucipher fell, The flame, the sword!  Stars, in your multitudes, Scarce to be counted, Filling the darkness with order and light, You are the sentinels, silent and sure, Keeping watch in the night, Keeping watch in the night. You know your place in the skies, You hold your course and your aim, And each in their season returns and returns, And is always the same. And if you fall as Lucipher fell, You fall in flame...  And so it has been, And so it is written, On the doorways to paradise, That those who falter, And those who fall, Will pay the price.  Lord, let me find him, That I may see him Safe behind bars, I will never rest till then, This I swear... This I swear by the stars!   Stars   From   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
