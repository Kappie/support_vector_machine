The script I'm writing at present calls for an 18 year old girl; I don't want a carbon-copy airhead like seen in American Pie, and I don't want a Nietzche-quoting bitch like in Ghost World.  So Claire Danes' portrayl of Angela is what I'm looking for.  I need episodes.  There is ice and snow on the ground; conditions are going to get worse, but it's still slushy outside.  So I decide to go pick up two episodes at the only video store in Austin that rents this: Vulcan Video.  I call, ask how long they're going to be open...they'll be open until midnight.  I warm up my car for 15 minutes, scrape the ice, and drive the three mile drive in 25 minutes.  As I get there, the guy is locking up.  "You closed?" I ask, quoting Captain Obvious.  "Yeah," he says.  "I just called you, you said you'd be open until midnight," I say.  "Things change," he says.  I pause.  I busted my ass to get out here for this damn video.  "Could you let me rent something?  I know exactly what I need.  You said you'd be open."  He pauses.  "No."  And he walks away.  Today everything is shut and the roads are worse.  Fuck.       *The past four nights, I have gone to bed no earlier than 3:45.  The times have been:  3:45, 3:30, 4:00, and last night's big topper, 5:15.  Trying to get my clock back to waking up around 9 am is not happening; I missed half of Days of our Lives not because I was out of the house (how I like to miss it), but because I hadn't woken up yet.  Of course, Kerby Lane Cafe serves a mean cup of decaf and a great bowl of chips and salsa!  And trying to walk the ice in the bleak of night last night with Brian was a great experience.  At one point he stopped and said, "Look, a snowman!"  And sure enough, Brian stood over a snowman that couldn't've been more than 10 inches high.  He smiled.  Someone had put a lot of effort into making a very realistic snowman.  So Brian kicked it, and sent the top two thirds careening into the air. It was beautiful.       *On my way from my apartment to Starbucks, I saw two traffic accidents and at least three dozen people slip and fall on their asses.  I nearly was one more a few times; this ice is some crazy stuff.  One of the accidents was amusing, I hate to say...the truck was turning left, and just never really turned, so it fishtailed into a streetpole at about 8 mph.  A small dent to both, and a giggle from me.  I hope I'd laugh if it were my car.
