Only a bolt of lightning can stop me now... Or probably a good friend... I'm too bored, I feel like a total loser I know i'm not what i used to be but i think i might just go out... even for awhile Everyone i know keep telling me It's for the best... just relax... take a rest But after awhile, this room starts to bore me So i might just go out... i'm all done thinking Time to put some action into my thoughts
