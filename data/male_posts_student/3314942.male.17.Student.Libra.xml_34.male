Each had their own flair, and each played in a style which made the music that much better. Ben Folds was on fire, and he just looked like he was having too much fun... Rufus sang his heart out to the Boys of NYC, yes, to the boys. Guster played fantastically, and they really had the crowd's full attention.. it was great to be in such an enthusiastic audience...Guster and Ben Folds played Boy With the Arab Strap as an encore (by Belle and Sebastian), and Ben also played Late ( a tribute to Elliott Smith)...Ben kweller showed up at the end, and the last song topped EVERYTHING off...it was Ben Folds salsa version of a guster song..but it never ended...it went on for 10 minutes. and everybody just ROCKED OUT...it was an immense concert, and it has to be one of my best...   p.s. Siren Fest on saturday - yay! for death cab! and trail of dead! and har mar!
