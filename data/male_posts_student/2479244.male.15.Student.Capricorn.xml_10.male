I can honestly say I will generalize a lot of things, and then I will turn around and criticize someone else for making a different kind of stereotype. It's that whole "do as I say, not as I do" concept.  With that in mind, I would like to make a commentary and observation on a type of personality that I really dislike. For sake of my fingers and the hope that I don't get carpal tunnel, I'll give them a  general  term -- "Testosterite." I'm sure by simply reading that name you can gather what it is that I don't like about certain people. However, it goes deeper than people trying to be overly "manly." It goes down into seeking attention, having a superiority complex, having a foul-sounding inner self, and other things.  I get confronted by many types of people nearly every day - nice people, loud people, shy people, angry people, depressed people, self-proclaimed nymphomaniacs, and more than I can possibly count. However, out of every "type" of personality I encounter, there is really only one that makes me clench my teeth so tight they feel as if they could shatter, and that is the kind I have dubbed as Testosterites.   How can I explain a Testosterite? They are a person that is extremely attuned to what they believe to be some sort of birth-given code of manliness, a way of how their actions will play out. However, what they fail to realize is that this "code" is fabricated by society. They will make commentary on television shows, on sexual orientation, on artistic imagery, on beliefs, on cars, on food, on height, on weight, on haircolor, on race, on country, on family, on genitals, on shoes, on money, and worst of all, on women. A prominent factor in people with this (as I see it) disorder is that they feel extremely superior to females. They feel like a female is a pathetic, ignorant, incapable creature who is meant to be overseen and controlled by men. In all honesty, this kills me.   Now, I did say before that their ethical code is built into them by society, however, I do acknowledge that to some degree males are mentally different than females because of genetic codes. What I mean to say, is that men have a natural tendency to do some things differently than females. However, you cannot generalize what being a "man" is and what being a "lady" is. Some men enjoy ice skating just as much as women do. Some women enjoy killing animals just as much as some men do. It is simply an opinion type of thing. However, it is often more typical you will see men lifting 75 pound weights than women purely because men are genetically built to attain muscle faster. This does not mean any person has the right to discriminate against a man who has not "built his muscles" as quickly or as shapely as any other man. Also, it does not give any person the right to discriminate against women who do have muscles because they have trained, or to look down on those who have little physical capabilities.  Do you not believe me that there are some things women can do that men cannot? Well, I would like to offer you a nice little test that will alter your mindset a little. Go find a chair. One with four legs and a 90 degree seat and backrest. Now, take this chair over to a wall. Turn it so that if you were sitting in it you would be looking at the wall. Stand behind the chair and bend over and grab both sides (left and right) of the seat with your hands. You should now be bent in a kind of 90 degree angle. Make sure your head is touching the wall, and the experiment will begin. Try to lift your torso back up so that your are standing in correct posture, but holding the chair in your hands.  Most men (like myself the first time I tried) thought that it would be easy. I mean, hey, a chair doesn't weigh that much, how hard can it be? The experiment proved me wrong beyond all belief. About 9/10 of men cannot perform this action. Why is that? A man is genetically built so that his upper body looks like a capital 'Y.' That is to say, from the shoulders down, a man's body will taper.  However, a woman is more of a pear shape or a lightbulb shape. They are wider at their hips than their shoulders. So what does this all mean? It means that a man's center of gravity is further up on his body, and a woman's center is closer to her bellybutton; her middle. It is much easier for a woman to do this task than a man because the weight of her body is equally balanced from lower to upper because most of their mass is in the hip area.   So what was I trying to show through all of that? I was trying to show that men are not entirely more physically capable than women because they are endowed by their "Code-o-manliness," but rather by genetics. Women do not have some "Code-o-lifting-up-chairs" that they inherit, they are simply better built because of the laws of gravity. Now, that is what men need to get through their heads. They need to understand that just because we are genetically better at physical activity does not mean that we need to enjoy every physical-oriented activity and preach about what most fits in that sort of "manly" category.  Now I would like to digress so that I can comment more on what I do not like. A thing about Testosterites that I find repulsive is that they try very hard to be better than the people around them. They will throw slurs like "fatass," "moron," "f*ggot," etc., and they usually say it so that it will very much hurt the person they are saying it to. Do they say it because they are endowed with needing to point out such things at birth? Not at all. They are simply insecure with themselves because they once realized they have a full spectrum of emotions. By throwing around a ton of obscenities, they can achieve a feeling of "manliness." I do not like people who abuse words like that to make themselves feel better.   Another point that I dislike is their social aesthetics. What I mean by that is that a Testosterite "needs" to be a connoisseur of fast cars, of "manly" television, of angry music, of disrespect, of womanizing, and most importantly, of penis-envy. That's right. Most every one that I meet has a very large problem with their genitals. They feel like it is the center of their being and that they define your worthiness as a human being. People, genitals were designed to dispose of waste and to reproduce, not to be judged as your value as a person. Furthermore, they will usually judge women entirely by their breast size or how much skin they will show off. The funniest thing is that if they show off too much skin, they're a slut, but if they don't show enough, they're a goody-two-shoes-prude-little-bitch. Oh, but its alright to watch women bounce up and down on a trampoline and oogle their breasts! Yes, Testosterites are a very confusing, illogical kind of people.  They will believe that drinking, defying authority, wasting money on fast cars, stickers, sports equipment, etc., will make them a better man. They usually lack cultural stimulation, purely because they only dabble in what being a "man" really is. They usually have shallow minds, small vocabulary, big tempers, a lot of insecurities, and a strong opinion about sexuality.   To all the men out there, just listen to me when I say that being a man is what you make it out to be, not what "The Man Show" tells you. And to all the Testosterites, make yourself feel better and call me a f*ggot for posting this! Go you!  EDIT: Replaced miswording of 'genitals' as 'gentiles.' Sorry, the spellchecker will have its way with your posts if you aren't careful.
