Much better this time around ;)  To ease the troubled minds of Vegard and Ulli, I'll be getting married June 17, 2006 (703 days from now). I know that seems like a long time, but Kasia and I will have to be apart for a year while I'm in Champaign for grad school and she's in Chicago, so we decided to hold off until I'm done with school and can move back to Chicago.   Carles, great to hear from you man! And after seeing how well you write in English, I'm embarrassed about making you struggle to comprehend my castellano on MSN. When exactly does Vegard make his triumphant return to the Northland? Good to hear that he'll be working with people more at his intellectual level when he gets home ;)  Methinks Adam is quite busy as we've not heard from him in some time. Or perhaps he's just been on the piss for a few weeks now. Carles, thanks for the offer of accommodations, and I'm sure we'll all make it back to BCN, it is only a question of when. And the same offer stands for you here in Chicago (and anyone else for that matter). I could use some international flavour (other than Polish and Mexican, at least). Interesting fact: Chicago has more Polish people that any city in Poland except Warsaw, and 50% of the seminarians in the Archdiocese of Chicago are from Poland. At the parish where we're getting married, they offer more masses in Polish than in English. I thought perhaps I would have a reprieve from all the Polish when I went to Ireland, but when we got to Kylemore Abbey, all the people working in the cafeteria were Polish. Ya gotta love em!! Take care everyone.  Adeu, el teu amic (I just guessed on that one....Carles??), Tim
