Friday, afterschool, went to Grandparent's house, and decided I didn't wanna do yardwork.  So my Grandpop said I can do it sometime next week.  So we played Cribbage, I walked to dog, ate, pretty boring.  Dad picked me up and we went home.  I played guitar for about 5 or 6 hours, and then went to sleep.  Saturday, I woke up too late to see the parade on Mcgillavray, so I was kinda disappointed.  Then I heard it rained the whole time, and then I didn't mind that I slept through it.  Sat on my ass all day, played more guitar, went over to Gramm's house, came home, watched Matchstick Men (Good, very, very, good.), and then slept.  Woke up and cleaned for Mothers Day.  Thats basically it.  -  And, to please a friend.  Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe!  -  Aw, Friends is over with!  -  I put a little chat box on my blog!  Over to right.  Post something in it!  -  I've attempted to start writing some music.  The thing is, no matter how bad the song is, after you finish, you still feel a strong feeling of acomplishment.  It's also kinda fun.  -  I've had an odd attraction to Tribes, a game I haven't played in about three years, again.  -  I need to do my homework.  Will probably post later.
