You gotta' love the timeless void of summer; that vacuum of creativity that is too much sleep, too little work and too much food. My friends are mostly gone or leaving (or, for my Shadlings, scattered across the country) and I'm left to my own devices.  It's hard to go from being constantly surrounded by people 24/7 with no true privacy to pretty much left on your own all day. To go from a rigorously scheduled... schedule, to free to amuse yourself. It's a major shift.  I have a lot to do this month. Memorizing lines for  The Importance of Being Ernest  (I'm Jack, the male lead), starting a web design firm with one of my best friends, finally getting my G1, building my band (both our repetoire and our reputation), and earning some money being just a few things. But the one thing I've resolved to do everyday - and that means every single day - is write. It's something that I've always been moderately good at, but I've never dedicated myself to my writing the same way I have to my, say, guitar playing. So I've begun to write everyday. Not necessarily on the blog, but in some way, shape or form. Maybe I scribble something on the wall of my room; maybe I pen a song; maybe it's a long email to a friend, but whatever it is, I'm writing.  So now I'm going to write to you about a group I feel that I've neglected to far too great a degree: my home-dawgs, the buds back home. Sure, I wrote home to them about the Shads, but now I'm writing from home to the Shads about them. But there are so many. Where to begin?  Well, let's start with  the  home-dawgs: Brian, Nate and Kyle. They're more than hme-dawgs, they're my brothers. And I mean that the way black people mean it, cause I think it's closer that way.* We've known each other since elementary school. We didn't really come together as a group until middle school, but we've known/been aware of each other since grade 2 or 3. Funny story about how I met Brian.  It was Grade 3 and we were in the same class. Bri's quite athletic; he is now and he has always been. I was a pretty fat little kid. It was like the classic high school formula: jock picks on the nerdy fat kid. Everyday. Every single day he would harass me, punch me, tease me. Everyday! Trips to the principal's office wouldn't work, no punishment could deter him. Finally - in what kicked off my long path into the world of psychology - I decided to try and understand my enemy. I invited him over to my house one day. Well, my mom called his mom, explained the situation, and then he came over one day. Same thing, really. I forget what happened after that, but we became instand friends (it might have been my mother's homebaked cookies... the'y mmm mmm good).  I don't remember exactly how I met Nathan and Kyle; we were always in the same group of friends, I guess, and somehow we all just came together. Kyle and I go to the same school, WOSS, and Nate and Brian go to the same school, IRHS.  I'm the rock-n-roller-, Bri's the jock, Kyle's the pretty one, and Nate's the kid with tonnes of artistic talent who just wastes it all away dickin' around.  Anyhow, those are the home-dawgs. We've been through the best and the worst together. Damn close. They're welcome at my house anytime, even if we're not home. They don't need to knock; they call my mom, "Mom"; and they treat my little brother like their own. Truly my "bros."  Then there's Kate. Oh, where do I begin with Kate? Our history is long and convoluted; so long in fact, that I think it would kill my Blog if I were to type it out here. So I'll leave it with this: I met Kate 4 years ago this September at orchestra. To call her my better half would be an injustice against her as a human being. We're best of friends; she's my red-headed sidekick, forever at my side (if not physically, then spiritually). As a despairing Catharine Earnshaw says to Nelly in  Wuthering Heights , "I  am  Heathcliff," so am I Kate.  I couldn't talk about friends without including Jeff. If Brian, Nate and Kyle are my bros, then Jeff is most certainly my best friend. He's the lead guitarist in my band, Beermouse. Jeff and I have been going to the same school since grade 7, but we only really got to be friends in grade 10, when we were both part of our school production of  Macbeth . Jeff is quite intelligent, and quite excellent at completely ignoring that fact until it serves his purpose. He can be very charming and sophisticated (naturally, my parents love any of my friends that can discuss Stravinsky instead of sports) when he wants to, and a downright dick others. He knows how to push buttons, both the right ones and the wrong ones.  Finally there's Alison. I've known her for less than a year, but we're very close nonetheless. She's one of those rare people who gets to be beautiful, talented,  and  brilliant (well, rare in Oakville. We had plenty of them at Shad). I've decided I'm going to marry her someday. Others have pointed out that she might not feel the same way, but I feel it's  fate /  Anyhow, I think I've just told you all that about my home-dawgs without actually telling you anything about them. Maybe later. I'm tired and need a nap.  Cheers from the basement, - Cary (aka Donut O)   *That's something from Zoolander, for all the uncultured swine in the audience. Although I do think it's closer.
