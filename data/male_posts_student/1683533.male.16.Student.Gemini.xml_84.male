It features songs including "I wanna be a Homosexual", "Hey Suburbia", and "Girl Next Door".  If you like Screeching Weasel, but you are unsure of what CD to get, this is a great cd to introduce you to them (this is my first Screeching Weasel cd).  And if you already have a thriving Weasel collection this cd includes live songs and several pages of their history in the pamphlet included.  Plus, wouldn't you like to listen to your favorite Screeching Weasel songs without having to switch CDs?  Overall Grade: A
