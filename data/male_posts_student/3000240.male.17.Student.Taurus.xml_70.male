Well If you've ever seen what pictures I keep (non-pornographic I assure you) on my PC then you will know what oddities I'll be displaying in the coming month. Think of the last two as a tame introduction mon ami.  Neho, it's the oracle's 91st birthday on the weekend, which means somebody going to have to either buy 91 candles (heaven above) or one hell of a present (which will probably be me judging on the family's prejudices against the young members of it, namely me and Harry exploitation). Poor little Ethel (who solely endorses the Granny Smith apples lol) won't know what to do with all the generosity and gifts. Will she   drown   (literally) in them? Will she think due to her ever (  bless her  ) deteriorating brain, think that the gift rap paper is  in fact  the present? Wow it sounds like a roller coaster ride of emotional shocks and shenanigans; and I  only  wish I was there to see it that's all *rolls eyes*.  Happy birthday Gran, and have a good day. xBuBzx
