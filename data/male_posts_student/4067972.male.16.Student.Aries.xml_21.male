Because the carpet was gone, all of the tackstrip was exposed so i stepped on it a coupla times.  little nail holes in my feet. ouch.  After i got the holes in my feet, i had to go stain my grandma's deck.  hot work, but not too bad. Finally, my summer's about to start, but it's already almost over.
