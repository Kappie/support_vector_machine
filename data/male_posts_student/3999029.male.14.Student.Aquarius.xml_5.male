Everyonein the tech lab are "piaing" their project's final web report. LKY is doing their self-evaluation. Rui An says that it must come from the hearts. LKY is groaning about writing his evaluation. I am here slacking, hahaha.          Lotsof sec 1s here are playing games. LKY wants to go to bonus.com to playski. Ever since after the Air Rifle inter-school final, I feel that I needed a long rest after such long periods ofhectic training.        Backto the tech lab, Altron is busy doinghis group's web report. I am still here slacking, tink I'll go back to the range half an hour later. Repeat, re-enforce and reflect. Thatis whatthe Dyslexics preject is about. I also joined them in their DAS maths training programme in orderto get maths ACE and CIP points.
