Adaptation  is screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's new vehicle, in which the protagonist is a Charlie Kaufman, who is struggling with adapting Susan Orlean's award-winning novel  urlLink The Orchid Thief .  Kaufman's inclusion of a Kaufman character in the script reminds me of Richard Powers' use of himself as the protagonist in  urlLink Galatea 2.2 , one of the best books no one has read.  The inclusion of self in work creates an obvious calamity for the general reader, as we don't know whether to read this as autobiographical or fiction...though when is an author writing a removed work?    That question begs greater discussion, but I'm interested in comparing Kaufman's work to my work in  Clubbing ...this is my blog, and if I want to hoist my ego to the roofbeams, by damned I will do it.  In no way am I comparing myself to Kaufman as a writer...in fact, walking out of  Adaptation , I felt about as insignificant as any artist could possibly imagine... Adaptation  was a screenplay rich with conundra and discrepancy, and it was so much the better for being unique...the voice of the author was heard, and not because he was a character in the script; Kaufman took an idea and, working within the parameters of screenwriting, fucked with the parameters enough to let something new be shown.    I just finished a 30 page paper on the subject of originality in screenwriting, and its effect on women's empowerment in the film industry...while the essay was a feminist critique of the traditional Hollywood structure, it was evident that I was displeased with the state of affairs in screenwriting as perpetuated by Syd Field, Robert McKee, and Lew Hunter, among others.  However, looking back over my most recent work, I am dismayed to see that I wrote a script rich with ideas and barren of originality.  In order to appease the masses, I compromised my voice (a voice I am unsure of) and worked within a format rather than even trying to see how much the walls of Bob Foshko would give.  My screenplay is adequate; with several basic revisions I could probably sell the thing, but it's naked.  In fostering to a commercial public, I stripped  Three Strikes  of any authentic voice.    The last piece I wrote that was true to myself was  Clubbing , an 11 minute film about the fear of venturing outside walls and comfort zones, and the fear that even at a young age, your best days might be behind you.  The film was a triumph in being produced, edited, and shown at festival, but in all honesty, about 40% of what I felt the script was about was portrayed adequately on-screen, due to a combination of problems facing a new filmmaker.  But the script was fresh; it was exciting; it was my work.  After seeing the final result and the tepid audience response, I feared that I made a mastubatory piece, and vowed to work for my audience rather than myself.  From that moment, I lost my voice.  The piece of work that got me into school here,  Questions , had about 20 minutes of authentic, good writing...most dealing with an opening sequence and the vivid imagination of the supporting character Cameron.  The more recent  Three Strikes  employs some great tactics, and follows film rules as they should be...but there is something missing.  But I don't lose sleep over it, and I think that is the problem.    The most ambitious work I ever wrote was a poem about salvation via oral sex...it didn't happen the way I wanted, but I was 19, I had lots of time.  The most compelling work I ever wrote was a poem entitled  Lighting , using theatrical effects to convey a sense of anomie in my inability to get close to a girl.  Good, but the subject seems trite.  The best overall piece I've written would be  Three Strikes , but it isn't compelling, it isn't ambitious...it isn't what I'm interested in writing.  The script interests me...I've thought over that script for years, but now that it's done, it looks like something I could see on the USA network, or that spends six weeks in the theatre and gets one thumb up, one thumb down, and puts my name on the map so I can get a job writing for Tom Arnold's next failed sitcom.    An interesting anecdote regarding James Joyce...when he was writing  urlLink Dubliners , a friend came by and asked him how the writing was going.  "Good, good," said Joyce.  "I got a lot of good work done today." "How much did you get done?" "Two words." The friend paused.  "Two words?"  he said.  "That doesn't sound like a good day's work." "Ahhh," said Joyce, "they were two beautiful words." I wrote ten pages of my most recent work,  Faith  in 90 minutes on Monday.  Needless to say, it sucks.
