If I were to die tomorrow, who would know that I love them?  Who haven't I told?  Who have I hurt?  What have I done that could put a blemish on my name for the rest of eternity?  Does it matter?  I was sittin' there....and I really wanted sumone to put my arm around...sumone...who's not there anymore*sigh*  (I miss you, I miss you) Hello there, the angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we want  Where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends  (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness  Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted  Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)  (I miss you, I miss you)  (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you) (I miss you, I miss you)  *sigh* You know who you are...  FUCK!!! Shit-headed-duche-fucks...that's a good way to describe people like me.  Thank you.  anyway...back to the movie. It was a good movie...even though sum parts were unrealistic...oh well, and then to make things worse...it was love songs on the radio all the way home.  Ironic huh???  Life is out to get me... "Drowning in Life"...sounds like the name of a song. Gonna go to bed now...Sweet dreams everyone.  Forgot what I was gonna write about, besides all this. Peace!  Spense
