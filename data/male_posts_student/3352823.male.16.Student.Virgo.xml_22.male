I don't have anything HUGE to do until next week when I have History ISU and test/quiz... And my Business exam. Yes, I will enjoy this while it lasts.  Canadian Idol tonight. I started watching it last year until they started picking the top 10 or whatever. But I got bored, and there wasn't anyone I liked. Except for this REALLY hot French girl. Man... She was in my dreams for a while. Or... Right.  My in class essay went well. It was easy... Somewhat. I wrote about the minor characters (Roderigo, Emila and Bianca) in  Othello . I hope it'll be good. But the real kick in the balls was when the teacher didn't show up. Haha. We had a sub. It was HILARIOUS to see everyone scramle and run around like a headless chicken because they needed to ask questions or what have you.   Hm... Man the weather is playing tricks on me. I was walking to the convenience store... And there was this HUGE menacing black cloud overhead... But it like blew over top and away. It was well weird.   Better git going... Dinner awaits.
