The past week has been crammed full of events, parties, practices, sleeping, and other things i forgot or cant talk about, and North Rockland finally had a void of bad times, drama, and shit that no one wants to deal with.   To me, this week was like an awsome friday night... you know the one where you go out, have the best time of your life with your friends, get trashed, go home to your own bed when the nightly events are done, and you wake up hangover free ready for saturday night... yeah, it was that good.  I usually dont have good times at parties becuase i always think of things that will or can go wrong. But that didnt happen ONCE at any of the parties that pat had. I think everyone who was at pats this week should at least say thank you to him and give him a beer even if its your last the next time your out. Its not every day a person opens his door for you to walk in, especially for a week straight. I dont think ill ever be able to re-pay pat (or his brother for that fact) for the parties he had that lasted till 8 in the morning almost every day, the drunken coversations with the tke's, the fear and loathing quotes and smoke ups, the selection of bombs that i did too many of... then drinking and smoking right on top of it, and passing out on practically every couch in the house.  If there was one thing i realized this break was that everyone can have fun in north rockland, and that chillin with my friends (either under the influence or not) is worth more than anything to me. As a matter of fact, i think everyone realized that.  If you didnt have a good time this week, then im very sorry for you. like i said before, this weeks success could have been produced into a 'teen movie', cause everything was perfect - the beginning, the end, and everything in between. This is one week ill never forget  and no one had a camera the entire time  Darin
