The last few days have indeed been memorable. What with the before mentioned singing, during which i was singled out of the group by the teacher that yelled at us when clearly i wasn't the only one there. yes maybe i DID sing a bit louder but still...all 6 of us were standing there. of course i had my petty revenge that night with the sacking of his room that evening, nothing harmful, just misplacing a few things and some streamers placed everywhere...fun times. there were others that i was helping but they shall not be named. then today was the the ardrossan picnic and parade, it used to be the canada day picnic and parade but it was changed because of schedualling conflicts a few years ago. so summer starts and the festivities begin right? or the tedious amounts of yard work. but then i go to Ohio for two weeks to see louis, who i haven't seen for 4 years! truly gonna be great i think... -Matt
