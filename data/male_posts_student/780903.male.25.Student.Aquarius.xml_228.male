We'd resolved to be better, to show up prepared So in case we got called on, our ego'd be spared We'd have pages and pages and pages of notes Filled with case cites and precedent, Justices' quotes But then sitting in classes, the truth would be clear Perhaps it's not worth missing American Idol's premiere The briefs can be shorter, could read with less care As long as the big picture story is there The details for later -- the Daily Show's on The outlines can wait till a few weeks have gone And if I get called on, I'll surely survive Cause February sweeps will be soon to arrive All the great motivation was here for a day A brand new semester; they all start that way.
