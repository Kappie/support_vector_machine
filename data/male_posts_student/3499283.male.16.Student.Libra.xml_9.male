I saved it as a draft so those of you how are very observant might have been curious as to why this post runs until Monday - though I can see into the future, I did not exercise those powers here.  This weekend has been quite the adventure, considering I pretty much had a four day weekend. Friday was consumed with an all day elementary jazz tour, in which we entertained four different schools.  The last school, Ferguson, was by far the most enjoyable of the four, partly because it was the end of the day and the kids were laughing and clapping along, but also due to the fact that I went to Ferguson. WOOT.    The Jazz tour led straight into Cabaret rehearsal.  This was the first time that Kaitlin and I got to work the sound board in preparation for the show on Saturday, but surprisingly the entire dress -rehearsal ran smoothly with next to no mic problems. Last year and earlier this year sound wasn't the most enjoyable thing in the world.  If you made one mistake ryan or whoever would give you a hard time and it was a sucky environment. Cabaret was the laid-back smaller group that I needed, and the addition of Kaitlin made it even better.  After rehearsal I got the opportunity to drive Becky home, and I hope I gained her trust.  I'd rather not be known as the crazy driver that gets people killed.    Onto day 3 and the most hectic of the bunch.  I wish my parents would be more lenient in letting me drive me friends around.  Because of this lunch plans with Kelsey fell through, but I atleast got the opportunity to drive around town and pick up some stuff. I got a cassette adapter to play some rawkin CDs in my car with my cd player, only to find out that my speakers aren't the sexiest things in the world. Oh but that will change...once I get another job.  Anyways I also drove to Holiday Hair and got my hair cut by myself - Im giddy with this new independence - and I don't think they screwed it up too badly.    Later that afternoon I was able to share my driving with yet another friend (it wouldnt have happened if it weren't totally necessary, but it still ticks me off that I wasn't able to go out to lunch).  I drove out to get Dan V and we got to march in the Boalsburg Parade in our sexy marching band uniforms! Oh man did that ever ROCK.  There's really not much to say there except that the Beaver 103 mascot is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and it has probably made numerous little children pee their pants.  Welllll after the parade we filled the busses and went back to State High but got there at about 6:30!! Call for Cabaret was 6! FREAKIN A.  I threw my stuff in the car and probably ruined Dan's trust in my driving. By the time i got him home I was already almost an hour late for Cabaret.  Since my house was on the way back to State High I dropped off my marching band uniform, got the shortest shower of my life because I was unpleasant after marching in hot weather in a uniform, and put on dark clothing for Cabaret.  When I finally got back to the school Kaitlin was in a panic - hehe SORRY - I was only ohh an hour and 15 minutes late , but who's counting?  The show went really well. I was impressed.  I thought it was going to be an almost perfect sound show until I had to go and fudge it up with a phone ringing in Hell but we're not going into that.  The show ran late and by the time it ended there was no chance of my getting home by 11.  Instead of making my parents wake up my sister and drive out to pick me up, which they expressed would really be an inconvenience, I decided to drive uber-carefully and get home a.s.a.p. That didn't go over too well.  Because I could have gotten caught and blah blah blah I can't drive until Tuesday which I guess really isn't that bad.  Finally, I watched an SNL rerun, the one with Ben Affleck hosting, which just so happened to be my favorite one of the season.  Sunday was a very relaxing day.  Chris invited me to his old neighbor's annual picnic/get together and it was pretty fun.  Chris and I took on his brother Alex and his girlfriend in badmitton.  I also proceeded in kicking Chris' sorry anus in lawn darts and volleyball but I don't think he minded too much. Mwahahahaha. I stayed at the picnic for two hours or so and then tried to convince my parents to let me go to the Dusk-to-Dawn drive in thing.  They weren't thrilled about a bunch of unsupervised 16 year olds staying up all night and the fact that two of the 5 movies were R, so instead, Dan V, Chris and I went to The Day after Tomorrow.    The movie was awesome partly because the special effects kicked butt, but also because the audience was so immature, maybe including us, and made kissing noises at the corny first kiss and tried predicting lines after dramatic pauses in the action. That was all followed by unnecessary screaming while the flesh-hungry wolves were enjoying their screen time.. well it was fun, maybe you just had to be there.  Before going home we checked out the movie posters that Cinema 5 were selling. This gave us the joyous chance to have a conversation with a girl on a volleyball team from Virginia and her mom.  It was pretty much a routine conversation until the mom asked us why the stores closed so early.  This is when we began to think that perhaps she may have downed a few beers because the next thing she said just doesn't come out of a mother's mouth while her daughter is standing right there.  "The shops close so early around here, we were going to go to Abercrombie and buy her some sleazy skirts. She likes to wear those things"  Well she seemed nice and really didnt care about what her mom said. Maybe State College is just different.  I left with 3 new posters to clothe my walls: the Ladykillers, Master and Commander and........ Mean Girls. You know it.   I'm starting to think that I should read this as my weekend story to Mr Lyke.  It might actually be worse than one of Cliff's. haha just kidding cliff.  After the movie I tried getting back to my memoir for English, but that just wasn't going to happen. I have 200 some pages to read in one day and the book sucks as is.   Before going to bed James enlightened me on the good news.  James and Krysta, I wish you the best.  Monday began lazily as the last day of this wonderful vacation.  Just like last year the rain let loose, but this time we decided not to go to downtown Boalsburg.  I haven't really done anything today besides eat some stuff, watch some TV, and read some of this stupid stupid book.   I promise no future posts will be this long.  I should probably waste the next few hours of this groggy day and get back to this book.  Peace  Chad
