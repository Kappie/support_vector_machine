I like what's happening, I like what's been happening, and I like where it's going.  I almost feel like I should be continuously knocking on wood, crossing my fingers, or possibly not verbalizing that things are going good, just in case.  I hate that feeling, but sometimes it's weird when things seem to be going great.. it's like "wait, what bad stuff is about to happen."  I like the sound of certain people's voices.  Some people's voices make me smile.  Some people can talk and just soothe your entire soul.    Acid reflux SUX.  Is that another word for heartburn?  I think it is, so I hope I'm not using it wrong, but anyway heartburn/acid reflux is a bitch and I'm having it right now.  Tomorrow is going to be a FANTASTIC day, I've already decided.  My plans for tomorrow are going to rock, and end with me getting trashed by 4pm.    Cheers lads.
