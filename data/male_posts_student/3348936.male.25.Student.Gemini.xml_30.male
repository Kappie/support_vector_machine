However, this is not the case with Shrek 2.  Littered with nods and winks at other films thourghout the main story does not suffer.And despite being bombarded with adverts for childrens toys opr family cars before hand evryone in the screen laughed along.  If you do go to watch it stay for the end of the credits for the now expected short....
