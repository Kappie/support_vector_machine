Sadly, I was the only student watching the movie with the club sponsor, a teacher. The small group of students who made up the club are all seniors, and today was their last day. Being the only student watching the movie, I am now determined to revamp the club next year by promoting it more and setting up some better activities. It would be great to plan some trips to a theater, and I think that would at least draw some people in. Also, (although I'm not too sure it will work) I am going to write to some companies over the summer to see if I can somehow get some DVDs for the club "library." I'm just hoping that someone will see the merit in supporting a student film club.
