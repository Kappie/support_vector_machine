A new internet service provider,  urlLink Clearwire , is launching a wireless internet access plan this summer.  It is only going to be in two locations: Saint Cloud, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida.  Hopefully if the provider is successful, the coverage area can be expanded rather quickly.  What makes this service exciting is the connection speed is the same, if not faster, than broadband access at a relatively cheap price.
