She has supported me every day of my life. She's just cool like that. Happy birthday mom! I'll let you have a corner piece of the cake.  P.S.  People like the great Christina Ricci and that other guy, Abraham Lincoln, were born on February 12. Here's a list of other celebrities who were  urlLink born on this day  in history.
