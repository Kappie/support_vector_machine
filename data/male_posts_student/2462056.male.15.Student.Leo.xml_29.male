I'm bored, and don't have anything better to do.  I've been listening to Brand New's album "Your Favorite Weapon" lately, and it is totally awesome, even though I've had it for a really long time.  So yeah, I'm leaving today around lunch time for Mississippi and it is going to be pretty fun.  I'm debating on whether i should bring my bass or not, in case I get bored.  But I don't know how much I would play it.  I borrowed D12 World from Greg.  Hehe that CD is awesome.  There is a troll on my desk.  I'm not going to take a shower today.  My dad and sister are at Books-a-Million.  My mom is at work.  My stomach is empty.  Okay, I'm done.  Well I'll see everyone again next week, stay safe, much love, bye.
