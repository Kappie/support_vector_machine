Idn...I guess I just lost my footing a bit and God became less of a thing and my friends, school, and parents relationships became more priorities because everyone of those things was screwed:P.  I've made a committment and I'm giving my all to God.  I want Jesus to be my bestfriend...and man I'm sick of lukewarm living.  I've been really talking to God lately...and man I've just given like all these problems I have to him...and like nothing has really been solved...but I've got a peace about it.  My relationship with my parents has been kinda junky this past while...I've been constantly having to humble my self and apologize, but I'm finding God gives me an obedience that I can't help but do what they ask.  The Friends Sitch is pretty trashed:P...I kinda blew it a bunch with a bunch of different people.  Man  Idn who God has for me as friends...but I'm hoping God brings someone quick.  And I know u think like o u got tons of friends:P like...I'm looking for close friends...not shallow hang out friends.  Once u've had a best friend u can't go without one if u know what I mean...It's just like someone is there and they care soo much for u and they just wanna talk to u:)...and just know how ur doin.  Jesus and me r gonna get super tight...but if u know what i mean...it's kinda like u need someone who u can see and someone who's physically there:P Idn.  Welp Anyways...I'm really excited bout what life has in store,  I'm doin this thing for God...and I'm gonna do w/e that takes:)...GOD RULES EH???  Blessed be his glorious name!!!:D haha reply if u wish:) haha comments are nice
