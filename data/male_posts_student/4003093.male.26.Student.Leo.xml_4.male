For the blogger, it is a gigantic moment, signifying the first step towards ... well towards making sure the blog is not deleted by the tacky administrators of the server for one thing.     Okay, joke asides (and not very good ones either :D). Let's go to a possible FAQ about this blog.     Q:  What is the purpose of this blog   A:  Well, Indonesia is a dump right now. It's chaotic, people are apathic towards everything. The poor is still poor, sick, dying. The rich is still rich. This blog is a collection of thoughts about the situation and hopefully some proposed solution.      Q:  What will be in this blog   A:  Problems, ideas, and grievances facing Indonesia.      Q:  Personal life?   A:  Maybe you'll get a glimpse of my life, but that won't be the main thing. I have a diary for that, and you won't be seeing it anytime soon.      Q:  Why is it in English?   A:  I tend to write better in english. More relaxed, it's just a style I'm used to.      Q:  Talk is cheap man... do something.    A:  Sure. Talk is cheap. Talk is easy. But at least I do it. How many people actually talk about the problem?
