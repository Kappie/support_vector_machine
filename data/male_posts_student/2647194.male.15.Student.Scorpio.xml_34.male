Geez, my parents are gone at a concert (woot), and its too cold to bike anywhere, really. Plus none of my friends could do anything. This left me stuck at home for the evening...with nothing to do but walk the dogs, do the dishes, and play piano. Oh-and go online...  How my day went: 8:30-got up, etc. 10:15-left for church 12:50-got home from church 4:00-went over to Dan's 5:45-came home from Dan's because his parents weren't home, meaning they couldn't take us to the U of M student center to shoot pool, and his dad took away his TV and Xbox controllers, meaning we couldn't play halo. 6:05-ate dinner 6:30 to the current time: I've been interspersing being online while doing the dishes, recycling, walking the dogs, and playing piano.  I don't think I'll make it long enough to watch the other movie that I rented last night, "Runaway Jury". I'm fading fast, and its not fun to be really tired at 9:13 on Sunday evening on Spring Break. *yawns* ugh.  I'll put the lyrics in the middle, since I don't feel like closing with them tonight. *there will be more content after this*  "Bop bop.  Care about the moonlight and holding you tight and asking my questions. Everyone loves a situation.  Long walks on the beach. The press will impeach. Lately I'm finding I am the book and you are the binding.  I guess they'll read everything about you. Though the press might shoot me down I'm still true. I sell my book for free. That's what you do to me.  Oh, you are my family tree. Be good to me Take care of me.  Bop bop.  There's hotels in the sea, Trash in the sky., The net-dustry's growing. Stick to love songs kid, that's all you're knowing.  They push you away or tie you up. It don't really matter. But if your head is up you won't get much sadder.  But who am I to preach a word or two when I can't lift my own head without you? If my mental state kept you from coming around I hope the world would shoot me down for losing you. A broken branch I'd be if you weren't grown to me.  Oh, you are my family tree. Be good to me. Be good to me. Be good to me. Take care of me.  Bop bop."  "Family Tree", Ben Kweller  Nights like this just give you time for whatever. I use it to think. *a peak inside my head* I just sometimes think of how lucky I am. I mean, I take drum lessons, piano lessons, I own a piano, a drumset, I do well in school, I'm able to be a cyclist in the summer, I have a monopoly on the lawn mowing business in St. Paul Park (lol). I've got my own computer with internet, and I've got parents who know when the shut the [expletive] up, well, most of the time...lol. I'm also priveledged to not have any video game systems (*gasp*). Yeah, they'd just take up more of my time that could be spent playing piano, or talking to important people...lol. A lot of these things have to deal with material objects, but there's one thing that stands out. For the past 3 weeks this Thursday, I've been, I don't know, more positive. My overall outlook has changed, I look forward to more things, and my school weeks go by faster. The weekends seem even more like a green light to go and get out there, do things and go places. Even during the week its better, namely Mondays. Fridays are pretty much a gateway to the weekend, a stretch of smooth, black pavement that leads to that green light.  All of that stems from one gift I'm quite thankful for, and very lucky to have: a girl who cares about me as much as I care about her, which happens to be quite a bit. Thanks, Amanda.
