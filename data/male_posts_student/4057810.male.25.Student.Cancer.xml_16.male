There are a couple things I'd like to add, though.  First is a links page, since I've got this wacky notion that somebody out there wants to see what kind of web sites I frequently peruse.  Second is the ability to add photos to my posts.  There may already be a way to do this, but I can't seem to figure out how.  I think I had a "Third", but appears to have now evaded my grasp.  The last post I wrote regarding my sister painted her in a rather unflattering light.  Yeah, she can be really spoiled, but if that's the worst of her failings, it's really not that bad.  She knows that she's spoiled too, which puts her ahead of the pack, and her awareness of that aspect of her personality puts her in a good position to move past it, if she wanted to.  I should point out that I'm quite proud of my sister, the way she has dedicated herself these past years to becoming an excellent English teacher.  I've never sat in on her class, but I remember her going over ESL texts and trying to create lesson plans that were useful and fun.  Even though she's been unsure of what path to take in life, as I've watched the effort she has put into becoming a good teacher, I'm reminded of all the mediocre to poor educators I've had in the past, and I'm certain that if she choses to pursue a teaching career, that she will never be amongst those ranks.
