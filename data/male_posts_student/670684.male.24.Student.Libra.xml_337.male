Lots to update on...sorry about the failures of the other blog and LiveJournal...but my baby is back!  And hopefully I am too.    One more blog to update you on...because it's thesis time, I decided to give myself a journal for the thesis.     urlLink http://www.etaoinshrdlu.net/docudrama   Notes on what I'm doing, what I think I'm doing, maybe I'll even link some rough drafts up there...I'm not incredibly worried about this idea being stolen, as it's a bitch of a script and an idea, and I doubt any company would ever buy it.  But I'm not writing this one for a buyer...I'm writing this one for me to make.
