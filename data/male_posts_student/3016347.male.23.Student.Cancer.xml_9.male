You only lose in holding back.  Bottomline : Don't be afraid to tell the person you love how much you  love her. Let them know, let them decide and make a decision.  The best thing in life is to tell the person you like/love how important they are to you, by doing so, you feel liberated. And you are proud of yourself because you are responsible to your own feelings. Never betray your own feelings, because you are the only one who will suffer, no one else.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    after this incident, i found out tat there are still ppl around me who are still cared for me. i think from now on i should concentrate on wat i have missed these few month and appreciates ppl around me. K has been there for me in these past few weeks although she had a bf. some knew wat happened and they had been supportive to me as wat i have did was rite, it was her fault for making these happen.  "no man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, wont make you cry" .  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Don't throw your back to love when it's already in front of you, don't drive it away from you because if you did, someday you'll think again why you let love fly away when it was once next to you.  Bottomline : Treasure the one who loves you, it's not easy to find a person who loves you. It's always more valuable to have a sincere heart.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    i am over with her and i think i have to go on with my life without her ( "Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you" ). i am really happy to be with her in the past few month and i will remember it for sometime. and tat is why i have to courage to write it all down, i might forget but i will let this blog to remind me of wat happened. i wish to tell her how much i still care for her but she will never listen or care to listen. she still blame me for being 'small gas' but it wasnt about the rejection. it was about the lies she said, i sacrifice so much for her bcos i tot she was lonely n sad n i have tried so hard to make her happy but......it was all her sweet lies.     no matter how i have tried to hold on to this relationship/frenship, we still have to say goodbye again. i have tried so hard, so hard that i am so tired of anything but in the end, we have to say goodbye....   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   It's always better to have found the courage to love even if you lose it in the end rather than never found love because you were too afraid of the challenge.  Bottomline : Don't give up if you face or think that you have competitors. It's always better to try, if you succeed, the reward is more than you can expect. But if you don't try or don't summon up the courage, you might lose the one you like/love forever...   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
