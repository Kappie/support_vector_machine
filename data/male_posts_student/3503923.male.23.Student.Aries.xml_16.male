Your crackling Alba stereo remains, The bad air from your rotting meat is still around.  Travelling 1st class, when others walk, You despise the rain and how they talk. Friends only to friends, the elect trend, Send from abroad the eclectic blend.  Your unpaid electric bill remains, The phone-cards litter your floor still.  Stick with like, eat what is familiar, Itâ€™s like an adventure in your wardrobe. Import your flavour, ignore our presence, Can we be open and mix, integrate even an ounce.  Your debts are real; do you ever plan to pay? Came back to reclaim; would defend it as a right?  We know what is ours, how to treat our own. Could it be; what is mine is not really so. What can I lose when I own nothing? Possessed by what you have, which is never enough?  You can rob me blind, strip me clean, walk away With my nest, leave me empty handed; but what Have I lost and what have you gained?
