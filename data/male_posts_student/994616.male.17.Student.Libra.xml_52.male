Next add the ice cream, then fill with milk up to the top of the ice cream, to fill in any gaps. Blend until parents yell at you for "All that noise". Pour into glass(es). Sreve fresh, and cold.   Caution: do not mix with stress, causes ill feeling in stummy  On yeah, just incase i didn't make it obvious i had an oreo milkshake tonight
