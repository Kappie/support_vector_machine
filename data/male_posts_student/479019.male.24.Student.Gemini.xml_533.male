Does he realize if Africa wasn't made Europe and America's bitch for the past 300 years, the disease wouldn't nearly be as wide spread? That's why Liberia is fucked up right now.  US troops are going to be in Iraq for up to 4 years... how about US troops will be in Iraq as long as the US is a superpower?  Shower, left over pizza and meat for lunch, work on paper...  **
