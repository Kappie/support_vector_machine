ONLY my pair of shoes. not my dads shoes or my mums shoes, but MY shoes. well i must say that my dad doesnt keep his shoes outside, so there was no chance of his shoes being stolen, but still!! its not nice to just wake up one day and find your shoes missing from the shoe rack. but even then, that guy must have pretty big feet if he wants to steal size 9 shoes...  It all happened yesterday afternoon when i was going out with my parents. i had skipped church in the morning so i didnt have to wear my shoes then. only when we were walking out the door and i couldnt find my shoes did i ask my mum. The conversation went something like :-  "Mum, where are my shoes?"  "arent they there?"  "Where?"  "On the shoe rack or on the floor...i dunno."  "No theyre not on the shoe rack or on the floor."  "What?? How can they be not there? Maybe its under your dads car." And so dad moves his car away only to discover they are NOT under his car, therefore proving beyond any reasonable doubt that there have been thieves in the house and they stole MY shoes. The worse part is, it had to have happened sometime saturday night because i still wore it out that night. Trouble is, i stayed up till 3am that night and i never noticed anything wrong. To think some stupid idiot might have climbed in while i was sitting comfortably here really irks me. not for my own safety, but for the fact that i might have just happened to go downstairs and catch him in the act. i really wonder what would happen then.. hmmm........... i hope he didnt think he was stealing a pair of expensive designer shoes though. that pair which he took actually came from china with a price tag of 90 ren men bi, which works out to be about 50 ringgit. =D It did look expensive because the logo on it looked like reebok or somethin..but i assure u it was nothing more than some local brand. Ahh the chinese, ever the best at copying others.... =P  Well a few other things have been happening lately, like the death of that form 1 student from my school. I must say its pretty sad and tragic to hear about a father killing his 3 kids and then taking his own life. 4 lives gone in the space of what..? half an hour? i remember seeing a small commotion outside block A after school on friday when the news had reached us. but i didnt know what had happened till i asked someone else online later. its really funny how everyone likes to speculate and come up with ideas as to why the dad did this or why he did that, or how could he think of ever going into heaven or whatever after killing off his 3 kids, or what the mum must be going through right now. To me whats done is done and it has to be accepted like everything else that happens in this world. besides, this is probably just an isolated case which happened only because the father lost his mind after fearing too much that he would lose custody of his children. but in the end ill just repeat one of my dads favourite lines "if its your time to go, you go." yea i know it sounds a bit harsh or crude, but hey thats life, if God decides he wants your life back, who are you to stop him?  well thats all im gonna blog for now..there are other things i could add in but im just too tired to write anymore not to mention im feeling a bit sick too. So GoodNight Everyone.
