Unlike most people I do get a little embarassed when Chris makes a complete fool of himself because it puts a little black spot of cancer on my perfect reputation.  *sarcasm*  Don't worry though, someday I'll be the crazy guy on the end of the street who wears a kilt and has green hair because he was nice to everyone all the time but eventually cracked and now he talks to himself as he eats cabbage from his three square foot garden next to a shack containing fifteen varieties of stuffed crows, all of which were stuffed by hand in the dark after reading the paper, twice.   . . .   Either that or being nice will pay off and I'll earn a high paying job in the computer market.  It could go either way though.
