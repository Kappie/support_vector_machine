I've been so busy with school and kung fu that I don't even know what's going on with me, as if I've been in limbo and there's no way out.  Hopeless?  No.  I don't think so.  The only feeling I can think of is "Numb".  Do I have emotions you ask?  I do.  I smile with happiness.  I cry with loss.  I... really don't know.  I should know myself pretty darn good by now and yet I still don't understand why I feel this way.        I'm not in a relationship anymore.  For the past 4 years I have dedicated my time and energy to my boo.  I have been single for the past week and don't know what to do.  We had so many things in common, so many places we would hang out, and just spending time with her family was great.  But, as the ups and downs continued we both agreed to take a break just so we could have time to think... and that's when I decided to be single.  I know she hurts, but now I have to think about myself first.  That's what I want.  I need time to grow by myself.  Time to be... Just me.         My motorcycle, my R6, My bike... was stolen from me last Friday the 23rd around 3pm.  I was having lunch with my homeboy at UTC and when we were on our way back that's when I noticed, my bike was gone.  It so happens that if we would have came out 10 mins earlier then we would have seen these guys.  My homeboys bike wasn't even touched.  3 long years that bike has been goal of mine.  I got it and with-in 5 months... Gone.  Blessing in disguise?  You could say that but I'm stubborn... I don't want to believe that.  Lord, help me forgive these bastards (sorry).  All I know is Karma is a BIT*H.       BUT, there has been good things that happened to me this week.    -  I've been able to read my books again.    -  I've had long conversations with the Lord.    -  I've had deep conversations with my sister (I miss that).    -  I've been reading the bible.       My feeling now you ask?  Numb.... Still.
