You know when you look at or think of something for a long time and go to say a word or statement, and you say what you were looking at or thinking about? thats what happened. at the end of each practice, we do like a little team cheer. well i was looking at a lacrosse ball on the other side of the field, and i was looking at it because the girls lax team was walking by it and i KNEW they were going to steal it. so i was looking at it and my coach goes "darin call it (meaning the cheer) and i Say "BALLS ON Three", but im supposed to say team. i felt like an idiot, especially after coach grasso goes, "no its team on three dumbass, get the fuck out of here" i also laughed alot too thats my wierd experience, please be sure to leave a comment on shit that happens like that to you
