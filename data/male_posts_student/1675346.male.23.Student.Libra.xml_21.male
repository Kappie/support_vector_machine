The password for the managing is generated randomly on start and it's written in your home directory, under WindowsXP it's \\Documents and Settings\Your account name\ .netbeans\ 3.6\ jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19_base\ conf\ tomcat-users.xml I don't know why, but I was getting strange error messages not letting me display the administration util so I compared the same file with the one shipping with the stand alone Tomcat and as it was missing the admin role, I added it  <role rolename="admin"/> <user username="admin" password="your_password" roles="admin,manager"/>   Works fine now...
