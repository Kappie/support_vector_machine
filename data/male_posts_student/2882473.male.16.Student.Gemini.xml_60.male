I had another go on my electronic chess game, and won, after losing only 3 pawns, 2 rooks and a queen, after leaving the computer with only a king and pawns. Not that you wanted to hear  all  the details :) I had better increase the level next time I play, so as to keep me on my toes. I strongly reccomend all to take up the game, it is very satisfying.  So, what else have I been up to today? Not much really (again). Actually, I did put all my books from two years of GCSEs into a cardboard box, now on the floor in my room. It doesn't fit under my bed :( Time for some re-arranging me thinks. I've also beenr eading a fair bit o' Harry Potter, and I'm slowly getting through it. Pity, I had aimed to finish all five books by tomorrow afternoon, but meh. Then I aimed to finish the fourth by tomorrow. But meh. I'll settle for half way through number four, which I have achieved.   Now, what haven't I done? Firstly, I haven't watched tv for a few days, being stuck with only five channels. 'Television's a waste of time, we don't need  more  channels.' my mum will say at least once a week. So I stopped asking a while ago. I also haven't built a trebuchet yet, but I hope to do that later into the summer.  urlLink Nonnesuch  and  urlLink Megatrobe ? I think we seriously would be able to. How hard would it be? *jinx* And I haven't become nocturnal yet, but I'm not sure if I will though, for reasons stated earlier today.  AND  morse code, I've been meaning to learn that too at some point. I learnt it last summer, but forgot it through lack of use. I was only able to use it for about 3 days or so, before it trickled down out of my brain. (NB, that's one of those metamorphorical thingys that Mr 'Oh Boyyyys' Herbert went on about - basically a lie) I'd better learn it properly this year, and try to use it every day. Maybe I can post a few blogs in it, but that would make them difficult to read, so I'd better not.  AND  I have been maening to go ut with friends more, to stop me getting bored around the house. Hopefully that will start soon. Duds? I'm getting bored in here. Well, Thorpe Park on Tuesday will be good.  Business Studies. The exam will be beginning in about 18 hours. Damn again to those guys who have already finsihed theirs. I haven't revised for it, but funnily enough, I don't regret it yet. My guess is that in 19 hours and 15 minutes I will regret it, just as I leave the exam. But then, when that moment comes, there won't be anything I can do to change it, so there will be no need worrying. Problem solved! And then I will be free. Free for 10 weeks (or there abouts). Even though I've been free this weekend, it will be more genuine in 20 hours from now.  That will be all for now.  Toodles all.   Weather:  Heavy rain 30 minutes ago. Now light overcast  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  Matrix speeches in German. (I know, I WILL get round to forgeting the langauge at soem point)  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  How clever a chess computer can be  Annoyed with:  The 'finishers'  Mood:  Fine
