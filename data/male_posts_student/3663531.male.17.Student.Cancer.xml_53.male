I am of course speaking of  tampon ads.  I remember ads with blue liquid, and some happy and comfortable women. As inaccurate as this may be, I didn't care. But these lines must always be pushed, to test the limits of society. When we learn that these products are smooth "for easier  insertion " I just think we may have gone over the limits in good taste.  But what does the future hold? Condom ads, with specific and graphic recitations of their use, perhaps? An abortion institution, with details on how exactly they kill the fetus?  Or worse yet... tiolet paper ads...
