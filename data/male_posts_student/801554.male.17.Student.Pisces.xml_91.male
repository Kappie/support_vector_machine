My Chemistry teacher had a celebration for Veteran's day involving confetti-shooting cannons and red, white, and blue chemicals.  Plus some freinds of mine and I figured out how to make the confetti shoot out of the cannon more efficiently. Chalk one down for inginuity.  By the way, I love this new design.
