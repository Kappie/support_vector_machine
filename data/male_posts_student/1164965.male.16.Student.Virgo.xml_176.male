After reading your parody, I was reminded of a part in Huckleberry Finn, I don't know if you remember but Mrs. V-A called it the "mini-vacation" or something like that.  It was the scene in Huckleberry Finn where Twain is describing the sun rising over the river.  Your clear and thorough description of the events taking place and the surroundings is what brought me to recollect this scene in Huckleberry Finn.  Also, I applaud you on writing a parody-that can be a lot more challenging than cranking out a compare/comtrast paper.  So, in essence, as a Compton native would say "mad props to you, it was off the hizzle fo shizzle"
