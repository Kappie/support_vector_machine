It was worth 15 points, but I really think I got all of them right. I might be wrong though, just because I'm Colin.  Before English we got the list of classes that we signed up for in the fall. Mine are as follows:  Fantasy and Science Fiction Composition 1A Composition 1B (year long class) Civics Economics Earth Science 1A Visual Basic Programming Adobe Photoshop Technology IWE Technology IWE (semester long class that I am taking for two semesters)  English: Why do we need to learn English when that is usually our first language? Anyways, we reviewed a little bit on The Great Gatsby, took a vocabulary test and watched a movie called the Legend of Bagger something or other like that. It was actually really good and I want to watch the rest of it. I am going to read the book first then watch the movie. Mr. Taber (teacher) told me that it is actually a rather large allegory.  The time of eating at around noon: We went into the computer lab and I worked on my project some more. Now the guy flies over the handle bars as he hits the little ditch.  Basic introductions to Computers: I need to ask myself this everyday: Why am I taking this class? Anyways I am getting to be almsot done with my project as I updated before.  After school, Lenny came over for a few hours. It was cool. We were having fun confusing the heck out of Melody! (or at least attempting to) We took a picture of his car. (see: Twice Double Avatar of evilpolitician2) We played a few games and the like. There wasn't much else we did. Oh! He tried to kidnap Casdo! (see my avatar on Twice Double: It's the duck to your right) he went home at about 6:00 PM  Tomorrow I get to do nothing! Wahoo!  My dad did say I can go to the movies on Sunday with Dominique. I can't wait I can't wait!   Well I have quite a long post in a couple of posts. Thanks for listening!  "[About the humpback whale]  Dory: Maybe he only speaks "whale".  [slowly and deeply, imitating the whale]  Dory: Mmmmoooooowaaaaah...  Marlin: Dory. Dory, this is not "whale". You're speaking like "upset stomach". " --Finding Nemo
