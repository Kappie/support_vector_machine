The pollution here is bad enough without the tronking(cool word i picked up from Kass) haze. It messes around with my eyes, which are the most sensitive part of me. It was already bad enough with the chemistry experiment with sodiun thiosulphate and the smell, now the haze decides to come along too! Those people who do open-space burning are VERY insensitive, methinks. Actually I wanted to go play tennis today, but thanks to the haze, I think I'll just stay indoors.  My parents are coming up this weekend to visit me(woohoo?). It's been some time since I've last seen them. My mum has chilled out and is not scolding me now, thank God. I don't know how much more of that I can take without really exploding... I've never really exploded at my parents before, it at all. I'm getting a chair from my house(the chair at the hostel is very uncomfortable and hurts my back) and some junk food. Hopefully they'll bring up a guitar too, so I get to learn to play at least one musical instrument properly, not like memorising songs as I did on the piano.  That's all I've got for now. I'll post if I have anything more to rant or rave about, or just for the fun of posting (is it really that fun?).
