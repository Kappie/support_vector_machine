It is very intriguing how they are made, it seems like it's inviting you to help solve the crimes. They make you want to think about what's going to happen next, which very few movies make you do. They aren't really what I would consider a horror movie. The scare doesn't come from something that jumps out at you, but the way it unfolds. There is a sort of creepy sensation that you get when watching it that it can really happen, but it's just far fetched enough to know that nothing like that could possibly really take place. The most recent, Red Dragon, is the perusal to the Silence of the Lambs. This is my favorite of the three because it very effectively showsLecter's intellect rather than his savage side. It shows that he wants to help, but is stubborn enough to make the agent think, instead of giving him all of the information he needs. This is what makes the movie so exciting. The Silence of the Lambs is the original movie, and is very similar to Red Dragon. It shows the same type of intellect and mind set of Hannibal Lecter, but portrays him more of the villain. It is still a great movie. The third and final, Hannibal, Lecter is the sole villain in the movie, witch is very unsatisfying because you miss out on a lot of intellect that I love about his character. The ending is suitable, and leaves kind of a cliff hanger to allow for you to create your own ending. I think more movies should be made like these. A kind of trip out of reality, that seams like reality in sorts. A dramatic thriller that invites you to help solve the mystery as it unfolds. If you don't like scary movies, this is a rare exception, I believe that everyone should see at least one of these films. Hannibal Lecter is the greatest cinematic character ever introduced. It would be hard to create another so flawlessly. Good evening Clarice....Till next time.....
