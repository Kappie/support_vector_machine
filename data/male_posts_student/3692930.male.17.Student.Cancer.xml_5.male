Anyway I was too busy posting stuff at  urlLink [adult swim]   and I guess I enjoyed it too much wasn't productive at all. Wait a minute....yes it was! I found a link to some funny flash animations all about Mario and they are hilarious some are sad and epic.    funny ones   (some guys humming the song with drums...rocking!)  urlLink http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/mario.php    Mario dying  (it's pretty much Mario dying)  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/Funny_Blast/mariodeath.html    Sad Ones   Part 1  urlLink Part 2   urlLink Part 3    urlLink Part 4    Well that's pretty much it.  Note to self: Wake up early! You!         "Give someone a fire and he is warm for a day, but set him on fire  and he is warm for the rest of his life."
