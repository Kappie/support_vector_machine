It's been quite a journey to this stage in ourlives, and I can only hope and pray for further success to everyone.  I think that I am very lucky to have a good circle of close friends, and all the memories we've had at UTM for the past 4-5 years will be with me for the rest of my life.  It was fun while it lasted, and I look forward to the next 75 years!  Also, JL, I am very proud of you!  I am very happy to see that you were happy today :)  I'm actually laying on my bed right now listening to a Rumi CD (well actually MP3's I made from the CD) which one of my friends in class hooked me up with today.  This mystic poetry is awesome!  Oh and before I forget, I dont think I'm going to St. Maarten this weekend after all.  One of my profs decided to give us a quiz on Friday because nearly everyone plagiarized an assignment!!  No, I didn't, I cited everything, but that pisses me off.  Med students who plagiarize...that's sad!!  Also, another weird thing happened to me today.  Apparently, people around the school are hearing from profs that I'm some sort of genius or something.  Some dude who is in 4th semester told me that Dr. J. was telling him how smart I am, wtf! lol  It's funny how things are around here.  People were today, still trying to figure out what marks I had.  Sad...and funny!  Ok, I don't know what else to write...I'll write back later tonight I think.
