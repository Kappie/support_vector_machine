Over a year ago Jose Padilla was designated an "enemy combatant" because of his alleged involvement in a plot to detonate a "dirty" bomb. (Dirty bombs are conventional explosives mixed with low-grade radioactive material.) Mind you, this U.S. citizen has not been charged with the crime. Instead he is being held in a military brig without an opportunity to speak with an attorney.  Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the  urlLink Cato Institute  has  urlLink this  to say:   Obviously, to defend Padilla's constitutional rights is not to defend Padilla. If he is guilty as charged, he should never leave prison -- if he isn't executed.  Potential mass murderers deserve swift, sure and severe punishment. Genuine justice demands no less.  However, justice must be done, which means the truth must be determined through a procedure consistent with the Constitution.  If Padilla can be treated this way, any other citizen can be similarly detained. Let us hope that we can get our collective heads on straight and defend our founding document at home as well as abroad.
