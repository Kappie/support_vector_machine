What metal is found pure?' that you can take. So, Time For A Blog.  A Typical Rugby Lesson   As you may or may not know, I have had my last ever rugby lesson. Ahh... So, now seems a good time to recount my experiences.   Scene:  A windblown rubgy pitch. It is lashing with rain. Dark clouds thunder overhead, and flashes of lightning illuminate the clutch of boys that shiver in a huddle, trying desparately to keep warm hemhem.   Nonnesuch:  (All names changed to their online equivalent.)(Yelling to his friends above the wind.)  Bloody awful, isn't it? And I bet the teacher will come along now in 23 layers!  Lightning strikes the ground in front of them. When the glow dissapates, the P.E teacher, Horrible, is seen walking towards them, with a crowd of underlings weighted down under huge bags of rugby balls, foam armour, etc. As predicted, he is wearing 23 layers.   Horrible:  All right, you scum, you vermin!! Run around that tree, and back!! NOW!!!  Wearily, the boys run off. Occaisonallly one falls into the quagmire of mud, and is trampled underfoot. The rest ignore their piteous screams.   Horrible:  Right! How many of you survive?! NOW we will run around in little cricles, ORRIGHT!?!? NOW, skip like little GIRLS, you SCUM!!! NOW we have finished warming up,  (Irony of ironies. The boys are now colder than ever. The rain has now turned to freezing slush, and any warmth has now seeped out of their bodies.)  we will commence with the lesson!! I will divide HYU up into 2 teams!! OK, Masher, Smasher, Cruncher, Killer, Grinder, Pounder, Mauler, Slicer, Dicer, you can be Team One!! Now, TeraDud, Nonnesuch, Flinn, DickyBod, Jani and MegaTrobe, HYU can be Team Two!! Team two, put on the padding!!  They do so. It is flimsy and resticts movement. On the othehand, it allows body temperature to be raised to 270 Kelvin.   Horrible:  Now, your task is to prevent Team One getting through your blockade! Team One, tackle them and ruck over!!!  Team One:  RRRRRAAARRRRGGHHHH!!!!  Team Two:  AAAAAAhhhAAAAAHHHH!!!!  Team One Charge. They smash the first two defenders aside as though they were matchsticks.   Nonnesuch:  (To himself)  Come on, I can do this. I can do this.  Killer throws him aside like a matchstick. He lands in a pool of mud.   Horrible:  Excellent, Team One! I reward you for having bloodthirsty instincts and murderous intent!! Now, swap round!!  Team Two, as one man, charge at Masher, the first defender.   Team Two:  AAARRFGGHHH!!! Ow!!  (They bounce off.)   Masher:  Hur, hur, hur.  Horrible:  Idiots!! We're not here to mess around!! Do it again, properly!!!  They try again and again. Flinn is taken off in a stre...coffin. They eventually get through. They then retrieve their limbs which were left behind.   Horrible:  Now we have practiced, we will play a game!! This version of the rules is called 'Smash Your Enemies Into A Bloody Pulp Rules Rugby!!' We've all played before!! Now, I will step off the pitch and huddle with the rest of the teachers in our 23 overcoats!! GO!!!  The game is a massacre. Duh. However, the Duds are jubliant when they finish.                     THE END
