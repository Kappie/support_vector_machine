Fear not, troubled audience, for it shall not last...or at least it better not, because I have a summer to enjoy!  It does not stink that I have to get financial aid for my last year of graduate school. What  does  stink, is that no one told me that I was not going to get an extension on my assistantship. I mean, I'm over the fact that I didn't get to keep the job, but it would have been nicer to receive a phone call saying such, so that I would have felt more justified in filing for aid earlier in the summer. But no, I had to go and cross my fingers and hope.....bollocks!  So I've been running about, filing papers, rescuing coworkers from certain swallowing by swarms of drooling customers, and boy did I do some   serious   grocery shopping yesterday. I was a good boy too, and didn't buy any soda or sweets! (clapping, pausing, looking around embarrassed, and then clearing my throat as I walk away)  (slowly coming back) So um, yeah. Now that we've got that taken care of...I went running today! Yessir, exercise is back on the menu. Garsh, it feels good to get crap done. Shucks.  Okay, did you read that last part? I mean, just....what the hell is wrong with me? By the Gods, I'm such a  DORK!!!!!  (running away from myself, screaming)  Seriously, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm not quite sure what I'm capable of right now, but there's a fair chance that penguins, string cheese,and carpet shampoo might all get involved, and I  don't  think you want to be a part of that.....(hanging my head)
