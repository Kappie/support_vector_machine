So the only thing that happened me today was an exercise in drama. The exercise consisted of a classmate and I pretending our mother was seeing a man who beat her. We decided to take matters into our own hands and cut his break lines. THing is, our mom took his car and we ended up killing her. I figured it would be difficult but....wow. When my partner walked into the room with tears in her eyes...I was stunned. I know it kind of sounds stupid, but this exercise really opened my eyes to the true power of acting. When someone is so good at what they do that they can tap into their psyche and make themselves truly feel that they killed their mother and bring forth all of the feelings and reactions that accompany it... that is truly amazing. Damn. I only hope that I can do that someday. Oh, and I was a smartass to Knives today...it felt so good. Hehe. Ciao.
