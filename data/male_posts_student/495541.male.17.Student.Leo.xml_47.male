I was thinking about staying up, but I soon fell asleep and woke up at about noon.  I was supposed to get a call at around 10 from the Mediacom tech support about my internet going out.  The story goes like this: I upgraded to Windows 2000 service pack 3 and once I restart from that, my internet drops.  I call the tech support and they tell me to do a bunch of stuff.  Nothing they ask me to do fixes it.  So the nice tech support lady told me that she'd have the tier 2 support reps call me when I wanted the next day.  I told her 10 because I figured I'd be up by then but I forgot about the paper route.  I don't know if they called or not but oh well back to the story.  So after the lady told me she'd have them call me later, I was just sitting there all bummed because my internet was out.  Just sitting there on the computer is extremely boring without an interent connection.  Amazing how that is.  So I was thinking, what do I have to lose, how about uninstalling the service pack and see what happens.  I do that and baaam!  My interent comes back.  Weird!  I'm getting tired now and I'm afraid that my dad will soon come down here and yell at me because he asked me about an hour ago to go to bed.  I took a shower thinking he'd think that I was getting ready for bed then zip, go back on the comp!  Wow.  Good night.
