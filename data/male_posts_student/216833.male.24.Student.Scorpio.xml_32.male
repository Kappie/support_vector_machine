I love it, when I was walking in to the office, there was a mockingbird sitting in a tree singing.  It's wierd how when you say anything about a brid, esp. a mockingbird,  its like almost always deep and poetic.  haha.    Last night I rode out to the Evil Dirt Road to see ...of death (they didn't play).  I had a good time either way.  Last Nerve was generic and I wasn't impress. Just your good ol' hardcore eh!  Terms of Grey had an almost comical set, i love those guys, they are just full of heart.  Of coarse tyler is always cutting up with the crowd.  They had a better than usual performance.  USA is a Monster was the headlineing touring band.  They have some free mp3's at  urlLink infrasound  and also I found some info on their records at this pretty cool distro called  urlLink massdist .  I was very glad i got to see that.  Two guys from AZ coming to this little shack of a garage and tearing it up with all they've got.  It was great.  I had some awesome sleep last night.  Got home about 12 and hit the sack.  slept till about 9:15 and found some clothes and went to work.  I feel tons better than I did at the start of this week, I'm going to see Pinback tonight with lots of friends, I'm stoked. I'm looking forward to chilling out to some mellow tunes.
