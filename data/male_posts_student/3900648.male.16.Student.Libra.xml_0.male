You leave them out one night because you tired, and then it just keeps going on and on until your teeth have moved and oops! you get braces again! (that hasnt happened to me, and this isn't quite on subject)  In other news, so far I have been awake for 33 hours straight. I'm wondering just how long I can keep it up. This wouldn't normally be of much importance, if it were not that I happen to be leaving for a long backpacking trip in New Mexico....tomorrow. I'm going to meet up at my troop's meeting place around 3 pm tomorrow. We hope to leave by 4 for Union Station in LA. From there, its going to be more than 24 hours of train. After going insane for such time, I will arrive at:  Philmont. Yeah, its cool. I went with my troop two years ago, and I think its going to be great going again. We'll be on the trail for 12 days, backpacking as a crew--carrying all of our clothes, food, tents, and general gear for more than 60 miles. I think changing pronouns is bad. So anyways, its going to be much fun, and i wont be back until the 16th. I may try to keep a bit of a journal while I'm at philmont, but don't expect much out of me. Anything I do write down I'll post after I get home.  That'll be enough for now I suppose.  Time to return to the longious awakedness.
