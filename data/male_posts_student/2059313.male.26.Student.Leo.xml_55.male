It is so much easier to reflect on your day and to admire the beautiful gifts God has given to us when we are not distracted by "things"; T.V., internet, games, CD's, etc.  I'm going to make it a goal of mine to take at least one day a week to just kind of get away, to sit some place quiet and reflect and think and pray.  Thank You, Lord, for this peaceful place, my life, my friends, and my salvation.
