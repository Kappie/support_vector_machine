I've listend to every edition of the daily show that I've had recorded on my PVR. I've listened to the Michael Moore book I had on tape (he's a bit over the top, isn't he?) and I've come to the conclusion that writing these entries with my eyes closed will probably lead me to conclude that I should brush up on my typing. Then again, if you can read this, mayhaps not.  I think I'm going to see about listening to some DVD commentaries. I'm also going to think about writing some more on an article I'd like to submit for an upcoming book.Yeah, I haven't mentioned it here before, but that's cause I was just thinking about it. Now that I've got some writing done, it makes a whole world of difference.  I may boot the old notebook up and give it a whirl.
