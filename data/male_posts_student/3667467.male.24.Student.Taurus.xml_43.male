Thirty years from now, or however long it is supposed to take, I'm sure the documents will be released to show that Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld and the like were running the whole show. But is that a bad thing? I mean really. In a time where we have to deal with Middle East peace problems and threats of oil embargos, broken agreements between Israel and Palestine, and the Saudi Arabian question, who else is better equipped to lead than people who not only have experience in the area, but have actually fought a war there and won? So we know that something will get done. What we don't know is how many people will get killed, civilian or otherwise, in the Arabian subcontinent as a result of some old American codgers wishing they had done it right the first time and gone General Sherman on Saddam's regime. And thirty years from now, to look back and say this country was so powerful it would pick fights with any poor, dysfunctional kid on the playground isn't going to get us anything but dirty looks at the P.T.A. meetings. I do not fear any problems with the U.S.'s economy, infrastructure, or public security under the Second Bush Administration, but I do believe America is trying to clean the loaded gun we leave around the house. Think about the children!
