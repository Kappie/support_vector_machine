Philadelphia's too damn far away.  ::looks at map.  notes positions of Boston and Philly.  nods.::  We're just going to completely ignore this whole situation and be nice and reasonable for once in our damn lives, okay?  Okay.   I got my deployment assignment from the RNC, and I'm headed to NH to help Sununu beat the hell outta Jeanne "Do Nothing" Shaheen, and Jeb Bradley beat Martha "Income Taxes for Everyone" Fuller Clark, and Craig Benson beat What's-his-name (t.i.c.), and Charlie Bass beat Katrina-the-intellectual-midget-anklebiter-Swett.  There's work to be done, folks, and I'll be in NH from 10/26-11/6 doing the aforementioned work.    By the way (and I swear this is tooooootally unprompted.  heh)...  Meredith is the coolest girl--ever.  To explain that a bit further, Meredith knows--personally--Mike Port, the 2002 Interim GM of the Red Sox.  Meredith loves the Red Sox and the Patriots.  She actually knows what she's talking about when she talks about them.  She does like BC, though, which is far inferior to Notre Dame, but we all have our faults.  There are maybe a couple other things about her that are cool, too. (again, t.i.c.) Although she lives in Philly.  Which while a great city, is, as noted above... I digress.  So I bought more books.  Cripes.  "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt," by Edmund Morris (this is the volume that precedes "Theodore Rex," and the one for which he received the Pulitzer Prize), and "The New Thought Police," which is a scary book by the former chairperson of the Los Angeles chapter of NOW, who finally got sick of the sensitivity training and thought control bullshit the left has been using for the last 40 years to advance its agenda.  It's a rather heroic undertaking for this woman, having left NOW when she finally realized that the organization was too ugly and out of control for her to associate herself with anymore.  Anyway, I've decided to catalog my books so that I can keep track of them.  And oh yeah... Stacey (my roommate) and I are joining the Conservative Book Club (based in Louisville... that's right, Melody... they're coming to get you!)  Today I got to listen to 3 great radio shows (hold on to your skin)... got to listen to almost all of Rush Limbaugh's show, listened to the entire Howie Carr show, and got to catch the tail end of the Sean Hannity show.  Hat trick.  That's a really great day for a guy like me.  The left may have tv and movies, but we own AM radio, and that ain't bad.  So I don't know what I'm gonna do about these books.  I've got 'em lined up, and my birthday's coming up in a week, so I'll probably get a couple more then... which will back me up until New Years.  Well no, cuz I read rather quickly (and incessantly... on the T, on the boat, on the street...), so I'm sure I'll be okay, but damn... I've got 1200 pages of Theodore Roosevelt to read before reading about 500 more on Reagan, before finishing "Slander" and "The New Thought Police," before re-reading "The Shadow University"... get the picture?  Anyway, at least I'm filling my free time constructively, right?  Not slinging crack rock or gambling my life away COUGHRooCOUGH, so all in all...  I rewrote my personal statement for Berklee.  And I feel great about it.  The first version was really two-dimensional.  I was being foolish, and certainly not being nearly open enough.  And a guy who's been where I've been can afford to be open. (in fact, it'll probably benefit me even more to be open about my past, present, and future anyway)  This weekend should be fun.  A friend from the Cape is coming up and rowing in the Head of the Charles (actually, she's not rowing... she's a coxswain.  For Villanova.  That damn Philly connection again.), so the weekend should be fun, no doubt.  I'm also going down to Wheaton for a presentation on careers in music.  Hey, no matter how certain I am of what I wanna do, it can't hurt to hear more, right?  Right.  I'm worried about my Yia Yia.  The day after her 89th birthday, she had to go to the hospital.  They weren't sure if it was cancer or some other disease I can't remember or pronounce... but the woman is incredibly strong for her age, and knock on wood, doesn't suffer from the slightest bit of senility.  The woman's got spunk is all I'm saying.  And I adore her for it.  Know what the problem was?  They said her blood is too weak.  Know what they prescribed for this 89 yr old lady?  Steak.  hehehe.  That's my Yia Yia.  My family has all these incredibly strong people in it.  I'm happy to say that I'm pretty sure it rubbed off on me.  And okay, look...    Policy of the day: Election Law Evasion    Plaintiff: Honest and Decent People Everywhere.    Defendant: New Jersey Democratic Party (note for once I'm not indicting the whole damn national party)  The Defendant is charged with gross negligence of conscience as well as complete and utter disregard for the law concerning party nomination deadlines in the state of New Jersey. (which I'm tempted to refer to as a foreign country as it is.)  The Plaintiff will show that the defendant is guilty of the following abominable abuses of election laws in New Jersey:  1) The Defendant, after its candidate for US Senate withdrew from the race after the 51-day pre-election period, lobbied the Sumpreme Court of NJ to get a new candidate put on the ballot in the former candidate's place.  2) The Defendant, after being awarded the "right" to replace the now-resigned candidate, put in said candidate's place the candidate they believed was most electable.   3) The Defendant's new candidate has refused to participate in debates with his Republican rival.  The Defendant claims it is unfair to force its new candidate to debate when he has only been a candidate for 2 weeks.    4) In the Defendant's plea to the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Defendant cited the fact that "the voters of New Jersey deserve to have a choice in this election."    5) Though the Defendant has absolved its candidate of the responsibility to debate, it nevertheless has sounded the charge demanding that alternative party members seeking election to the US Senate in New Jersey be allowed to debate the Republican candidate.    In regards to 1), the candidate only withdrew when it became evident that the immorality with which he conducted himself put him at risk of not being re-elected, and thus put his party at risk of losing its majority in the Senate.  In regards to 2), their chosen replacement is a former US Senator from the state of NJ, who resigned from the Senate some years ago, deciding that politics was no longer something he wanted to participate in.  In regards to 3), evidently, the candidate is not expected to have positions on the issues in advance of election day, and is to be elected only based on his name and party affiliation.  In regards to 4), a) the Defendant ignored the 4 other candidates from smaller alternative parties who are also running for the US Senate seat in New Jersey; and b) What of the idea that the Defendant forfeited its opportunity to have a candidate on the ballot when its legal candidate resigned from the race?  In regards to 5), these alternative party candidates apparently did not exist in the original plea to the Supreme Court, but exist now, as the candidate wishes to play the equal rights card.  What about NJ's right to a fair and legal election process?  We, the people of the United States find in favor of Honest and Decent People Everywhere.  The New Jersey Democratic Party should be ashamed for its double-speak and law-dodging tactics.  How long will they wait to replace Lautenberg if he's elected?  A week?  A month?  And what of the precedent the court is setting with regard to the legal deadline for placing a candidate's name on the ballot?  May God have mercy on your souls.  Clearly democracy is dead in the toxic water in New Jersey.   That's all for now.  I'm exhausted.
