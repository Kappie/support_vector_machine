Look what I wrote in my diary yesterday:  Nothing like contact with the real world to make you realise how dull it all is. No wonder so many people live in fantasy, and as for those that don't...I am reminded of the hyponotised masses of 'Nineteen-Eighty-Four'. The bland TV, the R'n'B blaring from fashion stores; so artificial; a veil over reality. The Modern World. Yeuch.  Anyway, I've recovered now.
