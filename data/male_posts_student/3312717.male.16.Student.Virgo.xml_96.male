Maybe it's just cuz C is real cool, and with as much as H is with D, and D is with C, of course, they cross paths quite often. But that's about all I can say, really.  So now I need to find something intellectual, something non-political or religious, that we're all interested in, and can be talked about for more than two paragraphs...  I can't. Besides, I gotta go.  Quotation results tonite! Get your guesses in!
