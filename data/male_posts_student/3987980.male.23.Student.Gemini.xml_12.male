As written before, I got to met a couple of nice girls. Britney, one of my neighbors, and Ashley, who visits cause of her boyfriend there Jerrod (well so I thought. Read on....). Also there is Casey, who I generally end up conversing with. One odd day in the morning, I go out to find Ashley and Casey speaking outside the apartment. I go over to chat with them, my roommates all still sleeping. They decide to go to the movies to get outta the heat and Ashley invites me to join them. I have no reason to say no, so I go with them. Jerrod shows up and we take his car and drive around. We went up to Aloma street only to find it doesn't go to the Alafaya street. We spent nearly an hour before we turned around. We got to the movies, eventually, and had some time before it started. We decided on food. Casey went to a mexican resturant by himself. Jerrod wasn't hungry and Ashley and I didn't like mexican food. Instead we ended up at the California Pizza Kitchen. By the name you wouldn't think it, but it was a nice fancy resturant. You could tell by the prices. I got a Chicken Ceasar salad and Ashley a soup. My salad was quite excellient. Jerrod went outside to smoke, so Ashley and I got some time to just chat. It turns out she and I have some things in common. And beside her admitted "doting mother" personality trait, she was great. We finished our food and went to the movie. However, it was cut very short by a sudden blackout. So the movie was over and we went home. The next day I hung out with Jerrod and Casey during the night. It was than they told me the two of them were actually gay lovers and Britney and Ashley were a couple too. At first I didn't believe them having earlier been told that Ashley and Jerrod have a trusting relationship and Casey seemingly checking out Britney. Seems that was all just a cover since they all had bad experiences with their former neighbors. I wasn't convinced until the next day when I met their 4th roommate and Casey was still admitting to being gay. With Britney joining us later and still speaking as a lesbian, I couldn't deny their story anymore. How bad was that experience with their last place that they had to create such a elabrate show to make us all believe they were straight? And why suddenly just come out? Maybe this things are just left to be ignored. It is sad that I don't have a chance with Britney, though I'm told Ashley is Bi'. So if she ever breaks up with Britney, I may have a chance ;-). I can't really speak about my roommates much, I've been limiting my time with them seeing as they become more immature without their computers running. And now they are gone, having escape to Jacksonville to get out the blackouted apartment. I'm all alone now...
