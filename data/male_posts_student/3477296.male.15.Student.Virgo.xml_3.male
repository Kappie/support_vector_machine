The soliloquies and asides of various characters, Macbeth's in particularare central totheir development through theplay.    The soliloquy is what essentially is providing the major developments in characters and is also an outlet for their thoughts and feelings, unhindered by the rest of the play or plot. Since the tragedy ofMacbethis a showcase of how the protagonist suffers from the conspiring forces of fate, ambition and the supernatural, the soliloquies show how these forces crucially affect Macbeth.    For example, thesoliloquy spoken by Macbethin ActI SceneVII is detailing Macbeth's thoughts and motivesof killing Duncan. This is just after the arrival of Duncan into Macbeth's castle, thus presenting a prime opportunity for the incapacitation of Duncan. Here Macbeth through a soliloquy is weighing up the arguments for against the killing of Duncan. Heaccounts his loyalty andservility to his King, and that also he is his host for tonight. Also Duncan is a virtuous and benign ruler and man that when killed that his "Virtues will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu'd against the deep damnation of his taking off". As well as this, if he commits such a heinous deed, the heavens "Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye", for all to see him, and his guilty conscience. Only at the end, does Macbeth realize that it is "only vaulting ambition" that is ruthlessly driving himon.  From the above example one canclearly seehow Macbeth has expressed directly hisfrail mentality and gut wrenching anxiety towards the horrible though of killing his king. It interesting to note thatMacbeth had not thought of the wellbeingof Scotland herself as either a motive or repellent to his power gain. It seems that unlike many other tyrants of the past, the motives of vengeance, hate and misguided patriotismwere not driving factors in Macbeth’s bloody ascension to kingship and power. Here ambition is indeed a powerful force to behold.   The concept ofpower and how it is used inMacbeth is not particularly highlighted in the play as Macbeth's kingship is thankfullyonly for a brief period of time. However one can draw parallels between the period he wasin power and the heightened levels of suspicion, treachery and fear to the tyrannical societies of post WWII Soviet Russia and other autocratic countries. The muted conversation in Act III, scene VI between Lennox and a lord is an accurate depiction of how Macbeth’s ruthless desire to stay in power is affecting the people below him. The measures of security Macbeth has taken have infiltrated to the society that he governs.
