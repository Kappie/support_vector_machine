THE BLOODY WHOLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY. Baby, mother, 2 brothers and a sister and there was this short pudgy animal-like thing that kept running about, I think he's got an under devoloped mind or something.. the queer way he acts, man... Looking at me like I'm a pissin' caged attraction. Then, there were these other 2 clowns, a cousin and her boyfriend I think. DYSFUNCT SHIT MAN! I'm damn pissed about her socialising with all of them DAILY.  THIS IS GOING TOO FAR! I think my parents should stick my sister in a home of delinquent girls or something. Today's feat was a new trick that we havn't see our cunning little fox pull. Just adding laurels to the cirriculum vitae I suppose. And mind you reader, that this is the latest incident of shit that's been going on for about 2 weeks now. HELL! SHE'S REVERSING MY FAMILY'S RECOVERY COURSE LAH.  And get this! The eight circus animals which my sister brought over hadn't eaten their dinner and come over for food. WHAT THE DIPSHIT IS THIS PLACE? A FREAKING FAST FOOD JOINT AH? Bloody hell! NOW MY HALL SMELLS OF INDIAN!!! shit lah!  I just stayed in the room and played my guitar, man. I'm beginning to think that it was a mistake to have bought the bass, but what the hell...  Bloody backward people. TRUST ME READER! YOU KNOW SHIT. MY ANGER IS JUSTIFIED.   How would you like your living room to smell of Indian?
