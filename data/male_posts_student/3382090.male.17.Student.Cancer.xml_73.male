Why is that you need, tell me about your dream  Tell me when your childhood fantasy have blown away  Who’s to say you and I are here to stay  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you recognize my face in a crowd?  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me about the girl you wanna be  Will there be a place in your heart for me  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Say you will, say you will  Holding you tonight, movin’ in the dark  Time is moving faster then the world is turning  So I need to know, what is on your mind  The future seems as distant  As the sun that’s burning bright  Could it be that I’m, frightened that I might  Give it all away for souvenirs of yesterday  Who’s to say and I are here to stay  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you recognize my face in a crowd?  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me about the girl you wanna be  Will there be a place in your heart for me  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Say you will  5 winters have came and gone  And forever don’t seem to long  Will you wanna reach out for me?  Or will I be your memory  Of everything that your not now  I know that I got to stop now  You've got to tell me what’s up now  Please  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you recognize my face in a crowd?  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me about the girl you wanna be  Will there be a place in your heart for me  tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you recognize my face in a crowd?  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me about the girl you want to be  Will there be a place in your heart for me  tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you recognize my face in a crowd?  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me about the girl you want to be  Will there be a place in your heart for me  tell me where you be 5 years from now  Will you love me, still want me  Tell me where you be 5 years from now  reminiscient of last night =P  speaking of the party..changys parents werent all that happy when they came home late =/ apparently we could only have 'chicks or alchie'...one and not the other...awww...that means we cant have afterparty there =(  ive been bludging all day =/ was supposta go to lunch with mum and the relos...but cos grandma wanted to go...i err...got kicked out of the car > and i was too lazy to go catch/walk to hurrsie...oh well...going to dinner soon at 3rd aunts soon...
