I knew a few days after opening that it would never lift off and I don't wish to waste time worrying about having it do so. Anyway, That is pretty much all about my day. I will get more elaberate about my days soon enough, don't worry. I just can't right now because I think Teen Titans is about to come on. (And yes, I know it is more like a kid show then a teen show. But I like it.)  Later!     Wolfwood
