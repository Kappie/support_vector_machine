Except for the fact that *COUGH* and also Moca and her discouraged spirit. *sighzZ* Screw it...  Nima had lots on his mind and said he'd blog about it tonight but I don't think he'll end up doing it... *sighzZ* Blah...  I had... some stuff going on in my head too and yeah. Don't be surprised if I snap at you outta nowhere... apologizing in advance.  Bethel on Friday! Yay! Media Discussion. This should be good. I always enjoy that.   Last night we went out to dinner and it was cool. Peter had the coolest t-shirt ever. Haha... hilarious. Jason was being dumb (what a freak!) and Cindy and Karen... hasn't changed. :) Still my cool cousins.   Tonight... Very memorable. Why, you may ask? One word. MOCA! *cough* Ahahahaha! I'm a freak! Wee~! Okay yeah. Moca and her eye-roll. Blah.   Tomorrow's the 100th day... :) Wow... thats so... cool? It's... anti-climatic in a way... Special yet... blah? Iunno. Meh, whatever.  It's really hot right now... I'm gonna go take a shower... so much in my head... but so little to type... Blah. It'll all end up somewhere else... but not on any blog. On paper? Possibly. Anyway... I should go.  Acquired a new piccy of Nima. Haha... sexy ;)  Anyway... I'm seriously off now. Peace.  Oooh I forgot... mommy and I went to Cosmo and browsed around some guitars. Sexy guitars, man! :D Obsession with a certain black and gold one. Swweeeetttt~~~!
