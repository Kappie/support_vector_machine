I'm eating pineapple. im wondering who, if anyone, is going to read this. I wonder how long this entry will be. I wonder how long the whole thing will be. I'm wondering if i wonder too much.  Alright, well in case you dont know, my name is Matt.  I live in the town of Gig Harbor, in Washington state. I've only been living there for a year now so I'm not really sure how to describe it.  There's something about the people there that I just don't like... But there's something about nearly all people I just don't like.  I like my old town better, in Port Townsend, probably because it's more familiar than my new one.  I'm in Port Townsend at the time that I'm writing this, because I'm visiting for the summer.  Too bad all my friends won't call me back or are never home or some stupid thing.  I never get to hang with any of them.  Occasionally I question my friendships. But what can I do, but sit at home and stare at a computer screen for hours and hours, trying to escape the boredom of it all. I must admit, it does beat school though.  I wonder where all of my "friends" are right now... what they are doing... wonder if they ever care to think about me.  Maybe a blog is just something to write down all of your thoughts to let everything out, in the hope that someone will read it and care.  I hope you don't mind me complaining a lot. I wonder if anyone I know will read this. I find the chances unlikely.  I wonder if I'm writing interestingly enough to keep the reader's attention. I think I stopped caring. This blog is declared for me to look back on and reflect upon. I'll call it a night. Good night readers. I hope the next one is more interesting
