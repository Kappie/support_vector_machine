I've just been rather busy and/or rather lazy.  Your choice.  I'm really tired right now, cuz I just got home from a party (lots of drugs and sex, guys, I had a great time.  :D) and I only got 2 hours of sleep between the speech meet from hell and the party.  Btw, I got 8th for Humorous Interpretation (yay) and 2nd to last in all of my OI rounds.  Hmm.  So I'm actually alive and well.  Thanks.    Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
