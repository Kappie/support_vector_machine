On our third night at camp, Jon has homework and Jarrod and I decide to keep him company. Adam went to sleep at 12am, and David pasted out during his session of trying to stay up. Well its 12:30 and Jarrod starts asking funny questions...what would be the ideal name for a girl....and whos the hotest girl in our class (in the yearbook that is). So me and him start naming people. I said Ashley. David has a big crush on her thats why I said it. So Jarrod, Jon and I continue to talk. It then is 1:30 in the morning, and we are talking when all of a sudden...David rises up with his hand outstreched and a finger and says..blah blah blah blah (that was the jiberish) Ashley? Well, Jarrod, Jon and I are looking stunnned. David sitting there saying ashley after an hour went by without saying it. What the heck? I asked him that. He then just said..i dunno..and pasted out. LMAO!!! Well, that sure was amazing...strange..but funny. LOL David...nice one.  More shall come...tune in
