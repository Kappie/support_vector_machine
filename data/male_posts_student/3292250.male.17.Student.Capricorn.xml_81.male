Basically anything I thought about on my trip or the move that I remembered I wrote in my paper journal, so I need to weed through it and find things to blog about.  On another note, summer is winding down here. I start school mid-August. It seems really early, but I'll get out earlier in the summer, plus I'm a senior so I'm sure I'm done earlier than the underclassmen. Man it's weird to think about school. I'm off to bed.
