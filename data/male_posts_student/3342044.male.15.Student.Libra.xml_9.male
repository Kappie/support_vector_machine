The sun is just rising And dawn is far from approaching  Yet you let go And I fell again Without life  The sands fly around us and they enter my eyes I am blinded Only seeing the hand that was  Echo. The sound of every footstep. Vibrating.  Fading.  But how come? I am deaf  I shouted, but no wind To carry my voice And I am mute  Goodbye? No, useless... Night.
