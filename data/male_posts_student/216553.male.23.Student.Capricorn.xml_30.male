Then see if it is Upper or Lower Motor Neuron damage.   Anyhow, that's that. I had a brutal day of classes today. 8-10am chem, 10-12pm med term, 1-3pm neuro, and 3-5pm, more chem! By the time I got home, taken a shower, eaten, and taken a nap, it was 8pm. Then I had to goto my landlord's house to get our cable internet set up. When all that was done and when I got back into my room,there were 6 people in here waiting for my triumphant return to copy my organic homework - which I hadyet to start at that point!   I'm only done about half of it as I write this....argh.   How about a little humor for therest of the night? I'm sure I've mentioned the really cocky NY'er in my class who thinks she's the shit. Well, she and her comrades failed neuro on Friday ;) Why?Becausewe actually had to think on this exam! lol   There's what, 16 days left now?! Wooo hooo!
