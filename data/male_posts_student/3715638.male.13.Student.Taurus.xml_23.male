We get to make a human boat-shaped thing. So I'm the sail in it since I'm one of the tallest. Then at the end of the day, we all got in this big circle and we had to do a small writing thing. First, he told us some of the scenes that got cut. And I couldn't believe that my scene, The Butter Battle, got   cut   ! I couldn't believe it. Its such a good scene! But then someone said what are we going to have for scernery and the director said that he was going to may me help with some backdorps. I couldn't believe it! He thinks I can    paint   ? It might be cuz of the backdrops that I painted in the display case when you enter    PAC    from the elavator. Well, I hope they will be good ones, cuz if not,  its    my    head     on the chopping board.    Lol   !
