So close.  But a one-hitter ain't too bad.  Clearly it was a productive day.  But it's hard to get motivated after a week of work.  I'll adjust.  Next weekend I'll cure the common cold or something like that.  I feel like doing another "all-request day" for the next 24 hours or so.  E-mail me a question, comment, concern, song parody prompt, whatever, and I'll see what I can come up with.
