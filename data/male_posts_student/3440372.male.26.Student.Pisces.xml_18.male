Can't you see how hard I am working. I really am. Feeling quite good about the amount of work I am doing right now.     BOLLOCKS     I'm not actually doing any work am i?  no I didn't think so. The Internet is such a wonderful place, it offers numerous distractions from the myriad things I really should be doing.  I suppose I should go and work, Linux versus Microsoft, discuss and produce a wonderful HTML document. How much fun is that.   :: feels like a cheese sandwich ::
