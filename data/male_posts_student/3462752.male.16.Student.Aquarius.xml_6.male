All in a hurry to get nowhere, as Orkney is rather small. You have to laugh. We were greeted in the first 10 minutes by a near accident.  The cliffs and cliff stacks were fantastic, and I got a thourough use of my new 128Mb SD card for my digital camera ^_^  Saw "Nightmare on Elm Street" for the first time on holiday. Lol! What a typical 80s horror. I wouldnt exactly recommond it. I decided that in the film "Jason Vs Freddy"... Jason would definately win. =P
