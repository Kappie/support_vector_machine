I can imagine it singing Stairway. I also came within 6 feet of Eric Clapton, his wife, and his entourage. He bought cowboy boots in the booth behind ours, and I never saw him. We're selling prints of old blues musicians and jazz guys, along with some weirder (hysterical) things by George Toomer. Buffalo George, we call him. For instance: Giant Platypus flying through space. "Gallant Gals of Guadalcanal." "Don't fuck with granny!"  Greatness.  Another day, another dollar.  (JIMMY PAGE'S GUITAR  AND  ERIC CLAPTON IN ONE DAY!)
