I saw Mr James Koh (My Sec 1 English Teacher and 2004 GEP Subject Head) He was one of the Speakers, and is in the organising commitee for the Victoria Integrated Programme.  The presentation was one of those mr koh-mrs jay kind. You know those cool designs? (I could easily make them too...not boasting).Yah.  Though I sort of expected that some GEP teachers would be transferred to the VIP, I didnt expect to see Mrs Jay and Mr Lai too. They would be teaching Language Arts and Mathematics respectively. (so bizarre!!!)  At first, we were moving like a group of about 10 (class 2k!!!).. As we walked around, some strayed, leaving us with 7. This further reduced to groups of 3 and 4. in the end, these were our groupings:  1. Desmond and I 2. Lester, Sean and Yeow boon and Jeremy  3. James and Koganti. (first person to stray) 4. Jonathan was also somewhere. (3rd person to stray) 5. xue kai was with his band friends  Well there were many victorians (VS plus VJC people) there. There were also quite a lot of Dunmanians, CHIJ, TK, and people from all kinds of schools.  The preview sessions were quite okay. The lessons were just like a variant of our normal gep lessons. (anyway the Integrated Programme is focused on Gifted Education. IP is just an evolution of GEP.)But their lessons are interesting!  Marcus wasnt at VJC today. I wanted to ask him something about the VIP. He's in JC2. Nevermind.  Looks like I'll be applying for VIP... The admission test is on the 24th of July (in 2 Saturday's time)
