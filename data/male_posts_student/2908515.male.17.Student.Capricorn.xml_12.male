A place where I could post anything and not have anyone raise questions.  Of course, in order to achieve this, I had to get rid of the very thing that made up a blog; the people who read it.  Which is pretty ironic, I think.  Anyway, I never privatized my entries or hid them.  I never really hid this blogger from anyone, I just placed it somewhere where they don't look too well.  Sometimes, I feel that it would be easier for my friends to find out about this blogger than it would to tell them.  Meaning that the reason why a person has a secret is that they are too afraid to tell anyone.  Well, certain secrets anyway.  I am really scared at my friend's reactions to these rants about them.  Some rants are anti-friends, anti-parents and whatnot.  Maybe when they read this, it would be easier.  I dont know.  Anyway, Matt, when you do read this, I want you to know that I'm glad.  As you can see, I don't have any (at least I don't think so) entries about how I am anti-you.  When you pissed me off, I usually shrugged it off and sent you an e-mail.  That was my blogger entry.  It was.  I didn't reach for my blogger when things turned ugly.  I reached for my e-mail.  I always thought that I wanted an open relationship with you.  I could say anything I wanted and have it understood or at least accepted.  Call me crazy.    I am very glad that I had the chance to talk to you.  I think that you shall please your partner very much so.  Your partner is going to be very lucky and happy.  Maybe if I'm lucky, I could be that partner someday.  I will be very happy.  And very lucky.  But nevertheless, whatever the feature holds, I will be happy if you're happy.  Thanks for everything.
