I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed. Be confident in the knowledge you already have; we've all been preparing for this since the first day we signed up for AP -- just do you best. For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over!  Kailie
