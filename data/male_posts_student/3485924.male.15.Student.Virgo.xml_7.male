Still updating Wednesdays and Sundays (even though it might not look like it ^^;;).    Wow... so much to tell.  Where to begin... at the beginning!  Wait, it all pretty much happened the same day >.    So, a few days ago (Friday to be exact) my mom came home saying that she had a surprise.  Surprise turns out to be that we won a contest for filling out a survey.  We won grand prize: a gift certificate for Best Buy worth $500 (insert holy choir singing)!!!  Yeah, it's really spiffy and all, but there's one problem... my dad's spending it on a digital camera >.>;.   Bright side is that my parents are going to get my a  urlLink metal pad  for my B-day ^_^, and that my dad gave me a $50 coupon for Amazon.com (he better have!  I was the one that filled out the survey!)!  So, what do I do with this unexpected money you ask?  Why, buy games of course.  I was able to spread $50 to buy myself two games and a strategy guide ^^ (smart shopping eh? No. Now I will never say that again).    Ok, the two games were Gladius (oh what a great game that me and Alex shall enjoy playing) and Final Fantasy Tactics (not two player, but still a bundle of fun).  Yeah, so, I'll be busy playing a lot of PS2 soon ^_^.  Problem is that I need a TV to play it on (a good one, the one I have atm is smaller than my computer screen and like 15 years old).  Oh well, I can overlook that.  The strategy guide that I got is for Gladius (why not?).  So, I get to tuck in and play.    Well, the running's going pretty good.  On Friday I started running 30 minutes everyday.  I was able to run the full time (which is VERY good for me).  Now I feel all special.  I'm gonna keep running every weekday (I need sleep on weekends) and I hope that I get better.  What I really hope is that this helps me develop the endurance that I need for those hard DDR songs (^_^, one track mind).    That's about it.  Now, I PROMISE that I will TRY to update on time.  You really can't get anything better than that from me (especially since I'm going to Charlie's house that day).   I'm done for now, check back often to read some more about  urlLink me and my life !    PS: Damnit!  I want a gerbil now!
