Full of the greatest intentions to make the smooth and successful transition from dosser to upstanding member of the community, what could possibly get in the way of this epic feat!?!   Natural disaster ?  Couldn't possibly be   Imminent alien invasion ?  Don't be so ridiculous    An obligation to follow the mighty Exeter City on a Sambaland pilgrimage to Rio ?  You bet your ass!   What could possibly be more important over the next 2 months than raising the Â£999 required for the  urlLink trip of a lifetime . Thats right. Nothing.  " The name's Ronaldo. Andrew Ronaldo ."
