They may not have scored tons of goals, but they've beaten the previous cup holders and the host nation. They haven't even won a single game in any previous international tournament and lost their first two qualifying games. Moral of the story; the giants can always fall and the underdogs always have a chance of winning. I just wish I'd put down Greece to win on the pre-tournament betting odds!       This morning I had a really lazy lie-in, then got up and played PES3 for about two hours until lunch. In the afternoon, I had a big tidy up of my bedroom, clearing all the crap off of my desk and moving various items around until it looked much clearer. I would have finished off a review that's been hanging around for a while, but the cup final got in the way of that.  Tomorrow's a normal school day, or it should be anyway.
