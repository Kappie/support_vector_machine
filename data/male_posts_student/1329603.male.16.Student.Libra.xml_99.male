I really haven't had a very interesting day, sorry.  Oh, but I've got to play at a funeral tomorrow. Bugger...  Quote of the day: "No, Baron de Thenard', The circles I move in are humbler by far. Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you are?!"  From   The Wedding Scene   From the musical   Les Mis√©rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
