With barely any food and water, she looked older than she should of done for a once beautiful twenty four year old woman who had long blonde hair, hair which was now beginning to turn white with the dust from the house. Her capatives had not actually been mean to her, they had taken her hostage to prove a point to the world and to her father, but no one had seemed to listen to them or even care, what was the world coming to when no one cared about a beautiful young woman beginning missing for almost a year.
