DUH! so when do i start? well, if you read my journal 2 posts ago (entitled **i faced my fears and got lost in my mind today**), you will see that i already have taken the step forward in getting better. now, posting here USED to be something that i would do for theraputic reasons--to get stuff off my chest. i gave the web address to a few close friends, so that they could pray for me...and from my understanding, i now have more then 20 ppl reading this weekly...uhh, ok? but no one comments--thats what really annoys me LoL! its like: who am i posting for now? am i posting for me, or for the audience that may or may not exist? if you do truly exist, and you do read this crap i write in here, then PLEASE COMMENT ONCE IN A WHILE! LEAVE ME A LITTLE QUIP!! OR JUST EMAIL ME!! mncmshs@comcast.net  come on now friends (and family--laura heh)...help me out a little bit. i always like to hear encouraging things from ppl once in a while. ill be on the computer for another few hours if you want to talk to me...ok? bye
