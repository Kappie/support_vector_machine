While getting our coffee and frappes, Mom asked if someone could use her card without her being there. They said yes if you can give the phone number on the card. Score! This is like Hermes coming down from the sky and saying ambrosia, food of the gods, is now 10% off. I'm a regular at our Barnes and Noble and can commonly be found staring at any title, but mostly in the sci-fi/fantasy or Christian sections.  Finally, got to turn in the application to you-know-what. One step closer. Now I have to pay the $40 fee.
