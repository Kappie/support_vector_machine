Heres the site. http://wonderboyblog.blogspot.com/2004/08/whos-that-guy.html thats the site. On to the idea of this post. I'm so fucking sick of my family. There all hypocrits. My fathers a condescending asshole, since Tommy got a job I have to hear all this  need a job bullshit. While Tommy gets away with murder till he's 17 just because he gets good grades. "When are you going to start paying for stuff around here I mean your mother just took you school shopping." Yeah cause Tommy only went 2 weeks before me and Catherine 1 week before me. My mother claims my summer school which costed $220 so I cannot by any means necessary be put through driving school (It costs too much.). But Tommy's increasing tution ($5800 a year)  shouldn't be considered, oh wait he was put through driving school. Realize that Tommy's school costed well over $20,000 over not under or close but well over (Freshman year= $4800 Sophomore =$5000 Junior = $5300 Senior = $5800 TOTAL = $20,900) and lets not forget the fact that they want us to sell 4 $30 calenders or foot thge bill ourselves. Bullshit. I cost taxes maybe $120 for public school and lets say $200 for polaris (my vocational school) Hum. Tommy = $20900 Pat = $420 so we can't possibly put me through driving school. Catherine well she just gets everything she wants and in the process intentionaly gets in the way. Tommy, Well I can't blame him for being intellegent but I can blame him for being an ass about it. We've lived in this current residence for 3 years, he has yet to cut the grass once. Come on do some work other then school. Its not that I think I have it so bad, but Jesus Christ when I can't go over Cat's because Catherine needs to spend 2 hours on the phone with that fuck faced whore Julia I tend to get aggrivated. Shit, I ask to see Cat at least twice a week Mondays at bible study and Friday wherever we choose. Fuck this family I think I'll sue for the $20,480 difference I got fucked out of then I'll put myself through car class($300), buy a new Mazda 3 ($16,000) and pay insurance/gas with the last $4180. Also realize that my insurance would be $100 not too bad.
