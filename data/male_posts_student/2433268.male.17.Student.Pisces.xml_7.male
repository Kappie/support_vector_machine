Monday night I went to the Embassy Hotel up in Cleveland where the Army put me up all expenses paid.  (They spoil you rotten before sending you to stripped down boot camp don't they?)  Had great food, learned many things about women ;-), lol.  There was this enlisting Marine leaving for basic and he took us around Cleveland to the various bars and other establishments.  For some reason he called the fine looking women beavers, never did get an explanation of that.  But hey, some things just don't need explaining.  Tuesday morning we all got our 4:00 AM wakeup call, oh god the pain!!! Then the bus took us down to the MEPS (Military Entrance Processing System) building down south a bit, at which point the entertainment began.  First we had our breathalizer test, just to make sure that we hadn't done anything stupid the night before, followed by vision test, ears, etc. Standard stuff.  Took a blood sample, and oh man do I not like needles.  The real highlight of the day tho was the "Underwear Olympics".  Imagine a room full of tired guys in their boxers performing various excersizes and activities to prove they are not deformed, such as a duck walk, kick start a bike, things like that, and you'll probably get an idea of how stupid we all looked.  After that it was just mainly waiting, signing the paperwork, I got the job I wanted!!!  96B- Military Intelligence Analyst I know what CNN doesn't :-P  But anyways, took my oath, and went back home and feasted (can't eat while your there), and we were there from roughly 5AM till about 4PM ugh.  But after all of it I was feeling pretty good about myself.  Took wednesday off because I was too tired to do anything, thursday was just busy with various chores, excersizing and the like, I've lost 11 lbs. so far, need to at least lose another 9 to not look like a total slob, friday-saturday attended my grandparents 50th anniversary.  How they stayed together that long will always be a mystery to me, but I'm happy for em.  Then of course today I'm just nice and comfy after a day of food I really shouldn't of eaten and video games I really shouldn't of played :-P Had to splurg a bit.  I'll post more laterz but I think that's enough for now!
