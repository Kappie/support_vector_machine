She's liable to give us a rediculous final that I don't even understand, or maybe she'll give us a final where all the multiple choice questions are wrong and we're forced to pick wrong answers (happens once or twice on every test we take), or maybe her personal favorite: grading our tests wrong so that we get lower grades.  She did it to us on our midterms during this marking period and she misgraded a few problems on my last test, and one on my test before that.  I just want a sensible test; if we have a sensible test, I'll ace it because after all I am an A student in math--but I just know we're not going to get a sensible test.  It's a very slight worry as I've put it in the back of my mind and frankly, 90% of me doesn't give a fuck how the final goes but there's still 10% that's worried she's gonna fuck me over.  I'm so happy that she's not returning to teach at our school next year, not because I won't have her--I wouldn't have gotten her again anyway but because the up and coming kids wont have to endure her psychosis.  Her departure is a real service to the kids continuing Math-B next year.  My finals officially end on Monday.   Tomorrow I have: Global History Final Day 1 (Thematic essay) English Final Day 2 (Continuation of in-class literary essay) Math Final Day 1 French Final Day 2    Monday I have: Global History Final Day 2 (Multiple choice) English Final Day 3 (Just in case I'm still not done with my essay) Math Final Day 2    Then the Global History regents go down on the 17th and the Chemistry regents go down on the 23rd I believe.     Then I'm all done.  I am going to be so pleased after fourth period on Monday.  It will mark the culmination of a very successful year where I made a lot of new friends and grew in many ways, rapidly at that.  I think back sometimes to as little as four months ago and find myself having drastically changed in some respects.  Next year will be my hardest year of high school to date--but at it's end I'll essentially be done with all  real  high school work.  Next year I'm taking three AP courses--AP Bio, AP U.S. History, and AP English.  I'm going to be taking four regents exams: U.S. History, English, Math B, and French--not to mention the three AP exams.  I'm not sure yet whether an AP exam substitutes for a regents exam--if they do then I wont need to take the U.S. History regents or the English regents.  I can't wait for the summer vacation to start.  I hope I get called for work so I can make my bones and buy me a new computer.  Ok now I must do my last real homework of the year.
