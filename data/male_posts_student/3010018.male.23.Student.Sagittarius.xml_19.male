Yea, i didnt think so !  = ) just playin....oh and anyone thinking about buying Sega Espn Basketball...DONT (it sucks)  Now about the real NBA......WOW, what a couple of nights to be watching the playoffs, the Spurs-Lakers Game 5 was a classic with an amazing ending, I was screaming at the top of my lungs at the end....it was amazing.....I hope the Spurs beat the Lakers in Game 6 cause I dont like the Lakers......And then tonite the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons are playing in Double OT!! oh man what a game, Chauncey Billups hit a 37 foot jump shot as time expired in regulation to tie the game and send it to overtime....now neither team is playing well offensively but its exciting to watch an overtime game.....an overtime, extra innings, sudden death overtime, its just soo much excitement and fun to watch....now i must go back to watching basketball......
