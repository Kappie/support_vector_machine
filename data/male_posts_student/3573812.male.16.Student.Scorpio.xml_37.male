I know I do.  I was almost asleep when I suddenly thought of a much better title for my latest post.  I went into my mum's room and said 'Iforgottodosomethingonmyblogsoi'mgoingonthenetit'lltakelessthanfiveminutesiswear'.  For some reason (?) she didn't understand what I had said, but as soon as she heard the computer turn on she said 'No more than five minutes!'  About thirty seconds later she was yelling.  'Hurry up Taeghan, you're f**king me off!'  And I'm sitting there thinking 'I'm your angst-ridden teenage son.  Has it maybe crossed your mind that I don't give a shit whether I'm f**king you off or not?!'  I got to sleep at about 12:40 am.  Then I got up at 7:00 am.  I went to work and was so happy that my bitchy supervisor (Michelle) wasn't there, Lynda (who's cool) was there instead.  This happy mood lasted until I got back from my first break, when I realised that I may be coming down with the flu.  Needless to say the rest of the day was far less enjoyable.  I just sat at my checkout most of the time, staring into space, talking as little as possible and hardly ever smiling at the customers.  Anyway, I've whinged enough for one evening.  I'm just going to sit here and wait for someone to come online.  Kisses.
