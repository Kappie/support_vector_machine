PS my classmates for the school band concert coz I dun feel like going as the band sux though it may have a little standard. Kena force so shall not go, I dun mind wasting a ticket. Got whine at by my shi mei aka julia who has also so helpfully assisted me in my blog. Thks alot if you are reading this. Neway back to the point, she was whining at me to help her contact pple. Ah well, not that I mind since she helped me with my website. But i juz could not finish my own work. But in the end I still agreed. Opps gtta go, my sis need to slp again.
