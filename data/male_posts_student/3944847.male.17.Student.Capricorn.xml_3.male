And then I watched tv and study until 4.00pm...Then I prepared to go to the buffet dinner because my friend was going to pick me up from my house at 5.00pm... Around 5.00pm , my friend came and pick me up to Sutera Harbour with another friend together... After 10 - 15 minutes ride , we reached there... There were a lot of people prepared to run for the 7k... That`s when we knew we went there too early... So we decided to sit in the "magazine room" and wait for other friends... Not long after that , she came... 4 of us went to the "sea side" and decided to wait other friends there... At 6.45pm all was present... We went for the buffet dinner at Five Sails... She was sitting beside me , both of us was embrassed... At 8.00+pm , her friend came and joined us... After the dinner , me , her and her friend went for a walk around... We also took some pictures... We did talked a little and having a chat... It was all fine... Then , her friend told that she wanted to have a little talk with her so I gave them a little privacy and went back to find my friends and they walked away... Soon , the fireworks started and I can`t see both of them... As the fireworks finished , there I saw her and her ex together... Everything was turned into pieces... She also walked pass me and didn`t even say a goodbye... I was so speechless and just watched them walked away... Now I felt that swords are stabbing my heart... I also understand why people said that girl`s tears flow from the eye while boy`s tears flow from the heart... My heart is bleeding now... Real pain came to me... Maybe my friends are right that she had rejected me from quite sometime...Maybe I`m just a friend to her... Everything seems to be hopeless... I`m just too sad to blog longer...
