I know that I need to start on part two of Desensitized by Green and Black, but for now, everyone can wait. I need to relax a little. I've been looking for a job. I hate child labor laws, they can suck my dick. If I could I would work all day and probably all night. I don't need money that bad, but my dad was telling me to start saving now. He said something about if you had enough money, you wouldn't have to worry about losing your job. I know what he said, I just can't remember it enough to write about it, with out it sounding really dumb. I've still got nothing to write about, and I think it's been like, 2 days or something since my last post about having nothing to rant about. Things are good here. I went to my cousins baptism last night which was completely retarded. The trip to Williamsburg to see the family has been canceled because my dad forgot and doesn't have time or something like that. Well, I'm gonna go cut the grass now, and then mop the floor, and get paid. Maybe I'll have enough [money] to get Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow when it comes out.
