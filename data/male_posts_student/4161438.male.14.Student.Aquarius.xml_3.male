Kyra's Birthday:  Kyra Horton, my best friend since Grade Three, had a birthday on August the eleventh. (I was reminded on August the ninth.) My other friend, Colin Watts, oblivious to the significance of the eleventh, informed Kyra that he was holding a generic party on the twelfth. It did not take long for this party to be corrupted into Kyra's birthday party.  I presented my gift on the birthday proper, by the way. I rented both volumes of Kill Bill, and because that only cost me four dollars, I gave her the spare loonie. ^ ^  In any case, the party! One of the best I've been to, I must say, regardless of the fact that it dripped of immaturity and that the pool was a miniature. The thing was immature because Kyra and Colin are decidely so, as were many of the guests. There was no beer, there was no making out in the corner, and so on and so forth. Only a few people there probably have ever been to a hardcore party, to be honest. But hell, it was a party of friends, and it was fun. ^ ^  I came to the party with Kyra, Kirsten Kukula, and Kirsten's parents. (Who else would drive the car?) As a bit of background, Kirsten is a good friend of both Kyra and Emily, though Emily and Kyra don't particularly like each other. (Something about Emily wronging Kyra in the fourth grade, I dunno. Pretty idiotic to still hold a grudge.) Kirsten is from a German background, and is  very  proud of her heritage. She is also very Christian (a real bible thumper) and has on more than one occasion tried to convert the atheist Kyra, the Wiccan Emily, or my mildly Christian-Hindu self. On all occasions she's been quite unsuccessful. All that said, while she may not approve of a lot of things, she'll let it fly, and only warn you once every three months or so. Besides, she's not perfect herself, having cut a cross into her flesh with a can opener and sneaking around behind her parents' backs to meet her boyfriend. She fits in well. ^ ^  So, we arrive at the party. Waiting outside were Jackie and Megan. I don't know much about Jackie. She's just a girl that hangs around school. Megan is a friend who I became a bit estranged from last year. I started hanging around with a different group then were at this party - Emily and Kirsten among them - so we didn't see each other as much, and this was actually a major get-together for Megan and all the other people who both lived out of town and I didn't see much at school. In any case, Jackie and Megan were playing basketball as Megan's mother, not yet out of the driveway, was talking to them. Colin's little brother was on the deck, waiting for his dad to take him golfing, I believe.  So, yeah, after a little while I go into the basement, where I was greeted with blasting music, strobe lights, plasma lamps, and various other optical feasts. The music was mostly Gob, Sum 41, Hoobastank, people like them. Pretty good, if a little generic. He had good food though. Blue Kool-Aid is better than Jean Chretien on a good day, and gummy bears top even that. And he had all dressed chips!  !!!  So, yeah, skip skip skip, the pool. Now I didn't know Colin had a pool, and if I had I am most sure I would have taken something to swim in. But I didn't know, and I didn't take anything. So I stole some of Colin's shorts, and off I went. And that was the best part of the party. For a good chunk of it, I was alone in the pool with Jackie, Kirsten, and Danielle, a good friend I've had since she played on the same baseball team as I did in Grade One. Yes, very far back. I learned one thing about Jackie that day: hyper. You could not relax in that pool, at all. Why? Because Jackie wants to kill you. ^ ^  Later, however, some people who had been inside trickled outside, prepared or no. Kyra jumped right in. (I'm wasn't getting my clothes wet! I like Colin's couches too much. They is the comfy. Plus I'm an exhibitionist.) Long story short, there are a lot of people in a very small pool, most wearing clothing and all seeing what it might be like to drown; Jackie was very demonstrative.  Skip skip skip, I am at the nearby playground, where the party has shifted to, and who do we meet? Bill! For those of you who don't know, Bill was driving to Moncton on a motorbike when he realized he wasn't going to make it by nightfall. So, he settled down for the night in the red plastic tube of Pleasant Valley Park's jungle gym. We brought him food. ^ ^ Another great accomplishment of the night was he managed to squeeze  six  people in that red plasic tube! That's a lot. Megan was just over halfway in, and I climbed on top of the knees of all the people within; Axe had to grab my hand and pull me so I could actually get in. (Axe is my given name for Joel, a person I met for the first time at the party. I didn't find out his real name until the end; he told me near the beginning, but 'Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous' was too loud for me to hear it.)  While Pleasant Valley Park is very much illuminated by street lights, almost none of this light spills over onto the adjacent field; it is veiled in shadow at, the stark contrast of the bright park and it adding to the deepness of the black. And was it ever a perfect place to see that night's meteor shower. Granted, I only saw two against the velvet, diamond-studded sky, but I had to leave before midnight, after which there was supposed to be one meteor every minute. (I must say, I was very pissed at my mother at that point, though it passed.) In any case, only four more meteors were seen that night at my house; the many street lights where I live make for a lot of light pollution.  My one qualm about the party. Emily couldn't make it. :(  However...   Emily's Birthday:  Emily was originally having her birthday party on the twenty-eighth, although she says she's going to change that. My sister and her fiancee, Jorg, (yep, I got the name, and it's pronounced like 'yoge') are coming to Sussex on that same day, and I really didn't want to pick girlfriend or sister. So, she's changing it the twenty-fifth most likely. In any case, this party will be decidely smaller. It will be only me, Emily, Kirsten, Kirsten Smith (a crazy friend of Emily's who lives out of town; I've met her only once, but spoken to her on MSN Messenger quite a bit), and Mitchell, Emily's both hilarious and obnoxious cousin.  Emily lives way out of town in Norton, which is a part of Greater Sussex. It's a farming community that is composed largely of hicks and drunks, homophobes and racists. However, Emily's family is rather unlike the majority of those assholes, both in that they wouldn't throw rocks at black people and in that they actually make some money. That's not to say Emily's family aren't assholes in their own respect though. I've met Emily's stepmom but once, and found her rather nice, though she may be deceptively so. She has definitely wronged Emily in many ways; due to way Emily presents herself, she feels she is something of a drug addict, kleptomaniac whore. Emily is in fact a virgin, and has only rarely drank small amounts of beer. And no, she doesn't steal.  In any case, with luck, the stepmom will not be a major roadblock to the party. It's unlikely she will be, as she knows all the other guests. However, I, the newcomer, could be in her mind a manwhore poised to fuck her stepdaughter. (Sure, it's on my mind, but Emily deserves better, and because I know she doesn't want sex with her previous boyfriends, I'm not imposing.) I just hope I made a good first impression; in retrospect, I believe I was silent and respectful. Probably only because she didn't say anything that was stereotyping or some such.  But the party! The negative bits aside, let's get the good stuff. ^ ^ I need to buy Emily a present of some sort, though I am not sure as to what should be chosen by myself. However, I am bringing baked goods of some sort. Cookies? Cake? Brownies? Gotta love your mother being a wonderful cook. :D I'm going to ask her soon what she wants. And guess what? Emily has a pool! I get to show off my sexy body! Oh, and swim... ^ ^   Kelly and Jorg:  Yup, I mentioned Kelly coming over on the twenty-eighth. It'll be the first time she's come over since she visited in February of 2003. That's about a year and a half ago! And, yup, she is bringing her fiancee with her. Jorg, from Germany. The only German I know is 'Ich ben ein schwein,' which Kirsten told me meant 'hello.' That was a pretty fun party, considering it really means 'I am a pig.' I can't wait to meet the guy, nor can I wait to see Kelly again.  This'll be the second time Kelly has brought someone interesting to our house. (I find anyone from different cultures very interesting, seeing as I live in a very conservative, monocultural part of Canada, in stark contrast to the beautiful ethnic mixes of Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal.) The last time was in Grade Four, when Kelly visited for Christmas with Cindy, an exchange student from Costa Rica. I didn't fully appreciate what Costa Rica was at the time; all I knew was that they ate spicy food and spoke Spanish. If I had just known the questions to ask... ^ ^  Jorg and Kelly will be staying at our cottage at Pokeshaw for a few days, an Irish community on New Brunswick's predominantly Acadian North Shore. (The Rierdens, a very nice Irish family, own it, but allow us to use it.) Dad and Jordan are going to drive up there and retrieve them on the twenty-eighth. I lost in the coin toss, though to be honest, I was hoping to lose. I did not want to be in that car for the whole trip to Pokeshaw; it's not exactly pleasant. However, I showed interest because it would hurt my dad's feelings to not care. (Technically, we could fit five people in the car, but that would be a furnace.)   Thailand:  Thailand is my goal. I will get to Thailand, and with luck, I will be in Thailand at the start of my Grade Eleven year. (I'm starting my Grade Ten year in September.) My method of getting to Thailand: the Rotary Club Youth Exchange. To be accepted, I need good marks. Check. And I need a good attitude. Check. And, though not necessary, it wouldn't hurt to learn a little of the language. (Sawatdee khrab! Chorb ar-han phet!) So, I think I'm a shoo-in. Besides, the Rotary Club Youth Exchange is  cheap , and if I am accepted, I am gonna rely on Sussex, a town I love despite its various shortcomings, to pay the few expenses. Because they will send me there, because sending someone to Thailand is something that doesn't happen often here.  And I know I'm gonna love it in Thailand. A beautiful landscape, a rich Buddhist culture, friendly people, one of the safest countries in Asia, and not too mention the great cuisine, the great art, and the beautiful language whose intricacies I have yet to fully unravel. Even the history is dramatic! (Thailand is the only Southeast Asian nation never conquered by a European power, among other things.) It's the perfect place to live in as a teenager. ^ ^  Which is why it's my goal. I will be in Thailand. Nothing will stop me. Even if I can't go next year, I  will  go. No question.   Iceland:  Now, Thailand is my goal, but Iceland is certainly looking a bit more accessible. My father made a lot of friends around the world in his traveling years, and apparently, I have a free place to stay in Reykjavik, "if I ever want to go." Which I do. A lot. So long as it doesn't interfere with Thailand. As much as I like Iceland, it's the newcomer, and I've got fixed priorities. ^ ^  Which is why I am thinking I might be able to go to Iceland for January, February, and March. Won't interfere, I'll learn the basics of being a goodwill ambassador, I'll learn a lot about Iceland and Icelandic culture, and I might even come out with a third language under my belt. (Icelandic counts as four languages, actually, as it is mutually understandable with Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish.) :D Not to mention Iceland is one of the coolest countries in existence. No military and it opposed Great Britain. Descended almost exclusively from about four hundred Scandinavian settlers. Earthquakes are as exciting as breakfast. Overwhelmingly weird, overwhelmingly hip, and overwhelmingly blonde, that's the way I'd describe Iceland. ^ ^  And I really want to go!
