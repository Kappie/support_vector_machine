I mean yeah i'm gonna go there but blah its not all that interesting there are 1 or two things about it, for example, the amount of nice people there and the fact theirs no uniform, you dont have to do subjects you dont want to and you go out during free periods. Thats all cool but generally its not the spiffiest place I've ever been too, its quite run down to be honest but It'll do me.  Anyhow yes planning to re-decorate my roomiau so it will have more space which should be uberly cool cause I love my room but theres not nearly enough free-space in here, and I know most people would think "well why have free space if your not going to do anything in it?" and thats true but I feel kind of closed in and its too dark aswell so Im painting my walls LIME green and my cieling blue and getting a single bed instead and just moving a few things around, packing things away so theres less clutter, so hopefully it will be all the better. Guitars going well, I have to say that apart from the obvious webdesign its the one talent that I'm proud of cause alright I'm not the greatest amateur guitarist in the world but I'm working my ass off with it, I practice every day for atleast an hour or more. But meh.  Yeah me, Scott and Ben decided that Coffee #1 will be our hang out for college cause its all nice like that! I think i've decided what I want to do and thats Media and Film studies, Psychology and Politics so hopefully that should be fun. Theres alot of nice people in the college, I met a guy called Matt who was quite cool - like me he just wanted to go to sleep so thats all good. And a girl called Sophie who was pretty sweet, she likes the same music as me so we talked about that for a little while. Ben was cool (Gentle Ben) yeah, hav'nt seen the guy in ages so it was great to see him again.  Socialising at the moment has been a bit of a problem due to the fact that I'm too tired to do anything, Holeys party-esque thing is on saturday and one: I dont have any money, two: If i'm honest as much as I would like to see the guys I'm WAY too tired to go. Im not kidding, last night I went over Charli's new house, so I got home from college, and had like an hour or something before I had to go so I flicked on the TV and Ice Age was on and I fell straight asleep, her phone call woke me up 45 minutes later when she asked "Is alright If we come now?" It's been like it alot lately, I fell asleep on the bus the other day and had missed my stop but luckily the stop I got off at wasnt far from the one I needed. I dont know why I'm so tired and thats what bugs me the most, I dont stay out or up late and Im always full of energy but Im just really tired lately.  So yeah Roar didnt come over in the end which sucks cause I was looking forward to seeing the guy, playing gamecube and the such. I MISS NICK! Sorry but I do, really everyone does, things really arnt the same when Nicks not around to either laugh, make jokes, get angry, seem drunk or screw things up. Its not long before he's back, I got Disney soon which will be UBERLY cool. Got to get ready for that though, anyhow despite the fact my dogs in a phase of pulling my bed sheets apart im going to sleep again, i should be in college right now but Im too tired...
