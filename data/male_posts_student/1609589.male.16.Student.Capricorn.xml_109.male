I swear to god, the next person who gives someone i don't know my screenname is NOT going to have their legs very much longer.  There is a little trend going around where you share your whole buddy list with someone else.  DON'T DO THAT!!!!  Screennames are private property, and are NOT allowed to be given to ANYONE else without MY permission!  I'm too pissed to talk about this right now, I need to try and get some sleep, I have church in the morning(Not christian church, get a life.)
