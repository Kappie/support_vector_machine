Well, maybe it's because I was the only one that stayed up, or maybe it's because I was doing something constructive. Yeah, maybe if I was doing something stupid like partying... and had a bunch of friends over, it would've been a blast...  ps: I acted like an idiot in church today... maybe it was the lack of sleep...
