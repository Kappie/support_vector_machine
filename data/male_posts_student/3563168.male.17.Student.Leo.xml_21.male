Every time I would touch my ear, the sound would continue, as if something was in my ear shaking around, which was totally weird. I tried digging something out, and after a while, the sound just stopped.  It was really strange, but since it's over with, I figure it couldn't have been that bad anyway.  I also figure I'm gonna let my beard grow until I have to go into public, just to see what it looks like. I mean, lots of badasses have beards, like Chuck Norris.  If you aren't satisfied with this post because it's not funny or clever, then too bad, because I don't have anything else to write about for the moment. Instead you can e-mail Chuck Norris and tell him how awesome he is.
