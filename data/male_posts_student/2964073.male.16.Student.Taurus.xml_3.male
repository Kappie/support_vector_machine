It is a challenge familiar to many a business owner. One  sure-fire way to get your business noticed online at  minimal cost is to sit down and write about it - or  commission someone else to write about it for you.  Promotional or advertorial articles have traditionally  worked well to publicize businesses offline in magazines,  newspapers and circulars. Now, the Internet offers a  myriad of web-based opportunities in the form of  specialist news sites, portals, on-line newspapers, ezines  and newsletters - all of which require a source of fresh   interesting content. But where should you begin?  What do your customers read?   You should first consider the types of material your  potential customers will read and where they will view or  download that material from. Perhaps they subscribe to  specific online trade circulars or newsletters published  by a site or magazine they subscribe to. Look to cover all  the options and where possible obtain subscription data so  you can determine if the target audience of a publication  matches with the audience for your product or service. You  will have little success if you target the wrong audience  who have little interest in what you are selling.   Making the content work for you  Developing the content for your article is obviously  critical to your success with this marketing method. It is  also important to realise that whilst some editors will  accept promotional material, others will not. You will  therefore need to think carefully about how your article  is constructed. One way to approach this is to have a few  different versions of the piece to hand ~ from one that  overtly promotes your product or service to one that does  so more subtly. You can then choose which version to  submit to the editor based on their preferences.   An effective publicity angle for those that do accept some  form of promotional advertising in an article is to  present your product or service as a solution to a  problem. To increase your chances of publication, look to  base it on topical events. For instance, if you are  selling anti-spam software you can base it around a piece  that discusses the implications of the latest laws against  spam. If you do not have the time to pen such advertising,  then an alternative is to have someone interview you about  a topic, and ask them to put the material together for you.  Advertising your business through promotional online  articles works wonders for businesses all around the  world. Make sure you don't miss out on this global  promotional opportunity.    Scott F.
