It was a very laid back kinda practice in the early going cuz all we did was work on our hitting, then we did a "team-on-one" which was very crazy, and then we jus scrimmaged. Then at like 11:50 me and brian went to the beach to play wit dan, chris, mark and then dane and nick showed up, i played wit chris we got killed by brian and dan, yeah i suck at the beach now, its horrible. Then me and brian went wit dan to go to laguna high school to help him scout laguna and cate. When me and b showed up, they had...A LACROSSE GAME!!!! so we went ova there to watch and it was bad ass. This one foo got freakin body checked like crazy, it was awesome. Then i got a kick ass shit cuz i hit a chair ova during a drill and if we did we got a shirt, so i got the shirt, and we basically watched horrible volleyball the whole time. Then we stopped at the mall over there and me and b went to pac-sun and got 2 trucker hatz cuz they had a buy 1 get 1 free thing goin on, so it was bitchin. Then we went to girlz shoten practice at 7 and it was kinda alright. I won all the 2 man drillz i didnt want to run, but i almost didnt win when i was wit valeria cuz shez jus...GAH!!!!...yeah, but i still won it cuz i had enuff determination and anger left in me to play, so yeah...pretty good but busy day...payce outside.
