Then July annihilated it (XP). Today, I took my final behind-the-wheel. I guess I've been relatively lucky. I got a two really nice people and a lady who at least had common sense and good advice. I don't know if I've practiced enough, but I definitely don't want to become a DWO (driving wild oriental). I'm prolly going to be a middle driver. Like, not an excellent driver, but not a terrible one. My problem, though: I get so nervous behind the wheel with other people. As if their judgment will crush me. All the DMV person has to do to fail me is to make a big deal out of something like a missed point. My morale is so fragile. I don't take criticism too well, even constructive criticism, when it's in that tone. That tone of OMG- TERRIBLE ! I break down. I can tolerate a lot of things, believe me, I can be a very patient person with others, but that, I cannot handle. It just gets to me when I know I did something wrong and someone else opints it out. My kryptonite. _One thing I can talk about. My body. what a disappointment. It keeps failing me, and making me angry. It's so awkward and stupid. It's falling out of shape (more my fault, but still!). I know I abuse my body's limits, but it can at least try to keep up, right? Muscles. Problem? I don't have any (>_ _AP scores have been coming in. Apparently, this last year's AP calculus class all passed with 5s and a few 4s, with one not heard from yet, that's so incredible! Personally, i got a 4 in AP U.S. history and a 5 in Biology. I was so happy about biology. To some extent I guess I have to give credit to Mr. Cornelius. Even though I felt totally unprepared for the test, it turned out okay. I guess whenever I rush through things like that, it just doesn't occur to me, or maybe I'm just a lucky bastard (;D). Hell, I'll deal with luck, I'll take the bad if it gives me good on tests. Doesn't seem like the AP chem-ers did all that well. I was actually surprised by a few, but I didn't think it would be this bad (no harm meant towards the test takers, just that the class wasn't taught all that well, I guess, I dunno). This year has definitely been an eye-opener. So many things revealed themselves to me (hahaha, that didn't come out right) and I feel like I've grown so much mentally, perhaps, not on a social level, but you know what I mean. I just know that our future is tugging at us, and we simply cannot afford to ignore it. Some are more prepared than others. That's all for tonight, if I want to get some sleep.
