I know that I probably shouldn't respond to my own posts, and I'll try not to do it from now on, but I have to respond to such a nice comment as yours,  urlLink Rachel . As I was looking over my newly created blog a moment ago, I just happened to glance at the comment counter of each post I had made, and, *ta-da!*, I saw a comment on  urlLink this post ! I thought to myself, "Oh, the horror! Someone saw my eye, and that person must not have approved! I know it!" But then, I clicked on the comment link, and there was yours, in all its glory. My heart thrust itself from my throat, which is where it had previously been, and settled back down into my chest, because not only did I get a comment within one day of having a blog, but it was a positive comment! As my peers like to say, "woot!" Rachel, thank you. Seriously, no one has ever said anything about my eyes. I guess it may be because I wear glasses, but you, ma'am, found beauty in the ugly duckling that is me, Matthew, and I will remember that.
