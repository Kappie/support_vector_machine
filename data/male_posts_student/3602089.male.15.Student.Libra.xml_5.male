We checked out a swiss clock shoppe and bought lots of neat stuff in the village that that was in.  The wood carvings all over the villiages are amaying...most houses are over 400 years old.  Surprisingly, in the hotel that we are staying at (in the villaige it is in) there is a musik festival going on that we have been to...very interesting but since we cannot drink beer, there is not much to do there but walk aound and look at the sidewalk shops and food stands.  The language barrier doesn't really create a problem...usually only machines.  Today we checked out lots of waterfalls as well, but I must go now...only 40 seconds left...yak
