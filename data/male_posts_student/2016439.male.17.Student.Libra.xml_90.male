We--my friends and I--made a splash, to say the least. You giggled your happy foam bubbles of joy and provided a Goldilocks environment for us (not-too-hot, not-too-cold...). I regret not having spent more time with you this summer, but you were sick for the better part of the first half. Now that you're better, perhaps we can be friends again like we used to be.My mother and I aregoing to Austin for a couple of days, so you and Dad will have the backyard to yourselves gain. Don't get too lonely. Maybe raindrops will come out and play.
