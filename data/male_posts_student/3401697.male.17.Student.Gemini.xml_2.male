Artic wolves in NYC, Swells as high as the Statue of Liberty, and KILLER ICE that can kill you in like 2 seconds.  overall a good movie that was a little over the top.  also, the south wwill rise again because we did not freeze haha.  well obviously i did not run today, but i did a lot of swimming, but that doesnt really count.  til the morrow.
