Dear _____, I am so sorry for what is going on in your life right now. Man, i wish there was something i could do that could give you rest and make you happy. I want so badly for you to find what you want, whatever it is. Give yourself a break..and remember you've done the best you can.  Always here if you need it, -neil   i have to be up in 4 hours for work, life rocks! HAHAHA! night.
