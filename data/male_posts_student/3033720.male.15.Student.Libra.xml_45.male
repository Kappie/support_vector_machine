Towards the end of the day, three big guys with beards came in. The first sat down, and I began talking to him. We spoke about AFS, because he was curious where the Russian girl that works with me was from. Then he told me the two people with him were foreign, one from Germany, one from Denmark. He also went on to tell me I'd be after his daughter, because she is 15 and foreign. He seemed to approve of that thought, and spoke with me more about his daughter. Then the two foreign men came and sat down. They asked where their coffee was, and I said I would go check for them. The German one started yelling, "No time! Meeting is now!!", while the other two told me to ignore him and go check on the coffee. So, I went and got their coffee and brought it to them. I then came back a moment later, and the German stuck his finger in the coffee, and splashed it on me and said, "dieser Kaffee ist, geben mir mein Geld zur√ºck, Sie schmutziger Jude kalt!" Which translates to: "this coffee is cold , give me my money back,you dirty Jew!" Anyways, I'd rather not go any further with that story, but I will say the manager got involved. And no....I don't think he said anything about Jews....But I found putting that appropriate. But he did speak in German....And he did yell...And shake his fist..And splash the coffee on me. From there I went up to the mountains with my dad, and we shared a beer...Or two.That's it for that day. For now, "Ich bin aus". Or, for you English folks, "I'm out".  By the way, I'd like to thank Aleisa for the translation. Good luck with AFS.
