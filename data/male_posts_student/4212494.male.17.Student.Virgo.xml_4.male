Wow, I said "official"....I feel all cool and professional now....          I'm on AIM right now, talking to some friends....my real thoughts lie in random areas, though, as usual...Today, my thoughts are: "That ugly girl with the big lips - Forgot her name - Is a happy-go-lucky teenager in the movie '13 Going on 30', but she's a stripper in 'Catch Me if You Can'. What the hell is up with that? Stripper-Gone-Teenage-Shopping-Freak?!"          Aaanyway, you've heard my random thought of the day. Now all there is to do is dance!! *break dances*          I might post a new entry tonight, maybe not. Depends how bored I get, and if there gets to be anything exciting to write about. I guess I'm done for now. OH!! But I'm gonna put up random funny quotes I've heard prior to typing entries, so, if you want a shout-out here, just say something worthy of Funny Quote of the Day, mmkay? ^^          Random Funny Quote of the Day (RFQD):      Me:  Why are we here? I think people are starting to think we're lovers or something...      Chris R.:  Oh, but we are! *growls sexy-like* I went to town in your pants last night...It was a great town...The mayor was really friendly....      Me:   Let me guess, the mayor was shaped like a penis?      Chris R.:   He was shaped like a popcorn kernal.      Me:  There's popcorn in my pants?! Good, I'm starving!!      Chris R.:  No, not popcorn! I'm saying you have hemroids!!      Me:  Oh....OOOHHH!!!
