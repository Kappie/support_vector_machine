Love is the life for me, Passion growing all for thee, I can't help but drink my way, Living life for a brand new day,  Reading, growing, I know whats new, Living for a brand new you, I have a dream for lifes new trail, Give me a boat to sail,  Sail away into my dreams, Living life for the new me, Living, Loving thats all I know, Soon I'll find a place to grow,  The passion that I'll know I'll find, Growing ripe upon the vine, This is my life I see Living for a brand new me.
