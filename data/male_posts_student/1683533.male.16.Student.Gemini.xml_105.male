Go to Vans.com,  urlLink bitch  and design your own custom slip-ons.  I did, and I ordered them, and they will be here in 3 to 5 weeks! :)  They are pink and black checkered. so hell yea to that.  Well, as I said before nothing has been happening in my...erm...musical career?  So I decided to go out and look for a band instead of trying to form one with friends.  I started putting flyers up and I grabbed a few numbers as well.  The first one didnt work out, but I called this guy in Jeremy from Bloomfeild Hills, and he is a drummer looking for a pop punk type band (listed on his flyer were: NOFX, The Descendents, Blink 182).  I had to ask marty if he was up to it, but he also asked if we were serious about this, and I said yea, and that I have been trying to get serious for the past couple years, but alot of previous band members were just too....well...I don't want to get mean...anyways...I said yea, and then he said he is currently leaving another band and he just needs to finish recording things for his producer (he is 15 I will add, so this kid is serious).  He said not this week but next week he will be able to practice.  So me, marty and jeremy are gonna practice next weekend, and hopefully we will have more luck than previous bands.  Mine and Kate's 3 month is in two days :) and congratulations to ben and megan to making it to the big one year :-O.  adios  "Chin up, Chin up, until it touches the moon, it's you i'm talking to" -Catch 22
