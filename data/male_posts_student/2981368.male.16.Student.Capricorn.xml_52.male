Guess who I talked to today...only the legendary Mr Webdood. Sodding asshole extraordinaire. I doubt I've ever had to type the words "shut the fuck up" so many times in my life. Bahjeeeeeeesus. But anyways, that kid is funny. Went totally ape-shit when I reminded him about the yr 3 SATs joke...bwahahaha.   I now wish to put a pub sign up on our street, with Ron's face and "The Pain in the Arse" on it. And I also gotta remember that phrase. Ape-shit. I like it and want to use it more in civil conversation.  In the other news:  -I get doubletime tomorrow *woohoo* -My sister is a good chef. Her chocolate cake is about 90% chocolate. Its so tasty its almost painful. And there wasn't any jam for filling, so she used...yes, melted chocolate. -Jan Hrdina is cool -History coursework sucks -Yorkshire Bank Plc are facist bastards -Theres a place called "Butthole Road" in England -"Wherever you will go" is cool -Some Finnish science people say eating chocolate helps the health of unborn babies -Easter is the tastiest day of the year -Only 1 more week of hols. Then back to school...then exams!!! Holy shit!!! -I should be doing coursework instead of this -Hell still hasn't frozen over. BUGGER.
