I've calmed down a little over the past couple of hours since I came to work, but not much.  Why am I so pissed? I found out how much they want to replace that little window: $430.  Yeah, that's right: $430. For a window about half a foot by two feet in size.  I don't know who it was who smashed my window. I don't know why the did it--probably just for a lark, or to be destructive and malicious. Frankly, I don't really care why they did it. What I care about is that because of their callousness, because of their disrespect for other people and other people's property, I now have to shell out nearly $500 to get a little fucking window replaced. The sheer absurdity of this--that I, as a victim of random vandalism, now have to pay for being a vicitim--pisses me off so much, I can hardly see straight. I've accomplished  nothing  today because of all this. I hold that nameless stranger responsible for all of this, and I hope that if he or she is caught,I get a chance to prosecute them. Because I damn well didn't have the money to pay for this right now, but I'm sure as hell not just going to leave a gaping hole in my window like that.  On top of all that, there's a chance of rain tonight and tomorrow. Reality's just trying to shit on my parade today, you know?  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "In a Future Age"
