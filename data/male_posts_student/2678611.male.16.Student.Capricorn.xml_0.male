You can make yourself believe anything. If you want to hate someone you can, if you want to love someone you can. It's actually a very simple concept, its how people fool lie detectors, all you have to do is believe the lie. So if you can believe a lie, then you can believe a feeling, maybe thats how people in the middle ages learned to love the spouse they were forced to marry, either that or they hated them and eventually murdered them in their sleep...one of the two.
