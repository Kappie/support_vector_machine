In the movie the head designer at a United States Robotics is found dead. All facts point to suicide, but Will Smith a homicide detective that has a bad background with robots is determined to blame a robot. Overall this movie is very well throughout and there is never a dull moment. There are parts of the movie that are very unrealistic, but most movies like that. I recommend going to see it, but if your like reading the book is much better.
