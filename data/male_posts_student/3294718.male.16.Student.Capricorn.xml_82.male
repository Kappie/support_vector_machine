Also, Houley and "AnalyzeThis" occaisionally post.   What I mean is that I dislike Kerry about as much as I do Bush. If he is elected, he will very probably run again in 2008, which would force me, therefore, to vote Republican just because John Kerry is a doosh. I also feel much of America would feel the same way, in that a large part of Kerry's support comes simply from antipathy to Bush.  I heard someone, maybe Bill Maher, say that large portions of Americans already have their minds made up as to who they will vote for. It will be a small swing amount in the middle that determines the winner of this race, and they will not be swayed until the bitter end. It's sad that elections are not fought on basic values like they should, but instead on political climate in a country.   I'm also at a lack of anything intellectually stimulating, but I decide not to rant and rave about it... until something comes up...
