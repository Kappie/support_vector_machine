Open invitation to anyone who wants to come in and see me craft a Strawberry Lemonade or Pepsi on the Rocks!  I haven't talked to anyone in a while, except Gerrit, who came in yesterday afternoon to say hi.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Gerrit- We will roll, soon! Luke- Sensei, Sifu, Master- I will be back on Saturday, my next day off Edgar - Yo quiero Taco Bell Joe - I have a Kiwi Drink with your name on it Al - Jack Daniels spells T-R-O-U-B-L-E.  And p.s., knowing a police officer doesn't mean your above the law. Adrian - Where are you little buddy? Ruben - Read any good magazines lately?  Anwyay....I hope to see you all soon  The Irish Bomber aka Applebee's Newest Drink Slinger, Danny
