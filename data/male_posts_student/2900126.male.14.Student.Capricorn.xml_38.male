Because I want her to be there to be one of the first people I see when I get back next week. I'm gunna miss her I swear I will, yeah she is a great person and an even better friend, I guess I'll see her when she comes back. But Sonya, LinZ, Erich, and I will always love you Chichi don't you forget that. So yeah Chichi tell your mom I said "hi" and remember if you want to you can send me a letter and I'll write back.  I'm gunna try to learn some Latin and put it in my letter to you. Well, Chichi if I don't get a chance to do this before you leave * hugs Chichi and kneels down and gives her a kiss on the hand* I love ya Chi and I always will your a great friend and a great person. If your family brings you down in any sort of way just write about it like in a notebook or draw something to get your mind off of them. Don't fret it will be ok, trust me it will. ^_^                      sincerely your pal,                                      Lonzi/lonzzi/lonzo/ and the infamous "turkeh"    I'm gunna miss you for those 5-6 weeks yer gone. I want to say alotmore but I knwow it must end so love ya
