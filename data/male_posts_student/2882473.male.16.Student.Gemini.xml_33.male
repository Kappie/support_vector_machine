Looked in 2 of them, NEITHER OF THEM HAD ANYTHING ON ESPERANTO! Chiz. So, it took a while to get to Charring Cross station to start with. Then, just as we were getting off the train, my dad spotted a mobile phone on the carraige floor. So, we picked it up and decided to hand it in to the lost property place. We spent about 10 minutes looking round for it, after some guard grunted and pointed vaguely into the station when we asked him about it. Looking round the station, it suddenly rang. Dad answered, and it turned out the owner had rung it. We reassured him it would be handed into lost property.   Next was a 20 minute walk towards the 2 bookshops I had planned to go in. Blackwells and Foyles. Spent about 30 minutes in them overall, looking for a book that wasn't there. Then a train to Canary Warf; my dad insisted I see the nice new shops there. Spent about 15 minutes looking round them. Took Docklands Light Railway back to Lewisham, then a long bus jorney into Bromley. And the whole way (about 30 mins) there were these REALLY ANNOYING boys sitting behind me, about 5, 6, and 7 years old. 5 of them in all, I think. With 2 adults, probably mums. They were talking really loudly, and saying things such as 'spell cat' 'ok then. C-A-T' and then, 'spell bus' 'ok, B-U-S' ARGH, it was SOOOOOO annoying. I hate children. Bah, Humbug! Anyway, then at Bromley South Station we waited about 15 minutes for a train to take us back to Beckenham Junction. So, after about 4 hours from leaving the house, we got back, having bought only some tran tickets. That was my whole morning.   Decided to do a bit more biology revision when I got back. Now that was dull, but better than sitting in front of those annoying kids on the bus. So, after a bit of revision, I watched tv. 'Diagnosis Murder', a crime series set in a hospital. It's actually not bad. Makes something to do. If you're interested, it's on every weekday on BBC1 at 14:35. I generally watch it every day I can.   Well, now I'm back to being bored again. May do a bit of revision, although watching a Star Wars video is much more appealing... I watched Episode 6 yesterday, so it only makes sense to watch Epidode 1 today. But that one wasn't all that good. In fact, it was pretty terrible. Damn little Anakin. I hated that little kid. Bah, Humbug! And that Speeder race was boring. And Jar Jar Binks was annoying. Maybe episode 2... slghtly better than Episode 1. Or 4 or 5 even. Or maybe something completely different. Like revision. But that's sooo boring. Ok, Episode 2 it is. Bye Bye all.   Playing:  Actually, I was playing 'Cool Borders 3' for the PlayStation yesterday. Rather dull.  Listening To:  Duel of the Fates  Watching:  Just watched 'Diagnosis Murder' Soon, Star Wars Episode 2  Annoyed With:  Small Anakin, those kids on the bus  Confused About:  The nervous system  Mood:  Slightly less bored than yestersday
