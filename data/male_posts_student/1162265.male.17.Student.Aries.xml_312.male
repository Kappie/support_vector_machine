But besides that, they're pretty similar.  Memory-  Another one about camp.  Sneaking out, is more or less a rite of passage at camp.  It's something the oldest seniors are almost expected to do.  I hear people do this at all boys camps, or all girls camps, but I think the meaning of it is lost then.  The whole reason we'd do it would be to get girls, usually not to do anything other then talk on our cabins porch (the Senior boys had a Cabin that was on a hill, so it's entrace had stairs leading up to it.  At the top of the stairs was 'The Porch' which younger kids weren't allowed on.).  I'd never done it before one night, but Adam (Coney Island, son) convinced me to come out one night.  Fun stuff, what can I say.  He first showed me the art of actually getting a girl to come out of her cabin, you'd do this complicated lookout thing as you quietly moved into the well lit girls unit (I swear they used halogen lights).  You'd carefully sneak into the cabin, tap who you wanted to wake up, hoping you remembered their bed right, hoping they didn't make any loud noises, and then quietly sneak out.  But regardless, Adam is showing me as he gets this one girl up, I think it was Aurellia, the Italian bombshell who somehow had a mom that lived in South Orange, and a dad that lived in Italy.  I could rave about how hot she was, because her image is forever etched in my mind, but that's beyond the point.  So Adam is like "Marcus, go get Fran."  So I try to play it off cool, but I was soo nervous.  I sneak into the cabin, people asleep all around me, I narrowly avoid knocking their fan over.  I look over at the counselor's bunk, she's asleep.  I tap Fran.  "Fran... Fran...Wanna sneak out?"  She mumbles something in a semi-groggy haze, but get's her shoes on and walks out.  Easy right?  We walk back to our cabin, since this wasn't a planned makeout night, I have a sad story about that *sobsob*.  So we go up to the porch, talking commences, around 3 or 4 AM we start to see what might be light in the sky, so we take the girls back to their cabin, and that was it.  I snuck out maybe two more times, but the year after that somehow it lost it's appeal.  I guess the adrenaline made it worth it.
