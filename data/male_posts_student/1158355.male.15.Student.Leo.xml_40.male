As you previously read with me and Chris, it has been our fighting game since WAY BACK IN THE DAY and now for the first time, Paul and I fought. We started off by closing our eyes and spinning a million times around, then someone called Fight! Of course I wasn't trying the whole time or else I would of gone crazy ass raged on Paul. I went easy... except for the end where my dad broke it up because we were creating an earthquake. We both took some good falls and at one point in the match, I actually thought Paul was the chair so i jumped on it and Paul being all stealth and silent, didn't say a word so I figured... WHEREVER PAUL IS HE DEFINETLY ISN'T UNDER ME! Paul threw me off the bed, I threw him into the bed corner and the Goo's Money Jug... I'm poor... it's got a few quarters, dimes and nickels... AND PENNIES! Ok so nobody won the competition because my Dad came in and broke it up but if there was an end, Thomas Joseph Cornelius Grimaldi would have defeated old Paul Lucipher Ludwig Mozzletoff Stoltz. Then we decided it would be great if there was a few girls in this game, that way we wouldn't have to worry about the awkward positions... and maybe bring along a few of our friends that we are superior of... I won't mention any names. We need weaker people to show off of course and make us look good. Ok, so after that, my family and I, Tiara (sister's friend) and Grandma all went to Milano Grill on Jeriko Turnpike. It was good, we had a great amount of laughs and I ate some hELLa good cheese cake. Then I came home, danced on my bed and went to bed. HAPPY BUFFDAY MOMMY!!!
