Me and Britt went to the Mall of Georgia on monday, yesterday I did nothing, and today, me and my mom went out to eat and then we went out to dinner for my dad's birthday at Macaroni Grill. Tomorrow will be busy. Registration at 8:30, then FINALLY I get my license at 10:30. I hate to admit that I'm almost 18 and don't have my license, so after tomorrow I am FREE. Then, tomorrow night, I am either going to see Blues Traveler for free at the Variety Playhouse with Britt or to see Bob Margolin at Blind Willie's with my dad. I'd rather see Margolin again because he is a badass. Oh well, that's all. Ron Isley is the biggest pimp ever.
