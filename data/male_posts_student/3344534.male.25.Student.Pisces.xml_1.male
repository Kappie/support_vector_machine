"But then, suddenly, Hull beats Hasek, the red light goes on, they rush the Cup out to mid-ice for a fast presentation and then everyone runs for the bus. Everyone except Kelley. He's looking at replays. There's a foot in the crease. This should not count. This is not right. Buffalo's getting cheated!" now that call was BS... and you KNOW it too bettman.
