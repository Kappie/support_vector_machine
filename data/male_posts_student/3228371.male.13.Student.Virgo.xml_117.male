Guess who? :) Nima of course! ^^ I've got like 4 pictures of him on the front of my door along with my celebrity mini-posters and behind the door are the 3 we took together at school. I put them BEHIND my door just in case my uncle came over and saw. Hehe! Now I can face the door every night when I go to bed so I can fall asleep staring at him.   My mom picked me up after school and drove me home along with Nima and his and Mark's instruments. Returned Mark's guitar and amp and then my mom dropped me off at home so that I can print out the good copies of our lyrics and everything and also record the song onto my computer from the tape so that we have a copy of it. While I did that, my mom picked up the photos from Wal-Mart. Then, we drove off to AM1430 Radio Station and I walked in to hand in the registration for the song-writing contest. The person called out Esther who was in charge of this and then she looked through the stuff and led me into a meeting room for the radio station. Told me to take a seat and I did so. She looked through them once more and asked me a few questions. Basically just making sure that I know the rules and what would happen if we DID make it to the Quest.  You know what's really cool? Pinky Luk is one of the "sun sow" people in the Chinese singing-contest thing! Oh my gosh! I heard her on the radio and I'm like: "Oh my gosh! I know her!" One of Wilfred's friends. She introduced herself on the radio and she said she was 16 and attended UHS. I'm so sure it's her! So yeah. I don't know her personally but I know her through Wilfred. I'm not sure but I think she came to Screemers with us? Iunno... blah whatever.   I've still got so much on my mind right now... geez, this sucks... I'm so afraid of high school. Nima and I have NO CLASSES together! So basically I won't get to see him except for at lunch everyday and well, to be honest and totally blunt, I know I won't get to see much of him at lunch anyway. He'll be hanging out with his friends and everything so basically, we'll be so seperated at high school! That sucks crap... Seriously. *sighzZ* Fucked up.  I hope we make the auditions for the contest... pray for us please.  Good news. Moca isn't quitting anymore.
