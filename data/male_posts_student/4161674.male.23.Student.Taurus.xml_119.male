It's by Virginia Hamilton Adair.  GAMES WITH GOD  I played, a child both wild and meek, with God at games of hide-and-seek. I searched in vain the usual places and found a thousand saddened faces.  "Your God is hidden in heaven," they said; "You'll see him only when you're dead." How could I make them understand God often took me by the hand? Then as my tears began to fall I felt his touch and heard his call, "I never hid from you at all."  I played with God a game of tag, his mantle flying like a flag. I gave my God a good head start but caught him running in my heart.   I played with God the game "I Spy," but lost him with my fading eye, till playmate God in his pure kindness, printed his image on my blindness.
