Instead, I waste tonight chatting and posting on Blogger ^^;; Oh well. I guess it's for the best. I certainly hope that there's no unpleasant surprises awaiting me over the next days, and everything runs smoothly. I just want to pass everything already. I kinda care about my marks, but I rather pass now. ^^;;    Another thing is that my computer is starting to get screwy. I'm asking Joe to help me fix it on Friday... It's starts lagging out of nowhere, crashing sometimes, "fatal exceptions of 0E", among other problems. @-@ and it's a new computer too..   For the summer, I plan to take swimming (lifeguarding).. but I found out that my instructor didn't mail me my cert for Bronze Cross yet... I need to look into that. I can't take NLS (lifeguarding course) without having the Bronze Cross cert, I don't think. Summer school seems to be ruled out.. While I'm sure that parents' will still provide me with ample work @-@ There's always the ever-present paper route (I was carrier of the month last month! Yay!), and I want to get back to reading, Yugioh tourneys, and the website. I wouldn't mind just hanging around with my friends (*sigh* i hope that happens often... it happened a total of like twice last summer), and I know I have to help Vics with his violin exam by being piano accompaniment.    I guess those are my plans for the summer... It should go by really quickly... unfortunately   ~Chronos
