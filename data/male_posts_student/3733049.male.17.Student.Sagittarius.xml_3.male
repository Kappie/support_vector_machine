After researching every site and taking a thorough ass-whupping from Dyanna, Brian and I decided to have a little fun.....and make up cereal with sexually suggestive slogans. This, for the most part, is when we started:  Brian[1:16 PM]:   A FAT LOAD IN EVER SCOOP!   Dyana[1:16 PM]:   whatsthat for?  Brian [1:16 PM]:   Boo Berry   Dyana [1:17 PM]:   what?  Dyana [1:17 PM]:  ooo ok gotcha  They go back and forth with real slogans for awhile until....   Brian [1:34 PM]:  OLLLLLDDDDD SKOOOOOOOL   Brian [1:34 PM]:   POP A CHERRY WITH EVERY LICK    Brian [1:34 PM]:   CHERRY FLAKES!   Dyana [1:34 PM]:   wow that was DEF on a site or something   i never herd   Brian [1:35 PM]:   UVE NEEVR HEARD OF CHERRY FLAKES!   Dyana [1:35 PM]:   noooo   Brian [1:35 PM]:   they were like frosted flakes but had little red cherries in em   Dyana [1:35 PM]:   eeewwww   Brian [1:35 PM]:   nah but they were like candy cherries    Brian [1:36 PM]:   they had a smiling cherry as the mascot    Brian [1:36 PM]:   and the kids always tried to pop him   Dyana [1:36 PM]:   u can prob read that right off the site   Brian [1:37 PM]:  good luck..it is soo old skool no one will have it   Brian [1:37 PM]:  I WIN!

Poor Dyanna. Pray for Brian's soul.
