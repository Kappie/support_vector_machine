Don't be too caring, I might like you. Don't be too sweet, I might fall for you. It's hard for me to love you when you won't love me after all...  Bottomline : A person who makes me loves him/her is actually a person who loves me more than I love him/her. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    then after this new yr eve (2003), we go out often n i thought of confessing to her one day cos i cant find a good time to confess to her. we knew each other for nearly 5 yrs (1yr++ on the net n 3yr++ after we met) and i was trying hard to keep this frenship to last and after these few yrs, i really wish tat we can be together. i don mind about her family and her (looks and attitude) cos 4 yrs, it's not short n it's not long, i really wish to be with her. i even continue to my finaly yr to get a degree to earn more to support her cos i know she spend alot. i also planned on wat i will be doing after i have finished my studies, eg buy a house, car for her, open a business and after tat we can spend the rest of our lives togehter.    it is stupid to some but at least i have a goal in my life which is to make her happy and taking care of her. i never told anyone about this though, i even thought of sacrificing my chances going to UK. i was called by one of the general manager of logica synergy (i m not sure cos i forgot)to send in a resume. if i can get the job, i will be working there and earn 2000pound/month(around 13k-14k here). nvm, forget it.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you think something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only once.  Bottomline : Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you back. Give it a try else you might regret later...no one other than yourself knows what can truly make you happy. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*    ok, back to the main topic. during the last chinese new yr, we went out on the 30th, 3rd, 4th and 5th. she find me everyday though but i was with my family and i tried to find some time to go out to accompany her cos she was alone. we even watched the last samurai (i never tot tat this will also be the last movie i will be watching with her). i was bz at tat time n i even lied to accompany her. although we didnt do anything but i was happy. i told my fren, and they asked me, why the hell u didnt try to hold her hand when u have so many chances? they wont understand, i respected her and i knew she will be scared if i do so and i will only hold her hand only if she accepted me. guess ppl will said tat i am a dumb guy. maybe i am......  continue........
