Takes about 3 hours before we go outside from the time she says "lets go out". But anyway, i didnt go with them cause i was arguing with her. Shes crazy. She really needs to see a psychiatrist.  Anyway, they came back when they were supposed to go food shopping and they didnt. She walks in with a Steve Madden bag... Now why is that not surprising. She comes up to me and im arguing with her and shit, she tells me to stop and then gets all aggravated like and putting me down by saying im a sicko and a lunatic. After that she tells me she got me a phone. Of course that was a lie. She got herself a phone and gave me her old one.  Then after another 30 minutes, she tells me we need to go get food and stuff. We leave the house, she wanted to go to a restaurant to eat but i told her that im not, because theres no way in hell that im going into a high class restaurant with my mother and brother. They will start a scene, and i cannot handle that embarassment. Thats the last thing i want. So she takes us to the supermarket. I stay in the car because shes just so fucking embarassing. She supposedly is a little hard of hearing and constantly yells saying "What?" like extremely loud and she did it 3 times in the parking lot, and i cant walk while shes starting that shit. So i stood in the car... And thats all.
