B corps is finally ramping up but I wish I was there everyday instead of so spread out through the week. Im actually doin pretty good in B corps now, i thought about the whole mind game thing and it is completly true. Also seeing A corps all the time makes me want to be better. And i will be.  Neways school is out and i got my report card its the best ive ever done, P Dig Med  A ROP Foren  A  P Us Lite  A P US Hist  A P Chamber  A+ P TA Gan   A I was happy it was the first time ive ever in my life got a 4.0 but yea i dont think there's anything else that is remotly interesting about me. Ill update more regularly.
