Here's another brand new fuckin' blog comin' at ya faster than...somethin' thats fast!  OK, well today's slogan (the thing up there that is followed by the phrase  "...its the Punk Rock Editorial!" ) came for the song  "Punk Rock Song"  by  Bad Religion .  Just givin' them the recognition they deserve, you know.  Anyway, lotsa things have been goin' on recently and everyone is fuckin' busy.  Whats the cause?  I'll tell ya in a second!   School!   Yeah, thats right, if you hadn't heard me bitchin' about it before, we've embarked on yet another journey, another quest to attain knowledge.  Sounds like an epic conquest!  Anyway, yeah school has started, and I'm still tryin' to get back into the cycle.  You know, stayin' up all night when I was on vacation really screwed up my internal clock thing...so I'm tryin' to fix it up.  School's been pretty good though and I've been havin' a lot of fun so far.  Heh, yeah from now on you are prolly gonna be hearin' me talk more about school because...school is now (once again) takin' up a large time slot on my time tables.  Yay!  Alright, somethin' I havta address.  As some of you know,  Nick  has about three blogs, which include:   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare , the  T.E.W. , and somethin' he calls  Rants .  Well last night, I was doin' my regular check up on all the blogs, seein' if there has been anythin' new posted or whatever.  Well, he did an article on  "teasing, heckling, and blah blah."   So he talked about how the  "cycle of teasing"  has to somehow be broken.  You know, read the article for the full story.  Sorry  Nick , but that is the biggest bullshit I've ever heard!  Breakin' the cycle of teasin' huh?  Thats sorta impossible.  Because the thing you refer to "the cycle" has always and will always exist.  There's no way you can disrupt the cycle because its there and its one of those things that doesn't need any verbal recognition to justify it's existence!  Everyone, yes everyone, gets fuckin' teased by someone else.  Yeah, even if some people get made fun of more than others, there really isn't anythin' you can do to stop that from happening.  Does anyone remember those tips they used to give us back in elementary school on how to handle situations with teasing?  How they told us to say "please stop" or to just walk away?  Yeah, well they were fuckin' idiots to say that because you would expect adults to remember how school was, how bein' young was, and how, if you used those bullcrap techniques to try and avoid a confrontation, you'd be worse off.  If anythin', those "techniques" for avoidin' a fight provoked more than they did pacify.  But teasin' doesn't stop in elementary school.  Remember junior high?  Everyone was fuckin' conscious of themselves because we were goin' through so many transitions at that time, it was hard not to get picked on.  And bein' a kid, I know how kids are...we're discriminatory idiots and it was either pick on or be picked on.  Its the same way in high school.  Yeah, we're sposta act "mature" or some bullshit like that because we're gettin' older and its expected of us.  First of all, who are they to fuckin' set standards for me and tell me that I havta live up those fucked little standards?  Anyway, even in high school people get teased.  And teasin' doesn't stop there.  Elementary, intermediate, and high school are just little models of what society really is.  Look at them.  Can't you see it?  Those stupid little "levels of society" may not have been apparent, but they're there.  In school, you've got the popular kids...jocks and cheerleaders...you know, the elite...Then you've got the middle class, where the majority of kids are...then there is the band dorks, nerds, geeks, and the smelly kids.  School is an impeccable little clone of what society is really like.  You may not know it, but yeah, people are classifyin' us into little castes right now.  Or maybe this is just my fucked up perception.  But here's what I think...teasin' and hazin' is just a fuckin' part of growin' up...its one of life's fucked up little lessons so you gotta accept it...you can't go through life without be made fun of who you are, cuz you know what?  We live in a fuckin' world where variety is both a good and bad thing.  Though our beliefs, opinions, ideas, gender, ethnicity, background, appearance...,basically the things that define who we are, seperate us from everyone else and makes us "individuals," the problem is that it seperates us from everyone else and makes us "individuals."  You can't expect people to coexist peacefully.  People are always goin' to discriminate...people are always gonna form stereotypes...accept it.  Not everyone is goin' to agree with you, and not everyone is goin' to tolerate you.  Right now, whoever might be readin' this is either noddin' their head vigorously in agreement, or is shakin' there head and brandishin' a fist at the computer screen.  Big deal to me.  I say,"Right on!" cuz that means they are fuckin' stickin' to their beliefs.  I'm not here to tell you whats right or wrong.  I'm just tellin' you what I think, not teliin' you what to think.  Anyway, people only make you feel inferior with your consent.  They are just one person outta who knows how many who dislike you.  As long as you know who you are, then fuck what they say.  RIght?  I mean, yeah, I've been to those points where its just like "I can't take it!" but hey, its like a shot or an enema...its over before you know it.  Their is some psychology behind hazin' as well.  Make them look stupid so that you look better.  Yeah, kinda like an ego boost.  Its stupid, but I admit that I still talk shit about people...cuz you know what?  Its fuckin' fun...and sorry, some people set themselves up to be made fun of (i.e. big mouth girl who is very fat and wears see through pants so we can see her fat asshole devour here poor little sky blue underwear!).  Anyway, I know my limits.  Its kinda weird how kids get teased and then they decide that the best retaliation is to shoot up the place.  If you seriously brood on bein' made fun of that much, then you've got a problem.  You care too much of what others think that you kinda forgot what you think.  You know what kind of person you are.  Don't let other people change the perception you have of yourself.  Only you have the right to do that.    That hasta be the fuckin' longest blog I have ever written.  Course, you can expect more of this right here on the  P.R.E.   I think I wanna continue on this topic...of school shootings and what not.  Strange how things branch off...and well I had been talkin'  Elyse  about this stuff last night.  Remember though..."Your point of view, it belongs to you/No one can take it away."  Sorry listenin' to  Pennywise's  new album,  From the Ashes !  Yeah, it comes out  Sept. 9th .  How am I listenin' to it you ask?  Bootleg connections, bee-otch!  Alright, I'll do another blog later.  Maybe it'll be longer?!  Who knows!  More to come...!
