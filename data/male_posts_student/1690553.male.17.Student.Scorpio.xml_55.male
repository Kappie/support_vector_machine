Don't know who did it but really, it caught my attention.  If you have read Malaysian papers this week, it seems that gangsterisme among students is on the rise. We are shocked by the death of two students in two weeks time - both incidents happened in the East Coast. OK, about the latest case which happened at my neighbour state - a Form 4 student was stabbed to death by a Form 5 Student. The weapon is not mentioned but apparently the attacker didn't run away and stay in the school compound until the police pick him up. Maybe only then he realized he had killed someone and regret it.  Then, the earlier case which happened in my very own state - my auntie also teaches at the school. This time a Form 4 student caused the death of a Form 5 student after a fight. The Form 5 student didn't die at once. He was admitted to Mentakab Hospital before transferred to Kuantan Hospital.   OK, here's some insider's information from Kuantan Hospital. That student at first said to his parents that his injury is not because of fighting, he said that he had tumbled down a stair. When he is admitted to Kuantan Hospital, he went through an ultrasound examination and CT Scan. Those scans revealed internal bleeding of his liver. He was operated later, only before he is pushed into the operation theatre he admitted to his parents that the injury is because of fighting.   Sadly, he died after the operation. There are no apparent bruises but the injury is serious. I'm told that the attacker learned "Silat Gayung" (Malay Martial Art) and maybe that had made his punches lethal. Silat was used by Malay warriors and soldiers during the olden times and it can be lethal. Well, does this means that Silat has to be banned for students? This a serious case of misuse of a treasured Malay heritage. I hope such cases wouldn't happen anymore, Al-Fatihah to those students. I wonder how the school management and Education Department would handle this?  PS:   urlLink  Utusan
