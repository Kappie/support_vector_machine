I spent the day at work working on some stories for my fiction blog which you'll have to ask me for the URL. They're a series of short stories titled  Stories You've All Heard Before . They're clichéd, overused stories that have been told millions of times-- events that probably really happened to some people-- maybe with their own little twists and quirks. True pulp fiction, in the litteral sense of the term, not in reference to the film. My fiction writing has a certain Cheese Factor to it, so I thought I'd go for the cliché stuff I've heard a million times and try to rework it (shit, it's made million$ for other authors). Right now I'm feeling that they'll all settle around a Hitchcockean theme of bad, unusual things happening to good, normal people, but who knows, I might write something different.... I've got outlines of two stories written and I'll get to writing the actual stories soon. in the mean time..... ghurhghrthhfhkehehhlflapghraaaarghhhhhmlllplop.  Oh! Tony Danza is getting a daytime talkshow! I can't wait... My nipples are hard just thinking about it!  NP: some Ani and some of the new Medeski, Martin, and Wood album
