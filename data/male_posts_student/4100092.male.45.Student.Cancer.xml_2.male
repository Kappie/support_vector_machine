It implies that it is somehow detrimental to us if we hear wrong.  That leads to the conclusion that there is also a contrasting benefit if we hear then hear the right way.  This seems odd, mainly because it shouldn't matter at all how I hear anything.  I should hear it, get the chance to think about it.  If I like it I take it in, if not I reject it.  The responsibility You should watch what you say. It doesn't seem fair that I would be effected by something that you said?  To be effected because you said something out of context, or I inadvertently misunderstood what you intended.  However I have experienced it.  It is why I may shut a conversation down, or walk away from someone.  I bring it up because some of you have not learned that dynamic, you need to becareful how you hear things as well as what you say.  I see you ever day in the congregation of the 2000's, Starbucks arguing about what ever you philosophy might be.  You seem "hell bent" to convince me of what ever illusion may be suffering from, you can't let it go.  I know that as I write this most of you are imaging some born-again Christian on a soap box, but I am not intending it at all.  I have to hear from the Kerry"ites, the Bush"ites.  The Genome, black hole, political what ever.  What ever happened to "hi".   I just want a cup of coffee.  I think that we all like to be victims a little.  We are good at throwing stones but not as good at looking in mirrors.  People are not very nice to Christian's or others of strong convictions.  I witnessed a guy who was following this poor guy out to his car.  It seemed all the guy wanted was to wish the other a nice day, he said the most offensive words a man could hear, "God Bless You".  I would propose that part of the problem of having to argue is driven out of an out of balance defense mechanism.  I think that is connected to what I will call a spirit of offense.  It means I just have to fight about something.  This is the reason I am suggesting that we need to be careful what we hear, how we hear.  I don't need to be offended at what you said.  I don't have to slay every dragon.  I don't have to champion every cause.  My mom used to tell me becareful when arguing with stupid people, people watching may not be able to tell the difference.  I can live in peace.  I believe we can live at peace with God, live at peace with others and live with peace with ourselves.  Victor Manning
