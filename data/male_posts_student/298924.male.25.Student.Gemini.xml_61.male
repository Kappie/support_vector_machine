So I'm eating breakfast with six of my favorite ladies in the class and the homie Geoff....well Geoff leaves me alone with the ladies....and my immediate thought is, "Oh Joy!"....I should have been thinking, "Oh boy!"....Next thing I know three of them have gone to the car and they come back with gifts....yes I had the horror of being the lone male in a gushy female gift-exchange process....I thought I was going to die of embarrassment....it was AWFUL....  I'm still shaking off the effects as we speak....  The moral of this story is (in the continuing theme) NICE GUYS FINISH DEAD LAST (and endure undying humilation every step of the way)....
