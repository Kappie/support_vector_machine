I have my art project to do but the wackos in here wont stop bugging me! I can't draw when I am aggravated. Its different when you typing, you can stop and then come back to it and it looks the same. If I try to draw, I will probably mess up and that would make me mad!   The nose is feeling good today.   I was thinking more about making a new website but I would like to research the idea I have more before I put any of my money into it. I think it would work. Other web sites have similar services/info, but not they way I want to display it and have people respond to it if they want to. The web page would take a lot of planning, then a lot of time to maintain, but really think it could work. At least I know for sure it had a good possibly of becoming popular.  The computer room is empty now. I am bored. My only friends are the sound of 20 computers humming along with no one to operate them. Sad.....yes.....true...yep.
