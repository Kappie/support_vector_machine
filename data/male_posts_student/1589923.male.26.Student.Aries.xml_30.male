It is very well written and i can totally relate to this person....anyway here it is....  "not too long ago, XXX and me had this issue between us - our past loves. we all have them, our histories, our pasts, people whom we've fallen in love with, given a piece of our heart away to. but then where is the line drawn?   for me, rather sadly, i don't keep in contact with most of the people i've loved. somehow, it never worked out very nicely in the end. conveniently for me, i guess, i don't commuincate with them. surely there is a place in my heart for the few i've truly loved, well namely two, a  b, but things are different now.  XXX on the other hand, still communicates with the people he's loved before me, and still loves. they will always occupy a special place in his heart. (i believe if you've truly loved someone, you never stop loving the person till the day you die. you might love less, but you never stop). i used to get jealous and uppity about it, especially the times when so and so's name would be mentioned oh so often, and he would speak of them in glowing terms, almost like someone who has a crush. these things riled me up. he would say over and over again, "but you've got me now. i love you. i don't see why you should get jealous over the fact that i still email and chat with them, or want to meet up with them when they're back". what didn't help as well was the fact that the previous guys whom he fancied and never got, which resulted in me thinking i was the consolation prize in the past..., and that he still liked them cos he never got them.  it's been about slightly less than a month since we've had another one of those conversations. i can fairly say that the issue's over. while yes, there sometimes is the nagging fear that my bf will cheat on me, or that his heart might stray from me, it isn't any different than any other person would have. ie. the size of that fear now is normal. and sure, once in a while i worry, when he starts talking about so and so, doing this and that...  but you know wat.. it takes two.  on his side, he's put everything into action, and not once given me doubt about his love for me. his actions, as thus far, have proved more comforting and assuring than all the words he could ever say. he's always been a person who doesn't believe in words that much, it's the actions that speak loudest, he says.  on my part, i've had to realise that it's different for him. unlike me, he still keeps in contact with the people he loves. and while they will occupy a teeny spot in his heart forever, i've got the bulk of it. and i've got nothing to fear.  faith and trust. two words that hold up a relationship.   and they can't be spoken."
