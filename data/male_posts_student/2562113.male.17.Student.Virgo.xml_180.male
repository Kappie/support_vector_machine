And there's this burning, Like there's always been, I've never been so alone, And I've never been so alive, I go home to the coast. It starts to rain, I paddle out, On the water Alone, Taste the salt and taste the pain. I'm not thinking of you again, Summer dies and swells rise, The sun goes down in my eyes, See this rolling wave, Darkly coming to take me, Home, And I never been so alone, And I've never been so alive.
