Carissa and I talked for awhile, and she told me that i should go for what my gut says. So I am. I really would appreciate it if you guys wouldnt like be on top of me and asking me why i didnt go out, because im a horrible wreck right now. You all know how hard it is for me to make decisions. Oh and i dunno if the cedar point thing is gonna work out, becuase Bill and Micah come back the 19th, so they wouldnt be able to give us a deal. I dunno what you guys wanna do though. Just call me or something, because i need friends right now. lol. Love, Rach
