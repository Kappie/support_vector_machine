People would rather give up then fight for what they want.  I will never reveal my loves name but I want her back more then almost anything. But even this isn't a thing to get her back to tell you the truth I don't want her to read this.  It is open to everyone else but she is the reason I started this.  I need to get her out of my head that is why after I write anything on this blog I will never read it again.  She said that she loved me but that it is over now.  How can it be over and I am still feeling this way.  I am constantly distracted by thoughts of how to win her back, each one more desperate then the last.  I've wanted to be completely honest with her but I have never realy been, I have kept every promise that I could without reveling my past and told truths whenever possable other then when it would give her an idea of who I used to be.  I don't know if I have ever forgiven myself for the sins I commited when younger, but my bigest fear was that she wouldn't.  When I gave up my last life I swore that I would never reveal it to anybody and so far I have kept to that promise.  I have told alot of stuff but not all of it.  Nothing that would comprimise anybody else.  Now I wish I had.  I hate every half truth and lie I told her.  I remember every one and I can't seem to forgive myself.  I keep on thinking "maybe if I told her everything would be different".  She says she hates herself.  I can't help but to blame myself.  The thing I want the very most in life is for her to be happy.  When we got back together for the last few days she said that she thought that she would be happy with me.  I don't know if I believed that.  I hurt her because my past came back and bit me in the ass.  I still haven't told her the real reason.  And I don't know if I should.  Tell one lie to keep another, I don't know what I should do.  Right about now I'm ready to do somthing but I don't know what.
