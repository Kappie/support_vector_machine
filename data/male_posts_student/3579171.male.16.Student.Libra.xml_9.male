In Blogspot's case they seem to have changed to something much more... sucky.  There are a few advantages to the new system, but the pitfalls greatly out-weigh the advantages.  Let me give you some examples: When you push the button for "new post" it takes you to the screen where you format posts.  New post and format post are not the same damn it!  You can't even type anything when your formating the post.  When you push the buttons to make font bold or italic it doesn't even make the font bold or italic.  It just deletes your entire post!  And, there's no way to recover it.  Stupid Blogspot, why do I even bother with this?  Even though there are pitfalls and disadvantages there are still some advantages.  For example, theres a new button that allows you to put in block quotes.  The good side is that it's pretty nifty.  The bad side, it's almost impossible to figure out how it works and when you push the button it deletes your entire post.  Hmm... Ok, that's not much of an advantage but it's an improvement... kind of...  Any way, I want to try the block qoute thingie so... here goes:  What we've learned from this horrible tragedy is that the male model's life is a precious, precious commodity.  Just because we have chiseled abs and stunning good looks, does not mean we, too, cannot die in freak gasoline fight accidents. -Ben Stiller,  Zoolander    Wow it actually works.  Don't ask about the quote selection, it was all Kolina's idea.  It has nothing to do with anything that can be related to anything.  Any way, I can't think of anything else so I'm just going to stop now.  - Some loser   "Live as if you were to die tomorrow." -Mahatma Gandhi
