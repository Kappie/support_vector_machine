I kind of miss the ability to read previous posts so that you could respond to things in them. That was cool. Damn. I just realized that I screwed up the Corndog link. I'm going to fix that now. I had something I wanted to say, but I totally forget what it was now.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
