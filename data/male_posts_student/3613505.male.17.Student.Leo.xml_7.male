But if there's one thing I do know, it's that our planet is under attack from all sides, and sadly, it's an easy thing to miss. I for one aim to assist in the opening of the collective eyes of America, and perhaps the world. And that, you see, is the purpose of this column. News that matters, brought to you through the unflinching eyes of a polar bear who likes other polar bears that are the same sex as he is.   ITEM - So it looks like California has asked president Bush to provide it the same protection from offshore oil spills he has afforded Florida in recent times. Well, you'll pardon me if I'm a little skeptical, but to me, this whole thing stinks of stunt on the part of our little White House squatter. Perhaps he thinks that a few offshore leases here and there will make the country forget what a ruinously bad environmental track record the man has. Mister Bush, here is one homosexual Ursus maritimus who will never forget the oil bigwigs who've got your presidency in their back pocket.  ITEM - James Slattery of Minnesota has been fined $1,800US after his reckless snowmobile driving took the life of 20 Canadian geese and 14 mallards. I'm sure some will think this is an exorbitant fee to pay for simply killing some of our precious wildlife, but I for one applaud the decision. Hats off to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, whose investigation led to the swift delivery of justice. Incidentally, my hat goes perfectly with my outfit.  ITEM - The Environmental Protection Agency has released findings which show that simple exposure to air pollution presents a cancer risk as much as ten times greater than any deemed acceptable by Federal law. Well, perhaps now all those big companies will be forced to own up to the damage they have been constantly and recklessly inflicting on our precious natural resources and to the human race itself. "These findings are a wake up call that EPA should take action to reduce this long overlooked public health threat," says Emily Figdor, the clean air advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Well put, Emily. By the way, if Emily were male and ideally a polar bear, I might perhaps want to engage in sexual intercourse with her. But since she isn't, I don't.  ITEM - I will be in the Vancouver area the weekend of June 22 to give a speech at the Clearbrook Library sponsored by University of Phoenix Vancouver. The topic of the speech will be "Endangered Species: Are We Doing Enough?" Doors are at 6:30 and the presentation starts at 7, followed by a question-and-answer session. It's my hope that we'll all benefit from an open dialogue between like-minded individuals. After the Q, I will probably go cruising for a few twinks who are into boots. Hoping to organize a piss party; contact me through the usual routes if you know anybody or if you yourself might be interested in getting crazy with a room full of piss-soaked faggots, at least one of whom (me) will be a polar bear. Boots a plus. I am HIV-, you be too. We're hoping to avoid another of those bullshit parties where there are way more tops than bottoms; please plan accordingly (this is not to say that there won't be a little pig-in-the-middle planned, however).  ITEM - The state of North Carolina has come under fire - and in fact legal action - from the states of Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, and the Southeast Compact Commission for Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management for its opposition to a planned radioactive waste dump which would be placed in its own borders. The lawsuit is over an agreement North Carolina made in the past which the other states feel it is failing to honor. Well, if you ask me, the only thing North Carolina is guilty of is failing to mollycoddle these NIMBY-crying losers. IF they want a place to dump pollutants, then perhaps they should look into their own land - or perhaps they realize what a bad idea this dump would be and don't want to shoulder the responsibility for it. They ought to be ashamed, and I hope the courts see it the same way.  ITEM - In case you had somehow forgotten, I am a polar bear, indigenous to the Arctic, that prefers the romantic and sexual company of males (and I myself am male). I also prefer penises in my anus and mouth and hands and in one very bizarre yet still satisfactory encounter, armpit. It occurs to me that I should probably go back and point out in the previous item that North Carolina is a lovely state with a pleasant atmosphere, friendly people, and an absolutely stunning gloryhole scene. Oh well.  ITEM - And finally, closing out the column with a little good news: According to the World Wildlife Fund, three of the top ten whale-watching spots in the world are located in none other than the United States of America. Just goes to show that while we still have a long way to go, the environmentally-conscious are indeed making a difference! Well done to all involved in the conservation effort. If we keep it up, the world will indeed hear our voice. Inspiring stuff. And for now, reader, I leave you with that thought. And remember: Think globally, act locally. God bless.   NOLAN CONRAD is an internationally-known voice for environmental concerns. His column, "Environment News," appears in over a thousand papers nationwide. Mr. Conrad currently lives in Alaska and is totally into boots and gulping down gallons of hot steamy golden piss.
