While nothing was revealed, it suggests the US could be expecting a problem in future oil supply.  Personally, it got me thinking of the post-election strategy of Syria, Iran or even Saudi Arabia....  In the wake of that story comes this story.  John al-Kerry is predictably calling for Bush to begin releasing oil reserves to combat the 'high cost of gas'.  There's so much wrong with this I don't know where to begin.  -Why is the President responsible for gas prices? -What part of STRATEGIC RESERVE isn't understood? -Gee, maybe we should build refineries? -Or how about drilling some of our own oil? -Or how about reducing the number of gas blends from 28 to 1?  But the American people will probably want these reserves released so they can save $2 a tank.  It's so easy to be a Leftist when all you have to do is appeal to emotion.
