Yup...Me, Heather, Katherine, and Robert's rendition of Romeo and Juliet: Act 3 Scene 1 (the rumble). Wow I never thought we could be so......dumb? lol. But it was a pretty good play......one of the more memorable ones I guess haha. Today actually wasn't too bad....well I enjoyed the day at least =P. Got sleep last night, and everything ^_^. So today was actually a pretty....well...."energetic" day?  Like I said I slept early last night (11pm....WHOO 7 hours of sleep OWNS!) and managed to wake up on time for once (6:20am or so). It's Friday so band....yup Senior band again hehe. Actually got there on time today though....hahahaha wasn't late =P. Today....hmm.......well I'm not used to 5-page long music in band yet......so I kinda accidentally skipped a whole page of music in Godzilla Eats Las Vegas. They were @ bar 40 and I was on 139....whoops >_>.......  Music class.......whoo playing test today. Eeew I did so bad. Well "chinese-failed" at least.....also a Joe-Chan-Music-Fail. 90%?! Yeah I know it's high but normally I can whoop those things to 100. Grrr.....oh well least I'm passing =P. Then we split up into our little groups for the ensemble things. The brass group I'm in actually sounds pretty good now.....lol Mr. Clark burned the saxes today also which was pretty funny....  Frederick: *hears saxophones* hey....I think I've heard that tune before....sounds famliar....it's actually good too. Mr. Clark: The first sound yes....the last one they made is probably a sound we never want to hear again.  Then there were woodwinds too....don't know what happened with them. Mrs. Wharton was conducting them. Oh yeah and the song Son of a Gambolier.......WOW does it sound good now lol.  Science....we did a lab today where we ran around da school with those trundle wheel thigns measuring out hallways. 3rd Floor reeked of something REALLY gruesome.....and I couldn't breathe going down biology hallway (pig dissections I think?) Both ways.....*shudder.* But lab was kinda fun. Mr. Curphey made Rhoden go last though....wonder why *cough*. And Pourier got another detention for throwing paper lol.  Lunch......went to Galleria. HAD CHINESE FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD! Haven't had that for lunch in AGES. Fresh fried rice.....yeah it  still appeals to me =). It was pretty good stuff......I might consider going there more often ^_^.  Bio class today........Wow...........................one of the most funniest classes ever. Ms. Wiener I think had a bit too much caffein flowing through her system....but it was funny what happened today lol. Just so much random stuff *can't really describe* but it was funny. Unfortunately I got dissed by Drew today. When she called him Joe by accident his reply: "How dare you insult me like that." Ow. That's all I could say lol. It was a funny class though......then she started ringing the bellringer bell.........and sang Okanski Happy Birthday lmao. Oh yeah.....and also when we started talking about old children TV programming......LOL. She actually KNEW Transformers theme LMAO THAT was classic hahahaha. Then Okanski:  "Man.......Power Rangers was so cool! I mean at first I was like 'whoa the red ranger kicks ass' but then the White Ranger came along.........MAN WHITE RANGER WAS WHERE IT WAS AT!"  Yeah my bio class can be pretty unforgettable at times. Oh yeah....now I know why stomach acid doesn't burn through your esophagus when you vomit...mucus protects your epithelium! But what about the sink?=P. Why's it stay alive hehe.  Oh yes........english class today.......soooo unforgettable hahahaha. The plays today were hilarious. Lol.....the best one I can remember other than mine was probably the one by Kelsey, Anne, Holly and the fourth person....forgot who whoops =P. Anne's imitation crying lol wow it was funny. Then again.....I think our play whooped some SERIOUS ancient Shakespearean ass =P. Lol first off though we had wrong 007 theme for our opening.........WOW JAMES BOND TECHNO W/ OUR PLAY LOL. Me and Robert jump onto scene with techno music playing in background...then I speak in Jackie Chan accent "MY PALM PILOT SHOW CAPULET COMING! LET US HIDE!" Yeah the whole class.....was cracking up through the whole thing. Mrs. Gayed couldn't hold in her laughs either.......Robert's Teddy routine......wow it got her cracking up for sure. Oh yeah.......and then for the fight scene the music we got was uhh........P.Diddy's "Come w/ Me?" LOL it was good though.....the whole fight scene was hilarious....and then the intermission music lol.....me and Robert draw the "bodies" of Tybalt and Mercutio. Oh boy good times good times hahahaha. This play's gonna be stuck in my head forever. Oh yeah then the Chinese Take-Out remark I made....kinda made fun of Chinese food but I had to say it. See there was this one line about sadness....and one part was "instead of a wedding feast, we are now going to be mourning at the dinner table" and I said somethin' like "instead of a wedding feast.....we stuck with Chinese Take-Out again." Yeah I realize what I said.....but it was pretty funny at the moment. Oh yeah and English test: 90% BeeHATCH! =) YEEEHEEEHEEHEEHEE!  After the wild english class, bused home w/ Ryan. Then went home. Tonight no UCC, no nothing. SC ALL NIGHT LOL. Yeah I know no life but who cares lol I'm dead tired today. So SCed, piano, dinner, SC, piano, theory, and now.......SC then SLEEP! =P.  Later.
