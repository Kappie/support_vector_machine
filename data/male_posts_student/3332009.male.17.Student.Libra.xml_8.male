If Arsenal,draw or win their last game at home. They will be creating history. I know it might sound irritating to some but Arsenal are truly amazing. In my eyes,they are the best. No matter what, I will always support them. Today was freaking boring day. I stayed at home and rot.  Nothing interesting happen. Life is so boring when your sis is not in Singapore. Why did she have to go to Australia? I just read the newspaper and watched some movies i rented. There is alot of strange things happening in the world.By the way the weather is so bloody hot. The weather is so funny that it keep on changing. One week it rains non-stop, the next week it is so hot. It is making me sick.Trust me guys, in the next few days it will rain.
