Which I got a C+ on but thats besides the fact because I got an 97 in the class. But then I found out I got an A in English. That made my day, only like 5 people get A's in her class. And I was one biotch! After school I had to clean out my lockers and then I got yelled at for talking on my cell phone on the side walk. I was like "hey! if they can give condoms out on the side walk, I can talk on my stupid cell phone." Well he wasn't to happy so I stepped onto the road. Then my mom came and I went home and got online and was bored. And very hungry. So me and Kyle decided to go somewhere. We decided to ride to Nancy's over near Krogers. So we took the back bike path which is really cool. But there was this freaky guy who like wanted to rape us. Luckily we weren't raped. We ate and then went to Kmart, Krogers, and finally the great Walmart. Then we road around and then went backed to Kyle's house where I almost beat Kyle in pool. But then I rode home and just got back online for a little. Then I went and picked Kayla up and we went to Codi's and Brie's going away party. Which was interesting... The cops came which is always fun. Andrew and Brian are leaving for South Carolina tomorrow. So yeah, like the next week is going to suck and be borning. But I'll find ways to occupy myself. Oh! If you want to see a cool converstation and how cool some people are, look at the comments on the post before this. I just don't see why if someone hates you, they don't leave you alone. It makes no sense to me. But I guess it doesn't have to. I just stay away from them, but they come to me. I just must be that cool. Tom Green is on Jay Leno. He is a great man. Later!
