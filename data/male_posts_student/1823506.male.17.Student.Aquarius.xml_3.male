A few rules:   Remember that anything here is a dream, and I have no control of my dreams Know that I will only record exactly what I can remember of my dreams, these logs may be broken and confusing, but I won't make up any filler, and I won't leave anything I can remember out. All comments I have on the dreams will be put in italics to set them apart from the dream log itself. I can only record a dream immediately after I wake up. If I'm not near a computer when I dream, I can post later only if I wrote the dream down. This way time won't dull the dream or alter it in any way.    That said, as you can see this site is not really ready yet. I plan to make major formatting changes later on. Bear with me.
