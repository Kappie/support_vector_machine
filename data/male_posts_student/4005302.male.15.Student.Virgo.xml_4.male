Fencing camp was great. Hanging out, listening to Logan's weird as hell stories, even falling down the mountain during the hike was cool (yes I definitely jumped over 3 and a half feet in the air!). I've confirmed that my girlfriend is very attractive and smart and cool, so that was good. . . Yeah, camp was the greatest--definitely the highlight of my summer.  So when I get back my parents buy me a laptop for my birthday. I was like where did this idea come from! Not that I'm arguing or anything, it'll be really snazzy to have. Well, I must sleep, work starts again tomarrow. . . grrrrrrrrr. . . Oh well, I need the money, I guess.
