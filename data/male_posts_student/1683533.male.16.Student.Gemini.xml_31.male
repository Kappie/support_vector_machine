FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I wanna record so bad, I wanna be heard....dammit....I don't even think Ben cares, I ask him if he wants to practice or record or something and he always says, "I dunno..." I don't think he ever knows what he is doing a certain day until that day comes...which doesnt help me at all...  "That producers with computers fix all my shitty tracks" Ben Folds
