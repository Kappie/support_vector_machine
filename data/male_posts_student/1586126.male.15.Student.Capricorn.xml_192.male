You say you don't want to become an animal killer, but I bet you eat and wear child-made products and you don't give a fuck. I'm sure you don't think about it when you buy your tasty Milky Way with processed chocolate in a poor African country, or when you buy your Quicksilver shirts or your Nike shoes, I can understand that because you also have to be worried about what people say about you in school. Let me tell you something Tilio told me: ""School" is just a fraction of your life" and that is true, unless you are going to die at the age of 20 and you know it, then you are really fucked up.  I hate those "persons" who call them self humans and claim to be charitative, while they spend 50 cents for every $5 invested in their mascots, to charity. That is hypocrisy not compassion. Showing off their $100 shoes and their father's brand new Porche Carrera GT. I think that's the worst combination in a human being: hypocrisy and superficiality. If you want to be hated for the rest of your life, this is the key for your success, either this or killing the pope and twenty babies, but that is sick and difficult. Today the average human has became blind, shallow, and ignorant. Just like Felipe or Susi (Felipe's alter-ego) put it: Who the fuck cares about you having sex with a bitch! Good for you, but you may end up with herpes or aids or even a child, so now, does that worth it? Now, everyone cares about what's good for him. If you are combulsing in the middle of the street they see you as an animal with nothing to lose and probably most people think you are crazy. Only few are the ones that stop and help you, few are the ones that really care about you and the million persons around them. Those few are the ones that difference us from ants, they don't walk in one direction and fuck everyone who is on their way. They stop and talk to you and gives a meaning to what does being a Human is. If you enter a store nobody cares of saying "Good Morning" or "Thanks", everyone's is thinking "Dude, that's cool, I want it and nobody is going to take it away from me, even if don't buy it ever. Yes! I am a soul-less consumist, BUY! BUY! BUY! MC DONALD'S, QUICKSILVER, CELL PHONES, MORE!!!." Today it is like if you are   the only human left in the world and everyone else is just inferior.  Consumism is another thing is making everyone look like an ant. I say an ant because ants keep walking without caring about the other ants, they only fulfill their mission and nothing else. They don't talk they only work. The only difference between ants and humans is that ants are more consent with what they do and how they do it. We harass with the environment killing the animals and lately killing our selves. The good thing is that at least we are trying to improve and to correct our mistakes, but still not all the countries do that, for example U.S., Kyoto, does it tickles something? If it does then fuck you for doing nothing!!! Continuing with the subject... consumism is what is making us all the same. Disney is the ultimate consumist empire. There you can pay for a hotel and you can buy food, toys, shirts, toys, play in the theme park, and buy toys! You pretty much can to everything there, and since everything is Disney's monopoly in there you just consume. You may be asking your self... What about it? And that is exactly my point. Nobody cares. They just accept it, like if its normal, and certainly it is normal. Everyday we read advertisements, watch advertisements, and some people are even human advertisements. That is not bad at all, what is bad is to buy things that we don't need. Things that are just unusable is what is stupid. You could invest with that money in other things, either for needed people or just throw it at the bank. Other thing that comes along with this problem is than people feel insecure about them selves because they don't fit with the stereotype companies show to the consumers in the advertisements. Many fat people end up having problems for using products and pills that promise you you will lose all the fat in your body, and the ironic thing is that after those advertisements finish Mc Donald's, Taco Bell, Subway, KFC, commercials come in. What the fuck! Corporations are using us and the only thing that can help us decide what we want or what we need is us.  End    PD.: I don't know how I started talking about vegans and finished talking about self determination.
