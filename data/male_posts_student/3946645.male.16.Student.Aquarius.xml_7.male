Also, doing stupid things like tables for layout, putting main content in iframes, pop-ups (come on, who doesn't hate pop ups?!?!?!).  I was doing a practice paper for my CIW exam. One of the questions was:  "What block-level element will affect an entire paragraph and it can be an empty tag?"  The choices were:    BLOCKQUOTE  HEAD   BR  P   I guess HEAD doesn't count, as that doesn't appear on the screen when viewed with the browser, so it can't be that. BR is not a block level elemt, it's a text level element, so it's definetly not that.    That leaves us with blockquoteand p. I decided to go for p, as this puzzled me. How can a tag be an empty tag AND a container tag  at the same time !  Well, pwas the right answer and I know why. In HTML 4.01 transitional, you don't have to close the ptag, the browsers these days forgive you! But it's bad coding practice and a profesional company like CIW ( urlLink http://www.ciwcertified.com ) and teaching you this! That bloody outrageous! No wonder there are so many sites out there that don't work, or have crappy designs. People need to learn some web standards!!  OI, CIW, if you are reading this, visit  urlLink http://www.w3.org  and  learn something!   Chris... [/rant]  Don't worry, I'll be fine... Feel free to talk to me on MSN if I'm not busy.... :)
