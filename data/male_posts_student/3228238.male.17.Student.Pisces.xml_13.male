"Mother Church rejoices," were the first words spoken by Pope John XXIII, at St. Peter's Basilica, on October 11, 1962, the opening day of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council.  "Come, Creator Spirit," sang out two and a half thousand bishops.  This was a council unlike any other in history.  It had been 92 years since Vatican I and no one was expecting another such meeting.  Pope John was recently elected as Holy Pontiff and felt compelled by the Holy Spirit to call a council, though many were opposed to this.  When at last he was certain this was the prompting of the Holy Spirit, he initiated a council that changed and brought renewal to the Church in the modern world, without losing any part of Her very essence (doctrine). 	   Vatican II was the first council that was created, without the intention of stating doctrines condemning heresy.  This was a pastoral council, as Pope John felt that what the modern world needed was not condemnation for errors, but rather mercy and love.  As the world changed, the people changed.  Therefore, it is illogical to think that the Church would not also change with it.  The Church is One Body, One Ship, with people aiming for the same destination.  The key is to keep the same Truths, but to present them in a new way.  Over 1900 years, the Church had stayed traditional in its teaching and proclamation of the Gospel.  Pope John, inspired by the Spirit, saw that the modern world needed a new and vital way for the people to understand and better participate. 	 On example of change, was the lightening up of the structure of Liturgy, explained in the first conciliar document, Sacrosanctum Concilium.  Over the past 1900 years, minor things were tacked on to the Mass, which really were more ornamental than a necessary element.  Some examples are highly ornate garments, the pipe organ, and certain readings/prayers (all of which we could take out and still not detract from the dignity of the Mass).  The Church is the Bride of Christ and therefore the Holy Mother of us, her children.  Therefore, Mother Church desires that all of humanity be united in Her.  The Church, which is the Body of Christ, is a vine, and we the people are the branches, as Jesus said.  The Church spreads its branches over the whole earth, embracing every human with the grace to know and love God (the ability to reach heaven).  Vatican II wanted work harder towards this unity.  All people, as children of God should be united in peace.  There must be unity between all Catholics, because the Body is made up of "connected" parts.  It is the Church's strong desire that all Christian and non-Christian religions be united to the One, True, Catholic Church, which Jesus established on earth to last throughout eternity.  One vital fact we must remember is that everything Vatican II hoped to accomplish could not be consummated immediately.  It takes time; perhaps until the end of time.  This is seen most clearly with the strife for unity.  Many millions of souls converted because of the effects of Vatican II.  However, many left the Church because of ignorance or disagreement.  There are many people, especially of the older generations who donÂt understand exactly what Vatican II did.  They saw changes happening, which they blamed the Council on without even reading the conciliar documents for themselves.    An example of a major change was the Mass of the Traditional Latin Rite.  The Ordo Missae was the first book of the reformed liturgy.  This was a more simplified liturgy, which people could more easily participate in, with the changes addressed in the Sacrosanctum Concilium.  The language of the Mass was could be changed to that of the region, instead of Latin, based on the bishop's discretion.  These adjustments did not at all detract from the heart of the Mass, but helped more people to understand and participate in the Holy Sacrifice.   The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council did so much to help the world.  This paper can only show a glimpse of the copious fruits that came from the Holy Spirit through Vatican II.  This council lasted for four sessions, ending on December 8, 1965.  Pope John XXIII had died of cancer shortly after the first session, but Pope Paul VI finished what was started with the grace of the Holy Spirit as his Guide.   An English historian named Eamon Duffy called the Council of Vatican II, "the most revolutionary Christian event since the Reformation."  This truly was the consequence of the bravery and perseverance of two great popes, and above all a loving God.  At last the children of the Church could open a window and let in some fresh air.                        "Gaudet Mater Ecclesia!"
