WHAT THE *TOOT* *TOOT* *TOOT*! I never gotten such a low grade for Combined Science! And I am getting this at Prelims. Mid-year getting this, fine, not so bad! BUT THIS IS THE PRELIMS! Now, how am I supposed to got to the Chemistry course, you tell me? JCs (biasness! how could the education system! lousy!) absolutely despise Combined Science students! I can never stand a chance against Pure Science students if I only get a B3. My whole life is ruined. THERE GOES JC! And it's all my fault. I am angry at myself. For not studying Physics fully. For thinking that with Chem, I can ace Combined Science. Obviously, this is not the case. For being complacent. For being such a worthless *toot* (Actually, I shouldn't be degrading myself. But I want to get everything off my chest, okay?). Right now, I should focus on building up my Physics skills. And I brought a Science TYS too. You know, I am tempted to scold the teachers responsible for placing me in Combined Science (I can fare better in Pure Chem). But one of them may be Mrs Chua or any of my favourite teachers....so I shan't say anything. But all I know is that I am gonna work hard for the grades I DESERVE to have. Not this lousy worthless B3. A2 is so little. I DESERVE an A1! A1!!!! You hear me? A1!  Another bad news: I got 25/50 for my EL paper 2. Sigh. I shan't talk about it much. I just want to make a note that Miss Mala is totally contradicting Mrs Thong. Mrs Thong taught us that "explain fully" question is a inferential question. So, almost all of us Band 1 inferred. And was marked wrong by Mala. Not to say her leh, but Mala should consult with Mrs Thong! After all, Mrs Thong set this paper. And Miss Mala scolded us Band 1. Hello! She have no rights to tell us (no no...not tell. SCREAMED!) not to be complacent. How would she know we are being complacent?! Only Mrs Thong, who know us well, can tell us that! Well, we cannot say Mala is biased, because she screamed at her class also. But we felt so wrongfully accursed. Me, XC, Siva and probably lots more. Anti-Mala feelings are high in Band 1. What a *toot* (no offense to my band 3 friends. But I need to get this off my chest. And this is my personal thinking. I have my rights to think what I want to think, and not to like some teacher because you do. So, don't you ever start condemning me for what I said).  Al;right. Moving on from bad news. I got two pieces of good news to share. And they brighten up me day. :D. First stop. I got an A2 for Bio! YaY! I maintained my standard (or what Mrs Chua said...remained staus quo). Hmm! I believe I can get a distinction for Bio too.  The second piece of good news! I got....45/50 for SS! WOO-HOO! I am so proud of myself! Never in my life...have I reached so high! I am so proud of my work! My structured-essays! My source-based! Ahh! I love my work! That means, I already passed Ciombined Humanities (hello...so easy to get 5 marks). The matter now is to get A1 or not. To get A1, I need a minimum of 30. My usual standard for Histopry is around 37 and above. And Hist is almost similar to SS. If I can get 45 for SS, I am sure to get A1 for History. Well, not really sure. Let's see how things turn out, okay? Cannot be too complacent (this word makes me think of some  person  here!) ar.  Alright. I went home at 3.30. Took a bath. Went down to buy assessment books. Then, I played FFIX. FFIX Update: I leveled my characters roughly to about 2-3 levels. Fighting Grand Dragons all the time is boring. Yep! Meow meow!   At 7, Holland V started. 2 years have passed. The starting 'movie' changed. I saw XiaoXin coming back, and XX and JJ got intimate. Such a plot twist! I saw TianYang and RouRou being more intimate too. Maybe they will get together? Who knows? One of the most noticeable changes is that LingLing matured and became more refined. I like that change, actually. Being the head of the family (replacing WanWan, who is coming back 3 months later) actually matured her. That's very good. Yang Xiong became closer to the Mo family. Good thing also. I can't wait for more surprises!   Okay...then watched Comedy Nite...and came online. Tomorrow's gonna be exciting, for I am anticipating my History results. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
