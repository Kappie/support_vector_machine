We went to possibly the nicest Chinese restaurant in Manchester, the food was excellent and service was great, all in all a good time was had by everyone.    when I arrived home I was supposed to be going out with some friends, but they had all made alternative arrangements. This has annoyed me immensely. "Calm down" I hear you say, "you'll see them tomorrow or another day". And I totally agree with you, I really shouldn't be upset. But that's the thing about being housebound, very occasionally I really really want to go out with my friends and also feel physically able, which is quite rare.....    Oh Fuck This    I am just feeling sorry for myself and being extremely selfish. Sorry about that (who exactly am I apologising to?) I think I just go somewhere quiet and grow up a little bit.  :: Hangs head in self-indulgent shame ::
