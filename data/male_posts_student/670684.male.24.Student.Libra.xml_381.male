It's deserving of its own website, but until there's enough to put there, please indulge my sickness.         I don't know the name, but it's the $5 million bridge that opened last year, just east of Lamar, and it holds quite a substantial amount of foot traffic.  Why start there rather than Zilker, or Congress, or Riverside?  As Homer Simpson would say in reference to the star wipe, "Why have hamburger when you can eat filet mignon?"  And proof I was there (as well as proof that I'm narcissistic with my new toy)       My eyes are blue.  And the watery bits in there are because I'm staring right at the sun.    Rick Astley got added to the playlist tonight while I was eaten by mosquitos at Mozart's, writing a new Friendster profile and doing a few pages of work on the screenplay (better character introductions for Dawson and Marci)...work that should be a lot further along than it is.  Whatever.  Rick's good times.   There ain't no mistakin', it's true love we're makin' ...filthy genius!  Although the mention of lovemaking in this song made me blush in the fourth grade during a talent show where a Stephanie Tanner look-alike danced to it.  Stephanie Tanner was played by Jodie Sweeten, who I sat next to on a train in Disneyland once.  My dad wanted me to kiss her.  Had she been Kimmy Gibler...
