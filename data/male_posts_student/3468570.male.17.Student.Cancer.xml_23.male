But we couldn't prove that according to scientific method I guess, perhaps in the artistic mind I suppose? It can also tell us that life is really short...with perhaps a quick test of life on earth?  I was wonderin' the other day on why do other people write such minuscule blog entries? It seems rather stupid to me that most would write such blogs of puny and pathetic content. If you have nothing to write, then don't write at all! That is one of my main motto in my constitution, which definitely restricts personal freedom and permits the powerful result as a strict regulated student.  But looks like I've left out the 1A07 Gossip Club. I suppose the strict regulations of the constitution should have nothing to do with it lest it would cause me to lose one of my most favourite pastimes. Besides, the world can never go round without gossip. In a nutshell, humans need gossip to alleviate any boredom that awaits them. Even people back in the stone age were gossiping on which caveman to marry as well. And speaking of cavemen, there are quite a number of them at Yishun where they buy a big chicken drumstic and start using their teeth to gnaw at it. It is so uncivilised to have such actions done for it destroys the mere meaning of civilisation. We are humans, not animals!  Okok...looks like my bitchiness level was getting too high. Whenever you feel bitchy, you'll always feel like bitching around, and when you bitch around, you tend to get lame and corny as well that you will not produce corn but instead develop corns on your feet. Hmmm...shouldn't be too 'xiaxue' already!  Hikaru Utada's songs are so nice to hear, especially Can You Keep A Secret  Traveling. (Yes, it's spelt this way. Even her English is not perfect and no Japanese has bothered to correct her 'cause their English is worser than her American-born one and that anything English is very high-class in Japan whereas we Singaporeans think that it kinda' sux 'cause we've been learning since we were small toddlers!) But, I'd prefer to hear her songs 'cause they are so nice and she writes her own songs as well! =)  Thinking about Singlish, I wonder how do foreigners learn it? It must be difficult to learn it if you're not a native of Singapore or if you have not stayed in Singapore before. Like for example, when do you know how to use  lah  or when do you know how to use  lor ? It is really difficult for the foreigner to communicate in Singlish. Who knows? It could be a National Language of Singapore someday when the Singaporean society has integrated so much that we discard our four original languages.  Okok....I guess too much is too much. I have to retire to the night now.  A very wonderful night!
