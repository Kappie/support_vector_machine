Last night, one of the guys on the other team came up to our captain and said, "Hey Ragu, I think that's game." And Ragu (our captain) said, "Okay". Good story, I know. But I think we played well for our first time out there. I touched the disc once and was a few steps short of catching one in the end zone. And then there was beer and pizza afterward, which heals all wounds. And Donkey Kong. The place went had a Donkey Kong machine, as well as a Pac-Man one and one of those hockey games with the big glass dome where you move your guys around on little tracks using poles. I love that game. I was Canada, and I beat USA 2-0. And this was with my center dislodged from his track and lying in the other team's goal the entire time. Take that, USA!!
