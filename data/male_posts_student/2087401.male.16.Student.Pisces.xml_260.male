That's what Mrs. Mohr is for.  Ok, What's next.  Tommy needs to post. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.  Note to everyone. I don't know, I forgot. I probably won't post for a while out of respect for the others in this blog. I'm on hiatus. The lid is on, have a great holiday. Read my daily updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been.   What's Next?
