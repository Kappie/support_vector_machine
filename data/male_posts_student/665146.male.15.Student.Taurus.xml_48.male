She was a big smoker; even when I was little I remembered her smoking.  The cigarettes led to cancer (as they always do) and hospitalization.  She stopped smoking, but she didn’t get that much better.  She came to stay at our house for a while before going to a nursing home.  She eventually came back and has stayed ever since.  Her condition wavered.  If I missed anything, my parents will probably correct me.  Expect a change in this post.    Right now: She can't walk.  She hasn’t been eating or drinking anything for a while.  When she does, it makes her throw up.  She's just been sleeping.  My aunt (a doctor) came over to look at her.  The verdict was that she wouldn’t have very long.  Now she's in the hospital to find out what we could do.  Chances are, she'll need 24 hour help and won’t be able to get out of bed.  She is going to die here.  It's what she want, it's what my parents want, and it's what I want.  I never noticed how barren this house is.
