It is a big deal for me to leave my family for the entire day.  The time away must be productive.  I’m not sure it was.  It was a re-hashing of things we had covered before.  I suppose I’m just being impatient.  The time for action is near and I want to close the door on some of these projects we’ve been working on.  Perhaps I’m just getting a little arrogant, thinking I can go it alone.  I’m sure we’re all feeling a little tired of the talking and just want to get done to it.  When my wife got home tonight my daughter was in the funniest mood.  She was dancing and hugging.  It is so great to see her this way.  She had been sick for the past week and we upset most of the time.  My wife was smiling too.  I guess at the end of the day it’s all good.
