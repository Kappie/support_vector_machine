I really don't have the energy to debate it all, plus you have made some strong points that I can't refute (the actions of the majority of people, how society discerns you, etc).  In point 2, by "we" I mean people as a whole. The "I" part was meant as an example. I probably shouldn't have used myself as an example of the majority of the people. I'll concede that you are right in your points about seeking acceptance.  So, we differ on how we are defined: through society and through ourselves. Let's say that we are defined two ways: our "true" selves, what is inside us and how we see ourselves; and how society judges us. As one changes, so does the other. I agree that how society sees us can affect our "true" selves, and vice versa. That is a good compromise of our ideas and probably the closest thing to the truth anyway.  Anyway, to kind of take Houley's points and run off on a tangent:  Why can't we be judged as individuals rather than as social cliques? Do people see our group of  friends as another clique or a group of individuals? It is hard to tag a name on us since we are all so different. It is probably more friendship than common interests that hold us together. I try not to judge people as groups, but it is hard. You can't always see every person as an individual. Everyone has their prejudices, be it against psuedopunks or emo kids or gays or liberals or whatever. Sometimes I want to shout that I am a human being, dammit, and you have no right to judge me by association. But I think that most people feel comforted when they fit inside a niche in society. The  truly  messed up ones are the people that don't fit anywhere. But they aren't messed up, are they? They just don't belong. I guess every kid feels disconnected from society at one point, and I think that is normal. I dont hold grandiose ideas that I am a big rebel or anything, I just believe what I believe. I'm not sure how much farther we can dissect punk and society so maybe we should just let it be unless someone else wants to comment on it.   When I said "brainwash," I was just exaggerating because I was mad. I know conservativism is just as valid as liberalism. I was just shocked that these supposedly mature kids would do that to my car. However, parents pass on to their children the bad as well as the good. I don't think that parents are the architects of who we are. I was raised in a conservative religious family, especially on my mom's side. She used to force me to go to church even though I told her I didn't want to go. She never allowed me to grow because she tried to override my ideas with hers. I became extremely resentful then and perhaps irreplacebly damaged my relationship with her. Simply put, we don't agree. My parents didn't teach me right and wrong. I decided what was right and wrong to me. So my parents  (one of the most rock-solid and sturdy social groups with which any person interacts throughout their life)  perhaps think that I am a failure in their eyes. Well, my mom failed me by teaching me that her truth was the absolute truth. It is not (and neither is mine). I don't know if this brings us back to the punk argument or what.   Never let your parents learn that they don't have as much influence on you as they think.  In the majority of cases, parents are a good influence on their kids. In some cases, parents damage their kids lives by trying to make them carbon copies of themselves. (Some juniors would be an example, by picking up their parents prejudices) Another example are the Goat kids. They are exactly like their dad and live to please him. They will pick up his bad attributes as well as his good, and never grow as people.  On God: I don't know, man. No one is changing anyone's mind about God here. Let me just reiterate that I believe in free will. To me, God is the feeling you get from doing right, the reward of a life justly lived. There are different degrees of just to different people. To me, God isn't a literal thing as much as an idea.  "What about free will? Do we have a choice?" -Brett Gurewitz  A bunch of people seemed to congregate at the Hobster's house today, and we played some Halo, a fun variation of football with a volleyball, and me and Bryce went swimming. It was kind of cold but it refreshed me. Tomorrow we are going to Harry Potter and practicing for Goat Fest in the afternoon at Casa de Olshanski.   Having enough of my own problems, I'm not really qualified to examine your life, Hawkeye. But I will, because I like to meddle. You seem to suffer from a lot of teen angst. Just remember that things get better. Get out of your house more and stop brooding on it. Have some fun. Everyone gets a case of the emos once in a while, but you'll get over it. Creepy poem though.  Some general things:  One of the best parts of my day is when I wake up in the morning and remember that it is  summer . At the rate of fun that I am having now, this should be one of the most fun summers ever.  We should bring more people in the blog as Jefe seems to have died and Hobe is too busy with his whirlwind social schedule to post here. Does anyone have any suggestions for who? Some diversity would be nice. I had half a mind to ask Chris Derby but I think that he wants to do his own thing. But a John/Chris deathmatch would be cool.  Could the Casualties write a song so bad that not even they could rock out to it?  I'll have to avoid the Oseland's house for a couple days because Gail has visitors who are a bunch of jerks. It will be weird to not go there for a few days.  It is both cool and depressing not seeing everyone every day. I wouldn't say that I miss school though.  Hobe, are you going to any grad parties? I was supposed to go to a few but I don't want to go by myself. I was also supposed to go to Jamie's party but I don't want to risk running into Proctor and having to talk to him.  I think I'm done for tonight.
