".                                                        We all live in a Chaotic world. We miss appointments , have our fears , have all kinds of complexes (Superior / inferior) , Do some mundane work , try to enjoy life superficially .....the list goes on .... And as the title goes we are all trying to find a structure amidst chaos ...
