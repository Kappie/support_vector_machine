Then we called Jonny (who my father informed us had called me back) and he showed up.  It was a pretty good movie, though not very thrilling and without any revelation at the end, both qualities posessed by "Signs," which makes me want to see "The Village" (also by M. Night Shyamalan).  Afterward, we went to Bertucci's, where my mother showed up unexpectedly and so Loren finally got to ride in the best car ever, the Toyota Matrix.   urlLink     Loren got "My Life," because he knew Bill Clinton was my favorite president.  I've only read the first chapter, but so far it's very readable and interesting.  Time clamed it was a long ramble; I'll see.  I don't know if I should post Tanzania pictures.  There are hundreds of them, so I would have to pick the best five or something.  Hmmm...  Rockport thing next week, maybe Saturday.  Loren, Jonny, and Craig: you're all invited.  If anyone wants to see "The Village" or "Spider-man 2" or "I, Robot" or "The Door in the Floor" otherwise, let me know.
