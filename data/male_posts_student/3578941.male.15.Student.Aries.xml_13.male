I am putting a few quotes from the funeral in my uncles memory.   My cousin Katie, uncle's daughter, got up and said this, "I know two things, my father is in heaven and...I am daddy's little girl" I just like this quote. This one is from one of my uncles friend, he was helping him messure cut and put up siding, he asked him which side of the tape messure he wanted to use, the Alabama side or the Georgia side? Later he said that the Gerogia side had little numbers on it and the Alabama side just had a hook on one side.      How many people does it take to put up a nativity set? 19 presbyterians and 1 lutheren.       Ronald Edward Godbey
