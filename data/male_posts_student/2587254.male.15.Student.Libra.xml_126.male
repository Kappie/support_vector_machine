So today wasn't horrible....but it had its downsides. For example....the whole lack of sleep thing, lots of work...and my DDR file went corrupt. Me, being the lazy one just shut the PS2 off while it was saving, so yeah I gotta start all over again *grumble grumble.* OH well.....least it's only DDR...takes like an hour to beat =P.  Well today started off at 7:40, getting ready for church and heading out the door by 8:15 or so. Grabbed JT, and then Grace and then we were off to church. Jason got a ride from Carmen and Lina would get a lift from Vince. I was still trying to shake off my morning slumber, as the ride to church was pretty tiring. Things picked up though when my dad started talking about the Saturn SUV, and before I knew it me and him were debating over why dent-resistant cars are good/retarded. Yeah I know pretty random...sad part is he says next car he's thinkin' about that SUV. Then again he'll probably change his mind again...at one point was Jetta TDI, then Protege 5, Mazda6, Mazda Tribute, Ford Excursion...the list goes on and on...so by now I'm not worried what he says about the next car.  We finally arrived at church at around 830....and got right down to business. Ran through the songs real quickly with Gavin, who got there before us and then before we knew it, 9:15 was near. We almost had some problems with the laptop....BUT I FIXED IT! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Service today...hmm I broke my blister during the sermon....which was kinda gross so I rushed downstairs to grab a band aid...and also to avoid projectile vomiting if anyone else saw it. The sermon today was about "Pouring out your spirit." What I thought the message was this morning was that in order to fully believe in God....you have to fully let him take control of his spirit. The respone song I felt today was really suitable, being the song "Sanctuary" which goes like this:   Lord prepare me To be a sanctuary Pure and Holy Tried and True With Thanksgiving I'll be a living Sanctuary for You   There are a few more verses, but that one's my favourite. I like it mostly because it's telling God to prepare the sanctuary for you....not yourself, since this is something that only a power like Christ can handle. Plus....I also have enough burdens right now with school....so it's nice to know also that God's always there beside me preparing me with my spiritual walk, and also the other things on the way I request help for. I also liked today's memory verse:   "In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams."      -Acts 2:17   It's also pretty cool having the assurance to back up my thought of Christ always with me with this verse. It's cool to see how in the last days....which literally means as the end times near, God will be with all of us, every step of the way. It's pretty cool to know how there's someone always there for you....even if you're in times of trouble and no one else is there, except Christ. So yeah....for once I didn't zone out totally at the sermon....and actually enjoyed today's sermon =).  Heading downstairs after the service....BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP LOAF! I dived on that, ate a lot of it, but was still hungry. So then...to burn some fat *fat? Joe? HUH?* Carmen taught CiCi hot to tickle me....which then got me on a running marathon from a 7 year old trying not to be tickled, as yes I am a wee bit ticklish. So then after that run, I then chased Gavin down for a gummy bear, where I emerged victorious with a red sour one =). Afterwards though....yes I was still hungry, and Gavin was also...  That was when we then stumbled on 12 boxes of Cup Noodles *aka bui mein.* So we took a case and started making two cups, when then the whole HYPE group plus JT, and Kendrick and the people that were with Kendrick wanted one too. So by the time we were done eating, we downed 3 cases of Bui Mein lol. Mmm......Monosodium Glyceride....or w/e MSG stands for...always forget the G...  Class....was basically an extension of Sermon. Yup...except afterwards while reading Jason's GMR magazine....Lina and Josh kept throwing a Tic Tac box at me...which then led me to throwing my duffel bag at Lina and punching Josh. Yup.....that's most of it. I learned a new chord on guitar though! =) Plus I know how to play a F chord now....just not well.  So then getting home. Took Lina and Jason home first, and then got home to see a whole lunch of Take-Out Dim Sum already out. Mom had gone to Dragon Court to pick some up....so...the next 30 minutes consist of eating, eating, and more eating. Mmm.......food......  Played the piano a bit, then trombone, then piano again, then played DDR. This was when my file would be lost....as I shut the PS2 while it was saving causing a corrupt file to emerge. Oh well....yeah like I said not exactly an insanely hard game to beat. So after wasting time like that.....and having some productive time with the music practice....I headed to my piano lessons, since yesterday they got rescheduled to today.  Piano lesson: I need to work on scales/technique more....and got a new piece =).  Then for the rest of the night....hmm some SC, and LOTS of homework. Gotta start on history, english monologue, study for bio, math, and music still. I got a London Youth Symphony audition on Thursday....and I hope I make it. Hehe it'd be awesome if I ended up being a tromboner in LYS. Shaunvir's tryin' out also, and Arjun's going for trumpet. Meh....least I can still sleep. I'm still boggled by how Jenn manages to sleep so little and not get sick...and still manage to go to school. If I get less than 5 hours of sleep, I don't go to school. Period. Yeah London's pretty slow moving though. Just lookin' at people like Rebecca, Gavin, and even myself....we all seem to be pretty lazy people lol. Oh well anyways...getting off topic there...  Yeah I gotta go finish up some work. Heh first average blog in a while hope you enjoyed it =)...  Cya.
