Can't blame anyone else, except of this stupid group work that I done all of the work mostly by myself. Grades for that went downhill cause of the lack of knowlage of what's going on in the project by the rest of the members. Aiya... Let bygone be bygones.. Hehee...

And I'm go to work later on thanks to tara's daddy and of cause her . If not I won't even have a job. She wasn't there the last time I work, so I've got no idea how the commission ceremony works. Heheee... I'll see it tomorrow after I get my pay. Should I go thinking about the amount to be giving now? Nah~ Gotta think happy and work, if not I won't even get paid. kiraku signing out..................
