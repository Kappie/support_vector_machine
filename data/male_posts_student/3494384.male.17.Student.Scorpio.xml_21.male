I've decided. I don't wish to care about what people think about me anymore. I'm going to do what I like. No one is stopping me. I don't like my class. Argh... I'm sick of my class. IISO project, I'm alone? Even Victor put me aeroplane. What a 'friend'. Now I'm really alone le. With those pesky indians. Fuck you all. Black like charcoal, stupid like amoeba, uglier than Medusa, smelly like shit. If really I cant join Cecily's group, I will not join the indians's. I rather do it alone. Without you people stealing my credit. It will be tough, but I'll feel happier.   Enough about these.   Im meeting you on Saturday le... You finally replied my SMS. If I didnt told you I'm sick, I guess I would be still waiting and waiting and waiting... East Coast for us. I cant wake. :)   I guess I'm going to sleep soon. Plans for now? Packed my bag, clear my room, then go to sleep. Need to wake up early tomorrow. What time should I reach school? 9 am. It's so boring.   Plans for tomorrow? Print and bind and complete my proposal. It will be a breeze. I hope. Might talk with Jasmine and Cecily more. They are so friendly. Cannot be too shy le. It might fuck people up at times. Didn't call Kor back. What the fuck am I doing? School is making me sick. I need to study. Argh...   P.S   Remove my links already. Done a bit of clearing up on my blog.   Night.
