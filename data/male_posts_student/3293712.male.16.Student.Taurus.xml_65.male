Digital Camera Fund: $120  I've picked my four songs for the blog mix. Well, I've narrowed it down to five. I'd rather wait and see what everyone else picks so my songs fit better within the context of the mix.  Folded some origami today. It takes me forever to do one thing, while Bryce can pump out a million swans and flowers in a few minutes. Bryce picks up on things faster than anyone I know; you only need to show him something once and after a while he can do it better than you.  Really, I've nothing to talk about tonight. I can't even do reactions to other posts because Houley didn't post today, and Jeff is boring.  And now for  urlLink something completely unrelated .  Today I bought the latest  Rolling Stone . In case you didn't know,  RS  has great non-music related articles in it. It is suprisingly leftist, though.  In  Spin  the other day I read something interesting (What a surprise!). It was about why kids listen to rap instead of rock these days. Rap, unlike rock, still glamourizes the lifestyle. In rock, it is all about getting clean, helping the world, being a good role model for the kids, etc. In rap, it is still about the money, the twenties, the forties, and the sixties. I bet that is why glam rock bands like the Darkness and Velvet Revolver are experiencing such a surge in popularity. Come on, the Darkness is a  horrible  band. I've never really enjoyed comtemporary rock and roll, with its simple lyrics, cliche band members, and lack of originality. And the  guitar solos . Jesus Christ, the guitar solos. Who wants to hear a 3 minute masturbatory solo by a guy who looks like all the blood vessels in his face are broken? I guess if you are some kind of air guitar  virtuoso  who wears a Van Halen T-Shirt every day, that is cool and musically interesting.   I've always found Led Zeppelin funny. You can't deny their talent. They  were  rock and roll. Drug fueled excess, jailbait, and John Bonham playing a drum solo with his  hands  on "Moby Dick." But I bet even during the mid-70's, at the height of their popularity, you could tell that the members of Zep would be bloated carcicatures of their former selves within a few years. In the 70's, before punk came around in the last few years, rock was  dying , and the bands tried to squeeze every last drop out of it before it flopped over, exhausted from the excesses of the sixties and seventies.  Still, I'd like to have a look at  How the West was Won  and  The Song Remains the Same .  I'm going to cut it short tonight. I'll blog a longer blog tomorrow.
