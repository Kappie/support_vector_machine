At least for 4 years or so, GameSpot has been delivering reviews, previews, and all sorts of other stuff for videogames, and has always been right on top of everything happening in the videogame industry.  But, does that make them good?  Absolutely not.  The content on GameSpot is absolutely horrendous.  One example: the other day, I was reading their review of Spiderman 2, and they only gave it a 7.2.  Some suggest that the site is biased, or, at least, some of the editors and staff members are.  Others suggest that they just pretend to like games, and only give the good ratings to the big name franchises like Grand Theft Auto.    The design on GameSpot.com is actually really good, but, sometimes doesn't load correctly.  This is because it is such a heavy load of graphics, that it just doesn't look good.  Sometimes certain images will load, and sometimes others will.  It's just a matter of luck whether or not you're going to get the whole thing.   urlLink    GameSpot features a nice design, but it doesn't load right sometimes. This is the rare occasion when it does load right, however. urlLink     And, like I said above, the content is absolutely horrendous, and sometimes, you can't read it unless you pay something like $20 a year or something for their GameSpot Complete service.  IGN has this also, but, theirs seems to be a little more lenient.    After really browsing through the site a little bit, I feel disappointed in my review of 1up.com yesterday...I feel like I should have given it a higher score (check later on for that, I'm going to re-review it).  I absolutely hate GameSpot.  They give the crappiest reviews to good games like Spiderman 2, and then praise the Grand Theft Auto series to high heaven...which really isn't that good.  The one editor who does this should be fired in my opinion.  If they want this site to do any better, then they would fire that guy and others who have written some really smelly reviews.  Aside from the design being nice, and the cheat code database being pretty decent, GameSpot is a horrible site, and doesn't even deserve your attention.  So, I suggest either IGN or 1up.com.     Pros  +Sleek design +Nice cheats and demos and things   Cons  -Design doesn't load right sometimes -Content is horrible -Horrible staff members -Horrible Message boards -Not worth $20 for GameSpot Complete   Score  Content: 50%-F Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 55%-F Navigation: 65%-D Final:  65%-D    Up Next: Download of the Day- Avant Browser
