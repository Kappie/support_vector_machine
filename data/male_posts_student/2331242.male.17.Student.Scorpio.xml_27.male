Now she knows that I have not 15 notecards due, as I told her over the phone, but rather 30. She also knows that I blew off the overnight write. Bastard. I mean for Christ's sake, I was pleased with that paper! It did everything an overnight write was supposed to do! It answered the question and backed it up with a ton of facts. Then I get the thing back and it's marked up like the man was in a severe hangover with  the stupidest  comments. Example:  ME: The church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is an interesting one. Mr. A:(underlining the said sentence) ???????  I'M ABOUT TO EXPLAIN YOU FUCKTARD!!!!!!!  And at the end of the paper, my favorite part.  Mr. A: JD, emergency! Please see me! JD: Uh.... no.  Now I admit I hold a good portion of the blame for all of this. I really don't think the guy likes me. He never laughs at my jokes. I mean, the first praise he gave me all year was on the exam. The man singled me out infront of the class to congradulate me on a excellent job. I laid the smackdown on the multiple choice, only missing 7 out of like 60. Tied for best in the grade. My DBQ's were both 8/9. And what does he give me for a final grade? A-. A FUCKING MINUS. Brian walks over and pulls out an A. WHAT THE FUCK?! Anyways, the man does  not  like me. Maybe he can tell that I really am just in that class for the nice juicy "AP" tag that comes along with it. Ugh, no teacher has been able to see right through me like that before. I don't like it. So... should I go see him, get all my personal flaws exposed, my ass chewed out for not giving a flip, and forced to do  another  excruciating overnight write, or take my chances with my beast of a mother? I decided I'd try the latter.  The problem is that my mom is unpredictable. I don't know why I ever told her that I had to rewrite this goddamn paper, I was probably just venting my rage. But anyways, somehow I told her. And 2 months later, she hasn't forgotten about it. I mean, she proofread the goddamn thing! Last year, in Mr. Kelly's class, a paper as  well structured and content-rich  as that one, proofread by my mom would have gotten me an A. This year, apparently, my best isn't good enough, at least when it comes to my writing. My best gets me an "R."  Dear Mr. Anderson, You can cram that R right up your superliberal utopian cheese-eating premature-balding ass! You're a cool guy. I laugh at your jokes and your impressions, your thoughts are tremendously intriguing. But if you want respect, you gotta give respect. And all I've gotten this year is the cold shoulder, if not a written slap to the face. Explain to me, oh wise one, why every teacher drools uncontrollably over every paper I write for them,  except you . If you need, oh let's say four months to think about it, that's perfect. We can just continue our little dance of discrimination and apathy until my mom blows up and my grade sinks to the darkest depths of the ocean. Now if you'll excuse me, I have 30 notecards to write. That's just perfect since I had planned to spend most of today with my girlfriend. Oh and yeah, one more thing. The Panthers are going to the superbowl. Are you trying to destroy what should have been your classes' happiest weekend in a long time? You can sure be a prick, Mr. Anderson.  Sincerely, JD
