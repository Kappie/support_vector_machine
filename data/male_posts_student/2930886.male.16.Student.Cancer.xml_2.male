Working on an essay right now, that i thought i did really well, and so did a few other people but i got a fucking C-! that annoys me, you know what else annoys me right now, that people who dont work dont do anything in track are throwing much better than me, Dan Parez, who has never thrown a shot in his life already is throwing 33, and im throwing like 28. Well i also broke 100 in Jav today which is good, but still pretty bad compared to everybody else
