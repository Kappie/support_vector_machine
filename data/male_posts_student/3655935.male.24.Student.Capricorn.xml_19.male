Recently, I have meditated on Wesley’s  urlLink "Address to Clergy" , which should be required reading for all Christians. In this address, Wesley has two aims: "First, What manner of men ought we to be? Secondly; Are we such, or are we not?"  Wesley investigates matter of character, calling, and education. Just about every minister I know (including myself) can improve on these matters. Moreover, his standard for education among the clergy seems very distant from what is expected of ministers. He challenges the clergy to be learned in logic, history, Biblical languages, philosophy, the sciences, and detailed knowledge of the early church and its "Fathers." When I was in seminary, if they required ministers to do all of the above, most of the students would have become communication majors. But I side with Wesley on this issue. Sure, it’s a lot of stuff to learn, but isn’t it important to be prepared for one’s calling to follow God than to take the easy road? At one time ministers were considered intellectual giants in their community. You be the judge as to what they have become today.
