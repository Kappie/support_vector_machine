Only problem with that is sometimes I step on the gas before I shift, and eventually I'm bound to stall. But hey, maybe everything happens for a reason, or maybe thats just another Hollywood clich√©. Either way, I know there are things to do. Am I doing them right now? Well obviously not. I can't read with thoughts in my head, so I suppose that pouring them out on to this LCD screen will help.  Last night I noticed something about a show I rarely ever watch. It's that evil one called "the Real World." I guess they were playing reruns last night of old episodes, and being that I had never really watched an episode, I tuned in for one. Now, keep in mind this was at 4:00 in the morning, and I really wanted to go to bed, I was just... you know, curious for one reason or another. So, all this stuff happens in the episode, and they leave it hanging at the end. I must say, thats a very good marketing scheme, because I watched the next rerun, and the next, and the one after that. It just kept going on until I realized it was nearly 7:00 in the morning!   I don't know what it is thats so attractive about that show, but I think I can trace it to the fact that its hilarious that those people will complain about petty problems constantly. I think that because we all have our own tiny problems, we are very intrigued to find out about other people's. Sure, I'm no philosopher (and if you consider me to be, get your head checked,) but I just believe people feel more comfortable and assured when they get to see that other people have problems too.   Who knows.  The one thing that I thought was really cool after they had shown all the episodes was that they had a special with the boyfriend of the gay guy on the show. Now, as I understand it, the guy, who was named "Paul," was a captain in the military. Bill Clinton enacted a protocol called "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," which basically means that homosexuals can serve in the military so long as they don't participate in sexual activity and they are not open about their sexual preference. I guess thats fair enough. That meant on the show, they were forced to blur out Paul's face because of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," but what he ended up admitting was that he was scared shitless. He said that there was once a murder in the barracks next to his because another soldier suspected his comrade of being homosexual, went a little (very) crazy, and beat the guy's head in with a bat. I think that is a cause for concern. He also said that potentially, just by being on that show (blurred out or not,) his career was on the line. I think it is completely wrong that a person like him who served eight long years in the country's military should be forced to blur his face out because he has a "different" opinion about sexuality.   Just goes to show how rude typical Americans can be.  I could go on and on, but for sake of your eyes and my fingers, lets just end it here.
