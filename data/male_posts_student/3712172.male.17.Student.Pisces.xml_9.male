So you guys can give me a holler on my cell and I will call you back. Anyone wishing to goto Berries tonight, call me :)  Right now I am listening to  My Beat - Blaze  it's an awesome song. Last night I got bored so I went thru all my old CD's and stuff. Brings back memories of way back in the day.    *Sigh*  so innocent those days. Whatever caused human innocence to dissipate? And don't give me the Adam  Eve story. We were all innocent as babies, then we grew up. I think humankind knows too much for their own good. And we all use it to our advantage. So much selfishness, greed, and hatred. It's sickening. I dread reading the news everyday; it's pretty bad our world is in the state it's in. There is no such thing as respect anymore. The world is so corrupt I don't even think respect has its own definition anymore. People are miseralble, depressed, and selfish. The world relies mostly on "looking out for number one". That's not the way it should be.  Society, in my perspective, is nothing but a mere experiment. And I think we've disproved it's hypothesis.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   I should get going to work. Bye all.
