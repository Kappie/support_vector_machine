She's calico, with white paws that look like socks, huge ears, and no tail. :) Very cute. I really, really wish I could keep her because she's so sweet and seems to really like me and like my house (tons of places to explore and get stuck in.) Unfortunately, my sweet kitty Nutmeg doesn't really like having the kitten around, although both of my dogs seem to have already adopted her. I'd really really like to find a nice home for Marlena (Marley) but so far no one's been able to take her. :( I will keep her if I have to, but I don't want to make the cat I have now mad. Anyway, besides having a new kitten in my house for a while, lots of interesting things have happened today. The weather's been absolutely crazy. For the entire time that Lizz, Chloe, Angela, Andy, Austin, Alex, Sean and I were outside walking all over the Woodlands and putting up "Found Kitten" posters, it was VERY hot and humid. Basically terrible. As soon as we got home, though, it started pouring. We ran around in the rain for a few minutes, and then some of us went inside to put our swimsuits on so we wouldn't ruin our clothes out in the rain. We came back out to sunshine just like it had been before-and no rain at all. :( A little disappointing, but another good thing happened! Anthony and I finished the Tolle Katze!! (the "go-cart" that almost never was....and still isn't quite.) I pulled Anthony around the neighborhood for the first run, and then he pulled me on it. I flew off into somebody's yard, so then it was Lizz's turn, and then Andy's. It was VERY fun. Oh yeah, great fun!!   Call me about the cat if you want her and can give her a good home.   :)
