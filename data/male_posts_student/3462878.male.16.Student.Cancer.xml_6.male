All the Portuguese people will say it's because of their superior players, BULLSHIT IT WAS!!   IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT BENT REFEREE!!  What the fuck was wrong with John Terry?! He was watching the ball, he went up for the ball, and it just so happened that he HAPPENED to TOUCH the shoulder of the Portuguese keeper, therefore cancelling the WINNING GOAL AND MAKING IT THEN GO TO BASTARD PENALTIES  I'm sure everyone also knows that England always lose penalties, and that BASTARD referee just wanted to see us go out.   The linesman gave the goal!! I have no (real) problem with linesman, just bent referees! Generally the ref takes the opinion of the linesman, BUT NOOOOOOOO, he had to just fucking ignore the linesman, and give it in their bastard favour!!!  Grrrr, bastard...
