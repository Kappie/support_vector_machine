It kind of sucks, but if life gives you lemons then make lemonade. I am 16 years old and am going to my junior year in high school, La Salle Academy. However, thats going to be in a few weeks. Recently I have been trying to look for a job cause I desperatly need the money. There's alot of stuff that I   want and need but I have no money. And i would ask my parents but they have their own things to pay off so I will feel bad if i take their money. Also, i began jogging every morning cause i gained some pounds during the july so that pissed me off cause i am unemployed and getting fat! Hopefully I lose the weight i gained b4 school starts.  Let me see what else is new..... Oh yea I am planning 2 do a new hair style so if u c me i have a afro growing cause i am growing out my hair. I tried to comb it down but it is pretty much unmanagable without a hair product, which i told myself i wouldn't use until i do a different hair style. Its a persional challenge cause i always wear gel. LOL I will probably post a b4 and after pic of my hair. Well, dats pretty much wats has been happening 2 lately. THis has been a description of many days of my life.
