Didnt know where my journey with you will start... Or when it will end...  I couragely went to the beach on our first date... It was quiet, scenic, beautiful.... It felt like Ive known you for years.... I had full trust in you not to let my world come tumbling down...  You had your big strong hands around my thick waist.. It felt so ticklishy good and the sense of security is undescribable... Then our lips met.... You took me in like a hungry wolf...  Our affair was nothing but high impact aerobics... I like you alot so very much and i got so much to offer, But the ego in me striked back.. But also, you didnt fight for me....  Then i realised you didnt like me for what I am... Using me just to fulfil your lost dreams... Its all absurd and can't imagine how dumb i became... Im a smart lass but with you i turned dumbstruck...  You sang for me Sunshine from Gabrielle..... And I'll think of u when it came blasting over the radio... It became a sad song.... Seriously literally I could cry....  I never cried for you.. I never cared for you For u never did vice versa....  I was so depressed and angry... Ran away to Thailand for a week.. Saw the buddhist deity, buried my sorrows in the earth of Bangkok... Every single minute i think abt you...  I searched for you when i came back... You're no where to be found.... The feeling of hate started to come out... and finally it all came out....  you had another partner....  I was so extremely depressed but manage to control my emotions... for we were not a couple... But somehow i felt cheated whatever it is life has to go on  i said goodbye on April 28th It all lated for 2 months... It was all sad.... I sobbed quietly in the bus journey back home...  Hey buddy, thanks for everything.... But its your lost.... u lost me... big mistake...  I got so much to offer and u cant see that... hey budd.. u lost me... Take care
