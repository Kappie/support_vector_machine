That's a very young age to die at by today's standards, but after hearing her story, I feel a kind of solitude in her passing away. It sounds a bit macabre, but listen to her life.  Her sister or mother, one of them, was a multi-cash-millionaire, as in they have millions of dollars in cold, hard cash in the bank. She owned most all of the farming in eastern Colorado, so you can imagine how much money this woman raked in. When my aunt turned 60, her family threw her out in a farm house with no car and no telephone. She lived there all alone with no way to contact the outside world, surviving only off her wits. However, before that, her husband used to be very abusive. The kind of person who would beat his wife so bad she would lose consciousness. You can imagine how "great" her life used to be. The thing that makes no sense is that they put her away when she was only 60 years old. A multi-cash-millionaire wouldn't support her own family and so they just did away with her. Its fucking disgusting. Her last years must have been torture.  That is why I was so happy to hear she passed away. I'm sure in death she finally found peace.
