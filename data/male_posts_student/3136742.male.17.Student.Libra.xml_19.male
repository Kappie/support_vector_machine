It seems everywhere I turn there are pubes waiting, lurking in the shaddows, eager to skeeve me out. Am I the only one noticing this problem?  There's one source I can positively identify; a certain aquaintence of mine who recently, at the embarrassing age of 16, finally started sprouting body hair in places other than his head. He was just so garsh darned proud of himself that he had to pluck out a pube and leave it on the toilet seat or in the shower everywhere he went, so as to say "look at me, I'm a big boy now."  And what's with pubes on the soap?! My sister and brother must have balding crotches or something. Every time I get into the shower after either one of them there are five or so little black curly hairs delicately decorating the soap. When I'm done with the soap the only thing you'd be able to find would be bubbles!  Two days ago I had to shower in my parents bathroom while my mom painted my bathroom (it looks awesome now). So I draw the curtain to their shower and there, waiting at my feet as if to say "Hello, friend, I've been expecting you," was a patch of freshly shorn, salt-and-peppered, (possibly scrotal) parental pubes. Joy! Just what I wanted to see! And of course I couldn't let them swim about my feet as I showered, so I had to clean them up. Yak!  A while back Kris pissed in my toilet and left a pube on the seat. I don't know how people don't notice that shit; I know I've never been guilty of an absent-minded pube misplacement. Mine stay where they are. They're quite comfortable where they are... Kris blamed it on the Gary the Pube Gnome (I'm pretty sure he's related David the Gnome).  Today in work I went to take a piss. I walked up to the urinal, and there, on top of it, at over four feet off the ground, sat a lone pube gaurding the flush-knob. I had no clue that Shaquile O'Neil went to Widener Law School! What acromegalic freak manages to get a pube on top of a urinal without noticing it and knocking it in to flush it?  And why is it that all the pubes I find laying around are all full length? Is this the 1970's? I thought people trimmed up.?. I do, if not to use my brother's beard trimmer for something gross, than to keep from my crotch from shedding like a black lab in August. Seriously, who the hell is attracted to a full bush anymore? It doesn't necessarily bother me, aesthetically speaking, but it does get in the way of what you want to do. And totally bald isn't good either; it's too adolescent. So trim up folks. Blargh!....  I had A LOT more to say about this but I totally lost it all... so... DERP!  -------  I read the word "ignoble" at least three times today. That's way too much for a word like that for one day.    NP: Blind Melon- Self Titled. Without a doubt, the best band of the 90s. So sad what happened to Shannon. It's still hard for me to think about. What a great artist-- If anyone ever went way too soon it was him :-(.
