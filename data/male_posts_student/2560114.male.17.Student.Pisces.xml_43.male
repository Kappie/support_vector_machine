I think that the thing that can take the most beating and still keepz fighting no matter the consequencez...is my heart. No matter what my mind sayz...my heart will try to prove it wrong. My love for her is sooooooo strong...my heart is unstoppable. But my mind is equally as strong and tries to bring it down(its kinda like a neo and agent smith thing...kinda lame). But right now...my mind is winning...im just waiting for some oppurnity or something to happen that will make my heart show my mind wrong. Well still depressed...later dayz
