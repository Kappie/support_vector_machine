Which brings to why I have changed my name from the brilliance of “kinky_underpants” to “the yanking yankee”. For the record, I’m not actually a yankee. But in doing so, I stress the point that I am the one who lives in the U.S. Which brings me back to my first point. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t even move from the seat that I’m in now. I would sit here allllllll day. Maybe not here. Because my computer sucks. Maybe if I had a spaceship...... But I digress. The point is that I would be happy living my life within a square meter. All I’d need would be a fridge, Some entertainment, and something that could pose as a washroom. I’d just get people to bring me whatever I need! Like Gimpy from undergrads! Brilliant lad, I say. Instead I pass from city to city, province to province, country to country like the town whore (thank you Matt!). When I’m gone from Ohio and I’m going to university in.... anywhere but here... I’m going to go out of my way to live my dream. Except I may have to leave for classes and garbage...... Actually screw that. I could always make a living....... Carving and selling lawn gnomes! It works on the sims! (thank you dark lily!)    -The Yanking Yankee (louis)    lol
