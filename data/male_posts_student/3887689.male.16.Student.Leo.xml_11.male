But if you do it because you think it's wrong to eat animals, then I got three words for ya, pal: "IT'S FUCKING NATURE!". Animals eat other animals to survive. That's how nature worked, works, and always will work. And if you think you're somehow reducing the suffering of animals by not eating meat, you are wrong again, because if you don't eat it, it's just gonna grow old, suffer, and die anyway. Who are you to defy nature, you self-righteous fucks? Think you're so goddamn moral because you don't eat animals. I'll kill you!
