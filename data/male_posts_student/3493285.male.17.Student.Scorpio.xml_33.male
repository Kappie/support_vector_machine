SORRY. well right now it is 12:37 AM and i still have about 2 hours left of homework to do. school is fun. but not really actually.  melody wrote something in my yearbook that i thought was pretty cool: To be able to see a rainbow you have to endure the rain. i like that. even though it's kinda girl-ish it's a pretty comforting thought.   i honestly have no idea what the point of this post is anymore.  something i've been pondering a lot lately: this idea of karma. well not really karma, but well yes i guess karma. i've been finding myself thinking that well if i do this bad thing that i will enjoy, then a bad thing will happen to me--what goes around comes around. and i find it to be true. however, i really dont know if it's one of those things where i find it because i'm looking for it, or if it is actually happening.  weird.  i also think it's weird how time can change things. really bizarre. you know what? i used to really not be able to stand devin mcnichol. i really didnt. i'll be honest, i think i was pretty dang jealous of him. but now, D is one of my best friends. i love the guy and trust him completely. ironic? definitely.   on the contrary, a lot of people that i used to really love a lot and respect immensely have slowly dissenegrated into people that relaly dont matter to me, and while i still love them..they are not as important part of my life anymore..  i'm reading htis book and it preposed that all people, no matter how wonderful they are, are only truly interested in whats best for them. something i will be thinking about these next few days.  i should probably return to my english/tok homework now. farewell, oh i think people really should start using htat more. it's such a nice way to end things. i hope you fare well. see isnt that pleasant?   NEIL
