I don't know how i could have survived the past couple years without knowing this many people that knew exactly what I was going through- I'd probably be so insecure these days... not knowing that there were people who thought like i do.  Seriously, I thought it was me and Todd, and that was it. It basically still IS it, noone else besides Todd, Syed and I in irving are actively non-christian.  I have to thank the COA people for all the good times, all the funny times, all the serious times.  I hope everybody still has their little flame we got in OWL. I would wear mine, but i need to find a bigger loop for it, it chokes me :).  All the times we laughed with eachother, all the times we got back at eachother.  I know this all sounds cheesy, especially for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about, but seriously, in retrospect, which one of you were REALLY looking forward to OWL? I know I wasn't. I didn't want to go. Now where are we? It's only friday(technically saturday... whatever) and I already can't wait until our little hour and a half 'class' on sunday morning. I loved every minute of boston. Like I said when I started this webjournal, i don't think anybody else could have made that trip anywhere near as good as it was.  And so... in no particular order...  AJ: Definitley... different. You were one of the main factors I ended up staying awake all night at the lockins, and why I stayed up so late in boston. Always something new :-D You seriously rock, man.  Chloe: Really, what can I say that can accurately describe you? Hillarious, intelligent, respectable, intelligent, insightful, intelligent, funny, did I mention intelligent? There aren't enough words in the english language*, should I switch to German? Nein, I shall not.   *That I can think of right now- you have to remember- it's 1:15 in the morning when i wrote this.   Erik: You missed boston, but still you are always up for doing some crezzy schtoof, and for that i have to commend you.  Katie: Definitley the one who kept us from getting way out of hand, I can't IMAGINE what kind of trouble we would all be in if katie hadn't been there to knock some sense into our dense, misguided heads. We definitley have to thank you for that one. You're a great person as well, I bet I speak for everyone when I say that a large chunk portion of the 'soul' of the boston trip if you hadn't made it...  Douglas: Definitley one of the most sensible people I have ever met, also one of the main reasons we all didn't get killed on the subway :-D Always up for a laugh, you were a great help raising money for the boston trip, and you also stepped forward to have a picture party, I seriously doubt anyone would have made that initiative.  Sarah: Whoo, good times, eh? My head is still itching from that salt. You often were the one who taught us that sometimes it's good to stray from the rules, that you have to go out on a limb sometimes to make things work. Remember the Wizard of Oz party? Methinks you were the one who figured out the winning combination, even though i almost made us suffer a broken board :-O ... We sure got gary back, that'll teach him not to mess with us. Unbreakable. Never a dull moment.  Nick: Where'd ya go, guy? We're still in touch though, FCOHE is going strong and has no sign of slowing down!  Carly: Our UU/Horizon pro, also one of the most thoughtful people i've ever met. Thanks for the Blue Man Group newspaper article! I'll have fun reading it :-D You were i think the biggest help from the team in raising money, weren't you the REASON we have that extra $1400 left in the funds? It was your hard work(and burned hands) that set COA on the right track to money-dom. You probably deserve more of a share of the money then the rest of us do(assuming we split it... hehehe).  That's my 2 cents(2 dollars) for today- I bet I'm forgetting a person or two that deserves to be on here, but it's 1 in the morning, i've been up for over 18 hours, time for the bed. If I did forget anybody, please tell me before said forgotten person(s) feels bad, and I can edit this post.  -Snider  P.S. I would have written a song or something, it's really a pity that I have NO musical talent whatsoever(cant play guitar, can barely play piano), except the drumbone, and i'm experimenting with my mom's dulcimer, but right now all I have are words. Bon Appetit'
