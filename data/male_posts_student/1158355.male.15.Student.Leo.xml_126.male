It was actually really funny having Ashley massage me in the middle of the field (not the football field) with me on the ground and her giving me orgasms...ok that's enough. It was fun. I basically screwed Paul, Kira, Jess and some other girls and hung out with Ashley, Kate and Marissa. We just roamed around basically and all...and when I got home, my Chris my cousin was over (well he was here before I left to the game also) and we watched the Yankees lose. )= Then played some Star Wars on gamecube...the new game called Rebel Strike and then I asked out Ashley. She said yes! Woo! I love you Ashley. Ok that's it bye.
