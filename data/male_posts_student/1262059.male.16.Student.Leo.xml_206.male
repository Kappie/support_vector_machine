Wow, that doesn't seem like too long, yet it seems like forever since this has been updated ^^;;   ok ok, let'see...  not much has happened, actually... been spending much time on English Unit 5 website (see  urlLink here  for the results of that).    Also, I've been spending time on Gunbound ^^ right now, my avatar is equipped with marine helmet, school uniform, rimless specs, and - costing my entire fortune - golden hammer. Just became a double stone axe, which means i'm barred from the newbie servers =\ ahh.. highest damage so far is 800+ w/ Grub's ss, then 750ish (Grub) and 700+ (Boomer). Been playing with Joe, kyle, phil, mike... um.. i think that's about it.    Besides that, chinese new year provided me with around 20-50 dollars so far ^^;; usually i net around 100-150 every year, and 100 goes to bank for savings, while the rest of it tides me over for an entire year =P (i spend very little as i don't get to go out often anyway). Better than money... chinese new year provided lotsa sugar!! SUGAR = GOOD!    Yesterday, went to parent's friend's house for more chinese new year celebrations. Forget the name of the person... but the house brings back memories... it's a pretty big house which I haven't seen for over a year or two, since it's usually adults and kids that go to such gatherings. Teens usually stay at home =P    I remember playing scavenger hunt with a bunch of people in the backyard... and the kid that fell into the tub of water with watermelons (only my sister would know what I'm talking about =P )... and other random moments. Interestingly, the two kids I was with yesterday, were about my age back then ^^;; the "second generation", lol. Not as fun for them tho =\ not as many people either.    Oh, and it's the year of the Monkey, for those that don't yet know.    In any case, the future promises to be busy: first dragonboat practise tomorrow, business day on wednesday, religion retreat and waterloo practise on thursday. Oh, and lotsa people have semi on friday.    Ah... and just found out Focus project was due tomorrow or the day after ^^ what fun   ~Chronos
