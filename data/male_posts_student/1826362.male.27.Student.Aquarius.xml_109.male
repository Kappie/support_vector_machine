Lauren's Mom's turkey was wonderful, nice and juicy and tender, and all the fixins were great.  We mad this amazingly heavy bread pudding from a reciopie we found online and it turned out good too.  Woburn won the turky bowl, i believe, because of our big Woburn hearts.  It's really no surprise that we would beat out a bunch of white collar prep school chums who live in Winchester but all have glass houses on the cape.
