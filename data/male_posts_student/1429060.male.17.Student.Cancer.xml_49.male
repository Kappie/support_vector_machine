This includes Elise, Alanna, Brock, Katherine D., Laylee, Jenny, Margaret, whoever else wants to join...We  are  going to have a party in the library this Sunday before all of us die in a flowery shine of sparks under the grinding heel of Wexler. I am collaborating as to time and whatnot (keep in mind that we will likely be on the sociology floor of the main/central library, with literatures and religions). This needs to happen people, lest we are smited by malicious deadlines due to the  evil-infused bloody  50 flash note cards. And god knows I need some happy drugs in the form of social interaction this weekend. So says my therapist.  Let the slackers and procrastinators of the world unite!
