Thats right, Tyson has a fucking EyeToy. For those of you not in the know, an EyeToy is a little peripheral device of sheer brilliance for one's playstion two. It is a small USB camera that you attach to your PS2, and it superimposes you in any of the twelve games it comes with. I know it sounds stupid, but the entire interface for the EyeToy, from the menu to the games, is done through your body. Its therefore perfect party game, as you get to watch people make complete buffoons of themselves as they try to swat away little ninjas or dance to the beat on screen. Genius I say! Add in the fact that I got it for fifteen bucks becuase the Sony store in Chicago was having a 'closing its doors' sale, and everything is golden!  Chicago was fun, the delightful immaturity of a family trip. I got to see my oldest sister who shares my brother and I's birthday (she is twenty-one now) who is pretty cool I guess. I also got the see my other older sister, who was born on May Twelfth but still gets a birthday card and money from my stepmom, who isn't simply stupid, but is more of a mobile void of knowledge, manners, and intuition, actually taking those away from those near by her horrifying presence. My other sister can actually be a lot like my stepmom, so she has her own painful moments. Brother was there to, no particular problem with him. But enough of my family, as the trip is the thing! I know you're all dying to hear what I did in Chicago so...TOO BAD! Hah, I deny you your Tyson sustenance for the day! Thats right, suffer as you did in my absence, like a flower struggling to survive without the nourishing rays of the sun! Ok fine - second city, bull's game, Splendors of the Forbidden City during the Glorious Reign of Qianlong (1736-179'5', when he 'abdicated and continued to unofficially rule the country for four more years) which was awesome indeed, and other random shit. There, now you have my trip - read it again and again so you can feel a modicum of the pleasure that my company always brings.  But now, its time to get down to more serious matters. Those of you linked from my....I shudder to say...xanga (which with two entries telling people to come here still compares favorably to the greater body of xangas out there) know of what I speak. On Wednesday, March 31st - the first wednesday after break for you Pembroke People - Student Goverment Presidential elections shall be held. I for one do not intend to give the performance I gave in the past five elections I through myself into, even embarassing myself in front of six hundred moronic Yiggists. No, I will no longer be a nice guy. This exact location in time and space calls for something a little more 'dramatic', if you catch my drift. My only competition I know for sure is Joe Reardon and Aroop Mukharji, along with rumors of Emma Cohen, whom each present unique problems. Joe is brilliant and a great guy, but a tad stale. Some say that will work against him, but I personally believe that his unique form of humor (that is, no humor) which will deliver all sort of clean, dry jokes will be so cute as to be funny. Thus Joe has the tiny puppy angle to work from. Aroop is actually somewhat funny and unlike me (having been banned from the stage since freshman year) is actually somewhat known by the entire school. But what Aroop hasn't been is be a member of student Goverment, except for the one semester at the beginning of Freshman year which was enough to qualify him and perhaps as Julia's secreatary or something,  so he has a weak experience record. Emma, well she's a girl and a great person at that so she could dramaticaly cut the vote simply by appealing to femnists and the like. Thus, I need a campaign that will grind every last one of them into not dust, not the molecules that form that dust, or even the atoms or quarks that form that, but into the very theoretical Higgs Bosons that cause mass to appear in most objects in the universe. And if I'm wrong, don't fucking stop me I'm on a roll. So not only do I need a concerted poster movement, with a sprinkle of door handles, but I need nametags, shirts, you name it. Most of all I need my loyal gestapo to help me destroy the competition. My feeling is for a nice Deaniac flavor this year, with all the squaks, flash get togethers, and such that come along with that style. My speech will be prepared by an expert committee to ensure full wit this year. Any ideas for how to support the campaign can be posted  in the chatterbox or comments. But I'll need a loyal core to be laiden down with shirts, candy, and name tags to hand out for those two and a half days we get to campaign. If you're willing to be my Deaniac, simply post and I'll do my best to get shirts, nametags, and the like to you. This is my year damnit! They may have pushed me to the side like so much spoilt milk last year, but I shall overcome! ICH BEN EIN PEMBROKE! DIE KUNST IST GOD, TYSON UBER ALLES!  Oh and Emma B, I know very well of Alex's  urlLink xanga  and hold it as one of the shining stars that threaten to destory my perception of xanga as a whole. I simply do not link to it for I already link to Sam's. Sam's links to four or five blogs/xangas, which include Alex's. You see, I very much promote the idea of self-discovery when it comes to these things, making all the more magical. It is how I found them all. Sam's links mostly link in a self referential group, but Alex's is not so. He may have no links 'per se' but he has a plethora of comments. Each one of those comments link to a xanga which may be a real one or a merely a placemat link for the user's actualy blog, diary, live journal, or whatever, many of whom link to someone new. Its like starting at the top of a pyramid or the center of a spiderweb and spreading further and further out - quite fascinating really. And my own perception of you remains quite resolute and firm.   Shit I stink! I need a shower. And on that less than glorious note I'm off!
