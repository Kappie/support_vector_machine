O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command.  With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free!  From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
