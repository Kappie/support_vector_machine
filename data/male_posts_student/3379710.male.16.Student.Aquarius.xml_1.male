(I guess)  > The Dragoness: Volume I  > A Legend Reborn    > Written By Ryan Crowther  > May 18, 2004                                                 Prologue                                  The Remittance of the Dragon Race     It was long ago in the medieval world we now call Terra.  Nearly seven hundred years ago, a great war began to spawn between two races of a once rather peaceful coexistence.  The world’s Imperial Army was at rest for what seemed like another decade in the eternity of its history and life was, at the very least, good for everyone.  The human race had built magnificent kingdoms of marble and stone during the many years of solitude to glorify the lasting peace.  Many stories were told of encounters with dragons and their massive underground citadels, for which it was deemed that no man could ever find.  And this belief held true for every human in the world of Terra, for no one had set eyes upon the vast cavities underground, although many expeditions were led to seek them out.  All of these, however, were to no avail.  Many people created images in the minds of children depicting castles made entirely of a magical metal called mythril, that was nigh impervious to any other substance in the world, forges whose tempering blazes were hotter than volcanoes, and statues of epic proportions that occupied underground chambers that were greater in size and depth than the largest of lakes on the surface of Terra.  Some even suggested that these marvels were only the beginning, and that many of the dragons had established kingdoms in the clouds, as well.    And so it was that the humans looked upon the dragon race with an unyielding respect, such that even the wicked wouldn’t dare to stare scornfully at the solemn face of the huge, winged beast.  And the dragons smiled with amusement at the activities of the human race, as they seemed to mill about in their own world, oblivious to what the high heavens may have in store for them in the near future.  The dragons had been very happy with their role as the guardians of Terra and they often looked to the stars to predict any upcoming events that may need preparation.  During the many decades that were such a short part of their life, the dragons had found little need to look to the stars, for the vast reaches of space were scintillating tranquilly without a shadow of a doubt.  In fact, many dragons grew curious about the lives of the humans and would pay short visits, often to see what it was like to sleep on the loamy, grass-covered soil in a forest, the rough but soothing grains of sandy beaches or the rugged and rocky terrain of the mountains and highlands.  The humans’ encounters with dragons were hardly confrontational.  Although most dragons didn’t appreciate being disturbed from their slumber, they were easily consoled if they were told a good story or given an interesting or perishable gift.  But what the humans failed to realize was that these friendly meetings would soon come to an abrupt end.    It still isn’t certain today, but something in the stars caused a conflict to arise between the dragons and they turned on each other, being on opposing sides of the argument.  Soon, the humans were caught in the middle of their turmoil; earthquakes tore up the land beneath them, lightning filled the sky above them, lava flow from volcanoes scorched the earth around them and floods and hurricanes swept along the coastlines nearby.  Everyone began to panic and those that weren’t already killed took what food was left and hid themselves away in the mountainside.  A few neutral dragons searched the torrent of destruction on the surface of Terra hoping to take some humans to a safer place, but no one believed their intentions and now that Terra was slowly being destroyed, there wasn’t any safe place to witness the looming apocalypse.    Through the course of six fierce months, the surface of Terra was devastated and the populations decimated, but even the dragons had succumbed to such horrible environments and the raw power of their own elemental attacks.  Soon, the quivering of the earth ceased with the fighting and the humans, stricken by starvation and a brutal thirst, emerged to see that their once beautiful planet was on the verge of extinction itself or so it seemed.  With the few dragons that remained in a desolate silence, the human race was able to rise up once again from the ashes of its home world and as the kingdoms began to be restored, so did the land and sea.  The earth ceased to tremble and the fissures created new mountains, the sky, once filled with black and the blue-white flashes of lightning in the reflection of the pouring rain, was restored with the subtle docility of the soft, low-hanging clouds, the forests, marred by the burns of pyroclasmic flows, gave birth to new plant life from the rich deposits of soil, and the oceans’ once tempestuous and violent natures were restored with gently rippling waves and friendly winds for sailors.  And so some say that the world of Terra had begun anew, brimming with life and viridian color just as it once did before what was called The Great Renewal.    The humans knew that the dragons were the cause of such an onslaught, and so it was that through the next six months, several crusades were led to put an end to the dragon race, the so-called guardians of Terra.  Villagers still encountered the dragons near their very dwellings at times and the confrontations were catastrophic.  If a man were to come face to face with a dragon, he would neither fight nor run, but wait for the inevitable; an almost certain death.  Many lives were taken only by chance encounters such as these and the few survivors died shortly afterward.  The people’s vengeance drove the soldiers of the quickly regrouping Terran Imperial Army to seek out and smite all of the dragons but one, whom no man in his right mind would confront, let alone attempt to kill.  Auron, the legendary King of the Dragons, was his name, which no dragon would speak in vain.  A name that was holier and revered more than that of the Christian God.  Perhaps this was because of the fact that he was a known entity or maybe it was that the dragons had a stronger system of monarchy than any human could even imagine.  Whatever the reason, Auron, the great King of the Dragons, was said to be untouchable and invincible beyond that, and yet the Terran soldiers marched on for three months to find his underground kingdom, only to face him at the most desolate place on Terra.  It was the only place that still bore the scars from the carnage of the recreation.    The battlegrounds were nothing but a barren wasteland shrouded by a nigh impenetrable mist.  As the soldiers marched purposefully onward, they were cognizant of a subtle presence nearby.  Only then did Auron launch his surprise attack, and even the most wary soldiers had only seen a large shadow before their life was taken.  They did not see the razor-sharp claws and teeth like guillotines that shredded their very existence.  The only one who was spared was Commander Sylvia Reynard, who had cleverly disguised her identity and ascended to the top of the Terran Imperial Army by only a matter of deception and great courage.  She watched as the shadow stood still in the distance, focusing intently as though she would be slain in an instant if she were to look upon the myriad of dead soldiers strewn about the ground all around her.  And the fog lifted slightly and the sun hung straight above their heads at high noon.  The playing field was set and the match between the two clan leaders would soon begin.    Neither the blue nor the silver pair of eyes broke contact; both woman and beast shared an equal fury, an equal pain, and an equal determination.  Commander Reynard had already sustained a near loss of her life; her left arm had been torn from its socket several years ago by a dragon.  The wounds were cauterized and the limb was sewed back on by hand and she ignored all of the pain that she still felt from it as her eyes remained fixed on the twenty-foot beast with head bowed down in anger and claws poised to strike at any moment.  And Auron, now living with the pain of his clan’s near extinction, knows that this is a battle not to be won for his clan, but now only for himself.  There is no hope for him now, and he realizes that he fights only to live out the rest of his years in solitude as the last of his kind, never to come into existence again.  And so the fierce battle began with the clashing of sword on claw and after many bouts of parrying swift blows, it was clear that Auron had a huge advantage.  His size and speed could only contribute further to his already astonishing power, but Commander Reynard’s strength was unfathomable, especially for a woman clad in such heavy armor and it was for this reason that she had been able to fend off his attacks.    Auron’s mind began to wander and his concentration slackened slightly; he was planning to escape and leave Reynard to die in the arid heat of the sun, left completely exhausted.  And this was true, for the Commander was having strong second thoughts about this match-up and the cruel environment that would most inevitably claim her life first.  Auron glanced around and saw a faint rippling in the distance, just above the ground, but it wasn’t the reflection of the now very thin layer of mist that hung about them.  He had slowed down his attack frequency and this gave Commander Reynard the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on him for the first time.  The blade of the great sword came down mightily upon the claws of the startled King of the Dragons and his guard nearly collapsed under such a blow.  As he regained his composure, he was able to force Reynard’s sword away from him and both combatants faltered backward momentarily.  The moment turned into many seconds where the two leaders stared at each other, slowly becoming complacent.  At last, Commander Reynard buried the blade of her broadsword in the nutrient-starved soil and seeing this, the King of the Dragons folded his wings and lowered his claws.  He glanced to the side only for a second and Reynard eyed him warily as he looked at her sideways.  Then, without a trace of movement to betray his intentions, Auron flew straight into the distance and vanished before the Commander’s very eyes.  And she only smiled at his tenacity, for little did he know that shortly after the long and arduous solo journey back home, Commander Sylvia Reynard would set down her military equipment for eternity…
