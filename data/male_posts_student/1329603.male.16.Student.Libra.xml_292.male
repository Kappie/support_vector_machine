Have to go into school next Monday to see the bursar about it, that being the earliest that he's in. Bugger.  Spent last night at Joe's, it was OK until I went to sleep, then everything went haywire it would seem and Scott had to wake me up cause he needed a hand clearing up vomit and stopping Marx, Joe and Adam from dying, and I got stung, by a wasp, on my foot. I was not pleased. Oh well.  Really wanna meet up with either Laura, Fi, or Nikki... the shock may come as the one I most wanna meet up with is Nikki because I haven't seen her for an age but I'd really like to see any of them to be honest.  Fragmented post, I apologise.  I did an hour's piano practice today, and I suck. Seriously, if I pass my Grade 7 I'll be lucky. I'm having to completely learn how to do scales properly, and I've gotta teach myself how to do thirds and such and I've still to choose a B piece... this all with the exam at Christmas. And I need the new trombone really quickly so I have a chance of getting used to it before the audition. Balls.  Haven't had much sleep, am feeling lonely, and apprehensive about the amount of work I have to do.  Quote of the day: "Cigarettes and chocolate milk, These are just a couple of my cravings. Everything, it seems, I like's a little bit stronger, A little bit fatter, A little bit harmful for me."  From Rufus Wainwright's   Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk     Love, Jon Roskilly
