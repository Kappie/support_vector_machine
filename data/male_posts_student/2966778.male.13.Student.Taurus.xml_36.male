Here are some websites and things i want updates on.  If anyone is generous, please find out some info on these things: Pokemon games iPod serebii.net ipodlounge.com ign.com This connection's too slow for me to find this stuff in one shot and to check the HTML code for bullets. Later dudes.  Is time correct? It's 11:59PM/July 26th.  (That's in Dhaka, Bangladesh.)
