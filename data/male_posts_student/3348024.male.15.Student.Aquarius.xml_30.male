About the seventh or eighth time I was pulling into a spot when I noticed a lady in her forties walking by on the sidewalk with a smile on her face.  This wasn't the customary, "Brad, you're so hot, take your pants off now" type smile.  It was more like, "He He, giggle like school children, this kid's learning how to parallel park, I better run to my spot so he doesn't hit my car" type smile.  Or it could have been the, "Hey, I remember sixty-five years ago when I was learning how to parallel park.  If you think this is hard, try doing it with a horse and buggy."  Anyway, I thought this was worth mention.
