You know, those visits to see how grandmum is doing. Yeah. She's doing okay. Great! But my eldest uncle...sigh. Suffering from throat and lung cancer. Smoked cigarettes and drank beer too much la. See him like this also dunnoe what to say. See his X-rays...the lungs all blackened out. Sigh...  Alright, we went to Chinatown in the afternoon. Hmm? Wbhat we do there? We ate lunch lor. I ate the yong tau foo ar. Very famous one, that stall. The whole family ate that lor. Not bad la. After that leh, we went to shop at various shops lor. Like OG, some shop (which I forgot it's name) and various small shops around Chinatown. I brought two t-shirts and a shirts. Yay! Wardrobe expanded le. HaHa! Anyway, we ate again (sigh! brother la! want to eat the chicken noodles). Then, we went home to take a rest before going to eat dinner.   I played games until like 7. HaHa! We originally planned to eat seafood at restuarants near East Coast, but due to the late time, we decided to go to the restuarant at Toa Payoh. But sigh!! It was booked for a wedding dinner! I grumbled on the way out "I told you to go East Coast you don't want...see la...come here nothing to eat!". The people outside the restuarant (the parents lor) all looked at me with distaste. In the end, we ended up eating at KFC (Family Combo Meal). Mom and Dad promised another outing to eat at seafood restuarant....so yay (see WQ! What no money! YOU then no money!)! AFter that, we walked around Toa Payoh.  After that leh, we went to Causeway Point to buy water-bottles. Ayaih...no use one la, trying to protest about it. So,I chose a nice one. Hey! If I have to drink from a bottle, it has to be nice! Meow meow meow!  Today leh...nothing much happened la. The History test is somewhat difficult. Sigh!!Don't even know whether my highest levels correct or not. Sigh. Oh yeah. Today, Andi came to talk to me about going to chalet. He feels guilty about inviting Faiz along, which caused me and CQ not to go to chalet. So, he persuaded me to go to chalet. I didn't in the end. It's not Andi's fault lor. If that leech Faiz wants to tag along Andi, then it's not within Andi's control. So, Andi should not reproach himself for the presence of Faiz. I can see that he's a very loyal friend of Wendy. That's very good you know!   Okay. I gotta end this le. So late. Will update tomorrow. See ya tomorrow, blog. Nite!
