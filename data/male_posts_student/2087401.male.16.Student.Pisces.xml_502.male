I also met this girl named Merryl, and she's really cool.  Unfortunately, she lives in a trailer with no computer and no telephone, and I lost her address, so I can't send her letters.  Anyway, After sleeping on it for a couple of days, I decided that my departure from Compendium was a little rash and I'm back.  But we seriously need to do more blogging and less party planning. Ok?  And Rachel and Sophia - post more!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!
