A simple yes or no would do. If you want to you can always produce a longer answer, just make sure it is clear what you intend. It will  not  influence my decision in anyway, I am just curious as to who would and who wouldn't. Just leave a comment.  Thank you,  Colin Walker  -The Management-   urlLink Twice Double !
