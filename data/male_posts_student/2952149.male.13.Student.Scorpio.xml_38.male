Then I got to hear about some more gross STDs which made me feel real good about sex. Then in guitar I remembered I had to take home my guitar today so I had to text message my mom telling her to pick me up. Then in third period we read our letters that our parents wrote to us in August. My dad wrote some really nice stuff but for some reason I got really sad. Then in Math we had a Big 25 that nobody knew about. I was supposed to serve lunch detention today but I didn't. We had a test in Mr. Moser but we ended up talking about politics all period which is ok with me. In history we had a test and even though it was open-book I still think I did bad. At the end of sixth period we had to go to our homeroom from the beginning of the year. I had to go to Mr. Ryder who is like my favorite teacher. Atleast I got to talk to Jason during that time. Then I was planning on saying my final goodbye to Stacey...maybe a kiss or SOMETHING! But nooooo.....I couldn't even do that because since we had to go to our homerooms, after school I couldn't find where Stacey was...I looked all over. She told me that she was waiting by the stairs and then she went to my bus. So I must have looked by the stairs while she was at my bus. She looked for me by the bus but I was a car rider today. FUCK!! Im so pissed. Things just happened to work out in all the wrong ways today. Oh and I was supposed to spend the night at Austin's house but tonight his mom just changed her mind out of the blue and said that I couldn't. Now I am trying to call Stacey but I can't get through....today was fucked. *sigh*
