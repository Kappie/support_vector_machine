Sexism - Pretty simple reason this, correct me if I'm wrong here but a few religions I've looked into seem to have sexism in their teachings, for example, in the bible who is it that causes original sin? Eve! A woman! And the man merely gets dragged along in the whole affair. Now if that isn't sexism then I obviously deserve to beburnt at the stake. Makes me wonder why nuns exist. If I was a woman I definitely wouldn't be christian if I could help it.
