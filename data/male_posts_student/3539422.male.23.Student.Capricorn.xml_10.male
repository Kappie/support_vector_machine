Although the words “separation of church and state” never appear in the first amendment, they might as well be there now.  So engrained is this idea on our national conscience that even the pledge of allegiance has come under attack, in addition, prayer at high school football games and within the classroom.  Religion, in a certain sense has become enemy number one of activist judges.  It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to state that religion has come under attack in America.  Even though the majority of Americans consider themselves religious, the elite of this country, once again proving that they know better than we do, are attempting to erase the important role religion played in our nation’s founding.  Quote after quote can be pulled from the dialogues of the founding era affirming the benefits, even necessity, of religion and morality in public life.  Washington himself went so far in his Farewell Address to say that these two pillars are fundamental components of a successful republic.  Even Jefferson, probably the least “religious” of the founding generation, doubted that a state could function without Christianity.  De Tocqueville marveled at the religiosity of the American citizen.  Not being able to deny the prominent role religion occupied in the founding, attempts are now being made to dismiss religion in the founding era as “cultural” or “historical” conditioning.  “That was then, this is now.”   The idea that religious-inspired values and morals ought to remain outside the public debate would have sounded completely foreign to the founders.  While they affirmed reason’s ability to reach certain truths, they were doubtful that over time, reason alone would prove sufficient in guiding man along the path of moral truth.  As we all know, the only intent of the first amendment was to prohibit Congress from establishing a national religion and to ensure the freedom to worship as one pleases.  Today however, we have what Father Neuhaus calls the “naked public square.”  President Bush is accused of being a zealot, leading this country on his religious convictions rather than national interest.  The courts, which were intended by the founders to be the weakest branch of government, have arguably become the most powerful.  As we have discussed, politicians opposed to abortion are accused of “imposing” their religion on the electorate.  Bishops who speak out against abortion and warn politicians who support it are likewise criticized. The important social issues of the day such as life, marriage and the family, etc., are influenced more by the secular creed than any religious one.  What is the remedy for such hostility toward religion in public life?  How can we reclaim our nation’s appreciation for religion in the public square?
