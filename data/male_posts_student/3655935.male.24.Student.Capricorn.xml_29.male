One of the dividing issues on this subject is whether divine foreknowledge and human freedom are compatible.   Theological compatibilists  in accord with their name believe the two can intelligibly coexist, while  theological incompatibilists  claim they are not compatible.  Aside from my belief that there are solid arguments that demonstrate theological compatibilism, as a Christian I think there is another route I would take to safeguard my views against theological incompatibilism.  I recognize the Bible broadly portrays God with foreknowledge and humans as free, and if I can't figure it out, I assume it is beyond my abilities to figure it out.  To budge on either God's foreknowledge or human human freedom seems to risk sacrificing something too important.  I'd rather take God at his word and accept my own ignorance.  Fortunately, I am brilliant and have discovered some cogent arguments that show the rationality of my position.
