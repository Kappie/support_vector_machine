If Marty can't go then maybe I could get Kate to go.  It should be really insane.  Suicide Machines really know how to rock socks.  First day of work, easy.  Alot of the guys play stuff.  One plays guitar, and another plays drums...one guy said the father of the old drummer for suicide machines (Derek Grant) came in one day.  Apparently this guy was talking about the concert he went to with Alkaline Trio in it, and the guy said his son played in that band.  I did not know Derek went on to play with Alkaline Trio, it seems like a very odd change.  This is the same guy that was on  "Destruction of Definition"  by the  Suicide Machines , with all the insane ska beats...and he went from that to the slower beated alternative type music of Alkaline Trio.  Well, most drummers will play anything as long as they get to rock out.  Tomorrow I am going to the detroit zoo with Kate :).  That will be fun.  I hope they have monkeys >_  Oh yea, I added some more bands on the side bar for your browsing pleasure.  Tomorrow I will work on the "other" section, which is a tad dated.  I'm gonna go catch some Z's, I'm tired. Cya.  "scream if you want to,  that i never really loved you, you set me up to take the fall. you tell me that you loved me, and that you'd never leave me, yet im the one who's all alone." -9miles2go (download the song up at the top, and post a comment on it...just an idea...)
