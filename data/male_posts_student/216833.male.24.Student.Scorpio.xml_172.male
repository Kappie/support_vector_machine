I spent the morning at the brc going through some simple training on how to addmit birdies and different policies and i worked out my schedule with heather. I set up a little feeding station for all the birds around my apartment. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not all mister BIRD now, i just have something to do and I feel like I am helping something besides myself. You never know what kind of curve life is going to take, and this experience could, in the end, send me in a totally new direction. You never know sometimes.   Hi Ho Hi Ho - Off to work i go!!   current mood:  calm current music: Palatka - The State Of Gear
