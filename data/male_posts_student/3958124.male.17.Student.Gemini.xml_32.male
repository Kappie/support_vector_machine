If you had ever been to Siping's house before and seen his room, you know it was small and messy. My friends, Siping cleaned his entire room, rearranged, AND got ps2 with a TV. (Man, I need to go do something outside. My excitement over this is NOT a good sign...) We played some SSX3, DDR, and Kindom Hearts. I'm going to get a haircut. Fuck man, I was really hoping I could just let my hair go forever.   -Ok I definetly forgot I was writing this 10 hours ago-  Party is over and now I'm recovering from DDR. Trav skipped Liz's party, Siping skipped being at home, and Noah came over. John P. and Nick K. also dropped in for a stay, but eventually went to Liz's house.  So full and so tired. Less on my condition, sooner.
