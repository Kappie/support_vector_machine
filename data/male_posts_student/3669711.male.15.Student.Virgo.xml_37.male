Its about the restaurant Pia Carrot, and it's employees, but specificly 2 employies: Maeda Kouji and Hinomori Azusa, and how they were loved by 2 different people but loved each other.    One thing i really enjoyed about this series was the animation.  Some of the facial expressions were enough to make you laugh.  Lol, mostly Kouji's expressions, but a lot of them were really funny.  Another things that was good was how they split up the story.  It seemed to cover a lot of time in a minimal amount of episodes (6 to be exact).    The best part of all was the last episode, just before the series ended, Kouji and Azusa confessed their love for one another.  "I..." (Azusa) "I..." (Kouji) "Hinomori Azusa, I.." (Kouji) "Maeda Kouji, I..." (Azusa) "Love you!!" (Kouji) "Really love you!!" (Azusa).  Thats how it went.  Hehe, when they did say that, all i could do was say "w00000ttt"  Lol, i had been waiting for the whole week to hear that!    Anyways, if you want to watch a funny romance anime, but don't want an anime with a lot of episodes, Pia Carrot 2 DX is for you!  Lates
