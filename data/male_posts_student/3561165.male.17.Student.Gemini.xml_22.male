That book, I must say, almost managed to make me theistic, which I can say of no other literary, theological or other work. I'm not going to endelve into why and how and stuff, just read the book and no matter how atheistic you are, I am fairly adamant that by the end, you well see a new slant on the whole 'God' thing. I still need to start 'War and Peace'. I've had the book for about six months and it hasn't yet unfurled itself to my grubby paws, it judt looks, well, superfluous. I brought it to Yankee-doodle-dandy-land with the intention of reading it in the slumberly hours that I am spending in my bedroom tinkering with my guitar and keyboard in the vain hope that somehow from amongst the crude bulk of my form the genius that I have always believed is in me will reveal itself. The only problem being that it is failing to do so. Oh well, musn't whinge, either way. I also have decided that I can call myself an existentialist, because I looked up what it meant. I 've always (well, not literally) had a faint inkling of its meaning just never been able to definitively say . Yay, go me, I'm special. Also I learned a new word today; symbiotic. I'm doubly special, as the Doctor who diagnosed me as clinically insane once enthused. I've been excercising quite a bit too, in lieu of anything else to do.  I've been studying reams more of music theory, which hasn't been too pleasant. It all makes sense, but making it intuitive; the idea that when one plays a B followed by a C, it is a diminished second does not become instinctual very easily in a mind so encumbered by junk as my own. I guess I'm too self-concious about stuff like that, I could get neurotic about it. Speaking of neuroses, it seems that everyone in this country is on drugs of one kind or another, be they illicit, perscription or whatever. I know that that is perceptual and is making a ludicrous stereotype on the basis of little or no information, but all the same. I've never really become too immured in any type of druggery, especially not one involving cheap, ineffectual prescription drugs. The rule of the thumb, it appears is that we take a drug, and we feel better, with no consideration of any adverse side-effects or whatnot. So really, with the multiplicity of drugs that people love to ingest, we sicken ourselves by curing ourselves. We cure any maladies by supressing them with drugs which then go and invoke more maladies! Yay! Whatever happened to a good old six months of convalescence in a nunnery with the treatment of hot water, lemon n' honey and St. Johns wart? Oh well, that's life people want immediacy then they just create fleeting fixes and fuck themselves fully in the long run.  Anyway, I'm waffling now, aren't I. I'm just scribbling (well, not strictly scribbling, but all the same) an extended polemic of nonsense with no real purpose, simply because my life in this land of Messiah's, Morphine and Money is listless and awful. Bleugh.  Mood: Vacuous Music: The Mars Volta - Cicatriz ESP; The Mars Volta - Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt; The Mars Volta - Son et Lumiere/ Inertiatic ESP; The Cure - The End of the World Quote of the Day:  "If we citizens do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on th crude altar of reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams" ~ Yann Martel  "If you paddle away, you kno we'll find you back in this vesicle colony of mute vernacular, no dramatic means of fencing against this solitary sickness, as it precipitates flare gun shots. Coughing into the armpit of a mecharest home - because when it rains, you know it pours" ~ The Mongrel Tarants  "He who joyfully marches to the music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice. This disgrace to civilisation should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder." ~ Albert Einstein  Woo, three long quotations today, that's cool.  Oh, 'twas my Mothers birthday yesterday and the anniversary of Hiroshima deathday, which both happened 59 years ago. Happy birthday and deathday Mum and Hiroshima people! And to think Gen. MacArthur wanted to nuke China for supporting the Vietcong.
