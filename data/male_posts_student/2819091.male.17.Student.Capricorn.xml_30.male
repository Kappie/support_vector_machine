She was the greatest girl I've ever met.  Damn, if only I took a chance. If only I was brave enough, To ask her, if she would, If she would go out with me.  Damn it! If only.  Now I have to move on, She is gone and I'm still here. If only I was the one that was gone, If only I was the one that left. I hated how fate drew us away. I hated how she never told me about this.  I must move on and forget about her. She left and I could never bring her back. All I could do is remember her And finally... Forget. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My writings are nothing compared to you, My skills are dwarfed by how great your writings are. Great... What an understatement. I could not fully express how powerful your writings are. Yet I try with my best efforts to express it. I could never be like you, But I ask myself, Why do I even try? Even with my persistence, I could never write as great as you. I could never be in the same caliber as you. Yet I still try... I must be the biggest fool in the world, Always trying, always reaching... For goals a fool could never reach. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What's it like to be you? What's it like to be as great as you? I'm but a fool that is low in rank compared to you. I'm only a lowly rank among leaders and generals. I'm nothing compared to you. That's why I ask you, What's it like to be you?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dear world, I now have nothing in this world worth living for. Nothing worth marvelling about, Nothing more amazing and wonderful As her.  She has left to another place, She and her family moved away. Leaving me alone here, Without even telling me that she did so.  I keep on thinking why she did that? Am I really as ugly as what people think I am? If that is so, why did she stand by me? Did I constantly annoy her about many things? If that is so, why did she continue listening? I don't know anymore...  I don't know what to do. She was my light, in this world of darkness, she guided me. She was my friend, who gave me love when no one else did. She was my muse, always inspiring me to become a better person. Now that she is gone, what else could I do in this world but live?  That's a laugh...  What do I have to live for? I live in my own world, where I mostly imagine myself away from the harsh realities. Away from the masses of people hasting to become mature adults, Away from the people's cruelty towards anyone around them. Away to my sanctuary, my haven, my refuge. Away to my fantasies. Away...   My friend, now that you are gone...  I don't know what to do anymore.
