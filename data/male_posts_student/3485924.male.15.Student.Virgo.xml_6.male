As usual, my life has been very how you say... good.  See, not only did I have lots of fun yesterday, but I had lots of fun today.  Actually, yesterday was really good (probably because I was too lazy to get up to run -_-;), and that was before I went to sleep over at Charlie's house.    Yeah, well, yesterday started off with the not going to run.  I was dead tired (I don't really know why, I didn't do anything tiring the day before) and I just turned off my alarm and kept sleeping.  So, I got up about an hour and a half later than I would have if I went running.  I instantly went to play FFX and played for a good bit.  I actually got to right before Yunalesca (I beat her today ^_^).  Yep, pretty soon it'll be time to overlevel like crazy in the Omega Ruins and then go kill Sin in three hits.    So, the day passed by and I was happy.  Then, around 1:30, the doorbel rang.  I went to get it, and there on the steps was a package containing what I obviously guessed was Gladius (run-on sentence or something? whatever...).  Well, I WAS gonna play it right then and there, but I didn't.  I decided that I'd rather do something more productive, like actually continuing the game that I currently was playing (FFX :P).  So, I did that.    GAH!  Why won't anybody I ask buy me a gerbil for my b-day?  It's not like it's that hard ^_^    Ok, after that Charlie had invited me to go to his house, so I went and brought along Gladius with me.  I got there and we did some crap (wow, aren't I descriptive) and then went to play Gladius (Muahahahahahaha!).  We played for about 4 hours that night.  This morning we played for another 4 ^_^.  Fun game ain't it?    Again, I didn't run this morning.  Probably because we went to bed at 2 and I was tired like... real tired...  Heh, then my mom calls me at 8 in the morning to tell me some stuff.  I was half asleep, so I don't really remember what she said >.>;;  We still did get to do some excercise, though.  It took a while, but we finally got to go out and ride our bikes all around Ashburn.  Then when we came back I decided to go home.  There, I quickly (not really) beat the crap out of Yunalesca and from there on it's pretty much now.  There on= dad getting home and me helping him take out lots of stone slabs from the back of his car into the garage ^^;    Ok, that's it.  So, besides the quick delivery of a new game and the strategy guide that's supposed to get here tomorrow, nothing has really happened (of course there's also all that other stuff that you just read about, but that's just details ^^).  Well, I'm out.  I'll see you all later.  Have fun, and stay gerbil!    ('.')
