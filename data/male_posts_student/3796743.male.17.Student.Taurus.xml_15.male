And well when we got done with that we realized that we still had like a 2 hour drive ahead of us and that we'd never make it without a stop for food shopping and coffee. So what does John and his mom do you might ask? We quickly located Vancouver, Washington (we have like strange intuition for locating shopping malls which include coffee and food and GAP STORES!). So we found it and were starved, after a quick bite to eat at TGI Friday's haven't been there in like 2 months! we headed over to the mall. Where I located the GAP store and bought pants. I needed them, I SWEAR I NEEDED THEM!!! After that we found the Starbucks, and supplied ourselves with some much needed caffiene. Then back to the road! After that I got home ate some food and headed off to Capital High to go see Jane Eyre. A Capital Playhouse production, it was okay. Like it was a good show, but I wasn't impressed. Not to mention it was longer than a XXXXL t-shirt. So after that, AG and I headed over to Red Robin at midnight. I am still mad at Emmy for ditching us...but she'll pay later. Anyways...got home slept ... that was my yesterday. So today...I got up at noon and got dressed by three...does that tell you anything...how about....I DID NOTHING TODAY!I did find time to clean my room, get my car washed, and help my dad do this crap. I also somehow made my sisters computer work. Wow...look at all of those accomplishments. Now I'm going to go watch TV, feel sorry for myself and eat an entire pint of Ben  Jerry's Ice cream...yay! I really should consider convincing the world that I'm clinically depressed  chemically dependant. Now I'm gonna jet. Adios.
