Heidi and her kids did not make it, but i got to meet Enid and Basil, my neice and nephew whom i had never met, and my sister(half-sister)Dede whom i hadn't seen in fifteen or sixteen years. It was very nice, did not get enough time to talk to dede, but we exchanged e-mail adressses, so i think we will stay in contact.  Sunday i went to brunch with Josh, whom i still have a crush on. I do think he is attractive, yes, but he is really just a cool guy, and interesting to talk to . He can make me laugh. After that went home and worked on a paper that was due today, francesca came over, i finished my paper and cleaned a bit while she studied, than we went to pandora's and read for a little bit. today: turned in my paper, work is super busy, will be writing another paper tonight. cheers
