The mello virus from last year (at one point during a rehearsal, we had exactly ONE mello on the feild, instead of our five, because of various inguries or sicknessess) has returned, and now it's spread to the rest of the hornline, and the rest of the corps. (corpse? hmmmmm)  Justin, our top bass, has tendonitis in his "good" knee....the other leg still troubles him from when he broke it pre-season. Nettie, one of our second/lower lead trumpets, rode her bike into a truck and broke her collarbone.  Anthony, one of our 3rd baris, was showing off jazz running in the street, and broke 2 toes. Bye bye backwards stride! Christina, a second bari, was in a car crash, and missed a few rehearsals cuz she has such bad whiplash, she couldn't move. Allan, a 2nd mello, fell and messed up his knee, occasionally he has to sit out of rehearsals Jeff, a lead trumpet, has perpetual shin splints Meghan, mello section leader, is still wearing a brace on her ankle from when she came down with the mello virus last year Nikki, a guard member, cracked her skull open with a sabre, and was on the feild a few hours later for the run through, despite the blood still oozing from her head.  and finally...  Sarah, another one of our guard members, was jumped, and beat up with a 2x4. She was at rehearsal the next day in braces....  And yet they'll all be on tour with us next week, when we leave at 6 in the morning for our 3 week tour towards DCI Finals in Denver. Limping, bruised...we'll be there, and put on one hell of a show.
