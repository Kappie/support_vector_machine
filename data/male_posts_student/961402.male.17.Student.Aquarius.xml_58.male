Step one: Turn on water, full blast. Step two: Jump into water, get entire body wet as quickly as possible. Breathe heavily. Step three: Turn off water. Step four: Apply soap and shampoo. Step five: Turn on water full blast again and jump back in, rinsing off everything.  Anyway, I survived and was rewarded with breakfast, by which I mean COFFEE. Good stuff. No rest for the weary, though: We soon backed up and boarded our beloved bus to travel to a city to buy various stuffs (water and sportsdrinks for me, a bunch of water for everyone, and Laura got this neat candy type dealy). Then we walked over to this little town square where school children were performing dances and instrumental music and singing and other happy things. Was the happy. We sat around for about an hour before returning to the bus where we were issued really nifty little rice candy thingys. I pocketed mine, promising myself that it would be a reward for finishing the infamous hike to the rainforest station, which we were informed was "not up all the way. It's down all the way and then up all the way." Yikes.  So we board the bus again and set of for a few hours until we get to this little town next to the mountain with a restaurant dealy. The only thing I remember was the hot peppers, which I ate and pretended to not be bothered by while I downed a full glass of water and another of juice to cool my mouth off. Then we returned to the bus for a short trip to the beginning of the trail. Our big luggage was thrown into a truck, which would go ahead of us while we hiked with our backpacks.  The hike actually went pretty well. The scenery was beautiful (understatement): expansive stretches of green in every direction, majestic cascades of rock rising out of the earth, mountains that vanished into the clouds, waterfalls we could walk across, and an assortment of brightly-colored wildlife. The weather wasn't too hot or windy or humid, and the trail got more interesting as we went down (and up) it. I think I owe my dad's side of the family some thnaks for the centuries of evolution that went into producing good uphill-hiking genes. Yay!  Near the end of the hike we got our first real taste of Costa Rican Rain. It's kinda like Costa Rican driving in that it's insane, unpredictable, fast, dangerous, and common. But it felt good after a few hours of hiking.  Finally got to the rainforest station, 5 rooms in a little structure in the middle of a cloud forest,after one last really big hill. We unpacked into our rooms (Correll, Aubrey, Cris Conroy and me shared a room) and relaxed/dried off for a bit. Ate dinner a few hours later and then went on a night hike, where we saw crabs, bugs, frogs of various colors, and heard some monkeys. Turned in for a good night of sleep.
