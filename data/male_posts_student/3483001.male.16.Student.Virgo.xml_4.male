JESUS DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE EXCEPT FOR BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT WHY YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS. HERE MY PHILOSOPHY: THE MORE BITCHING YOU DO, THE LONLIER YOU WILL GET!  i mean you guys are the same people who go around and wear clothes  with chains on them, your mom's or sister's make-up ( cus your not manly enough to go out and buy your own), you read books on witch craft, practice spells, belive in that zodiac bullshit,and use a leaf and a rabbit's foot so "true love" will land in a hole in your back yard!   let me tell you something, asshole: you are not an individual. people have been doing what your doing for years, thousands are.so what makes you so individualistic? i mean you had to get the idea for doing all these things ( the hair, make-up, books, clothes, etc) from someone else, right? i mean the real individual is the kid who popped out of their mom's crotch wearing the make up, the clothes, and the 'tude'. i mean belive it or not... marilyn and ozzie didnt dress like that their entire life. ITS FAKE!! just like the rappers.ITS ALL FAKE!!! let it go!  you want a true individual? the kid who wear his shirts, his jeans, and his jeans. not to make a staple, not to be out there... no they do it, because, it just wouldnt look right to walk around in the nude would it? i mean the true individual is the kid who doesnt care about what other people are doing and mind's their own business. i mean what ever happend to developing relationships? going out? eating junk-food with your friends and playing video games? i'm sorry but me personally that's what i'm about. BTW it would be easy for you to say, " well arent you one of us?" simply, no i'm not. unlike you people who live on the net, i do this in my spare time, just for fun.   think about it.  THERE IS A WORLD OUTSIDE... EXPLORE IT, IT'LL DO YA SOME GOOD...heheheh
