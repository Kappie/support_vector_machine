On a good not ethough I did win 5 dollars from Vanderet because he was dumb enough to bet on  the Bucs.  I wandered downstairs late last night and ended up getting into a game of RISK (I took someones spot and it was the first time I played so I'm not as big a loser as it sounds..) We ended up just hanging out and talking about funny sexual encounters and things we can do to improve the house...  Intresting night but I ended up setting my alarm wrong so I missed my first class..  Well I'm off to shower now and head to my next class but I'll probably be back to write something else later today.  I remembered some stuff that happened that I hadn't written about..  I think it was too tramatic and I blocked it out..  Well in the famous last words of Anna Pavlova "Get my swan costume."  I'm outta here..
