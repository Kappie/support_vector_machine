Not only am I feeling like shit mentally, but now I have this damn heartburn to deal with. Rosh asked if I wanted to go with her to Edgefest today. Too bad I didn't go cuz you just  know  I'd be the life of the party right?   Grace should be back in a couple of hours and Eva wants to catch a movie later tonight. What the hell is out right now? Oh well, who cares..as long as I have my box of Sour Patch Kids I'm good to go.       I still can't believe how indifferent and uncaring some people can be. I've been thinking about this all morning. I mean, am I the only one who feels this way?..that friendships are sacred and should be treated as such? Love is another thing I don't fuck around with. I guess my problem is that I tend to open my heart up too damn much while expecting others to do the same. Yea I'm kooky like that.      Oh and get this, the bill for my ambulance ride to the ER came in the mail today. Three hundred fucking dollars. The sorry thing is that it's nothing compared to what the bill for my stay at Green Oaks and Medical City will be. Thank goodness for health insurance right?       Fuck I've washed my hands three times but I'm still smelling the coconut curry. Dammit.
