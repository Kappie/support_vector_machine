What do people do this late at night. I usally go to bed bout 4. The other night Collins, Dustin, and Robbie spent the night and we didnt sleep. LOL. We were up at 6:30 eating oreos and chips lol. It was fun and we had a blast. At 6 in the morn we were standing in the road with ninja masks on and try to hitchike, one lady actually stopped. Then me and robbie have been hooked on the GLEN, GLEN GLEN GLEN song from the starbucks commericial. So when Macis dad came out around 8, we were screaming GREG, GREG GREG GREG. He said shut up you stupid kids, go back to bed. So then we played some basketball. It was fun im out. I will update before I sleep
