When everything's just right, it always turns to dirt.  Help me, what am I doing wrong? I don't understand, I'm there when your not strong. I try to be happy most of the time, but it's getting harder now, knowing your friendship isn't mine.     My Friend   by Nokia  I feel like I've known you forever Although I only met you sometime this past year But our friendship will remain forever No matter what shall cross our paths and hearts  The best thing that's happened to me Is finding a forever friend like you You're there to listen, help, and talk to And best of all, I know I can confide in you  Some say the best love is one sprung from friendship So I feel this is why we should try Time leads us in this direction Should we follow on down the line?  Friendship and love are always intertwined Too close which sometimes causes confusion But if we don't try, we will never know if it was meant to be But forever you will remain my friend  I don't know if this is going to work I'm not totally sure we should try But I have all these mixed feelings Bottled up inside  I love you both inside and out as my best friend And I know that you love me that way too So when I say "best friends forever" That even means when I'm saying" Goodbye, I love you, too."     Left alone in the past   by Brande  Left alone in the past Forgotten friendships buried, never meant to last She walked away from me Why couldn't I foresee? Time standing still Another way to deal, another pill The sky is gray with hate One thing tore us apart, your fate Now what will you do? Who will confide in you? Remember the times we shared? Remember how well we paired? The consequences are tough You only knew how to treat me rough Who is next in line? Will you, too, break their spine? Look at what you've done This time I will stand in front of you, I won't run Don't bother me anymore All you touch, you tore What you wanted, you took Now I glance back, I take one last look You left me alone in your past Forgotten friendships buried, never meant to last
