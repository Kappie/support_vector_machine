Lighten up Hoshi-chan... ^^;;... you could consider the situation funny...^^;; ooo... take a look at this:  urlLink "Boo's Blog"..LOL  and  urlLink some pretty funny articles    Anyhows, I won't be on messenger on that often... at least not until I finish everything I need to finish... which...might...take... awhile... but meh! I'll be with you guys in spirit! Hopefully... if I disappear for like a month or two... you guys won't forget me...^^;; then again... it might be hard to get rid of me... I'll still go on messenger sometimes (Keane... if I'm on often... punch me... *GLARES* you seemed to have fun doing that today)    ~Chronos
