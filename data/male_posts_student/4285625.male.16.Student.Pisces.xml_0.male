GRRRR -charges up- oh andrea is making me mad she dissed on my DBZ which I dont care about because its a gay show I just wear some of the shirts.  Um yeah Amanda and Joey look good together, but one thing JOey is mine A MAN DUH!!!!.  Yeah havn't talk to Frankee she probably wont even look at me -laughs- yeah dont care I'm not a dramitical person and I dont push ppl to do things they dont want to do.   lets see wat did I do I sat in my hosue Bj came over and he left me and richard came back from wallmart.  Um I thought about becca lol, then I was like hmm so I got in my car drove to pick up Jerry *tight kid Lj's lil bro* then I went to the field show thing which looked kind of um "gay".  Saw Summer didn't care thou saw john didn't care...me and jerry chilled with some girls and Will, we then the girls started righting the bull dog which got me very happy and then they all started walking on the roof of the school (dumb freshmen)...yeah I gave summer a letter since she wrote me one and yeah I guess I'm suppose to right one back riight.  Yeah then went to Lj's house chilled with him, andrea, and jerry then andrea a.k.a ajax left then me and lj talked about some stuff.  we talked about why I wont ask summer out, about wat I'm going to do after high school, wat am I going to do this year, wat are my plans, ppl, sex before marriage which I tink your a fool if you wait until marriage to have sex if you like the person and I dont mean like u have to have strong feelings for that person...so its almost like u are on the line of love, but it may not be love yet since u may be confused then do it I say....dont tell ryan or Bj they are gay christian ppl so am I, but some rules are ment to be broken...                                                                             Well that is all Boo just for You
