Why?  1) Beyonce is the lead actress in it. 2) The gospel songs were nice. 3) Beyonce's song was featured in the movie. With just those 3 reasons, I would have rated it 99/100 if I'm being bias.   ~ Anyway, it's already Wednesday and finally, I've made up my mind of the songs I will sing for my audition. The songs are: 1) My Love by Westlife 2) Belaian Jiwa by Innuendo 3) Leng Feng Guo Qing by 5566 Sigh. I'm not sure whether I chose the right songs or not. ~.~  By the way, Harry Potter opens tomorrow. Nothing to cheer about though. Haha...     Avril Lavigne's new album rocks. I give it a 6.5/10. She is more mature and no more a young skater girl.     Don't fight temptations. Support by buying the original!
