This came up when a certain president passed away this week, and being the free market capitalist, he is breeding a new form of "Reaganomics" by the sale of crappy memorabilia."   "This T-shirt is all black and has text in white lettering that reads "mourning in america"...A formal mourning shirt!? c'mon!...This next t-shirt shows the passed away president and the words "The Original American" Idol surrond him.  This is true though, he was indeed a true American Idol by floating along on charm, triumphing with style over substance and idiots all across america seemed to keep voting for him!"  "Other Merchandise includes: hats, mouse pads, coffee cups, oil paintings for 600 dollars, and of course the Reagan bobble head.  Ah yes, remember our old president and fling his head when you are bored!"  "Don't worry I saved the best for last.  A Reagan support group is pushing to put Reagon on the 10 dollar bill, here is their spokesperson on a news show:  Spokesperson- 'Alexander Hamilton has gotten a long period of respect and recognition and was indeed very good at his work, but we think it is time to move on.  Also, Alexander is the only person on our currency that has not been a president.'  (Lewis Black)- The only person on all our currency that isnt a president, are you sure?? I bet you a hundred dollars you are wrong! (100 dollar bill shows up on screen featuring of course Ben Franklin who was never a president)  Idiots!"  Lewis Black is a funny guy.  I like when he shows up on the Daily Show.
