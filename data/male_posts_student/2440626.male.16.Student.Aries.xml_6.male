I was just like "whoa", but in a speechless sorta way.  I previously stated you can, in fact, judge a book by its cover; well today I learned that sometimes you can't.  Someone said it best: "Expect the unexpected".  ::Sigh:: I still can't believe it!  People, c'mon....I guess it is futile.  I guess I can only save the world one person at a time; I better get started.  Over and out.
