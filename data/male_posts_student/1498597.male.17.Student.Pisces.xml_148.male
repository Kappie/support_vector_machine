I'm not really sure, and since you can't give me an answer...well you're no help at all!  Well, I guess I'll just make a few announcements then.    First off, the school year is almost over!  Yeaaah!  Yeaaah!  Wow, the countdown is at five (5) business days left (there is actually seven days left if you count Saturday and Sunday).  And the countdown continues...  Secondly, I still haven't received my  yellow card  from  RCC !  I'm gettin' a little worried...Gettin' rejected for summer school!?  How sorry would that be!?  Hopefully I won't be, and I know  Nick  is countin' on me...I won't let ya down buddy!  Next, the plans for  Operation: Revolution  are still bein' finalized.  I have decided to give it a whack!  Heh, I have fuckin' nothin' to lose and everythin' to gain...Sorry, I just thought that sounded cool...Anyway, I just thought that it would be cool to try it on, and if it doesn't work, then off to the pit!    Finally, with the school year comin' to an end,  Naoki  has reminded me over and over again of how many jokes that we've all come up with and how we should compile them into a book so that they can bask in everlasting glory and never be forgotten!  So, I decided to try and rack my brains in order to put together all those dumbfuck jokes we've made.  The book will be entitled  The Big Black Book of Baffling Bullshit !  I came up with that!  Interestin' name huh?  All thanks to  Naoki  for suggestin' the idea to make the book (though we've said that we had to do it before in the years past).  I will try to work on that, but I kinda need yer guys' help in puttin' it all together!  They're your jokes as much as mine!  Well, thats it for now...More to come...!
