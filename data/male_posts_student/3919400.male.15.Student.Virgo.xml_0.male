No one objected him but he sat behind me and started to disturb me. I warned him several times but to vein. The next day, same again. I am a very short tempered guy. I tried to be calm but could not. As soon as the professor went out of the class-room, I went up to him and gave him a very hard slap on his face.   He started bleeding. He retaliated and started to scratch my face and at that very moment I gave him a second slap. Now he was bleeding really badly and he went off giving me a warning that he would beat me up with the help of seniors.   Those warnings were that, just warnings. He couldn't do anything.   I m fine but with a few scratches on my face.
