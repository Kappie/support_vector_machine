Is that enough to not keep it as a real prospect? In my view, no, I'm still keen on it, and there isn't (as far as I can find) a band called Blueshift. If there is, then there are plenty more colours. Like magenta. Magentashift.  A couple more I thought of; VIW - Very Important World Mice and Men  Love, Jon Roskilly
