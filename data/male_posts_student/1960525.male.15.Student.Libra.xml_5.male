Saturday at one-ish, Mr. Yard picked me up and we went to the rehearsal and when we got there only Jerika, Alan, and Sara were there yet, and so I was talking with Jerika and she told me that she had gone on a blind double date with Jenny, Jenny’s boyfriend, and she went with a friend of Jenny’s boyfriend, now apparently this friend that she went with looked a lot like me, and she thought that was better than if he looked like no one... I would rather not recognize the person, because if I do, then I would have an expectant set of behaviors that I would think they would do, but that’s just me... ok so we started and all the mics go set and the blue man did practicing for an eternity, well, less of an eternity and more of an hour, until they were ready, there parts were the ones that needed the most preparation.  After we did a run thought with the people that we had present, which was all but Michelle, Chreyl, and Niki, the blue men kept doing there thing until it was time to leave.  Then I went home, did some stuff that I don’t remember, then I talked to Jesse and I went over to his house so that I wouldn’t have to disturb the house when I woke up at seven.  We stayed up till midnight watching South Park, and eating pizza, and playing computer games (I leveled my character on Galaxies!w00t!) Then we went to sleep.  We woke up the next morning Jesse took a shower and I spelt till 6:30, at which point I was woken with “you need to get up now, try splashing water on your face, or rubbing acid in your eyes, that might help.”  Mr. Snider is so much cooler than my parents.  We let at seven-ish and Sara was there waiting for us, I set up the mics and the Blue Men people got make-up put on.  Were ready early so we just hung out for a while.  Once it started it was great, AJ and Sara and Jesse had there stuff down and the flying off drumstick was great, not planed but we knew what to do for it and it was awesome.  My call to worship went of well, I asked them how many of them thought I needed a hair cut (I don’t by the way) and less than half raised there hands, but my dad doesn’t accept it as a very scientific survey, he just didn’t like the answer.  The sermonettes were goo and thoughtful, I thought it went well.  In the question portion we had all the ones we expected and then some other ones that we handled well I think.  I cant really remember the ones from the first service but I’ll talk about the ones form the second one when we get there.  We had the in between wear we decided some of the things we needed to refine for the next one, then we did the next one.  It was really the same except the first was better as far as the blue man things went, the stick didn’t come off in the second service so it wasn’t as much fun.  The questions were good, someone asked us what we had to do with ours lives for us to consider them successful when we were adults, some one said that we were happy, then the point was brought up that if you completed all our goals, but some one said that Hitler completed his goals, but would we thing his life successful? Probably not, so it was interesting... then after the services were over we broke down, loaded the blue equipment, took down the mics all that stuff that needed doing, then sense I was going home with Jesse, and Jesse had a friend of his from the Blue Man Forums that came to see the service, we went out to eat and Bennigins, it was so much fun, our waitress had a distinct resemblance and sounded a lot like Drew Barrymore, it was cool.  She gave Jesse’s mom an extra side cause she wanted her to try it cause she thought it tasted so good.  When we were done with the food we were passing it across the table so she could take it and Mr. Snider took the pickle off of my plate and put it on his, when she came back later to ask if we needed any takeout boxes he asked for a one for his pickle, she brought him a full size one, it was funny.   She came to us to ask for deserts and told us we needed to try this one new thing no one was ordering and Jesse’s friend from the forums said that she would get this one thing but she couldn’t eat it all, the waitress said that little kids eat those for their birthdays, randomly Mr. Snider was like “it is her birthday” she knew we were kidding but she ended up not charging us for the dessert anyway, like I said she was cool.  She kept bugging us about getting deserts, and then I was all, well we cant see the menu so we don’t know what you have, I looked in it and ordered something other than what she was pressuring us to get and she was like, “you don’t even order what I recommend!” and I said fine I’ll have the other one and Mr. Snider said “you must be hell on a date” and we all laughed.  The dessert was really good and even thought she gave us six spoons I ate most of it myself.  After that we were leaving and she told us to go and enjoy the afternoon for her cause she was stuck inside.  We went to Jesse’s house then I biked home, and argued with Alex about the lawn and his not coming to the service (we ended up doing it yesterday, the lawn that is) and then I worked on my English project... nothing else has happened today but it still might.  Its only the end of advisory, well I need to get to class now, if anything else happens I will be included, bye.
