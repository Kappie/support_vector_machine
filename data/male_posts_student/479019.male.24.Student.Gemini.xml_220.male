It's an awesome little phone. Really light, it's got AIM, a blue back light, a neat clock screen saver thing, and more. I think it gets better reception than my Nokia 3390 too. Let's just hope I get good reception in Binghamton.  Work was a slack off day. Lots of chit chat with George, Julia, and Samantha. I also taught Samantha how to play  Minesweeper  today. My goal is to beat the advanced level of Minesweeper before I leave Nielsen. Heh... I probabably play at least 30 minutes worth of that game while at work.   I'm quite happy I have a day off tomorrow. Hopefully I'll get a chance to hang out with the posse. I could really use some pool time as I haven't hit any body of water all summer... hence my Hank Hill tan right now.  ***
