You really know that love has reached town when local supermarkets start providing for the needs of the invisible masses. It feels amazing to be a part of such a ground-breaking project as this. The next recruitment fair to be organised at Asda is specifically designed to attract a more varied application response from the community. In an effort to be at the cutting edge of Equal Opportunities policies, Asda are pushing to employ more friendly ghosts, ephemeral fairies, indiscernible toads and fictitious fiddlers.  "Never stare at the invisible, give them the eye, or exchange evils"
