After a nice back-forth email question I had with a Google staff member, the nice guy/girl decided to send off a nifty shirt! ... It's really hot, I love sporting it. :)  And the greatest accessory to go with it? An  urlLink invitation  to a  urlLink Gmail  account.. that's right-- 1 GB of quality email service.. Whoo!  On another note... It's starting to seem like my new freinds lately have been drifting away- sad. :(  Since it's summer, I feel more lonely than usual cause I don't have 2600 faces to see every day.. But- days get better... I know this holds true.  At least i got outside today...I went for a walk by myself for about an hour. But it was well worth it.  It made me feel a lot better than sitting at home on my computer...  A tip to the alienated youth: get outside. just go walk. :)  .........Nice day to you,
