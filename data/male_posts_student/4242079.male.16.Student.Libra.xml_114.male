Take a look at my last few posts...it has been quite some time since I've actually written about her. Sure, I still feel some feelings of sadness, but look, THEY'RE NOT FUCKING ON HERE, RETARD. Fools around with others eh? Yeah, so it was a mistake. It was done out of lust and anger, and I apologize to those who got hurt. So unless you're her, then it doesn't fucking concern you. And besides, I didn't sleep with her and tell her I didn't like her like that. I slept with her and told her it happened way too fast and I wasn't ready for that. Then she left and found Chad or Dom or whatever his name is. I am very happy that she's happy with him. SO SHUT THE FUCK UP IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE GOD DAMMED STORY. Yes, I was holding hands with Nikki a couple days ago. And yes, I kiss her occasionally too. So sue me for trying to move on with my life (isn't that what you want me to do, is try to move on, DUH!). She knows where I stand, and where she stands. We're being careful not to let things get out of hand before I'm ready for anything serious. So again, if you don't know the whole fucking story, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! By the way, Nobody else here seems to have a problem putting their name, regardless of what they have to say. If you're going to talk trash about me, fine, maybe I deserve it, but at least have the decency to reveal your identity. Even if it is only to me, I will keep your name off the site if you just drop me an e-mail containing your name.   in response to a previous anonymous commenter  i personaly think its sad how he sulks about his ex girlfriend and then fools around with others, telling them he likes them, then acting all confused and not forgeting about the past and not giving the other girl a chance. In fact i think its sad how he sleep with another girl, tells her he doesnt like her like that and leaves her in the dark. Starts bitching about his ex some more of how much he wants her back while a couple days ago hes holding hands with ANOTHER girl. Not his ex, nor the girl he slept with. Yeah i say hes got some issues to work on.
