I formatted the computer and instead of reinstalling Windows ME... I wanted Window 98 Plus. But that didnt work. We were baffled how we couldnt fix it. We thought we were going to have to go get it fixed and it would have cost us extra money that we dont have. So....desperate times call for desperate measures. So I woke up this morning and used the system recovery disc. It worked and I reinstalled AOL and Yahoo. I must be some kind of genius. Well Im done. BTW...HI MARIO! Heh heh. Well Im outta here. Cyaz!
