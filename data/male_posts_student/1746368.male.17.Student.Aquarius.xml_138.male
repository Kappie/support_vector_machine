Maybe I meant that that's all I am, just tired. Anyways, you can ignore my ranting at anytime.  Have a great day all; see ya.  "There was a time when people said, 'Jim, if you keep on making faces, your face will freeze like that.' Now they just say, 'Pay him!'" --Jim Carrey; not really a movie quote, but funny none-the-less.
