Shen An and I went to escort as many school as we can adn all i can say is that we were so tired after the whole event. Got to know some 47th intake clts and yes they were kind of a little dao at times but overall still can lor.  After the whole event we went to eat at geylang.Hmm they said that the food there was quite nice true...but kind of oily for me when i took a bowl of prawn hor fan soup then went to another stall to eat youtiao, i l'm luving it o man it's so crispy but anyway yes i am going to be busy this week and erm ya so haiz another week has gone.
