We spent a lot of time talking about $hit pies.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh agian.  I wouldn't let anyone eat any, i kept taking them and eating them first.  Yea... i don't know how it got started, but it was kinda funny.  It's nice to talk to people who are just as crazy as me, so i know i'm not alone.
