Anyway I've got cookie dough in the fridge, notes for my presentation in 7 hrs written, and some random stuff typed out for my art history paper. Not totally unproductive of a weekend! Anyway... I think I can probably merge some of the stuff from that paper into one of the papers for 602. I'll probably toss something into the short paper I have to do for 603 also.   Nothing else is really new. Civ3 is a nice way of dulling the boredom, by taking my mind away from me.   Oh yea... I formated one of my hard drives and it runs so much smoother now. OK... note to self... no more Windows updates!  **
