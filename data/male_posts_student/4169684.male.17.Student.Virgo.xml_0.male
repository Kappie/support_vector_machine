How many times have I heard that line? Yet the more and more I hear it The more and more it seems true (sadly) As the guys who are assholes seem to get the girl And the guys who cheat, always seem to be better off As they're sickening schemes seem invisible to the girls that meet them And the girls become distraught and hurt at the thought of being alone While the very few of us who are still genuinely nice (very few indeed it seems) We are left alone, while people are asking "What ever happened to the nice guys?" And we stand there without attention or even a look For even if we did speak out loud Life and fate would only screw us over once more...
