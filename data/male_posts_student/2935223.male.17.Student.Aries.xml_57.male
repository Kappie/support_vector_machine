I'm tired, it's like almost 1 AM...and i realize, that since this last summer, I've been goin' to bed earlier and earlier at sleep-overs...it sux.  I just keep gettin' more and more tired.  I don't wanna work at McD's anymore...I'm thinkin' about skipping work tomorrow just so I can get fired, and then make up sum B.S. and be happy.  It takes up too much of my time, my Japanese grades have gone to shit, and my time with friends has gone straight DOWN the pooper....DAMN YOU CORPORATE AMERICA!!!!  Thursday was really awesome...I got to go and hang out with Keli at Glen Park for a long time...not long enough though.  I wish I could have stayed there with her longer...or maybe just had sum more alone time. XP  Man, that river smelled like shit, but it was fun.... We all went down to the river and hung out*hang out? hung out? I dunno* and we got to go in the water...and I was feeling particularly stupid, so I went into the river with all my clothes and stuff, including shoes and socks.  It was pretty kool...I have no klue why I did it....I think it was some kind of plea for attention or sumthin'. ONE thing I did notice though, I was willing to almost anything for Keli...I mean, generally speaking, I don't do anything unusual anymore, but, I walked through the river just to get closer to Keli, and I dislike getting wet*usually*  Then I went in the river possibly for sum kinda plea for attention or sumthin'...I dunno. Moral of the Story??  I really like Keli.  There was sumthin' else I was gonna say, but I forgot what it was...... hm.  XS, I hate it when this happens. Peace-Out!  Spense
