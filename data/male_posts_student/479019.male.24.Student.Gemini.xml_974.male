I've come to the conclusion that waking up at 5 AM in the morning and working out results in more energy than if I wake up at 9 AM and work out after work. I also get more shit done. I actually always wake up around 6 AM, but the thoughts of drifting back into dreamland (and not facing reality) is so enticing.  In my last post I mentioned a customer at the coffee shop. I think I'll mention a few more stories as interesting people are plentiful at the coffee shop. Tourists, local artists, bums, shady characters, and beach folk - - some come in to rest after swimming in the ocean, some come in to do work on their laptops, and some practically live there.   Today there was a young lady who was obviously having a bad day. She came in looking like she was crying earlier, and asked to use the restroom. She then bought a vanilla chai and promptly spilled it in her car. She was going to pay for another one, but we made her another one for free. Peter said it was in part to make sure she doesn't have a breakdown and kill someone later. I wonder what sort of craziness that woman was going through today.  39 days until I'm back in Binghamton.   ***
