And some more web page design.....but anyways, after some entertaining manipulation of photos I decided to put my likeness on this blogspot.....Im sure you are all thrilled....anyways, its not exactly me cause I used some tool to give the pic a more artistic touch and i did the same thing with another picture.....so now i am a photoshop expert ! (not really) but its fun to mess around with all this stuff.....of course its now 6 am and i have yet to sleep...which is bad because i know i wont get any work done today cause ill be asleep during most of it....check out my pic it is to the right of the page....let me know what ya'll think..tell me which one ya'll like more....the pictures are at my picture page follow the link on the side of the page that says Atif's Picture Page or  urlLink click here.  ....I like the one of me looking down....the other one....my nose looks too big....damn genetics....i like photoshop...and why cant dinner make itself ? thats the invention i wanna see.....dinner that makes itself...all you gotta do is eat it...im gonna get my own personal chef...make me whatever i want when i want.....im hungry...
