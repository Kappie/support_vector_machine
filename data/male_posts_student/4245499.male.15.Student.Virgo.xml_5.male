You jipped me, fool! And Lan sorta, too. But its ok..... anyways... I would like to announce the official release of our new status! We are the  Mercenaries .  Statistics:  It may not look like it, but when it comes to food, these two are an even match. It may not seem like it but Lan can probably eat as much as Jimmy. And Jimmy can eat a lot. These two are a dangerous pair to have around, because I, Javier, know for a fact that their loyalties do not lye with the team but with the food that we have to constantly feed them in order for them to commit to the job. You can bet your bottom dollar that these two can get the job done! I shall explain:  Lan (A.K.A. Dr. Lan) You know why they call this motherfucker Dr. Lan? Because when you are in his range of attack, this motherfucker is like a surgeon with his teeth that can most likely take down a team of ten. He’s not very fast; however, being fast and being quick is two very different things. His fighting style is a beautiful to watch, because his masterful skills with his teeth make him seem like not only a surgeon but also a chef. Let’s just say that you’re gonna look better when you’re dead than alive. You think you see this motherfucker coming at you? Might as well say your prayers you stupid motherfucker.. because your ass is Lan-food; you along with your friends.  Jimmy (A.K.A. The Walrus) What do you think of when you hear the word walrus? Besides the obvious (you stupid motherfucker). The Walrus can be looked on as a gentle beast perhaps; but I warn you do not take this motherfucker lightly, because if you get on his bad side I can tell you that you’d be better off with Dr. Lan. His strength is incomparable (within our  clique ) and his intelligence is on par with even that of  Bill Clinton . A master of the spoken word and of the written language and armed with a massive array of persuasive skills, he would double as a major diplomatic weapon if only we could tame this wild beast! Instead he uses this unique skill as a tool to get girls. AND IT WORKS, TOO. YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKING PIMP.  CAUTION: ONLY REFER TO THESE TWO AS A LAST RESORT. KEEP SURPLUS SUPPLY OF FOOD IN STORAGE.
