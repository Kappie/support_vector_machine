Oh well, at least I didn't get in trouble for it (or haven't to this point anyway). From what I heard, we apparently won last night so there will only be the 4:00 game tomorrow unless we lose.  Went and saw  Troy  today after school -- pretty good movie, even though it did border on being a bit too long for me. Next up:  Shrek 2  sometime near the beginning of next week.  Angela claims that she's having a night swim party at her house on Saturday or Sunday (although it's most likely Sunday) for "all of us" -- I assume this means our U.S. History class. She said that she would call me with the time, so I guess I'll see if she actually meant it or not sometime tomorrow.
