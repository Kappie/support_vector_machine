If only I knew how to make things the way I see them in my head.  I know it's a reality yet it seems so far away.  Not to worry though, everything should be alright.  I figured I'd be really happy that my video card is here, but it's only out of its package, and I havent even opened the VGA Silencer.  I just wish things were easier.  I look at one thing or think about it and it's so positive, then I see another and things go downhill.  I'm really not a sad person, that's why I'm worried.  Something has changed, hopefully for the better.  I think tomorrow will be better, but only if things go my way.
