I feel slightly stressed out, and at points, flooded ^^;; demo, I feel ok now, even though I still have 2 units left to do. 1 math and 1 english... they should go fairly quickly.    Um... I hope that everyone isn't freaking out, considering suicide, deeply depressed, highly stressed out, or anything... that seems to be happening a lot around the school.    Anyway, people should try not to be discouraged... some people just give up working. They really shouldn't... fight to the end!! ^^ I hate giving up. Not only does it produce less results than I would if I succeed, it also damages my self-confidence: how come I wasn't able to succeed? Am I not strong enough? Do I lack the skillz? That's why... I stay up late to do work. I do  not  want to fail at this attempt to pass. I want to be able to succeed... to know that I can do this.   Whoa... I think I'm sounding really repetitive, but meh. Remember people... you are  invictus  unless you decide otherwise.    ~Chronos
