Who doesn't know if he left or not.  As fate would conspire against me the first time today (this blog being the last, hopefully) Derek had driven to and left TJ in the few minutes I was inside the school. Blast it!  So my mom took me into work.  And I worked 7 hours, yey.  I just despise the scent of decaying flesh... bird flesh.  Its no different from any other type of chordate flesh, but meh.  God taco bell zesty chicken bowls are soooo awesome and filling.  God invoices are so lame.  God Alex Apostol is so dumb (zing!).  Then at 7 ( an hour after I got home) Boucher offers to take me to the Movies.  Which?  King Arthur!  Yay!  Romans and Latin! Good shit.  I saw Taylor Scott too, after leaving the film.  And going back down broadway, this hot sophomore (now)  chick named Halay.   Mmmm I would so hit it.    Anyway, She was in the car on our right, and I said "Yeah, guys, I'm gonna get her number".  And then they looked at her and said "The blonde?  Yeah she's hot, go for it."  And Eric gave me a pen. And then her car turns away.  Damn you fate!!  Ok, end post before it goes sour.  wait, wait, Fridge Full of Jizz and the Cankles.  There we go.
