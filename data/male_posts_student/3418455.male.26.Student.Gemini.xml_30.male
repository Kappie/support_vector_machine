Well we were always dating someone at different times while the other was single.  Mostly she was constantly getting engaged to different guys and I was with this beast.  Well one night when she broke up with her b/f she came over and chilled with one of my other roommates.  Well they ended up getting together a couple of times...all the while I was right on the other side of the wall without any beast!!!      Well we talked a few weeks later about it all, she had already gotten engaged to someone else, and she said she thought I was still with the Amazon and that's why she didn't call me!  For years we were always "talking" about it but there was the chance and poof!      I regret not cheating on the Amazon when I could have b/c she did it to me, but unfortunately I am not like that.  Now I don't believe in that crap anymore....it's too much trouble.        So the moral is "When temptation tempts....give in for you'll probably never get the chance to do it again, plus there will be time to 'repent'".
