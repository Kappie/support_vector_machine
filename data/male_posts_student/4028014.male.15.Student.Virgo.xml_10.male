Well... Can't believe it... Syamimi and i had wasted almost 2 hours thinking and discussing the name for the blog... We really had a good laugh and fun though...   Hmm... The National Day Parade this year is really very plain... Nothing special... Everything were sort of boring except the fireworks, the community singing and the parade it self... I love the parade... Seeing all those contingents marching uniformly and looking proud, it really makes me kind of wanting to join them...   Well, next is the Singapore Idol... Oh man... I really have lots of comments about it... Gee... I kind of think that Singaporeans' skin are made of elephant skin... Compare to American Idol, our standrad were really very low... I mean those people who got rejected form America Idol, they at least have some standard. But as for those people who got rejected, they were really bad... Now here comes this Ricky, the Shang Hai guy who came to Singapore and sing... Wow... That's really a surprise to me... He can sing well, but only suits in opera, not hip hop... His pitch is way to high up... I believe it will never go down... Next is the stripist... That guy was damn gross... Really... I mean if he have the build, showing it is ok... But he don't! Oh man... I was eating and i nearly choke when i when i saw him striping... Yew... Its damn gross... Then that guy who sang the lemon tree... Well, that guy i really no comment... Speechless... Well... Wednessday we've another episode of Singapore... Haha... Preparing to have a good laugh... Yes...  Well... That's all for today... Take care people... Tomorrow got to go back to school...
