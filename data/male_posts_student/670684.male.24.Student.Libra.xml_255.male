Water bottles, sports equipment, wallets, crucifixes (or crucifii? the word is Latin) retainers, and especially keys.  At Wake, at least a dozen kids lost their keys at some point during the camp's tenure.  Here the number is less, but the stakes are higher.  During a round of Ultimate Frisbee on the quad yesterday, John announced his key was missing, causing us to start a search line and walk at arms length across the field, scowering the grass for any semblance of a shiny object.  Somehow we found it after 20 minutes.    The goal of this institute is for every student to leave here with a plan of action that they will impliment at their school/in their community in order to help alleviate a dilemma/solve a problem/promote service and involvement.  Lisa is working on eating disorder awareness.  I haven't thought about eating disorders in a long time, probably since I was a junior at Centenary...eating disorders seem to hover primarily in the adolescent age bracket, with a few stetching into post-adolescence early adulthood (I believe that to be a wonderful term).  In high school, we were constantly bombarded with Ad Council posters and awareness videos about eating disorders, including a Coach Gooch video that can only be placed as odd - a girl who collects her post-bulimia discard, holding it in jelly jars in her closet.    I've dated two girls with eating disorders.  Quite possibly more, but I can only think of two who I was close enough to so I could notice and try to help.  One is recovering, the other I believe is still anorexic, and won't admit to herself that she has a problem.   I've dated three girls who wanted to rebel against their strict fundamentalist backgrounds, and two others whose ideas on sexual encounters came straight from John Calvin, with addenda to allow for dry humping.  Another girl was abused by her mother, and another abused by her father.    I don't post this to show my limited reading audience  Look at this! .  I don't know why I post it.  Maybe because  Call It Sleep  is such a wonderfully depressing book, so full of questions, so full of childish wonder, and so full of misaligned jackass characters.  I am not sure if this book inspires me to write, or denies me my most true story.  The father in  Call It Sleep  is a bellicose tryant, abusive in a physical realm, yet drawn whole-heartedly to his wife in a maternal aspect...his jealousy of his son's interaction with the woman comes because he does not get that attention from her anymore.  It is a perfect representation of my father, subtracting the physical abusiveness and incorporating more lucid quips and sarcastic banter.    I often forget that my father is a first generation American, and his father was born in Norway and grew up in immigrant slums in Minnesota and harbortown Los Angeles.  The evidence to tie the Albert in  Call It Sleep  to the Albert my dad's father and the Albert my father is anecdotal and fanciful...I never met my dad's father, so I don't know the relationship my dad had with him.  All I know is a 19th Century Europe that exists in my imagination and nowhere else, a simulacrum of my thoughts and dreams.
