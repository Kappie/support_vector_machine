To start with she didn't believe me, and then we got talking about it and I was explaining my applying technique. I think my sister noticed this morning at the bus stop. She goes, what have you got on your face, I said stuff, trying to avoid saying foundation in front of the others. Then as we walked over to where the bus stops she said you need to rub it in a little more under your eyebrows. So, I think she knew, just didn't want to embarrise me, which was nice of her. I hopeing my mum will notice, or tori tells her, cause then she'll confront me about it and it'll be the perfect oppertunity for me to ask if she can buy me my own bottle thing. I really did look fantastic today, along with my new found like for foundation, I was wearing my pinstripe trousers and my white 'Guide London' top. I felt really good about myself, I think making yourself my physicaly attractive can also affect your mental state of mind. I especialy liked the fact that Amy said I did a good job of it. Lloyd and gemma seem to be getting on really well at the moment which annoys me. I want to move on but my past is clinging on. Usually in science lloyd goes on the computer, but today he stuck with me and the girls, infact he actually sat in my place, but I still got in there by sitting next to gemma but where the cuboards are, so it was a little uncomfortable. Laura B said hello fagot boy at the start of the lesson, which I should find offensive but I didn't, I just said Hello back, as if to say, I'm not going to argue with the truth. Later on she said I was sweet, which made me feel really great. I think Laura might want me to be her GBF, and I would love to do the honour. Perhaps I should leave gemma to lloyd and choose laura insted, she's just as cool. I've been so so so tired these last few days and it's really pissing me off. I try to go to bed early, 10:00, but I ended up not going to sleep until like 12:00. I want to see if we have any sleeping tablets cause I'm in dire need of a decent nights sleep. My eyes are aking so much, I was strugleing to keep them open all day. Graphics this morning was pretty good. Although the stuff were doing (revision) is terribly boring, I'm now sitting with Heather and Rachel, and I love sitting with the ladies, it just makes me feel so much more comfortable.
