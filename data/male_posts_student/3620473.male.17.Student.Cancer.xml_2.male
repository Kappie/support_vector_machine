Like I said, was just something about it and hearing you say it will all be alright and such, guess it was just what I needed to hear. I just cant stop thinking about how great you are and how much I miss you. I'm not worrying about a damned thing any more, other than the little time that you will still be apart from me and here. But that will end soon. Its been the first of the last days without you. After today, there is not another saturday without you. The next one you will be here :) I'm borderline giddy excited I am in such a good mood. God I love you. *MWAH* Oh and about that, I don't want a makeout session whenever you get back, hell I could go without a single kiss. Just as long as I get to see you and maybe one lil hug, I will be more than fine. So don't you go worrying about that or anything else. Like you said to me, just be you, cause thats the person I love, you.  *mwah*
