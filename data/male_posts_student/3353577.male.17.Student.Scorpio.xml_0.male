While so many of my friends are busy buying cars and trying to move out, I am juggling school and a dead end job to save up enough money to go overseas. At the end of 2003 I made a decision to spend 2005, the year after I finish high school, going on a holiday around the world.   I spent a few nights on the internet looking for a good ‘round the world’ flight package for me. Although the Star Alliance seemed to have some cheap deals, they didn’t cater for all of the places I wanted to go. Then I came across the One World 5 Continents offer. It is so good it’s a joke. On their web page they have a few sample itineraries for travelers, and they involve going to about 8 places for AUD$3300. Through some reading of the rules applicable to the ticket, I found that I could travel to 20 places in five continents of my choosing for the same price. Considering that nowadays it can cost AUD$2000 for a ticket to the United States, it’s incredible that for just over a grand more you can go to 19 other cities.   When I took my itinerary to the local Flight Centre, they were stunned by the amount of places I had written down. They mentioned to me several times that it was the largest trip that they had ever handled, and that my journey was a ‘travel agent’s dream’. They also gave me loads of good advice on traveling safe and healthy in third world places.   As I am only 17, and unsure of whether my family (who are very supportive) will help me out financially on this trip, I concluded that it was time to get a good job and start putting in long hours.   I applied to a furniture factory who was offering jobs in the newspaper. After a quick interview, I was part of the team. Not counting the sawdust that causes cancer, the time a wheel broke and a 2m high trolley came crashing down on me, several other health and safety violations and an hourly wage of AUD$8.65, I enjoy the job because they give me hours when I need them and the people there are nice.   The main way I save money is by trying not to go out on Friday and Saturday night much. I only go to parties when they are important and I know who will be there, and when I don’t have to spend money on transportation. Before I had to save money, I used to go to any parties just to fill up my weekend because I had more fun going out than staying at home. I made myself stop doing this and now I actually rarely go to parties unless they one of my close friends is holding one.   As I still live with my parents, I find that many weeks I will spend absolutely nothing and the money will go straight into the bank untouched. I actually lost my wallet a while ago and I think it helped me save about AUD$300 because I couldn’t touch my money until another bankcard came.   The reality is, if I can save for a trip like this, than any other kid that doesn’t have any living expenses could do it also. Going on holidays for about 300 days and seeing a large quantity of the world in that time may seem reserved only for the ultra-rich, but it is actually is an obtainable goal if you are willing to put in the hard hours for it. Right now, I have AUD$1500 in the bank, all of which I have saved this year, and when school finishes I will be making AUD$400 a week. I figure that I will be able to save up at least AUD$5000 dollars this year and then earn more money in L.A., because my grandfather owns a furniture factory which I can work in.
