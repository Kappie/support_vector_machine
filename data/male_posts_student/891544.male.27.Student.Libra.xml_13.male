But I will keep you in suspense about those too (because I can't remember them right now, ha!)  I hope nothing happened to you in this accident that you're leaving us all in suspense about.  Wine bar tonight if you can make it out...then you can finish the story.  I'll post a time for tonight some time today when I find out or we'll just give you a call.    Hope to see everyone there tonight!  :)
