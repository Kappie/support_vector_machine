English - Hate it because there is creativity involved and i dont do that creative stuff i dont write unless i have a guideline on how to or what to write. I also hate criticism, i dont know why but i just hate it, maybe because im being single out for sucking at something. I mean in discussions i make all these good points but thats the only time when i am allowed to discuss something when its talking about characters or something im no good.  2. Business Law - She just treats us like fucking idiots, i dont know what it is about her she doesnt realize that we are grwoing teenagers and will be ourselves, she doesnt fucking realize that, im a fucking genius in that class, i can do most of the things in that class much better than anyone and my average is a 102 i dont think i really care much anymore, and why doesnt she do anymore bonus things for points so i can get a higher grade. 3. Gym - No real complaints except that i couldnt get a girl friend unless my life depended on it. I mean i already do two varsity sports do i really need to do gym i mean honestly maybe those idiots in our class who dont putfoth any effort but i do. 4. US History - i mean i think she expects a bit much out of us but hey shes a bitch and that brings around my next pooint, my scheudual for next year i will never be able to take all the classes i want to take, shit i gotta find a way around this to open up some slots. 5.  Chemistry - No complaints, just a it too much memorazation 6. French 3 - Damn this class i mean i want to take it next year but i dont think i will, it is hard and the teacher even though she explains it is a bit of a random character, she just does all this shit that is random. I dont know i want to get into a good college and everything but is the extra year worth verse what i can possibly take in its place. 7. Algebra 2 - Easy class not to tough comparatively speaking, and fun and bring about my oher point i cant talk to girls im just a NERD. 8. Polish - Im so stupid how can i notdo well in the class but i am and in a class of all girls and i must seem weir, well i am, but then again i am better than all them at most of this and probably did better than all of them once again. I saw my last quiz grade was a 64 and with a curve assuming grades arent that much better it will be an A.   This rave has had a secondary purpose it was to see how many words i could type, so i could see if i had potential to do nanowrite month, i wonder if i could wreite that 50,000 words, and guess what next year, a couple of days after it starts i could actually go to a writing party. Fun. Well lets see what other topics i can talk about as relating to stress, one definately could be home, track, friends, etc... i dont know i definately will post again later
