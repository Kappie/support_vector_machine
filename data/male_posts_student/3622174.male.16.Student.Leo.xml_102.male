First, I drove from 8-3 with my group, and then, instead of going to Alex's house, went to the school, since neither me or Alex were really feeling all that great after that long day.  So, at the school, I saw Courtney, Melissa, and a couple other people I know.  Then I went home.  Now excuse me, I must go to sleep.  That ends this short edition of Blog of Bagel.
