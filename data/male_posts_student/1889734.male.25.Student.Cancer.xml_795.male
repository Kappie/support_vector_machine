Excerpt- "I stood on the bloody sand where Marine Second Lieutenant Therrel Childers was the first American killed on the ground.  I pointed a loaded weapon at another man for the first time in my life.  I did what I had spent 14 years training to do, and my Marines - your Marines - performed so well it still brings tears to my eyes to think about it.  I was proud of what we did then, and I am proud of it now.  Along with the violence, I saw many things that lifted my heart.  I saw thousands of Iraqis in cities like Qurnah and Medinah - men, women, children, grandparents carrying babies - running into the streets at the sight of us, the first Western army to arrive.  I saw them screaming, crying, waving, cheering.  They ran from their homes at the sound of our Humvee tires roaring in from the south, bringing bread and tea and cigarettes and photos of their children.  They chattered at us in Arabic, and we spoke to them in English, and neither understood the other.  The entire time I was in Iraq, I had one impression from the civilians I met: Thank God, finally someone has arrived with bigger men and bigger guns to be, at last, on our side."
