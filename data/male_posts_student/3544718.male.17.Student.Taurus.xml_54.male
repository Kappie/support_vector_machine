Not only that, but he's one of the very most awesome people I know... he's from Paraguay, but he's been in Brazil for a while. Many of you probably know him, and you're better off if you do! Anyways, that's Jaime in a nutshell.  Then there's Natalia... when I first met her... I thought she hated me, and she thought I hated her. It's kinda funny now that we look back... especially how close we've gotten. We are so alike, it's scary! Well, not really scary... but very cool. Like, all the things we think at the same time... and all the stuff that we both like. Anyways, it's like Natalia is another me, only a girl... or maybe I'm another Natalia, only a boy... who knows? But, if you don't know Natalia, you're missing out! (not just because she's similar to me... but because she's a good friend to have)
