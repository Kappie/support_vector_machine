I really want to call Stacey but whenever I have free time it is either late at night or I don't have time because we are about to do something....*sigh* oh well. And I would call her now but we are about to watch a DVD...."Scary Movie 3" cuz my parents never saw it lol. Oh and I wen to go see "The Day After Tomorrow"....It was good, the effects and stuff were cool but the story was kinda hmm....weak but it was still good and y'all should go see it.
