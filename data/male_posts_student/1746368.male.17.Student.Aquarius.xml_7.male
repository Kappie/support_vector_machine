If I don't seem like myself in person, I'm really sorry. I lashed out at a few of my friends by mistake (by lashing, I mean walking away without saying anything). I know that only one of them probably reads this. I am sorry to all four of them. They are pretty much my only friends at Livermore and it's really hard because none of them are going through as much as I am. My day could have gone better today. I can't imagine it going worse. The peak of my day was talking with Dominique though. She makes me feel a lot better, no matter what the case. Talk to you guys later. I will be online, but I will be more in pensive mode, than Colin mode. Please, if you want to talk online, I'm all ears, but don't try to cheer me up. The only thing right now that could cheer me up is if I forgot all about this. Since that's not going to happen, it really isn't any use.
