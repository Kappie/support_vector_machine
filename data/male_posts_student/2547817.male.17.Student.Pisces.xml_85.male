At least it mean that she sent me two messages in reply. She had a power outage too. Told her to sleep coz I knew she scars easy in the dark. I tool my bike lights and stuck 'em blinkin by the window. Just to be cheeky. When the power came back on, the neighbourhood erupted with cheers and various slogans like, "VOTE PAP". I was immensely amused.  Got into a fight at school today. Praise Jesus for being in my heart at that time, that I was able to control my actions and tongue. I didn't hit him or use the language that he used. Instead, I pondered upon Jesus and what he would have done. I gave Keith the other cheek today. I was forgiven of my trespasses as I forgave he who trespassed against me. Holier than thou? Not intentionally. Just attempting to live well. Pleasing to Him and Him prioritarily! Errr...  Have to admit, it was cool though. Falling over row after row of seats in a frenzied exchange of violent and recklessly aimed blows. Well, it wasn't really an exchange but it sounds more interesting when read with gusto.  God bless him. In fact, God bless us all.  I miss Zel. Goodnight.
