Sex Pistols , Blink-182,  Bad Religion ,  Pennywise ,  Vandals ,  Offspring ,  Social D , X, The Damned, TSOL, Adolecents, Circle Jerks, The Distillers, Unwritten Law, and GBH, A New Found Glory. They're basically all bands I would like to see. Old school to current punk bands for one show! Damn it! Damn it to hell! Take away all the enthusiasm I had for going to Binghamton. I almost want to come back just for the weekend to see that show!  I have a headache!  **
