I woke up and my ankle aches like mad, and unfortunately has me off school :(  My dad rang Mr. Swaries and it was about the reference to Mrs. Checketts being a cow in one of the earlier posts, so I removed it.  I'd just like to say (whilst all the teachers are probably reading my blog now) that anything wrote here is an opinion based on my mood at the time of post.  If I am in a bad mood of course, posts shall be quite bitchy or a bit nasty, but I don't mean to cause any harm from these posts nethertheless.
