After a week which consisted mostly of lazing around, “playing” some tennis, reading, music and other things which have no connection whatsoever to the “revision” that I was supposed to be doing, getting back to the mundane routine was almost traumatic! But anyway, I’m kinda getting used to it, so maybe after about 10 months (by which time, 12th would be done with for good (hopefully) I would’ve definitely blended in.  My dad returned from his first ever trip to the U S of A, yesterday. Owing to the fact that my relatives have equally distributed themselves in the U.S and Bangalore, I’ve heard my dad’s version of his trip, roughly about 15.5 times (yeah, by the 15.5th time I was definitely PUKKOFIED) But anyway, it was pretty interesting to hear about a foreign lifestyle and everything. From the sound of it, Americans seem to do everything in a XXL size. Apparently, they buy HUGE groceries, use extensive amounts of electricity and water and are also pretty huge themselves. Basically, they WASTE everything that they have. Some guy, after hearing that my dad was from India, asked him whether he was from some tribe or something. After a detailed explanation from my dad about how people in India aren’t mostly tribal but are actually pretty civilized and that India was in the south of Asia, NOT Africa; the guy nodded enlightenment and finally when my dad was about to leave, asked him if he could meet up with him when he was visiting Chile next month!  But other than that it seems an alright place. I saw a couple of photographs and it is almost shocking how even the trees look perfectly fresh and green. My dad had difficulty breathing for a while, since he couldn’t quite get used to the fact that the place was completely dust free! It is tragic how India is unlikely to ever reach those standards.  ARGH power cut!!! This is happening too often these days.So much for “India Shining’’!
