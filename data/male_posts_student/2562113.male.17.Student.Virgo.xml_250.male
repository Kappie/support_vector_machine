Thursday: took two final exams, said my goodbyes to everyone, packed up and drove home from albany. it took me forever to unpack and set my stuff up in my house. i was so hungry so lauren invited me over and we ate hot dogs and strawberries. after i went home and finshed unpacking and didn't fall asleep until 3:30 am. Friday: woke up at 630am and got ready to go to six flags. we had a disco, rave, and yatta in the car! six flags was so much fun.  i macked it to 13 year olds and they gave me funnel cake . and the best idea ever was the river rapids! Saturday: didn't get much sleep that night either. i went to my cousins gradutation party.. it was so funny watching a bunch of filipinos line dance to the cha cha.  that night i had a few people over. i drunk 4 beers and i was just so tired. me, nick, adam, and chris raved for a little..  alex pointed out my boner, i had no shame . i went to bed real early for a saturday night. Sunday: we played basketball and frisbee at farley. chilled at hoyers after that.. that night the A team and colleen got together for some  good laughs and good blunts . mike had one of the smuttiest stories i ever heard. the 22 yr old secretary! Monday: katie came over and we played video games and then we went to farley for some wiffle ball but there wasn't enough people so i  drunk a bottle of champagne  and we ate at fiesta. hung out at lauren's after that. Tuesday: slept till about 3pm and picked up jermaine's uncle's computer to fix. kate came over and chilled for a bit. we came to the conclusion that i am going to be  "disco bob" for halloween ! then i fixed two computers that took until 4am.  Wednesday: went hiking. me and nick mooned people. it was a lot of fun. went to pizza smut with the guys. good times.  I have a dentist appointment in 11 hours.. "we have to take out your wisdom teeth" is what i'm expecting to hear.. give me some vicatin then.. i've been lazy with job applications because of this wisdom teeth bullshit.. smutty weekend coming up.. my boy josh from college is having a triple kegger at his house friday night, can't wait for that.. and that's pretty much it.. need money.. must find job.. must work very soon..
