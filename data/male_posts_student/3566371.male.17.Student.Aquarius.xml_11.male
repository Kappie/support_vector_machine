I have not much to do, but I'm not really bored and I'm not really into doing something. Like think, but I always go think when I've nothing to do. Bad habit. Cos when I think, I useally go worry about something that's not worth worring or about something that I can't change. At the moment I'm happy with my life, but not thrilled. I don't have much to write. If I were smart, I'd be learning now. Tomorrow I have a test on Dutch. I think that's difficult. I've to learn about all the different spell/grammar/style errors you can make. I need to know the name, what it is and be able to correct them. Dutch grammar is difficult. With d's and t's everywhere. And things like 'incorrect concise bijzin (whatever that's in English)'. Pff, glad I've almost got holiday. What to relearn to play the piano. I used to play the piano. Still know all the notes, it's just I have to think too long before I know what note a note is. Have the sheet music of Hello from Evanescence. Cool song. I like Evanescence. Though they're not really my style. Thursday I might go see a film with some friends. Friday I'm going to hang with Albert. Hope that's going to work out. Not that after an hour or so he'll say he needs to do something else. That would be typically him. I hate him, but I love him, so I'll just use him until he becomes available again. Saturday I'm going to the cinema. See, if got two groups of friends. The first group consist of very good friends, too bad they are boring as hell and never do something. The second group consist of people who say they're my friends (just like I say they're my friends). They do stuff, that's cool. Too bad they are less social, backstabbing and they fix on somebody and hang with him/her and exclude the rest. They give me mixed feelings. I always think, are they my friends or not? But they are fun so I'll stick around. Sunday I've to work. That's my schedule for the next few days.
