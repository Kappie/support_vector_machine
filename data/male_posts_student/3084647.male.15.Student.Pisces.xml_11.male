Sir Stamford Raffles was bloody British, for goodness’ sake. He also must have been a person who had delusions of grandeur, for the castle was indeed very grand, though old. There was moss on some walls, which were all solid stone magically put together. In the twilight Cheryl could see the warm glow of candles in the upper towers, which housed the various common rooms and dormitories. Cheryl could already imagine her four-poster bed with the hangings and inviting feather pillows...  As she passed the Entrance Hall into the Great Hall, she noticed something was missing. The hall seemed much bigger than usual. She looked round, wondering, before it came to her suddenly – the decorations were gone. 	 At the start of the Welcome Feast there were always large House banners hanging above the House tables – orange for Griffindoor, blue for Huffelpuff, yellow for Ravingclaw and green for Slithering. They were the centre of attraction at every feast because they usually had “special effects”. For example, Griffindoor’s lion would suddenly roar, or white doves would suddenly appear out of Ravingclaw’s two crossed wands. This year, however, they were conspicuous only by their absence. 	 Cheryl nudged her friends and told them. They were not the only ones to have noticed; people from other Houses were also looking up, their faces puzzled. 	 “What happened to our banner?” Minyu wailed. “I miss it! I miss the orange!” 	 Cheryl rolled her eyes. “Bah,” she said. 	 The rest looked at her. 	 “Nothing,” she replied innocently. 	 She could tell Matt was trying extremely hard not to roll his eyes. To prevent herself from going into a fit of uncontrollable laughter (which was often very infectious and led to stares), she quickly sat down at the Griffindoor table, at the extreme right side of the hall. At the front of the hall she saw the teachers’ table – sitting right at the centre was Professor Smurf, the Headmaster. He was chatting to Mr. Teo on his left, who taught Charms – Mr. Teo had decided long ago to ditch tradition and let students call him “Mister”. Next to them was Professor Helmi, Cheryl’s Arithmancy teacher, who was deep in conversation with Professor Huda of the Astronomy department. Rumour had it that these two were a couple. To the Headmaster’s right was Transfiguration teacher Professor June, who was laughing very hard at a joke that Professor Tweety, the resident Herbology teacher, had just told her.  Right at the end of the table sat a very bored and lonely Professor Lulu, the History of Magic teacher. Between Professors Tweety and Lulu there was one empty seat. The seat at the extreme left of the table was also empty. 	 “And soon we’ll find out who exactly they belong to,” said Barnabas grimly.  	 Cheryl looked up, mouth open. How did he know that that was exactly what she was thinking about?  	 Barnabas looked back down at her, eyebrows raised at her expression of round-eyed surprise. “What?” he said after a pause. 	 Cheryl stared back.  	 “Bah,” she said.  ----------	  Two hours and one hell of a feast later, the Great Hall looked like a repeat of the dinner at The Wacky Wizard, except that this time, it was on a much larger scale. Most of the students were already yawning – after all, eating and talking at the same time required plenty of energy. However, Professor Smurf did not seem to notice any of the students’ lethargy – he stood up and raised his hand for silence. 	 The hall went quiet immediately. The headmaster smiled. “And so we begin another school year,” he began. “But before we begin, I must introduce our two new teachers. Please welcome Sivanesan s/o Makesan, who will be taking the Defence Against the Dark Arts post.”   At this Cheryl glanced once again at the staff table. The two empty seats were now occupied. Professor Sivanesan, a rather broodingly handsome young Indian man, had gotten to his feet and bowed, a trace of a smile on his lips.   “...and also Minellus Molekiw, who will be our new Potions master,” Professor Smurf continued. There was a smatter of applause for the two new teachers. Apparently no one was really bothered.  Cheryl took a hard look at the man called Minellus Molekiw, her new Potions teacher. She did not like his appearance at all. His skin was sallow, and his eyes glinted with a rather crazed light – rather like that of a lunatic. Moreover, there was a mole on his right cheek. It was twitching rather unpleasantly. His face was so oily it was shining in the bright lights of the Great Hall. Cheryl wondered if this man’s character was as disgusting as his appearance. 	 Professor Smurf raised his hand again, and once again the hall fell silent. “However, that is not all,” he continued. “I must also announce that Professor Molekiw will take on the post of Discipline Master in our school. Apparently the Ministry has seen it necessary to create such a post here in Hogwarts...”  	 He trailed off. Professor Molekiw was whispering something into his ear. The headmaster listened intently before giving a curt nod and sitting back down. 	 Now Professor Molekiw stood up. He cleared his throat loudly. Cheryl sighed. What on earth did he want to say? 	 “I am pleased to teach at such a prestigious school,” he began in a distinctly sour voice. “I assure you I will do my utmost best as a Potions teacher. However, I must also inform you that I hold the post of Discipline Master in this school. The post of Discipline Master is something the Minister of Magic deems necessary, given... current events.” A smile flickered and died on his lips, which were pursed into a thin line. They made him look like a horse.   “As Discipline Master I will be in charge of maintaining the discipline standards in this school and ensuring that no student goes astray due to bad behaviour. I will also make sure that the school is a conducive learning environment – my first action has been to take down all the decorations, as they will distract you from your studies. I will give you a full review of the discipline standards I expect in this school very soon. I assure you, any student who steps out of line will be punished as he or she deserves. The school will be run the way I want it. Of course, I hope that all of you will co-operate with me, so that my job will be made much easier.” 	 He sat back down, even as Professor Smurf called out, “All students to your dormitories now!”  	 Cheryl joined her friends as they walked out of the Hall and climbed the stairs to Griffindoor Tower. They all bore looks ranging from disgust to shock on their faces.  	 “He’s really an idiot, isn’t he?” Muthu said. “ The school will be run the way I want it ... he sounds like some power-crazy maniac to me.” 	 “I told you the Ministry was interfering here,” Barnabas muttered darkly. “He’s even endorsed by the Minister!” 	 “ Why  did he have to take down the decorations? The  orange  decorations!” Minyu complained.  	 “Well, just as long as he doesn’t set rules that are  too  strict,” Cheryl said. “And I think he should really do something about his face. Yucks!” She shivered, the image of Molekiw’s twitching mole still in her head. 	 “I thought what he said was okay...” Eunice said rather thoughtfully.  	 The rest gave her incredulous looks, but she didn’t notice. 	 After climbing up the five flights of stairs leading to Griffindoor tower, which was at the north end of the castle, they stood in front of a large portrait of a lady in a rich velvet evening gown. She was certainly pretty. However, she wasn’t looking at all happy, with her arms folded and her eyes trained on something far in the distance. Her stance looked rather like a certain East India Company employee’s... 	 “Hedgehog quill, Lady Raffles,” Matt said to the portrait. “A Prefect told me,” he said nonchalantly to the others gathered round.  	 Lady Raffles gave a prim nod, and the portrait swung open to reveal the warm, cosy Griffindoor common room. It was certainly a large room – there were over ten long tables in it, each accompanied by a collection of mismatched chairs – plush armchairs, wooden, hard-backed ones, and stools. On the left side of the room there were the tall windows, now wide open. On the right side was a long noticeboard. At the end of the room, right in front of the Griffindoors, were the two staircases that would lead to their dormitories.  	 The Griffindoors tumbled in, most of them yawning. Cheryl did not stop by the noticeboard to see whatever notices were there, but instead said her goodnights to her friends and ambled up to her dormitory. There she was greeted by her four-poster bed with the hangings and inviting feather pillows. 	 She could not resist.
