I don't understand why I was pretty attached to her, and sometimes I still had that kind of feeling I had back then at the Spore Changi Airport. Today, she was back in my mind again...She stayed with me throughout my chalet back then in April 04 and we had some really great time together. I still remembered that we had pillow fights in the room...We brushed teeth together...Toast mashmallows together...Those were the fondest memories I had. Whenever I am feeling down, she will always be there for me... How I wish I couldexpress toher how I feel all along...       She kept me wondering why I hadthe heart to leave her behind...Even ifthe gurl I liked ask me to stay, I won't...But if she persuade me instead, I might stay behind and let go all my dreams offurtheringmy studies...I guess that's y friendship is the most important. Without that special person in your life, you might not know how to get on with it...I guess that's y even when I had something to tell her before I left, I didn't say though...But its all in my heart...And 1 day, I will let her know how I feel...I do miss her alot........
