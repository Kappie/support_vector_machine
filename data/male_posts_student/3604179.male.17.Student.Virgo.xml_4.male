Friday - Finally did something fun, went to the dells. Stayed at a hotel, had some fun.  Saturday - Woke up having 5 hours of sleep, went mini-golfing, took 3rd out 4 people, ran out of money. Sunday - Back to Wausau, went to bourne supremacy. Good Movie, straight up great.  Softball Update - This week was the battle of the highlands... Rematch, after our great lost in 5 innings last time, we were looking for a better battle. After the first inning it was 1 to 0. Good game starting, but then... red started swinging and batted 9 runs to take a 9-1 lead going into the 6th inning. We hadn't hit all day, but finally we hit a little. 3 runs came in and the game was 9-4. We then shut the team down and went into the 7th down by 5, our team hit and hit and got it to 9-8. Our best hitter came up and popped up, it was barely caught, and the game was over. A good comeback, but coming up short. I was 0-2 with a walk. My average dropped to .500 so I guess it's not too bad yet. Oh well, a close game is better than a whooping. Better luck next week. My Indiana trip starts on thursday, I'll tell ya all about it later.
