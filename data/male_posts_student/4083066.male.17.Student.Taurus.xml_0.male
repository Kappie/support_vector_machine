I got home and got ready cause Hilary was pickin me up and we went to see the Village. I love your hair Hilary! it looks real good on you ;-) lol. Well, the movie started at 10:05 and I was taken a shower at 9:50! hahahaha, so i was running a lil late and to make it worst, I LOST MY WALLET! Then she took me in her sweet ass car and met some other friends at Regal *Erin, Ben, John (i think that was his name) and some other chick but i forgot her name)* The movie was alright and Hilary... i only jumped because YOU made me jump :-) lol. well that was a good night. Then i came home and my brother was talkin to Wendy. Oh by the way, Wendy, you made me late for work by 30 minutes! You wouldnt let me git off the phone til 3 in the darn mornin!!! thanks man lol. Its 5:20 p.m now so im gonna go find somethin to do. see ya
