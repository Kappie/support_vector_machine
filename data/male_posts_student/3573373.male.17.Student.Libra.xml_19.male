"professional assassin, for hire." "of course. for hire, i like that. yes, i think you'll fit in quite nicely with our little... operation." "i see." "yes, are you familiar with our protocol?" "i understand that you are airtight... that the authorities have been trying to penetrate your outfit for a long time... quite unsuccessfully." "quite." "it helps to own half of the cities elected officials. it cuts down on the amount of, shall we say, attention, that is paid to you from the law enforcement." "i see." "yes, in fact, we have never been on the wrong side of a trial verdict. do you think that is a coincidence?" "i suspect not." "then you are correct. no, loyalty is demanded of all of our... 'employees' above all else. failure to conduct yourself accordingly..." "yes, i understand most fully. loyalty above all else." "excellent. i see we have reached an agreement then?" "yes, your offer was most generous." "...and there is more where that came from. you see, our people, provided they are efficient, are treated very, very well." "i see."  ha. loyal assassins are indeed the future, and i aim to prove it...
