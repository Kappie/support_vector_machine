At lunch Tim's table was throwing around a burrito wrapped up in a plastic bag. Someone threw it at Tim and it opened up! The meat and everything got all over his jersey! That jersey is expensive because I have the same kind but a different team. He got it all off but there was a huge stain. I was happy because Mr. Moser didn't give us assigned seats or anything so I can still sit next to Thomas and Stacey. Then when I got home I watched the Yankees get killed by the Red Sox while I talked too Stacey on the phone. Oh and on Thursday, we were talking about blowjobs or something on the phone and she was like "I will make you screa......oh, hi mom." I was like OMG what perfect timing lol. That was hilarious!
