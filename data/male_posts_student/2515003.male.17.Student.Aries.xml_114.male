In case anybody is using the current IP to connect to the website, you will require to update your records, or just be smart and use the domain name.  However, no other significant changes will be made. Karan will still be able to leave the current settings for Blogger (i.e. FTP).  An important change however is how email will be handled on the exunclan.com domain. Most exun members are entitled to getting an email address, and can request the names they would like. There is obviously a limit on how many users the system can accomodate, hopefully everybody gets atleast one address.  In an ongoing effort to make Exun members more net savvy (woah!), most of you (if not everyone) will be able to get a personal URL in case you need.  I haven't decided what it'll be, but I'm likely to attend the meeting on the 7th of July to discuss some possibilities.  Just a thought :  urlLink http://members.exunclan.com/~username   Anyhow, Cheers.
