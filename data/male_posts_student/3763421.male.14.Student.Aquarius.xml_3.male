I could only use my PS2 during the holidays, and I have lots of unfinished games to play. Playing RO everyday could get a bit tedious, especially now that I'm pretty close to reaching level 99 (I'm level 89 at the moment, as my Huntress).  I wanted to try something new, and thus made up my own character for RPing at the Advent Children boards (I'm still waiting for it to get approved). Sometimes, I wish that nobody stays at my home (yes, I love privacy, a lot). I hate having people (especially family members) surrounding me and distracting me all the times. I just wish I could get out from this house, buy a motorbike with unlimited fuel and lots of money, and travel the world ala Kino in "Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World". Though I doubt the world is beautiful now, what with all the pollution and war happening...  Yep, my ambition is to travel around the world learning new things and meeting different people and culture.
