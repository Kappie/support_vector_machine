We're finishing packing today and rushing around trying to find those essentials that we've misplaced lol  Going my Grans later but nothing else interesting really.  I've added about 4 themes to Coffee Chat to make it customizable and I might add a few more :D  Might post before I go to bed, but I might not because I have to wake up at 5:00 (AM not PM lol)
