ELEVEN... what is coming over me.. so then i had a huge math test to study for didn't get a chance to do that because i was sleeping... so i stayed home... i slept until about one today... and guess what... im still exhausted... i dont understand it... and on another side note... wtf is wrong with me... i took the sat in middle school right... i got like a 1250 or something... damn good for not having algebra right?... ive been taking practice tests lately and my score is dropping... a lot... i took one today ... i got a 1080... what the hell... im just hoping its cause im really tired... and it is hard for me to concentrate when it doesn't count for anything... but i am really scaring myself... i guess well see if my theories are true or not come next week... hopefully god is on my side...   -nate
