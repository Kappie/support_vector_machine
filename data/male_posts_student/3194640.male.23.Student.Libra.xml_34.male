My summer semester of school began yesterday. I get to take eight weeks of ethics and intro to short story. If all goes according to plan, I'll be a sophomore by the end of the summer. I'm very excited about that.  The downside to all of this is that I have to be at work by 7am everyday (except Friday). I'll be very tired by the end of the week. Who am I kidding? I'm very tired now!  Not about school, but about church. On Sunday, someone got up and announced to the congregation that his wife has lung cancer. He was very casual about it. He shared with everyone how he was dealing with it (I would hope that he discussed this with his wife first!). It didn't really add anything to the meeting. I'm not trying to be insensitive or anything by saying this, but I am in no way close to this family and I felt that it was inappropriate for him to do that.   People, sometimes, tend to tell you too much information. This is especially true at church where everyone is considered family. That doesn't mean you should share information that's meant for your family and close friends. This is a pet peeve of mine. A couple weeks ago, someone told me that they had been having a hard time that week and had tried to kill themselves. Wow. Did I really need to know that? I had just barely met that person. Maybe I needed to know about someone's ongoing family feud, their dead mother and why they don't have anything nice (except their Palm Pilot)? Or maybe I needed to know that someone else is going to have a vasectomy? I think people, before they speak, need to, first, try and determine if they know me well, then determine what I should know (if I should be told anything). Sometimes, they should just keep certain things to themselves.  Based on experience, some people (especially those at church) don't know how to handle tragic news. A while ago, a missionary from another ward (congregation) passed away while on his mission. This is the way it was announced (I kid you not): "...We will be playing volleyball this Friday night at 7:00pm... by the way [John Doe] from the [other ward] died on his mission. We'll be having a ward activity next Saturday..." A friend of ours, who was close to the young man who had passed away, had somehow not heard the news directly from anyone. She left the meeting in tears.   Word.
