Sorry I didn't let you know, Joshua, that I put you on my site, but I was planning on it. Yeah, I know there isn't alot of blogs on my list yet, but I don't know that many people with blogs who like yaoi, especially boys. Your the only guy whos blog I read, don't feel honored because I am not an honorable person. I'm just a nobody with problems in his life that can only complain on the internet because he doesn't trust anybody in the real world. It sounds like we have a few things in common Joshua, doesn't it?   I really miss Ryan, I told him that I had a dream about him. I asked him if he wanted to know what happened but he said no, so I didn't tell him. I have a feeling that I'm gonna be in love with Ryan for the rest of High School. I keep on fantasizing about him all the time. I imagine me going out with him and eventually asking him to marry me. Wow, thats the first time I ever thought about marriage, but it can't happen anyway because of the stupid laws here in the US. Most people that I would tell about my love for Ryan would tell me to move on, but I don't want to. I want to make Ryan mine no matter what it takes. I think when I come back from vacation I'll try to tell him again but I think my shyness will get in my way again. I think I'm gonna look on the internet for love spells and potions, I know, I'm getting desprite, but I'll do anything for the one I love. TTYl
