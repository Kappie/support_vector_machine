So morbid, yet so full of love and truth.  Krystal has gone missing. Not only missing to me, but to her family as well. I sincerely hope she's ok, and I hope she's enjoying herself. Last night, they made Tina leave. I can't believe that Krystal didn't stand up for her. I think it shows...a lack of...character..or dignity..or something. It actually saddens me to some extent, maybe she's not the person I had thought her to be. Oh well. It's out of my control.  Speaking of out of my control, Crystal hasn't exactly been being nice to me, but when I look at her situation, I can't blame her. She wants so desperately to sort out her life and figure out who she is, but she can't because there's so much in the way. One being a hurt ex-boyfriend, but that is the smallest, probably the easiest to push out of the way right now. I really hope things work out for her...I hate to see her down.   you've lost all feeling for this town  hm.
