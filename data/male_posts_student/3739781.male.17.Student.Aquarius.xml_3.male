I'm leaving my room, My house, my friends, MY FAMILY..... I was just laying on my bed and I realized that I will probably be really really sad when I leave. I'm leaving everything I care and need.  Everyone, Friends, and Family: Thanks for being there whenever I have needed you and I hope that you will be there forever. I will always be here for you, through thick and thin. I'll miss all of you more than the world. It is difficult for me to put my life on hold, but for this short period of time, I'm giving up a year of fun, to gain a lifetime of experiences that I hope I'll never forget, and I hope I'll be able to share with you my new found knowledge. I'll miss you all from the day I leave to the day I get back ~Jonathan  My excitement is building! I can't wait to meet all my new friends in Thailand (mostly Ju and Denise [two brazilians] and Andrew [aussie] and Bianca [South African]). The days are passing so quickly and my excitement is doing the same.  Today is orientation!!! I'll be there at around 5 I think. I'll be there till around Sunday at 10 and I'll get home at around 12-1 in the afternoon.  I'll miss all of you, but at the same time you all will be right next to me ~Jonathan
