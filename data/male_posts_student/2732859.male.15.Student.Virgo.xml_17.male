Anyway, today I was reading in my local paper that has a column that people can call into and have their stupid thoughts published in the paper that the public dicourse and debate that is going on in the country is what the terrorists want to see and that electing Kerry would be letting them win.  SHUT UP!!! Wouldn't just going along with the President and the administration let them win and stifle democracy?
