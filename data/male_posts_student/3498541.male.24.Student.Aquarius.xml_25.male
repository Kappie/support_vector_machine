But first, I need a prototype. For a prototype I need to know how to program USB drivers first, then go back to a drawing board and design the hardware for the toy.   It is not easy to become a millionare (unless you decide to participate in a reality show -- Any geek/nerd dating shows around??)  -Arnav
