You may be thinking right now that irony is just what it is......... its ironic! Ha! But, to some people it is trouble for them. For instance, if you do something for a long time (like running) and one day you decided to stop running, that would be fine. Then, people EXPECT you to run, but when you tell them you are NOT, that is ironic! This irony causes trouble because then people try to sway you to do something (like running) even though you do not want to.  Hence, irony is the core of all evil, if I may say so. And I DO say so! Haha. So there you go. Irony. It is troublesome. You must tune out everyone else and forget what is going on. Don't let others try to sway you the other way when you have for sure and ABSOLUTELY-WILL-"NEVER"-CHANGE it.  That is all for now! I will wait until   JR  comes back to blog some more. For now, "Tengo estudiar para espanol." I have to study for Spanish. Oh, I know JR tried to have me type in a blog today........  Oh yeah! Monkey bowling. I will have to expand more on that later! This is Nick signing off, stay tuned for more.
