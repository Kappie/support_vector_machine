Almost Halfway through every major subject, things are looking sticky, and I'm not talking about the palm of jo's hand.  The lack of entries could be put down to revision, however that would be a tick of such great proportions, like a president not actually winning the election, but is president anyway...but that would never happen....  Not much has happened, I'm still lurking and Jo is on her fourth boyfriend of the year. While bets are on for the length of the relationship, the odds of Jo going out with two people at the same time during the year are at a good 10-1. ;)  Ah, gotta love Jo ^_^
