Anyhow, Akira is about a set of children on which scientific experiements were preformed, giving them amazing powers of death and destruction, able to bend reality with their minds, tearing things and people to shreds, and controlling the minds of others. These children were horrible mistreated, and one by the name of Akira, went insane and killed many people, ending up destroying tokyo. It ends up being up to a kid in a biker gang to fight the children and kill Akira before he can repeat his past massacre. Well, people say that the animation of this film is poor, and that the plot is weak, but I strongly disagree. I believe the plot to be strong, and quite gripping, leaving you on edge. I also find the art to be mezmorizing, constantly amazing you with giant spurts of blud(always a good thing) and great character design. I also love how the motorcycles were drawn, and the drama encompassing the motorcyle gang fights. I pretty much just can't see how anyone could not like this movie, and believe it to have been revolutionary for the anime scene.
