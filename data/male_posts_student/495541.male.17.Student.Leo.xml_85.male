At the moment, I can't recall anything I did.  I suppose that can be called ironic because I made it seem like I had something to write about.  That must be a let-down.  Tonight was great - I really am not sure why but it just was.  I didn't go out or anything of sort - I just stayed home, surfed the web, talked to friends and listened to music.  Somehow out of that I feel enlighened in some way.  Don't get the wrong idea.  I didn't do anything I wouldn't normally do.  It just seemed (and seems) like my ideas were so conclusive and presise.  In some manner I guess you could say I was 'on top' of things.  Weird - is all I'll say to explain it.  Song of the moment: "One Million Miles Away" by J. Ralph  Good night.
