If you don't know, picking berries is the thing I probably hate most. I find that after about a gallon (or less) my mind starts wandering and I start to get impatient.  Considering my mother and grandmother want us to pick about 12 gallons of berries, it makes me even more impatient. *shudders* Which, by the way, we picked 12 gallons this morning, and all the little bug bites on my and them bagging them up to be frozen in the kitchen right now, if proof enough.  On to another topic, I can't believe it is 7:30 already. I guess I expected time to hold still while we picked berries this morning but I'm wondering if it's a good thing it didn't. There's another day lost without reading my book. I'm on page 610 which happens to be a new chapter I haven't read yet. I might read it after I get done here, but I don't know. Anyway, off I go. Bye. Good luck!
