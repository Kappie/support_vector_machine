Mantainance staff supposed to come to the apartment for a checkup, but turns out he couldn't make it. If only i was told earlier, i'd love to sleep a few more minutes :P I went to kafaii's place to meet up wif him and Karen. It was Simpsons Weekend on FOX8, so we took an hour to drag kafaii out of the apartment. We went to Victoria market to pick up some groceries. Karen spent us some nice , hot spanish donuts. MMMHMMMMMMMM !!! It's like "yau char kuai" wif sugar on it. It was lovely, especially during this kind of weather. Next stop , shopping again. Haha. This time it was mostly for food, you know, instant stuff. I bought pasta, instant noodles, milk among some other stuff. Karen tempted us to get muffins even though i didn't want to. I wanted to save. But she talked me into it, darn another few bucks wasted. We then got back to kafaii's place and cooked lunch. Well actually not we, mostly Karen haha. Me and kafaii helped wif the cutting and of course, tasting. Not really hard to cook though, just dump in the ingredients and let it cook ( the pasta has sauce wif it already in powder form ) It was OK, could have been better cause the pasta was a little hard and chewy, not as soft as it should have been. It was still i good meal, we dumped chicken, onions and carrots it in, not to mention all kinds of salt and seasonings we could find in the cupboard haha. While waiting for the food to be ready , i warmed up the muffin i talked about earlier and maaaannnn it was worth it. Ohhh it was hot and oh so delicious! After that, it was back to the apartment for a little rest. Lip Zhun was still out, wif his cousin. Karen decided not to go dinner, so me and Kafaii went to the nearest fastfood outlet for our dinner. Hungry Jacks. Ate a Whopper meal , which is the cheapest around at 5.85 bucks. And after that i went home to get my laptop and brought it over to kafaii's place. There's where i am right now =)
