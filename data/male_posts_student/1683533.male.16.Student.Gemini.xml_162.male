I'll be leaving, and you can't stop me. We've been carrying on to long, I'm sorry, but I'm gone. I've got a bad reputation to think about. I've been dirty, I've been wrong. Maybe someday they'll find that I've washed up. I'm stepping out, to clear my head. I'm breathing in, to fill my lungs. We're all dead. Farewell scenic highway overpass. It's better this way anyways. My lover the river makes  a better soldier than a bride. But I left my suit at the side of her bed, and she's got the warmest body I ever had.  Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love.  Bring the children to the water, and let them see what what heartache did. This matrimony needs a witness, and you can teach them to swim. Don't let your dreamers, grow up to be dead men. Drown us at birth, and save her some time. drifting on on romantic holiday, breathless as her cold arms carry me.  Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love.    What I interpreted it as, as you probably have, is he is commiting suicide by jumping off a bridge into the water below because of heartache.  His dead body is the floater.  As for the line "Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love."  That probably means if you were to drag a net through the lake as if fishing you would find dead bodies from lost loves.  It's pretty chilling, but I really like alot of their lyrics, and no, they arent all about suicide.
