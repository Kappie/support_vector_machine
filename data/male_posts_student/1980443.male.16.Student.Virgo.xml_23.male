Something that I did because I couldn't help it cause Adam to throw something cause he couldn't help it.  It resulted in diminished playing time for both of us; but the memories were still there.  I can't specify what was exactly involved, just me and adam didn't start for like 2 minutes, and then he put us in, haha!  It was sworth it let me tell you.  I miss you, Clinton.  Matematicas...  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
