Now thats not me talking, that's the satistics talking. Princess of what Hostess?  -If I see a girl with a license plate cover that says "daddy bought it but i got it"  there are 9 to 1 odds that she's gonna be stuck up.    - What the heck is with "spinners"?  Ok I get it, you paid three times as much as I did for rims that spin an unnecissary amount.  And thats retarded.  eeeeewwwwwww, look it, the wheel is spinning but they aren'g going anywhere.  Big friken deal.  Couldnt you have spent the money on something else like a college education or something?
