Rascal Flats is opening but it is in Columbia so I will be real tired tommorrow..    Thats when I have to go to A work meeting at 8:00 am god damn..  and then I go back at 1:00 am and work all day..  Then back to Lawrence to Party with McKay..  Then back to work sunday morning..  and then studying for my West Civ 2 Midterm..  Also Claudia is coming in town so she will be partying too..  Lots of stuff going on..  I know I can handle it though..  Wel I'm off to handle it..  Your faithful leader..  King Zeke
