Well I -was- kind of late, but that didn't bother them the first time I managed to do it. Well whatever, nothing I can do about that now right?  Guess I'll make the best of being up early.  Going to do some serious training for Hell Week.  Not that doing anything the day before it starts is really going to help me, or a good idea, I just feel I should do it anyways since if I don't do something physical I'll fall back asleep and not be able to wake up early again tomorrow.   At least now I can spend the whole day fearing tomorrow morning, and actually see my brother off to Japan at the airport this afternoon.
