honestly, we look to our friends/family more than to god without realizing it. maybe not always, but, i mean, when i need to be like, happy feeling i get online and talk to you ppls. i should go and pray for guidance more than i do and that is goin to the wrong place or, store, if you will.  if we would only realise(not spelt wrong, jus' bustin' sum proper cs lewis english on yall) how important the holy spirit is to our lives, daily. if you could be so in tune to the spirit(as you should be) just think how much more effective we would be. if we were lead by the spirit in every aspect of our lives, we wouldn't have the pitiful problems we do. we wouldn't be perfect, adn the only good in us is god, cuz we suk. major big time.  think about it: if you went onto your skool and were totally lead by the spirit you would know ppls problems without them telling you. no joke, that's how it works. god will use you n ways greater than you can imagine, simply because that's his will. that none should perish, and if you don't mind me saying, our little get together and go to riverpark and ask ppl the two ee questions doesn't get the first half of the half of the job done. do you know that a majority of today's churches don't believe what i'm talking about??? ppl you see that are "christians" are just as lost as the next heathen. i've heard in youth groups, pastors sayin how being a christian makes you a target of spiritual warfare. guess what, i've looked around youth groups and thought to myself, ok, none of you really have to worry about it, the enemy has you right were it wants you. living the lukewarm life, jus chillin with some friends then it's out the door and bak to life. oh yes, the enemy has a great deal of chuckling to do, but not for long.  now is our time, as P.O.D. said in set it off, " we are half past late". and now, it is a bit behind, but we'll make up for it. **looks around searching for an 'amen' or a 'shake the tree', but receives none as the church is a sleeping giant.**well guess what, it'll only take one big god using a few small ppl to wake that thing up, cuz if you hadn't realised it yet(cs lewis english again) we, no, not we. he(jesus) conquered death hell and the grave. and the grave. nice, isn't it? not just death, not even just hell. death, hell, and the grave. s'right, my homeboy jesus (hay suse) could whip up a good one or two, beings he is god and all powerful he told a thing or two to the enemy.  which is the beginning and end of all our problems. it is the end of all our problems cuz if you hadn't caught on yet, we are on the winning team. but it was the beginning of our problems because the enemy knew he had lost, and that we no longer had those problems, so, he had to prevent us from knowing we had the victory, cuz if we don't know it, we don't have it. call it faith, if you will. if we don't walk in our victory, guess what, we don't have it. i can get sick(or can i?) but if i walk in the lord,  knowing i am healed (knowing, it's called, exercising your faith) than i am in fact healed. but if i let my mind be won over by the enemy and think, oh man, i just don't feel so good, guess what?? there went the victory jesus gave me. christians think god's supernatural healing power is just for benny hinn and cancer. if it weren't f of god's power and my victory that he's given me and is giving me daily, i'd still be living in the lie that working with my dad and uncle and all that heavy stuff gave me a bad back. since i walk in christ and his victory, i know i am above that crap.(no legalism here, i am not going to hell because i said crap) oh yes. it's all  gravy in my hood. which jsut happens to be where my homeboy jesus kicks it.   s'right, he's right up my ally y'all. he took the hit so i wouldn't have too. every thing i did, he took blame for. but see that's not the point. christians say how great it is that jesus took the blame for their sin, so they wouldn't have to. well, it's more than that. it meant a few things that caused jsus more torment than anyone will ever go thru. i've seen the stupidest videos about how much physical pain jesus' crucifiction was and blah blah blah. how many of y'all are familiar with the jesus freaks books??? there are ppl who have gone thru the exact same thing PHYSICALLY as jesus and did it happily for his name that they wouldn't deny. so then, idiots can't say it was so terrible(tho it was) physically cuz when it comes to christ it is SPIRITUAL stuff we are talking about. almost everyone overlooks this one thing that was what some great man ssaid when he was crucified. he wa crucified 'exactly' the way jesus was because the ppl killing him wanted to make a point. he went to his death happily. the killers asked why he went to it so joy filled whereas jesus took to it as torment. was this man better then jesus?? the man replied "yes it is the same death, but the same god that turned his back on jesus when we went to it, is smiling on me right now."  um, that's not exact quote, but that sums it up. god will never leave you or forake you, get the picture??? what did jesus ask as he died???  MY GOD MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?!  hello!! wake up call!! boom!! god turned hsi back on jesus, so he would never have to turn it on you. now aren't we all just a little bit more thankful jesus took our sins instead fo us??? yes. it's a good thing jesus was perfect, because it was harder than all get out for him being perfect. but see, evn a perfect man is nothing once god has turned his back on him. then, this is were it gets fun to be god. jesus gets to conquer a) death-that should be fun b)hell- SUCKERPUCNH!!!! c)the grave-s'right y'all, walked right out of the sucker.   now that we all feel grat again, let's start acting liek we're saved. and know this, because god is in you and with you, it's ok to whip the enemy every now and then. no more sissy christian stuff. take authority.   christians tend to be like, oh lord, if it's your will, let this happen. hello ppl, jesus said all authority in heaven and in earth has been given unto me.......and then take this concept, he is in you. bam, in the name of jesus, yo got a little bit more authority than you thought. don't ever think you are the oen that's good because hello, we all are like nothing. but then, don't htink you are nothing cuz with christ you are everything.  don't do the whole if it's your will let so and so get save. he already said it was is will.  in the name of jesus, i believe so and so will get saved and i thank you in advance for their salvation and spiritual growth........see the difference.     take up all he has for you, you are unstoppable becuase of him. it's great, you get all this power but you have to watchi it, because really, it's not you. so live in victory and power, knowing it's him that does it thru you.  that would be me, and one day, the world will know
