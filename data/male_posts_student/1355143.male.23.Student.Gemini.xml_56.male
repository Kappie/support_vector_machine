Long story, but Keira has caused me problems before.  So, I was watching the news the other night, and they had an interesting occurrence at Wal-Mart. I'm sure most of you know what Wal-Mart is and that they sell products for cheap, but I'm not sure if you truly understand the clientele that visit a Wal-Mart store. These are your run-o-the-mill white trash, broke ass, got-nothing-better-to-do Americans (whether legal or illegal). By the way, I was just at Super Wal-Mart last night at midnight, but that's beside the point. So a lady goes into Wal-Mart and tries to pay with a 1 million dollar bill. Apparently the cashiers aren't as dumb as they look 'cause they caught on, and the lady was found to have 3 more in her purse. As if this lady with a NASCAR t-shirt and hair straight out the 80s would have 3 million dollars in her purse. Do we even make a 1 million dollar bill? I couldn't imagine a use for it, or why we would make it other than for Montgomery Burns to steal. Or for people to use at Wal-Mart. Hell, I had to wait 15 minutes last night 'cause I wanted 60 bucks cash back and they had to go to the vault to get it. How did THIS lady think she was going to get change from her million dollar bill??? Wal-Mart...finishing the job for George W.
