Glad to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same...  Well, after such an awesome beginning to my day things went decidedly downhill.  Before heading out to school I figure I would check up on the special circumstances form that we sent in - so I check on the Net and find out they (finally) processed it.  At this point I get that gut-wrenching sense of anticipation somewhat like what you feel right before you get a test back - how much I get back from this will highly dictate how much loan money I have to take out for Washington.  So I go to check on the Financial Aid page...and nothing.  I didn't get a freaking thing more than I got from my FAFSA application.  I don't get it - last year I was in virtually the same circumstance and got a LOT of money, yet this year they don't even bump up the amount of subsidized loans I can get.  So anyway...on this cheery note I head off to school.  Which was relatively banal except for the giddiness of knowing that it was the last day of classes! :-D  Got all the review sheets and all....oh, and in what is perhaps my hardest class we got a take-home exam (which is definitely a good thing).  But the quesrtions is odd - it's not really about the substance of the class, but about the class itself (kind of like an evaluation)...  So anyway...get home, decide I don't want to start working right away, so I plump down for some TV.  Watch U-571 on TNT (or maybe it was USA...whatever), then suddenly am overcome with a great weariness (could it have something to do with going to bed at 12:30 and then waking up @ 5:30 for basketball?  Maybe?).    So go upstairs and take a nap from 6:00 to 8:00 (I'm just starting to remember how messed up my sleeping patterns become during exams time).  Wake up, come downstairs...and of course the MAC championship is on ESPN2 (between BG and Miami @ Oxford, so of course I feel a compelling interest to watch since it's 2 Ohio teams).  But here is where having a laptop is beautiful...I can just lug it on into the TV room and actually start working on my paper while watching the game (at least, that's the plan - I think it was about a 60-40 split between the game and my paper).  So here I am, once again, beginning a paper at an ungodly hour...good thing I planned for it ;)  Oh, in reference to Lisa's blog...I second the motion to take the "None of the above" option off tests, but could we perhaps add it to election ballots? :P
