Well that's what it feels like for me anyways. Well my first years of high school weren't exactly smooth, but I got through em' with onnly the minor problems. Grades, women, sports, and life. None the less I got through it with out failin at anything. My junior year though was a blast. I spent the year in Brazil livin' it up. If you don't know what I mean I went to school when I wanted, partied evr chance I got, and spent a lot of time with the most beautiful women in the world. Don't get me wrong it wasn't all beer and parties. The adjusting to life in another country was a pain in the ass along with dealin with a whole new way of life without your family for support. I walked away with an understanding for another culture, the ability to speak another language, and a whole bunch of friends I'll remember for the rest of my life. Now I'm back to what is considered by most as my old life, but it dosen't seem like mine at all. So now i will continue with my highschool life and finish it up and then move on to college. For now I wish you well.  Remember: What is comingwill come no matter what we do,   all that matters is how we deal with it.
