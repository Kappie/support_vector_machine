My mom, dad, Derek and Chris were all off at work (with the exception of Chris, he's at school). I played a little golf (still haven't seen any commercials for it) and at 9:30 watched some SpongeBob. I haven't seen that show for a while, but I have seen the one that was on. After SpongeBob was over I skateboarded down to the library. That's right, I finished my book...again. I am now reading Alvin Journeyman; the fourth book in the series.  I started that and read for about an hour. I think I'm going to go make lunch now. Even though it's a bit early for it. My shelf now has two more items on it. I need to find something that will go there. It needs to be something that I would like to have easily accesible so there is actually a point to putting it up there. I guess I could put my CDs up there, but I would still have plenty of room (seeing as how I only have somewhere around 10 CDs). I think I am going to buy a CD player and put it up there and get some good Classical CDs. Well, all this "Blogging" is making me hungry. I am going to go get some food. I will fill everyone in on my day later. Remember: Two wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts do.
