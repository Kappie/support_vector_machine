So, I go to school and this one girl smiles at me, and is like "Hi, Marcus!" and I seriously felt so much better the entire day.  It was the weirdest thing, like I guess it really made me feel better to know that the Light of God really is in each of us.    In less serious news, I printed out a page from the FBI sponsored BBP coloring book, and everyone found that funny.  In spanish I ate my 55 that I got on my Spanish quiz, and told Mrs. Lawrence it tasted like failure, then she said everyone would get 5 points to it.... so apparently it tasted like a D.  I handled that one pretty well, even though it didn't get to me.  Whatever, I guess the little things can really make a person happy.  No matter how sappy that sounds.
