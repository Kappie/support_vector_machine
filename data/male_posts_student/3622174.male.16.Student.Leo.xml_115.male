So, of course, I stayed here, and if I plan to go out tomorrow, then I'm gonna have to not ride the bike (I'm getting good with the tricks, but its too dang hot to ride it).  Anyway, today was a much better day than the past two days.  I think the whole summer boredism thing is starting to wear off as I head into this busy time of my summer... driving days on Monday and Tuesday.  Universal next Wednesday.  Then, Monday after next, Yearbook camp starts, and I come back on Thursday.  Then, Friday, I leave really early for New York, stopping in North Carolina on the way up.  Then, I come back on August 2nd, and school starts on August 9th.  My boring summer is FINALLY, FINALLY over, and the fun part now begins.  By the way, I'm posting this part because of an incident that happened last year: I CANNOT FORGET MY BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR.  I will be posting this on a regular basis to avoid what happened last year, when I...well, forgot my birthday.  It was definitely a weird day, and I'm not sure how it was that I forgot it, but, oh well.  And, also, a list of extra stuff I'm taking to the workshop with me, so I can remember that:  Extra Mouse Mouse Pad Xbox Games Yearbook DVDs  I'll be posting that list too alot until I leave for camp, because I read through my blog a lot, and the closer it is to the top, the better.  So, I'm not going to forget either my birthday or the extra stuff I need.    Anyway, something weird has been going on with Blogger, and it's been bad... I'm not thinking about switching blog providers (I'm still too addicted to teh B10gg3r!).  But, hopefully they fix it soon, because I haven't been able to load this site correctly most of the time.  It's just typical site problems, I'm sure, but, hopefully it'll be fixed soon.  That's it from me for now.  I'll be back in about 1/2 an hour with a brand new eBay Hunter, and then later tonight for Late Night Bloggin'.  See ya then!
