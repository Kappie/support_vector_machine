Our pavilion (japanese) seemed to be quite ok, thought we cleared out of food very quickly, many times.    As for the show... besides the little timing problem we had, I think it was ok ^^;; need to get Trisha to send me the video clip *grins*   Don't feel like writing that much... did everyone else just give up on their blogs? And why is nobody online? (Actually there are many people, but still!)   ~Chronos
