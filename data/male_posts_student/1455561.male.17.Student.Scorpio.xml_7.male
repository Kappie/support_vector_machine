Living where i do ( oh yes i have learnt not to give away details on the net, not again) missing the bus is hardly the disaster made out by these little bastards.  "excuse me mate, can i have 50p for the bus i havent got any money"  1) if the fare costs 50p then its only going to be about a mile and as you are - most likely to be -  a young male than its not going to be that bad  2) Its spring: the walk will be nice  3) why are you asking me whilst walking away from the bus station?  4)  why are you only asking me?  5) why arent you doing a dance to earn my money?  Some people may accuse me of being a bit sceptical (paticularly anyone who has tried to convince me of the existence of pens) but by giving them money we are assuming a lot  the fact that they got to town without getting a return ticket on the bus is pretty laughable anyway, particularly as they would probably be planning to return at some point.  But admittedly they could have been left in town after being given a lift in or something.  Even so, unless they have the genes of a rabbit they would have foreseen the need to get home on the bus in the future and so any normal person would have made sure that they had that money left from their activities in town, if they have forgotten to do that, then they deserve to walk and for myxamitosis to destroy their bunny lives.  Even if i had done that,  i wouldnt go round asking people to fund my trip home.  Admittedly, disaster could have struck and they could have been mugged or something but in that case, surely the police would be a better option than a bus  nevertheless whenever i am asked whether i can afford their bus ticket i will continue to use the same response " i am sorry ive forgotten my wallet today" despite all this going through my head.  i will probably never tell one to go and shove a bus into their eye, or enquire as to exactly why they are asking me and why the want to live like this, or whether they will fund the operation i will need on my hand when i give them a slap.  because that is what being british is all about. pretending to be naive but inwardly hating the universe and wishing to violently hurt many of the people who surround you.  In britain even criminals receive a polite decline of their offer of taking your money free of charge.    now, where did i put that coffee?
