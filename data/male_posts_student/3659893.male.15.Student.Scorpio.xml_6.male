I really dont care about some writers dream to travel the country. But seeing how I'm being semi-forced to do this reading I have to care.  *me trying to care*  Part 1, Chapter 1  This chapter is kinda vague and I dont get some of the refrences and jokes in it. I guess thats what i get for not being part of the beat generation.
