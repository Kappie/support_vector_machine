It seems to happen every holiday; you think "Ooh, I'll be able to do that and that and that", but you never get round to doing it. Maybe I should just approach holidays with the aim of doing nothing, and then I'll somehow do lots of stuff. Hmm...  Recently I've been trying to hold off buying things, snice I'm saving up for my gap year. I did pre-order  Battlefield Vietnam  a couple of days ago, but I know I'm going to play it, so I think that's justified. I've resisted the temptation of the  24 Series 2  DVD boxset on the grounds that it'll take 18 hours to watch and I could be doing loads of other stuff during that time.  Well I'm going to cut this entry short because I'm being repeatedly harassed by my cat for food. I'm afraid that he may pee on my keyboard or something if I don't go off and feed him!
