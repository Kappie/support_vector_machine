I would beg to differ. I've now been out of high school for about a year and a half, and I am a very different person now than I was then. Almost every single aspect of what I believe has changed. I used to believe that alcohol was a very evil thing, and should not be consumed by anyone. Now, I see it as something to enjoy, in moderation, to heighten conversation and meet new people. In politics, I was once very leftist in my beliefs, with a socialist attitude that made members of the NDP look like Conservatives. Now, I'm almost more to the right, I still believe in social programs and a degree of welfare, but also value the economic upsides of a free market. On a religious note, I was once a strong Catholic, out to convert the world. Now, while I don't deny the possibility that there may be a higher power out there, I do know that it is  not  the God that has been created by mankind. As mel put it, I was "out to save the world, or at least that worthy of being saved". It rings true, I was going to save the world, I was going to make a difference, I was going to win.  It's a different world out here, and I suppose people change accordingly to their surroundings. Or perhaps we just grow up, grow out of the feeling of immortality, and realize that the world just isn't meant to be saved.
