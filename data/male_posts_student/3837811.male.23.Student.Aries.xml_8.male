These are some really cool pictures from the  urlLink lomography website.           Cool lomos....    Iremembered the time when i was with my ex-gf, taking a camera around town one whole dayand took pictures as and when we liked.. Not of us, but ofthings, happenings..But i have no idea where those pictures went, lol... Haha, oh well, i wenton a snapping spree with my digi camin my room, this is the best i came out with..         Well, one of these days, i might just go around town and take some really lomo with a bit of help from photoshop.. Haha, coolway of taking photos..
