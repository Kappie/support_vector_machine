Another train from Boston and another from Hartford both leave at 4:30 Eastern/Central time going 150mph.  400 passengers are on the Boston train, 500 on the LA train, and 200 on the Hartford train.  The trains will all intersect and crash in the middle of the US in one of 7 different cities and the news will cover it.  Each cities population determines the level of coverage.  What time will the trains crash, in what city, how much news coverage will there be, and who's hotter: Dan Rathers or Stone Philips?
