Do you want to know what my resolution is?  Well, I won't tell you because I don't have a New Year's resolution.  Would you like to know why?  Because New Year's resolutions are for people with no will power.  That's right, lazy people that need an excuse to change something about themselves that they don't like.  If you decide that your resolution is to lose weight, then here's an idea, lose the damn weight.  Don't wait until New Year's so that you can stuff your face and gain twenty pounds during Christmas, start now and do it because your fat!   I'm sorry but why do you have to wait for New Year's?  Recognize the problem and fix it.  Oh, and if you decide to do something, go through with it.  Don't chicken out and give up!
