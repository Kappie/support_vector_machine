First Dave calls me up and tells me he's gonna pick me up, cause me, Dave, Allie and Matt are going to see Spiderman on the opening day.  I'm not sure if its in this blog, but the last time i went to see somehting on opening day, the shit really hit the fan.  But anyways, the movie was pretty good and uneventful, its what happened afterwards that really shocked me.  Me and Dave have this good friend, Stephanie, and out of the blue, Steph calls Dave up and tells us to come over, as her parents have left her home alone.  Now, until that point in time, I have never set foot in her house before.  FUCKING AMAZING MANSION is what Steph lives in.  It's huge and gorgeous.    Well getting back to the story, we get to Steph's house, and we go in, and she tells us that she doesn't know how to cook.  So me, being the gourmet I am, make her kraft dinner for the next day.  She opens a beer up, and I have 2 sips and all of a sudden I felt trashed.  I'm not sure why because I had a full stomach, but I was out of it.  Anyways, in the end, we were going to bring Steph to Tim's house, but his dad was up, so she came with Dave to drop all of us off.  We arranged that the next day we'd go over to her house and do shit.
