Tadano took part in the video three years ago when he was a college student... "I was young, playing baseball, and going to college and my teammates and I needed money." Funniest line ever:   Tadano knows he may face fan abuse in major league parks such as Yankee Stadium, where heckling the visitors is part of the pageantry.  He joked that he's ready for it.   "I don't understand English, so it doesn't really matter,'' he said.
