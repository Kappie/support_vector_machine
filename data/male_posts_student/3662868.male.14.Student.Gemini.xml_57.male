I can't be sure.   I've been loosing it a lot lately.   Today I was mowing the lawn, turned around, and the other half of the yard wasn't cut.   I finished a book. The Color of Water.   Horrible. Shit. Crap. Terrible. Fucktapated.   Don't read it.    It's boring until the end.    Then they give you a shitty ending.   Did it leave a lot un finished? No.   Did it leave you wanting more? Hell no.   It sucked and that's all I have to say.
