I've managed to get such an inordinate amount that I am unable to attend crew for the day.  : /  I really hate missing practice although I'm unsure if my coach is there today or not... either way missing practice is no fun, especially on a "row day" (in which we row of course).  The most prominent of this homework is the iSearch paper (boy, that sounds Mac-ish) which entails quite a bit of, well, searching.  Primarily tedious research.  I happened to choose Counter-Strike and some other elements of the online game industry and it has so far turned out fairly informative and interesting indeed.   I just bought a new mouse and i love it to death:  Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse (Metallic Red).  The metallic red color matches my PC's case quite well.  In addition the scroll wheel (also tilts from side-to-side; Microsoft's tilt-wheel technology) is just major sexah.  Grips well in my hand; very contoured.  I h3arts t3h mu0s3!  Go buy one.  Now!!  And now the homework.  There still remains much to do.  See most of you soon and chat with the rest of you later. Tah Tah.
