And, considering the fact I have not been doing any sport....I would have thought my intake should be exceeding my water loss.   I was the first one up this morning. So, I went down stairs and fed the cats and cleaned out their litter. I really hate doing that. When we had Kenzo it was so much easier. He just came and went whenever he felt the urge. So, we never needed a litter tray. But, ever since he was knocked down and killed out on the road, my control-freak wife will not let the Paris  Hugo out of the house. What makes matters even worse is she is always screaming at them for doing this or that. You know normal cat things. Like jumping on the furniture...Or, chasing each other around. To tell you the truth. I love pets, but life would be more calm and cleaner without them.  Oh yeah, how could I forget. Before the bitch could even say goodmorning she started complaining that I put the trash out this morning. How fucked is that? She said she was going to change the cats' litter, and that she was going to use the trash bag. I just don't understand why someone would make such a big deal over nothing. I just wish she would chill out for once.
