Often this bond resembles a family, even going so far as having people play certain roles.  We lost one of our best cashiers today at work. Jan had taken off 6 weeks for surgery, and apparently did some job searching while she was at it.  Understandably, she wanted to be closer to home, and she's always lived at least an hour's drive away.  The thing about Jan is that her customer service was top notch, plain and simple.  A toothy grin and inquisitive, "Hi, how are you?" for everybody, be they crotchety old man or haughty middle aged woman.  This departure sets us in a "moving on" mood, and as one employee was heard saying, "Heck of a way to start the year, eh?"  Today as the rain fell down and one of our family members departed for the last time, our smiles felt empty, and our greetings as hollow as a rotted out dogwood tree.
