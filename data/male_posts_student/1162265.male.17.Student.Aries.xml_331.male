On that note, Camille was talking to me today, and I saw a blue speck on her tongue.  So I scream "Oh my gawd! You've got your tongue pierced!"  I shouldn't have said that around little kids, she had to pretend it was gum and take it out lol.  Needless to say she was pissed.  Ewwww... Tongue piercings look so painful.   Speaking of body modifications does anyone know what a Babolonyian (SP?) tattoo is?  It's nickname is "barking" like bark on a tree.  It's seriously nasty stuff, that's another thing I hope never to see.  Memes man!
