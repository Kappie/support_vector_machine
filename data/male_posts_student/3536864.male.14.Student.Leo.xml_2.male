It's coming this way! Do the sleep act! Quickly I bury my face in the cushions of the couch. I need heellp. Please, hey, wake up! Hello? I try to filter out the calls for aid. Failing at that, I pull the cranky Lord-of-touch-me-and-you're-dead act, and lo and behold it worked. I settle back into my nap..Ah, it's been a good day. My friend came over, stayed up late working on a lost cause escapde  that had been destined to fail since we set out, then I had passed out on the couch. I woke up and took the role of couch potato, then talked to a few friends by way of keyboard, and then ate some food. As I contemplate all this I am rudely interrupted yet again by a more urgent call. My Wheel is coming off! So I grunt, get up, and come outside. AaUgH! The sun! I need my sunglasses. I come back inside, get my sunglasses, and it comes to pass that the bolt had broken. Therefore the wheel was coming out. In my great genius, I don't search for the same size bolt, but find a small bolt with and place large discs on either end. With help from a friend, I tighten the bolt and it works! I, am a skilled metal worker. Well, maybe not, but there is my episode for today. Tune in tomorrow...well, not tomorrow, just later. I'll put something else amazing here. Caio!
