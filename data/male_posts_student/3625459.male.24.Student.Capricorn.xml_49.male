This new installment has ahealthy dose of Bush Bashing, of which i did get a little tired.It seemed more like a political campaign. Towards the end when Michael More goes around asking Senators to sign up their kids for the army …..umm isn’t it the kids who are supposed to decide ? Which senator would want to speak to Michael More? For all you might know he might secretly be making a documentary on the senator.  Still cannot get her out of my mind. I didn’t know that a whole lotta drama, about the election campaign, happened in Florida. Well I did expect Al Gore to win; no I am not politically affiliated to either one of the parties. If you ask me politicians are schmucks.  Constantly had this feeling about how did she feel when all these things were happening. I remember when it happened; Anand told me that some one had rammed a plane into the world trade centre and how his friend would be very sad because he loved the World Trade Centre. It didn’t even occur to me that …. woah, its actually a big deal. I remember going home telling dad that some one had rammed a plane into the WTC. It just didn’t matter to me. Should it have? Don’t know.  All thought the movie all I wondered as to what C might have been thinking when this happened. How did she react?  Was this documentary just a political gimmick? Not a single mention of Blair or the war efforts offered by the Coalition forces. All what he depicted about the war were the horror stories, and the shady side of it. People getting shot and blood and guts spilled all over the victim. I am not that well informed on the war in Iraq, but to me it did sound like a bunch of half truths. It was funny watching Bush not leave the class room in Florida, when he was informed about the attack. Hell, does the president decide? Or do his aides tell him what to do? May be he was told not to do anything and await further orders from his aides. I don’t know, I could be wrong on this.  Aren’t you supposed to turn off the camera when people break down? Hell no let it roll; watch ‘em cry, it adds to the effect! Watching a hardened mother who so firmly believed in the army, gets disillusioned when she loses her son. Watching Iraqi women wail and curse, when the bodies of their sons are taken away. When are people gonna realize that war doesn’t solve anything. People like Michael Moore make money by selling half truths. Stupid politicians like Bush condemning American and Iraqi citizens to their death, for whose fault. Was the war fought because of oil or was it a “Wag the Dog” strategy? There were a whole lot of wars in the last decade, the 90;s had so many conflicts in so many countries. All this leads you to ask just a few questions …why. What’s the purpose of life? Why must the innocent suffer? Why do kids get killed?  The bottom line about war, no one wants it. Mothers lose a lot during wars, which every side may the sons/daughters be fighting on.     One of the things about being either under a democracy or under a regime, to an average man is that it doesn’t matter. All that matters is getting 3 square meals a day, making sure that your family has sufficient to eat and the little kids get a proper education, so that when they grow up they might have more money to lead a little more comfortable life. Do politics, regimes, dictators and democracy really matter to an average citizen? Aren’t we all just sheep?
