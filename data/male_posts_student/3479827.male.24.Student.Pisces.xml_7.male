The hotel was quite basic since everything is brought up the mountain on foot. There are on roads and no cable car past half way, so there are men carrying huge sacks on their shoulders up the mountain to the hotel. I made me wonder how on earth they built the hotel in the first place!  We were sharing 6 to a room, 3 couples over 3 single bunk beds. Our plan was to get up at 4am to see the sun rise, but our plan was foiled by early morning rain and a thick mist. So, we slept a little later and had breakfast before leaving the hotel at 6am. Today, we saw another side of the mountain, including a famous pine tree that looks like a person with open arms welcoming you to the mountain. Once again, the scenery was amazing. Sometimes it was a little scary when the path got close to the edge with little or no fence. Anyhow, i survived despite me being clumsy.   Once we'd seen everything on our mountain tour, it was time to go back down to earth. There were 2 choices, take the cable car, or walk. We chose to walk, especially as we'd taken the cable car up at the beginning. Now, going down is not as easy as you might think. Imagine, thousands and thousands of steps, mostly going down (but still some upwards). If you're unfit like me, about a quarter of the way down it feels like your legs have turned to jelly and your knees have seized up. You also have to carefully watch each step so as not to slip or fall. As if that wasn't enough, you've also got people going up the mountain trying to get past you.  We descended quite quickly in the end, in just over 2 hours. At the end we reached the restaurant where the rest of the group were waiting. Once i sat down there, i didn't want to move my legs again! In total, we were climbing, walking, or going down from 6am to 12pm! I feel i really accomplished something i've never done before in my life and yuqi and i had a great experience.  After the mountain, our tour briefly took us to a tea shop and a zoo. The zoo deserves a mention when they milked (get the venom out its fangs) a very poisonous snake (called the "5 steps snake" due to the supposed number of steps you can walk before dying once bitten). Once milked, they poured out the venom and invited us to drink it. I declined, but several others tried it and walked more than 5 steps, so it must be ok :)  and that was the end of our tour. Yuqi and i left the group to look around a very old and traditional shopping street. It was very nice and we had a glorious buffet meal at a restaurant there. After that, we came back to the train station to await our train back to shanghai. I'm writing this now in the tea lounge beside the station over a nice cup of green tea.  That's all for today, more from shanghai tomorrow before we head back to yuqi's home in the evening.  Interesting china fact #7 - in most shops and restaurants the staff don't wear name badges. Instead they are given a number. Traditionally the chinese don't like to reveal their names publicly.
