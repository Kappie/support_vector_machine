I started this morning by watching the Tintin movie;  Tintin and the Lake of Sharks , which, although nothing like Herg√©'s books, was quite enjoyable.  What interested me about the television version is that the title sequence differs from the video version ... yes, I know I live a sad life :( .  You can't blame me though, as I have been under the weather for several days.  If you find that reasonably interesting, I suggest you wait for another post ...
