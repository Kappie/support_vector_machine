Well its that time of the Year to retrospect on the year gone by  look forward to a cheerful yeah ahead. Its also time to make the New Year Resolutions. I have faithfully adhered to the maxim that "All Resolutions are meant to be broken (!!)" till now and  hope to break that jinx the at least in the coming year . I better break the jinx since I badly need a makeover .                                                    Enjoy the New Year and let us hope 2004 turns out to be a Prosperous  peaceful year for one and all.
