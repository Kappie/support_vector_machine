Firstly: I went out biking tonight at 6:30. I got a flat just west of Jamaica ave. in Cottage Grove. It was quite a long ways to walk to Derrick's house, my house, or library-which was close to closing. So I walked in the cool evening air over to Amanda's place, where I waited until 9:00, when I used a Schwan Foods employee's cell phone to call my dad. Shortly thereafter, Amanda and Emily got home from the Park play, which was apparently pretty good. So...after waiting out in the cold (in shorts and a t-shirt, I might add) for quite  a spell, I finally got heat. Then my dad showed up, demanding that I leave right that moment. On top of that...well...I'll just leave it that I was disappointed.  Oh yeah, and there's a test tommorow. fuck. in Social, so it shouldn't be too hard, but its a test nonetheless. I just want to sleep all day tommorow and not have to do ANYTHING. Not have to care about anything, not have to give a fuck.
