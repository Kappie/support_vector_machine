Ha, like I ever could.  It's 11:11 again, and it's not a coincidence. I started it at this time on purpose, like a lot of things.  *makes a wish*  1128464234235820913th time's a charm.   Sinking lower and lower, in the visage of my own mediocrity. It's my fault that I'm here, isn't it? I dug the hole, did I not? No, I'm beginning to think otherwise. Beginning, no less. Always.  I don't really even know what to say anymore...  He breathes words of truth. Or, at least, that is how I see them. And does it really matter if I'm blind otherwise? After all, here I am, safe in my own little conniving existence, apart.  What lies ahead? Ever after.
