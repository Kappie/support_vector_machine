The bands were generally crap, but I got to talk to some people. Not bad for the one dollar entry fee.   We (our family) are not on the top of the pile financially, but we survive and are doing well thanks to money management skills. It annoys me when people live in absolute poverty and are not helped by the government. Much more annoying are the....let's face it, westys who are horribly dirty, have 6 or 7 kids and just can't manage to even have a bath! If they bothered they could at least look presentable when they go out in public.   2 411 H4X0RZ 0(_)7 7/-/3R3, (_) R0(|  That was my brief interlude in hacker language which is pointless.  Anyway, I had a pretty bad day today but I'm feelin' fine for some reason. I almost refused to get up this morning, then the thought of someone at school inspired me. I have come to a strange conclusion for the 'meaning of life' lately also, I think that the meaning of life is other people. Because without other people, there would be no meaning in life. You have the top job, and the bottom job. You tell everyone what to do, then have to do it. The reason why I can be bothered doing anything is other people. That's just what I think though. Bye for now anyway. Cya tomorrow.  P.S. I am getting confused on what to call my posts as i usually run off on a random tangent.
