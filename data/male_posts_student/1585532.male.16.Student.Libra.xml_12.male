Two words:  TIME MANAGEMENT.  God its hard.  Anyways, I'm looking at buying a laptop, so I can sattelite from my laptop and run this thing wherever the hell I'm at.  I just need to find a reasonably priced one.  I don't need some new-fangled $1000 machine.  I just need a workhorse with a CD-ROM Drive.  Damn.....I hate technology.
