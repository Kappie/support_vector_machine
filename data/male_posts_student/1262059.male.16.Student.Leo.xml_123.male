I only lost my math textbook only recently... who knows how much those textbooks cost altogether? Like 100? *sigh* Not only that, I lost my science unit 5... I spend like most of my working time during Christmas on that. (welll... that's not much, considering I didn't work much during Christmas, but still!) At this point, breaking down seems like a tempting thing to do... but nah. lol,  "Don't Be Discouraged" ... *plays song thru head*    Aaaanyways, it was really weird today. I went to the math area during second, just to take out some units, then the person there was asking "math contest?", and i was like "oO" and I somehow got dragged in and started doing the math contest thingy. Later, I found that it was on the announcements, which I don't pay attentiont to XP ah well... I guess that wasn't SO bad... since I didn't really have anything planned for that period.    Back to  "drowning for my life" , lol ^^;;   ~Chronos
