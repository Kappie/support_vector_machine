There was onve a good woman who was well known among her circle of friends for her simple faith and her grear calmness in the midst of many trials. Another woman, hearing about her from a considerable distance, said, "I must go and see this woman, and learn the secret of her calm and happy life." She went, and as she approached the woman, she said, "Are you the woman with the great faith?" To this question the woman replied, "No, I am not hte woman with a great faith, but i am the woman who has a little faith in a great God." Thus, our faith is only as good as the object of that faith. We might have faith in ourselves and fail, we may have faith in another and be disappointed, but when our faith is centered in the Almighty God, We shall not be confounded. The Bible tells us that Abragam believed God, and this faith was counted unto him for righteousness. Put your faith in the unfailing God.
