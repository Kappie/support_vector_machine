I don't think enough people realize just how deep this man truly is. He's a poet in the truest sense of the word. All you have to do is listen to that song and you'll understand. Songs like "I shall be released" and "Shelter from the storm" are other good examples. I know this is a pointless post but I had to get the word out. Listen to Bob Dylan NOW. Don't download it like a cheap little putz, get off your ass and go down to the closest music store and buy as much of his stuff as you can. As much as possible, he's like money ya can never have enough.
