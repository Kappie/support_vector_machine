Aight I havent been writing for a while cuz i've been busy with stuff, but now i'm back and I feel extremely happy today cuz I finally found the courage to talk to a girl whom i've been liking for 6 months. Though it only lasted a mere 10 seconds I enjoyed every moment of it, I was so afraid that I might stumble with my words but I didn't! Though I feel that she's been trying to talk to me but she can't find the courage to, it might just be wishful thinking on my part, who'd like me anyways? :P Well I felt that way, I always try to talk to her but I get afraid at the last moment. Well I finally did it, thanks to my good friend Keong who gave me a counselling session yesterday. Keong is like an older brother to me, hes 4 years older than me and I go to him for advice. Well thats all for today, boy do I feel good! n_n! -Mel     Ragnarok Thoughts For Today:   Hmm, I haven't been playing Ragnarok for quite some time now, but I still have some leftover knowledge that might actually help? O_o Anyways, let's talk about pvping, probably the most common interest for professional players who have gotten all of the game's secrets and have all their equipment ready. What better thing to do than fight monster A.I? Fight another player's intellect. In pvp, the main 3 rock paper scissors classes are considered, with the rest being classes out of the original 3. Hunter > Wizard > Knight > Hunter. In this case, the Wizard is a simple kill for the hunter, whilst being strong against the knight, that crushes hunters. However, in ragnarok the concept is slightly different from the original strategy games. Knights can win wizards, wizards can kill hunters, and hunters can kill knights.   Knight PVPing Strategy   Nothing is impossible in ragnarok, though I must say that hunters are very much overpowered, they can at one time finish off any knights that have very weak defense as they use the hit and run technique, in this case, the knight's best friend is the spear boomerang and a hell lotta dex. Using a 4 slotted pike with appripriate cards, the knight can also dish out alot of damage. Also, the knight is one of the classes that can reach over 14,000 max hp, now thats alot! Then, they also have something that hunters don't have, mad defense, and a shield. Using proper cards to suit his needs, a knight can easily reduce the damage of a hunter by alot! At the same time they can also dish out alot of damage.   Wizard PVPing Strategy   Wizards, probably one of the most famous classes in RPG games. With powerful magic they can most probably kill off their opponents in one blow. The favourite fast killing strategy for wizards is probably the Frost Diver/Jupitel Thunder combo. However, this method is becoming more and more known to people and people have deviced plans to dispose of wizards. What I can say is use your own knowledge and skill to come out with strategies for PVPing with wizard. Remember if u firewall someone they would be jammed for around 1 second without being able to move because of the lag and the knockback.   Hunter PVPing Strategy   Alright, we come to the most favoured class in RO, also the most overpowered. I personally don't like hunters alot because I refer to them as cowards, in other games archers and hunters are alright, but not in RO, they are clearly overpowered and the fact that most of their attacks are ranged makes it even tougher for meelee classes to crush them. With the hunter, PVPing is fairly simple, use double strafe, if the enemy gets too close use charge arrow and repeat. If the enemy gets too close however get ready for a world of pain as knights usually have high dex. Dagger sins can also be a pain if you don't know what to do. Their superb dodge can render ur double strafe and charged arrow useless. Do not fret, the hunter is also given a sidekick, the falcon. With blitz beat hunters usually kill assassins with no trouble at all.
