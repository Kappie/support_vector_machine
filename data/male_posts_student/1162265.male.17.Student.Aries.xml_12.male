The speaker was pretty good, but the food at Casta Del Soul sucks, since all the NCNW women are so delicate, they couldn't eat anything with salt, sugar, probubly vitamin A, and if it was a vegetable it was bad to.  So, it ends up we get like an English serving of potatoes, the driest piece of beef, two turkey sausages and nasty powder tasting eggs.  The speaker made up for this though, because the way she talked really played to my emotions, especially talking about the child abuse cases.  A suprising lack of talking about the war, even though she alluded to that, since all people are thinking about that now.  In the spirit of that, I found the funniest quiz on Quizilla, that needs to be more popular.    you are the ultimate homey. you're so black. mMmMm KFC. keep it real nigga. holla.    urlLink      `?!?!?!HOw BLACK are yOu?!?!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
