The blighter was facing away, all I recognized was a fruity colour. Down it went. Down to the hatch it went. Your hand prods through and grapples away. I snatch at my treat and pull it away.  Cherry Chewits. You get a dozen or so little squares, all individually wrapped, all annoyingly well wrapped. I was dithering away, unsuccessfully unwrapping, trying my utmost to unravel the treat. Scrape I did, scratch I did. To no avail. With the clock ticking and brake time ending, desperation struck. The irremovable became the resident coating. Have you ever eaten cherry-paper goo?  Not only had I consumed a fraction of the coniferous Nordic forest, but to add a stinging insult to the grievous injury, I was left sticky fingered in Asda, without sink or soap.  No use pretending to be a kid. Boycott Chewits.
