Neither side conceited any tries... 6-3... I have never seen a closer game in my life, not even in the world cup... We were there, cheering our lungs out... Rooting for all of the Rafflesians on the field...  Never have i seen such passion and drive... The rafflesian spirit was truly present on the field... I have always known the passion and drive ruggers have for Raffles, and i am truly honoured to have witnessed it first hand... This is truly the embodiment of the rafflesian spirit...  This is the true soul of Raffles... This is what sets Raffles out from the rest... No one else can boast such passion and comaradarie... Hear the Raffles Roar, and let the world tremble before us...   To all ruggers:  You guys are the champions... It was truly an honour seeing you guys playing in the field... As ben said... This is the stuff dreams are made off... And all of you have truly immortalised yourselves in the annals of the histroy of RJ... And i personally will never forget may 26, the day i saw Raffles triumph against all odds... We are truly the premier institute in Singapore...  Auspicium Melioris Avi A Hope For A Better Age Never before had these words held more meaning...
