Just spent an hour on the phone with Hum. Crash course for current affairs. Hum's really smart. He's terribly funny too- in a vulgar sort of way... He cracks me up.  This is the stage they start to whack us with their questions. Although we're expected to know SOMETHING, I don't suppose they'll place heavy weightage on that particular aspect. What I THINK they ARE looking for, is the ability to pick ourselves up when we fall during the interview. It's like war.  I hope God will be my guide. Guide of my actions and tongue. I'm not sure if He'll help me. I mean it. I haven't been very good this week and I'm feeling afraid.  I'll wash my face, pray the serenity prayer and I'll go to sleep.
