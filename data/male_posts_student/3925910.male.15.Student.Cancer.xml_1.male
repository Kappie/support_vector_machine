Well anyways, time to get started on this diary, i'll start my write up about my life everyday!  Today, Man, school blows, so much homewoek hand in due tomorrow, i don't think i can finish it all on time, man they gotta change the study policy here in Singapore, we need maths for everywhere we go -.-||... well, life's tough, we all gotta live life to the full, imma get into some trouble and start the thrill of teachers scoldin me, cya sometime soon!  -Mel   Ragnarok Thoughts  For those of you who dunno what RO is, its an MMORPG made my Gravity, a Korean company that makes games. www.ragnarokonline.com I'll be writing on this game as I go along...  The Real fun of RO, is probably coming up with whacky builds to rock people's minds and freak them out. I mean, whats the fun of playing a game that has everyone the same for a certain class, it'd be boring wouldn't it, so peeps started coming up wid weird builds like the Agility Knight, or the Vitality Assassin, theres even the Meelee Priest build! Looking at all these builds im inspired to play RO, where every character is different and they all have their strengths and weaknesses, working together while improving the strengths and covering up the weaknesses, thats the true fun of ro, well at least to me.
