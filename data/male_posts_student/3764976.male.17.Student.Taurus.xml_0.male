Pembroke Academy is known overall to have poor sportsmanship in the athletics area. Well, I recieved a letter from the Don of the team, Mr. Doherty, with some good news. We had been awarded the Class L Sportsmanship Award for the 2004 season! Hey, we're the only team that actually won something! You all suck now because of this. There is a new movie coming out called "sleep over" or something like that. In the background near the end of the TV promo you hear a song with the line "Break out today!" Well, for those of you who don't know who it is, it's a band by the name of Allister and the song is called Stuck. This movie has ruined their careers not only because the song is in it, but they are in the movie as well...this sucks ass. I still love them though. Too bad the teeny boppers won't know that they are raging alcoholics who love to play stupid games when drunk. Oh yeah, summer sucks so far and it can fall off a cliff of blah right about now. Later.   Music Playing Currently: Avenged Sevenfold-Unholy Confessions
