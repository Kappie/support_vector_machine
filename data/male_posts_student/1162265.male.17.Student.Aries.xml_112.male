You who deny me, confess me,  and you who confess me, deny me.  You who tell the truth about me, lie about me,  and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me.  You who know me, be ignorant of me,  and those who have not known me, let them know me.   For I am knowledge and ignorance.  I am shame and boldness.  I am shameless; I am ashamed.  I am strength and I am fear.  I am war and peace.  Give heed to me.  I am the one who is disgraced and the great one
