The other night we had to call our ultimate frisbee game before it was over because we saw lightning (we were down 9-7 at the time). This was not unexpected. But walking to the car, the heavens opened up, and trying to drive home I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, due to the sheets and sheets of rain pelting my windshield. The situation was made more complicated by the fact that one of my teammates was waiting for her boyfriend to show up, so we spent the next 45 minutes driving up and down the street next to this park, trying in vain to look for something that looked like his car, dodging tree branches and lakes in the middle of the road. Eventually we contacted him. He was at home. He tried to come to the game and gave up. Smart man.  And for the past week and a half, on all of the local TV stations there has been that little icon in the corner telling some of the viewing public that their area might be hit with a severe thunderstorm, flood, or tornado at any second. It's like code orange for weather.
