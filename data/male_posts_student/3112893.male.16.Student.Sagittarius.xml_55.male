I felt kind of bad though not doing anything music-wise, so I thought of songs and this is just the first one that came to mind. I looked for the tabs and figured out how to play it, so here it is. It's pretty simple, but still :-).  As usual, leave guesses in the comments, and please guess even if someone already has put what you think is the right answer or wrong answer or whatever. Just say hi, even.    urlLink
