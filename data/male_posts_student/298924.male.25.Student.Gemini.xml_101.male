There is a problem here people....I recognized it though....I'll fix it....give me time....I'm not a bad guy, just lazy....  Anyways I know I said in an earlier post I was going to talk about my new love of ties....well I changed my mind....just don't feel like it anymore....  Let's talk about this whole daylight savings time concept....this is really screwing up my internal clock....instead of merely losing an hour I am sleeping like crazy....I actually woke up around five am and then went back to sleep and COULD not wake up....I hit my alarm clock violently when it went off at 7:09 or whenever and proceded to sleep until 11:15 or so....I gotta get it together though cuz tests are coming....  Another good episode of the Cosby Show came on Nick at Nite last night....this time Cliff's father and his two friends (one being the dude from Herman's Head....remember that show???) came over to play Pinochle....TREEEE-mendous comedy....the subplot involving Vanessa's date was classic....the lil dude was funny, although watching it now he seems a little....umm...non-heterosexual...."Is that all Dahsta Hustable???".....hilarious!!  Anyway....I gots to do better...no more missing class for any reason!
