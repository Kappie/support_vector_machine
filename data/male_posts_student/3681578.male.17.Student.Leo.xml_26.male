Fil 11...sucks...well, last time it didn't really...siguro because we had a faster pace in the discussion of poems...okay, I'll go Filipino...um, tula...and I exerted an effort to answer his questions a lot of times...talk about active participation...kasi the thing about Salazar I hate is when he tries to extract all the aspects of panitikang tradisyunal from the tula at hand...like trying to get the monarchical power distribution from the tula Para sa may mga Anak na Dalaga...I mean oh come on...yes, the economic, catholic, and other structures are there but like trying to get orange juice from grapes...  Anyway...Risci feels kinda stupid now we are not there...Booty (our former Research teacher) is still the research teacher of seniors...However, the juniors have a new research teacher...Aragoza, I'd daresay Keith's favorite panelist...*note the hint of sarcasm*...anyway...there...  Oh and there is a new system for research na rin...um, the junior had to defend um, three titles and the panelists had to choose the best title from the three...talk of stupid...unlike in the first three batches of Risci graduates where there was diversity in topics...all researches that I saw now are about cream for ganyan ganyan sakit...remedy/cure for this...endless applications of garlic to human health...oh come on...talk about improvement huh?!  at least during those times, there were researches in physics, chemistry, materials science and others...ok, its not that deep...but at least there is the effort to...you get the point...  I do hope that some Riscians stumble upon my blog...they will find it nice reading...  Um...I'll try to wrap up my ADS essay na ok? so...  bye!  mwah!
