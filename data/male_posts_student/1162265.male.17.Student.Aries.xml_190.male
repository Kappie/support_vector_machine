So just like pork this is another chapter in the book of life that I'm ending early.  Really, it's a bad idea.  I don't agree with it being illegal, but I don't want to become considered in that verse of "Giants Vs. Giants"  'The drugs, the cocaine, the white man bring, make a brain go insane, and that's another black down the drain' I really do need to look at that.  I remember talking with a guy on the DPZ board who said something about how he's keeping his body and mind pure for "da war" and "da coming stormz".  I thought that was pretty true, maybe I can dig up what he said.
