According to www.dictionary.com, a computer is "A device that computes, especially a programmable electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."  According to Rich, a computer has three integral fucntions that ensure the survival of man and ensure that men have a good time whilst alleviating boredom: CHAT/EMAIL, PORN and MP3S. In this post, I will outline how these 3 facets of the computer are the most principle of it's existence, and why this post is no way whatsoever demoralising women, defamation is not my contention for such a post. Any chances of male chauvinism will be eradicated upon request and this blog will be deemed unfit for a woman to read.   CHAT/EMAIL: Email, an electronic medium of communication between two or more parties, with communication being the transfer of information, ideas and feedback in order to reach a certain destination or accomplish a certain goal. [Nick Korfiatis, Business Management 34, 2004]. This is some what a plausible definition for chat/email.However, we must divulge the benefits and disadvantages of email, although right now I don't see any disadvantages. One benefit, is that it saves money. Why waste 40 cents on a phone call, or waste 15 cents for 30 seconds [depending on your operator], plus a 25 cent flagfall, when you only have to say one thing? The money can be more usefully disposed. Perhaps a fork or straw at the Haileybury canteen? Also, are you able to share English essays, or Chemistry Prac Reports over the phone? I dearly think not. Without email, people like John Hak or Peter Tao would be deprived of their homework sharing services. As you can see, chat/email serves as a great medium for communication, and is great for those assignments due the following day, in an attempt to escape the wrath of detention.  PORN: Ahh.. porn. Porn can actually be a great thing for everyone to enjoy - IF the stereotype and stigma placed upon it as a burden is removed. How is everyone supposed to enjoy porn if we are denied mainstream access, or if there is such negativity towards it? If it is perfectly fine for two ladies to indulge in the pleasures of physical and sexual attraction, then why is not perfectly fine for us to see it? And why is there such a commotion about female homosexuality anyway? If they enjoy it, and want the world to see it, then by all means let them! Come on! Oh, and what about this "what if my kids see it?" business? Well, referencing my last English essay on cencorship - "Children who are exposed to reality instead of living a life full of fantasy learn a far better lesson from a computer or television, a lesson that far exceeds what is being taught in the classroom." In saying that, I don't mean that we should let them see "Debbie does Dallas" instead of teaching them how the uterus is stimulated by the penis. If we prohibit access from them, it will only make them more curious to explore its greatness. If a child is able to procure porn, they will be ready for their first experience when they are older, no need to search for that dreaded "World of Science" textbook that was so unsatisfactorily taught by Ms. Crook in Year 7.  MP3S: What can I say about mp3's. Well, it saves money. Why would you spend $25 dollars on a CD when you can download it? "Oh but what about the cover? And Lyrics?" Well, a quick "Google it" [another benefit of a computer - no need to travel to a library to find ONE book out of MANY on anything] can find discography's which readily stock front and back covers of the original cd, and www.lyricstime.com provides a good source for lyrics so you can sing to the music.  Well there you have it. I think it is clear that the main functions of a computer are not viable without the use of "Internet". This very clever creation has most definitely improved the lives of many around the world, mentally, physically, socially, spritually and sexually.
