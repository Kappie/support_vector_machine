Because I feel that some of the things that have been happening in my life must remain a little more personal. It is true that the blog is an excellent way of therapy, but sometimes I think that exposure is not so good, and could tamper with some of the relations I have, specially the one that matters the most... How? Well, this is a no holds back zone, so I might get sometimes too emotional or too cynical about matters that only concern a couple of persons: Adrian and me. So when I write here, it only shows my side, only shows what I think without even having a discussion with him about the situation or the problem or the feeling, so I don't get, most of the time, his feedback. That's why I'll try now not to get both sides of my life involved: the blog and my boyfriend.  It's been a great ride... But I should hold back some information. It's the natural thing to do. Just one thing before I go and take the new turn on this blog:  Is it normal for me wanting to be with him all time, all day? Is it normal for me loving someone so much that I could do is think and think on him? Is it normal for me wanting to call him all time? Is it normal for me aching for a phone call I know lately I haven't gotten? Is it normal for me hating this distance between us during the day? Is it normal for me feeling good and relaxed every time I see him?   I think and I think and think and think, and it all comes the same:  I love him with all my heart.   Now I am a pessimist, is in my nature, I worry, I cry, I get depressed... But I feel that he loves me, that's why I better focus on it. I'll try to hold back a little bit and give him a little more space, not that I am on his case all day, I just barely see him and I talk to him... But still... I don't want to .... See the pessimist and worried side of my personality was taking over... He's great.. It all comes to that!  Today is our month anniversary... I'm such a girl... I feel I'm in high school...!!!  ... I think Rebecca knows about me... She knows but she just doesn't say a thing... I hate that... I'm better on written words than on spoken ones... So as I know you know, just let me know you know, so I can say: "I knew, you knew..."   'Cause Becky, you are my friend and I care for you... as I know you care for me... I love you girl!
