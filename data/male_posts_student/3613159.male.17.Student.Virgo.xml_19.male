The second is the zine I'll be woring on this summer. I'm not quite set on a title. Two options are "Stay Free" and "One of These Days." I suppose that they might be horrible but I'll have fun writing them and trying to get people to read them. Other than that I have an early morning headache and everyone has vanished from my house. I wish my dad played the trumpet.
