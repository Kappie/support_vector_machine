Yeah. let me proceed to talk about yesterday.    Saturday   Yes! The SYF Opening Ceremony. All of us are going.  Okay. I woke up at 6, in order to do the Time Race quiz! Wow! I had fun doing them. I felt so confident! I hope my team gets into 2004 year safe and sound! Yes! Even ducks meowed!   Okay. I then met my team. We are planning to visit the primary schools to ask for permission to do surveys in their school. Heh. Most of the schools lie on the 98 bus route line, so it is darn convienent. Most of the schools are so friendly, especially Lakeside's vice-principal. So friendly! Some school's principals are not present, so we have to leave our particulars with the schools. Well, generally, we kinda succeeded. Yep. :)   Then I went to meet CQ and Gloria. Yeah. Lets skip the meeting process short and letys just say all of us met at Lot 1 at 12.35. Ayioh!!! Foodcourt is so full, and so are the fast food restaurants. We just have to ta bao our food back to PJ to eat lor. I 'da pao'ed chicken rice. I am damn hungry...and my stomach is hurting. It has been 6 hours since I ate.   Okay. We ate. Yes! We waited for the rest at the concourse. Heh. In the end, there were only 3 tables of choir members. Ain't that pathetic? Heh. They were thinking of skipping, because nobody took attendance. Even the seniors did not come. Sigh. All of us went in the end.  Me and BoonChai sat together. We chatted and chatted. Heh. I helped him do survey on accidents. What a cool survey. I chatted with him non-stop. What good chemistry between us.   Our choir people were talking non-stop. Heh. We passed by lots of school. Mainly primary schools. They were so happy meeting us that they keep waving at us. Heh. We met Admiralty Primary. YAY! Heh Heh.   Well, our bus is hopelessly lost. Well, not really. We have to get into the 'wrong' lane, and in the end, our batch is the last to arrive. We got separated from the rest of the Pioneers. Heh.   Okay. The Opening Ceremony is like a mini-NDP. Sigh. Copycats. Heh heh. No la. The choir put up a good performance. The display band competition is nice. YaY! Tanjong Katong won. What a nice display band! Yes!  Gloria and met met the rest outside the stadium. CQ went to meet his family. We met SL, HL, Joyce, Janet, Vydia and YiJia. Heh Heh. We walked all the way towards Kallang MRT, then we took the train back to Woodlands. We ate dinner there and went back home.  Yes. By the way, nice fashion, Colin. You matured a lot.   Today   Okie dokie. I mainly did my GP homework today. Heh. I finally succumbed to temptation and only did 'an article every 2 weeks' plan. However, I selected good topics like "Gay Marriages" and "Hate Crimes" to write on, so I got lotsa good and insightful comments. Yes! Heh Heh. So I only did 4 articles. Sue me. :P   Yes! That means I completed myGP homework. YAY for me! 1 down, 1 to go. Only MT left! Even the ducks are meowing at XiaoYanZi! Yes!  Okay. Today is that boring. Right. Not really. Dad was home the whole day. Don't want to work today, I guess. Yeah.  I got very very good news. I can't say what. Oh, very good news that is.  Right. I gotta go write the reward challenge for Survivor RPG. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
