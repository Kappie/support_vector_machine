I hope Katie swims this season.  So I rented a ninja game, its called Tenchu: Return of Darkness . It sells itself as a ninja-stealth game, but there idea of stealth is "run through a level killing everyone that you can, and pray to god that you dont get caught" but its fun. There are kills a la  Manhunt . Sneak up behind the soon to be meatbag, hit the attack button, WAAM, that monkeys gone to heaven. The story is weird, your some assasin, who kills people, but only bad people. Oh yeah, and apparently in medieval Japan, the people had a good 10 gallons of blood in them. But I like it so I reccomend you try it.
