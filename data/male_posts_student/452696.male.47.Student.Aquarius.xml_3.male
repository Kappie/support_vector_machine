I'm experiencing lots of trepidation regarding leaving something familiar and walking a different walk, but I have to do it. My head is just not in the game where I'm working now. And if I remained there I'd likely be moving to a position where that could have a negative effect on everyone around me. So, time to let my life unfold before me as the gods (god) intended.  My father's family is gone. Two brothers, two sisters, mother, father, uncles, and of course my dad. All dead now. Just in the last two weeks his two sisters died. One right after the other. Gives one a wierd feeling knowing that there is an end to this life. I hope there is something else afterwards. But as the Scottish proverb goes, "Better enjoy this life while you can, for you're a long time dead."
