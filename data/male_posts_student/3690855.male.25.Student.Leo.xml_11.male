Maybe you is me.  I dunno.  Today's update:  Little Girl is still wildly missed around the house.  She was in her own way such an important part of the house, and I really miss her a lot.  It's not the same without her.  It's difficult adjusting when something has been a part of your life for almost twenty years, and all of a sudden it's just...gone.  And not coming back.  Divorce must be ten times worse.  I'm never getting divorced.  Children leaving the house or dying must be a hundred times worse.  I'm never having kids.  Then again, sometimes I think those things aren't happening whether I want them to or not...  Anyway, other things.  The Benson and Zambrano trades are looking like unmigated disasters.  Bruce Ratner is still a douchebag.  I hope David Stern makes him sell the team back.  Work still sucks, but hopefully I only have a few more weeks of working at Domino's.  Radio show went well today.  Hopefully we can get some guests in there so I can interact with somebody.   With me being unable to take phone calls, I think it really takes away from the atmosphere of trying to do a talk radio program.  I, Robot was pretty good.  Harold and Kumar was pretty mediocre.  And I think that will do it.  Take care, invisible blog reader.
