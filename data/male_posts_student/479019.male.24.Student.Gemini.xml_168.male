I guess the money is needed.  Something else I want to comment on before I go. Aren't fish in aquariums supposed to be soothing or relaxing? Well... I was in the doctor's office today waiting and there was an aquarium. As I stared at the fish, I found myself getting pissed off rather than feeling relaxed. I guess I was feeling empathy for the fish... I felt frustrated and confined to a pathetic existance. It was a pretty bad feeling. I'm so glad I'm not a goldfish. I don't even like the crackers.  **
