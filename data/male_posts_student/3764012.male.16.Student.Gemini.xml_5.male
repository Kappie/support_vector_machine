Hopefully my determination will reach to the max this week ... i am starting to get back my confidence and my determination is growing stronger day by day ... i have stop thinking of her but more on my studies and expectation , everytime i see her i will get distracted especially with him around .... i will always tell myself "Nelson you can do it , you will be the best , you are the best , you will not rest,dont give up , many people are expecting you to be the best ,you can do it you can do it , dont give up dont give up etc etc" i will keep on repeating this phrases in my mind until i am totally focus and determine ,hope this can work ,at least it did help me a little to forget about her ...but truthfully i still like her but what is more important is my studies and future ... i cannot ruin my future just like this ... for some things 1 chances is given ONLY and this chances ,once you lose it you cannot get it back anymore so NOW i cannot lose this chance of getting my ass to sec 5 to poly and to university , I cannot let my mother ,brother ,sister , miss tan tm , miss soh , miss koh , miss tan lm , mr tan and all those teachers who have thought us down , i really cannot disappoint them ... they put in effort to teach us i will put in effort to show them results ... all of them gave me a high expectation i will return them my high stnadards !!! NElson CAN DO IT !!! NELSON WILL NOT GIVE UP !!!! ~~~~ !!!
