Well, we started school yesterday. No real fun in that. It's pretty simple so far though. I hope it stays that way. Today was pretty average in itself. I did get to talk to Bon again. I guess that's the third day in a row, now. It most likely won't stay that way, though, unfortunately. But yeah. School was pretty strait forward today too. No real news. Well, I think I'm going to go because I don't have anything else to say.
