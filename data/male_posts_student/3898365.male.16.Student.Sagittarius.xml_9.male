We were supposed to draw just an unrealistic face and then embellish it over and over and make things darker and lighter and so on and so on. I got a little carried away and ended up changing the nose on my face into an elephant's trunk and drawing the ear that was visible into a large elephant ear. Then we had to post what we had so far up on the walls, and everybody else's looked realistic, and there was mine with cartoony eyes and an elephant's trunk. It was pretty awkward. So I dropped my pants and started dancing on a table while singing "The Lady is a Tramp." That took away the attention from my drawing. And it showed them all my exquisite singing skills.   But we got to look at other charcoal drawings and go back and edit our own to make it look more realistic. I think I did okay. It looked human, at least. I was really proud of the nose, but I spent way too much time on it. Natalie's drawing was so crazy good and dark and amazing. She's gonna do good if she sticks with art in her future.   Oh, but on the last day of Ecology class in a conversation with Mr. Gilford, I told him about how I was taking the drawing class in a studio on Division, and he told me that he knows of the place because he lives in the area. So who did I run into after I walked out the door today? Mr. Andrew Gilford. It was neat neat neat.   That Six Flags commercial with the dancing old guy creeps the hell out of me. If you saw a guy like that dancing in front of a bus and beckoning you to hop on, why the hell would you? You're just asking to be raped, my friend. Raped with a fist. An old, wrinkly fist.   Ciao.
