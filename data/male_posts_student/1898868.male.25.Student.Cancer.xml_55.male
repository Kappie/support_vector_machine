Can someone tell Stick that I no longer need to speak with him? It seems as though I can just as easily get my Stick updates via Shafer/Bagel/Silver Steve/John Kerry/Al Sharpton, etc. Rev. Sharpton can tell me more about Abbott's diabolical plans or living with Stick's girlfriend in Boston. Stas, despite HIPAA violations, I'd enjoy hearing about your wacked out patients. I was with another asperger's pt several weeks ago and this kid was amazing.
