The script's coming along...I hit the end of Act I on my outline, and I know what is going to happen next...but I just - can't - write - it - for - some - reason.  Evan was complaining about this in Math...he'll know the answer, know how to get there, and just doesn't have the fortitude to make it happen.  He thought it was a problem only genius recluses with a bend for the number  i  had.  But the Rumplestilsken whose currency is the trade of ideas, and who tries to spin the ideas into gold, it's the name of my life.    Writing's not hard.  It's not a hard life, I should say.  The process is a fucking bitch.    And this isn't meant to be a complaint session, as I love few things more than opening up the laptop and feeling the fingers go at 90+ words a minute, flying without me needing to look down at them...the aptitude counselor at Chaparral Elementary School told my parents to get me a computer when I was 7 or 8, because he said my mind moved so quickly that I couldn't keep up on paper, owing to my poor motor skills...a computer would allow me to work at a pace more condusive to my mental temprement.  And I love it.  Just opening the blog, I looked forward to writing it, because I would be writing...and the thing is, I'm writing right now...writing an outline for a script I've debated since before I left Centenary.    The job trade is starting to rear its ugly head.  And I don't want to talk about it.  How's that for telling?    I need a breakthrough on the script.  Had one last night, so I shouldn't try to dip in the celestial waters so often that their mystical abilties become the norm and I can't survive without drenching my manner in the pool.  But it'd be nice to have an outline by Friday, throw it to Bobby Fosh, and get writing again.    I wouldn't mind being in love again, either.
