Because of this, he has pasty skin, and the little hair that he has is fluffy like feathers. To the children, he is a scary ghost that has been haunting the house. They think that his body is stuffed up the chimney, explaining why they never see him, but he is really alive, just shy and doesn’t want to come out of the house.  He doesn’t have much of a relationship with others, as he never gets out of his house, and not much is known about his relationships with his family. We do know, however, that he is courteous to those that he does see on odd occasion. We know this because Miss Maudie tells Scout that he “spoke as nicely as he knew how”. Also, this is proven by the way that he acts towards Scout when they finally meet, towards the end of the book.  Boo’s role in the novel is that of the misunderstood person. Because of Boo, we learn that one should not judge someone on their appearance – or in this case lack of appearance. We also learn that one should not believe everything they hear.  Boo’s qualities are generosity, kindness and also timidity. He portrays enerosity by leaving presents for the children, even though they are scared of him. He portrays kindness by the way that he talks to Miss Maudie and the way he treats Scout and Jem. He portrays timidity by the way that he never goes out in public.
