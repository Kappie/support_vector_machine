Twenty-five former National Guard soldiers and 171 former Army members in Louisiana will be notified, some as early as Tuesday, that they are to report for active duty within 30 days, said Andrea Wales, spokeswoman for Army's Human Resources Command in St. Louis.  - urlLink Associated Press .  I've mentioned the involuntary call to service before, but now that it's actually happening, it seems much worse. It's like we're that much closer to a draft.
