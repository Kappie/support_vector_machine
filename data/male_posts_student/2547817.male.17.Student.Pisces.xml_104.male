Will talk to Sidney (Who is coincidentally the brother of Pastor Malcom Tan) and find a voice coach... I have to. Can NOT screw up this one. It'll be the end of me.  I went to watch the SYF Drama production. Brilliant. What can I say? Nothing short of brilliant. Mrs Geetha Creffield is a genius (and it's not like I haven't said it before). I really look forward to working under her. You know, I almost felt proud. OK...OK... I felt proud of something that belonged to ACJC. There! I said it. Even as the crew set up the stage, WOW! MAN! WOWWWWW!!!! They worked fast, They worked precise. Beautifully done. The crew's work was art too. The acting was good on the most part. Few accents were REALLY off, but that's ok... a few actors were a bit... um... trying to be actors? I don't know how to put it.  I shan't say any more coz I'm not sure if I could do any better. But in the event I can't I'd really like to learn. I've just realized that by saying that, it's humility. Urgh... I think it's a good thing, but I really don't want to loose my charisma. Will really have to sit down and think about what I want to become. A product is out of the picture.  Oh one more thing, TJC's was good, though I didn't really fancy it. HOWEVER, I really have to take my hat off to M.I. Simple play, no fancy smoke machines or lights at all. Just some furniture and the only sound effect was that of a knocking mortar thing, and even that was "home-made". But there was this girl who pulled off the funny old lady REALLY RREEAALLLLLYYY WELL. It was very good.  Signing off. oh wait... Thanks to Cheam and Leon. Who needs girls when you've got boys like these... Interpret that in any way you please to amuse yourself.
