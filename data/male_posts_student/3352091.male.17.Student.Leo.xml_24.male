I was always on the brink of waking up at the slightest noise or movement, like a soldier on the battlefield. Then around 7:30 am the words "Awake You" flashed red on a black background. very unerving. If anyone feels they know what this means please email me or give me a comment because this is really making me think and wonder. Was it just my biological clock or was it a hint into something deeper in my mind?
