I'm quite certain I just ruined any miniscule chance I had with who is quite possibly the nicest, smartest, most beautiful girl in the world. Why? Because I pursued an issue I shouldn't have. It would've kept me from sleeping at night, but I shouldn't have asked her the question I did. It was rude an incondiderate. Don't make the same mistake I did, because no one deserves to feel uncomfortable, and no one deserves to feel as bad as I do, even though I earned it myself. Don't follow in my footsteps. Don't screw with your own head because of someone you're quite certain you need. Please.
