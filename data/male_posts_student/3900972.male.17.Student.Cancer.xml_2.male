Or people on the forums going "HaHa pWn on u" or "I R so L337".    God that pisses me off   Why cant people just use normal, correct English like a normal human beeing, just say "Heh, it would seem i have beat you" rather then goin "HAH I R pwned u n00b!". Its not that hard for christ sake.  They even made their own language to piss me off even further, i believe its called "L337"and it goes something like this "1 4|\/| 7|-|3 83$7" wich means "I am the best", people who use that should just die and burn in hell.  In short, if you use internet slang whenever im around, i'll castrate you with a spoon. As a closing i have included a litle file for all to see, the file can be found  urlLink here
