I clicked on it thinking it would be shit, but this game is amazing.  Ok, you make your own punk music from a selection of sound clips (good clips).  You choose what the drums do and what two guitars do. (No bass, but hopefully this guy will make another one with bass in it).  If you are a guitar player you will see how in-depth it is.  The characters playing your music don't just move repititionally, they move to the chords you hear in each clip.  Plus, after you are done, you can save your songs and also share them.  Here are two songs I did, all you need to do is hit the 'load' button, and put one of these in the space provided:  Song 1:   --680---0---6-5-5-5-573---9-5-9---9-6-0---0---2---2--701280---0---9---9--------------1---1---1-----------6-5-5-3-3-4---4---0---0---2---2-------1---1---a---c------------------3-3-2-4---3-3-2-4-3-3-5-4-a-------3-3-2-4-a---a-------3-3-2-4-a---a--------------  Song 2:  780---0--73---3--80---0-6-9-----6-1---1---6-9------------------------------------------9---9---a---a---9---0---------6-9---9---a-c------------------------------------------6-5-6-5-a-------6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-a-a----------------------------------------   Also while you create your songs, the game plays bands like Lagwagon, NOFX, and Bad Religion in the background.  This will definitly keep you busy when you are bored.  This has to be the most in-depth music generator I played online.  Besides that, nothing much has been going on.  I have a feeling Ben doesnt really want to do the band anymore.  I am desperate to get there and just have some fun.  I have been trying for years to get a band started.  I put a flyer up in Joe's Music advertising myself.  Hopefully something will come up.  I need something to do in my free time. And I have been wanting to do this for a long time.  I got alot of homework to do :( My mom wants me to do all the asignments i was too lazy to do :( I have to make up like 8 assignments in History...Damnit...  I'm at my dad's, this is the only place I can blog now with my madre's computer fucked up. So I havent been able to blog in awhile.
