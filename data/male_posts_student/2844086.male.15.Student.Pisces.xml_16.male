And I so don't want to go to school tomorrow. I'm just sick of it.  I don't feel God today. Why I don't know. I didn't go to church, but that's never hendered His presence from me. I'm sure he's here though. Sometimes we just can't feel God even when He's right there. But I long to feel him.  A good song is "In the Secret" by Sonic Flood. I'll post some of the lyrics.   I want to know you/ I want to hear your voice/I want to know you more/ I want to touch you/ I want to see your face/ I want to know you more   So anyway I guess I'll stop here.
