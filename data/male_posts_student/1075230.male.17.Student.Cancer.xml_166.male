Unwelcome Intruder   I probably would've been asleep by now if my dad didn't open the door for 5-10 minutes with his questions about blah and blah useless crap about moving the computer to such an illogical location that all I could do there was lie there dumbfounded at why he would bother me at that time for that subject.   Home Aint Where My Heart Is...   He goes on to say, "You're not going out tomorrow."  A straight rejection of the proposal I had previously requested earlier on in the night.  An answer so blunt and late at night that all I could do was again lie there, dumbfounded at why he says this now.  My head hurts and my eyes hurt as I sit here wondering how I will be able to sleep and wake up on time during the school year and how soon the carpal tunnel sydrome I'm giving myself with bad posture will kick in.   Sleeping Potion #9   A few minutes ago I was in the kitchen due to the sound of water running through taps annoying me enough to stand and walk.  I warmed up half a mug of warm milk.  Apparently that's supposed to help people sleep and I thought "*shrugs* what the hell."  Note that I didn't actually shrug, I just thought the word.  I'd blame it on the time if I didn't do similar actions when I was fully awake.  *sigh* (yes, I sighed in Real Life)   Turn That Frown Upside Down!   Let's look at the good side: if I'm up in an hour and fourty-one minutes I'll be able to see Naruto.  I wont  want  to watch Naruto, heck I don't want to watch Naruto  now , but the fact that it's only 44% done and it only needs one hour and thirty one minutes (it changed) is a globally life-giving wonderful-amazing event, no?   Sigh...   *sigh*  I guess I'll be trying that "sleeping" thing again.  If it doesn't work, I'll see if I can come back.  *shrugs* (no, I didn't sigh in Real Life)  Or maybe Mr Radio can help me out.  I'd use the phone if not for three reasons,  1. Don't want to wake people and refuse them the privilages of sleeping.  2. Don't have energy to do more than sit and stare, or lie and stare.  3. Don't have access to a felly-tone without parents noticing and angering.  Well...  this is me stalling again.  I will no longer waste the time of your precious three day weekend.  Last weekend before school starts... *sigh*  -ArV   PS - I finally heard an actual "broken telephone" style rumour.  I heard from *** that they were informed by *** who was told by *** that *** would be coming to Mary Ward because *** wrote a two-page essay for that one person.  Hey...  We were going to do a powerpoint presentation for Vick's parents...  I don't remember why we didn't...
