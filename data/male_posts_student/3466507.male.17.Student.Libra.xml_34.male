I get it all the time, which is why I am so aggressive and fast when it comes to picking the teams.  Well, it happened to me again today. I actually chose a group already but a girl had her own group comprising of the same people I have chose. I was conveniently not in her list, not through any fault of hers, of course, because she did not call me to join the function this Saturday. It could have been considered a community project. Too bad that she already had ten people in her group then, all of whom she invited(I assume) to the function. I was at the meeting yesterday. She didn;t see me? Was she blind? (Sorry for blasting her, I think she is innocent.. :S )  Another team actually wanted me, but in the end they decided to pick their own classmates. This is understandable, and my friend (Kevin) need not have apologised so much too me. It kinds of make me feel ashamed, heehee.  In the end, I managed to get into the same group as my classsmates(woohoo?). Well, I wanted to work with soe new people, but I guess I am stuck with them,not that this is anything bad, i just wanted to work with some new people and know them better(besides being able to skip the project, since the function this Saturday is considerd a community project, but I'll still be there, I promised them). Let's just wait and see what community project my classmates select.
