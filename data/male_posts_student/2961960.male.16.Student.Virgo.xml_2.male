I couldn't agree with Google more on the fact that you shouldn't delete any email, rather search for it when you need it.  I think it saves a ton of time trying to organize incoming messages.  Something I would like to see changed is when searching for messages from a specific person.  When composing a new email there is a nice auto-complete that tries to complete the address of the person you are sending the message to.  I'm not sure why this isn't in place when searching.  To me it would make sense since GMail is already aware of everyone you have sent/recived messages with.
