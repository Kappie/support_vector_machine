Despite claims of a new graphics engine, the visuals in Hitman: Contracts remain largely similar to its predecessor; thankfully its credit to that title, that they still look impressive. Following the change to a darker style, the locations you’ll come across are taken from slightly more risqué inspirations then what we’ve come to expect from previous titles such as the Blade inspired fetish club. A handful of new visual effects have been added to the game, particularly in terms of the spraying of blood whenever somebody gets shot. The game also introduces a novel little effect when 47 is on the verge of death, as the action slows down and colour fades from the screen to black and white; the initial impression is quite confusing, as you’re likely to think you‘ve activated some Bullet Time special power – until inevitably you die that is.  Without doubt the strongest aspect of the game lies in the audio stakes as once again IO Interactive have enlisted the assistance of Jesper Kyd, having worked on both Hitman: Codename 47 and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin along with IO Interactive’s other venture Freedom Fighters. The music represents the same change in the look and feel of the game, resulting in a score rife with drum beats and electronic synthesizers – about as far removed from the orchestral soundtrack featured in Hitman 2 as you could expect but equally as good. However it’s not just the music that stands out, as care and attention has been lavished upon every aspect in the sound department, from a variety of voices babbling native dialogue in the background to 47 excellent softly-spoken lines that suit the character perfectly.
