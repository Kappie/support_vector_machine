I love the woman, and as soon as I can figure out how to post a g'damned picture on here, I will put one on here of me and her.  We're pretty close.  Rumor has it, there's a Mason Mebarak Jr. running around out there.  I just saw a preview for the movie staring Matt Dammon and Greg Kinnear called "Stuck on You" about brothers joined at the .. side or something.  What?  Weren't both of those actors kinda good, or at least credited with winning a couple awards here and there?  What I'm trying to say is, shoudlnt Joey Lawernce be in that movie instead of actual credible actors.  Granted, I DID see an episode of Joey.. ahem, sorry.. "Joseph" Lawernce's sitcom on the WB.  Kinda pathetic.  You know those email surveys that you always get from friends that tell you to fill it all out as it pertains to you, and then send it back to your friend and then to all your other friends.  One of the questions is always about who you'd like to have lunch with, dead or alive.  I think I want to meet the creators of the Simpsons, they're just damn funny.  It's clear I have nothing to talk about.  Back to Shakira.  I wonder what she's doing RIGHT now.  She's pretty big on her homeland of Columbia, but I doubt she hangs out there very often now, what do YOU think?  I'm sure the tempting neon lights of Miami Beach just proved to be too tempting.  I need to stop this insanity, I promise I'll be more entertaining at a later date.  Everyone:  remember your earthquake precautions and keep rations nearby.. never know when the next quake will strike the heart of the heartland.  let us NEVER forget the quake of '03.. and the lives it touched.
