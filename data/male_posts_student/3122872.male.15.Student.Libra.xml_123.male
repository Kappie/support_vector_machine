Will probably fail miserably...        *salutes*        Meh...     [UPDATE]  I gave up after nothing worked and I nearly crashed the blog... Something in the Main Posts screwed up the sidebar and pushed it further down the page... I switched to a new unrelated format and it's okay now, the first attempt was Minima Blue, but it had the same problem.
