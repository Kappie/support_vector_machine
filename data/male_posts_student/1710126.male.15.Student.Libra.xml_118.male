Today: a whole pack of diary milk choc but the mini bite size type...and finished bk6. I m starting to scare myself... i dun believe i can finish tt bk so soon. And my poor eyes...and head. Ouch.  whereas for studies? zilch. or so closed to zilch it is indeed zilch.  Not going for choir prac. If they want to they can kick me outta choir. I'll try to join art in jc then. and tt is supposing i made it to rj...  Oh yeah. This is so not worth mentioning...i passed my theory exactly on the dot.  Bah.
