I think first we must have a compulsory rant about how unfair it was:  "BLAH BLAH BLAH REF NEEDS GLASSES BLAH BLAH BLAH GREASY DAGO OILSLICK BLAH BLAH BLAH CHEATING BLAH BLAH BLAH HE WAS OBVIOUSLY BIASED BLAH BLAH BLAH WE WAS ROBBED BLAH BLAH BLAH GREATEST INJUSTICE SINCE MARADONA BLAH BLAH BLAH."  That said, I personally am dreading the events that will take place in two years time. That's right, the World Cup. And not just any World Cup, but the 2006 World Cup. And we all know what 2006 is, don't we, children?  That's right, 40 years from 1966, which is when we won the World Cup. And so, tabloid supporters will work themselves up into a paroxysm of patriotic apoplexy. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be placed under even more media pressure to steer his team to victory. David Beckham will get his mug in the papers even more than he already does. Wayne Rooney will be hyped to the hilt even more than he has been. Pundits will engage in a never-ending barrage of statistic swapping, player rating, and a false sense of importance. "Three Lions" will be re-released yet again, only now it'll be "FORTY years of hurt." It will be fairly safe to say that, at at least one point, the entire hopes and dreams of the English nation will rest on the toes of Michael Owen.   Here's my predictions for the 2006 World Cup:  1. We will get to the quarters, possibly the semis, and then die in flames.  2. This position will not be good enough for the press, who will insist on the resignation of Beckham/Sven/both.  3. It'll all blow over, and we'll be resigned to trying again come Euro 2008.  Oh well.  Football. It's a funny old game.
