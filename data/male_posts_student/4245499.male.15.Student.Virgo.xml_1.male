I read somewhere that sleeping before your usual time of sleep makes sleep worth more. Like if you sleep during the after noon for 3 hours. 20 minutes of sleep during that time is worth 1 hour of sleep during you usual routine. If this is true, we could all save a lot of time. And stay up all night.. doing things... anyways.. my banner rocks. I bet someone we know would be attracted to that sort of thing... *laugh.  I am so hungry I could eat at Arby's... *laughs. So, I microwaved five corndogs.  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
