Now, I laughed as hard as the next guy when Liberal MPs called Martin’s entourage the “ urlLink mistake-a-day-club,” the "no-brainer trust," the B-team, and a bunch of idiots . The dignified and lady-like Carolyn Parrish did these MPs one better by referring to Martin’s coterie as “sneering little, sniveling little shits.” But the mistake-a-day-club has outdone itself thus far in the campaign. Could someone point me toward any positive coverage Martin has received?   urlLink    Keep up the good work, Paul! urlLink     In contrast, Harper’s campaign has been, up until this point, flawless. He received  urlLink great coverage  even in areas that might have been considered hostile up until this point (Quebec and Atlantic Canada).  The next question is: When will mid-campaign polling begin to reflect this?
