shan't have too high hopes...otherwise when the grades are returned...and they turn out to be crap...i shan't forgive myself.hahaha...dunno when i became so disciplined..but ah well...i gotta use time constructively...can't waste anymore time procrastinating and letting indolence take over..ahhh....  okie..hmm..watched house of flying daggers with the chun brothers and hsien ron..haha...was supposed to go with shixian guo jun nic cheng liang angus bk and many more..budden they wanna gl me so i gl them oso lor..hahaha...so ah well...traipsed to cine...wah...the movie's quite lame actually...haha...zhang yi mou's always so determined to enhance the movie aesthetically that certain shortcomings are evident...the characters lacked depth and stuff...and the plot wasn't exactly well developed...however the action scenes were pretty cool la...haha...at least zhang ziyi was worthy of being seen..haha...lol...she got ***** so many times man...lol..i don't mean she looks nice half-naked or wat..but she's really gorgeous..haha...but oh well..on the whole i don't think i wasted 6.50...even though it was utterly illogical at certain junctures...yawnz...  friday was nat. day celebrations..haha..woke up at 5 and started walking around the house...was contemplating whether to go to sch or not..i thought it was quite pointless going to school just for 2 hours and watching some crap performances and returning home soon after...so haha..yea...slept till 8...lotsa ppl called and smsed me sia..dammit...interfered with my repose..hehe...haha thanks to vincent and co they managed to help me take attendance...so i didn't get into trouble..i heard wongsm asked where i was...but luckily vincent said i went to the washroom...lol...thanks lots dudes...hehe...later on nic andy ying quan came over to my house..haha..we watched some stupid mars attacks movie...it's really one of the corniest shows that's graced my eyes man..wth...later on watched matrix revolutions which andy had borrowed from hsien ron...woah...it was really cool watching a second time...haha...all the action was still mind-boggling...totally rocksed man...i love the APUs...ah later on dunno why those peeps kept procrastinating..didn't wanna order pizza hut or anything...since i already had lunch and i was still famished...i ordered pizzas for them...zzz...haha..but i only paid 4 bucks out of 28. ;) haha..but i wolfed down 3 slices...and was kinda full later...soon they left and angy and i played soccer for a while..  saturday...haha...really loooong day...went out to have lunch with 3 of my cousins and my aunt...all of us cousins were from a different family and we didn't have a meal together for a meal in donkey years...so it was really cool...haha..we ate at mezza9 at grand hyatt...woah..the food there is absolutely first-class...it was really delicious..we had soft shell crabs...goose liver...never consumed that before...a martini which we didn't finish..haha...and lotsa other dishes...it was a really fantastic meal..haha..oh yeah...not to mention we met michelle chong there...woah..she's really really tall..haha...but i wasn't exactly full after that..haha..those who know me well know i've sorta got an unsatisfiable stomach.we talked bout the future...very cool man...mimidu who's become such a pretty lady after so many years..haha...has developed a vivacious personality..which is very cool..haha...it was really fun..haha...and we started talking bout religion and stuff...good and evil...yawnz...i was kinda ignorant bout it...so yea..they started talking bout there's a devil in all of us and stuff and i just kept quiet..haha..since i didn't really care...and it didn't really affect me...they sorta had nightmares and stuff...so yeah...they were quite daunted by it...i was like ugh...ok...anything u say...i'm only a little predisposed towards being an atheist so i can't exactly provide much thought ya...so yeah...went for tuition...den went to aunt's house to meet up with the cousins again..haha...talked bout devils and stuff again...yawnz..aunt cooks really well..haha...den we thought of going to watch fahrenheit 9/11..haha..so went off to suntec..wah..lotsa ppl sia...village was sold out as well..i heard there's a really interesting twist at the end of the story...haha..i really wanna watch it...sat in the 4th row from the front..wah...it's really hilarious...haha...i learnt quite alot..but 2 hours is kinda too long for a documentary don't you think..so yea...it was such a long day and my eyes were uncontrollably shutting up...haha...it's quite gruesome...some of the scenes in there...'cos of all the gory scenes of people getting blown up in iraq and stuff...no wonder it's rated nc-16..but i still managed to sneak in..haha...just a couple days more and i won't have to do illegitimate stuff like that..hahaha....reached home at around 1 plus...wah..so shagged man...dad was kinda pissed..yawnz...  sunday was quite typical of a sunday...just bumming and teetering about..yawnz...had to eat this pear my dad offered me...jeez...i think my jaws received adequate exercise for the day while ripping pieces of fruit off the pear man..this makeshift exercise for my jaws effectuated a pretty bloody consumption of the pear...my taste buds detected stints of blood that came with the pear...later on i found out my gums were bleeding..haha...oh well..was fine later...i guess i've grown quite numb to injuries in the mouth hitherto 'cos of the long period of time that i had to live with braces and the numerous operations i had to endure..lol...anw..gotta thank nic and his mum...got me jay chou's new album...it's really cool...hehe...really love some of the songs in there...some of them are actually renditions of reality in my life..haha..geeez...everyone's changing templates...hais..shall change when i feel like...gonna bugger off now after yet another looong long entry..ciao
