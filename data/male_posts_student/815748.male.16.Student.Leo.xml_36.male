Loren did direct me to a quite hilarious site, however (though all of my readers probably already know of it), http://www.homestarrunner.com.  I could write quotes, like Loren did, but it's better to see the 'toons for yo' own self.  Anyone who wants to see a movie over Spring Break (during which I'm doing hardly anything), such as Bulletproof Monk, Head of State, or Phone Booth; or wants to play badminton and/or N64, let me know.  Richie/John, if the latter isn't going to Canada, we should play some Monkeyball 2.  If Will McClaughlin ever e-mails me, we will most likely co-sponsor a resolution on the Palestinian question.  This resolution would probably include the creation of a recognized Palestinian state, UN peacekeeper involvement, and enforcement of former Israeli-PLO agreements such as the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements and past UN resolutions.  I strongly urge any Model UN readers to sign this presently-theoretical resolution once it is written.  If Ian reads this blog, thank you again for recommending "1984."  An excellent read.  I'll leave you, albeit hypocritically (see second paragraph) with this message:  "ARE YOU ASKING FOR A CHALLENGE??!!!!"
