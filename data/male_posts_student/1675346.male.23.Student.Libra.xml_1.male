Also my writing skills are greatly hit and damadged since I've been hitting backspace too many times for last two lines. Plus my roomate is listening Led Zeppelin right now. I somehow have the feelin', "yeah baby give me the feelin", that I'll turn all this noise off. Hats off to mr. Hell, a little bit crude, I once felt Fisherspooner and other folks but still, he's OK. Or maybe it's the second hand smoke, who knows. In the end I went back home with my pal Dora, and we ate 2 sandwiches, and to hell with diet! I'm off to sleep, tomorrow it's either JSP or SQL, all day long. (Unless I have a hangover)
