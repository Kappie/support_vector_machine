         This may look a little dumb, and its near the summer holidays but I thought using a weblog (blog) would be a great way to keep in touch with you and let you know what is going on form back in sunny Norfolk. In this log we (being just me at the moment but it will increase)will write down the weekly, daily, or monthly goings on around here and they will be published on this site to which you can access from anywhere. I intend to keep this updated whilst your in Scotland as a means of constant contact because frankly this year I have barely emailed you and when I have they have been short and crap - sorry about that. Once you have seen this site could you email me (telling me you have) and I will give you the means in which you can post responses on here. 
  Anyway exams are looming on Monday, though thankfully it's my last week of them and then I will be free for the summer. I presume you also have exams coming up next week and I wish you the best of luck with them (I know you'll do great). 
  It was my birthday last week, as you know (thanks for the card) and we managed to have a weekend of partying with a film (day after tomorrow) then a small Aylsham gathering on the Friday and then a college gathering on the Saturday at a resturant and then a pub (of course), so all in all it was great and I got to see nearly everyone even at short notice. I hope we can do something similar for your birthday.
  When do you get back then, I can't wait to see you, we have a lot of catching up to do as we didn't see each other last time, (and we have to make that gangster film still). Anyway I really must get back to my poetry annotations; I hope to see you soon and hope you reply, I will be posting again shortly.
Sailor
