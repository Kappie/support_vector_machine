And my mole was absolutly nothing. Benighn, if you want to say. But she did suggest these pills for my pimples and some exfoliating thing that we didnt buy. Its amazing how if i rant over something like Proactive, it doesnt work and has to be returned. Well, we get our money back for it, and we get to keep the proactiv cuz they dont want it back. So now i get to keep that stuff, and im on a pill. But im not getting my hopes up because if i do, its all over and it doesnt work. That just seems to happen alot.  So, Dreyfoos pissed me off today, cuz i see a letter in the mail from them, and i get all excited cuz i think its my schedule. But its some letter of thanks because my parents donated a couple hundred bucks. I was mad and i threw it on the floor and threatened to quit dreyfoos. But i lied. Because i love dreyfoos.  Yeah, so today wasnt that bad. Another South Florida terrential downpour, but its nice sometimes. Hopefully it wont rain on the first day of school. Yeah, so tommorow is another eventless day, and on Friday, um, the Michael Jackson movie premeires on VH1 and i think im going ot a Marlins game, and then we go into the final weekend before we are launched into the new school year. Ok, well, im tired of typing, and im just rambling now, so lyrics, and goodnight.  Can't say bomb on an Airplayne            Bobby Seifter                              Waking up to an electric timer            It buzzs as you pass                      As you look it in the eye And tell it to die It doesnt listen No it doesnt listen to you                 And you live by these restrictions In a world so full of terror And you tell me what I can and can not do But your just another human No one special, no one fine But we listen to your voice That seems to be better than mine  And when your told what to do                 You feel a pressure to contradict             And as I'm cheating on my girlfriend       While stealing from a store Im screaming bomb on an airplane              You cant stop me anymore  I will loiter and I will liter And Im reading from the bible Cuz what seems like no big deal Has to be taken with procautions Cuz anything can happen But nobody knows for sure (Chorus)  So here i go, past the red light Into a fenced up area from the world And I feel so damn tempted To do what they say to not But I dont
