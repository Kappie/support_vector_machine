The only thing that didnt happen is having sex with Kaworu, and Brian and Michael from QAF. Theres always next week.   Wasn't this just the lamest post ever? I seriously couldn't tell the fun stories that had happened over this week? I mean, look at the stuff! There is some damn cool stuff in there! Argh. Note the foreshadowing of theater developments yet to come. Also, I had both asked Jonathan out and been rejected during this time, which you know, seemed significant at the time. Pff.
