If you read this mate you'll understand why I admire you so much. Firstly Jaap didn't get off to good start against Germany. He shouldn't have got that yellow card at all.  Jaap played fantastic throughout these games, he should have been man of the match too as without him the defense would have been knife through hot butter. I find that Stam during the opening ceremony was solid as he didn't sing but gave a menacing stare, it was great. Should have made the opponents leave cause if you messed with this man you'll wish you hadn't.     Stam had great goal opportunities from his run down centre against Sweden to headers. He inspires me as a defender too as we are the best, no one gets past me, no one gets through Jaap. I too bought a Holland Euro 04 replica orange shirt. I got it customized to say 3 on front and back plus in big letters Stam on back. It's exactly like his and now has become my favourite top ever cause I know a great role model too has one.  Only one things letting me down, I here Stam's leaving international football which will take so long for me to get used to as I mainly support Holland because he plays for them. Another thing which is a shot in the back is him playing for AC Millan. It my be good for him but I wouldn't get to see him as often as it's foreign. I will miss Stam and his perfect footy skills. If he came to Man U or Chelsea I would be very very very happy, he's the world's best defender. Man U needs you back, Ruud and Ronaldo are there too, or even Chelsea where Robben will play.      Quotes by Jaap :   "Ronaldo? He didn't give me any problems."   "Getting rich is not my priority. I always wanted to go to England to play football. I'm coming to United to test myself and win medals. Money comes second after that."   "He's the quickest defender I've ever seen."-Pierre Van Hooijdonk    "It was my way of telling Zamorano that this was my stadium and I wasn't going to budge. I think he got the message."-Stam on his impression of a brick wall against Inter Milan at Old Trafford     If you ever get this message Jaap I hope you understood why I say your my favourite. If I do make it to professional football I'll be using you as my path to success, following in your footsteps (plus when the new Holland shirts come out and you don't play I'll still customize it saying Stam 3 including any club you play for ) Wherever you go you won't let me down !
