You see, on friday I went on a field trip to the Collage of the Canyons.(a community college in Valencia) THEY seemed less stressed out than me.  These are college kids! I guess because they actually get to CHOOSE what classes they want and when to attend. Why can't those of us in lower grades like middle school get to at least choose our class times? I can understand not choosing what classes, but I bet that plenty of teachers( as well as students ) would love to wake up at least an hour later. I know that I don't function well in the morning and would actually prefer a noon class so that I would  at least be awake for school. Now I find myself going kinda down in my grades 'cause( besides being under pressure to keep up my 4.0) I have been told that in my gifted classes, any grade that I get actually counts as one grade higher. so if I get streight b's, it would still be a 4.0 average. I'm willing to get streight b's, but I just feel a duty to myself to keep getting streight a's. That just is tearing me up bit by bit.
