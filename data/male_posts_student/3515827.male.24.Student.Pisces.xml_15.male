The first time I saw this tomfoolery was with the Bible, I'm not sure which version as this was four years ago.  Back then, anyone could log in as the editor or author of the book.  Well, someone logged in as the author Jesus and wrote:   Honestly, not my best work  I know, it's stupid and lame, and doesn't make any sense as Jesus didn't even write the bible.  But I'm easily amused.  But people with too much time on their hands (mostly bloggers I assume) were at it again.  About a month ago they started to do book reviews for My Pet Goat, the book Dear Leader was reading while our nation was under attack.  Here are the  urlLink reviews  Amazon pulled down.
