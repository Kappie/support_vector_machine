Fun how western notions of property ownership trump the environment.    I'm registered to vote in California, an echo to a past that saw me at Berkeley at this point in my life.  So who do I vote for?  I'm not a fan of the recall, so I could vote against that...but then I don't get to vote for pornstars or Arnolds.  But then there's  urlLink Georgy Russell .  I'm fascinated by twentysomethings who run for public office.  And she sells thongs.  And better read on issues than most everyone I've seen so far, sans Cruz Bustamante and Larry Flint.  Why are the porn barons always the smart guys?    If you can find a list of twentysomething candidates, or Cali candidates in general, let me know.
