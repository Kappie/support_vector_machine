I didn't wake up every five minutes with such horrible anxiety attacks, I was able to fall in and out of sleep, unafraid of tomorrow. I'm beginning to feel like me again, something I have been seriously afraid of for the past few days. I still awoke to thoughts of her again. My head is always filled with thoughts and contemplations over her. She is so beautiful, and I wonder if she realizes that! I am constantly struck with these visions of her picture perfect, freckled neck. Something I would seriously like to feel lying under my kisses.
