(i don't believe in selling plasma. god gave me my life for free, what right do i have to turn around and sell it to others). so i get this male nurse that seemed lost and confused as he was doing everything. he ends up missing my vein and jerked the needle around in my arm to find it. that's not the best of feelings. so now my arm is bruised and i'm going to look like a junkie tomorrow. shouldn't i be blessed for doing a good deed?
