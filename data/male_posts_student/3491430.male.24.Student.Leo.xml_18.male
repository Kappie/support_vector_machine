They are newcomers too and very nice.  Liu got a big old TV from a friend, and found a bed in the storage room. So now we have a lot of useful stuff. We watched Eurocup yesterday. It is really a good life with TV. The internet speed is really fast here. We downloaded some movies. I watch 2 movies per day during the weekend. Have a nice summer everyone.
