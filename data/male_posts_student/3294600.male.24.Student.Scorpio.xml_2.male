For whatever reason, she had faith in me.  I don't know, I think she sees potential in me or something.  Especially since I'm taking two classes with her next quarter and I am making her web page for her.  So with about 10-15 minutes remaining in class, she saw I had put it all back together and decided to bring this to everyone's attention.  She found a power supply to turn on the laptop and announced, "Jason's got the laptop put back together, now we're going to test to see if it works."  I turned bright red, she plugged it in, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't actually work.  Everyone applauded, which made me blush but certainly built up my ego.  Jackie, Jerryn (shirt lifter) and I went to the Parks Building and had coffee.  We sat there for a while, but Jerryn wanted to go to the library and Jackie needed to get back to the computer lab so she could work on a project with (shoot can't remember her name, bad Jason).  The lady I can't remember her name is actually a lesbian.  I found out yesterday when I saw her getting out of her car.  I went down to the library and found Jerryn.  We couldn't find a place to sit so we went to the computer lab.  Mr. Shirtlifter didn't lift his shirt once during class today, but he made up for it in the computer lab.  He didn't have time during class because he was learning how to format a hard drive and install Windows 98.  I registered for my other two Fall classes on-line and we are going to have a same class in the Fall, again at 8 AM. :)  He went to class at 11 and I continued working on my essay.  A few minutes after Jerryn left, the other classmate I have a crush on, Shane, came in and sat next to me and worked on his essay as well.  We talked a bit between sentences until it got close to class time.   The rest of the day went well.  Between English and Web Design, I called Dale and asked him to pick up some boxes for me at the Liquor store so I could start packing my stuff.  He said, "Sure, no problem."    During Web Design my theory from yesterday was reinforced: copy those that already did it, is how to do JavaScript according to Richard.  We worked on menus and he pulled them from other sites.  Ugh!  When I got home I was hoping to see the boxes I asked Dale to get for me hours earlier, but oh no.  I got home and the mail hadn't been picked up and still an hour later he's asleep.  Ah well...I'll do what I can tonight.  Had I known he wasn't going to do it, I would have stopped there on the way home from classes.  So this brings me current on my Blog.  If anything interesting develops tonight, I'll made a new post, if not, I'm working on homework and packing all night (one or the other or both, not sure yet).  Peace and Love!  Jason
