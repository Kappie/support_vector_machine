Oh, and I figured out that in fact I was awake 30 hours at the weekend, and I got 15 hours sleep on sunday night. I don't think I'll do that again for a while, the tiredness isn't too fun.  Played in a concert last night, it went well I thought. Only 1 more week of school left after these last 2 days, cos I'm not here for the last 1/2 a week, gunna be in Barcelona, w0op.  Today Mrs. Mott gave us a party. It was shit. She sat there eating and making David Brent style jokes while we sat around talking to each other *shudders* I swear if she were only a bit more fat her eyes would disappear into her face. >.  Ok, nothing else to report really, so I'm gunna play some computer/video games now, and get a cup of tea.
