I can't wait until after finals.  I can't wait until the 4 days we have off.  I can't wait.  That sums it up for me.  Friday was our last game.  We ended up winning by 2.  Adam had the game winning shot.  It was great.  I'm glad I did ok though.  I started off really bad.  I got took out a few times then the same thing happened in the second half but I did good.  I don't know how to better explain that but I had only 2 fouls and coach Green acted like I had 4 or something.  He took me out when we were on defense and put Shultz in.  I'm a bit bigger than Shultz and that doesn't seem to make sense.  Not to say that he can't play D it's just that I'm sure I could have done better if he would have left me in.  That sucked, but at least we won and I had a season high of 12 points.  w00t.  That's about it folks.  I wish I would have been more productive with my weekend but I must say I'm not worrying and I'm being happy.  Peace out homies.
