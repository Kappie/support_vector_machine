I've had this feeling the past few days that I'm forgetting / missing / or not doing something. It's this weird thing that's been hanging over my head. That combined with other confusions in my life is leaving me feeling out of phase with reality.  I've bitched about this before, but here in Binghamton... I just don't feel like the same person that I do back in California. Maybe that's why I feel like there's a lack in my life?  I feel an empty desire. I know that life in California isn't the same as what it was before I came out here.   **
