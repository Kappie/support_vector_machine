Plus he told me that he liked certain solos that I did and hated some.  It's nice to hear opinions coming from lamens so I know what the average people think of my solos.  But I really dont pay attention to their suggestions cause...well....they can't blow.  I know what sounds good and what doesn't and i have really sucked on all of my solos that i've done.  Them blues are the hardest changes to master.     Me and my dad went to listen to these two cats at Luna last night, and man could they blow.  It was the second time they have giged at Luna.  They played thier own Originals last night so we were kinda dissapointed.  We should have came to their first appearance.....thats when they blew some Blue Note Standards out of their horn.  Anyways they were still awesome, and the drummer knew how to play.  He didn't do any of that rock beat crap, and his dynamics didn't overpower the combo.(Unlike most drummers i know)----The two horns were both Tenor saxophonists from the Air Force Band of the West, but unfortunately the highest rank they can be is a seargant.  PFFFFFFFFFT!!!!!! They both sounded like Trane.  Thats always good!      After listening to those guys last night, something clicked and I just became so angry.  When it was time to solo over Straight, No Chaser(Combo Song/Fundamental Drill) i ripped that thing up.  I felt like Cannonball.  They were great.  They still weren't what i want my solos to be like, but it certainly improved.       It realy sucks to play jazz outside in the sun sweating, but as long as I can bring the sounds of Cannonball alive...its worth it!  Cario Out
