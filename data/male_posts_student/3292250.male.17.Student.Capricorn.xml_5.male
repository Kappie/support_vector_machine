And I don't mean like the tolerable conservatives (I can't name any, but they're the moderate ones), I mean super freakish "my way and everyone else must burn in Hell" conservatives. Turns out  urlLink a small group of these evil people have formed a blog to get their "opinion" across . They've only got a handful of posts, and all of them in some way hatefully bash liberals or gays. Didn't we learn in debate that insults are the best way to get your point across? No, we didn't? That's what I thought. To top it off, they don't research their point first. They think that the phrase "Under God" was written into the Pledge by the Founding Fathers. Wrong. It was added by a 1954 Congressional Act. You're entitled to you opinion and all, but when you get your facts wrong, and use phrases like " Those liberal scumbags. They should have been the fisrt to be put in the concentration camps." to conclude, I'm sorry, but I'm just not going to even give you an ounce of respect, because based on your writings, you want to get rid of me and everyone else like me. As a matter of fact, you group gays in the same category as terrorists, i.e.: "Bush stood up to those damn Iraqi terrorists that caused Septemeber 11th (along with the homosexuals, of course)". If this is the future of America, then I'm scarred out of my mind.
