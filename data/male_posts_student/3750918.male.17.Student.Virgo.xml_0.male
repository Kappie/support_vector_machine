What is the Patriot Act and what does it do, and how does it "erode our civil rights"? The Patriot Act allows the law to treat suspected terrorists in the same way suspected drug dealers and traffickers are already treated. This means that they can be wiretapped, etc. In a nutshell, the Patriot Act allows law enforcement to track down terrorists with the same aggressiveness and the same law as  the law that already exists  for drug dealers. Sorry for sounding redundant there.  Michael then asked the caller which she was more afraid of, terrorists or drug dealers? If you chose terrorists, you like the Patriot Act. A sincere "thank you" to John Ashcroft, for making this country safer.  If someone is worried about the Patriot Act taking away their rights, simply ask them, "which rights are the Patriot Act jeopardizing?" Also, ask them to cite even one case in law in which the Patriot Act was used to unjustly prosecute someone. Enjoy the stumbling and backpedaling that ensues.
