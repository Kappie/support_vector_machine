I have a geography assignment to complete and I am wasting my time idling it away on a pointless weblog that no one is ever going to look at. Regardless, I'll keep on updating.  Well as a blogger user, I've been given special priveledges at gmail! MAD! Thanks a billion blogger!  :)  Anyways... life has been good, it was strange, almost poetic in way. I remeber, yesterday I was going fishing and then... ALL OF A SUDDEN a very attractive girl about my age is walking directly parallel with me and is walking straight towards me! I catch her eye, she catches mine and then we stare at eachother, then she smiles at me. It was strange, maybe it was because of the fact that my sister was talking about fishes weeing into the sea and other stuff like that...  It sounds lame I know, but still, it brightened up my day!
