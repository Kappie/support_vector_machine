We fought online for a while, and then I went over there. Things got better and better as the day progressed. I bought a new jacket today, I quite like it. I've never really owned anything like it before. I also found out Crystal has a secret online diary. I know the URL, just not the password. I'm sure if I really tried I could find it out, maybe get Marks help with that. But I won't because I respect the fact that she set it up so that I didn't know what was going on inside her head. I also started one a while back, but never followed through with it and now I forget my username. Ha, well, that's how it goes, I suppose. Ugh. I've had enough pizza the last couple days. And I probably get more tomorrow at work. I have to stay 3 hours after close and clean, put out stock, and help move the stuff from the toystore and remote storage back to the store. How fun does that sound?  Ick. I'm hoping to see crystal monday. Holy shit, then tuesday is New Years Eve already. Crystal is trying to throw together a last minute thing at her house...I hope some ppl show up.  I injured my elbow.  urlLink  postCount('aq2002');
