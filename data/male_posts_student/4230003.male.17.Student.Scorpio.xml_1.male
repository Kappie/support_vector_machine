I got bored, decided to read Claire's blog, and I must say "Damn", she's written more in the past month on her Blog than I have the whole year for schoolwork! That's dedication. So, I felt inspired, and here you are, my... Blog. lovely name for a voyeuristic and uncensored, intimate peak into an individual's mindworks. God help you, your'e in   my   head.      So this is me,  who am I  you may ask? I have no idea. I am everyone and I am no one.      Let's see.... Me..... Ok.... I know: You name it.... I'll eat it?.... ewwch, no, disregard that last one. I have no idea how to explain myself, perhaps future posts will slowly build up a picture of who I am, hopefully. I think this is more carthartic on my behalf, but, you may also get enjoyment out of reading it. WARNING: I have strange encounters, bizarre experiences, and really quirky friends. This blog is not for the light of heart, and if you have a pace-maker, please close this browser immediately. Ok, that should do for a first try. I hope to see you next time... If anything happens. Yeah. Ciao! ...thats Italian ;)
