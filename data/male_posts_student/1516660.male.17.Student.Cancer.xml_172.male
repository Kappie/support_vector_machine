I completed an E-Maths chapter (Geometry), a SS chatper (People: Our Only Resource) and completed the Physics Unit of Electricty (Magnetism and Electromagnet). I found that hor, I am very early in my revision. Later hor, I will have nothing to revise come the days before the subject's exam! Woah!!   Okay...the main attraction of the day lies in the afternoon. I am meeting XC, Mel, HuiMin and Ben in the library to study together. I said I won't come until I studied my SS and E-Maths. I did them in the morning, so I went there lor.  I went to the library to try to find HuiMin first. Woah!! I cannot find her. Searched everywhere. Later, at 2nd floor, she spotted me. Meow meow!! We then called Melvin, who said will be coming. So, we went to the chair and started first. I was looking at the problems in my A-Maths TYS when Melvin messaged, asking us to go down to BK to eat. We go down lor.  At BK, we chatted a bit. We are trying to spot XC. After a while, he came and we all came running outside telling him to go BK. Meow meow!! Today's Chem Prac was easy. His titration was very accurate and he got full marks for QA. Ayiah! Overall full marks lor! Meow meow!! After that, we ate lor. I brought a drink (using XC's money).  After that, we chatted, then started doing revision. Ben then joined us. We then studied and studied. I studied the Physic chatpers lor. All thanks to Wendy's Longman book. I finally understood magnetism!! Before long, Ben wanted to move up to the cinema. There are tables there.   We moved up there lor. Thern, we brought popcorn so we won't get chased out. I owed XC money again. I completed the Physics chapters!! Then, HuiMin said she wanted to watch The Park, a scary movie. I was very reluctant, because today got tutition ma. I called home to lie about doing homework and returning at 7. XC said I lie without batting my eyelids. Meow!! Then, Father called. He said to cancel if I am to come home that late. So I cancelled my tutition lor. Besides, I feel confident already. Alright. Once that is done, we go buy tiks. They also gave us 3D glasses. Oh. A 3D movie.  Woah!! I was quite nervous you know! My first time watching horror movies. Meow meow!! First scene already so scary le. I felt like going out and don't watch le. My heart kept thumping away. Adrenaline keep rushing through my body (ahh! Niow I know what to write for the effects of adrenaline....if that qns ever does come out!). Woah lao!! Every scary scene is so darn scary. I could have a heart attack any minute you know! My fingers were constantly in my ear, and it went deeper as scary scenes come out. Meow meow!! The scenes are still stuck in my memory!! Ayiah!! How!!!! But the ending is nice. It's touching!  Came back at 7.15, bathed, ate and came online. Better end this. WQ!! I finished writing le ha!! Gimme the address now!! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
