Oh well--the lovin is good. Its been so long since I've been with someone who I could truly respect and admire. I don't feel like I even deserve her. Nothing is certain, but I think that's part of what makes everything great. And I think she truly admires me too. We have different lives and different paths to take, but I think our connection may last forever in one form or another. I sometimes wish I had more to hold onto, but I think she is teaching me that that is not what it is about. She is a wise young lady. I wish they all could be California girls...  ROFL!!!!
