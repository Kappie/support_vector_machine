He went to California to see his dad and then he is going to Hawaii. Then school starts for him. He is out of my life for at least a year now. I have to go to St. Cloud next Wednesday to finish my Shift Supervisortraining. It is just like a school class for like 8 hours. I have really been working lately. This coming check should have about 80 hours on it.   2) Summer is almost 2/3 over. Where thefrick has it gone? I have spent like $150 or so just on some really nice fishing stuff. I got 2 ultralite rods, and 1 reel. 2 walleye/ bass rods with a reel, and about $35 of plastics and crankbaits from one of my neighbors all for $55. Then I have gone to Fleet Farm and Reeds to buy more tackle and a new box. But so far I have been fishing 3 times.  3) My grandma has given me a .22 and a bunch of other stuff that used to be my grandpa's. My mom is scared to death that someone (my brother) will get shot. But thats not much of a loss.  I really haven't done much exept play tennis, and I must say that each time I play houle, our score is very close- well not the set or game score, but each game we are very close. I will beat him this summer.
