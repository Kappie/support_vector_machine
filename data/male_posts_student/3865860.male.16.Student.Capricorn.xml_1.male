Oh yeah i laughed at woosey's sister and cousin playin WWE. Seeing someone being dragged along on a motor bike and thrown into an electric fence while they are jus wearing a bikini never loses its appeal :) Anyways its Friday tomorrow, Fridays always make me happy because they are the start of the weekend yay!!!!!! Going to Birmingham on Sat morning with Matt if you wanna come just come I don't mind :) Everyone seems to think i have a frog fetish :/i'd like to put thinks straight, i don't have a frog fetish i just like frogs :)  Any way im bored and tired and scared and fucked up as usual :) so see yous!
