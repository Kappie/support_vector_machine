I Really Liked 'They Call Me Tater Salad' It Was Halirous And I Would Recommend It For Mature Audiences To See, But None Of The 'Young Ones. As Far As 'The Big Bounce'... They Could Have Made The Movie Last 10 Minutes Long, But They Stretched It Out Into A Good 1Hr  A Half. The Movie 'The Big Bouce' Is Basically A Movie Where Everyone Screws Everyone Ever....Stupid!
