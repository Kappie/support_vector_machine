I came back at 9 AM, took a shower, and then a nap. At 1 PM, I went to my friend's brother's birthday party. It was at some stupid kids place. Laser tag was fun though, I got almost 10,000 points. Afterwards, I went to my friends house, another dude came over and we were just chillin.   Then later on we went to see Chronicles of Riddick. It was alright. Not bad, nothing special though. Unless you like Vin Diesal or Sci fi movies, I wouldn't really recommend it.   By the time I got home it was like 11:30 PM. I was pretty tired so I just went to sleep. Anyway that was my day, I might post again later today...maybe.
