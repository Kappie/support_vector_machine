I just bought the CD of Evanescence. I think I should be more different then other people. Yesterday I saw this programme on the tube about bicuriousity. Why not? Maybe it's really cool to be bi, it's definitly different. I think I'm going to set 'being different' as my goal for this year.   At the moment I'm chatting to this girl. I hate the people I know. They 1) do not pay enough attention to me or 2) are not nice or 3) are so smallminded. Maybe I shouldn't complain that much. There are some nice people I know. And guess what, my (ex-)best friend is finally showing interest in me. Where has that been the past 2 weeks when I needed him? No he thought that being with his new girlfriend was more important then helping a friend who was thinking of killing himself. Yeah I have a problem and no I'm not going to see a doctor and I'm not mad. But it's over now (but for how long?).  I'm realling looking forward to when I'm able to go away from here for a year, this country and this continent. Not that things will be different somewhere else. But when I'm in a new enviroment I get the chance to make a fresh start. Life is like a science-test at school. I never get the first question right until I made the second one that is exactly like the first question but with different numbers.
