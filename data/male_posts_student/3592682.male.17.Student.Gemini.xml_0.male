'wad great timing'.. i tot to myself.. but it seems to be happening for the past few days.. however, today's a little different.. i didnt feel a bit tired.. i felt full of life and energetic.. but lazy bones are like the spots on a leapord's skin..  dragging my legs to the toilet.. hmmm.. i felt really great today.. besides the time that i had to ask ppl to shut up.. i hate throwing my tantrum.. well.. it's truly hard to control.. but yah, its our choice.. there'll be times when i feel really guilty doing something becos someone did something to mi which i didnt like so i double the pain back which shldnt be the case cos always treat others how u wld like to be treated and place urself in someone elses' shoes.. well.. thats the way to be considerate.. i dun like to strain any friendships cos i feel that everyone of our frens are basically "god's gift".. why i had to put those inverted commas?.. cos i dun believe in god?.. yah.. and so.. now here i amat home.. writing a bloggy.. hoping i'll suddenly get motivated to study and wishing for a freaking miracle to pass mi by that there will be no oral this sat cos it seems like my nervous system will soon break down and get mi the stomach aches.. yah..  hahahx.. well.. come quickly.. go quickly ba.. last year here anywayzx.. i mean.. hopefully.. so.. mus really whack my way thru.. otherwise.. i confirm i sure regret which infact i already am cos i'm basically wasting my precious time here typing a blog for the fun of it?.. or maybe for pleasure?.. lolzx.. wad ever it is.. today's been really great.. always wishing tomolo's beta.. -peace out-
