RHINO!! haha... sorry. but anyways.  it felt as if we were at more of a boot camp then a governmental camp of sorts. our counselors consisted of a fruit, a hardass, and another fruit. but we did impeach and try our mayor for fraternization with the ladies (that's illegal). oh and he resisted arrest as well. but eventually we got him tried. guilty. haha... but we had so many assemblies throughout the week in an auditorium that had about 6 inches of leg room, combined with no arm room, monotonous speakers, and being awake since 5 that morning. all of this together led to a full BS nap time during the assemblies.   our volleyball team sucked it up though. we did win the toilet bowl. RHINO!! PETER!! hahaha... inside joke that absolutely no one that reads this will get. we did hold many a game of ultimate frisbee though. we tried tackle style but... ouch. i also sprained my knee doing monkey rolls during cal. great fun.   as for other entertainment subjects, i played chess many times. i ended up with a 9-2 record. not bad but could be better. plus we played hackysack plenty of times. that was fun.   some people decided to thouroughly piss off the minnesota sec of state though. somebody asked her what her opinion on gay marriage is and she responded " marriage is a bond between a man and a woman. done." many people then went up to the mic's and proceeded to tell her about their own opinions on gay marriage. now these mic's were set up for questions, not debates. let me tell you this, the sec of state was not a happy camper when about 15 people kept telling her that it was a person's choice to who they marry and trying to change her opinion. not good. counselors were pissed.   on another note, our city won the war with minneapolis. after they decided to dump water on our counselors outside, we agreed on a cadence run at 5 in the morning the next day. we went to sleep early, then at 5, we were outside. as we ran past their dorms, with open windows, we yelled out " HEY YOU!! MINNEAPOLIS!! WAKE UP!! MINNEAPOLIS!!" and let me tell you, we saw many birds that morning.  we were told at the beginning of the week that we would most likely leave BS with a new view on things. oddly enough, it's true. but i don't know how. i just feel like i am a new person, as if i am reborn. eh. i'm not going to waste many brain cells on that issue.  oh by the way Penelope, bill and i did recieve your guys' letter. we were going to write back but it would've been pointless because there weren't going to be any more speakers traveling between BS and GS. so i decided i would just talk to you later. and tell Acceb that we can take the death threats.   well anyways, i am going to go write in my real journal. more info in there. and now i have 70 bucks. yay... hehehe... TYRONE... the plan is going as planned? shoi.  poopscotch.
