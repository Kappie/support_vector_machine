Goddamn it.  We have a war going on that is going to cost in excess of 100 Billion dollars, and they dump out a tax-break for the rich.  Sweet.  Did you read that?  RECORD DEFICITS .  This is what we get when a man who couldn't even figure out how to say "nuclear" the right way is running the show.  This is what we get when CEO's and Board Directors get cabinet and staff positions.  A tax cut for the wealthiest 1% and debt for you and I.  Not to mention the fact that this money is all going towards the military and contracting out post-Iraq work to their best buddies.  If they were the "Christians" they claim to be, they'd be running us into the red to make sure that we have the finest educational and health systems in the world(especially with SARS running rampant), instead, they reveal their true nature by gutting our financial future and giving it to the people who need it the least, their fat rich white friends.  If you think that the majority of their boost in military spending is going to our precious troops, wake the fuck up.  It is going to the people over at Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.  We have to replace the ordinance we used up in our orgy of "shock and awe" bombing.  All you Republicans can suck my ass.  You've sucked my blood long enough.  Fuck you George W., and fuck you Congress.  Let's see if anyone in the Senate remembers who they're supposed to work for.  Last chance to prove me wrong, whores.  November 2004 can't come soon enough.   Special P.S.to George W. Bush- Ok, Baghdad has fallen.  Whoopee.  You finaly fixed the dubious at best problem your daddy's boss made.  Where the fuck is Osama Bin Laden, and why the fuck isn't his head on a pole at the top of the Empire State Building?
