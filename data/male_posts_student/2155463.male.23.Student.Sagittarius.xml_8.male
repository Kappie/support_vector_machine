At the gocery store, it's being able to find Catawba wine...I had some the last time I went up to Lake Erie and I thought it was great, but I couldn't find it around here.  Lo and behold, the Acme up the street has it...  So then I went to Wal-Mart (forgetting what day of the year it was until I walked in the door, at which point it's too late) because I had to find some presents for the Mortar Board thing on Monday.  For some reason, I just absolutely love Legos (both the real and generic kinds...they're basically all the same)...just sitting there seeing a whole aisle of them, I just wanted to buy a bunch of them and put them together.  I think they should be euphemistically labeled the "clumsy kids' models," because that's really what they are - if you can't do models (either because you ARE clumsy like me, or because you don't have the patience for it (like me), or you don't like making a mess (like me)), then you do Legos.  But maybe it's because you can't "blow up" a model and then put it back together...
