I feel that occasionally a break from strenuous study adds to your understanding of whatever your studying. I found this to be true when I was reading Thoreau (WOW that was a long time ago) and I practice this regularly. I don't know if that is a good or a bad habit. I wanted to test out the waters of blogging and I have, so Good Night!   ~ Frank
