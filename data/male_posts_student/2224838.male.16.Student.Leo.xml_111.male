Lomo cameras are manufactured by a small company in Russia, and only in Russia, but they have become somewhat of an underground sensation for photographers. I have been wanting to try one of these out for a while, and now I have a chance to experiment with one for myself. Nate even wants to get in on the lomo-action, so we are going to get some pointers from  urlLink The lomographic Society International  before doing some experimentation of our own.
