One side does not allow us to believe everything off hand; the other does not let us necessarily dismiss anything off hand.   Ideally, before a scientist can contribute to the world of knowledge, he must first learn all that has been compiled before him; what others have observed and cross referenced, many times back thousands of years. "I stand on the shoulder of giants," said Newton.   This is the world of a priori, which means the system of cross-referencing by accumulated knowledge. When you approach a zoologist with a report of a creature that has feathers, a bill, waddles on webbed feet and goes "quack, quack" there is an a priori reason for that zoologist to say "It's a duck." He doesn't have to go and observe it himself and waste time because there is an appropriate cross reference for such a phenomenon. It's a duck!  When you approach a zoologist and say "I saw something with scales, that was pink, has 5 legs and a bill like a bird but a tail like a fish." You are not going to get a good reply because there is an a priori reason for him to say there is not such creature. There is no catalogue for such an animal as you described. "Now, go see your doctor or get off the gin."   Nothing happens contraryto the laws of nature, except the impossible...  that never happens.   ThePresident of Cameroon hired a barberto shave everybody who doesn't shave himself  only them. The question is... who shaved the barber?   The unexplained points us to where we must look, not from where we must flee.   Understanding, as opposed to proper application, represents a function of science, not of engineering.
