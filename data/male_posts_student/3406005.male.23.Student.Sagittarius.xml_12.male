And Conservative Alberta was already showing signs of a backlash last night.  "I haven't understood Ontario in the past and I don't understand it now," said Ted Morton, an adviser to Mr. Harper and champion of democratic reform.   Good thing. After the 2000 election, Stephen Harper himself gave up on reforming Canada at the federal level. Now, the priority of Albertan Conservatives should be to get Morton elected, into the Alberta cabinet and, eventually, into the premier's office.
