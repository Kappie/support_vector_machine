Alright, if you want to merge blogs or move all your posts to another blog that you created, you're going to have to copy and paste every single one.  I'm going to teach you the quick and easy way, and it's very simple.    1. Open up two browser windows or tabs or whatever. 2. Send one of them to the edit posts section of your old blog. 3. Let that load. 4. Use the other one to create a new post for the new blog.  Make sure that your new blog is already created at this point. 5. When your old blog's posts have all shown up on the Edit posts page, go down to the very first one (you may need to select View 50 entries at once to see them all, if not 100, depending on the size of your blog).  Click Edit.   6. Copy all of the text, and then, at the bottom, where it says More Post Options, open it up, to see what the date and time of the post is. 7. Now, in the new blog's Create New Post page, put in the title of your post, paste the contents, and then, under More Post Options, enter the same date and time that you saw that the post was originally posted at. 8. Click Publish Post, then return to your Old Blog's browser window. 9. Hit the back button.  All of your posts will already be loaded, and you can keep editing each post, and repeating from Step 6 until you are all done.  It may take you a little while, but, it's the easiest way to move posts between blogs.     Up Next on Digital Lust : Today's Video of the Day, Strong Bad Email!
