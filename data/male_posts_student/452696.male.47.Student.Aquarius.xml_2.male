I mean let's face it, I can link to the space provided by my ISP if I want to display graphics or video. And since I'm already spending over 40.00 a month for th epriveledge of using the Internet, I may as well do my blogging for zip. I like Blogger better anyways. I didn't see any real advantage to using theirs over Blogger. Maybe I'm blind to it, but even Blogger Pro (for me) serves no real advantage. Maybe I need to become more verbose.
