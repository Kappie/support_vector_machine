I've dropped out of the blog scene for a while so I'm just checkin' in to let everyone know that I didn't fall off the face of the earth. I promise that I will post more frequently when I get back to school.  Lately I've been watching Cartoon Network (gasp!)- well, only for two great shows:  The Family Guy  and  Futurama . I regret missing out on these shows when they first came out, especially before Futurama was canned by Fox. I'll try to catch up on all the missed episodes by watching the reruns on Adult Swim.  The snow is piling up outside as I speak. After consulting with the weather.com radar (I guess I'm a nerd), here are my predictions: 4 inches of snow by morning, 2 hour delay for the NRHS crew, and 10 homeless people die from the wind chill. If you wake up and see only 2 inches of snow tomorrow morning, don't kill me -- I'm not getting paid to make these forecasts yet. : )  Before I go, I'd like to congratulate Darin, Doug, and BK on their successful season!  Until next time,  -BIGsmut.
