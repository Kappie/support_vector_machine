Went to sgh to visit my dad just now. his operation was smooth. but he cant walk for the next few days cause he's under drip. it was quite weird for me cos i seldom show affections for my family one but i actually sms him at about 1200hr during class to tell him not to worry. haha. really hope my dad can get well soon. yup.  Just now i sent my mum home, on the way i asked her to top up all my ezi link and phone for me. within like 10min, i spent 15 bucks lor. i felt nothing initially. but when we were on the mrt, i saw her counting how much she spent a day. checking her receipts and stuff. i realised she actually scrimped and saved alot. yet i only know how to waste money. i felt very guilty and sad. i dont want to waste my parents' money, cos i know earning is very tough. i will try from today onwards to save more. yup. i think i'm going to lose a friend. she is a very nice girl. clever and all sorts. but seems like she wun be calling me liao. haix.
