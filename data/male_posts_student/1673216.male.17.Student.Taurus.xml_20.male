I have asked if my mom signed the papers to take the IB tests. And she said no, and she doesn't care. I asked if I should just not take the test, and she doesn't care. I asked if I should just drop IB, and she doesn't care. I asked if I should just drop school, and she doesn't care. I asked if I should just leave and not come back, and she doesn't care. That's what's going to happen anyway, she says. What? Yes. You are done using my stuff, so you might as while go live the responsibility free life you like. Oh.. I was under the presumption that I had a family that loved me. You are. But you just said... Ok whatever.
