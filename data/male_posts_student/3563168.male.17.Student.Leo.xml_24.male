This isn't the Japanese Seizure Robots link that I tricked you guys with, so you can enjoy what I write here. I don't care if you read this or not, because it helps me pass the time.       Anyway, I can't get this little "About Me" section to work right, so if you know how to work it, then let me know. And if you know how to work it and you don't want to let me know, then go to hell.   Well, that's kinda harsh, so go to hell for about 5 minutes.       Also, send this to anyone you know that knows me, because I'm gonna make this thing badass, I just haven't had the time that much right now.
