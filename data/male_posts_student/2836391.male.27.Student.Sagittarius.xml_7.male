She's recently left a violent relationship, and she's having some quite serious health problems. Recently, she had a fight with her mother, and moved out of home.  She was texting me on Friday night, at first just saying she was having a hard time, but not wanting to say why, and then gradually opening up, and letting me know what was going on. I did the best I could to reassure her, to tell her that life would get better. She felt like no one would notice if she made a clean break, just disappeared and started again somewhere else.  I don't always know what to say to people in these times. I want to be able to tell them that it will all work out for them, that life will settle down again. I want to tell them that God has His plan for their life, and He knows what is best. The trouble is, sometimes I have trouble believing this about my own life and circumstances, let alone about anyone else's. As much as I want to accept that God is in control of things, and that everything that happens is to His purpose, when things hurt, when I feel myself at the bottom, taking another kick in the teeth, I find it hard to reconcile the image of a loving father with the situation I find myself in.  I guess I'm not the only one who finds myself wondering. Its not that I doubt God's love for me, its just that when the pain comes, I wonder why He lets it happen, how this can be for my benefit.  What do you think? I'd love to hear your views.
