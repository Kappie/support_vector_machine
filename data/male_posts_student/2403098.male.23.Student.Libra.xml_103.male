I should throw in some other keywords people will probably search for related to demorol, just to get more google hits. Canada, Free, XXX, no prescription, opiate, Rx, yadda yadda. Some poor sap is gonna be desperate for Demorol and end up here. Sorry, got nothing for you.    I do have some demorol though, but you can't have it. I just took one, I'm hoping it makes me go to sleep. It was prescribed to me after my FIVE hour dentist appointment two days ago. Thankfully, I barely remember any of it. I haven't mentioned this dental extravaganzaon the ole' blogger, because A) no one cares and B) I just haven't... but I'm having lots of dental work done this summer, so there, it's mentioned. My ever-troublesome teeth are being completely fixed up for good this summer, and all in several very long appointments. 5 apointments to be exact.Ever seen an episode of extreme make-over? Well the parts where they do the cosmetic dentistry.. that's my summer vacation (insert "woo"). Some go to Paris, some go to the lake, I go to the dentist.    I hate the dentist, well actually I LOVE my new dentist, but I hate the idea of "going" to the dentist. I always have hated it, hence I have neglected the health and stability of my mouth by avoiding dental exams at all costs. Though they are aesthetically fine, and seemingly normal in appearance, my teethpossess many small problems that will all be corrected over the course of the next few months. Hell, over the past few yearsmy teeth havepractically been breaking out of my mouth, sometimes with the help of drunkenasses knocking them out.. (I should send you the bill). Am I excited about all the dental appointments? Not really. Do like the fact that they knock me out each time I go in there and when I wake up I have new and exciting things in my mouth? Yeah. I am trying to look at the bright side. Maybe I'll throw up some "before and after" shit after it's all finished. They've only taken about 25 pictures of my mouth so far. And one of me with my pants down when they thought I was knocked out in the dental chair.. but I CAUGHT them. Silly bastards.    jk.    I haven't been too talkative lately and especially not too write-a-tive, as you can tell from my lack of postings. I have had kind of a lot on my plate and it constantly seems like one thing after another when you're stressed. Sometimes when life gets so busy, I don't have the energy to be there for everyone else, and I just need some time for me. I hate that, because I like to be the ear for friends, and the fun times for people I enjoy being around, but sometimes you just have to step back and handle your own shit. The GOOD news, however, is that things are looking so up. In fact things are turning into perfection. I have been in a really downer type mood for the past few months due to some annoying circumstances on the homefront, possible graduationhindrances, etc..but everything is coming up roses now. I appreciate all the support of people who care about me during the stresses of life (all of them, not just these). I kept saying that the rest of my life, especially the rest of this calendar year, better be fantastic because it's been a hell of a year so far. Thankfully, it appears that life will exceed my greatest expectations in the coming months and years. I plan on it.    I got a speeding ticket today. That was funny. Officer Scott was so nice though. He was all: "Have you had a ticket lately?" and I thought for a moment, remembering that crazy night when I got an open container violation for transporting both lauren and an open bottle of wine back to her apartment. Thankfully that doesn't show on my record, as the officer that evening (name uknown) was equallygenerous. "No  don't think so, sir." I replied. My fourth "excessive speed" violation in the past 3 years was handed to me and I was free to go.It may sound like abad offense, but basically it just means that I was "going over the speed limit," I get slapped on the hand, pay a 50 - 75 dollar fine, and go about my way with a clean record. I don't really have75 smackers laying around, but shit, I'll find it justto not have to take some defensive driving course. I said a little thank-you prayer as I continued on my way to the gym (at a reduced speed of 40 mph instead of the 58 mph I was clocked at).    Geeze, what a bust it would have been to get a "real" ticket just for going to the gym. It would have probably made me stop working out forever. "didn't you used to go to the gym, like, ALL the time Mason?" "yeah, but then I got a speeding ticket.. and I just said.. fuck it, this is not worth that kind of shit"
