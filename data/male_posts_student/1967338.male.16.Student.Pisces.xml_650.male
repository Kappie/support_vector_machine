In other news, I have considerably less hair than usual, and have recieved much congratulation on shaving quite a bit of my hair for a single scene. It doesn't look that bad, actually, and is pleasently soft and fuzzy, though a bit cold. Despite its advantages, it will be grown to its original length. I could get used to it being incredibly short, but two days before cutting it i had it in cornrows and it looked awesome! The day after that, only half was shaved. Nathan's idea, we had a few different explainations to toss out at anyone who asked, my favourite being that we were running late and could only shave half. We will have pictures, for anyone interested.  Explanation on the new template: Nathan and I had an arguement about one of the prostitute costumes. I said she looked like a ninja prostitute and he insisted she was a pirate. The arguement was long and rather pointless.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
