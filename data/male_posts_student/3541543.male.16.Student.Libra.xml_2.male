WTF kind of fortune is that haha. if anyone else has any "real" funky, messed up fortunes i wanna see if you can beat that one lol.  4)i hope brittany starts to thoroughly enjoy her free time from school. and i doubt you will be stuck at the Y till your 18. sucks i couldnt work in the nursery with you, damn people at the Y. what happened to equal oppurtunity employment.  5)i think pokemon is/was pretty fun. i often find myself singing the theme song to the cartoon all the time. and i sing it to piss off my brothers when we stuck in the car by ourselves. and i CANNOT sing lol so its a great time.  6)i think i going to bahamas for spring break but not totally certain seeing its months away. hoping ash is able to come with, i think it would be an awesome experience. after bahamas next destination will be greece, homeland to 1/4th of myself. and it is suppose to be pretty wicked cool there, ancient ruins and all.  7)secret window with jonny depp looks pretty good and i wanna see it sometime. too bad my brother saw it already and fugging told me the end, argh he pisses me off.  8)saw incubus on tv and i think they tried too hard to be cool. they are dorks but i love them still, the best band ever.  9)listening to flake and song makes me think of ash, i mean the title and everything fit so well. jack johnson is freaking crazy awesome and this song and tons of other songs are just killer.   10)going to the beach tomorrow and stomach hair is in bad shape, i am a fool for shaving a damn fool. i cant wait till winter comes haha then ill let it grow back. going to the beach i really wish i had my friends their to enjoy it with me. the beach just doesnt seem all its cracked up to be without people to share it with. next time im going i hoping i can get a couple of buds to come and just tear it up on the body board haha.   mk well thats all i can show you about my thoughts, gotta keep it nice and clean. and oh yeah britt if you start checking the blog out please do not scroll down and read the early stuff. its a load of retarded crap and i regret having writing down what i did lol. alright see ya later
