Not that we wouldn't want to eventually go back, but that if it could be prolonged, I'm sure we all would gladly push it back. This school year isn't going to be bad or anything. It is just going to be very stressful, but at the same time  so much fun!  Parts of me will miss this past year. Being a junior was the most fun I've had... ever. So then, I guess we can assume that senior year will be all the better. Between Concert Choir, Show Choir, San Francisco, and Drama, not to mention all the numerous random fun activities there will be throughout the year, I don't think I have to worry about not having enough fun with all of you crazy fun people. So until the next post.   {Geoffrey}
