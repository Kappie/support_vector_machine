It's in me, on my mind, etched into my depths. If you're not part of te solution, you're part of the problem.  Henceforth, I will attempt to be part of the solution. Now the question is, which applies to all other resolutions in life, will I be able to sustain my attempt.  Pulled out of school today to go to the "JC open-houses". Intended to go jamming. Plans changed. Instead, I was out playing pool. Out with smart maats and minahs. Smart maats and minahs who teach me things about other maats and minahs. Today I learned that there are many different kinds of maats and minahs. They're like freaking species within a species within a species within a species. Amazing.
