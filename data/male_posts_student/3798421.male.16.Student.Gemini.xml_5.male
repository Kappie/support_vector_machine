But, this morning I want to write a story. A long one. I have no clue yet what it is about. May God let it flow through me. Obviously, the way to get a story done is write about something you know well. Andrea and I are going to write a story at mack2007.blogspot.com in case you are interested. Of course you are. But, on top of that, I want to write another story. How am I going to do that? I have no clue. But, write about something you know, and so I guess that leaves me with limited options. Of course, I could write about cars. I know a lot about them. Limited potential...but that is what you get. Hmm...what else could I write about? I could write about school. I definitly could do that considering I live there. That actually wouldn't be all that hard. But would it be interesting? Probably not. I really love short stories that make people think "Huh.". You know, a really good moral. Or if not a moral, at least something crazy. Something that...well, yes, a moral. Ok, I have established that. Now that I have that down, what should I stinking write about? Is this Jared with writer's block? How did that happen? You know, Jared, for someone without anything to say you sure do talk a lot. At least I am a fast typer. This would be pure torture if I wrote really slow. My dad writes slow. He has made whoever came up with the "peck the keyboard slowly one finger at a time" method very proud. Not to mention sometimes his grammar is not all that great sometimes. But, God love him, he has brains. I know he has got to be a genius. Sometimes he wastes that. Other times he puts that to great use. I just hope that I get half of the ingenuity that has been bestowed upon him. I have really got to stop wasting my life. Things like staying up until noon can really screw me up. Tomorrow I could do a million things, but most likely I will do nothing much. I AM having a small party. That will be great fun. And I have to mow. And send a bill out for mowing the neighbors lawn. Also, I have to set up the volley ball net. And it would be great to work on my car some. Another thing that would be amazing is if I could actually get my car done in the future. I guess it all comes down to working on it like a madman. I can write like a madman, how come I can't make a car like a madman? You know, I have no clue what my words per minute are, but I have been typing this only for about ten minutes so far. I wonder if I could write a book that fast? If I could do that, do you know how quick it would go? It would be on the shelves yesterday! But, unfortunatly, there are things to think about in books like a plot. That sucks, because you have to think about it. See, here I am typing without really thinking. I am just seeing how fast I can type in a short amount of time late at night. Late at night is the thing, see? It is harder to make sense at night. Of course, I can't claim I am making sense here. I am rambling. I should really come up with someting cool to do with this blog. I know Andrea and I are already doing something cool with Mack's. That is going to turn out awesome. I can't wait to get to this one scene (that I personally protested, let that be on the record). Anyway, I can't wait because that should really be very interesting. Interesting is quite the understatement here. Actually, I wonder about that. I wonder if, because, seriously those two characters are the equivelant of ourselves. In all honesty, they are. So, if the story goes a certain direction, are we hoping OUR relationship will go in that direction? I really hope not. I think this because Andrea and I have already had a chance at a relationship, and it did not work out. I really doubt it would work out again. First off, I don't think I treat people the way I should. I get that from my dad, too. I guess it is a really undesireable trait in the Porcenaluk clan. Will I be able to change? I want to be kind and a good person, I really do. I also know that I have trouble with that. Speaking of things I know about myself, I know that I am not the best looking person on the planet, and I try to make up for that in personality. But, I am like TNT. Useful for short stints? Ok, bad metephor. What I am trying to say, is from the "data" I have "gathered" from girls who like or have liked me, I am attractive at first, at least, because I can be outgoing, and quick witted. That is when I am trying to further a relationship. I have trouble, though, when I have to be in a relationship for a long time, because I am not trying to get that girl so bad. Then I can turn into a real bad person. I know I do. And I hate that. You would think it would be easy just...changing. But it is as bad as trying to quit smoking (not that I would know). It is like trying to breathe underwater without air. Let's just say that changing the way I act is difficult. Is it my chemical composition that makes me like a tiger on a hunt at first and then a...I don't know...lion not on the hunt (for lack of better words) as time goes on? I hear that, at least in some sort of animal, they are doing these tests that prove that being someone who doesn't cheat on their girlfriend or wife is hereditary. There is this gene that controls that or something. I just worry about that. I don't want to cheat on anybody. So, there is another reason I should just stay away from girls. Not to mention, I think that Andrea is starting to like me again. I know she is reading this at this moment in time, and I wish I knew what she was thinking. All I can say is maybe I am dead wrong. Maybe she still hates my guts. But I highly doubt that. I am just hoping that I am wrong. Andrea, don't go that route. Me and her, we make great friends. I enjoy her company. I like talking to her a lot because sometimes I have no one else to talk to about my problems and feelings. But, I really can't/don't-want-to get into a romantic relationship with her. To be honest...I do find her attractive. But I also still find Andi attractive...I find lots of girls attractive, that does not mean that I want to go out with them. Boy is this hard to explain, and even harder to say. Especially because I know she is reading this. That is the toughest part. But, if I had advice for her, and I do, stick with Brian. He is good for her. I never want to come between the two of them. If this means suspending the story for a little while, that would be ok...I would rather not, but if it comes to that. I just feel so sick, I hate being the wedge in a relationship. Of course, if I am totally wrong, and am baring all of my feelings for nothing, well, it goes to show you how open and stupid I can be. In fact, Andrea is probably thinking right now "What a dumbass". Ah well, that is a chance I will have to take. Maybe I will just be able to blame it on a lack of sleep as it is 12:38 and I got woken up at four thirty last night...Maybe I can blame my rantings on that. Boy do I hate uponing up and showing my feelings. And it is even worse on this blog thing. Anyone could see it. It is also bad because I can't read reations. Ah well, I am confident that I am right...I am taking a wild stab in the dark here, but I believe her relationship with her boyfriend is not going too badly nor too good, and it is becoming monotenous. It probably is going towards that line of going badly, though. She wants some spice in her life, so she still likes me. Maybe something will become of it, maybe not, she thinks. It is sure fun flirting, though, she thinks. Well, maybe I am as good as a guesser as I think I am. Maybe not. I will how close I am by if I am alive after she reads this. If she does kill me, I want these words on my gravestone:  If your not living, Your dieing.  See, I just want to say by writing all of my thoughts and feelings, and exposing them out in the open, I am living. Therefore I am not dieing. It is simple for me. Go big or go home. I just want to experience life. I can't do that being all meek all the time, can I? Oh well, I probably just provided so many loose ends in this blog I won't be able to count them all. Sheesh. I am stupid.   Live is hard.
