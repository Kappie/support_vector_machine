To show for it, one definate "no" several polite "we aren't hiring, but we'll keep it on file for six months" and a few no replies after repeated emailings (cause they don't give numbers for me to call).  Though, last night (or was it two nights ago) two entry level jobs in Portland and Sacramento opened up and I instantly sent off the necessary goods.  Those are my two best leads.  I'm trying not to get discouraged, but I'm already failing one of my goals- not moving back home.  I've got to go back.  Either the heat or the cock-a-roaches are going to get me.  Plus not talking to anyone for days on end kind of isn't cool.  Champaign you rock
