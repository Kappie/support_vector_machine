She asked the local village schoolmaster to help her.  A place that suited her was finally found, and the woman returned to England for her luggage.  Then she remembered that she hadnt noticed a bathroom, or as she called it, the water closet.  So she wrote to the schoolmaster.  He was puzzled by the initials "W.C.,"never dreaming that she was inquiring about a bathroom.  He finally asked the parish priest, who decided that W.C. stood for Wesleyan Church.  The schoolmaster then replied:  Dear Madam,  	The W.C. is situated nine miles from the house in the center of a beautiful grove of trees.  It is capable of holding 350 people at one time and is open each Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.  A large number of folks attend during the summer, so I suggest you go early, although there is plenty of standing room.  Some people like to take their lunches and make a day of it, especially Thursday, when there is an organ accompaniment.  The acoustics are very good and everyone can hear the slightest sound.  You may be interested to know that my daughter met her husband ans was married in the W.C.  We hope you will be here in time for our upcoming bazaar.  The proceeds will go toward the purchace of plush seats, which the folks agree are a long-felt need, as the present seats have holes in them.  My wife is rather delicate, therefore she cannot attend regularly. Its been six months since the last time she went.  Naturally, it pains her very much not to be able to go more often.  I shall close now with a desire to accommodate you in every possible way.  I will be happy to save a seat for you down front or near the door, whichever you prefer.
