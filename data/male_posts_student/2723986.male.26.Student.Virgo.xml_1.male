I’ll post my score here as soon as I find out – yes, even if it ends up being a 12% or something equally abysmal.  Other than that there isn’t really much going on so far this week, just the usual school/work/sleep pattern that normally takes place.  I did receive  R: Racing Evolution  in the mail the other day, and it looks to be an enjoyable, if unspectacular entry into the racing genre.  I’ll get a review written up for Thunderbolt and Diehard Xbox as soon as I’ve put in a bit more play time (I’m about 15% through the game), which will hopefully be by this weekend.  I’m using my GameFAQs RotM gift certificates to purchase Godzilla: GMK on DVD, as well as a few books and bargain games I’ve been interested in.  I never did rent any of the new Godzilla movies while I was in Japan, so I’m glad they are being released over here, with original Japanese language tracks no less!  I’ll be sure to post a mini-review as soon as my shipment arrives.  Well that about wraps this blog entry.  Till next time, Peace!
