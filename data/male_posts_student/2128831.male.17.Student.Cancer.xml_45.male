We were watching the local news and a story about the gay marriages San Francisco is performing came on. We all watched it in silence, until a woman I have class with with said: "Last night we were watching the 11 o'clock news and they were talking about this when they showed couples, uh, kissing. Now, I know it was 11 at night and this is the news, but they don't need to be showing that. OK, I'm not saying you have to get turned on by the sight of same-sex kissing females (unless the members of the same sex happen to be Kate Beckingsale and Charlize Theron, in which case you are fucking REQUIRED to get turned on), but comments like this make me angry.  I mean I am gay!  How does she know I'm not? In fact, to make a point, as soon as she uttered that ridiculous sentence, I turned to the balding man sitting to my right and open-mouthed kissed him during the entire commercial break. (We have a date this Friday. Not really)  Does the fact that I did not actually do that make my argument less valid? Do I even have an argument? The answer is no. She just pissed me off a bit, and in the interest of keeping my cool, I chose the online route for venting, much to your chagrin? But now I found out the real reason...  I'm tired is because I'm overworked. Here's why: a. The population of this country is 273 million. b. 140 million are retired. c. That leaves 133 million to do the work. d. There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work. e. Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government, leaving 19 million to do the work. f. 2.8 million are in the armed forces preoccupied with killing the Taliban. g. Which leaves 16.2 million to do the work. h. Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for state and city governments. i. And that leaves 1.4 million to do the work. j. At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals,  k. Leaving 1,212,000 to do the work. l. Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me. And there you are... Sitting on your ass, at your computer, reading jokes. Nice, real nice!! Now, I hate to ruin "numbers too good to be checked" with internet-verified facts (if it ain't on the internet, it ain't the truth!), but here's the real scoop, all documented with semi-reliable citations. And don't despair! The end result is even better than letting the original numbers go unchallenged.  a. The population of this country is 281 million. b. 40 million are retired and disabled, leaving 241 million to do the work. c. There are 72 million children, which leaves 169 million to do the work. d. There are 15 million in college, leaving 154 million to do the work. e. Of this there are 4.21 million employed by the federal government including military and post office employees, leaving 149.79 million to do the work. f. Take from the total the 18.6 million people who work for state and city governments, and that leaves 131.19 million to do the work. g. There are 2 million people in prisons. So relax, this still leaves 129.19 million diligent citizens, plus an increasing number of "undocumented workers," plus your Couch, to get everything done. Not only are you underworked -- you're totally superfluous! Take a break, for God's sake.   Interesting thoughts...  13. Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway.  12. Life is sexually transmitted, donâ€™t mean you need to reproduce.  11. Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.  10. Men have two emotions: hungry and horny. If you see him without an erection make him a sandwich!   9. Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.  8. Some people are like Slinkies... not really good for anything but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs.  7. Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.  6. Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.  5. All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.  4. Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars and a substantial tax cut saves you thirty cents?  3. In the 60's people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.  2. Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that the resemblance is exactly the same as the first.  AND THE # 1 THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:  You read about all these Terrorists. Most of them came here legally, but they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you are two days late with a video and those people are all over you. I think we should put Blockbuster in charge of immigration.
