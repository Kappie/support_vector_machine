Essentially, my history is quite sound. But science... I can honestly say I am quite screwed, I know a FEW things, but to study a whole year and a half worth of work? Quite impossible. Imagine how much I'll be whingeing when I'm in university (if blogger is still around, but it's highly probable that every single living thing on this planet will have a blog and be fluent in html. and php. programming and basic trigonometry.)  Once exams are over, I'll be planning to make a freeware game called "Revenge of the sadistic emoticon"  Anyway, I've started to listen to radiohead, Creep is such a good song. I recommomend them.   Well, happy 18th post. I hope this one lasts... I'd be glad once exams are over.  Cheers  Colin
