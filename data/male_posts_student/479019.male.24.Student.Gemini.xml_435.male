       
      I've been having the problem lately of waking up and my body not wanting to respond, because it felt like it just worked out hard. It's akin to the mornings after wrestling tournaments, only without the soreness. I think it's a combination of my eating habits, the bad weather, and lack of working out. In my sleep I'm restless because of that.  So as a result I ditched 603. I just couldn't pull myself up. I could barely hit the snooze button.  **
