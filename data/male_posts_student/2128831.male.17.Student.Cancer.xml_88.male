But I'll take the old lady and her crappy old toenails. Not at all what I would like to do. But I think that goes without saying.   NEWSFLASH: Charlize Theron got BEST ACTRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She is soooo awesome!  I mean seriously!     So I went to Illinois to visit family and decided to see The Passion of the Christ and there was this really hott boi that was working there, and so gay.  And anyways I liked him, and during the film I had to pee so off to the restroom walking past the boi.  While urinating their conversation is echoing into the bathroom about how I am cute and he should try for me and he brought it all to close with this comment:  “Yes he is sexy but he is a Southerner” So of course, like a Mondo fag, I start getting teary at the movies, and it wasn’t because of the film, not because I wish he was still here or that I wish I was else where, but because it further confirms the fear that made this weekend mildly crappy.  But then there are thoughts of Brent, ohh Brett.  He is really neat and spiffy and yeah!  I am the HAPPIEST boi in My world right now. Notice how I said MY world and not the world. Cause the world is a Hugemungous place and I'm sure that somewhere in it someone is happier than I am. For example, someone could have just given birth, or been told that they are in remission from cancer. You get the point.  And i will say it is life and Brent might be helping it as well...  Back to my happiness.     FRIEND OF THE TRUEST KIND A friend… Is someone who keeps your secrets and never divulges them, even if tortured--or worse, tempted with chocolate. Is someone who quietly destroys the photograph that makes you look like a beached whale. Is someone who knows you don't know what you're talking about, but allows you to reach that conclusion on your own. Is someone who goes with you on a diet--and off it too Is someone who doesn't say, "I told you so," no matter how tempting it might be. A friend of the truest kind is kind and true to you  [Zombies are eating my brains]  I have this absolutely inescapable fear of zombies, body-snatchers and the like. But I also have this absolutely inescapable masochism that forces me to watch movies about these phenomena, followed by not sleeping or functioning for two-three weeks. Anyway, I watched 28 Days later, which isn't really even that great (but the naked man was nice) but that doesn't stop me from being so scared I can barely go to my radio show (Random Radio w/DJ de Sade - 99.1 FM). During my sleepless nights staring at my bedroom door I came up with a theory. If ever zombies or something like them took over the world, I would be one of the last non-zombies alive. It's because of the way I play Dodgeball. Allow me to explain. Stay with me here. When I play dodgeball I stand in back and let everyone else get out until I am forced into the fight in lieu of no other team members. At this point lighting will strike (because I have all the balls on my side) (no pun) and I will lob a ball over to someone who isn't paying attention because they don't think I'm worthy of it, and they will get out. This will bring one of my team members back, etc.  Applying this theory to human destruction by zombies, I would just be hiding somewhere. I may not be a good fighter, or lucky, or even a minority - but I would be in the movie because I am a GD scaredy-cat. DO NOT underestimate my ability to sit completely still in one place with my eyes wide open for hours upon hours, perhaps even days. One snag in my plan is that I wouldn't be able to abandon my family and friends, but anyone who decided to stick with me and act like a rabbit who freezes in front of a predator would survive too. Eventually I would come out of hiding and one of three things would happen: 1.) I would find that one badass who survived by weaponry and skill, and they would take care of me because they were in need of human contact and/or sex. 2.) Lightning would strike and the zombies (or zombie-like creatures) would be outsmarted by some random shit that only I would do in that type of situation (perhaps pretending I was a zombie, too, or something equally absurd) and I would find that goddamn laboratory or wherever safety is... or (most likely) 3.) Die immediately, just slightly later than everyone else. I don't know if my theories are true, and hopefully I would never have to prove them, but I have a feeling I would survive due to my ability to wait shit out while holding my breath and slowly giving myself a heart attack.  Besides, the zombies wouldn't bother with me anyway, just like the kids in dodgeball. I'd probably just sneak by the peripheral-zombie vision and grab an explosive - "Hey, guys? What's this?" Those suckers will never see me coming.
