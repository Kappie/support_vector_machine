For those of you completely out of touch with reality, The Passion is the film that is supposed to save humanity from itself and turn us into anti-Semite. I like to call it the film that made Protestants realize Catholics might in fact be Christians.  Well, the DVD of the film is coming out on August 31, so our store is rolling out the merchandise in eager anticipation. This means the reincarnation of  The Passion of the Christ  jewelry. My favorite is the  urlLink Nail Lapel Pin . It's a solid pewter pin fashioned like a nail with the biblical reference Isaiah 53:5 carved into it.  You should really see all these  urlLink officially licensed products . It's one of the most frightening things I've ever seen. Who comes up with all this? And will a lapel pin really make someone become a Christian? If you ask me, it will just make people more cynical. Heck, I'm cynical about this, and I'm a Christian.  Luckily, many of my coworkers feel the same way. We decided to come up with more appropriate uses of these pins. There's the obvious golf tee. I thought it would be a cool nose ring. It would seem reminiscent of the bones you see in the noses of various National Geographic centerfolds. One person suggested using them to make a studded belt, but that idea seemed a little too labor intensive.  Now, if I could only figure out a better use for my  Left Behind  trading cards.
