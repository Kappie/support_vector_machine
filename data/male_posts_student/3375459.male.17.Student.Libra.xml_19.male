I wouldn't be this pissed off if its only one of his friends who dialed the wrong number, but this very morning, I had got 5 Indian callers (males  females) with different numbers looking for the same guy ( ABDU MALIQ  was what they repeated when I replied that they had go the wrong number). Tell me what are the chances of 5 person dialing the wrong number, but looking for the same guy? As slim a chance as to finding out how big is the universe, right? This clearly means that IDIOT had really been giving out my number.
