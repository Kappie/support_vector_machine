Ive missed her so much and I'm so glad that she is finally home. I love her so much! She went to Pennyslvania for a wedding, while I went to West Virginia to c my family and no, my family isn't like that. From wat I can tell she had a wonderful time and so did I . Though it would have been better if she could have came. I got drunk ( the one highlight of the camping trip)! I drunk Mike's Hard Lemonade, Smirnoff Ice, Bacarthy Silver ( Sp??), Jack Daniels, Budweiser, Bud Light, and some wine coolers that i didn't know the name of. I went swimming and all kinds of stuff while Kelly was rehearsing for a wedding a few states above me. Im so glad that im back. Ive missed her, my home, and my pets the whole weekend, but it was hard to leave my family after i had just meet some of them. From wat Kelly told me, it was hard for her to leave 2. I went up there and there was over 5 of my cousins that i didnt know, but i guess thats okay since my great grandpa had 18 kids! I had to expect not 2 know alot of the people there but i knew most of them. On our last night, which was Sunday, my Uncle Jeff was walking accross the road to the camping spots ( Him and my family were in the RV spot). Anyways while he was over there he heard my cousin Mary (17) in her tent with her bf gettin it on, so he walked back over 2 our campsite and we got some fire crackers. Then we went to their tent, tore it down and threw the firecrackers in the tent. It was so funny. Then when we were leaving that part we heard my other cousin (Grown) and her husband getting it on so we threw so firecrackers at them to. My Aunt Susie pulled a snake out of a tree while it was trying  to eat some baby birds. Then we beheaded it and put the body in my uncles truck. Then while we were swimming a big ass water snake swam near us so we squashed him with rocks but that didnt kill him. He swam back to the other side. I floated down the rapids and climbed up a mountain, while my dad was searching for me for over an hour. It was so funny. Im glad to be home                    I love you Kelly            5/10/04~infinity                                     LOVE SHANE
