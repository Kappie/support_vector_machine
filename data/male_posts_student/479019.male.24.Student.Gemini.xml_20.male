I simply had too much on my mind. I did surprisingly well on the alertness factor despite all that. I even managed to make it to work relatively on time... 3 minutes late.   Work was alright today. It was almost the same old story, except for the fact that the big wigs of the West Zone were in the office. Also my stomach was giving me problems, so I ended up dropping a load in the bathroom. Heh, quite an impression for the bosses eh?  Picked up a book left for me by my history professor at the history department... man is that sucker big. As if I don't have enough to read already!  Class was the usual stuff. More Popular Front culture and politics... only this time it was on dance. I'm not really into dance, so the subjects didn't really interest me. Speaking of dance. I'm not really getting the whole hand switching thing in my salsa class. It's kind of vexing.  The song of the moment is "Minstrel Boy" by Joe Strummer And The Mescaleros from  Global A Go-Go .  ***
