Ihave accually had quite a social life going on, which is good I guess... this weekend is the BUZZ RUN, and if you don't know what that is...too bad. Ok...it's something at my cabin, and my dad organizes a motorcycle race with like 30 people there every year... Isn't that crap? No not really...it's fun, and so many people! Too bad I can beat all the old people at racing tho... heh. Well anyways, this is a good and bad thing. It's good because it's loads of fun. It's bad because I am screwing up other plans for the weekend with other people. >.   Also, I have had a deal with my parents for so long that I would get A's in school if I didn't want to have to get a job... But now I just don't care anymore...I am going to get B's I hope and have a job. I can't stand school anymore. I can't beleive how close I was today to just standing up and walking out. I was serioulsy half way out of my seat a few times.. So why the sudden change? No it's not, I have been thinking about this for the longest time....and now I just don't care about grades. I used to aspire to get really good grades, get into a great college, and have the best job possible all for money. Now I think I will get decent grades and go to maybe some different college to study a foreign language, or art of some sort. Maybe theater director at SLP ;D. Well I just am not motivated to get good grades anymore...so hopefully I will have a lifestyle change for the better...And much more fun. Cuz that's what it's all about right? :D No need to answer that one
