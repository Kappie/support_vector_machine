Then had this muscle ache all over me, which was a total hindrance in the run. Then after that, we played floorball...yippee!!! But I'm on the losing team again. =( Nevermind la, i had fun anyway.  Shuts...didn't write my journal last night again...I think I enter here more even. At least I did my Quiet Time. Oh ya...was glad to hear from Yen. Hope she's doing fine. Then had my practise after school today.Wah...practise for 1hour, was so bored by the same old piece that I just decided to play something else...like canon!!! Tried to play until my fingers all ache. And made a decision...that is to learn piano. I've always wanted to learn it. It's the nicest instrument I think. And after that, I'll learn guitar! Then I'll know three instruments! Whoa! That's what I call music maker!!!hehe...ok...better go. But before I go, to all my brothers and sisters out there, persevere in faith!!!=)
