SO much life, so much real life that it starts to kind of sting.  That and the gym.  The gym stings sometimes because it feels like my knee-caps are going to fly OFF of my legs and hit someone across the room when Shawn decides that it's necessary for me to lift that much squat weight.    Between the sting of life and the sting of my legs (not to mention my arms, abs, etc.. which are all starting to look awesome if I do say so myself) I've been tied up.  That and being out of town for the last two weekends in a row.  Life REALLY does act funny sometimes.  I almost get irritated when it sneaks up and shows itself to be so real.  It's almost TOO cliche to be sitting there, feeling "older" than you ever have in your life simply due to the circumstances you're in.  You know, that feeling of "wow, this is what OLDER people talk about" when they say stuff like "it feels like just yesterday that.."  The truth is, it DOES seem like just yesterday that I got here, and now I'm leaving.  SO ready, but still seems fast.  It DOES seem like just yesterday that I met one of my best friends.  It DOES seem like just yesterday that me and that friend spent so many memories together that it would seem that separation would be impossible.  And it does seem like just last weekend, because it was, that this friend was watched, by me, walk down an aisle into marriage and away from my life.  I wonder if 12 years from now, the same amount of time (as of posting) that I have known this friend, if being greeted at the wedding reception like just another guest, will feel like "just yesterday."  I consider it the day I said goodbye.  Not that we wont talk again, but that a new chapter has started.  It's a funny position to be in when you're happy for someone, jealous, and sad all at the same time.  After not seeing someone that close in my life for a year, we would normally run, hug forever, and for all intents and purposes freak out for a while about how excited we were to see one another.  This of course can't happen when one of you is in a wedding dress.  (I don't wear dresses, so we're talking about her now).  It's just always weird to look into the eyes of someone you know better than possibly even the person she's marrying, and hear the words "I'm so glad you could come, it's so good to see you" as if you are an old high school friend, not "the man in my life" for the past several years.  I miss you so much, that it hurts, even though it's the best thing that could ever happen to you.  That is what covers up sadness that you'll never be my best friend, in the same way, again.  I miss you.  It's all so crazy.  In the darkest of dark moments last night, sitting staring at you (we're on a different "you" now, not the blushing bride anymore) on the floor last night, hearing you say that they all walk away.   Hearing you say that, in some such phrase, your parents don't support for long or for real sometimes and only do so with a condescending nature, made me express to you but more to myself that at this point in our lives "it's not about them anymore, we have to take care of ourselves."  I almost don't want to hear it.  I almost don't want to, myself, hear that it's me now.  At the same time, I do want to hear it, it's everything I have dreamed about since I was 7 years old.  Being an "adult" was what I wanted from the time I could fit into a suit and tie and follow my dad to his office to at least pretend I was one.  I am so excited about life, but cautious of her right now too.  You're fire that I'm excited to have keeping me warm and promising to do so in the future, but that includes the warning that when things get too real, burns may occur (oh and that I should "keep out of reach of children.. ")  Thanks for the promised warmth, life.    I am so thrilled to be starting my own life.  I want to, when I move, HAVE my own life.  I don't necessarily want to leave things and people behind, but I am ready to start a life for me.  I have never lived for myself in my life.  Please, don't take that away from me, life.  YOU either circumstance, I'm talking to you too.  I can't handle the idea of NOT having that satisfaction at 23.  I've waited so long to walk with you, life, and see what you feel like as a friend and foe.    "Living for me" never means that I am being selfish, or means to imply that I am such a selfLESS person that all my life I've just been some remarkable giver.  I do the best to be the best friend and person I can be, but I'm only human.  When it comes down to it, however, I don't necessarily put myself first in my happiness world, and that is not appropriate anymore.  I'm getting out of this post now, it feels claustrophobic.  I believe I will begin posting somewhere else soon.  A link that wont be given out, and will be BRUTALLY true and honest.  Wow, another something I would be doing for ME.
