Recapping bpay and tran man have crossed paths again.... in holy matrimony. GM-cHoWy aka Mr. Match raised bpay from death and helped tran man escape from a maximum security prison. He took them to a romantic tropical paradise off the coast of Timbuctoo, called Whoop Whoop. Mysterious remnants of a famous court room were found scoured around the island...   *Bpay: ahhh its such a wonderful day... my love*   *Tran Man: yes.... any day with u is wonderful, pure bliss*   *They gaze longingly into each others eyes, zooming out with a backdrop of the setting sun and the serene setting of waves melancholically crashing against the golden beach*   What heights of love will they reach on the next episode of Mabel of Tran   Benlee is not a girl, he simply lyks the show Girl TV which obviously isn't targeted at girls. He merely gives the false notion that he is, getting in touch with his feminine side which he obviously lacks, as we can see from his insecurities?!?!? did u get that???
