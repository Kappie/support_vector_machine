Will by far be the easiest trip of the summer to get a hold of people.  I mean its just...everytime I come home I find it harder and harder to leave because me and Meeta just keep getting better and better which Im NOT complaining about...I love it.  Its just I dont FEEL like leaving.  Its a forced trip which really sucks but I can see why my parents are forcing me to go.  My grandma will not live forever.  So yeah, mixed emotions about it but like I said, will be easy to communicate back home unlike the past two trips.  Just sometimes feels like I die when Im gone..."but Im dying to live"...good quote from a song...fits perfect right now. So yeah today me and Meeta went to see Spidey 2 finally.  I already knew that it wasnt that good and peoples descriptions fit perfect.  SOAP OPRAH!  Oh well, it was alright and spending time with Meeta was more than ok with me =).  Came back home and just chilled at my house till about 530 when Meeta left and yeah.  Had Dads birthday dinner and yeah...my dad is 45 today.  I dunno what to say about that...well hes not OLD! =)  Then went up to the church where I havent been in FOREVER so it was nice to see all of them and yeah.  Went out to ice cream with my dad for his b-day which was really good.  Im gonna get so fat...too much ice cream for me. =)  Then Meeta came over for just a couple mins to pick up her CDs that I re organized for her...I know that sounds weird cause like a guy re-organizing for a girl but yeah...they were messy! lol So yeah I do have one thing to talk about because hockey season is starting up soon and this year I have something else to inspire me to just gut through whatever comes my way and take any pain that I get...so listen up... While we were in England there was this man that started out on our tour...was about 75 years old and yeah...he looked a lot older though and yeah...he was from Austin and the day before we started on tour through the UK he got hit by a car on the streets of London.  Really kicked the crap out of him cause of his age and stuff.  I mean he could barely get around.  But he still did...even after a whole week of being beat up and seeing double he still stayed with the tour and saw everything and did all the walking and stayed on that cramped up bus.  I totally admire him for his strength and courage.  I mean he was still going strong, gutting through the pain, being sociable and yeah...it was purly amazing how strong he was.  Totally inspiring to anything that I do now...I mean he was so banged up and old.  If he can do that, I really belive that I can do anything with hockey...thanks George, you are truly amazing.   So yeah, I dont know if I will post any blogs while im gone on my last trip...we will see.  Cell is on and will be on AIM periodically.  Well im out....  "...but im dying to live...."
