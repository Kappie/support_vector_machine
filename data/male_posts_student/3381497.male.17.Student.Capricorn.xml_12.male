What's cool is that I don't have to wake up early cause I only have a second period. But I guess I'm gonna have to take gov't during the year, this sucks cause I'm probably gonna have to drop one of the classes I was hoping to take.   I woke up an hour early so could go early but I still had to wait for almost 3 hours to get scheduled. I had to stand with a bunch of incoming freshmen, I can't really stand all their gossiping and shit, talking about, "Ooh! *blah* is with *blah*. OMG!" I had to stand there with them since it was my cousin's gf's friends. They're pretty nice to me and shit, but if it wasn't for my cousin, they probably wouldn't even think of talking to me. Not that I would think of talking to them either, though. It's cool though I don't care to much, but every year, the new kids seem to get more and more irritating. God I'm gonna hate how school is gonna be. A bunch of little kids running around everywhere, thinking they're all that and a bag of potatoe chips.  Enough of that though. On happier news, it's my "friend"'s, b-day today, and she seems pretty happy recently. I just greeted her a few minutes ago on aim. I still haven't seen her in like 3 weeks, which sucks, and I haven't talked to her in about 2. It's nice to talk to her again.
