(sarcasm) I've got Mr. Whitman, the math teacher I had my freshman year (different) and some dumb kids in my class who I don't know/don't care for. Except one, who was my buddy in math last year! Yay! We sat together and protect each other from the disgusting masses. ;-) - 2nd period: (Adv. Drama 2) Welp, Mr. Davis won't be here till Monday. Hellacious sub-work to ensue. But everything's fine. Got my best homes wit' me.... and everyone I know and like. Just the Drama crew. [two minutes later] Oh, wait... who are  those  walking in the class? Are they supposed to be in here? Davis will have 'em kicked out within a week. I LOVE THIS CLASS! - 3rd period: (AP Lang/Comp) Yay! I get to stay in the same room for another hour with one of my favourite teachers. This is a tight schedule! And look, some of my buddies are here. This is awesome! - Lunch: Same group, same table. What a coincidence. Cool beans. - 4th period: (AP U.S. Hist) Well, got Mrs. Thurman. What?! A test? Well, I gots this crapola together. Got some good folks in this room. Good period. - 5th period: (Anatomy) Same story as first. I think they try to insult me with my regular classes. Dumb people... all but one. My friend/chica Lindsey! Well, we'll sit together. 5th will be a bucket of laughs. - 6th period: (AP Psych) One of my favourite classes. Gots some seniors up in this room. That's OK, I'm an upperclassman too. Got Mrs. Massey, some cool people.... nothing can go wrong with this class. Perfecto way to end my day.
