To the Mainland! 7/9 Friday was mostly a travel day for us, as we set out on a charter bus for Zhongshan. I spent the 2-hour journey next to Katie H., and I fell asleep for part of it. The fact that I was sitting next to Katie had nothing to do with that. I developed a slight cough during the ride; more on that later. The bus ride was quite exciting. Our driver apparently found no reason to heed traffic rules, as we sped down the highway honking smaller vehicles out of our way and using turn lanes to bypass traffic.  Zhongshan was a bit of a change compared to Hong Kong. More rural and impoverished, the city actually reminded me of what I have seen of Baghdad: kind of dirty and tattered, but plenty of somewhat modern buildings, roads and vehicles. Everything was much more spread out than in HK, and the roads were dotted with palm trees. We stayed in the Ma Ling village, which is second-world at best. However, our facility was palatial compared to the High Rock camp, with large bathrooms, plenty of space, as well as ping-pong and pool tables. A faux marbel fortress with a mote, the Friendship Home would keep us comfy for the next few days. We ate some authentic Chinese food at a local restaurant for dinner, then returned to the house to settle in.  "Free" Day 7/10 Saturday was a free day - the only scheduled activities were meals and a meeting to discuss what we would be doing at the government primary school Monday through Wednesday. I went to breakfast at a very small, and what we in the west would call an "unsanitary"  urlLink establishment . The dining room had 4 tables, the front was open to the outside, and the kitchen was not something I wanted to see. However, the boiled wontons were pretty good. Lunch and dinner were traditional Chinese: rice, chicken, pork, noodles, fried wontons, and assorted greens that I didn't touch. This type of meal would become standard fare for the balance of our stay in Zhongshan. We also had the opportunity to get some ice cream at a local shop, which was very refreshing.  Government Church or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Three-Self Movement" 7/11 Well, I don't really trust the Three-Self Movement, but Greg informed us that the government church we attended on Sunday actually had quite biblical teaching. I can't independently corroborate this, as the sermon was in Cantonese and translated into...Mandarin. Our fellow worshipers were very interested in staring at us, and I enjoyed an unofficial competition of breaking their gazes. It was very interesting to worship with people across the world in a different language, and at the end of the service we sang a few English worship songs for the choir. After the service, some on our team took the opportunity to go on house visits, but I was feeling exhausted and malaise, so I opted out for a nap back at the F-house. At night we continued to prepare for our activities at the government school. This involved me racking my brain to come up with a cheer and slogan for the group of kids Ethan and I would be leading, and we also made some paper birds and tangrams.  Govt. School Ministry and One Saved Soul 7/12 Monday morning we conducted some activities at the local  urlLink government school  with elementary aged children. First, we introduced ourselves and taught the kids "Old MacDonald". Then each American on the team worked with one HK university student leading a group of kids to come up with a slogan and cheer that would subsequently be performed in front of approximately 100 other students. My first group was the Blue Monkeys, and we repeated this once more with a different name, slogan and cheer. We became horses for the next round, and these proceedings produced a good opportunity to laugh at certain other team members, particularly one college pastor. We then left the school and ate lunch at a dive where we would become regulars for the next three days. Chicken was served with the head and feet, along with rice and other standard Chinese selections. Dessert was ho ho mei: fried sweet rolls with dipping sauce, and I would consume approximately 30 of these over the next three days.  Our evening ministry was at the Friendship House, and involved small group discussions with local kids. The purpose was to hopefully broach spiritual topics. I again was paired with Ethan, and he did translation for the 3 boys in our group, aged 13-17. Ethan was very eager to share the gospel with them after we dispensed with surface pleasantries, and he did so in Cantonese for about 10 minutes. I watched. After he was finished, I wanted to ask the boys some questions to determine how much of the gospel they believed. My first translated question to them was "Do you believe you have sinned?" One boy said "No", while the other two agreed that they had done some wrong things in their lifetime. I then had Ethan ask those two if they wanted to receive forgiveness from Christ for their sins, and they both were interested. I wanted to make sure that they understood that by praying a "sinner's prayer", they were not only receiving forgiveness and entrance to heaven, but making Jesus Lord of their lives. One boy was no longer interested. The final boy, a 17-year-old named Pui (Pooh-ee), still wanted to pray with us. Me, Ethan and Pui removed ourselves from the group, and I led Pui in a prayer to receive Christ with Ethan translating. We then shared a couple of verses with him as encouragement, and had a  urlLink picture  shot by Katie H. This event was by and far the high point of my entire two weeks in China. This is what I came for. Being able to see immediate fruit was a huge blessing, and I was very thankful for God's work that night.  Back to School 7/13 Tuesday we basically had the same schedule as Monday, except our activities at the school were slightly different. Instead of doing "cheers", two Americans were paired with each other and facilitated different activities in various classrooms. Each of our HK university students had a group of 8-10 kids, and they brought them to each of the classrooms to participate. I was paired with Tiffany, and we attempted to teach the children english color names with tangrams. The kids made different designs out of the tangrams, and they were pretty good at doing this, even to the point where we had to tell them to make a square in order to stump them. However, even this did not befuddle a couple of the students. After the school activities, we went to lunch, then back to the F-house to relax until the evening small group discussions. I took a nap, as my health was continuing to spiral downward. I skipped dinner that evening and stayed at the house to rest. Unfortunately, I was not even feeling good enough to participate in the group discussions, so I laid in bed and prayed and stared at the bottom of the top bunk.  Back to School and HK! 7/14 Wednesday was our last day in Zhongshan, and we conducted the precise same program at the school that we did on Tuesday. I was able to make it through the first round of tangrams, but during the break I went to the teacher's lounge and rested in a large, comfy leather chair. I planned on returning to the activities after the break, but I dozed off and when Greg came to get me I thought it best to just continue my attempts at sleep. The teachers in the lounge were extremely loud and did not stop talking for more than 15 seconds, so it was difficult to actually sleep, but I needed the relaxation. I was able to return to the assembly hall to say goodbye and sign autographs for the students however. That's right, they wanted our autographs, and I felt strangely comfortable signing them! :^D We had our last tasty lunch at the restaurant, and then it was time to head back to HK. The two hour bus ride back was brutal for me. I wanted to sleep, but the seating was cramped and I happened to pick the only window on the bus that didn't have a curtain, so the sun was beating down. Woe was me. Anyway, we got back to HK, and while everyone else went to eat dinner, Greg took me to his doctor. I told the doc that I had a history of sinus infections, and he decided to go ahead and give me antibiotics even though I didn't have a fever. He also prescribed several other meds, which came in little plastic ziplock bags with Chinese writing on them. After the doctor, I went back to the camp and tried to get a good night's rest for our final full day in China.
