(long story).. well to make a long story short.. all the lifeguards were like random people not in lifeguard clothes.. on thunderrun it was this like 12 year old kid.. so were all like uh.. its a gang.. lol... well hanna thought of it.. then we ate some food.. and susie and lauren got a huge snow cone.. it was like BAM in your face big.. lol we all had to eat some to finish it :-p... and then we dared Susie to drink the like jucie at the bottom.. lol it was like a mix of bubblegum, grape, lime, and cherry.. she got 1.50 for that hahaha.. she said it was kinda good.. even though lauren was like dying next to her when she died the bubblegum.. :-p  well.. that was during the day.. now its 2 AM lol more like 2:30.. me and phil found out something new about a friend (no names.. unless he/she doesn't care and i can add his/her name later..)lol even though phil was a little confused.. and then we got delirious.. and then phil left..so thats about all that happened today.. o  i watched Paycheck earlier.. that was pretty good i guess .. I kinda liked The Village too.. even though IT WASN'T SCARY!.. i just like the weird twist it had to the story.. that was kinda surprising.. well I guess I've written enough for today.. lalalalala back to doing nothing
