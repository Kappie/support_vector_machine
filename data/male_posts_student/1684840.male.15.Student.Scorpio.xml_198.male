The army and navy guys were pretty arrogant and again, like all hard ass 'intelligent' and 'authoritive' army people, had an attitude problem.  At dinner I bought some stuff from Tesco along with a notebook for people to write stuff in as my last day at school might be Monday (going france Tuesday and might not be returning after the 6 weeks holiday!)  I got loads of cool stuff written in it so far and hopefully more on Monday.  I've bought a brand new amazing camera from eBay and if it arrives before or on Monday I will be able to get pictures of people too!  (If not I can use my old camera, which isn't as good)
