Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy and you sure don't look like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down. General: How tall are you private?   Soldier: Sir! 5 foot 9! Sir! General: 5 foot 9! I didn't know they stacked shit that high, you trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere huh!?!   Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Are you a Peter Puffer?   Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Bullshit! You can probably suck a golf ball out of a garden hose... Do you suck dicks!?  Soldier: Sir! No! Sir! General: Are you shook up, are you nervous!?   Soldier: Sir! Yes I am! Sir! General: Do I make you nervous!?   Soldier: Sir! General (immediatly after the soldier said 'Sir!'): Sir what!? Were you about to call me an asshole!?   **General Hartman punches Private Cowboy in the stomache**  Oh god, that movie is hilarious. I forgot to mention Chris slept over two nights ago and we watched Full Metal Jacket, I've seen that movie so many times, it gets funnier and funnier each time! The wedding today was boring. And I missed the party in Cornwall...this is definetly the shittiest summer ever.
