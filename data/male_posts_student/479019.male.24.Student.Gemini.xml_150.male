I also did some chatting with Flo and played some Age of Empires. I really need a new game to play...  Today I woke up around noon, made lunch for myself and my brother, then went to the bookstore and washed my car. I also ordered a book on-line. Not really sure what else I'm going to do until I watch Smackdown with the posse.  ***
