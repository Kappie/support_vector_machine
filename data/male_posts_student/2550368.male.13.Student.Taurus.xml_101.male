I went go carting (3 rounds) the first round I had the best car but then I got screwd the second two but I made the most of it by going out far enuf to let a car pass by me but then right before they came to my rear I would swerv realy fast closing off there way to pass me and they would slow down. I also went mini-golfing and we bloth sucked. It was so hot out we only did like 1 and a forth. Then we played video games ($4 worth). We did r0x0r at the game we played. Then we went in the batting cadges and he r0x0red and I sux0r3d. Now I am at Mikey Z's house and I am spending the night.  PS: I made a nice template today but I cant upload the images untill I install Office XP so I can read my old email with my password in it. *UHG*  Lates, Jeff
