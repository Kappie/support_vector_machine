Things are going to go back to full speed tomorrow, even with brand new stuff at Digital Lust.  But, enough about that.  Let's talk about driving.  There's good news.  I passed driver's ed, like I thought I would.  Bad news, Alex did.  Haha, just kidding.  Actually, he did better than I did.  Caitlin, however, shockingly, did not do better than me or Alex.  I'm not going to say she's a "bad driver," but, she has needed much improvement before she can get her license, and this was the perfect chance.  She came a long way since we started yesterday.  She had to drive I-75 through a really bad storm, and she was having a hard time seeing the road.  But, we managed to survive, it was good experience for her, and us, and we enjoyed ourselves.  Driving through I-75, for me, wasn't an entirely difficult experience, but, it wasn't that easy either.    We spent the whole day in Ocala, pretty much.  Saw a lot of the places that I used to go when I lived there.  I drove through downtown for the first time... worst traffic I'd ever gone through.  My biggest flaw in driving is parking, though.  I'm really bad at it.  I didn't hit anything, but, my parking job has to be the worst part of driving, in my opinion.  So, driving went well, I can have my will pulled now and have it modified sometime in the future (who gets my blog???).  Now, all we have to do is look forward to camp, which is next week, as stated several times.  I think the rules that Mrs. Yearbook Advisor set up are fair, and I guessed something happened last year at camp that she didn't like, and I didn't know about it until today.  She also has to take into account recent events that happened at the middle school, where there was some big alcohol-related thing, and one teacher got fired because of it.  I think she has to definitely have some things cleared up in writing.  It's all common sense what she said, but, in writing, it can make discipline matters for anyone who were to do it much worse...which they would deserve.  But, she wants us to have fun, too, so, we're going to do that.    I guess Blogger is going to be down for maintainance around the time that I normally have a Late Night Bloggin' segment, so I won't be having one again tonight.  I'll try and get on later with a lyrics post or something else, I dunno, but, if I don't, you know I'm sleeping.  So, until later, see youse later.
