I've actually never really kept a journal on a regular basis before; however, in looking back on the past, I wish this was something I had done on a regular basis.  The thought on doing this first crossed my mind back in the fall of 2003.  Entering my senior year of track here at UC, I had this sense that the upcoming season was going to be something special.  I thought it would be neat to chronicle the daily ups and downs of the season and reflect back on it sometime down the road.  Turns out the season was something special as we won the Conference title and were undefeated as a team for the entire season.  We were definitely the best track and field team ever here at UC.  I personally had a pretty decent year, but it certainly had its ups and downs.  Unfortunately, I never did really get started on that journal, but I do plan on doing some entries down the road reflecting back on the season while the memories are still fresh in my mind.  So I am currently one week away from being down with college.  As with the case of numerous people I've talked to, I was ready as ever to get out of here and onto the real world up until about two months ago.  Now, I don't really want college to end.  Strange, eh?
