(Why are fresh tears flowing?) White roses all around us now (A little prayer, signaling the end) I made my way to the centerpiece And saw our own faces staring from the glass Are we dying? Have we outlived ourselves? Are we gone? Has our flame burned itself out? (Why are fresh tears flowing?) White roses all around us now (A little prayer, signaling the end) Enter the wake of our design A funeral to end the last embrace Enter the wake of our design A funeral to end the last embrace Are we dying? Are we the departed? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ sorry, but when a song is as persistent as this one has been with me, i really have no other option. i've been feeling punkish lately. no, not hardcore punkish; pop punkish. like shallow graves right there-- that has a punkish element. so does all downhill from here, ocean avenue, stuff like that. yeah!  oo nga pala, i-phphase out ko na siguro yung what have i learned chenes. if anything, i feel like i'm getting dumber by the day.  nanghihinayang talaga ako dun sa libreng ticket ko para sa concert ngayon sa peyups, yung kasama sa survival kit. alam ko namang hindi pa huli ang lahat, pero nakakatamad lang talaga. *sigh*... i would have liked a channel for my angst though (other than my blog i mean)...  what is with today's weather? one minute i'm melting inside the canteen at vinzons and the next i'm standing in the middle of the as parking lot drenched in the rain. i can practically feel myself getting sick already. oh joy, i get to stay home and complain about how much my life sucks all day long; you, dear reader, truly are blessed.  nanawagan ako sa kung sino mang tao na kakilala kong maaaring nag-suggest sa akin na itawag sa varsity namin ay "UP Fighting Morons". ok ka tsong, whoever you are.  i'll never understand how the students of the self-proclaimed creme de la creme of all universities in the philippines can be reduced to stark raving lunatics in a split-second over something as idiotic as a game of basketball. sure, this kind of behavior is expected from complete and total airheads who can only ask who slept with who, but from the spectacled, freckled, drooling, muselage-concealing nerds that reside in us all? argh! my world is crashing down before me!!!  i have no idea why we, or anyone for that matter, even have to do crap like that. am i really the only person who realizes our MVPs are the players of NU? that said with my limited knowledge on this whole subject should be quite offending, you know. yes, i did just explain my previous statement; i imagine the people who ought to take offense at it are too dense to interpret my words otherwise.  i'm gonna make this as simple as i possibly can-- it eludes me how people who are supposed to be intelligent can be so moronic at the same time. i know, a year in the star section should have answered that question for me, but it really hasn't. but then, the instigators really aren't those of us who read books, right? most of the people who set this fucker off are the ones who slipped right in thanks to their "tito alex" or their "tita nene".  i'm sure that, from your perspective, this isn't really a major crisis or anything, is it? well, it is for me; i don't like having to conform. i hate conformity. i just want to be the lonely, angsty, addicted-to-rock teenager that i am, for the moment at least while it is still justified. because really, when you're 17 you're still expected to screw up and be as stupid as is humanly possible, but when you're 18 you're a bonafide adult. your screw-ups don't amount to seatmate x whispering to former classmate of cousin's gardener's best friend's half-brother-in-law anymore, they  now lead to ate inday completely blowing the story out of proportion while telling it to manang sari-sari store.  i hate happiness. i hate love. i don't believe in sunshine. there is only rain... only eternal rain...  completely wrong thought of the day: what, my entry wasn't wrong enough for you? ok, well, there is something i picked up from somewhere...  "torment is never quite as enjoyable as when one is in love."  *hem hem wink wink hem hem* yun lang.
