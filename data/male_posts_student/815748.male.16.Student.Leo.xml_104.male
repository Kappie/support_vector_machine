I thought France was really sucky, since there was nothing to do but homework and even that I could barely do since my guy was playing this horrible game on the computer for ten+ hours.  Today, I would still prefer Newton - where I have my own computer and can speak my own language and don't have to stay up until one in the morning to talk to Dan freakin' Jung and have actual food and good TV and Coca-Cola and root beer and heat and baths and my cat - but I think I can bear France for another week and a bit.  My homework is coming right along.  I finally wrote my Oedipus essay today.  I'm fairly sure I can finish all my homework assuming I do little else for the rest of the time, except for chemistry for which I lack the textbook and any conception of what I'm supposed to do.  Despite what you may have guessed from my last post, though I can't do anything in France, my chances are looking fairly good for Jewton.  Except for that one thing that I'm repulsed by.  Oh well, there's no one else I would like more, even if I hadn't learned that a certain someone wanted to castrate me.
