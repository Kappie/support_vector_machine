How many guests will you be checking in?  Ah, good.  We have  just enough  rooms for you... Please follow me to the library...  Ah I'm sorry to say that your rooms are not quite ready yet.  Please feel free to browse our library as we have a wide selection of books--  ::TV turns on::   "You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sound. A dimension of sight. A dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into...The Twilight Zone."    "Hollywood, 1939. Amid the glitz and the glitter of a bustling, young movie town at the height of its golden age, The Hollywood Tower Hotel was a star in its own right; a beacon for the show business elite. Now, something is about to happen that will change all that. The time is now on an evening very much like the one we have just witnessed. Tonight's story on The Twilight Zone is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. This, as you may recognize, is a maintenance service elevator still in operation, waiting for you. We invite you, if you dare, to step aboard because in tonight's episode, you are the star. And this elevator travels directly to...The Twilight Zone."    ::TV turns off::  Attention valued guests, your rooms are now ready.  I'm dreadfully sorry but our main elevators are currently out of order at this time.  If you will please follow me down to the boiler room, we will load you onto our service elevators...  Ah here we are, the service elevator.  Please watch your step as you board.  We here at the Hollywood Tower Hotel are committed to the utmost safety for our valued guests.  Any questions?  Good.  If you need anything, anything at all, please do not hesitate to scream.  I hear your rooms are on the 13th floor. Lucky, the view I heard is simply  to die for . Do enjoy your stay...   "DING!"    "You are the passengers on a most uncommon elevator about to take the strangest journey of your lives. Your destination unknown, but this much is clear, a reservation has been made in your name for an extended stay."   "Wave goodbye to the real world."   "You have just entered the Twilight Zone. What happened here to dim the lights of Hollywood's brightest showplace is about to unfold once again."   "One stormy night long ago, five people stepped through the door of an elevator and into a nightmare. That door is opening once again, but this time, it's opening for you......"    urlLink My Tower of Terror Report   urlLink WDW ToT Tribute page   urlLink California ToT Grand Opening ceremonies   *California ToT pictures coming soon*
