All my atempts to get the movie in .avi format where in vain, the user kept disconnecting.   Over and all i had a crappy day. I'm not in my best mood and peoples keep puting me to my limit. May have something to do with my  Gatty  moving even more farther from me. I hate life.   Well, i should be happy and everything about  Canada  and all, but i'm, not at the moment.  Regards,  Zephyr
