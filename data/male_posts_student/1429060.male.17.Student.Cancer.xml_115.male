Watch me learn them word by word:   Gollum is Smegol King I is regal Basshead for the precious Smeagol fly like an eagle  Precious is my bling-bling Precious gonna sing-sing Precious on my finger Nasty hobbits no sting-sting  My pimp stick a missin' Redrum on a mission Don't fuck wit the Gollumses playa Playa we be fishin'  Me wants it Hobbitses stole it Power to the Playa And the Gollum who controls it  The Towerz are the Playaz The Towerz are the Playaz all  Skills with the grooves Middle Earth have you heard the news? Gollum drop a beat that even Orcses even use  Sauron and Smegol Kitty full of evil Jumpin' down to D-Town Smegol get medieval  My drawers are hangin' light I'm stuffin' up my pipe Spliffin' and a splashin' I'm steppin' to the mic  Gollum is Smegol King I is regal Basshead for the precious Smeagol fly like an eagle  The Towerz are the Playaz The Towerz are the Playaz all.   Holla out, lotr fans.
