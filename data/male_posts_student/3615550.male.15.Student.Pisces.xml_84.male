The reason for that is that I am just weary of it; it's nothing but lies and distorted truths, and there are so many of them that I really don't want to take the time to refute Mr. Moore.    urlLink David Sessions , however, has seen the movie and written an exceptional article about it.  Here's the good part:  his article as included on the front page of  urlLink The Rant !  The article is called  urlLink Propaganda Comes To Town , and I recommend that everyone read it.  Great job, David!  Keep up the good work!
