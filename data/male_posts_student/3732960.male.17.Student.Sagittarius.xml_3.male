Im not a big fan of the whole harry potter craze either, same with all that Pokemon shit... never liked it at all. I played it once, and had absolutely no idea what anything meant, so i stopped. Fun things are easy to follow. No complicated story lines or any of that shit. Unless youre talkin about the movie memento... now there was a good complicated movie. ive seen it like 5 times now. im listening to "Control" by Puddle of Mudd.... just thought id share. im headin out for a smoke.... be right back (11:22 pm)ok im back (11:26 pm) well that was fun. i've got "Broken" by seether playing now.. good song. My friend Becky is hilarious. she always tells me that the first time she heard me talking was when i was talking to this other girl about drugs and she thought to herself "i hope that kid never talks to me" now we're best friends. I think we get along so well cuz we're both really sarcastic.. about EVERYTHING!                            *AIM CONVERSATION* me: i hope your watching TV er something, cuz i dont have one with cable in here, so if it says somethinglike hey get in yer basement tornado to the fullest... i wouldnt know becky: lol becky: tornado to the fullest becky: is that like the BET weather channel  BET is black entertainment television for all you out there who don't know that. *wink*   i hate living in a small town... and i hate being in high school (only one year left thank god) you're so sheltered from everything, and i hate being naive.
