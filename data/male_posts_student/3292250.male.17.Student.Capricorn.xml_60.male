From a young age we buy into advertising and media image and society's perfect example of what you should be. Movies and television do the same. Now I've been cynical of this in the past and said that people worry too much about their image and that it doesn't matter, but I have come to the realization that if you're unhappy with who you are, you can do something about it.  And that's just what I'm going to do. I don't feel like I've got the right image for my personality. No, I'm not going to become a woman. Don't worry. But I am doing everything I can to become who I want to be (within reason, of course). The way I see it, I'll be much more happy if I look the way I want, and I'll have more confidence in everyday life. I don't want to be the new kid, the new senior, and the overweight fag next year. A simple "fuck what they say" attitude won't do it. If I'm going to realize my broadcast journalism career I need to be confident. If I'm going to do what I've always wanted and so musical theatre I need to look and feel like I belong up on stage dancing around and having a fabulous time.  So I've got a plan. It's going to take effort on my part, and some definite training to avoid those foods I eat to often. I actually prefer water and Diet Coke anyways, so that's going to be easy. I'm getting out and walking/jogging/running at least once a day for 50-60 minutes, and I'm going to do whatever else I can to take care of what I need to do. Once I do, I'll be so much more fabulous and so much more myself than I am now. Sure, I'll be a lot more gay looking, but that's who I am and want to be. I don't give a damn what anyone else thinks because I'm damn proud of who I am and will be.
