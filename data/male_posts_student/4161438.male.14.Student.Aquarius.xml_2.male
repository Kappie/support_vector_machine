Once punk was classified as a style, punk was no longer punk. You cannot be punk if you go to you a store that sells punk clothing exclusively! Punk cannot have a standardized color of pink and black! The noncorformists have conformed! So, all of you who are punk, stop! Be something else! Wear silk sheets dipped in black paint or some crazy thing! But don't be punk, because being punk is a goddamn oxymoron.  By the way, goth is a still pure style. Goths are nonconformist, sure, but that isn't really what they're all about. They're about being dark. So that's all right. If the whole world is dark, the real goths don't care. They just do what they want.  For those who mix the goth style and the punk style, stop. You annoy me. At least those who do it on purpose. They are kinda close, so similarities are bound to occur, and that's all right. But you can't be a goth with spiked jet black hair with pink tips. That isn't being dark, that's being a spectacle.
