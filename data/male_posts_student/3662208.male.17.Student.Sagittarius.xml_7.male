I've nothing important to say, nothing to really complain about other than finding out that I've actually seen a plan in motion to put ID chips in the homeless. Which is bullshit. I mean who the hell are these people to go around putting chips in people, just because they think it protects the "others." Well, I'm of like a prom dress.
