       
      I managed to photocopy and mail stuff, and get some writing done today. I have roughly 3 pages left to get done for 602. I wonder if I can just proof read and send it. I mean... 3 pages in the scope of 30 isn't that much.  I'm gonna go out in a bit and I'm just killing time for now on the computer with a cup of Earl Grey (Jean-Luc Picard's drink) at my side.  ***
