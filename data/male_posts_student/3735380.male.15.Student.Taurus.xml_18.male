That might serve as proof.  -----------------------------   Part I   The Mayans were a celestially based civilization established before their end. Before they were conquered, they had created such precise measurements of eclipses and other celestial events that, even today, they are only thirty-three seconds off.  The Mayans predicted the world will end on December 23rd, 2012.  Their celestial measurements were only 33 seconds off. Will this one be also?  -----------------------------   Part II   About two millenii (Latin plural for millenium) ago, the bible was completed.  A Jewish rabbi discovered that if you took every other 50 letters in the Torah, it would spell out the word "Torah".  Years ago, Isaac Newton's roommate discovered the bible and hundreds of notes on Newtons desk. When asked, Newton said that the bible may be the key to unlocking the future. He was right.  Later on, today, scientists and mathematicians have input the bible into computers. The mathematicians were startled when they discovered that the bible is not only a collection of stories, but it's also can be input into a computer program too.  Scientists have already discovered the Even Spacing Generator, meaning it takes every Xth letter for Y amount of times. They discovered that the bible is also like a crossword puzzle.  At the end of the world, the Bible Code predicted there will be six years of oppression, starting 2006, followed by the end of the world by nuclear war on December 2012.
