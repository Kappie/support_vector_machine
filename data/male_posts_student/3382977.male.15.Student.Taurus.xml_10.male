I had a quick breakfast and then Lily, Robert and I decided to go take a "mega-walk"...which is a huge long walk with the dogs ( Koosh, Krack, and Boomer ( if you care )).   so we go up to the top of mount Davidson and hang out there for a while, come back down, and then go home and stuff...have some lunch, and then we decide to go back up since lily lost her glasses ( these really expensive nice sunglasses ) ... so without the dogs we go up and check it all out...and then Lily decides to go on the bus for no reason at all ( she claims it is relaxing )...so we check out the 43 bus and start riding it....wow, that was the most relaxing ride of my life...are you kidding, the bus is the worst place to ride around for 2 hours for no reason....well, we get to lilys house, have a pizza, and now im here with a huge head ache and very tired...ho-hum...
