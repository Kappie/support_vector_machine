Particularly from the RAF/ATC stand I was working on. I have compiled a complete list of everything free I got from the weekend-  RAF Careers Wallet (in a rather gay powder blue) Stickers of various RAF planes x about 20 An RAF Roundel Badge 6x little fluffy things with the sticky feet One poster of a plane I can't quite identify One RAF pen One Northampton College pen RAF "Way of Life" CD Bendy rubber thing RAF Bottle Opener RAF roundel Keyring Northants Police keyring RAC "Drive Alive" keyring Multiple Del Monte fruit drinks Multiple Banana Milkshakes (from the Nintendo Konga Beach Tour) One free slice of goodfellas pizza various free bits of cheese Several RAC sweets and last but certainly not least nearly a dislocated neck.  The story behind the last one is quite simple. At the (excellent, may I add) Nintendo Konga Beach tour, there was an attraction called "Mario's Surf Run". It was basically a large inflatable alleyway with an elastic rope at the end. you were strapped to the rope, given a few bananas, and told to place them as far down the alleyway as you could. Excellent fun. And then you had all the fun of being twanged backwards at high speed. However due to my own daftness, I flipped right upside-down, bounced around my head as one would on a pogo stick, and then fell over. It didn't hurt a bit when I did it yesterday, but now it hurts when I look too far in either direction and when I yawn. Oh well, it was still excellent fun (and may I add that I totally destroyed Mark Longland's banana-placing record).  I also bought a mirror on a stick (for nitexs and for being a pervert) and a magnet on the end of a stick (for picking things up and irritating people). And a chair. For sitting on (duh!).  And I gave away umpteed million stickers to small children. The greedy little cunts. And I may have recruited someone to our squadron. We'll have to see if he turns up to our next intake.  Balloonist friends of my father didn't turn up, curse them. So I didn't get a single chance to blag a free flight. Or to run across the arena, pursued by security guards. Oh well.
