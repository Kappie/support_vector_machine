I was timekeeper for the first intra-class debate of the year for our class, but everyone wanted to play with the bell and so there was a mad rush to press it and listen for that "ting". They would hear plenty of it later in the debate so I wonder why they were so curious for... And this was a sec 2 classroom! Wahaha... Now you people know how our class is. I nearly got thrown by Mao Wang today, and almost got pounded by Yu Tong (class monitor aka "thinker" or Zhu Lao Shi), but I managed to run away, but those are just normal class things. That's what you get when you put 3 judokas, 2 taekwando guys and 1 wushu guy in a class room plus a lot of violence-inclined youngsters. No other class, not even 2A can measure up to our discipline (we don't have any in the first place). 2A is the slacker class, pretty much a complement of our class, which explains why we are on such "good terms". 2C is the most "wu liao" class... Just confused and plain lost, but I never said ill-disciplined. My muscles hurt like crazy... Yesterday I was flag-bearer and was waving the flag right to the very end of the competition and man, was that flag heavy! It ain't easy waving that flag as high as possible all the way throughout the competition! But I think I was formidable enough against even all of the Chinese High flag-bearers put together (the product of ego). They may have won, but I claim a moral victory!
