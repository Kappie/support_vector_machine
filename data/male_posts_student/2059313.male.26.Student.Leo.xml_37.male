We can dream of a better life, or dream of one day getting that job, or that we'll win a very important prize one day.  Now the kind you dream at night tell us a lot about ourselves, if we can understand them.  Sometimes dreams are pretty messed up.  Last night I had a dream that I was working somewhere along side this girl... it's not anyone I knew, or recognize from real life... but I felt like I knew her in my dream.  She was cute, she had short dark brown hair and was apparently very attractive to me, and I guess I was to her.  We talked a lot, and we were talking, and talking, and it seemed that we had a lot in common, and at one point I just leaned over and kissed her, and we clicked.  MAN did we click.  I don't know if this was just my mind and my heart communicating and God telling me, "She is out there" or if it was just one of those tricks our mind likes to play on us because it's something that's been rolling around in there for longer than it should be.  It was nice, and real, and very comfortable.  And then I woke up, and I felt empty.  Like the one great love of my life had been taken away from me. And as I laid there half awake trying to remember her, a thought came over me.  You're never going to experience that, truly.
