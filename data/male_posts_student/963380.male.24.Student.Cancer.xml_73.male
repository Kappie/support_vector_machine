First there was Rob Bannerman, with whom I could do no right. Whenever I wanted to watch TV, he wanted to watch TV. When I had friends over, they were unwelcome, whenever he had friends over, it wasn't my place to complain. Next there was Meredith and Rob. The second Rob I got along with just great (we had one fight - physical - and after I picked him up from the hospital, we were doing just fine). Meredith was the bitch to end all bitches. Simply the most aggravating person I've ever encountered. Didn't like any of my friends, felt it was her place in front of my TV - and expected me to fuck off anytime she wanted it, even though she welched on the god damn bill more times than I can count. BITCH.  Then there's John. It's a conundrum, because John I like. But sometime around September, he decided that the car that his father had given him was no longer good enough for him. The passenger seat was broken - instead of repairing or replacing the seat on the vehicle (95 Buick with 300 Hundred K on it.) So he bought an Acura RSX Premier. Rang in at around $32, 000 after taxes. It was at that point that he decided that he simply couldn't afford to live with me anymore. Naturally I was confused, felt betrayed and was leaking furious all over the place. So we came to an agreement. He would pay rent and utilities, as we had agreed to earlier. I'm not sure how this was saving him money, but I didn't ask. After all, I, as roommate/friend, was not consulted a single time. But meh.  So a few months go by. I get paid rent. Utilities seem not to matter to him. He now owes me $600 in utilities. $150 a month is what we agreed on, even that's not the 50% we had originally set down.   Then I come home today and just about everything is moved out of his room. I suppose I feel better about that then seeing almost two grand worth of electronics sitting there being unused. Then again, if he decides to welch on me, there's not much left to pawn. The fact that he did it while I was away at work and didn't even mention it to me - well that feels sneaky. I get the feeling my next conversation with John may not be as pleasant as I'd like.  Then again, if I'm getting fucked here, don't any of you, my readers, think I'll take it lying down. I like John. He's my friend. But I'll be less of a human being if he thinks that I'll just let a couple of thousand dollars fly.
