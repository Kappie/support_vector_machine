It was by no means a one-way conversation though. A bunch was being said by me. In any event, I woke up late.  Then I called my neighbor who's litterally, like, across the street and asked her if she could come over to clean the guinea pig cage. She gets payed like 5 dollars a visit and the visit is like once a week for less than 10 minutes. I'd do it myself, but I have a VERY light stomach and I once threw up all over the place when I tried to clean it myself. When we first got it, I had a heavier duty system and when I couldn't do it, my mom or sister would do it, but since I got meningitis a couple years back, I haven't been able to do it. Funky, huh?  Moving on, I then went to her place after being invited for lunch. It was pretty good, but I forget that I have this thing with eggplant that also makes me throw up. I don't know what it is about it, but it just rubs me the wrong way and I gag whenever it comes in contact with my tongue unless it's, like, cooked this special way. Again, that's kinda odd isn't it? Well, after hanging around her house for a while, she got bored and wanted to play cards, but I don't really like cards so I brought something from my place to entertain myself between the turns, my guitar. It was fun to play because people seem to really get into dudes with guitars, especially ones who play. So, I'm playing a little song and her family comes back from their walk and they all want to hear so they all gather around and now I'm really nervous and mess up on like everything, but I manage to make jokes that cross the italian language barrier because I managed to have them laughing by the end of it. I had a good time, anyway.  After that, let's see, I had to go because Sara (my neighbor) had to take a shower and well, it's not proper to just hang around when she's in the shower so I left and hung around the house, played some more guitar, talked to Christina for the littlest bit, made the Guess The Song IV post, and actually did something productive (in the formal sense of the word), but forgot what.  Then after all of this action, I got a phone call from my dad that interupted my conversation with Christina, but I'm talking to her as I write this post, so it's all good :-), asking me if I wanted to go to dinner with him and Ali (the ultra cool, ultra geeky, awesome dude) at John Harvard's. I accepted and took a bus over to Harvard Square and ended up waiting for a bit while they were late. Eventually they came and we went in and ordered and the like. We talked about some business stuff and computers and computers related to business stuff and just some purely random things.  Then, after dinner, we walked over to the Media Lab where I ended up waiting around most of the time, but it wasn't a bad thing. Ali and I got to talk about stuff and I ended up learning some stuff about processor architecture. Man, now THAT is a really cool field to get into... if only I had the patience to go through the boring math required for it. Oh, we also went over to talk to this other person we know, her name is Jacky. She's from England and is also highly cool. We talked about the economy, bush, world war 2, stalin, home-owner's insurance, cheap generic viagra, and diplomas without the work. I'm going to go see Fahrenheit 911 with her sometime soon... I think. That's at least what  she  said.  And so, after a little while of talking to her, I went back to my dad's office where he's been updating his computer and installing some apps that he'll be needing. It really is a lot of fun staring at progress bars for like 2 hours. Anyway, he wasn't done so I sat down on one of the couches and realized that I could sign on to AIM and check my e-mail and add to my blog with any of the bajillion machines sitting around here. After checking my mail and continuing a conversation with Christina, I started this post in my blog. I'm still talking to Christina now and my dad's waiting for me to get off the machine now so that we can go, but whatever. He's managed to busy himself now :-). I think that just about covers it.  I imagine that the last hours of the day will go down something like this, though: We'll walk over to the elevator, we'll wait for a bit, we'll take he elevator down and walk out of the building, through another building, and across a parking lot to get to our car. We'll get in, I'll put on my seatbelt and ask my dad to put his on, but he probably wont listen and will turn on NPR. We'll start to drive off and I will sit in the passenger seat awkwardly as I wished the radio was set to something more entertaining or at least less... monotonous or off so that I could tell him what was on my mind. Then we will finally arrive at home and I will check my messages on my mac and maybe reply to a couple of them briefly so that I could get to bed as soon as possible. Then I will probably brush my teeth and wash my hands. And finally, of couse, I'll take off my socks, shoes, over-shirt, shirt, and pants (in that order) and lie in bed until I fall asleep.  It's such a routine now that I think I should do something to make it more interesting, but knowing me, nothing will really happen. I'll pretend to make a change, but will get too lazy to fix it. Damn, I even know where I'll fail in an attempt to fix the problem! This sucks. I am now sad.   That is all. -- Feanor
