Ithink im going to do the same tomorrow but watch a different movie instead. Heres my work schedule for the next few days:  Sunday: 5-11 Monday- Dont work Tuesday- Dont work Wednesday- 5-8 Thursday- Dont work Friday- Dont work Saturday- 5-11 Sunday- 5-11  Thats how my schedule usually is but i dont really complain about it unless i dont want to work. Ive been thinking about it and my summer has been going very very well. I get to see my friends alot, i get outside the house, i have money. Yeah i would say my summer is one of the best ones ive had.  I like my friends, and i noticed all my friends like my room, they say they want it or it is cool or " wish i had your room do you want mine?", i like it when people come over and hang out in my room. Brittany and Vanessa have been coming over at like 11 and have been leaving around 2 something, all we do is stay in my room, its cool because.......my room is cool haha. I wish they would get back from florida so we can chill in my room at night! haha  Im watching Predator, its a very good movie. I cant wait for a.v.p (Aiens Vs. Predator) it looks like it will be a good movie (in my opinion).  Has anyone noticed that all of my posts are nothing of real importance? there just kind of pointless and dont really mean anything.
