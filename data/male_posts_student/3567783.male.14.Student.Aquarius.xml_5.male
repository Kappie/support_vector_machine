You imagined yourself being with your Mr/Miss Perfect, enjoying your lovely moments together, or getting everything that you wanted in the world, living in a luxurious house in a beautiful scenery, with the wind blowing softly on your face, and the birds chirping, and your house overlooking the sea.  Well, let's imagine the other version of the above description. You're living in hell, blood drips on your walls, there are rusty chains and weird, sick twisted monsters everywhere. You're lost, lying down on the floor, confused, terrified, and your mind seems like it's going to burst anytime soon.  ...  Maybe I've been playing too many horror games at the moment >_  I seem to be getting out of the purpose of my blog, am I not?  Well, school starts today. It's normal, no big difference, except that I only have two days left to do the dumb History folio. Habibah is THE *****. Exams starts next week, this school is so screwed up (other schools have their exams before the holidays). Oh, and Grace got herself frameless specs. She looks prettier in it. I wonder if my parents are gonna repair my frameless specs at all (it's been two months) >_
