It's rather amazing how many people we've met since we moved here. (I make it sound like it was only yesterday, even though it's been over eightyears. It's weird because I can still remember Clifton Park perfectly. What's wrong with me?)      Anyway, getting back on topic, the fireworks were mediocre at best. Big surprise there. I actually was more entertained by the form of the smoke as the wind blew it inland. The one time I didn't have my phone, dammit.      Oh, and has everybody seen the Bush/Kerry animation clip at  urlLink jibjab.com  ? I heard about it on the news, and went to go watch it. I found it to be quite funny. I mean, I personally strongly dislike both of them and have no draw to politics whatsoever, but I thought the two candidates pulling each other apart to be pretty humorous. If you haven't seen it, i suggest you check it out.      I just remembered: Tomorrow is my friend'spool party. I'm excited. Hope to see you all there! ;^p    (I'm sorry my entries are so random.)   So yeah, I really can't think of anything to write about right now. My parents have  Top Gun  on TV in the room over the garage, and they just played the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost that lovin' Feelin'" so now I'm finding myself paying less and less attention to my typing and more and more to the song that is now continuing in my head. Curse this musicality of mine!      I bid you all adieu. *hugs*
