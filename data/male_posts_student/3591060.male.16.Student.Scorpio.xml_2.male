It is being designed to provide the foundation for a new industry wave of innovationâ€”ultimately enabling businesses to use technology more effectively, with far fewer barriers, while enabling customers to better realize the full benefits of technology.  Microsoft Windows XP is the first step towards the realization of a new model of computing, one designed around end-to-end experiences that improve the productivity and decision-making abilities of organizations while informing and entertaining customers at home. "Longhorn" will be the next step in this new wave as personal computing becomes a powerful asset in the everyday lives of millions of people worldwide.
