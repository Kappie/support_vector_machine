To explain it briefly, i am trying to sell my  xbox  shrine on the net in order to buy a complete set of Dungeon Master books for  Dungeon And Dragon  play. The books for the latest edition are quite expensive. All informations regarding my Xbox sale can be found on the following Url.   Xbox Set Over Ebay(525$)   ( http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem=8110308575 )   Also, played a bit more of  Evilution's Doom II mod . Awesome! Read a lot of stuff about some upcoming events regarding the end of the world as we know it. I'm a bit skeptical, but i leave room for possibilities. We will all know soon enough. I am going to the dentist tommorow...  Regards,  Zephyr
