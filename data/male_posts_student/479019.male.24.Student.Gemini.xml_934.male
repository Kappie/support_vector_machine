Many people (such as the economist I mentioned) argue that there was an economic boomlead by Reaganthat created many new jobs, despite the outsourcing. If you look at the numbers, they are right. However, a problem is the difference between the types of jobs outsourced and created. Many industrial jobs with strong ties to unions were outsourced for cheaper labor in other countries. The new jobs created were in a completely different field, as the United States more or less transitioned from an industrial economy to  postindustrial  / information economy. The jobs created required different skills, workers, and facilities than what the old industrial towns and workers had to offer. This resulted in these places to begin falling apart, and the workers were now unemployed.   I get pissed off when people say that these unemployed people should just get job. What about the job market? What jobs are there exactly for these people to get bessides McDonalds? How will these people  get paid ?     Dork_for_sale  suggested, the government should fill in the gap and help these people get trained for better jobs. I completely agree with that. However, I feelthat education in general is the key. Maybe it's my bias as an educator, but I think that fixing crappy schools is the first step to solve these problems in the long term...
