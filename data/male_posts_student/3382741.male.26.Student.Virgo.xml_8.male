We have 3 pastors -- my grandfather is one, my uncle is another, and the third happens to be my uncle once removed.  I am directly related to almost half of the church.  my mom, brothers, sister, cousins, aunts, and uncles all go here ... and we have all gone here prety much as long as i have been alive.  i was baptised and became a member at about age 6 and have been fairly active in the church off and on since then.  i am current one of the song leaders and have been in the choir for years as well as helping direct the choir.  most of my life has revolved around the church and the people in the church.  until after i graduated from highschool almost ALL of my friends were from church.  leaving this church is leaving the single biggest influence in my life.  but i think i need to.  i am very afraid of how my family will react.  i am dreading the talks they will inevitably want to have ... the nagging i know i won't be able to avoid.  all in all there is no wasy way out of this.  some have said that i should just leave without saying anything .. but i feel that i owe these people more.  they believe they are doing the right thing and i cannot be mad or upset or critical of them for thier belief.  work was maddning (sp?) today.  simply crazy.  too much going on.  i got off at 8 .. i got home a lil after 9 .. and they want me back at like 7 in the morning.  this means i have to get up at 5 .. which means for 8 hours of sleep i need to go to bed at 9 (oops too late).  wow there is no time left.  i am also starving becuase i have no money to afford food right now.  life is great [i am sure the no money thing is contributing to the depression].  anyway i am going to try to sleep ... wish me luck   PS - if you are wondering about the title .. its about what i am feeling just now ....
