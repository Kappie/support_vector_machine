One day in journalism class as I sat by myself at a table next to a group of upperclassmen, One of them asked, "Hey slick! Where ya from?" That person was Xavier Diez. I answered Detroit. DJ Gleising went on to say, "Oh, it's D from the D!" Xavier said, "No, DD! Tony Awrey then did something that would change my life forever: He said, "No, let's call him Slick-D."  Some sophmores began calling me Slick-D and eventually someone called me it in front of my Honors Algebra class (when I was still in it) and the freshmen class began calling me Slick-D. Variations to shape through various people including Zac's SlickDizzle and DJ's (who continues to be the only one to call me it) Dirty-D, but Slick-D Remains the most popular and my claim to fame. So thanks Tony, I owe you my name.
