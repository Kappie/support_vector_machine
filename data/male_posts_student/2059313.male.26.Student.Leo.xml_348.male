Lisa Moss, the head of the lighting team, came up to the booth after the first service this morning and told me that I did an excellent job and that I did some really neat things for the service and during the songs.  She praised me pretty highly, and I must say that I was extremely pleased with the end product.  I was able to fix a couple things this morning before the services and it made life so much easier.  I had a great day, except that one person who I really would've like to have been there... wasn't.     I understand that I'm not the center of this person's world, and understand that they have a life, though... and I'm not mad, and my day wasn't ruined.  It just would've been nicer for that person to have been there.
