I had a really weird surreal dream that i was messing with my eye(maybe i had an itch or something) and it fell out, and it was really bloody and blood was pouring out of eye. So I was in so much pain I wasn't thinking right, so I kind of jumped onto the floor and tried to pop it back in. I then had like these "dream ripples" throughout the day, where eyes kept coming up in conversations, and all this weird stuff.  a)Sandman has some eye motifs at parts, which I happened to be reading today. b)Midsummer has eyes as a very major theme, if you look for it. c)My sister was telling a friend a lie about how when she was little she punched me and caused my eye to fall out. d)Lastly, some asshole on AIM made a rude remark involving poking me in the eye. Bitch.  I can't direct "Ground Zero", but I'm still directing something. Meh.  I have fallen in love with Xenogears again. Big robots, deep 8-dimensional characters, deep plot involving said robots and characters, plus a healthy(actually, far beyond healthy) does of religion and you get....one of the worst "games" ever made. But hey, it's a 70 hour game, and most of it is plot anyways, so I like to think of it as semi-interactive Evangelion, with no Japanese voice-overs or Kaworu :(  Sandman is gay. They form a rainbow when you own them all. Tehehe.  Jenny's sister Tina is coming home on the 19th, which is a Thursday. I think we're still in school, which means Jenny is going to try to convince her to come and visit all of us little people.(Hehe, it's funny cause she's a lot older than any of us, but she's really short, hehehe). Which will rock. I want to have her abortion.   Wow, that eye dream certainly made a longterm effect on me. Hmm. More nerdiness, blah blah blah. I never got to direct anything, and Sandman has been upgraded to being very very gay, not just gay.
