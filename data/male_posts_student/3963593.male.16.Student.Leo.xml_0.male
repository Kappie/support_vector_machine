We got to the park at 10:00, when the park opened and hit the rides. Because it was Tuesday it wasn't too bad of a crowd so the longest wait was about twenty minutes. The only problem I had was that I was almost too TALL for some of the rides. Now I've heard of people being too fat, but too tall? Well the first ride, Superman Krypton Coaster, the shoulder harness hit my shoulders so early, it was hard to buckle the safety strap, and when I got it buckled, it was cutting into my shoulders. Then the Poltergeist the lap restraint hit my lower thighs instead of lap, so they had to have like two people pushing down on it forcing it down on my legs so they could buckle the safety strap. The Rattler was similar, the lap bars weren't too comfy, but it worked. The best part of the trip was when we rode the family slide like four or five times in a row. We kicked ass on that ride. On all of the banks the tube would go all the way up the wall, and then some, it was awesome. I finished off the day with the last run of the Rattler for the day, and I got me a Jon Deere shirt, I think I'm country/redneck enough to wear it. We got home late, and I got in trouble because I never answered my phone when my parents called, because I couldn't hear it. discipline aside, I had a great time, and it was a great adventure to have one of these outings with just a group of friends, everyone would do it sometime.
