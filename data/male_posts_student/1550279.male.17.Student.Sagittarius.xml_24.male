While it's probably not going to be a movie that I watch as often as some of my others ( Galaxyquest ,  The Mummy (Returns) , etc.), this has to have been one of the best non-action and saddest movies that I've seen in a very long time. If you haven't seen it (and you can manage to sit through something where stuff doesn't blow up every 5 seconds) definitely go out and rent it.  CPL starts today, so expect my post tomorrow to deal with my experiences that I have there.
