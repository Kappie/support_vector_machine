We mostly watched movies.  Some of the titles include:  Once upon a time in Mexico, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, The Nutty Professor, Bruce Almighty, Billy Madison, Happy Gillmore, Meet the Parents, The Last Samurai, and 2 Fast 2 Furious.  We also went to see The day after tomorrow. All good movies.  We also swam a lot in my friends pool.  It was great, because a lot of the day was hot.     But it wasn't all fun times.  On the second day, we were outside playing hockey (also watching Gr. 12 graduates across the street.  Some of the dresses were nice ~_^) and i tripped and fell, to scrape my knee badly. At first, it was nothing, i didn't even notice it was bleeding down my leg.  I fell, then got back up and ran after the ball.  No big deal, then.  I checked it a little while later, and found that it had successfully soaked the knee of my shorts in blood.  So, i went in the house, and cleaned it off, got a bandaid and some cream, and it felt better for a while.    The day after, it got really stiff.  As it is now, i can hardly bend it without some pain.  It feels as if all the skin on the whole leg has been pulled tight, and whenever i try to bend it, it feels as if the knee is going to pop out of the skin.   On a better note, this morning, i found 'Beyond Good  Evil' at Walmart for an expensive price of $14.98.  I just couldn't resist, and everying i've heard about that game was good, so i bought it.  And the reviews were right, it's an amazing game!  I especially like the music.  Sort of a celtic vibe to it... reminds me of Ireland.  ^_^  Anyways, that was my party experience.  Not the wildest of times, but we had fun.  Oh ya, we also watched lots of Jerry Springer and Maury.  It's really fun making fun of the people who come on those shows.  Lates
