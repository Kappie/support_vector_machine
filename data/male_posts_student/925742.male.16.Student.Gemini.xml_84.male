After a year of being in and out of the hospital for therapy, he seemed really well.  But recently he fell again, and was too weak to recover.    He was a somewhat slow person, both physically and mentally in his later life.  He was a very tall man and played basketball in his day.  I remember seeing a photo ad he towered over everyone else.  He was a god talker and listener.  Goodbye, Handsome John.
