Bloody Hands,  But a clean mind, So many answers, It’s now the question you can’t find, Is it now the inverse? You die before you live, And you’re punished before you lie, You often find the answer, Even before you can think to ask why. You start with a shine and end with a glow, You clap or hiss, Before the start of the show, Sorted Confusion,
