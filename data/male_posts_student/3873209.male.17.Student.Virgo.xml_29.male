I won't get into the icky details-but it's like they live to annoy the hell out of each other, without caring what happens to me and my sister. Well, they do care about me and my sister, but often you wouldn't think that. What should I do? I could probably shut them up by telling them to grow up and behave like adults, but then they'll continue arguing some other time and I'm too tired at the moment anyway... sometimes (like now)I wish could kick them out of the house by calling the police due to them being a domestic disturbance but hey... it might help like when I called them and my sister left for a few weeks... but then they own this place hmmm...  yeah I know this is a very pessimistic post but hey that's what happens around here on an almost daily basis... Could you people please pray for my family (if that's not being selfish)? It seems to be getting worse and worse each week. Well, one good thing has happened though-my sister has started coming to church again! :D even though it's a different church to where the rest of us go to (Epping Baptist) but still. I suppose things could be worse (like my parents being dead)-oh yeah so could you people pray for Eddie's family? His mother died this morning from cancer so it'd be nice if you could pray for them in their grief.  Mmmm they're still at it-really quite hard to study-I think I'd better go and *try* to do some work...   Psalm 42   As the deer pants for streams of water,  so my soul pants for you, O God.  2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.  When can I go and meet with God?  3 My tears have been my food  day and night,  while men say to me all day long,  "Where is your God?"  4 These things I remember  as I pour out my soul:  how I used to go with the multitude,  leading the procession to the house of God,  with shouts of joy and thanksgiving  among the festive throng.   5 Why are you downcast, O my soul?  Why so disturbed within me?  Put your hope in God,  for I will yet praise him,  my Savior and 6 my God.   My [3] soul is downcast within me;  therefore I will remember you  from the land of the Jordan,  the heights of Hermon-from Mount Mizar.  7 Deep calls to deep  in the roar of your waterfalls;  all your waves and breakers  have swept over me.   8 By day the LORD directs his love,  at night his song is with me-  a prayer to the God of my life.   9 I say to God my Rock,  "Why have you forgotten me?  Why must I go about mourning,  oppressed by the enemy?"  10 My bones suffer mortal agony  as my foes taunt me,  saying to me all day long,  "Where is your God?"   11 Why are you downcast, O my soul?  Why so disturbed within me?  Put your hope in God,  for I will yet praise him,  my Savior and my God.
