I don't think it's a bad thing, but then again, I don't know what   it  is.   I want .... Whoa, I forgot what I was gonna say. That's what I get for lettin myself get distracted by TV. Bluh, if it's important or significant I guess it'll come back to me.   I have no homework for today, besides outlining. This rocks!  I   need   CD's.... I've been compiling songs to put into it. I jus derno what to put into it. I'm also trying to figure out if there's some kind of theme that goes along w/ them. They seem a bit ...uh .. non-similar.   I've been thinkin, using song lyrics as posts is a bit annoying to me. However, I understand, as well I hope others do, that (at least when   I   do it) it's done for personal reasons, not for the enjoyment for others. So, in that spirit, here's some stuff from Dashboard Confessional...    Dashboard Confessional   - Living In Your Letters  "...There is no need to test my heart, with useless space. These roads go on forever And there will always be a place  For you in my heart  So I'll hit the pavement  it's gotta be better than waiting  pushing you far away cause I'm scared. So I'll take my chances  head on my way up there. Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten."  I'm out ppl. L8.
