Ever since I've moved here things have been up and down. My biggest complaint is the people. You can't trust anybody here. Everybody is planning to screw you.   Last night I got called from Mike Affarano. Mike's pretty cool. Anyways, he called me last night and told me he was at Mike Neubauer's. See above about trust. Mike Neubauer and I were never, I dunno, friendly. He seems to be pissed off at everybody because it's the cool thing to do. So, I figured Mike was on speaker. The conversation went something like this:  Mike (A): Hey, Neubauer wants to ask you something about Mandy. Me: Ehh, I dunno. Mike (N): Hey, dude. I don't even know you Me: I know you. You went out with Sara, right? Mike (N): Yeah. (pause) Wait. Are you tall with glasses? Me: Yeah. Mike (N): Oh yeah, you said "Hi" to Sara once in the lunchline. Did you flirt with her? Me: Oh yeah dude, that's it. I flirted with your girlfriend. Mike (N): No, did you? Me: No, dude. So, you like Mandy? Mike (N): I dunno. Me: Well, I can't really tell you anything if you don't tell me. Mike (N): Yeah, I do. Do you think she'd cheat on me? Me:  This is where I screwed up  I dunno. She's always around a lot of guys, and she's not the most trusting person. Mike (N): Yeah, well if she does something with another guy I'll fight him. I put the last guy I fought into the hospital. If you hear anything you'll tell me, right? Dan: I dunno. Mandy's a friend. I just can't go blabbing her information to everyone. Mike (N): Come on dude, I know Mike'll tell me. Dan: I can't promise. Mike (N): Ok, See ya dude. Mike (A): OK. You're off speaker. You were on speaker this whole time. Me: ok. Anyways, See ya dude. Mike (A): See ya. *click*  So, this morning I get a call from Mandy. She asks why I told MIke Neubauer she'd cheat on him. I said, that I said, she wasn't so trusting. She didn't seem too mad and said she had to go. This is when I got mad at Mike Affarano because if Neubauer really liked Mandy he wouldn't tell her he called me to find out about her. ^Agree with the last line? Comment about it.  I took a shower right after, and then called Mandy back and apologized. I said I was sorry for talking about her behind her back. She said it was fine and not to worry about it.  So today I call Jason and we decide to head over to Mike (A)'s house. On our way there we see Mandy, Mike, Mike, a 12-year-old girl, a like 10-year-old boy, and her two little sisters. We say say hi, and Jason and I watch for awhile. I didn't talk to Mike (A), and Mike (A) didn't talk to me.  So time passes, and Mike (N) tries to intimidate me with questions like "Have you ever got into a fight?" and "Why are you here?" I answered both calmly, and I acted like I didn't know what was happening. Just like he was trying to make small-talk.  Here comes the climax of the situation: the 12-year-old girl, who I think I caught her name is 'Bitch' decides to tell me to go home, and also decides she's going to throw blocks of ice at me. I don't know what to do. She's 12 and I'm 15. Finally I threw a piece back, but over her head as a warning. She doesn't stop. Then her brother tells me to go to. So, because Jason is still there, and nobody really cared about me being there except for the siblings and Neubauer, I said that I wouldn't leave until Mandy told me to leave.  All Mandy said was "Well, I want Jason to stay..." I said ok, and walked toawrds my house. Mike (A) followed me, and I told him that I'd like for all 7 of them over there to go fuck themselves excluding Jason.  So... I've been home since then.
