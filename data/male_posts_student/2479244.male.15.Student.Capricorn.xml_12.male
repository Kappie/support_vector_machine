Last night I lay awake wondering something that I had never thought before: Would it be possible, at some time in the future, to replicate a human brain? That is not to say to program a machine to respond to basic commands, but to make a replica of a logically thinking brain. One that can deduct reasoning from situations, one that can learn, one that can function independently of its creators. But furthermore, I do not mean to clone a brain and implant it into someone. I mean to build some kind of entity that is capable of learning capacity and logic.  I know for a fact that at the stage of technology our world is at right now, it is absolutely impossible to do something of this calibur. This kind of replication technology is hundreds, possibly thousands of years ahead of us, and I will never see something like this in the few years I will spend on this blue planet. However, I feel that many things could happen that could broaden the spectrum of possbility -- call me looney if you want to, but take the automobile for example. It was seen as a ridiculous concept that was so farfetched it could never happen. Who is to say that an artificial, independent brain could not at some point be created?  Now, the only thing I see wrong with it is this: if a person is to create something, regardless of how they try, their personality will in one way or another shine through. That is to say, you cannot make a completely untainted object, a blank "brain," in which it has never been stimulated by some kind of outside knowledge. Take for example your computer. This may not immediately jump to your mind, but a computer has been built to only be stimulated by certain things. Things that you want it to be stimulated by. It will not be stimulated by people talking, visuals, sound, feeling... only by a simple input of data. Herein is where the problem lies - how could you create an object in which you do not put a basic medium of attainable data? That is to say, there is no definate object that the "brain" would learn from, only knowledge in basic.   The human brain is a strange object. It is split up into sectors - each one holds different "types" of knowledge, yet this is a concept fabricated by our minds. Is there really short-term memory, or is it all long-term? Vice versa? Who am I to say? The biggest problem in creation would be identifying the different types of knowledge for each sector. All knowledge is not taken in the same way. Your brain is split between visual / tangible stimulation and abstract / audio stimulation. How would it be possible to make something that could distinguish between different types without teaching it in the first place? There are so many "what if's" for something like this.  However, I am adamant that something like this is not impossible in the future. It could very well be possible that you could make some sort of memory holding object that would take in its own data, analyze it by itself, conclude its own logic, etc. I cannot make as many possibility comments on something that is so far ahead of our time as I can impossibility comments. I would just suggest to keep an open mind.  The one thing that would amaze me with a creation like this would be the ability for it to make its  own  creations. Could you imagine if you could simply build a human replica that could build itself by simply reading directions that it had never seen before? Could you imagine if you could actually teach a machine, one that would grow and learn and develop an opinion? Could you imagine the possibilities? It could be a utopia or it could be the destruction of humankind as we know it. Its all such a clich√©, but it is all so interesting.  Perhaps you could build your memories and your life into a machine like this before you die. It could be eternal life; eternal hell.  I could babble about this for hours, but I'm going to let you use your own gift of thinking on the subject.
