Shallow:: I'm afraid of water  Erotica:: I don't even want to hear it anymore  Figment:: Have you ever heard of the color qwijybo? Or maybe it's just a pigment of my imagination!  Eviction:: I've never been evicted!  Composed:: De-  Chill:: -in  Girl:: Email is awesome and email is weird, email is awesome and email is weird and I'll never forget what we had grrrrrl!  California:: That's where I live!  Bond:: Shaken, not stirred    My friend Sasha had a graduation party and I went to it because I had nothing better to do...just kidding! It's cause I love her! Dominique went and we gave both Sasha and Sarah (her twin) cards from Dominique and I (I still can't believe that Dominique signed it "Dom" she hates that!) Dominique made me lick the envelopes! She's such a princess! (A beautiful, sweet, kind, cute and awesome one at that!) Hmm...that could be a problem.   "Sultan: Rules are rules and the rules say Both: You must be married to a prince." --Aladdin  Darn, there go my hopes and dreams. I can't marry Dominique, I'm not a prince! Oh well...maybe she'll marry me anyways!  Anyways, the party was a lot of fun...We (Dominique, Samantha and I) watched most of Blue Streak, but we had to go before then. It was funny, but they cussed  a lot  in it. Dominique and her mom and my mom and I are all going out to lunch on Tuesday! I can't wait, I can't wait! I'm bored, I think I am going to go play chess. Have a great day everybody; comment comment comment!  "B.E.N.: ...I'm beginning to see my life pass before my eyes... at least, I think it's my life... WAS I EVER DANCING WITH AN ANDROID NAMED LUPE?" --Treasure Planet  P.S. if you have ever wondered where I get these quotes, I registered at  urlLink http://www.imdb.com  and added all of the movies that Dominique and I have seen into this. That's the movies that I use for quotes. Treasure planet wasn't a very good movie..although, I wasn't paying much attention to it (Melody! Don't hurt me! I was a good boy, honest! :-P)  P.P.S. I have a new friend, his name is Judah! ~0(0~ .U ^Psst...that's him!
