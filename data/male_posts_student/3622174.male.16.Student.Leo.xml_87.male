Just as long as it isn't cold when I'm soaking wet at Islands of Adventure. It would be so awesome... normally its about 100 degrees out here, and today's high wasn't anywhere near 80, even. That's awesome...KEEP IT THAT WAY, PLEEEASE!   I'm all packed to go to Camp Orlando. Took a couple suitcases to get it right, but, now I'm all packed into one thing. And its HEAAAVY! But, I guess that since I'm partially packed for my trip to the New York state afterwards, it fits the scene.   Just wanna welcome my good ol' buddy Alex to the Blogger world... he just signed up today. Just look through my profile, click on The River, and you'll see it. Now if only I could get Adam to sign up for Blogger and ditch his other journal (I'll show you how to move your old blog over here, if you do Adam!), and other people too, then The River's Blog Community will get even bigger...and it all started with me. Who knows, maybe the majority of The River High School's population will get on Blogger by the end of the next school year...that would be awesome.  Anywho. I can't wait to get out of here tomorrow. Look for audio posts throughout the week, because its the only way that I will be able to blog. Then, when I come back, I'll edit them all, giving them titles, text, etc., to along with it. And, when I come back, I'll have pictures and stuff from the trip, as well. Tonight at 9:30, join me for my special "Not so late night but late enough because I'm going to Camp OrlandoÂ® Tomorrow and have to get up at 5:30 in the morning Bloggin'" post. See ya then!
