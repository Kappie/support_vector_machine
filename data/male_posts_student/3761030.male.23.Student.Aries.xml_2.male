I see the initial release would be a simple private file system, meaning only I could view the files.  A new option under the "label" task panewould be a "folder" task pane which would actually be my folder system.  Ideally, I could have subfolders, but I am not being picky initially.  The requirement would be that I could easily upload files, give them short descriptions, delete them.  An extra benefit would be that I could apply keywords for searching purposes.  Potential extras:  (1) I could "label" my files with the same gMail labels, so that while they were in the folder structure I could apply a "label" if it was related to a certain body of emails.  Then when I click on the label view to see my emails I would see a link to my file.  (2) I could assign permissions on a per folder basis so that other users would see my files, they would be  "networked" folders  and appear on their gmail account in the folder taskpane.  Talk about incredible communication options!  (3) Along the lines of my GoogleGroups2 integration, I would like to see in the folder taskpane perhaps a folder for each group I am a member of.  The idea would be that the groups would have a central file system that all users could access from this system.  It would be similar to option (2) but automatic for all members in your group.   As a side note I have a "hacked" setup currently that gets the basic job done.   I created a new label called " Files".  Its important to have the space, doing so puts it at the top of my labels.  I then created a filter that said if it was from my gmail account and to my gmail account and contained an attachment that it would bypass the inbox and apply the label " Files".  To upload files I send myself the file, I put in the subject a short description/filename, in the body I can optionally put keywords (for searching), and then I just attach the file and send it.  It automatically gets filed.  Not perfect but gets the "basic" job done.
