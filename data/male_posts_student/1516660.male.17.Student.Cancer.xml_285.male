I went there to eat mian fen guo, while Mother ate nasi something, forgot le la. Heh. After that, we brought 8 Days and I was reading while Mother went to Shop N Save.   HaHaHa! That mother go and chat with Yvonne Phua, and made Yvonne key in 61 quantity of some veggie. HAHAHA! The customer looked so shocked when $60+ came up in the register and Yvonne said "You la! Come and talk to me! I must go find Pek Chu!" and laughed. We laughed too. HAHA! Hmm...Mother walked around to check price while I was walking around and reading. At the end, Lao Ma Zi tried to make Mother buy coffee for her. HaHa. My mother refused. Meow meow meow! We returned home at 10.  Hmm. I went online, chatted with Professor Snapeluva, and went on MNI. I am getting so pek chek at the slow loading times. I found out that it was due to IE's functions. I am now thinking of upgrading to Mozilla Firefox. WQ said I should (Oh my my! Savage Garden's Truly Madly Deeply is playing on the radio?! I love the song!!). Hmm. Maybe I'll do it. See first. After chatting and fustrated refreshing, I went to play FFX.  Hmm. I played FFX until 3, when I went down to play bball with my friends,. I met Janet first and we saw KentKent at the court. Gloria and HL came soon after, followed by Chin Quan. Hmm...we played and played. We took a short break, I went up to fill CQ's water bottle and I took my water bottle down. Hmm...when I came down, some ducks occupied our court. So we let them play for awhile. We sat down and chatted. Janet's brother joined us and when the court's clear, we played lor. Play play play till 5.50+, when I have a huge stomachache and had to rush back home.  Meow meow. After clearing my bowels, I bathed and had to eat dinner. Meow moo meow! After that, I came online.  How meowful. Tomorrow we are going to visit my paternal grandmother, who had her leg amputated. It seems like it died or something. Yeah. After that, I am going to Pasir Ris beach to play with my friends. I think i will fully update you tomorrow, if I have the chance to come online, that is.   Well, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
