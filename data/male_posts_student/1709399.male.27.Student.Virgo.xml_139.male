I have to thank my friend Sudri (Sudarshan) who introduced me into the world of Blogs. When I started I had no idea what to write but now on retrospection , I feel I haven't done a bad job. There is still tremedous scope of improvement and a wide range of topics on which I would like to write. Thanks to all of you for your support .
