The two consoles are going to launch separately, the DS on November 11, 2004, and the PSP, sometime in 2005. The new systems seem to both be awesome machines, and now, we are here to compare the two, here on Digital Lust, for a sneak preview of the new fall format for the blog.      Sony PSP   When Sony first announced their new PSP at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2003, gamers were puzzled as to what it would do; what kind of graphics it would be able to handle, how much it would cost, will it break easily like other Playstation products, things of that matter. Nothing was revealed about the new console with the exception that it was in development. Then, in late 2003, a concept image of the console revealed it to have almost PS2-quality graphics, along with an optical disc drive, and a sweet widescreen format that takes up most of the console, something that Gameboy owners have been dying to have since the Gameboy Advance first came out. No specs or anything were revealed.     At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2004, Sony unleashed the PSP. Special features include the ability to watch flicks on the console (Spiderman 2! Spiderman 2! Spiderman 2!), play games with almost PS2-quality graphics, play MP3 files, and it would also feature connectivity with the Playstation 2, similar to what Nintendo's Gameboy Advance can do with the Nintendo GameCube. Although nothing was playable at the trade show, according to various sources around the internet, several Playstation Portable units were being displayed at the show, to show off what they can do. Games like Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, and others are to be expected from the system (Gran Turismo is already confirmed!).     The only things we have to be worried about with the PSP are its price, its battery life, and its ability to survive being dropped. With all of these sweet features that Sony is promising with the PSP, you can expect a much higher price out of this thing. With the optical disc drive, you have to worry about the battery life of the console, and if it will only last a few hours. And, also with the drive, will it break easily like most optical drives do? Will Sony repair it if it does, or will you have to fork out $200 to get it fixed? Sony has not answered any of these questions yet, and don't intend to, at least until they show the thing off next. These are the major concerns among people who are interested in getting a new handheld device. Sony doesn't have the best track record for customer service, and replacing broken consoles since they break easily.     Nintendo DS         Nintendo announced in 2003 that they had something "huge" coming in 2004, but wouldn't tell us whether it was a new console, a handheld, or another Mario game where the "huge" comes in at Mario being able to shoot fire through a fire cannon. But, it turned out to be a handheld when they announced it in 2004. The Nintendo "DS" stands for "Dual screen," but also for "Developer's System." That is because the system features two 3 inch, color, backlit screens, giving developers new ways to develop creative games. Nothing else was said about the system, other than the fact that both screens could be used together to form one giant, six inch screen, and they also said that the screens would "stack," meaning one would be on top of the other.     At the Electronics Entertainment Expo in 2004, Nintendo revealed the Nintendo DS in playable form, and...it's ugly. Nintendo mentioned that it was only a prototype, and that the final design had not been confirmed yet, but, this thing was ugly, and better not be a taste of what's to come. For having N64 quality graphics, it should at least have an analog stick. This does not. It's got four directional buttons, four action buttons, and L and R buttons, and that's it. The system looks really lame.    Some of the cool features of the Nintendo DS include voice recognition technology, adding a new level of play to your game. They also have touch screen on the bottom screen, allowing you to "draw" your Pac Man for the new Pac Man game, send instant messages, and control your character. This is a pretty cool features, but you'd have to be careful with your stylus to avoid damaging the screen.    Most of the games that Nintendo showed off for the Nintendo DS were very, very lame. Super Mario 64x4 is simply a multiplayer port of Super Mario 64, and the graphics look really choppy and bad. Metroid Prime: Hunters looks alright, but, too much of the same from the GameCube game.     Overall, I think Nintendo needs to do some research and work before this thing can be dubbed the "Virtual Boy of the 21st Century." The system is really ugly, and I don't like the games, but, it has the potential. Nintendo just needs to get crackin' if they want to have a good system out by its November 11th release.  ----------------------    So, which console is better? It's too early to tell which one is definitely the better one, but now, I'm leaning towards the Sony PSP. I'm not a huge fan of Sony products, but, Nintendo is not doing a very good job of getting the point across with this whole Nintendo DS business. The name hasn't even been confirmed yet, and they want to launch it in November. As soon as Sony gives me new details on the PSP, I'm sold.    Join me later on today for something on the Tech side of Digital Lust, in today's preview of the fall formatting. Remember, we are doing only two posts a day from now on, something from the gaming world, and something from the tech world. And it all varies. So, you have to be here to check it out!
