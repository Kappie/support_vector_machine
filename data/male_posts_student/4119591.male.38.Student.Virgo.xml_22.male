Crandall was boldly approached by another iPod user, a 30ish woman bopping enthusiastically to some high-energy tune.  "She walked right up to me and got within my comfort field," Crandall stammered. "I was taken aback. She pulled out the earbuds on her iPod and indicated the jack with her eyes."  This is, of course, pretty silly. However the wireless sharing idea sounds cool. It wouldn't have to be limited to iPods. More excerpt:   Sharing an iPod through its headphone jack is also a crude, low-tech version of what some predict is the real killer application of future iPods: transforming them into short-distance broadcasting devices by adding Bluetooth or similar radio technology, coupled with Rendezvous, an Apple-developed networking technology that allows devices to discover each other automatically. ... "It would greatly annoy the RIAA, which would argue that it's a portable Napster," he wrote in 2002. "But ... this music-sharing appliance could have fairly dramatic social effects.... You could get promiscuous with strangers: You could pair and exchange a song on the same short bus ride. You could create short, ad hoc personal broadcasts, to anyone else with a Bluetooth iPod. You could have a 'What am I listening to?' menu option and share your choice with anyone within discoverable range."  Don't mind me... Soon I'll be bopping within my comfort field with promiscuous strangers.
