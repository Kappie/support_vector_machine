We went and got some Cuervo from the drug store and some margarita mix from Williams-Sonoma tonight.  Good stuff.  Will have to partake more tomorrow night.  I seem to be writing in short, incomplete sentences tonight.  If there is an explanation for this, it's beyond me.  I am very tired though, but I'm always tired this time at night.  I guess getting up at 6 or 6:30 every morning will do that to you.   My knee has been hurting worse each day for the last few days.  Today it progressed to the point that I had to limp through most of our evening walk.  I'm no doctor, but I don't think that's a good sign.  Hopefully if I do nothing different, keep walking a couple miles on it every night, and proceed with life as usual it will get better on its own.  If not, school starts in a week and a half and then I can go see a doctor for free again.  Won't that be nice.  What a crappy blog.  I should be posting my thoughts on life, the universe, or even everything.  Alas, maybe later.
