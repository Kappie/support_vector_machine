Just tiring as hell.  Its interesting, as I'm continuing to become more and more of my own person, how I find friends in unexpected places and loose them slowly with unexpected friends... it seems to happen to everyone, it just sucks though.  I just need to get out with a bunch of people and have a fun time sometime.. or something.. I haven't done that for a while.   Saw i,Robot today with Nick.. that was a good movie.  I've been like best friends with him since kindergarten, then today he was saying some stuff that kinda pissed me off.. I can't remember the last time he made me feel angry..  I dunno.  We just don't seem to have as much in common as we used to.  Anyways, thats all for now.  I'm tired and fed up with people.
