Oh well, Canucks in 5 haha.  Yeah even though it is monday morning, I will consider this a Sunday blog, (I was away from the computer, watching the game today!)  Work was alright, they started me on fry right away, even though im supposed to be on salad, I think I managed pretty well for my first day working.  When I have my first full shift, that will be interesting, damn I hope all the waitresses aren't 19, I don't think I would fair to well if they were all that age.  Well not much else to say right now, I'm going to bed.
