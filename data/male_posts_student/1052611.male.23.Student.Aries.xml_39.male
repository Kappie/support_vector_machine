In fact, rains are quite nice; but that is mostly when you are sitting by the window in the warmth of your house, with a good book to read. What I don’t fancy, is the idea of getting stuck, after 3 hours of grueling tuitions in the middle of a busy road when the auto driver asks my friend and me to please get out since he couldn’t possibly go any further. We spent the next 20 minutes walking in knee deep ‘water’ (God knows what else we must have stepped in). The market that we were walking in was definitely amazing. And the jerks that were standing outside shops jeering at all the vehicles that got stuck in the slush and laughing their what not off at poor, troubled people like my friend and me were even more amazing. But some of the people were really concerned. There were people who were actually standing outside their houses to warn pedestrians so that they wouldn’t fall in the drain. I then had to call my dad up to come and pick us up. We had to wait for another hour IN THE RAIN till my dad arrived like a saint who performed kind acts for those who weren’t too privileged or whatever. Anyway I reckon it is going to be pretty wet and ‘ichak pichak’ for a while. So everyone might as well get used to it.
