The Dickies, Adicts, and Agent Orange are playing tomorrow in Long Beach. It would be cool if I could go. I get my schedule for next week today.  Work today from 5 PM - 12 AM.  I find it fascinating how many people come to me for advice or to vent. It's even more interesting that many women come to me for guy advice.  ***
