I've been playing for ages and I find it really fun, it has a cool community, and a fair share of utter loosers, one of which screwed me out of a nice new sword I wanted to buy...   However, that is besides the point, and boring for anyone (most of you) who will have no clue what the hell I am on about. At the home front, parents have errected a water feature in the garden, which looks nice surrounded by lots of brown soil - England is soo good at the dreary colours such as brown, its untrue! - and not much else, but I'm sure a lot of pretty flowers will apear there soon... or maybe not.. depends on what Jane - Sam's mum - decides to do in the space.        Tomorrow I am serving at church... yay my weekly dosage of church going, singing and rejoicing in a religous fashion... I however cannot be arsed to get up, God surely can understand my prayers when I'm asleep... right?    Ahh anyway, so thats tomorrow...   On a side note, I am extremely hungry... I've not eaten anything other than a piece or two of cheese and a bacon sandwich... hopefully food is upcoming.   Too hungry to write more, catch me on MSN.   Dxx
