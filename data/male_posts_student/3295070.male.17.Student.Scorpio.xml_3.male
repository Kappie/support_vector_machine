And then after trying to remember my password for about 20 minutes, it dawned on me! So I logged in, and here I am, posting to all of my hoards of fans.        Hey, wanna hear about my day? well too damn bad, youre gonna hear about it anyways! So today was pretty much like any other day, pretty mundane and bland . . . not a whole lot went on. I went to school as usual, had a "code red" drill,(what a bunch of bull) got pissed off at a couple of my teachers for being so damn ignorant as usual. Although lunch was a little different, a really good friend of mine was fealing kinda down, so i sat with her for most of it, we talked mostly. After lunch I went to my afternoon classes, then got on the bus and went home. When I got home I did some unicycling . . . blah blah blah . . . drove around town . . . blah blah blah . . . and here we are at 8:30! boy does time ever fly when youre gapping out.       So for all you n00bs out there, i'd better tell you a little more about me seeing as how this is only my second post and all . . . im a pretty laid back kinda guy, and I like to take things at a relaxed pace. That relaxed pace sure does get me in a shitload of trouble though, hehehe. Im a pretty big procrastinator, and I havent really had any short, or long term goals in a looooong time, but who needs 'em? im 17, i deserve to be a free willed teenager that does whatever I like . . . or at least i'd like to think so! This is probably really boring for all yous guys, but TOO BAD, cause I cant think of anything else to type about! oh wait . . . im getting something . . .       So prom is coming up this saturday, and seeing as how this is my senior year and all . . . I thought I should go, just for tradition's sake. I'm not really too thrilled about it though, I dont look too good in a suit, I dont dance . . . ever, and its turning out to cost ALOT of money. I'll be glad when it's all over, no more hassle, and hopefully everyone will be in a better mood after getting loaded and fucking each other like wild dogs. Well thats pretty much all thats on my mind right now . . . so I think i'll be off to do the same thing I do every night       -Adios!
