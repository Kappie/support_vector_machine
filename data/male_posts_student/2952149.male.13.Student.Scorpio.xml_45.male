(assuming it was around the 28th) and she asked and they are moving THIS COMING SATURDAY! Dude....total bummer. I was soooo sad and still am. She started crying on the phone and I felt SO bad I wanted to go over there and hold her close. :( Dammit and everytime I would forget about it I would look over at the photos and be like "Oh shit....I forgot about that." Yeah and I was hoping to do something with her next weekend as like a final day together but I guess we can't now. I am going to go in early monday to meet her. WTF some person I don't even know IMed me asking if I wanted to watch her on her webcam. lol thats kinda weird yet funny at the same time.
