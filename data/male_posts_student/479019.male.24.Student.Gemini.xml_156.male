That's almost 7 hours being couped up in an office.  Looks like Verizon cancelled my phone line order, because of some stupid thing where you have to order your phone line within 30 days of the activation date. I also need to get around to canceling my Cingular cell phone, and order a Verizon National Plan. Seeing as how I'll be travelling from coast to coast relatively often, I'll need that.  Tomorrow I'm going to go to MOCA with Julia and Naomi, and then we're going meet up with Janet for dinner. Man! I've spent a lot of money this week. I guess I've been jobbing a lot, but I really need that money for when school starts and to buy a laptop.  Anyway... after listening to the new  Weezer  stuff some more... these are the songs I'm digging... Superstar, Private Message, Untenable and Fontana.  ***
