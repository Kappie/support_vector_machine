I tried legendary and thats just insanely hard to do, but so far I got to the 2nd lvl on that difficulty lvl. I got to the 3rd lvl on Heroic and seems rather easy. Anyways, if anybody else plays Halo on PC, I was wondering if you wanna set-up a multiplayer match online. I play better on XBOX but I am good on PC too. Let me know.
