I realize this will reduce my free time to absolute zero, but at least my bank account won't be there, as well, right?  Right.  So yesterday I scouted airfare to Louisville (yeah, Kentucky Derby!), Belize (yeah, Jason!), and a few other places.  And I had no way of knowing at the time, but after watching the video of Sasha in Kenya helping the Lost Boys, I really want to go there for a while.  Yeah, I know... me.  In Africa.  Weird.  Anyway, it won't happen, I'm sure, but it's a fun thoguht to entertain, no?  Mary's doing well so far in Moscow.  She's met up with a couple friends from the Middlebury program, and they're giving her, I'd imagine, valuable insight into what to do while she's there.  She's living with an older lady, much like our Yia Yia, who loves to feed her at all hours of the day.  Heh.  My friend Katie introduced me to some really great music last night... Joey Eppard.  Really awesome stuff.  I've been listening nonstop.  Check out "Static."  And anything else you find, for that matter.  Went to the Cape this weekend with Nate after the BU show.  Hyannis Sound board meeting was this weekend, so Slick, Rellz, Dave Petrelli, Judd, Rob, Townsend, Bonk, Mikey B, Largay, Dawg, Wrobz, and Fozz were all in attendance at Rob and Damia's house.  Great, great weekend.  Nate and I got there too late to catch Fozz and Largay, but were psyched to find Garvey, Garvin, Becky and Caroline there.  100 days to go.  Tomorrow we hit double digits.  Whaaaaaaaaaat?  Hyannis Sound audition info, FYI:  NYC:  March 15-16.  Contact Townsend Belisle-- townsend@hyannissound.com Boston: March 29-30.  Contact Jim Harrington-- jim@hyannissound.com  Thought I'd throw that out there for posterity.  Hanging out tonight with Bain and someone I apparently worked on a campaign with in 2000.  Should be fun.  I love amnesia... you meet so many great new people.  heh.  Alright... fairly recent additions to the good listenins list:  Joey Eppard Great Big Sea October Project  Enjoy those.  The current reading list:  The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt-- Edmund Morris (I swear I'm gonna win this one) What's So Great About America-- Dinesh D'Souza Bias- Bernard Goldberg Telling the Truth- Lynne Cheney The War Against Boys- Christina Hoff Sommers The 48 Laws of Power- Robert Greene  And various periodicals-- The Economist (for an invaluable global foreign policy and economic view... shattering the myths we've all become accustomed to believing), Reason (Free Minds and Free Markets), National Review, Weekly Standard, Atlantic Monthly, Insight... a few others, but those are the biggies.  Dunno why I put all that in here, but just in case any of you are trying to keep abreast of what I'm reading at the moment, there you go.  Okay... time to shower and go find a job.  Hope you all have great days... and evenings, if I don't talk to you.
