The "View Blog" thing is mucked up 2. When I change the size of the top frame the posting area rezises ONLY when I make it bigger.. not when I make it smaller. 3. It  blows.  I just got back from the slopes. I had a good time but ehg some people realy suck. This kid I was with lost his ski getting on the lift __3__ times.. ok it was my doing the last time but he lost it by himself twice. We ski'ed (acutly he sik'ed and I snowboardededd) untill the end of time time (Hey I paid my money i'll not be screwed).  So y'all see the news about MS Source Code leaked? (Win2k/NT).. yea I got a copy.. ohh I mean I would never get a copy thats so against the law. The only code i'v glanced at is the code for MSHTML. It's quite intresting.  I think im starting to like using this notebook instead of my desktop but it is slower! (Need iBook or PowerBook.. waahhhh), Jeff
