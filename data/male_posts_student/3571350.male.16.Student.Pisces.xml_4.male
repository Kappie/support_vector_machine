Today I watched Ronald Reagan's funeral is was really sad watching it i can just imagine how people close to him or people who were alive or remembered him when he was president. Anywho, my dad is clueless about computer/music but i don't blame him he's hardly on the computer anyways. he was asking if the song i was playing was skipping since i put it on repeat for 13 times since i liked it soo much. My parents did groceries today. Still didn't get my list right but i'll deal with since they got me stuff i like. I hope i sleep well tonight and wake up in time for F1 Canadian grand prix qualifying. I just LOVE Formula1 racing. It's my favourite kind of car racing and I hope rubens barichello can show a good performance this year and knock off michael shumacher who just keeps winning everything in sight. Also track and field is on. The Golden League Oslo track and field is on CBC tomorrow at 5 i hope i don't forget about it. My favourite event is pole vault or 800 metres. I don't know if Perdita is competing in it but I sure hope so. Well as you should've noticed not much else to type and i'm still in a good mood. Bye for tonight :D
