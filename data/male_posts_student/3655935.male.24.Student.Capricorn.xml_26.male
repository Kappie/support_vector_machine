For God simply determines exactly what will take place in accordance with his will.  An omnipotent two-year-old could exercise this kind of providence.  As I understand God’s providence, he is praiseworthy because he wisely works with utterly free creatures who continuously rebel against his will, yet he is still able to accomplish his desired end.  This kind of providence would require vast wisdom (dare I say omniscience) in order to work.  Moreover, this providence demonstrates genuine love and respect for free creatures, rather than forcing them to do whatever he wills like some kind of divine rape.  In the end, this comes out to be a praiseworthy providence.  I am reminded of Paul’s words in Romans 11:33: “Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!”
