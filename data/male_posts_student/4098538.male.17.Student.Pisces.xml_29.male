Nothing out of the ordinairy has happened as of late. Went to the cinema a few days ago to see Starsky and Hutch or whatever it's called... it's pretty good. I got an insect bite on my leg and it is so sore. I think it's infected too! Well Mandy's on her way over so I'm gonna go wait for her in my room. xx
