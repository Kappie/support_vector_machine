However, break is over now..so its back to the books, beer and babes.  Ahh yes..college life. Today is superbowl sunday, and I believe i forgot to give a shit or something.  I used to be big into football. I followed the Dallas Cowboys religiously..and NO I didnt "jump on the bandwagon". I liked them before they started to win their 5,287 championships.  Now I don't really want to waste my younger years away in front of the TV. When i'm old and out of college and working a real job, I can see myself getting back into it all.  Right now i'm too into "living life" and all that to put watching football at the top of my list of priorities. And Oh ya...i'm 23 now...gotta use it before i lose it.  Now back to deep thinking and things of that nature.  Its about that time fellow humans...and NO i'm NOT talking about the superbowl...NO i'm not talking about someones "time of the month" and NO i'm not talking about lunch...The time when all the animals come out to play..with each other.. The dawn of mating season for all of the creatures is about to begin..soon it will be upon us, and when the dawn breaks,  walking five feet without seeing 2 rabbits making sweet bunny love will become a rarity.  Mating season is something that applies to all animals, not just the furry ones(shut it and shave it)...we humans are about to kick into the mode where we have to prep ourselves to look the best we can for the opposite sex.  People who havent set foot on a treadmill will begin running like it's their job.  In the winter, we cover up as much skin as possible, and during mating season, we show as much skin as possible without getting arrested. It's a time to do whatever it takes to make yourself a theoretical marketing success...you want to be a hot product, that EVERYONE wants to buy. Time to SELL away. Now that sort of sounds pretty bad, whorish and cheap, but thats how we are created, that's our nature, that is nature.  There are just some facts of life that we cant deny at all..they are built in.. Nature says that all creatures will have the obligation to mate..thats right people...all creatures...male rabbits need to mate just as much as female ones.. The question is though...what kind of mate does each of us want?  Not every creature is looking for the same kind of creature...there are many different things that are taken into consideration when deciding if we want to mate with someone or not.. First there are a few categories of the type of mate we want.  Some rabbits are looking for rabbits they can have a long term rabbit thing with..while other rabbits are looking for a one time rabbit fuckfest.  Now of course as nature would have it, girl rabbits are more prone to be looking for the long term rabbit thing, but that is not always the case..there are alot of girls who just love good sex...and bad sex..just sex in general.. Anyway, finding the perfect mate for yourself is never an easy task, unless you're lucky and get a royal flush on the first deal.  But most of us have horrible horrible luck. If i knew a statistician, I think i would make a webpage that helped you figure out the chance of you finding YOUR perfect mate. You would type in things about your life via a survey type interface(ooo lets get all techinical), and then things about your ideal mate...then on the server side of the web page..a trained statistics monkey would figure out the probability that you will find your ideal mate, and then send it back to the user..who in turn will look at the screen and say..."Fuck...I guess it's time to move to cali."   It's common knowledge that finding someone who is perfect for you is nearly impossible.  All rabbits have a predetermined idea of what their perfect mate is like.  Since most of us know we don't have a snowball's chance in hell of actually finding that person, we have some thinking to do(or you can just not think and do everything of or resembling the opposite sex). In this time before the main event, mating season 2003, begins we must figure out what areas of our idea of the perfect mate we're willing to do without.  Perhaps a girl with a mustache ISNT THAT BAD...ok no wait...I take that back. This is the time us humans should think about things like this..because we can. Those dumb fucking rabbits can't think to this capacity..so they just mate with whatever...and their buddies don't bust their balls for doing that really really freaky chick with the messed up ear.  Think about what you want..what is necessary in your perfect mate(long or short term, or once and say goodbye term, whatever your flavor is) and what is not.  People who are too idealistic will be stuck with no mate and a sticky hand..while people who have no ideals will not only be laughed at by friends and non friends alike for what they did last night, but they will also kill of any bit of self esteem they may have, contract some fun diseases, and live a life of regret and shame(and really what fun is that?).  So rabbits, get your brains in gear...think some..guys,use your bigger head(hopefully) before your little head leads you to rosie o'donnel, and girls go ahead and do that guy that looks like gilbert gottfried..so i can LAUGH at you and tell you to come back and read this next year because the damage is done already.  Think before you pink.  Peace Love and happy fucking. The man, The myth, the mother fucking legend, Me
