Quick check -  Rather than talking to myself (been home alone too long lol) i'm writing stuff on the 'net that noone will ever read!!! awesome huh?   Todays thoughts -   a)  I miss Rachel. Shes been away for a long time, and after she phoned me on Monday, and talked to me on MSN today I now really miss her. Few people get my sense of humor, and I don't blame them, but she always did... no good can come of her Germanic lifestyle!  b)  I can't name my new emotion!!!! It's sort of a cross between knowing that christmas (or other good thing) is really close, but you aren't there yet, and what happens when you have too much caffeine. I blame Lauren.x  c)  Somehow I've upset Joe. end of thought.  Still, lets not go on, i'll save that for another posting...  (today I was mostly listening to Brand New - Play Crack The Sky)  see y'all later. xx
