However at our new apartment in Chennai my next door neighbour is Susi Ganesan (former assistant of Maniratnam  Tamil Film Director who directed Five Star  Virumbugiren) and on my Upper floor is Kunal (The Hero of Kaadhalar Dhinam). Though I do not know Kunal very well , Susi Ganesan is a very good friend.Being a film junkie myself , I discuss a lot about films with him .      He had invited me out for Dinner just before I left for Singapore . We discussed the screenplay of his upcoming movies and he was quite forthcoming in sharing the ideas with me. He also shares the insider titbits on the working of the film industry and its always interesting to listen.I have this secret dream of making at leasta documentary film in my life  and those thoughts always get stirred when I talk to him.Who knows I might do it one day ....
