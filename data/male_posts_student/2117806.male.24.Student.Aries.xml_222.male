They were a bit more expensive than I was given to believe they were, mostly because of handling fees and whatnot.  I swear, you'd think that the fact they charge at least $45 or $50 per ticket already would be enough, but then they add on another ten dollars or so of fees per ticket (ours came to a total of $109.75).  Ah well--I get to see Dylan in September now.  Woot!  Now I must be off.  Gonna hang out with Ev for a while before heading to Shawnee for the night.  Laundry, free food, and being pestered by my youngest brother--another typical Shawnee visit.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Waitin' for Superman"
