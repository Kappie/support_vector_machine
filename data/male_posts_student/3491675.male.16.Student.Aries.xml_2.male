Im free, from the roach infested, place called summer school, i have a sore back as a suveneir, damn chair's, this leads me to another topic, now that im free this has cleared up 7.5 hrs in a day of noting to do there are many things to do but after a while i'll probboly have done everything. call this the 2nd sight but i see myself doing alot more cooking than usuall and working on organising my room which will take about 2 day's, becouse oncei start cleaning my mind eye sees something and starts reminicing. I might as weel go back to doing my art projects becouse those projects of mine take up alot of space, either that i can go to the bookstore and catch up on my literature. I sent a friend of mine (who i will call anonymous) an e-mail which sounded very, very random, sorry if it doesn't make sense.
