You were acting suspiciously, no matter how hard you tired to hide.. how serious u tried to be... i was able to spot you out. Your words were doubtful. Didn't we promised to be true to each other? I guess i too naive, i guess the trust had been broken, i guess i knew what would happened, always believed that there was another party, but why am i still so sad when you told me about him? I thought i already knew?! You told me that he took you for granted but why you still love him? Thats love... same as my love for you.. i chose to love someone that wasn't worthy of it, someone cheated me, someone played with me, a someone who is unfamiliar to me now... i don't love you anymore... Still, the same old tune brings me back to memories lane... I had listened to this music thousand of times. Someday i found this poignant version, also closest to the one we used to listen together.. My mind overwhelmed with you again, everything seems back in time... Yes. We can actually go back in time with the help of wonderful memories. I really feel the presence there? But for sad memories, they are something that we will forget sooner than what we expect. without the feelings with the memories, i doubt we can return to time? But would you go back if you cannot change anything? Just let the tragic repeat once in your mind...
