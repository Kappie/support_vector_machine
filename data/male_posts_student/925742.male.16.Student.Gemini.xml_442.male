I don't know......  I just know pain will make me stronger.  Every song I hear, for instance.......oh well, she's a great friend.  I feel so....... stupid...... when I'm confronted with these presenters, and the fact that I'm not in any AP yet or summer classes only heightens that feeling.  I will take a summer college course next summer, but this one will be devoted to Driver's Ed and working.  I know I can make a success of myself if I follow my plans:  take AP next year, summer courses, volunteer, become a supervisor, and get goooooooooooood grades. Also: take ACTs in June.  I can do all this and am striving for the best without snapping myself.  I'd say I'm doing a fairly good job.  I learned that I need to reduce my anger......... a lot.  Way more reducing than I have been.  More later.
