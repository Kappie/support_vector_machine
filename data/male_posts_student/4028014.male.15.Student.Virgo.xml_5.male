Hope i will pass this paper... *fingers crossed* This year have been a very stressful year... My Design and Technology projectwork's date due is drawing nearer... Cannot make it... Thank googness it will be over in a few months time... Good Luck guys!!! Do the best that you can do! And may the Force be with you!  Just now in D room got scolded for nothing... i was being accused of wanting to drop my D Hello!!! Can you please get a life??? Do i look as if i will drop my subjects so easily??? I just commented that i don't wish to doi it today and you go aroung telling the teachers that i want to give up??? Can you please go and dig you ears? please don't keep bragging and insult people's work will you? You are so ironic!!! You are hired as a workshop instructor to teach us how to handle sophisticated machines and help us with it, not to boss us around!!! Whatever it is, i am not going to depend on you... i am doing it myself and my own way...  What really makes my blood boils is when i got back my results for the Algebra quiz... Even though i just passed the papaer, however, i have made loads of careless mistakes!!! Argh!!! This is really fustrating!!! Seeing that you could get the marks but just because of some carelessness, you lost it, it really hurts!!! Moreover i didn't reached my teacher's expectation, meaning i have to retake the quiz tomorrow after school!!! Sigh... Tomorrow will be a boring day...  That's all folks!!! Good Day to you all!!!
