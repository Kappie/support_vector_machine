Writing these chronicles has been a memorable journey, and they are as indelible as the actual journey itself. I am less motivated than before to continue writing the series, and its partly because I've moved on with diabetes. What better than to end on a good note.  Rest assured, efforts will still be on to maintain the heavenliness of this abode.  Thanks for stopping by, and for the comments, ofcourse.
