I wondered about this... and I found the reason: by the end of this month, I will have had a 4-H overnight/week-long trip every week this month and 2 weeks of last month. I could say I've spent a total of 1/2 to 1/3 of my summer on 4-H. To quote Neo, "Woah." - Well, State Congress was pretty nice, now that I've had some rest. - (The Positive) I placed second; I saw many of my friends, alot from GOT; I talked to Mrs. Cheryl and making Tech Team sounds like a good possibility; I got closer to many people; I spent some quality time with this pretty girl named Morgan; Six Flags was fun; I love lookin' so fresh and so clean; I met a new person from Tift County (after running, it's hard to find someone new); I beat someone who kinda gets on my nerves - (The Negative) I placed second; I saw many people that get on my nerves; I had roommates from hell*; I didn't have a choice about that quality time; I got too close to some people; My feet hurt from those damn dress shoes every day; That kid from TIft County has a head so big it will float away by 2005. What a jerk. - Now it's time for one of my favourite events of the year... THE TUBING RALLY! I never thought it could get better... until I got elected, that is. It will be so fun! The skit is hilarious and everything is so great. My mum will be going as an adult leader. How neat! - Tech team announcements are at the beginning of the week. Yay!
