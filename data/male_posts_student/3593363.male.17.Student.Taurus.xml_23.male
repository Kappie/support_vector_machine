Then i tried to solve lindseys problems on the phone, and talked to Christy on the phone returning her call. Our relationship is pretty much random phone calls.  Worked. Then Lindsey and Sara came into work and we picked up Ian and went to my house. Played pool then Lindsey took Sara home and came back. Then we chatted. LL and I are gonna hook them up. Then Ian had to go so i took him home, went inside and looked at his room. We're gonna start a venture crew real soon.  Lindsey and I have finally got all this crap worked out, and she's the best friend I'll ever have. Even though her boyfriend hates me because i tried to steal her, she still hangs out with me all the time, and if i ever needed someone to talk to, she'd be there. If only she knew how great she is.  Life. It's just getting to the point where i don't know what i want with it anymore. I don't know why i'm so miserable, the things i want and can't have will never be there so i have to deal with it. Friendships keep getting worse, but on the other hand I;m making new friends like Ian and heather, and Lindsey and I are 'better' after all the crap going on at the end of the school year. Everythings getting disorganized, but i can clean it. I just don't know whats so wrong with me
