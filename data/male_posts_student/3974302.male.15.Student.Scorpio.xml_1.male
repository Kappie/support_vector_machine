You need to be able to spend time online, often, working on this. For the new leaders, you will need to choose a  urlLink government type , or make one. Our Ideas have changed. The story, to save me a whole bunch of legal troubles, is not going to be based on battletech. Yeah, I know that sucks. But if we based it on Battletech, I would have to work outkiller legal matters with Microsoft, and I would probably make a wrong step and end up getting sued, which would suck. We can still make the galaxy, but I am going to be making an all new backstory for it. Which will take me forever. But hey, it's just a means to an end. I GET TO WASH DISHES ALL DAY TODAY! Great. Culinary Arts is nearing the end of it's usefulness. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
