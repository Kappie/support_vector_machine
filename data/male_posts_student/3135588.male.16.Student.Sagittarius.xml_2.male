Don't celebrate yet, il be coming back next sunday ;-p I seem to have started talking with nothing on my mind. Incessant babble it is then.  I shall start with something that may bore all not interested in the slightest with football. I shall talk about yesterday's appauling show of referee skills. Where was "Terry's hand in the keepers face"??? all i can see is the keepers fat fist in Terry's face! Terry's hand blatantly went down past the keepers shoulder!!! We played a hard match both against Portugal  and  the referee last night. Well done lads. My congratumalations go out to Joe Cole and to Lampard. Both of whom did not deserve to be on a losing team. Both players played a world class match, against a sunday league referee. What was the deal with the penalty spot? That spot was as flat as (insert chosen supermodels name)'s chest! Why did the referee not change ends? even Ronaldo had trouble with it! (he stil scored tho >:-( i'm beginning to doubt Beckham)  This random moan was bought to you by Jim x
