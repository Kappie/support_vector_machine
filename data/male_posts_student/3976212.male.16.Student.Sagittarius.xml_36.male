I put something infront of my door, took a sleeping pill and finally fell a sleep...at like 3:30. It was crazy. I actually woke up at about 1:30 which isnt too bad, but I really wanna try to get up earlier than that for tommorow because I really need to put out resumes! Thats just another day in my boring life. Actually no. But we are in another (mini) heat wave again which is hella nice, tommorow is getting up to 30+ again which is soo nice. I talked to my grandmother yesterday night and she said I will have to call my phone company (fido) or should I say my ex-phone company cause all we got here is telus, bell and rogers. Fido and sprint are Vancouver only...stupid ass middle of no-where town! I actually bothered to have a shower/get dressed today. I also went for my bike ride. It was a shorter bike ride than usual, but I will prolly go on a short one a little later this evening as well.
