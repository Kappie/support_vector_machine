I ordered a King-size Double Bacon Cheeseburger meal, and when I pulled through and got it out to devour, I found there was only  one  patty on my burger!! I demanded we turn around and they handed me another burger and said, "Sorry about that. Have a nice day." And we just pulled off -- so I got a burger for free. Hehe  This morning we got up and went to  urlLink Penn's Cave . I was really upset, though, because the water level was too high to take the boat out on the lake, so we just went around the cave. It was kind of boring, and the water kept dripping down in the cave and it was really upsetting me.  After Penn's Cave we went to State College. I went to Abercrombie and got a couple things.        Then we went to  urlLink Nittany Mall . That's dissapointing. I haven't been there in like three years. I like our mall better. I didn't get anything from there. There wasn't anything good I saw. Then we stopped at the Super Wal Mart in Mill Hall on the way home. I got a couple school supplies there.  I came home, and my grandparents from out of town are in ... I have to work tomorrow at Lock Haven store.  Random Thought: What made Alexander Grahm Bell, the inventor of the telephone, come and stay overnight at Penn's Cave, and tour the cave??  I like ... Frank Sinatra I hate ... melting blizzards or any kind of ice cream
