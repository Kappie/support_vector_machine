ShuChoMouff: i was like "buh buh buh BULLSHIT!!!" granmastabizwakee: and then you were sad because noone heard you ShuChoMouff: right  Hmm...  Everybody just needs to calm the fuck down. Everybody is so tense and asshole-ish latley. I noticed that my speakers were plugged in wrong, and that I didn't do it, so I asked my parents if they did anything to them(nicely), and they get all indignant on me! They go "Well quit accusing us, we didn't do anything!"  And i keep saying "Calm down! Calm down! I'm not freakin accusing you of anything!!!!"  But they just keep bitching and bitching and bitching!  And a friend of mine fucking goes berserk on another guy a few days ago, the other guy was asking him a question or something and my friend hits him in the back of the neck with a tennis racket! I was like "Dood! What was that for?" and he said "He's fucking pissing me off!"  I didn't get why he was PMSing or something that day, but i was trying not to get pissed myself, so i just sat down.  Why don't we all just sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up???  I'm trying to listen to music, and this guy who sits next to me in Web2 (who probably knows that everyone in the world fucking hates him, but he tries anyway) keeps trying to show me his mediocre flash movies, and i just keep ignoring him, because we both know that i don't give a flying fuck about his cartoonage, but he still shows me. I know that everybody knows that i'm good at flash, good for you guys, but that doesn't mean i get to be bothered by people i don't know/don't like.   Don't get me wrong, i like my friends, they're cool, but people on average are selfish assholes who need to be beaten. This has led to my catch phrase, shouting "WHO ARE YOU?!?!?!" (i know that was stolen from mall monkeys, but Keith isn't here, is he?) at people.  Like, this guy, Rico i think, we're sitting at our lunch table one day talking about something(probably Binh playing DDR and Alex stealing Dan's racket while David eating food and me bitching about whatever), and this guy comes up (NONE of us know him) and just sits down and asking us what's up and how our day was! I was like "WHO ARE YOU?!?!?" with my arms all in the air and stuff, and he's like "Rico. What's up homes?"  I just give him this look like "what the hell are you doing here? Leave. Now." and he just sits there like a fucking loon with his thumb up his ass, then goes to leave to walk around with this wigger and some other dude.  Whatever. Just, whatever.  I'm gonna go... downstairs... or something.
