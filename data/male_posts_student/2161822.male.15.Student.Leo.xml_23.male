Anyway, it's finally the weekend and another exciting Friday night in Hazleton. This isn't a good post since I have no clue what to write about. Nothing really happened in school worth telling about. Except the whole dinosaur girl thing. Man that's great. Dinosaur and her caveman will take over Hafey someday. Someday...
