Most of them are one and half hour long classes - now, however good a prof may be, one and a half hours of continuous listening is a bit too much to expect.  Have recently started reading a book called 'Any human heart' by William Boyd. It's in the form of a private diary. From whatever I've read so far, it seems quite a good book - the celebration of a simple life.
