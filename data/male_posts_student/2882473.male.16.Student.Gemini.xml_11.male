Well when I say "house" it was only a hole in the ground covered by a piece of tarpolin, but it was a house to US. - A little Monty Python there. Aaaaaaanyway. I started writing this post about an hour ago, but got distracted with.... editing the Matrix script to fit....yes, well, you get the point. It's about 21:30, so I'm off for the night, toodles all.
