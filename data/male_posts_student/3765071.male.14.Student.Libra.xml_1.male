"I deserve this" my mind tells me. So following a trip to the lavatory to release waste, I make my way to the garage. Seconds before, I remember my last runnin with Mr. Dan Rather, him telling the viewers that the ozone has grown weak. So, I think to myself...I have yet to see the light of day for several weeks. Destruction could have reigned over the world. I worry to the thought that the sky may be dripping acid rain, and that it will be seeping through the garage roof. So, I decide to make my trip fast and gather enough goods to last me for two months. I duck my head, cover myself in five rain coats, and make a strong effort to move fast. I luckily make it out of the garage with seven cans of carbonated soda, three cans of Campell's long lasting noodle soup, and my extra copy of Bob Marley's  Legend .   Over several hours of playing  Red Dead Revolver , I check the state of my surroundings, and notice that the raining has come to a hault. The surroundings around me are worse then I imagined. I take a quick glance to the left. I see a teenaged, Greek looking boy, using some kind of machine to chop the grass on his lawn. He wairs no shirt, I am disgusted. I retreat to the lavatory were I would orally release three pints of already eaten food. My spirits were at a low.  Soon after four hours of revolving around my coffee table, I come to the conlusion I will die without entertainment, or something to keep me busy. So, I take a quick look to the right, and see in the mist of all the darkness,  Legend , the Bob Marley and The Wailers compilation.   I insert the compilation into the compact disc player. I leisurly turn to the second track. "No Woman No Cry" begins playing. The beauty of the song intrigues me, and I fall into a spectacular trance, and slowly drift away into slumber.  I wake up in a happy world where the Sun shines, disfigured Greek boys keep their shirts on, Rather tells positive stories, there is no acid rain, and Metal music is dead. The dream continues with adventures through mountains of the Moon, through Cumberland mines, and through marijuana fields of terrific sents.  I continue to sleep for one thousand years, and finally wake up in a world looking for change. I finally decide to attempt to make a difference, and change the world.   Farewell children. Learn from the story.
