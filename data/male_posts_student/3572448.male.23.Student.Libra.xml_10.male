       
      so i decided to explore myself (not like that, don't be sick).  I'm trying out my green thumb in the back yard (again, don't be sick).  I bought an Allamanda and a Texas sage and planted them in our little garden area of our back yard.  Its kinda neat growing things, but people look at me funny whenever you talk about it.  Also, i've been running periodically the last couple of weeks, it feels good to be active again.  I bought a pair of running shoes and basketball shoes so now i have no excuse.  I managed to juke the rubber right off my first pair of running shoes (which i only had a week), so i made the plunge and finally bought another pair.  I had to stop 3 times when running around the lake tonight, but i don't think its bad considering i don't remember the last time i ran--any distance--at all--period.  Also i'm just about done reading Siddhartha, actually re-reading, but i like the book and decided to read it again...what to read next...OH, i also made an A in cs336.  this is turning into the summer of Matt after all, i feel like i'm growing as a person.  good times.
