Bibek later decided that he didn’t need to wear it. Bibek asked to me if I would like to wear it. Having interest in caps I took the hat from Bibek and wore it. I should say I looked alright in the mirror. Thinking about the cap I totally forgot that I had made plans to go to the Saint Dannis Centre. Anita, my cousin called me and asked if I was ready to go. I had to do hurry up. I threw the cap which I was wearing, under the bed. I went to the Saint Dannis Centre and forgot all about the location of the cap. The cap probably stayed there for probably more than a week. Today, May 17, I finally found that cap. Ravi, the first cap-lord asked me why I ditched the cap. To answer his question I am writing this essay. I guess throwing the cap under the bed was one of the errors my mind made.
