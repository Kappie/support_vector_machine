With us were Cullen's  urlLink dad and his partner in business .   While we were there we engaged in all sorts of fun activities. I went on two trail rides, and got my horseback riding juices back, so I could relive the dream of having a horse and a big wide area to just run around in all day. The second ride was the coolest, because we stopped in the middle of nowhere where there was a campsite, and ate breakfast, then got back on our horses and kept going. It could be the best breakfast I've had in a while. And you  know  I ate a lot of bacon. The horse in front of me farted a lot though.    We also went down to the lake and swam around, and checked out bikinis, and suntanned, and tried to catch turtles. Cullen's dad (who came to Mather for 60 years straight!) told us the technique. When the turtles get close to the edge, close enough to dive to, you jump off the shore and try to smack the turtle. Then they'll pull into their shell and just float, and you can grab 'em. I tried this twice. I fell just an inch short the first time and he swam away. The second time he swam away just as I came down but I just brought my hands down hard and smacked him like 6 inches below the surface. Of course I also smacked my belly and face. And he got away anyway. It was a lot of fun though.   We also went to these Indian locations, where there are still small arowheads and flakes from their creation. We hunted a total of about two and a half hours over the trip, and we got six arrowheads.   We also went down to dirt roads and I learned how to drive. Well, it was really really intuitive so basically I learned how for about one minute then drove for about an hour.    Around the house, when we had nothing to do outside, we would usually sit around and talk and make as many yo momma jokes as possible. Or we would eat. Or sleep. While Cullen slept, since I can't really nap, I worked on my cardhouse skills. I invented a new kind called a labrynth. My largest was 7x7 squares.   Cullen brought his CO 2  pellet gun so we also shot that when we were bored.   Early in the morning we went fishing. Ken, Cullen, and I each caught a fish over the three times we went. Sometimes Ken's other friend Roggy would come with his kid. Roggy was kickass. He was a lawyer too, but also a drummer for a bunch of bands. I got a whoel bunch of photos of the river we fished at so I will post those on deviant urlLink ART .   At night we would go down to the lodge and get cokes from the bar and shoot pool. It was a great time.
