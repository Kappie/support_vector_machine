I have a headache that would birth Athena. (Bonus Points for anyone who can tell me what the hell that means)     I read something interesting today and I've been thinking about it for about an hour now: If a tree falls and rises again in the forest, but no one was there to see it, did it really ever die? The nature of things is odd. Human beings define themselves by time. Without time there is no context to judge historical action, so without time there would be no culture before us. The present is an endless storm of errands and pointless activities that only serve to detract from the greater meaning of what we are doing on earth. The future has exponential potential and as such can never truly be defined or studied in such a way as to predict a viable outcome. These "truths" are all taken from the human perspective. A tree has no concept of time. Ergo, whither the tree ages, grows, expands, and eventually dies is irrelevant because the tree will eventually re-grow and begin again in exactly the same situation as its "predecessor" until, the ancestor and youth became one and the same. This creates an effect refererd to in  Escape from the Planet of The Apes  as Infinite perspective. Lets use an example: A painter paints a landscape. And yet something is missing to him, so he draws a second portrait, one of himself painting the first portrait. But, there is still something that he feels is wrong, so he paints a third portrait, one of himself drawing the painting of drawing the painting. This carries on until we have a portrait of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture of the painter drawing a picture, etc, etc Until the perspectives meld and the observer becomes the observed and time is infinitely perceivable.    And on a much lighter note two things to leave you with: I Get to go see Phantom Of the Opera tomorrow! Hells yes! and   Mr. Giant Taco Inventor   Bud lite presents: Real men of Genius ( Real men of genius ) Today we salute you, Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor ( Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor ) A culinary creation that baffles the human mind, A 12,000 calorie salad ( Aie Carumba! ) Ground Beef, Refried Beans, Guacamole,  Cheese, Sour Cream, and, if there's any room left a few shreds of lettuce ( I don't see no lettuce! ) Some may ask "Is you taco salad healthy?" Of coarse it is. Its a salad, isn't it?
