Finished the test in a hour and a half, then had to sit around for another hour, doing nothing....In a blazing hot gym that smelt like sweat. Bah, came home, sat I my nice cool house...Listened to music, went on my favorite forums and what not.   O yeah, the fathers day gift came in the mail today. We got him an alright digital camera, a Canon Powershot A75. Then, my brothers birthday gift came ( he is going to be...... 23... I think O_O). He's big into things with cars and travel, so we bought him a handheld GPS Navigator... Looks like a cell-phone, but its just a whole screen with a directional pad. Pretty cool if you ask me.  Waiting for my dad to get home so we can go get something to eat...Maybe later I will go see Dodgeball.... I'll see when I'll get there.  Until next time.
