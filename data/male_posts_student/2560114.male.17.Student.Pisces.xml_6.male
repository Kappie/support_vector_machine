It was coo, but borin cuz i went cuz my mom wants to know about financial aid and what is required for me to get in a good school...thanx mom. Anywayz im lookin foward to the upcoming up volleyball tournament (already have 203 killz...w00t), so i guess me and my teammates r gonna try to pull for 1st and also beef up my stats, which is not as important as winning. So i might write something later on, but until then...the saga continues.  The new song that is now stuck in my head, not really new but yeah  John Mayer-My Stupid Mouth   My stupid mouth Has got me in trouble I said too much again To a date over dinner yesterday And I could see She was offended She said "well anyway..." Just dying for a subject change  Oh, another social casualty Score one more for me How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one soon  We bit our lips She looked out the window Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker And I could see clearly An indelible line was drawn Between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget?  Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now  One more thing Why is it my fault? So maybe I try too hard But it's all because of this desire I just wanna be liked, I just wanna be funny Looks like the jokes on me So call me captain backfire  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again. It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now
