( the oil was buring in a wok) ..i eventually let her dump the wet towel over it .. lisa was making a big f deal about nothing.   today morning she says that she wants to have a talk and dredges up topics on how i stole her comp. excuse me i borrowed it and i just didnt tell her when i was gonna return home anyway .. mistrustful bitch .. so she starts off by saying some crap about the atmosphere and ... goes on raising her voice .. i told her that im keeping to my own .. and not troubling her .. she also said some shit that she had complained to the police about the comp.she added that i was showing attitude , i told her not to raise her voice .. well she went on yelling somethin i wasnt paying attention . she said that im supposed to buy stuff for the house .. if she wants to she can .. im done with her . i aint cleaning stuff/ buyng anything thats not required for me.  she said that i dont say bye while leaving the house ..... who is she, that i must answer to her ? if i go on like this i will end up huring ppl and i will be all alone. as though i care. i care about a few ppl thats all, others dont matter ,never have never will.shes the one with issues, u stay out of my way and i will out if your way . i dont ask her to speak to me. no wonder none of her bfs stick around. ( i know that sounds rude. but like i said i dont care)  well shes suposed to leave today . for the weekend she still hasnt .shes probably going to leave a whole lot of "post it notes" all over the house ....   i have an answer to all post it notes. "whatever" (as jen said .. its a polite way of saying fu)  damn some ppl . why cant they let me be.
