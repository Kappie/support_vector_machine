Every time I'd go there as a little child, I'd always run to the children's section. Now that I am older and my thoughts turned towards the loftier things of life, I find books like this in my search. I didn't borrow it and won't, but it's fun to know that such a book exists.  Icthus has come and gone and with great pleasure. Seminars, food, fellowship (or the lack), and such music as I love. It saddens me that I'm such a loner, I can't even strike up or follow a conversation with fellow Christians. It's that bad. One must accept his weaknesses and move on, I suppose.  Finished Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Many interesting interconnections with Miracles by C.S. Lewis. I find his eventual definition of God as "energy" most amusing and out of touch with my views. But otherwise, it's good stuff. I firmly believe that science and religion are not only different sides of a coin, but almost the black and white of a yin-yang. What good is science if you do not believe in the reasoning of man? How can a theist see miracles if there is no normal background to place them against? They need each other.
