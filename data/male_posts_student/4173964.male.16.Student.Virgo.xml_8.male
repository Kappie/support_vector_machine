Here goes  My heart is like fine China A beautiful thing to behold yet just as easily broken And once it has shattered it can never be repaired ....I want a fat bottom girl.... *Tear* Why does it sting when I pee....  Yeah there ya go. My best Jessie impersonation. Anyhoo...getting ready for work again. I loves me that vehicular orifice pumping. Uuummmm stayed up all night and read the Beach by Alex Garland again. Best book I've ever read. I'm dead tired now but whatever. I'll just drink a shitload of coffee and coke and such at work. Kill Bill vol 2 comes out today. I'm going after work to buy it. AND Alien vs Predator comes out this Friday. Could this week get any better? Well yeah absolutely but...you know... Yeah this has been pretty pointless I just felt like writing something.
