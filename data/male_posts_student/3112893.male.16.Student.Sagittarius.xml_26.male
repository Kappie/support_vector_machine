     
      Alright, I can't take it anymore! I have to say this out loud. My parents have fucked up big time over the majority of the past 7 years of home schooling me. The only two good things that "they" did for me was done by my dad (who, trust me on this, fucked in many other areas to balance it out to the far negative). He put me in Harvard Extension classes in which I had the best time I've ever had and he took me to work with him on a regular basis where I got to work on cool electrical engineering problems and interact with some of the greatest up and coming minds. I thank him profusely for that and my appreciation is undying for the good things that he's done. But shit, man, there is too much that just WASN'T FUCKING DONE for my education.  Let me introduce you to my family during the turn of the millennium. My father, after getting his Ph.D in elementary particle physics at UCLA decided that it would be a good idea to move to Boston* and get yet another degree, but this time from the most prestigious technical university in the world, MIT. This was a great move for me in a lot of ways. I got to see Boston, the place that I consider to be my true home. I also got to hang around MIT and, as I've said, chat with great minds. It inspired me to be great, but here's where a great plan goes sour.  My dad had already accumulated a lot of debt from being a student and having to support a family for 10 years so we couldn't afford much of anything other than the bare essentials. Even when discussion for supplies such as textbooks came up, it was actually debated as to whether it was worth the money even if we could afford it. Now, I don't mean to knock my mom too much, but I'm just trying to state facts here. My mom has always had what she called a "pragmatic" mentality so whenever such a discussion would come up, the first thing that came to mind was not the possible payback of investments in our (my sisters and my) education, but rather the financial burden of it. Whether that attitude was entirely a bad thing for me is kinda debatable, but it led to MANY extremely unproductive days where I would surf the net looking for things like sports stats, game strategeries, and funny pictures. At least I learned how to use google like a master :-\.  Anyway, my parents also didn't clean up the legal issues of us being home schooled so my sister and I have been both   technically   playing hooky for the past 8 years, which is a bit of a problem because if either of us want to go back to a public school, we can't really because my parents could be charged with what's-it-called (essentially being reckless with your kids and not being responsible and bla bla bla). It's not like either of us want to go back to school, but still, having the option open is nice.  Well, after my dad got promoted through a very confusing set of hoops from graduate student to research scientist**, things were starting to look up. We had to move out of our old apartment because he wasn't a student, so the cost of rent went WAY up, but it was ok because he got a big fat raise. I got my first personal computer that year. It was an Apple 300Mhz Tangerine iBook. I used it for things like logo, starlogo, java coding, web surfing, and gaming (only old games, though. It wasn't exactly top notch graphics-wise).  I also got my first math textbooks in 3 years that year. My dad had been looking but wasn't satisfied with what was out there until he found a publishing company called Key Curriculum Press. He bought the first two years of the Integrated Math Program (IMP). I had a tough time with them, but was always hesitant to ask for his help because for one, he'd get mad at my inability to figure it out faster than I was and would hit me in the head (sometimes he'd to more than that too (I've got enough stories to fill a book (and not a small one), lemme tell ya) (that's really helpful for learning, ya know)), and because he'd always pat himself on the back for finally finding a book that was good enough for me. So after a while of hating math just because of my father's immaturity, I got over it and started again when I was 14.  This time instead of asking my dad for help though, I'd use the internet and I'd ask the MIT undergrads for help with my Algebra I and Geometry problems. Once I knew my resources and had them set up, I was breezing through my books and ended up doing over 3 years of math in a couple months. That was a big and much-needed boost for my ego. After I finished all of my math books, I moved on to reading every book that was on the shelves in my house that had more words that I could understand than words that I didn't. Mind you, we had a lot of bookshelves that were pretty full of big books. I finished that self-assigned task before the start of the summer***.  After that I had little left to do academically in terms of what I had resources for so I started playing soccer and computer games. I went to Brigg's Field (The massive field at MIT where one can join any number of pick-up games between April and October) everyday for 5 hours and played the entire time. When I wasn't at the field, I was either outside practicing my skills or inside playing StarCraft. This was the summer before the attacks of september 11th.  Somehow I managed to slip into laziness and didn't do an ounce of productive work for an entire year and a half. As much it may be my fault for not finding something to do, I didn't have a whole lot to do so I continued to play soccer and computer games all day.  When the following winter**** ended, my dad set my up for a couple Harvard Extension classes of my choice. I chose An Introduction to Digital Logic Physics-123b and The Language, History and Culture of Indo-Europeans (I forget the exact names, but I think those are pretty close. I got a B- in the Linguistics class and a C+ in my Electronics class, but I left a bigger (positive) impression on my teachers than those grades would lead most to believe. During that semester, my dad bought the 3rd book of IMP (but not the 4th for some reason unknown to me) and I didn't touch the thing until December 2003. I guess that really is my fault though; it was sitting around for quite a while, but remembering the struggles I went through to go through the first two books, I certainly wasn't looking forward to this one.  Summer (2003) passed again without any work getting done, except this time there wasn't any soccer either because MIT kicked all the soccer players off the field for tearing the field up with their cleats. I got really mad when they kicked us off because it's a goddamn field; that's what it's there for. Autumn came and I was enrolled again in Harvard Extension classes. This time I chose American Political Thought and Introductory German. I had a really hard time with a rally bad teacher and decided to drop it. It wasn't just me though, a bunch of people dropped the course for that reason. I managed to get a solid B in my hardcore government course. That professor may quite possibly the best I ever learn from. I felt particularly proud of myself that semester because I got an A- on my first of two papers (my second was like a B or B- :-\). I also learned a valuable lesson: Study for finals. They'll kick you in the ass if you don't.  My mom moved out from the apartment to Los Angeles in like September or October of 2003 (I don't remember that date too well) to pursue some kinda ridiculous acting career with my little sister. Over half of my family is fucking retarded, I know. They make me want to vomit sometimes with the things they say, think, and do. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm no perfect person, but I think I'm doing pretty well for the shit that's been dealt. Anyway, they moved out and I had a lot of responsibility put on me all at once. I now had to do all the laundry, all the cooking, all the cleaning, and all the shopping, on top of my already full-ish academic plate. Thanks, mom.  So time went by and my relationship with Shannon (9 months at the time) began to wear thin so, along with the number of opportunities that my uncles had set up for me at UCLA, I decided to move to California in January of 2004 to help keep the relationship going. Whenever I think about it, I miss her. I am so stupid; not for missing her, but for doing all the things I did that she just didn't deserve. Ok, I should change the subject before I bury myself with a feeling of regret and feel the desire to kill myself.  Moving on, I was now in LA and things were starting to pick up again. I picked up my math book again and was going through it (slowly... very slowly). I also set myself up for volunteer positions at UCLA hospital as a Patient Escort and did that until my other two heavier-duty volunteer positions (research and personal work for professors) fell into place. They eventually did and I worked really hard on both of them. It looks like I'll be getting two recommendation letters and my name as an author on a neuro-science paper (in a very new, unexplored, and exciting part, I might add).  My mom had found and got a job at the Beverly Wilshire hotel (with a great deal of help from my uncle's girlfriend) and had been working there for a couple months but got fired before her three month probation period was up. My mom was unemployed for a while, but started to find things to do around the house and on the internet. Even though she was home a lot of the time, she's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and therefore couldn't help me on my math except listen to my rants about how much I hate it.  We now go back to April/May 2004. My mom had been talking to this guy who she thought was kind of attractive and wanted to divorce my dad because he was "too angry" for her and "she just couldn't take all the negative energies anymore". I'll tell you right now, I'm one of the first people to bash and make stabs at my dad, but there are a couple things that he isn't. One is "full of negative energies" and the other is "an angry guy". If he ever gets angry, it's provoked and he's got some tolerance before he blows. He even lets you know before he's about to get pissed off; he'll tell you flat out "you're really pushing my buttons, I'd watch it." But no, my mom just ignores all the signs and keeps pushing him until he blows up and yells loud enough for the world to hear (you thought that was thunder? Giggles.).  Anyway, my mom's reasons were all crocks of shit because they've been together for over 17 years of bad-ass crap (most of which I've seen first hand). It was all worse than all the examples that she could site during any fight that they had about this guy. To make matters worse, she tried to hide this guy's existence from me while letting my sister know full well. The women in my family are both rotten liars and have no problem keeping a secret if it means that they will get what   they   want  when   they   want it. Feel free to IM me if you're curious about the history of my mom's marital fidelity (it's not spotless) -.-.  Now, you might wonder what this all has to do with my academics, and here's the answer: My SATs as some of you may remember were in June. I was taking a Kaplan course in May to help get my score up (it worked really well, by the way; definitely worth the money.) and I just couldn't study. "Why not go to a deli or a diner or something and study?" some might ask, here's the answer: I live in a very protective household, no matter how fucked up so I couldn't really leave. If I left they called my cell phone incessantly. If I didn't pick it up or turn it off, I would have gotten an endless speech and some yelling about how not to leave the house by myself after dark. Point is I was fucked because I didn't have anywhere to go and study and home was a battlefield because of my mom's need to fuck someone other than my dad and my dad's inability to handle the problem effectively.  So here I am now, still on year three of my math curriculum, applying to colleges in the fall with 3 letters of recommendation, a long resume of extracurriculars, no working knowledge of chemistry or physics, AP Biology, and some work experience. I wonder how I'll get everything I need before November knowing my family of self-consumed pricks.  Then again, I guess my lack of progress during the years of limited resources isn't really their fault, but mine rather for not being creative. I'm just passing the buck, aren't I?  That is all.         -- Feanor  * We arrived on the cold, foggy morning of August 9th, 1997. I was 9 years old.
