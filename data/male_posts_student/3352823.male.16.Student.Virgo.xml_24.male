I did do corn again the other day, and I suffered immensely because of it. Beh. I got corn rash all on my arms, ears, and the back of my neck. It's killer when I shower.   In other news, I'm nearly finished my script... I can actually see the end. It'll be a mixed day when I actually finish it because I've been working on it for months. I'm going to hate to have to say good-bye to those characters. Well, for the time being anyway. I almost have enough ideas for a "spin-off" type dealy. But we'll see...   I shall be going for my drivers lisence this summer. Nothing much more to say there... I'm gonna take driver's ed though so I can get my G2 by next April/May. Here's hoping!  Well I hope y'all missed me... But I will try to start blogging more now. It gets so hard in summer though because fuck all happens y'know? Wait 'till school starts up again hahaha.   'Till next time..
