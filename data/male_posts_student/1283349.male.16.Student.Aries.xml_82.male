We had pretty much a full group for both Joe's deathtastic game and Clark's rockin' Eberron game. Brian, Rob, Tim, me, Clark, Joe, Jay, Alex, and Jay's wife, Kim. I mean, frickin' A. That's a par-tay.  Oh, as far as the deathtastic game? We all died. My middle-aged, balding halfling went out in the best way, though. He screamed "BONZAI!" and leapt into the very maw of this killer dragon, with two bandoleers of flaming oil strapped across his chest. That puppylit up like a roman candle. He'll be feeling that one in the morning. Hopefully someone can recover my ashes. Oh well!  In other, boring news, I got approved for some financial assistance from my school. Basically, so long as I work 100 hours for them over the course of the school year, they'll cut the tuition a bit... ... yay? I guess. The good news is that it keeps my dad and stepmom happy, and so long as I can maintain all the other stuff, I'll have pretty much free reign during the 15 minutes of free time I have every week. Hehe.  Jam on, jam on!
