Sad, a history test was postponed.  Ya, and we also had to wear long sleeve white shirts and black long pants - starcy stuff - felt quite formal suddenly.  Other people there include my classmates Lester and Koganti, Darel and Wenhui from 3K, Roderick, senior frm BB and Daniel, fellow squad member, frm BB too. (his surname's Pflug!). Teachers were like Mr Oh and Mrs Raj.  We ate at Macs after that and we wrote our reflections there too.
