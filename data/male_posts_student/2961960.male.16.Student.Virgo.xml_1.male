When I originally found out about GMail I wasn't going to try and sign-up, but since I was getting a direct invitation I decided to try it.  So here I am, starting to record my experience with GMail.  At first I wasn't sure what to expect, I knew about the 1GB of disk space, but that was about it.  I'm finding that there are a lot of no-brainer features, like automatically creating address book entries, threading messages and replies in an easy to read format, and labeling messages rather than storing them to folders.  As the weeks go on I'll continue to post updates of my experience with GMail.  This is my first day in, so I'm just absorbing the whole thing.
