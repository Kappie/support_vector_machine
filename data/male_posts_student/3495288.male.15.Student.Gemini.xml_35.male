My goal in education is to go from Primary school to Secondarys School then go to either La Salle SIA, Shatec or Temasek Poly. Once that is over, i wanna work and have enough money for me to migrate to Canada. Once i am there, i wanna live with my sister and school in a Circus school once i graduate, i wanna join Cirque du Soleil!   Luckily i reached school JUST IN TIME. Straight after the reading period we board the bus. Some were allowed to buy some food. I did went to buy some food. Just a few sandwiches and burgers. Off we went to the stupid place. ITE - Its The End! i don't wanna go there after my secondary school education! haiz. But the chinese guys there are superbly cute though. Firstly had a boring! and long briefing about the program and school. MAN! its so boring. Then after his talk we went around the school! saw many cute guys around but NAH! i am still not coming to this institution! Then we had our tea break. Haiz... we watched a Mr Bean movie, i laughed so fakely. Then off we went to do our projects. haiz... It was kinda fun to play with the air pressure thing.. but abit too scary lah...but even though its fun.. because its like a puzzle and i love puzzles. Then we went for another break and came back doing this musical door bell. STUPID lah this part... just plain stupid. Then we all went home. YAY!   Reached school and off went to band. Well played a few scales and so on... checked out my tuba so that i can bring it home, because i wanna play Second Suite in F Major!. Then before dismissing the band.. i had to fall them in and command them. Well everyone was given 10push ups. Then i dismissed them. After that i drag my tuba to macdonalds, waited for Eddy. When Eddy and his friends came, they stood around me. I cried abit, because I do like Eddy alot but i dono if he likes me or not. He looked at me like as if he is my boyfriend. Then i went in and sat alone.  I bought a fries... then went off without telling him.  Tats all for now lah. Haiz... tired lah. Tml visiting ITE Yishun again..haiz...
