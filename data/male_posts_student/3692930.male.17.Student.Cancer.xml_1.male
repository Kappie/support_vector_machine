Anyways yesterday I was on the computer all day trying to make a website and learning how to animate in Flash MX and finished a measly 2 second animation that said a clip "the world is a vampire", from Despite All My Rage by Smashing Pumpkins. Well if you want to see the sorry excuse of a (Chobits)website I made then just click   urlLink HERE  I also working on another website made entirely of one picture via layers and slices in Photoshop. Well from now on I'm gonna try to update my thingy here 3 times a day. Here hoping I can!    "Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."  Pablo Picasso.
