I will now proceed to lay out some simple step-by-step instructions so you too can make trivial amounts of money from large, weighty tomes of knowledge with no practicality or use in our common, mundane, everyday lives. 1. Find another book of the sort you want to write, and take copious amounts of notes from it, allowing you to say absolutely nothing but fill several pages with text which, upon further inspection, repeats itself several times over.  2. Falsify a draft of your book dated several years before the text you copied from was published; upon releasing your book, sue the author of your book's inspiration. 3. Hire Johnnie Cochran. 4. Win your lawsuit in an entirely unethical manner, taking the entire sales of opponents book for your own; your book will fly off the shelves due to the media coverage that the trial should produce. 5. Retire to Monaco
