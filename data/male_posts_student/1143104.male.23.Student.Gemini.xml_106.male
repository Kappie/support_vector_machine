For the master bathroom, we chose the  Congoleum - Triumph Natural Stone . The bathroom will be very "earthy" with natural colors and patterns. For the downstairs bathroom, we're going for a two-tone look (this one is mine!) and it will be black and white. The flooring is  Armstrong - Granville White .  As soon as my parents move out, we'll be painting the bathrooms and laying down the new floor. But this is our first house purchase!
