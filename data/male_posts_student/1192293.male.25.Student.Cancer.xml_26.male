But after Saddam's fall, the United States argued they should be quickly lifted.  The resolution would give the United States and Britain broad powers to run Iraq and sell its oil to fund reconstruction until a new government is set up" Well, duh.  Who didn't see this coming?  Betcha Haliburton or Bechtel or the Carlyle Group gets to oversee the sale of all that oil.  The Bush Regime now acts as though it has nothing to fear from the truth of it's intentions.  Why?  Because the press and the Democrats are too fucking scared and weak to do anything about it.  Welcome to the future.  They parade their original intentions before the world stage, and by dropping the sanctions, give their greedy brothers-in-arms around the world a whiff of the wealth that will be leached out of the Iraqi soil.  Who will speak against them if the other countries are guaranteed a spot at the trough? Goddamn it people, this is  not right , and you all know it.    P.S.-  Here is another chunk of that same article.  Remember why we went to war in the first place?  Yeah, Dubya doesn't either.  "Before the war, President Bush repeatedly accused Iraq of having illicit weapons of mass destruction and said it would have to be disarmed by force. So far, no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been found."
