I went and bought a wireless router so now I am typing this post on my new computer sitting on my couch watching the Olympics. It is soooo cool. I love my new computer.  Oh, embarrassing thing happened to me to day. I went shopping at Wal-Mart for some food and some other things. Well, I went to grab a thing of mayo and it slipped from my hands. It fell and shattered on the ground. Since when does mayo come in glass jars again. It sucked!!! It was such a mess and I was so embarrassed that I just had to get out of there and didn't get all the things that I needed. I guess I will have to go to Albertsons some time this week to get the rest of the food that I need.  Well, back to the Olympics and cleaning my place.
