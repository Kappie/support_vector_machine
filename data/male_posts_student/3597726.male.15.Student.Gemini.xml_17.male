I'll post more tomorrow when I have time.   Anyway, I can't wait till Dan and the Essigs get back from Springfield, OH. Ther coming backk tomorrow! yay! I really miss all of them. I think I'm gonna call Dan at like 5am tomorrow and wish him a happy July 4th. Thats going to be cool. Maybe it'll make the others laugh.   We saw fireowrks across from the Geneva football stadium. They weren't bad, just short. 12 minutes long!  My dad and I tried to get the vbs sign up for our church, but could find the right kind of stakes.   Oh, yeah. I changed my email address today... strong_bad531@hotmail.com yeah, I know. Awsome, isn't it. jk.  Gonna read, write, and crash. Catch ya'll...  I CAN'T WAIT TILL MY BRO GETS BACK WITH THE ESSIGS!
