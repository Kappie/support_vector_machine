Nonetheless, this is the most I'm inspired to write this morning, and all my sleep really didn't make me any more eager to study for my exam tomorrow.  Ah, well, I'll just force myself and 27 hours from now when the exam's over I can do something more fun like start my reading for next semester, or do my laundry, or clean my toilet.  Actually, maybe studying doesn't sound that bad.
