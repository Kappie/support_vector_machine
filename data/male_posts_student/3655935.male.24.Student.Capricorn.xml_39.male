The current so-called "Dream Team" got trounced by Puerto Rico,  urlLink 92-73 .  That's ugly.  They lost the lead before halftime and never regained it.  This means they didn't lose by some technicality or a fluke moment in the fourth quarter.  The other team just beat them in a bad way.  Why is this so?  I share some of the sentiments of  urlLink Bill Simmons , who suggests that we didn't pick the best roster for this year's team.  I think there's also something to be said about the current state of the NBA.  While there are some outstanding players like Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady, there still isn't that same immortal essence that one associates with Jordan, Bird, and Magic.  Even while they were still playing they achieved this demigod status.  I wish the current US olympic basketball team the best, and I would watch them if I had a tv.  But they aren't a  Dream Team .  Lately, they've shown they are the   Creamed Team  .  (I know it was cheesy, but I couldn't think of a better way to end this post.)
