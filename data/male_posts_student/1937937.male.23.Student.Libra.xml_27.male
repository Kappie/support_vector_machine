What would be the cost to each person in the United States? They don't give me any information on this one, so I'm going to have to get the details myself.  The total area of the United States is 3,537,441 mi 2   urlLink [source]  The population of the United States is 293,293,385 people  urlLink [US Census Bureau (this is pretty cool!  Real time population)]  A dollar bill is 6in x 2.5in = 15in 2   urlLink [source]
