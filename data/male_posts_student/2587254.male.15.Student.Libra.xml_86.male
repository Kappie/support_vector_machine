Today I gotta have a cheesy summary style blog. But it was a late start day today which was cool ^_^. Slept in whoo! And here's the day:  -Woke up -Lift to school from Pat -History....learned about Battle of the Atlantic (my comp froze, destroying my note....crap school comps =@) -Civics........did stuff w/ politics. We were grouped into parties and then voted (NDP won somehow, I was Liberal and voted Liberal) -Lunch....worked on programming project -Math: Review for dreaded test on Thursday -Programming: We did more imaging crap w/ Turing. So lame. -Bused home -Ate food -SC -Ate Dinner -Homework -TV -More homework  And now.......SLEEP! So yeah I'll make a better entry tomorrow. Later =P.
