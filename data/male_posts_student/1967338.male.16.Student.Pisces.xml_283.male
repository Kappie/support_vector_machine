I noticed interesting metaphors for other stories, but it was still very odd.  I liked it anyway.  Work sessions make me tired.  Of course, Im one of 2 or 3 that actually works the entire time, so hey, what did I expect?  I HATE MY ART PROJECT! GROUP PROJECTS+ART=DOOM HOUSE!  Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
