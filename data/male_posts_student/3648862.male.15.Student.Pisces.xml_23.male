Yuki and Shuichi kiss and its so beautiful. *cries* Oh yeah, I'm finally in NC. Its really hot here, but that's ok because I'm inside at the computer all day. I have a cable modem here, so I download as much anime as possible.   I'm really starting to miss Ryan, even though its been less than a week since I've seen him. I missed him so much I changed my profile picture to Shinji to remind me of him. I think I will write up a yaoi story involving me and him. Then I will get someone to draw it and I will have my own manga. Ryan didn't get on the net at all today. Hopefully he will be on tomorrow so I can talk to him for the first time since I confessed my love for him.   Today I went swimming, but it didn't cool me down much because the water was really warm. But I had fun never the less. I also rented some DVD's; one is scary movie 3. It was very funny, I give it a 7 out of 10. Oh god what's wrong with me, now I'm reviewing movies on my blog. I also rented a game for PS2, I got 13. I'm on the third level now, and the game is really fun. Oh crap, now I'm reviewing games, what's next food.   I think I going to go D/L some more gravitation, so I will TTYL.
