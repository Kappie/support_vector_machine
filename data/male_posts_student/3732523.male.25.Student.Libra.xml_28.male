I guess all I have to do now is find stuff to write about - without boring you all to death...  Last week I called my 'money guy' to see if I could cash in some of my RRSP's and growth funds so that I could have some money to play with. I'm moving next month and need the extra cash to set up stuff and to get a phone line installed... yadda yadda. Today I got a call from this guys secretary. She wants me to write a letter to them asking for "Full surrender of the policy" I've never done anything like this before and had no idea what to write. So I kept it nice and simple. Hopefully I'll have the money soon so I can start planning the move - renting the truck, getting boxes etc.   I went and looked at a basement suite yesterday. It's so much better then the apartment I'm living in now. This new place has a new kitchen, new bathroom, comes with a  piano  (whee!) and has a cool security system. The only bad thing about it is that the bedroom is super small - so what I would end up doing is giving my couch and bed to my sister, and buy a hideabed, then use the bedroom as a computer room/study area. Which wouldn't be too bad :) Its close to the university I'm going to, which is the main selling point. After looking at the place, I explored the neighbourhood a bit - I'm close to the skytrain, a lake, a park and the grocery store. I really hope I get this place!
