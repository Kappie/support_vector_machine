He loves God, golf, and women…but probably not in that order!  Every day, I go to his assisted living facility, pick him up, and take him to the golf course.  Before I met Frank, I had never even been to a golf course, much less ever played.  However, thanks to Frank I am now a not-too-horrible novice who is too cheap to ever make this a habit!  Frank is an item for discussion because of what he is teaching me about being a living, breathing, remembering, human being.  Since this website is dedicated to exploring theological thought, I decided it would be good for my first real entry to pause and be thankful for the mind each of us have.  I didn’t know Frank’s medical diagnosis when I first started working with him.  However, I began very quickly to suspect Alzheimer’s.  The true defining moment in my work with him came when I took him to see his specialist.  (Since Frank was never married, his only surviving family is his sister who lives three hours away…therefore, I took care of taking him to doctors, and I would then report to his sister about what the doctors said.)  As we were sitting with the doctor, I hoped that the doctor understood how much memory problems Frank had been having.  I worried because Frank was saying things like, “Everybody forgets things now and then.  Its just part of being old.”  I was worried the doctor didn’t even know that Frank had a problem.  But, I was wrong.  The doctor, whose professionalism I can’t even begin to recreate here, proceeded to remind Frank what he actually already knew…that he had Early-Middle Stage Alzheimer’s.  The doctor then proceeded to explain the treatment options available.  After he finished, Frank said, “Well it doesn’t really matter because I’m not going to be around much longer anyway…I’m pretty old.”  The doctor then said that we all need to make the best of whatever time we have left, and then he asked, “Frank, you said you’re old…how old are you?”  Frank stumbled for several seconds and then said, “You know I have a hard time remembering…let’s see I was born in 1923…”  “That’s right,” the doctor said encouragingly, “so how old does that make you?”  There was a long pause, and the doctor finally broke in and said, “What year is it, Frank?”  Frank responded, “You know, I have a hard time remembering that.  I’m just not quite sure how old I am.”  “Well,” said the doctor, “how old do you think you are?  Just guess.”  “Umm, I think I’m about 67,” Frank said incorrectly.  At that point, sitting across the room from Frank, I fought back tears.  Frank’s loss of memory was robbing him of self-identity.  I realized afresh the fragility of this life, and even more, the fragility of the mind.  I am a bit of an intellectual.  I enjoy thinking, rationalizing, problem solving, and learning.  This is a gift.  Often, we let our ability to think be an instrument of division.  We theorize reasons why this person or that person is not correct like we think we are.  Or, we drum up a platform that is superior to others’ ideas about what is best for our church, country, or whatever.  What’s even worse, I do this as badly as the next gal.  :)  I grew up being taught how to do this by my church, my school, my society, my political party, by everyone.  Frank taught me something that day.  He taught me to cherish every moment and every thought and every memory.  Our ability to think should not primarily be used as a weapon, but rather it should be used as a way to bless the lives of others.  There are no guarantees in this life (except death and taxes, I know), and we must remember to savor our days, our friends, even our enemies, and know that each thought is a gift.  Hopefully, my theological meandering on this site will never lose sight of this lesson.
