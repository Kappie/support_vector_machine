Anyway, contact lens insertion time is still 15 minutes but I kept them in for over 5 hours today - I'm going to try for 7 or 8 tomorrow... and I'm supposed to build up gradually apparently... oh well!  Finally I would like to urge anyone working in a Saturday job, a temporary job, or in actual fact, any job to quit as I still can't find myself a job and that would create more vacancies for me to try for.
