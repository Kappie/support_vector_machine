Anyway, overslept today and missed the copa final, but just for ur info, brazil won on penalties. Went to school, nothing much happen also, today not much lessons la, only kena kp by the geog teacher again, don know why, but theynag and nag and nag, the stress sucks. Then hav to write some lame form for achievements not recognised by school, and of course i got nothing to write about, even if recognised by school i also cannot guarantee got things to write. I mian qiang write a few small achievements down lor. After school went home, then slack, bought some stationary, did my homework, then came online. Listening to jay new song now, qi li xiang. Absolutely rocks, i just wonder how ppl can be so creative, composing and writing endless songs, and it just keeps getting better. Anyway, today is a day for celebration, we got exactly 100 days left to Os, yes...100. Mug as hard as you can now, cause armagedon is coming...
