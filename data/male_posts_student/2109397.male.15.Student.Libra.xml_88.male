Last year I wasnt exposed to GK training and the kind of stuff they do there. And also this year we did a little bit less than last. I got good ratings on my evaluation which pleased me. In the PK shootout however Derek was a fucking faggot and made me retake my PK then saving it. Fuck him. For the finals it was this one little kid versus a kid from Nelson County. Patrick picked some little kid to play goal for the other little kid and for some reason he made me play goal for the Nelson County kid. Turns out this Nelson County kid is the same one who missed a PK against me in our last game of the season. So I pick the direction I am going. I fake to the other way and then move to that side. Well he hit it the other way (against my guess) but he nailed the post. So now the kid has missed 2 PKs against me...I like to think its becuase I'm just so intimidating.  I have a huge ass bruise/knot on my hip and it hurts like a bitch.
