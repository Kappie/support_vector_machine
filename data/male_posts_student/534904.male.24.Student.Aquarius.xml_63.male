From the back of the CD:   The greatest road to advancement is through pain. Physically and emotionally, Tool demonstrate this through music that is more than just typical head-banging power chords.  The String Tribute to Tool: Third Eye Open  delivers the band's solemn and sinister message through string instruments that can be warm and welcoming at one moment, cold and distant at the another. Materly performed by some of today's hottest string players, this album offers a totally new interpretation of the musical mastermind that is Tool.   The premise for this album is to take Tool songs and arrange them (more or less faithfully) for a string ensemble, thus presenting the familiar songs in a new light. The ten tracks on this CD are: 1) Sober   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   2) Intolerance   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   3) The Grudge   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   4) The Patient  (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   5) Opiate   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   6) Hush   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   7) Schism   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   8) Ticks and Leeches   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   9) Aenema   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   10) Pushit   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   Overall, the songs are well arranged, but the thing that really,  really  bugs me is that two people arranged half the songs each. One of whom is a much,  much  better arranger than the other, so some of the songs (1, 2, 6, 9, 10) sound utterly fantastic, while the others are just "good." I don't know why they chose to do this; probably to reduce their workload, I assume.. but it just sticks out like a sore thumb to me. I don't know if it will to anybody without much musical training though, but them's the breaks. I was disappointed that favorite songs like Ticks and Leeches and The Patient were let down by a sub-par arrangement, but I was very glad that Pushit and Sober weren't :)  I give it an 8/10 - worth a listen, even if you're not into Tool (HEATHEN!) or Classical music (ditto) :D   urlLink Sober
