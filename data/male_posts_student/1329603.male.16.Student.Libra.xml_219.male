The Of Mice and Men qu... oh, excuse me, the ' Of Mice and Men ' question was very cool and easy to write about (3 pages!!), but the poetry ones left a little to be desired. What they left to be desired were good questions.  Oh, and I'm thinking about lobbying to get NJaN a name change... dunno, I'll put that out in the open to readers - What do you think about Not Just a Number as a name?  One last thing, I think the Telegraph or someone should make a blog that tells you the news. That'd be an original idea. Oh, oh, and they could put pictures in, give it subcategories, and sell it for 60 pence at newsagents across the count...ry...  Quote of the day: "How can I forgive you, never leave you, You know that if you live like, you will die like, How can I erase your pain and take you, When death wants to kiss you, and you want to kiss him back?"  From Sonata Arctica's   Sing in Silence   Love, Jon Roskilly
