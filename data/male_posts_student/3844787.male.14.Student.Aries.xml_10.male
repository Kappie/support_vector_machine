Instead of wallpapers on the links page, i've replaced it with a link directly too this weblog, as I feel that people knowing things is more relevant than something I made in Photoshop in 5 Minutes! I'd rather express how I feel through texts rather than some abstract form of digital photos!  I think that this is all I need to say, so I'll post back in here tomorrow! Until then Peace out
