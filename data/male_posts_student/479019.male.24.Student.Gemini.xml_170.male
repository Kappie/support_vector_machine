They probably didn't want to be redundant. They debuted some new stuff, which sounds really good. It's got a harder sound than their more recent stuff. I like that because it's less emo or pop punk. Not that, that stuff is horrible, but it's just my musical tastes. They kept repeating that they've been around for 5 years. It's hard to belive that.... I remember hearing about them 4 years ago as a freshman in college... the set was good and the crowd was full of energy despite the hot venue. I just think that they could have been a bit more organized, but I guess they just didn't want a complete repeat of the earlier show.  ***
