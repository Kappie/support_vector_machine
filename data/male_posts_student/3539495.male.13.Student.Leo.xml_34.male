Sure they have everything about gaming and stuff that you really don't need to know, but now they have to suck one of the most prestigous tech channels, techTV, into their grips. They've stripped the channel of their best shows, ie Call For Help (Call For Help was by far the best show that techTV had ever aired and Leo was the man. Check out his blog  urlLink here ), taken down all the archives of the channel, and refuse to air new episodes of the shows that were on the original techTV. Geez, this makes me mad. And seriously, who wants to watch Girls Gone Wired? G4's turned techTV into something else entirely.
