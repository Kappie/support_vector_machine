I am in a sweating frenzy that only ebay bidding can lure me into. Seriously, I am fucking  addicted . Since my beloved polaroid camera came in the post early friday morning, I have been telling anyone and everyone who'll listen that yes, ebay really is "that easy!" Ahh, I do believe I sound like a phony advert. The only trouble with my fab £5.50 trendy, in vouge, retro camera is the film. £12 for 10 shots! Gulp - but mneh, the photos are fantastic, as you devoted readers will see when I figure how to publish the freaking things on the blog.      Today me and Naomi went into town. Ahh, swoon, holding hands like an old-married-couple in the manner of Julaaar and Dan rocks. Anyway we saw many people from school, and each time I swelled with pride at them seeing Naomi with me :D. But before this afternoon, everything was truly shit. Federico and Riccardo left today, and I won't see them for like, 15 months?! Or something, which isn't a big deal or owt, just a bummer :(. And Kate has got a  lot  of explaining to do, after all my careful planning to organise a  cheer-up-chook  night out. Grr am in a right ole' pissy with ya Kate, and no denying it.       grr. Weather. Yay! ebay! (have just found I am the highest bidder for "The Beach" soundtrack and "Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood" soundtrack! Does anyone else find ebay makes you buy totally random, often crap things?      Sam      Currently listening to: Less Than Jake - Anthem. Great album...
