After doing a bit of homework yesterday, I spent pretty much from 13:00 until I went to bed on the computer. Probably about 6 hours in all, the occasional stop for dinner and a look through the revision guide. Finally coming to my senses at about 20:00, I felt my eyes tired and aching, head was hurting... argh, it was horrible. I don't want to repeat that again in a hurry. A lot of the time was spent on neopets (yes, I know, it is a 12 year old girl's game) on the chat boards, discussing the existence of ghosts and demons. No doubt you can guess my stance immediately. (If you can't guess, I was dead [no pun intended] against the idea). They suggested I take a look at  urlLink this website . It contains photos of ghosts, which somehow managed to convince too many people of the existence of ghosts. Can't think why, the pictures are absolutely terrible. (I would post pictures from the site here, but I don't know how to yet. Using the [IMG]  and [/IMG] tags didn't seem to work.) Not very convincing eh? The discussion/flat out argument went on with me saying how pictures such as this could easily be made on simple photo-editing software, or specks of dust and water on the camera lense, or creases in the film or something. It's amazing how gullible some people are...  Anyway, back to the original topic of me needing a hobby... I don't really want it to involve a computer, as I spend way too much time on the computer already. I don't really like meeting new people, or playing sports, which rules out quite a few activities. Maybe something inside... chess maybe. Or reading. But I can do those already, I have a nearby library, aswell as a chess computer, but I don't. I was looking browsing  urlLink How Stuff Works  yesterday and came across an article on ham radio, which could be quite interesting. Apparently people all over the world communicate on these hand-held radio things, quite ingenious really, although I could get a mobile phone, which would do the job much better. But then where's the fun with a phone when you can use ham radio? But you need to get a license and pass a test, which kind of spoils the fun. Well, whatever my hobby turns out to be, it will have to wait until after the exams. Bye for now.   Playing:  Played 'Tetris' on the Gameboy last night, fairly good.  Listening To:  'Brave Sir Robin Ran Away'. Great song.   Watching:  old episode of 'Friends' this morning.  Annoyed With:  Those fools who believe in ghosts  Confused About:  Nothing really, maybe the business test I've just done.  Mood:  Fine
