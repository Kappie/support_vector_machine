Even Troy and Lord of the Rings: The return of the King can match up with it. A truely touching film,  it left me  pondering and thinking of the film on the couch. When Maximus fell, poisoned and exhausted to his feet on the hot sandy ground, my eyes were teeming with tears. As Lucilla shouted the few words to the public, after his death, " Is one good man's life worthy of Rome?"  An eclectic mixture of  military conquest and gladiatorial  combats,  Gladiator never fails to  excite me.  The show starts in a the frontlines of the boundaries of the Roman empire with the Roman legionaries and auxilaries formed up before a dark forest.  A headless corpse comes galloping on a horse towards the general, as a germanic barbarian storms out of the forest and flings the head of the soldier at the Romans. They chant their war cries, as the Roman army readies  itself.  In a few moments, ignited arrows and fiery fireballs rain upon the barbaric hordes breaking the lines of barbarians. The legionaries march forth and locking their shields from the desperate efforts of the barbarian arrows, and advancing closer towards them.  Close by, a legion of cataphracts storm towards the back of the Germans with Maximus in the lead. He tramples past the  enemy and slashes and strikes down at his foe. The Roman legions reign victorious and they cheer and honour Maximus for their decisive victory.  But sadly, Commodus murdered his father, whom regarded Maximus highly. This caused  the loss of Maximus' family and the capture of him.  But Maximus' was skilled, and easily laid waste to the praetorian guards out to execute him.  After learning of his family's death,  Maximus laid before their graves in anguish and was discovered and sold to a slave merchant.  From that time onwards, he became a gladiator and fought for his freedom.  Spurred by Proximus' words," Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom", Maximus went on to annihilate more of his victims. Death was swift, when Maximus wielded his sword, slashing his enemies to death and winning the support of the crowd.  His victories led him to Rome, and from there he entered the magnificent Colosseum right in the heart of Rome.  He met his enemy, Commodus,  and defied his orders.  Salutation was met with a cold hard stare and he turned his back on the Emperor, whom ordered him to remove his mask. Maximus turned around, and at a slow pace,  removed his mask and gazed vengefully at the Emperor.  "I am   Maximus Decimus Meridius, loyal subject to the one true emperor Marcus Aurelius,  Commander of the Northern Armies,  father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance."  After a few victories at the Colosseum and a conspiracy which failed, due  to the cunninest of  Commodus, the emperor challenged Maximus to arena, but with the disparity of a poisoned blade stabbed into Maximus' side. Those words of pure evilness still remained in my mind when Commodus spoke to him before the battle, in a slow and menacing tone," I heard from my men, that your son squealed like a girl when he was nailed to the cross  and your wife moaned like a whore...when they ravaged her again and again, and again...   " The  taunting sentence of Commodus' last words utterly enraged Maximus.  The colosseum was littered with red petals  of roses upon the sandy ground, as the final battle emerged from beneath. A platform, shielded by the praetorian guards, rose from the undergrounds into the arena. Maximus started drifting off into a reverie, as he caught the last glimpses of sunlight.  He seemed to travel back to his small villa, and felt the whistle of the wind against his body, the touch of the wheat plants brushing against his hands. And there it was, the door to it.  As he started up for it, a sudden glisten of the sword shiny before him,  broke him from his reverie as he blocked it and thrust his sword forth in retaliation. The final battle had begun, and his last foe to kill.  Commodus was eventually killed by his own dagger, after having his sword knocked from his arms and receiving defiance from his praetorian guards, whom had at that moment pledged allegiance to Maximus.  In a last slow stab, Maximus forced the dagger into his throat,  leaving Commodus spewing blood from his mouth.  A masterful movie, an absolute tour de force, touching me deep in my heart, and impressing my throughly with it's spectacular scenarios and the remaking of the ancient city of Rome. A much worthwhile  film than the Matrix, with it's sci-fi, but never beating the cool moves of Russell Crowe.  Never had a seen such a beautifully made movie, and understood with such great dept too. Up till now, the chantings of the crowd in anticipation for the Gladiator who defied an emperor,  remained in my mind, "Maximvs! Maximvs! MAximvs!"
