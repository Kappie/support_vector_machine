A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger-Proverbs:15 Verse:1 Remember...don't be too tough or gentle for someone...leave enough space for him or her to experience consequential learning...being too soft will cause him/her to be too dependant. being too tough will cause him/her to think that you are neglecting their feelings...balance it well... Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out-Proverbs 17 Verse 14...i hope everyone understands all this and make the world a better place...-OySt3r
