I read on a website,  urlLink a website , that they're going to do a parody of Joe Millionaire.  If I was writing a law-school-related parody of Joe Millionaire... [dream sequence music, please]  [Lights up on a beach filled with female law students.  And one man.  Not a handsome man.  Not a rich man.  Not a charming man.  But a man with a handful of paper.]  MAN: I'm Joe Final-Exam-Answers.  And I have the answers to your final exams.  GIRL 1: Ooh!  Joe Final-Exam-Answers!  I love you!  GIRL 2: I've always dreamed of being with a guy... who had the exam answers.  Joe, I can fulfill your every fantasy... if you can tell me how to test for personal jurisdiction.  GIRL 3: Joe, I'm a model.  And you have the model answers.  It's fate.  Fate, I tell ya.  Now tell me all about Hanna v. Plumer and how I can test the validity of a Federal Rule... and I'll make a brand new Federal Rule just for you, Joe...  [Another man enters, holding some more papers.]  MAN 2: I'm Joe Offer-Letter-for-Summer-Internship-at-Cravath.  And I have a contract here that will pay you... twenty-five hundred dollars a week.  [A stagehand whispers something in his ear.]  Oh, we just got the Enron account.  Three thousand dollars per week!  [The girls all run to the new Joe.  Joe Final-Exam-Answers is sad.]  GIRL 1: I've always wanted to give myself to a guy... with an offer letter for a summer internship at Cravath.  I'll make you stay up all night long... and not because you're Shepardizing cases.  In fact, I'll let you Shepardize *my* case, if you know what I mean.  GIRL 2: You have offer letters for summer internships at Cravath... and I'm not wearing any clothes.  It's fate, I tell ya!  It's fate!  MAN 1: But I thought you all wanted me!  Me!  Joe Final-Exam-Answers!  [Blackout.]  [And, yeah, I know I need an ending...]
