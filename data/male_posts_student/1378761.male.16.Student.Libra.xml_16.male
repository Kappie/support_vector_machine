So today I updated the site a little by adding the Ericville gazette. MSNBC doesn't stream news anymore so I have to update it my self. I also put in school delays and closings. I am getting ready to put in some articles under the school section.   This weekend I went snowmobiling in Michigan with my dad and his friend. It was soo much fun. The trails are very nice and the woods looks beautiful with the snow in the trees.  I wanted to go riding around here today but I didn't. I also wanted to finish putting in the car started but I also didn't.  I am just lazy.  Well I don't have much more to say. It would make my friend Alyssa Ahlers A.K.A. "Snow Angle" to say her name on here. Hello Snow Angle (Long story behind that -> will talk about soon) and a hello goes out to her sister Natalie.  until the next blue moon, **ERIC**
