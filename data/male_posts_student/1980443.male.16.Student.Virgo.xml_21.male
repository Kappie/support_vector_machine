She came all the way from Cedarville (a good 3 1/2 hour drive or more) to see me play my last home game this weekend.  It was a huge suprise, I didn't even see her until I got done w/part of warm-ups.  She rocks, and she knows it.   She laughs at all my dumb jokes, and always takes my side w/the parental feuds.  I love you, rach.  Keep it real, I'm Will
