Any suggestions? Never mind, I appear to have  figured  it  urlLink out   Anyhoo, I had to miss my composition lesson today - I woke up at 2pm with a bastard of a migraine.. my lesson is at 3pm, so I had an hour to make up several pages of .PDF files, MIDI recordings, burn a CD with it all on there, take a shower, ride to uni, print the afore-mentioned .PDF files on the uni computers (and hope that the printer doesn't go haywire again) and have breakfast. Seeing as it takes 20 minutes to get to uni without riding extremely dangerously, I could see taht it asn't going to happen. Especially not with a motherfucking migraine.
