So, today's site of the day is IGN, one of the biggest freakin' media sites on the internet today.  IGN stands for Imagine Games Network, but, they're not games anymore...they're games, movies, TV, music, and pretty much everything that the media has to offer today.  It offers a lot of user interaction, including the feature where you can post your game collection, and all sorts of stuff.  It's awesome, but, IGN may have its problems.  IGN has some of the best reviews for games.  Everytime someone reviews a videogame, and people don't agree with the review, they go to IGN to get the real scoop.  They have talented editors who take time and effort into producing quality news, reviews, and more.  The site design looks nice, and the whole thing looks professional, and that is what I like most about it.  If you want to take advantages of features like creating your own game collection, you have to sign up.  It's easy, its free (if you want a basic membership, that is), and it's worth it.  You can post your whole game collection, give them little reviews, and create a wishlist for games that you're looking forward to.  They also tell you how much your collection is worth.  You can write up reader reviews, and do all sorts of stuff.  It's really unique, and it's so easy to do.  IGN is one of the best gaming sites, hands down.  Check back for tomorrow's site of the day, because we're going to check out another, called GameSpot.      Pros  +Create a game collection, wishlist, and reader reviews +Covers more than just games, including movies, music, etc. +Owns a lot of big sites, like GameFAQs, Rotten Tomatoes, and GameSpy.   Cons  -People on the message boards are stupid.
