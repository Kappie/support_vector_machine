These pictures are from immediately after the ceremony and include many from Denison.     urlLink    Here they are again, this time posing for somebody else's picture.     urlLink    Katie with her mother.     urlLink    Some people don't like their pictures taken...     urlLink    But I got her this time.  Nancy, Rachel, and Hydy.     urlLink    Sarah and Debbie     urlLink    And here she is again!  The little shutterbug...     urlLink    Just two seconds too late... Here are Lisa and Sarah.     urlLink    Sarah again, tripod provided by Nancy.     urlLink    The Best Cake Ever.     urlLink    Debbie, Rob, and Sage (and a dozen other people) throw around the ol' disc.     urlLink    A bit of clever cropping, and you can hardly tell we have no idea where the camera is aimed.     urlLink    What?  What's this?  Someone's been sitting in my tonka toy, and here she is! urlLink
