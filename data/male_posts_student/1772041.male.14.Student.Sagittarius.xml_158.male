When i came back, that someone dissapeared. so i went to music room cause she's there doing choir, so i waited outside. But she didn't turn up.... for some reason.... anyway, i was using Jia Weii to see if she's in choir room. Hahahahhaha!!! So yea, i didn't go for VB programming either. Was waiting for her. But couldn't talk to her at all. Nvm lah, but i can't afford to skip another VB programming... Maybe i will next week. Don't know lah! G2g guys, ciao ppl
