I just want to do one simple thing, but it ends up I have to do like 30 other things for that 1 thing to work.....anyway... I feel like putting an advertisement for my favorite game of all time, Tibia! Its a online RPG (MMORPG) and its great. I'll put a link to some screenshots later if I remember, but for now go to :  urlLink Tibia.com  to get information, YOU CANT give up the oppurtunity to check out this GREAT, FREE game!!!
