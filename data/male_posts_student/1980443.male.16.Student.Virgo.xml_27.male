Ms. Barbic, I'm not sure if she means like a spiritual thing or like something physical like.... uh ... weight.  I'm not putting off weight anymore so, that's taken care of.  I guess I'm putting off laziness, my grades have suffered this year and it's all thanks to laziness.  I know that I procrastinate alot, but sometimes I procrastinate to take care of my procrastination!?! Isn't that hard to believe!  Sometimes with all this business the best thing I can do sometimes is to sit down and watch tv.  At least, that's what I do alot when I am just being lazy.  I know that this is something I need to work on and am.  Thanks homies.  This girl walked up to me the other day and was like uhhhhh, and I was like WHATEVER! Then this other girl walked up to me and was like uhhh, then I like yeah whatever! The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
