But, Lyle Canyon is an very easy trail (or at least the first part before the pass) and it should go relatively smoothly. We're (my parents and I) just going to hike a few miles in, stay at a nice campsite a couple nights, and hike back.   To accompany me in this new trip is a new backpack, the Osprey Aether 75- a sweet pack that totally redefines the word "ergonomic". Also, I finally get my own single-person tent (not the $250 tactical one I wanted from TADgear), which means I can finally sleep alone and uncramped, and have a little privacy to myself.
