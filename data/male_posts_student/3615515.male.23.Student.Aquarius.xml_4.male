He was pretty surprised seeing me drink comfortably because he has been trying to make me drink for a year now and I never gave in. I started drinking only in the summers. Its not that I am particularly fond of alcohol, just that now I'm pretty comfortable with drinking.   The night we drank together for the first time, we stayed awake almost all night chatting. A night out was due anyway since we had met after such a long time. Sometime around the morning, he told me that now that I've started drinking, I should take care that I dont make a habit of it. He said that these things start while having fun with friends but might develop into habits, if not kept within control. It was as if an elder brother (he's actually three months younger to me but ya... he's more experienced when it comes to drinking) was giving me advice, taking care that I dont go down the wrong path. All my life, I've been the elder brother to Aditya, and sometimes even Rahul, explaining to them what I think is right or wrong. It was quite a different feeling being on the other side. I actually liked it that someone was explaining to me what he thought was right for me (Of course, parents always take up that role when needed but its quite different when someone in your age group does it).
