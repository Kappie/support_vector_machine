Here is how I matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   High       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Very High       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Low       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very High       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Moderate       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Low      Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test    Hmmm... i suppose that this is bad. I guess this kinda shows a breakdown of my underlying psyche. Only moderately violent... hmm.. ok. Take it.. it's fun. If you're religious I don't think it's possible to get below level 5. Give it a shot.  Oh who the hell am I kidding.. Go for it adil.
