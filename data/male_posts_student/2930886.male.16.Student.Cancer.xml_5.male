Track in the rain, I keep trying to talk to Rachel but alas, nerd like me can't have someone like that, plus on top of being a senior and a good looking one I believe her mentioning something about a boy friend I hope not. Well there's Carlie, a junior, still out of my league because she's a genius, 2nd in her class, but I don't think that she had a boy friend, but then again she probably wont be interested in me.  There's Jane a freshman that likes me, I think I stand a better chance with Meghan, still another year with her ill see how that turns out. And I'm thinking about how I would do trying to write a novel in month for nanowritemonth, at least I think I will be able to beat holtz. There is always the girl from polish but she is to good looking and on top of it I think she lives in like amity or something like that. Who am I a such a fucking prude?  As the French say Je ne sais pas. I don't know I will have time for a longer update sometime later.
