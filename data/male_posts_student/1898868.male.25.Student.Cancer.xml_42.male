Josh and I are setting up this forum, "The Random Bird" so that we can all keep in touch, let everyone know what we're up to without flooding everyone's E-mail inbox, and just generally post whatever it is that goes on in those heads of ours.  Please post early and often!  The Blogger software is easy and intuitive to use, so have a blast!  Please feel free to share this address with whomever you think would be interested... Josh and I will be able to add users as well, in case anyone inadvertantly got left out.    And since this is the Internet, the rules are: be nice.     .joel
