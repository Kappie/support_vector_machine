Suzanne and ou xuan a day keeps the doctor away, yes! lol  Switch on to chn5 in the morning and found out that copa america starts today, but, no time to watch, coz i will be slogging away, teaching kids to be good, like me. LOL    Today had raisin bread for breakfast, no more "Sor Ta Pia" YES! Haha, took mrt to work today again, now i finally agree it took much lesser time than 147, ok i love MRT now! Haha.     YESSSSSS............... NOOOOOOO.....   Same old story, most of the P4 kids did not do the presentation they supposed to prepare, oh well... But took a P5 EM1 class today, their presentations are almost perfect! POWER SIA! All points included, confident speeches.. They are THAT good..  Theres tis group from P5, only the leader was writing up the whole presentation, this poor girl, Alivia, was slogging away with the presentation scripts, while the boys were playing stupid games.. I gathered the boys and gave them a good scolding, i told them tat their parents was working hard to pay for this business course that they are attending, and they only know how to play a fool during class.. Some kids are not as fortunate as them to be able to afford this course.. And the next thing i knew, they went back playing more stupid games, and Alivia was writing and writing, dont they listen! But we told them off after class, saying that tis is about team work, not only the leader doing everyting.. but i dont think they will change, sad to say...   After work, my colleague told me, that the teacher who is in charge of the P4 level, filed a complaint about us, insisting that we did not do a proper job, thats why the P4 kids did not do their presentations. Although i just started on the job this week, my colleague told me that he had already mentioned it to the kids last week, and i trust him, the teacher is making a big fuss.. Have to go for tis meeting with her tomolo, haiz.. Complain complain..  Read the news on manutd.com, rooney is set to snub a new Everton 5-yr deal worth Â£50,000 a week. And man united might launch a bid for the england star, ok man united can launch all they wan, but dont sell Van Nistelrooy to get funds for Rooney, anyting but that!  My friend found Suzanne Jung's picture! YEA BABY! Actually i've tried searching for her pic, but then i found an ang moh old lady with the name suzanne jung, and i was like "......"    The Suzanne Jung imposter...    The REAL Suzanne Jung  Just discovered today that some singaporeans are just not considerate at all, yesterday nobody wanted to let his/her seat up for a pregnant lady, and tis Bitch was leaning on to the pole near the pregnant lady, and there she is, standing in a squeezy mrt without support.. And tis bastard today, lean on to the pole too and a lot of people dont get to grab on to the pole for support. Whats with this leaning on the pole thing nowadays, why dont these bastards and bitches, learn how to pole dance and entertain the passengers, since they like the poles so much. (Excuse the language)   Oh well, tomolo another day of work. And the meeting with the teacher, wooo, its giving me the jitters, hope i will see a rainbow tomolo and not dark clouds!     Carebears SHAREEEEE! (or is it care? hmmz) LOL  Current Mood: Disappointed Current Music: Sun Yan Zi - Sometimes love just aint enough
