The girl who I still can't get out of my head is going out with my friend tomorrow, so I'll have to find out how that goes. I've also developed an incurable liking for songs like "She's the one" (by Robbie Williams coincidentally) and have started to notice the words in them, and just how true they are. I'm suck a sucker for love!  E3 is also upon us; the yearly violent ejaculation of gaming news, previews, screenshots, movies and who knows what else. It's all too much and the information overload makes it hard to find out anything. Looking around on Gamespot, there's just so much going on, too many movies to watch and news stories to read. You could be there all night digesting it.  And talking of digesting, food is going to be on the table in a minute, so I must be off!
