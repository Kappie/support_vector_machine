Well I have gone to see movies in the last little while such as Dodgeball which is reall funny and stars Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn. I would reccomend that you give this movie a watching because it is really good! Also a movie that I seen last night was Spiderman 2. This is another great movie that I would reccomend you go to see because it is great it far out do's the original movie. Well now that summer has set in the temperature has gone up and well I have became much more active I go out for walks now and I enjoy them. I call them aimless pointless walks becuase they have no point what so ever so that is why I call them that! Well that is about all I have to say for now until next time I get a chance to post.
