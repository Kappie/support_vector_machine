Why can it be mine? I want what they have  Flames of jealousy, Raging inside of me. Am I any worse than them?  Why instead of me to him? But he’s my friend, will be there to the end,  So I won’t hate, but I can’t stop this debate I shiver at the thought of what society’s wrought, wrought in me  But that’s not it. Now complete the fit.  It throbs and stings to lack abstract things To be left wanting, to have nothing while they have it all.  Oh, what gall I want to cry, too afraid to try, but I confess the hurt  Jealousy and anger, The root the hurt. Threefold wheel, so very real, Two strong to break, only one uptake;  I’m entrapped, my strength is sapped I’m quietly screaming, but I have no meaning.  I’m the plague, Society-made, So just stay away.  written 5/2/04
