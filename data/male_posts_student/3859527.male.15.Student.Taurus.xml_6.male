It's unfortunate, but all of us have to execute Damage Control at some point in our lives.  For the lucky, the damage is isolated, and the situation is under control within minutes.  But in some situations, the damage may seem irreparable.  Furthermore, once damage control is over, the source of the damage must be dealt with.  When the source is close to you, this might be terribly difficult, and might change your life, and I hate, no loathe change that is difficult.  I am currently trying to pinpoint the source of some recent damage for a friend, and we're both suspecting that the source is close to us.  And, well, you might say I'm scared of the change that'll ensue.  Let's just hope that the change isn't too difficult, and that is ends as well as a previous event did.
