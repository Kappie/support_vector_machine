I mean the fact that no matter what kind or how many arguments you bring forward, every person will still hold back to his/her own views/believes. I just wish people weren't so judgmental and close-minded, dividing the world into wrong or right, moral/immoral, good/bad. I personally believe that all of us have our own ten/twenty or however many commandments that we hold close to our hearts and which are precisely the reflections of our views on life based on our OWN individual experiences. That's the primary reason why I call myself "partially religious" and of course because I believe in God in my own special way... So therefore I invite you all to convert to Buddhism in order to experience the eternal happiness in the state of Nirvana... Long life to Allah.
