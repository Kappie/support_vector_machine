There is only one Butler in the Digitilia because Monggiton is still studying its structures. Believe it or not, the Butler has a name and it is called Popoy.   Popoy is an android that can express emotions and registers in its system what is right and what is wrong. This depends on the inputs of the instuctor in the Butler. He is like a personal assistant of the current instuctor in checking the cubickes if the sutdents are doing what they must do. He is like a real human only lacking the human organs and the ability to produce a fertile offspring.
