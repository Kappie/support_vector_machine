Shouldnt have went, but, had to run an errand. Spent 20 mins on a wild goose chase for the classroom key...den played a little bball. Ate a long johns...till 12...msged hui, but she didnt reply. O_o. Was a little late already, so i had nothing to do, just sit around to wait for her reply. haha i was damn sian, so i decided to call her to wake her up, but no answer too, so i went over, thinking that if i rang her doorbell i could pass the book over to her mum or bro or something. Thank god when i rang her house, she answered. DOH! Going out with family later, shopping. Doh, but hey, at least its better den staying at home?!
