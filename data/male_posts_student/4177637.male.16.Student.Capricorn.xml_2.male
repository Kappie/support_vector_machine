Soo, it's really slow and I can't really do anything more than "surf the web". Which is really such a dumb phrase if you think about it, surfing is done on water; furthermore, spiders don't surf on webs, they crawl... so, technically that's what it should be. Although that's pathetic too... how about "click-on-random-website-in-search-of-something-interesting-in-hopes-that-you-don't-hit-a-porn-site." Or do hit one. Depending on your preference.  Anyways, I tried to think of what people do on the internet who don't play games. So, first I went to get my daily horoscope (I'm certain this is done alot) even though I think horoscopes are the epitome of crap. But regardless, here's mine for today:   (Capricorn) - Turn off your cell phone, beeper, or anything else that might distract you from paying attention to one particular person. Every now and then, even your diligent sign gets to take an evening off.   Oook. Since my cell phone's already turned off - to save batteries - I'm wondering who I'm supposed to be paying attention to. I think I finally came to the original conclusion of "horoscopes are pieces of crap intended to waste your time". Yes. That's it. I win.
