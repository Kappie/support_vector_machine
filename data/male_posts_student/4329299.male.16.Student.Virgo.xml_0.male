(i still talk to my girlfriends that i have had in high school) my mom watches south park, lets me do whatever, as long as i dont do something stupid..... shes cool, but i think shes trying to make up for kip. i really got the bad end of kip. phillip, my brother, was into cars and bikes and stuff like that, so he got along with kip. lauren just stayed out of his way, then one day she fell off the roof when we were trying to fix it, so she became his little girl. i was the problem child, i liked video games, which were the devil, so i would sneek in a gameboy, which got found. i never really did well in school, so i was always in trouble for that..... kip was an asshole, so its ok, he can rot in hell for all i care.... anyway thats all for now, ill post some time today or tomorrow......
