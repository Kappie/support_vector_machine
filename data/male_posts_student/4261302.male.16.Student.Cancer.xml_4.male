First of all, when I came home from Jenny's house about 11:30, I had to go through the Frome valley walkway, a little strip of natural pathway that runs next to the river. For some reason, instead of being lit up by near houses and warehouses, it was PITCH BLACK. I really couldn't see my hand in front of my face. I know this because I had it stretched out in front of me to stop me bumping into trees, which I did anyway, despite them being inches from face. It was lucky that I knew the path well, or otherwise I'd still be out there. Secondly, no-one minded me coming home at midnight, which is very unusual. I'm used to search and rescue teams being sent out if I'm 5 minutes late home.  Thirdly,  I was woken up at 5 o'clock by wasps flying over my head. I suprised myself by going from full sleep to out my bedroom door in under 5 seconds. So, lacking in sleep and clothes, I pressed the faulty switch in my hall, instantly shocking myself. I will tell no-one of this. Apart from anyone who's reading this, but what the hell. So my day really wasn't set up, really. James helped by providing the idea of consuming huge amounts of sugar in various forms, which made me feel better. So, tired and spasming slightly from the after-effects of sugar, I am now typing this. Tomorrow is another day, and it will involve a water fight. I have convinced myself that I am not too old for such an activity, as I have kept my two pistols and my supersoaker 3000...anyway, it should be fun, as I have extensive knowledge of the area, whereas most of the participants have never been there before. Ah well, as long as the girls wear white tops on their team, everyone on the our side will be too busy staring to do anything, so it should even out. (Just for the record,that was a  joke.  I have no wish to be blamed for it later) Anyway, time to carry on with the website building. Still not getting anywhere. Caio.
