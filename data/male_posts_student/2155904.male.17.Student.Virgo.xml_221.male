Tyke is excited for leaving but he's also sad he won't see friends for a while.  This is his last hurrah.  Last night of course was the all-night senior graduation party (lots of adjectives there).  It was really quite a bit of fun.  And Tyke didn't hang out with the ladies much either.  Imagine that.  The first destination (after all of the waiting to leave) was Champs Karting in the Georgetown district of Seattle.  They had an indoor course for go-karts, a game room with DDR and stuff set up, a pool hall with other games, and then a casino.  Tyke played a lot of blackjack there.  Quite a lot actually.  Most of his 3 hours there was spent playing blackjack.  It was fun and Tyke didn't do too bad really.  It is pretty fun playing with a bunch of people for blackjack.  Especially since they made friends with the dealers.  Skippy, Dr. Phil, and Amed were living it up at the craps table.  They were playing there for a long time.  It's not that easy to win big though.  But Jew won tons at the roulette wheel.  He just kept doubling up.  After staying there for 3 hours everyone boarded up on the buses and Tyke and Dotti sat next to each other.  The next surprise stop was Seahawks Stadium where they went up to a suite and had two inflatable bouncy thingys and a dance floor and a place for Segway usage.  So that was fun.  Tyke got hurt some using the two inflatable bouncy thingys but they were really fun.  And they looked right over the field so when Stadium High School (that's who it was) was on the field it was pretty fun to watch.  Apparently time on the field costs a hell of a lot of money so that's why Issy didn't do it but Tyke doesn't mind, he might not have gone down for long anyway.  But it was fun hanging out there for a while.  At the end there was a hypnotist.  Now that was hilarious.  He had the volunteers doing lots of crazy things.  Tyke tried to volunteer but he didn't get picked so when he tried to do it on his own he couldn't focus cuz he had to go to the bathroom soooooooo bad.  It sucked.  He finally went and it was sooooooo refreshing.  But Tyke and Purdy really enjoyed the hypnotist and it was a great end to the night.  When they left there it was already light out and it was a little after 5 AM.  Tyke really was never tired, even when he got home at 6 in the morning.  He just went into bed and tried to fall asleep and boom he did.  He set his alarm for 3 PM and all of a sudden he heard his alarm go off and realized it was 3.  It came sooo quickly.  It was really nice though.  When Tyke got up he packed and got completely ready for Europe.  He managed to fully fit inside the small suitcase.  He did quite well to do so.  He isn't going to look as hot as he usually does but thats ok...he has nobody to impress there anyway.  But it will be fun.  At night Tyke called Tina, Purdy, Dotti, and Karla to see if they were free to hang out for a little just so Tyke could say goodbye in person.  Karla came over with Dudely and Stock and they had fun while they were there.  They said their goodbyes and then the rest of the guys were there and they played some games.  Tyke got to say goodbye to Skippy, Dr. Phil, Kinker, K-caj, and Macaroon in person so that was good.  Tina said she would stop by sometime but later on at night Tyke went down to Krispy Kreme with the gang and he left his phone at the house.  The suckiest part about the night was that he left his phone at home.  Because Tina called while he was gone asking if she could stop by on her way home to sorta say goodnight to Tyke and wish him well.  He tried to get a hold of her but couldn't.  The message she left for Tyke really made him sad.  He almost got teary eyed.  And he truly has no romantic feelings for her anymore but he still does think the world of her.  Not that he doesn't think the world of Karla or Purdy or Dotti.  Cuz he does.  Those 5 girls are so special to Tyke.  And that is really the main reason for Tyke's sadness in leaving.  Cuz if this was 3 years ago Tyke wouldn't have been that sad about leaving cuz he wasn't leaving anything behind for 19 days.  Now he is.  And that is tough.  Skippy of course will be missed as will Kinker and Amed, Dr. Phil, K-caj, Macaroon, Maniak, Tyronious, Mandy, DCups, Nene, Jew, MSwa, Piggy J (he called Tyke earlier in the night and they wished each other luck in their trips and also that he saw Kendal from Road Rules at the airport), and everyone else on Tyke's blog.  You guys are cool.  Good luck everyone.  This is going to be a fun trip so hopefully you all will have fun too.  And if you want a postcard but haven't talked to Tyke about it yet then leave a comment on the blog and he'll try to set something up to get your address.  He already knows of the girls and guy he will be sending postcards to.  And he will be able to blog at least once on the trip as he will be around internet cafes most likely.  But this is it.  The last blog in a while.  Long flight today...Tyke better not sleep much so that he can sleep a lot on the trip.  Damn...a little sad is Tyke.  The music isn't helping though.  Stupid donuts...stupid stupid stupid.  This could have been a great sendoff.  Don't look back.  Keep going forward.
