NerveStaple: How's life?  SomeLoser: why do you want to know  NerveStaple:  um... do i need a reason?   SomeLoser signed off at 5:50:39 PM.      In other news, an unnamed person (Who we'll call "Conor" for the time being) has threatened me and the good name of this site. I'm making an open call for bounty hunters: the first person who brings him to me ( alive, dead, horribly mutilated, half-eaten... I don't really care, it's all good ) will recieve a Shake 'N Bake coupon.  ( not valid outside continental US or in New Jersey )  End Transmission.
