I have this problem that i never know wat to tell and wat to talk, in the process not talking anything and boring the person with me. After a long time i got to chat with Raja today.  And passed him the Spooph folder, so he is all happy   Gay.        Yeah forgot to tell..... type i mean,  Myself, Atul  Amit Sood(Atul's Friend) went to Rennaisance today. Dont ask me hwy... Isnt that obvious. I wouldnt say i liked the place, cos everyone looked so very artificial, no one was being their own self. And then the singing lady also was there... She was dressed in a dull brown gown, or whatever it is called, i didnt like it anyway. One thing of being in Bombay is that you get to see such varied places, such varied people, and of course beautiful girls in skimpy dresses. Well i guess there is nothing else to add, well might bw there is, but as it is pretty late, am going for my nap. It is about 4.00 a.m in the morning right now. O k Good night.....
