NEW ANTHOLOGY -------------------------------------------------------------- The original short story Laurell wrote that wasn't long enough is going to get used! Here is a note from the publisher:  The book is pubbing in January 05, if you can believe that. In Jove, same as Cravings, only this one is all-vamp.  The other authors, all writing original stories using their principle characters and/or worlds are Charlaine Harris, MaryJanice Davidson,(who is in Cravings) Angela Knight,(a Sensation author who writes vampires in a kind of fantasy Arthurian world)and Vickie Taylor, who hasn't been pubbed by Berkley yet (coming in later 2005, I believe) but who does a Paranormal series for Harlequin involving gargoyles. (Romantic Paranormal with gargoyles--that must be interesting!  )   That's it for this bit! Smiles....Darla
