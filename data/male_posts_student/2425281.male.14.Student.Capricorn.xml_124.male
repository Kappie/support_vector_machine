Then again Andy might remove this blog, frame me for not blogging and forcefully extradite me to a place unknown - tushey. Blogging, similar to ranting and raving I see as a form of whining, whinging, whimpering (excuse alliteration). Why should one live in the past and reflect on whats happened. Move on I say! I shall stop now.
