Right when things seem to be falling into place, such as knowing about funding, having a good time with people, and having shows to see... things have to change. Yea, I've bitched about things, but in general this year has been many times better than last year.  Anyway I have a lot of work to get done this week before I'm busy with fun stuff this weekend and the Bouncing Souls show next week. I better get to it.  ***
