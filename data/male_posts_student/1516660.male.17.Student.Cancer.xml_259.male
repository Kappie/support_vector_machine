This blog entry would be appearing on a Monday, since I just came back from watching a movie (starring Stephen Chow. I forgot the title). However, I am too lazy to type it tomorrow (along with tomorrow's entry), so I decided to do it today then. (Woah! This must be the longest intro I ever made! HAHAHA!)  Okie. Today morning I woke up real early. And thankfully I did. It's 8 and the rest of the family is still sleeping (with the exception of my Dad of course). I woke them all up and I went to bath. After that, I watched TV, read the papers and ate breakfast.  At 11+, Dad came back. Me, Dad and Mom went to my godmum's house to bai nian la. Brother did not tag along, as he's too busy playing his computer games. Yao shu wor! Godmum's house was lively too. Lotsa aunties were there (actually, two), Auntie Irene and Auntie Veron. Kelly was there, and so was Uncle Steven (or issit Chris? So many uncles one! Okay. It is Steven). Me and Dad munched on the goodies and watched HZGG while Mother talked with the aunties, Steven and godmum. Mother tried to get inside info on the takeover of Shop N Save by Cold Storage (Uncle Steven is an IT specialist at CS. He's changing all the price codes too). Ooo... he didn't reveal much (coz he, like Mother, don't know much. HaHa!), just that those shops which are doing badly are gonna be closed down lor (My mother suspected 883's branch. Its sales was doing quite badly). Ooo. Anyway, we left at 1. KaiMa (Godma in Cantonese) gave me $10. Increasement wor! HAHA! Thanks!  After that, we went to AMK Central. I ate mian fen guo while the two parents ate hor fun. After that, the parents brought some VCDs (Chinese period dramas). Then, they went to Causeway Point. I met WQ in Popular. He was with his brother (who looked totally different! O.o! I thought it was WQ's Dad, but upon a closer observation, it was his brother. HaHa!). We brought some highlighters (for brother) and bedsheet sets. We went to the library afterwards. I borrowed a lot of "old" books, ones which I read a lot of times le. I want to read the classics again! HeHe! Even my mother called me crazy (she remembered a book and said I read it for so many times le). Oh well.   We came home at about 4, and I spent some time reading my book and going online till 6. We went to AMK (Lorong 1, not Central) to eat some seafood. There's this seafood stall (those kinda grand one and always chop tables for themselves one ar.... 883 got one) my Father says it's good. We ordered a lot of things la. The main attraction was this yu sheng. Yeah. So nice! HaHa! The grand total came to be $57.80. Ooo! After that, we went home.  After days of hongbao collecting, the total money I collected is an auspicious number! Woo! (More than my brother's by about $12. Who ask him don't go visit people? Heh heh!) My parents don't allow me to buy MahJong (shucks! Idiots!), so I have two options. I can save this auspicious figure into the bank, or I can use some of this money to buy Dido's CD and save the rest (and spoiling the auspicious figure). After much contemplation (and Wendy's input), I decided to put $88 into my bank. I can always save up for the CD. Heh Heh! Moo meow!  I must wake up at 7.20 tomorrow. According to many of my experiements, I take 40 minutes to bath. When I come out, it would be showing the gloden Globe Awards. Oh god...cannot. I don't want to miss the opening. Okay, 7.15 then. Moo meow!   I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
