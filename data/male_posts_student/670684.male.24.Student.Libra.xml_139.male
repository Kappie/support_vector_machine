Bill Moyers, a well-respected journalist and aptly dubbed "Renaissance Man," has an article out talking about the  urlLink solicitation of the American Flag  by pro-war activists in an attempt to utilize the patriot vs. non-patriot argument.  Moyers' last line is brilliant:   Come to think of it, standing up to your government can mean standing up for your country.   While many will scoff at the source of this news, IslamOnline.net reports that  over 350 Iraqi civilians have died since bombing began one week ago .  The news is from Iraq, so it is to be taken with a grain of salt...but then again, remember that the  urlLink news we get in America regarding war  is also monitored by the government.    Another  urlLink article regarding news censorship , this one about the website  urlLink yellowtimes.org .  The scariest thing about all of this is that George Bush still has a high popularity rating, and the Democratic party is too busy giving Republicans rim jobs rather than create a platform that will encompass leftists wanting to vote but understanding that the difference between John Kerry and George Bush are a few shades on the environment, a different accent, and another month of negotiations before bombing occurs.  And while this last article does present an argument for why we're taking Saddam out now, it also makes sure to let us know that  urlLink this was well pre-meditated , and diplomacy was the last thing on George "Fuck Saddam, we're taking him out" Bush's mind.  Hooray for vengance!  I always sleep better knowing our government is killing people so I can buy shit I don't need.  MORE - I like how we can spin the blame of a  urlLink Baghdad marketplace bombing  onto the Iraqi government, because "given the behaviors of the regime lately, it may have been a deliberate attack inside of town."  Extreme leftists blamed the 9/11 attacks on the CIA and Bush's penchant for war and a missile defense system; I think that claim is ludicrous.  So is this one.  We're bombing the beejeesus out of this city, at least take responsibility when something goes wrong.
