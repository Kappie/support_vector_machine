I know you can't feel and it hurts inside and all you can do is sit back and cry but when you least expect it she'll be there for you standing right by your side and you wont have to hide anymore Cause the pain leaves when the love's around and what is lost will soon be found You just gotta stand strong and believe that one day, one day she will see.
