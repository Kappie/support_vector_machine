       
      Just realised that I have to hand in my Java (due on Friday) tomorrow, because I was so damn unlucky to lose my Java disk on Friday the 13th (I should've known...). I re did Lab 4 in class, and I asked Yi Xian for some of Lab 5, so I hope I'm covered. Thanks to Yi Xian for graciously letting me "copy" his Java. (No, just kidding. I only used his to check). Anyway, tomorrow will be an interesting day and here's hoping everything will go well. I better not lose the disk again...
