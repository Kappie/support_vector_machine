I had a chance to check out some of the new content - your hero can now change their look as they grow - that's neat as there are somethings I'd like to change to match my new powers (works with my backstory too). They've also added a character copy tool so I can test out new powers before I take them. I also started my own Supergroup on there - MI-6. Rule Brittania yo. Chances are the server is going to get wiped, but that's quite alright. Oh yes. If you're not playing City of Heroes, you should be. Mwaha.  It rained this morning. I like waking up to the rain on days when I'm working - they call it "Retail Sunshine". It makes me feel good that I don't have the day off.  I was contemplating posting a picture of the Glennis up here, but that could probably be more trouble than it is worth. It's a funny picture mind you, so it's a tough call.
