I got to drive. Friday I went downtown and hung out with Angela, Matt, Chris, John, Robin and some her friends.  We hung out on Old Main lawn... pretty good... drove that night too. Saturday I went downtown once again and hung out with Angela, Matt, Chris, John, Katie Martin, Kate Sobel, Steph, Steph's "cousin" Jen, Robin and some of her friends. And then Chad showed up later cause he got home from the beach.  I didn't drive cause I wanted to stay for Kairos at 11:30 and I'm not aloud driving after 11 cause I have a Jr Lisence. Sunday I went downtown, not the last time, and then a bass lesson and then back downtown, I hung out with Angela, Chad, Chris, Jordan, Matt, Steph, Kate, Katelyn, Michelle, Meghan, Devon, Pat Powers, Robin, Becky, and Robin's friends. It was a pretty great concert.  Jordan Thomson sat in with the Earthtones on a couple songs which is pretty awesome.  His dad is the singer.  I drove that night too. Tonight I went to see Anchorman with Angela, Chad, Jordan, Chris and was surprised to see Robin and Adam.  It was a pretty great movie... I like the Character Brick the most... he was awesomely funny... You should see it if you haven't yet. We could not stop laughing.  Then we went to College Pizza and then waited for rides.  I drove and took Chad, so being the nice kids we are, we waited for everyone elses' ride to come.   All for the the nights I drove (and the only 4 times I've driven late enough at night to have to worry about the 11 pm rule since getting my lisence) I roled into my driveway at exactly 10:58...  Yep so I had a bunch of fun but now that the Arts Fest is over I'm not to sure what I'll do...  Yep so that about all I've been up to so thats all I really have to say...  I promise not to let it go as long before my next post.  -Dan V
