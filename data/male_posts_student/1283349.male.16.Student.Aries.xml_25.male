It's too bad that it's so hard. I really do wish I could waste more time.  On a lighter note, I got some new shiny dice! Woopee!  Oh, and it was my birthday yesterday. Doesn't that suck? I mean, come on, my birthday on a monday? Even worse, it's the very day we get back from Spring Break. The humanity!  -Dice Squirrel Squirreling a New Set of Dice
