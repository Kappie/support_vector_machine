Here's a few things I'd like to do this week: - see a movie (preferably half-priced at Westwood) There are still a buttload of movies I want to see  - play basketball or play video games or play a basketball video game  - Greek festival is this week...its fun...eat some greek food, drink some beer, do a weird circle dance with a bunch of sweaty Greek people...  - go to dinner...eating is my favorite hobby  - drink, drink, drink! We have so many bars to go to, so little time! We've got the bars in downtown, lakewood, rocky river, westlake, avon lake, north ridgeville, etc...
