It probably won't pay very well, but at least it's some experience in that area, so maybe after a few months there I will have a shot at Future Shop or something.  I had fun yesterday. I went Christmas tree hunting with Crystals family. They fight a lot, but it's not as much as my family when we do things like that. That is probably why my family never does things like that. I don't really have much to say...I'm still selling a USB-based video capture device, so if any of y'all got some cash....  Holy crap it's December.  urlLink  postCount('dec12002');
