But, i remembered that i had a crazy YO practice from 10:30 to 12:30 and then a lunch break and then the concert at 2. So i got dressed and started the drive over but then my mom called and i had left some tickets and the purple form which had all the tickets i had sold for the contest at home...so we drove back and at the last second got back to the free way and i was about a minute late...turned in my pruple form, only missed a couple announcements...and we practiced, then i found out at lunch time that i had WON the CONTEST and i get a free deck of cards, two free Mahler tickets to any of the SFS Mahler 2 concerts, $50 gift certificate to Flight 001 travel store ( urlLink  ) and i got the GRAND PRIZE which was one of the two official Bon Voyage concert posters, which i got for myself...which im gonna put up in my rooms which is pretty empty on the walls, so its a good addition. anyway, tomorrow i have to go to some Fathers Day breakfast at the church...ho hum.
