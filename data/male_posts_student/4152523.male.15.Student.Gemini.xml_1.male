My sisters getting married in 2 weeks and were the ones doing everything, theres no outside help, so anything thats getting done is getting done by me and my family. Also, I just picked up Doom III, and a few new pairs of adult diapers.  Before you think what I know your thinking, its because of Doom. It is the scaryist videogame I have ever played. The graphics feel and look so lifelike, it's scary. The way the game just grabs you and sucks you into it is absolutley amazing. When you mix in the sounds, forget about it. Your no longer you, your a marine on mars, trying to escape with your life. And thats just from walking around in the game. Needless to say, the monstors poping out of the walls, or the blood on the walls just sweetens the experience oh so much more.  Ive also been studying for a hunter saftey course, so I can go hunting with my sisters Fiance. Thats tommarow, and im trying to finish almost the entire book in one night. Luckily, i know most of the stuff, I just have to finish the questions.  Im off to go work on the book, so ill post later with something with more substance.
