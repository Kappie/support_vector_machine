My MiMi is in the hostpital and just seeing her lying in the bed brought back all the memories from 3 years ago of my PaPa. It was like I saw him there for a moment. Whenever MiMi coughed and winced at the pain in her chest I saw my PaPa react the same way to coughing.  Three years ago was pretty much the time I lost all faith in God, and love for him as well.  There was no need to let my poor PaPa suffer for as long and as hard as he did...yet God allowed it.  I have not gotten over that and don't think I will anytime soon.  PaPa I miss you so much and I hope MiMi comes to you with as little pain as possible.
