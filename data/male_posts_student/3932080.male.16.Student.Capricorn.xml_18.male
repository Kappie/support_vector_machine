Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Why -Jadakiss feat. Anthony Hamilton Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #36 Throughout pop music history, interrogative jams have been sexual ( Lil' Kim's  "How Many Licks?"), bashful ( Liz Phair's  "Why Can't I?"), longing ( Third Eye Blind's  "How's It Gonna Be"), biting ( D12's  "How Come"), weeping ( LeAnn Rimes'  "How Do I Live") and romantic ( Brandy's  "Have You Ever"), but rarely do they pack political punches, save the recent "Where is the Love?" Actually, with "Why," Jadakiss seems to one-up the Black Eyed Peas, as he asks over 50 questions in a headlining single cut for radio. Some of them are legitimatly intelligent ("Why did Bush have to knock down the towers"), some blatantly used just to rhyme ("Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Crist"), and some just absurdly unnecessary ("Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar"). Rocking a stutter-step bell line that recalls every nursery rhyme beat from "Rock Superstar" to "Wanskta," Jadakiss avoids becoming nagging by keeping an impressive flow and stopping every now and then to let Anthony Hamilton play Yoda in a wise and soulful chorus. Whether or not Jada was trying to update that one world-conscious question ("What's goin' on?"), he managed to perk up everyone's ears with this track, the ultimate summer Q  A with Qs that are easier to answer than, say, "can I get a what what?"
