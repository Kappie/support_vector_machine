Why did I not say so long? I remember the days of Pong, and good old Donkey Kong  Now you are gone from here Never to see you, is what I fear  I will never forget who you are Because we have come so far  Together forever that’s what we said You left me, you practically fled  Now I am all alone I try to call you on the phone  I never get through to talk I wish we could go on one last walk  Now as I write this I see You peering through the window at me  You came back to see me one last time I guess I was worth your dime  I really missed you its no lie Because I wish I had said goodbye
