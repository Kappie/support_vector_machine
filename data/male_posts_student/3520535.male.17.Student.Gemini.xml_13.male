Robert and Michelle were speaking mostly to themselves and then they both left. And I don't want to sleep but have nothing else to do. Can't get ahold of Zach. I'd like to speak to Sarah. I heard she tried to reach me. So many fucked up things are happening to my family. I'll be at more than one funeral before it's over.  I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you  Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties And one day passed away in his sleep And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days And passed away  I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong That I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest
