Look at the size of his putter.  2. Oh, dang, my shaft's all bent.  3. You really wacked the hell out of that sucker.  4. After 18 holes I can barely walk.  5. My hands are so sweaty I can't get a good grip.  6. Lift your head and spread your legs.  7. You have a nice stroke, but your follow through leaves a lot to be desired.  8. Just turn your back and drop it.  9. Hold up. I've got to wash my balls.  10. Damn, I missed the hole again.
