I have been every busy with work, babysitting and trying to keep eric in line!(that is almost impossible!) my life has been very boring for the last couple of days! nothing out of the ordinary has really happened, well except last nite i didnt come home until 4 am and my mom called the cops on me and now i am being kicked out of her house! o well! dad's house here i come! the other nite i had this guy come in and scare the heck out of me, he was yelling at me and all this other crap. my boss found out and is now filing a restraint against him to never come back again or else he is going to be arrested! i have never been so mad that i was shaking, but i was that night! Sun. night i went to the drive-in and watched the dumbest movies i have ever seen! dodgeball and the day after next or something like that, i dont remember wat it is called! today, eric came and seen me! i was pretty excited bout that because i havent seen him in awhile, well since he got his neck injury! (big baby!) I got my new cell phone saturday! i was pretty excited about that since my mom has always told me that i dont need my own cell phone! it is one of those camera phones! i like it! and today when eric was out my house, the lil theif tried to steal it! well i have to go do laundry! blog to ya lata! -ash-
