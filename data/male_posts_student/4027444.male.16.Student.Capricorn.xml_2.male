Firstly however I shall explain the title of my journal: "Cognosce Te Ipsum" (latin) for "Know Thyself" and IMO this includes knowing who to be thankfull to (and for ).  Photo Situation: - Today I worked 6 hours straight and another 3 hour on top of that (other work) and so: I didn't have time to pick up my film from the lab. Tommorow I have even more () work awaiting me so, I WILL pick up the film, however it is unlikely I'll have time to get any deviations done...  Aknowledgments:  Inspirational: *coxi and ~Greendash I thank you for your wonderful art that has so often inspired my own or motivated me to try my best: kudos, dudes   Technical: I can't thank my good friend ~Ritaly enough: he's found time in his busy schedule to go shooting with me, and then sit in my basement into the late hours of the night helping me out with photoshop. He's a friend, fellow artist, and phenomenal photoshop-bitch . Thanks a lot man...
