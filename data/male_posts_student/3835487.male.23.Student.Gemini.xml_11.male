Do you!? And if you throw in the 20 dollars I ripped out of the lady at the collectibles shop (she was selling comics and baseball cards for a cut rate, what a moron!), I saved 32 dollars! You can't put a value on the X-Men, now can you? And someday, those Pujols cards will be my ticket to retirement, I tell you...Sotheby's (sp?) here I come! On a sidenote, does anyone remember that cartoon on MTV like 10 years ago called Aeon Flux? Well, she really looks like Psylocke of the X-Men. I think that they copied her look. And if this has fallen too much into dork-related territory, please let me know. I am 23 years old, I think.  Just a week till Destin. I can already feel the sand between my feet...now if I can only make it through my paper. I'm on page 12...only 6 left, I'm aiming to finish tommorow so I have a few days to chill before my sister comes to visit. I enjoy seeing my relatives but it becomes a hassle when people stay for longer than 2 days...luckily, I'll be in Florida for most of the time. I just hope my dog does not attack my 3-year-old niece TOO much... and on a sidenote, I hope there are some attractive girls down there, is that too much to ask for?  This update was to appease the masses. Not much intelligent thought is left in my brain tonight, as evidenced by this post. I'm talking about the X-Men for heaven's sake. And on an angering note, I was alerted by Smith that there may not be an  X-Men 3 ...unlike tax free weekend, this revelation really HAS rocked me to the core...in fact, so much that I may just go into hiding all together.  Peace. Alex
