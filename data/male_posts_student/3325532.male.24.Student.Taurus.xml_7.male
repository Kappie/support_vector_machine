We're still convinced they're in the same trees they were in before because the moment I get close to the tree, BOTH mom and dad start flying around like crazy, chirping and squaking at me until I leave - they're probably protecting them.  We read up a bit about robins and apparently, they are most vulnerable for the first 3 days after leaving the nest, especially to cats who often try catching them since they don't fly much. Also, if the nest was successful, the mother will make another nest nearby and lay eggs again (and possibly a third time again later). The interesting thing is that the father will continue to care for the baby robins for up to three weeks after leaving the nest! They must all stay nearby, so I'm confident we'll find them again. Going to try doing a thorough search again tommorrow.
