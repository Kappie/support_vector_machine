Ok: LaCie 4x DVD burner, a new iPod dock, strongbad t-shirt, a board game called Red-Handed, new socks like Noah's brother Aaron had, "True Grizz" a book about grizzly bears, the Worst-Case Scenario holiday book, a new clock, a "Coinstruction" set, asweater, a pair of khackis, and slipppers. I would say I did damn well. We ate some carmel strata for breakfast - for you uncultured suckas thats french toast with carmel. We also ate pineapple and strawberries. Get this: going to have tea at 2:00. That's high class.
