We also went to some really boring museums and fort sumptner where the most hilarious thing happened on this vacation there was this tuor guy of this confederate army official he was one of those guys that took his job way to seriously he was clad all in this army uniform and had that funny cowboy slash army hat and he yelled instead of talked and had that funny mustache and when he was yelling he would actually spit sometimes but the most funny thing was the way he talked he talked in a southern forest Gump voice it was so funny so me being you know the obnoxious guy I am walk up to him and ask him hey can you say for me life is like a box of chocolates I kid you not he goes all red in the face leans forward and goes DO YAH THIN THATâ€™S FUNNY YAN KEEE with that forest Gump pause in the middle sounding just like forest Gump he like yelled really loud and spit in my face as he talked of course and I was like yep as I like jogged slashed power walked away really fast cracking up
