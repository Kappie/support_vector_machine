So to James Willock, I am sorry.    A year ago I blogged regularly at my old site. It's unbelievable how fast year ten went, and how much better, but at the same time worse, my life is now. Back then, I was angsty and depressed and stuff. I had a girlfriend, but I never saw her. Now I have a real social life and friends whom I actually like rather than just tollerate. I mean, I'm still friends with the others, but they aren't the winners, and stuff, y'know. I'm still friends with Ben, but I'm working on shaking him off. Somehow, though, in retrospect, last year was just so good. I was more laid back, life was so easy. The fact that I had a girlfriend, no matter how little I saw of her, was a good enough excuse to stop putting myself down over that fact that I didn't  really  have one. I had, on the whole, very little to worry about. It's strange, because although I my life is much better now, and I'm probably much happier, I can shake off the feeling that last year felt so much better. Hind sight is crap.
