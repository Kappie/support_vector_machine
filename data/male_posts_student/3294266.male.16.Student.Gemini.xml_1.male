The greatest offenders are Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which provides a very conservative bias as a media conglomerate, and Viacom, which provides many poor quality programmes aimed at young audiences through its MTV brand.  Major media corporations and conglomerates seek money from their operations above all else. They loose their political neutrality and moral standard from this selfish desire to make every cent they possibly can.  Canada's CanWest has taken advantage of deregulation here in New Zealand, purchasing a large proportion of New Zealand's radio and television stations. They have tried to control local radio station content from Auckland to get a result that is best commercially, and in the process ignored the importance these radio stations have on local culture.  The commercialised evening news in New Zealand that Dr Edwards criticises so very much is, according to him, the result of deregulation. I have to say there is credit in this: if it was not the cause, then it was atleast a contributing factor.  The BBC, Australian ABC, PBS and NPR are perfect examples of public broadcasting services providing quality programmes under limted commercial influence. I believe that major commercially-orientated media companies could do a similar service and still recieve significant financial gain.
