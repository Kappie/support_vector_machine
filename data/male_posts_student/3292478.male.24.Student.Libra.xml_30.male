I just have to have a moan about  Kitten    urlLink     She comes across as someone who feels very insignificant in society and who has come into the Big Brother house in order to try and manipulate her new surroundings in order to reverse those roles. The fact that they are now all enclosed within the  'Big Brother bubble'  seems to be a key which Kitten feels that she will now become significant, and more in control.  Within 24 hours of being in the house she was openly discussing ideas of rebelling against the nomination process. Firstly, this seemed to be Kitten 'testing the water' to see how people would respond to her being dominant and dictating, and secondly, it seemed to be her openly displaying her inner worries about being unliked, still insignificant, even in the BB bubble, and therefore nominated. Another display of defiance, during the first nomination task, led to her being overlooked by Big Brother and unable to vote. I got the feeling she wanted Big Brother to keep pestering at her to get into the diary room. She look miffed when they moved straight on, and became rather introverted when it became clear that her wonderful rebellion was already beginning to backfire.  Continued acts of disrespect and defiance against Big Brother are always followed by tentative looks around at her fellow housemates, indicating a sense of wanting to be seen and to be accepted. Accepted not only as the dominant personality in the house but, primarily, accepted as a member of the house.  I believe she is genuinely worried that she is not going to last a few weeks, and the bravado she displays in her rebellion against dictating Big Brother is merely a sorry facade for her need to feel wanted and accepted.  We shall see!!
