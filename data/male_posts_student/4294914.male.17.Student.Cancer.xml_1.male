I love you with a love that has no limits, because I love you as I am loved.  Do not run away from Me. Come back to Me---not once, not twice, but always again. You are My child. How can you ever doubt that I will embrace you again, hold you against My breast, kiss you and let My hands run through your hair? I am your  God ---the  God  of mercy and compassion, the  God  of pardon and love, the  God  of tenderness and care. Please do not say that I have given up on you, that I cannot stand you anymore, that there is no way back. It is not true. I so much want you to be with Me. I so much want you to be close to Me. I know all your thoughts. I hear all your words. I see all of your actions.  And I love you because you are beautiful, made in My own image, an expression of My most intimate love.  Do not judge yourself. Do not condemn yourself. Do not reject yourself.  Let My love touch the deepest, most hidden corners of your heart and reveal to you your own beauty, a beauty that you have lost sight of, but which will become visible to you again in the light of My mercy . Come, come, let Me wipe your tears, and let My mouth come close to your ear and say to you, ‘ I love you, I love you, I love you .'
