Have you ever thought of them as annoying or gross?  Today they invaded Cleveland. I live there.  Let me tell you something. May flies come by here every six months. However, since they die in 24 hours, their reproduction rate is faster than you can imagine. Within seconds, they cover the streets, houses, windows, sidewalks, bikes, cars, and street lights. You name it, they sit on it.  Then they die.  They don't move now. The wind doesn't blow them, because of the sticky secretion on their feet. The sun doesn't dry them up.  You just walk on them, step on them, and live with bug guts for at least a week.  What's so interesting about the may fly?  It leaves a nice crunch when you step on it. In all the places that they are.  Per square foot.
