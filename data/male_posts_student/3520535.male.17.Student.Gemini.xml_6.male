I expanded and added to the original and left some questions alone that would not be entirely accurate because of the time in which they were answered that I left in place for various reasons, usually I thought they told some little thing about me you all should know. Give this to whomever you’d like and feel free to ask me any questions. I am and open book that has an open door and though this poses some serious structural problems I am emotionally content with the situation. Take care of yourselves because yes, I do care.

Maybe it looks pretty, ok, but I’m not often moved by art, nor do I have the talent for it. 37. Mythology? Not really, I do seem to be getting into Beowulf though. But that’s probably because of my interest in history and Anglo-Saxon. 38. Pop culture? No. Most of the things I like tend not to be that popular.

He has to understand what exactly his past is and realizes that it becomes painful to hear. He falls in love amidst much death, international intrigue, and mystery, and his whole story has a sense of historical irony to it. I love that sort of thing. 67. If you could change the ending of any story, what story would you choose? The illuminatus! Trilogy would make more sense. Currently none of it does. 68. How would you change it?
