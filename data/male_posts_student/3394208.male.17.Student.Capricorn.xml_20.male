I stood up and walked towards the kitchen 4:00 in the morning the clock glares at me Nothing in the refrigerator just left over fried chicken i gaze at the stove, thinking it would cook something for me  Cooking up a meal, damn i'm too lazy just grab some canned goods and shove it and nuke it Vinna sausage, pork and beans and corned beef too messed up to think, shit just blenderize the shit
