Someone had brought a puffin bar and we were throwing it around the tent "ATTACK OF THE PUFFIN MWAHAHA".  Everyone was hypo from all the fizzy pop and suggary snacks we bought from Tesco and that...  Anyway...  The evening started about 9pm, James turned up with the tent etc, shortly followed by Craig and Sam who helped put the tent up (it only took 2 tries and we got it right!).  We went to Tesco to get loads of food and then watched some of Monty Python and the UK Simpsons Episode ("...Henrietta R. Hippo", "Yes Bart, an elephant's butt...") while we pigged out on a tub of raspberry ripple ice-cream!!  We then cooked pizza and eat it in the tent (It was quite tasty for a cheep Tesco pizza!!) and then stayed up for ages talking and going hypo.        (Don't ask... Sam ate a bit too much sugar!)  And as normal, after a night full of sugar and being on a sugar high, the morning sugar low set in.  I felt like s**t!  Now after a bit of brekkie I feel fine :)
