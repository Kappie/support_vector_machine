I'm not gonna front and say it was easy, but I hadn't expected that.  Nor am I going to say it was hard.  Most people freaked out about it, and were happy when it was simple.  Me, I hadn't expected much, and got something.  Not to bad though, I kind of lost my will to write by the last essay.  People were overjoyed about the DBQ though.  I guess that's enough though.  I don't need ETS coming after me.  Let's see, what else?    Ooh colleges.  I think I may just apply to Howard (The #2 best Historically Black College in my opinion second only to Spelman/Morehouse (since they are ladies and men only respectively) to see if I can get in.  The only problem is, to accomodate to most black people who desire to go their the standards are lower to get in, because they want to attract as many black people of all intellectual and social standings to hopefully create the New Black Generation.  I guess they succeeded too, my great-grandfather (my Grammy's father) graduated from Howard and went on to become a doctor.  One of the first black doctors too, and during the depression.  Does that make me a Bougie Negro?  But besides that, where I want to go-  1. NYU 2. UVA 3. U. SoCal (yeah right) 4. UMD 5. Loyola 6. Rutgers 7. Cornell (or any of those 'last name' schools in NY)
