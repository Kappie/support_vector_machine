We got plenty of kids joining in during the week and the whole thing, including the barbeque tonight has been a great success, and there is another barbeque tomorrow night. It has been quite fun and a big success.  I have managed eventually to regain my land legs after last week, not easy trying to walk properly when suffering from lack of sleep and land sickness...lol  It is harder to get online at the moment, since we hav left AOL completely now...we have two Broadband Force9 accounts, and are hopefully getting a router so I can access the internet again through the other computer (or from laptop)  Apart from that, not much has been going on. I been playing Thief again, and a few retro games in my spare time, and am planning on designing a new forum signature for use in many forums...and also planning on drawing Cerberus.  Anyway, thats all for now. Happy Hunting.
