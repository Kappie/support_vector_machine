I'm finding my way back to sanity again Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I get there Take a breath and hold on tight Spin around one more time And gracefully fall back to the arms of grace  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah Where I wanna be  I'm looking past the shadows in my mind, into the truth and I'm Trying to identify the voices in my head, God, I wish it were you Let me feel one more time what it feels like to feel and Break these callouses off of me one more time  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to sit outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah  Oh, I don't want a thing from you I bet you're tired of me waiting for the  Scratch to fall off of your table to the ground  Cause I just wanna be here now  Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't wanna speak tonight That's all right, all right with me Cause I want nothing more than to stand outside Heaven's door And listen to you breathing, it's where I wanna be, yeah Where I wanna be
