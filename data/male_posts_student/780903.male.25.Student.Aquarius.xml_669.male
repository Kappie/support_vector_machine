If you really really really messed up, and you think you can do better than you did, take it again.  This whole interview season thing tells me that some advice  urlLink this blogger  gave a while ago was right -- you kinda do want to go to the best school you can if you want to maximize your chances of getting a high-paying lawyer job (or getting into academia) afterwards.  Of course, if your reasons for going to law school don't involve the high-paying lawyer job (and I say that absolutely with a straight face -- tons of other reasons to be at law school, whether they be other kinds of lawyer jobs, job advancement that may require a law degree, just want to learn cool stuff about law, bored and wealthy... I'm sure more I'm not thinking of), then maybe no big deal.  But it really does seem like where you go to school correlates kind of strongly (probably too strongly) with the job stuff available to you right out of school, and LSAT score correlates kind of strongly with where you get in.  So maybe not terrible advice to perhaps think about taking it again if you know you should have done better and really think you can.  Of course, every situation is different; this isn't great advice for every situation.  Obviously.  2. If you did much better than you thought you'd do, probably don't take it again.  Yes, I had to go and ruin a serious post with an attempt at humor.  Sorry about that.  But, seriously, if you aced the thing and thought you'd be going to University of Phoenix Online and now you can get into Yale, congratulations and never tell anyone you thought you'd get a 132 and got 45 points higher.  3. If you got about what you thought you'd get, and it's not as good as you'd want, but you don't know what to do about it, take a deep breath.  And ignore point #1.  It's elitist and silly.  People who do really really well pretty much everywhere get jobs at exactly the same places that people at the very top schools do.  Location starts to matter -- if you want to work in Kansas, don't go to law school in Nebraska (ed. note: Kansas and Nebraska are right next to each other.  My response:  Oops.  Yeah, I guess maybe they are.  I just lump them all together in the big mass in the middle.).  But yeah, location may matter -- go to school where you want to work -- and you have to do really really well for certain jobs -- but doors are not all closed.  Still lots of opportunities.  You'll survive, you'll have a law degree, you'll be fine.  4. If you received your score report, but accidentally lost it before opening it and don't know how you did, call the LSAT people.  I'm sure for something like $428, they can send you another copy.  If you beg.
