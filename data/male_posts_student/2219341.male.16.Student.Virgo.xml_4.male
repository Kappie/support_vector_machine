Beke and Claire are here from England.  we're havin a great time.  im gonna watch Nemo later tonight i think.  of course!  hahaha!  i like this girl.  someone else likes her too.  we both know that we both like her.  its confusing.  i actually think its funny.  its not awkward or anything.  which is awesome.  cuz i hate it when people are all awkward around eachother.  i dunno though.  i personally doubt she'd like either of us.  but ya never know.  im actually more skeptical about me.  i dont think she'd ever like me.  im more of a friend to her.  and thats probably all ill ever be.  i seem to stuck with that alot.  there have been plenty of girls that i've liked but that wouldnt go out with me...or even consider me cuz i was just a friend.  i guess it can be frustrating.  but then again...i can always be there for them as a friend.  ha!  there's this one girl who i've really liked for a long time.  she'd never give me a chance.  i even asked her out twice.  well sorta...the second time was kinda indirectly.  but still!  she's like someone i'd wish would give me a chance but she just wont.  she likes other guys and im just a friend.  which doesnt really bother me that much.  i mean i guess its sorta better bein her friend.  i've always been there for her just like she's always been there for me.  so i guess it worked out the way God wanted it to.  anyways.  slightly complicated.  but yeah i like this new girl.  she's very nice.  of course so does he.  i feel guilty.  like i do like her but i feel maybe he deserves her more.  i dunno.  im trying to decide if im even going to attempt anything.  i dunno.  AHHHHHHH!  SO CONFUSING!  ok well im going to go have dessert!  oh yeah!  adios amigos!
