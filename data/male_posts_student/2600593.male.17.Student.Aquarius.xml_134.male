      Well I went and saw The Village last night and I was pretty good, If you like any of M. Night Shamylan's other movies you will like this one. I want give away anything, but after you see this you will have differnet view of society.  He is a pretty good director, and all his other movies are: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs.  All really good movies.
