I'm so... annoyed? I hate waking up to shouting... And now my mom was crying and screaming and my dad.  And my sisters.  So now I'm waiting... we're supposed to go somewhere... are we going? I dunno.  I said I wouldn't go with Trisha because we're going...  Parents have no respect.  Do they care about anyone else?  No.  So that was a birthday a few days ago.  And Kas's birthday is coming up.  :)  BTW.  I'M NOT SAD.  I feel nothing right now but annoyance... it's hot.  Well, Von's coming back on Monday or Tuesday ^^ Yatta!  And...
