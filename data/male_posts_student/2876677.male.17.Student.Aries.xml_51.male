I got home and changed before my grandparents(who are staying with us this weekend) saw me.  I decided to go "Hipster Scout" this evening.  Needless to say, the reaction to me dressed this way was quite interesting.  No one understands why I like to dress this way.  Not even me.  Some days I like prep*  Some days I like Hipster Scout.    *By prep, I do not mean Abercrombie, AE, or Aero.  I mean nice clothing.  Like Gap, and Banana Republic and Structure and occasionally Old Navy has some nice clothes.  When I say prep, I mean nice classy looking clothing.  Not faded ripped up shorts and tees with "Abercrombie" written across the front in permanent marker.
