A classroom full of ideas and innovation. A room full of learning but at the same time full of fun. A room with knowledge and design. A room with futurity.  This is inspiration from the future.   This is inspiration from myself.  INTODUCTION: Visually, the room is just a simple white room with no design. It's just a plain painted room with a single switch in one of the corners. Once the switch is turned on, the room is now transformed into a prism-lighted place with no borders. Students would be free to go anywhere the want to go with the place, which is full of blank hologram walls where each student could have one hologram and turn it into something they could get knowledge from. The hologram could present concepts more than mathematics, science, computer, language and positively many knowledge based in an infinite number of books and resources put in one. The lessons and concepts will be shown using visuals and sounds, where each student has his own place. The student will be the only one to visualize and hear the sounds and media from his own hologram system. The other students would be in their own "world". The hologram wall would not just present them but will also give out quizzes in a style of games. Not only will they be presenting fun but also impossible limits of learning.  Design and Controls: The design would include over-to-date technology with unbelieveble media. The learning style will be fun and exciting. This is something everyone would like to achieve.  Learning: The learning is execptional. This is a kind of learning where everyone would be able to express their ideas, to gain confidence and will.  Place: The room is just one simple room when turned off. But when the system is switched, we are then transported into the world of knowledge.
