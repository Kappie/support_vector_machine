Over vacation, the animals slaughtered the South Korean hostage, and it appears last night they murdered a US soldier with a bullet to the back of the head.  As of right now, they have a Pakistani, three Turks and a US Marine in custody and are threatening to behead them.  Putting aside my blind rage for the moment, I'm puzzled by this new collection of hostages.  If you recall a few weeks ago during the Saudi hostage siege, the terrorists made a point of releasing all muslim hostages unharmed.  They've also taken great pains to paint this conflict as a religious war against the infidels.  While it isn't unusual for muslims to murder muslims (take a look at Palestinian vigilente actions against anyone who tries to find a peaceful solution with Israel), it is unusual in the ongoing struggle in Iraq.  Surely they have access to non-Muslim hostage candidates.  They managed to snag a US Marine after all, but what are the odds they randomly get a Muslim Marine?    Are they targeting a new audience?  Are they growing more desperate?  Nick Berg and Paul Johnson got them nowhere, and it looks like South Korea isn't going away.  Is this a message to the Iraqi people that being a Muslim will no longer protect you?    The five men are certainly doomed, and it still troubles me to see little outrage in the Muslim world.  It will be telling if the death of Muslim men finally generates some reaction.
