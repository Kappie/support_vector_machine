You've probably herd "Bittersweet Symphony" and "Sonnet." It's real good! But this song "The Rolling People" sound JUST like a Radiohead song it's unbelievable! All and all, good stuff!  Well, if ya like stuff like Radiohead and U2, you'll definitely like The Verve! Go pick up Urban Hymns, it's probably in the $8 section cuz it's kinda old. Go get it!
