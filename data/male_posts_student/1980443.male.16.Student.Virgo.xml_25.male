The two things I really learned on the trip was that God works through people everywhere (I already knew that, It was just really emphasized, so..) and the second thing was that I'm so thankful for our school!  Some of those kids there were really really jerks!  I mean horrible!  It was like they were bitter to us.  Out of the 7 different school, almost all 7 were pretty rude.  Our school rocks...  Of course, you're always thankful for the nerds at the schools cause they're the ones that come up and talk to us.    There were a few of those at each school - so everyone who reads this - be nice to guests!  It really helps. I mean, you don't have to always reach out to everyone especially in the Christian Lee case.   It's really good to be home!    The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
