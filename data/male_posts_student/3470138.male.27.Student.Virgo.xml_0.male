It was a sentence, a statement, an oath that you couldn't belive exited your own mouth and sallied forth into the world, and after it was said it couldn't be taken back. Then once you heard it said you knew it to be true.  You knew deep down that this was part of your inner self leaping up to seize your tongue.  You could not deny it.  You could try, but the truth of it compelled you to admit it.  I've had a couple of those in my life.  I'll give you the first right now, it's by now means the best, but it is the first realization that I've ever experienced.  I'll begin with a little background.  I went to a small college, and I was on the schools very first collegiate swim team, I was the only Distance swimmer on the team, everyone else was a sprinter.  There were eight kids on the original team, seven guys and one girl, a majority came from the state where I went to school.  The long and the short of it was I was really annoyed by the girl,  we'll call her Sharon, I was convinced that I hated her, and my reaction to my friend starting to date her eventually cost me my friendship with him.  SO this went on for a while until she confronted me.  She said "Swimmercrazy, why do you hate me?" My response was immediate, I didn't even think about my answer. "I don't hate you, I don't hate anybody." And right after the words exited my mouth, I knew they were true.  I also knew that I was the one at fault.  I tried to repair the damage that had been done, but it was no use.  But I knew then that I didn't hate anyone, lest of all Sharon.  I've carried me with me to this day. It helped me know myself, but in the end it was a costly lesson.
