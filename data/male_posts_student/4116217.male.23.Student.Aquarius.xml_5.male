While I mostly disagree with Neil's result on face, it seems to me that the real problem is that his model of a populace oppressing a minority seems in error; to wit, governments don't make oppressive laws on a whim, but because some constituency is actually calling for them. What I mean by this is that we shouldn't model this situation as one minority strongly in favor with a majority mildly against, but as two minorities, each strongly on their own side (in Neil's situation, gays v. christian conservatives) with a majority leaning one way or another. I'm not sure how the numbers balance out in all situations (haven't done the math), but the if we consider the symmetric case, we see that representatives should vote with the majority or their conscience, just as we end up with in the direct democracy situation.  It should be noted that I am in favor of a representative system, for a lot of reasons (some mathematical), just not because they respect minority rights better for any structural reason.
