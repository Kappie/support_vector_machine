I tried bench-pressing which works out your chest muscles, and i could only do 20kg. For my friends this is weak since they all can do at least 40kg. So today i tried doing it again and i improved. Now i can carry 35kg. Plus i have the strongest abdomen in my group xD So this gym thing will be a routine thing for me, and i'll try going twice a week.   Moving on......Today i played indoor soccer, for2 freaking hours. I was fun but because all of my friends were slide tackling me (since im soooo good) i sprained my ankle. Its not that bad but it has been my 9th injury this year alone o.O Tomorrow, there's this Hari Anak Upacara, and im lazy to go...but i have to. Ah tired i want to sleep. This will be enough for today.      KEEP WATCHING THE STARS!!    god how i hate the X-files xD
