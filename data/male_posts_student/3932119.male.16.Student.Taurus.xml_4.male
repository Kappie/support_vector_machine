My goal for this blog is to post news about Music and my favorite bands along with other useless shit I feel like putting on here. I will also be posting news about the local band I'am in : The Soda Fountain Suicides and our quest to get gigs. If you live in the Berrien County area and are having a party or something give us a ring and we will play for whatever you decide is fair. If you are serious about it then come on down to Bridgman and ask for Neal and I will try to get you in for one of our practices so you can decide for yourself. Now that my pathetic attempt to advertise is over, I would also like to say that if you find any spelling/grammatical errors on this blog then you can just shut the hell up because I really dont give a damn. For every posting be sure to check out the "song of the day" section and the "Soda Fountain Suicides News".   Song of the Day: "Shatter" by From Autumn to Ashes  Soda Fountain Suicides News: Jon (the drummer) has finally finished baseball so we might be able to practice again. Hannah( bass player) has decided to let her boy friend play bass for us since she is so busy. Jon and I are going to suggest to Bill (frontman and lead guitar) that we cover the A Perfect Circle song "Judith".
