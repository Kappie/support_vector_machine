Then about an hour through, I got hungry and decided to eat something; I chose kix. Then I got out the guitar and started practicing this song I like called "Doin' The Cockroach". I think it's a really cool song. Then I got sick of it and started messing around with some other tunes and things that I've been working on and realized that it's a lot harder to make meaningful music than most people (including me) think. I called Sara to ask if she was free today, but she wasn't. I called Peter and I forget what we even talked about, but we talked about something of no great importance, seeing how I don't really  remember it. It wasn't bad or anything though, just... irrelevant. Then I lied around the house, finding different places that were comfortable. I picked up the guitar yet again, practiced some more, got sick of it, and then went online again. I saw Christina online, so said hi and we talked for a while. That was nice, as always. I got some irritating messages from my sister too though, which wasn't as nice. My cousin IM'd me too, but we didn't talk about anything worth mentioning here, so whatever. I made something to eat* while talking to people, too. Surprisingly, those lean cuisine things aren't as bad as I thought they were. I mean, they're not exactly the finest culinary experience, but they get the job done well enough :-). It was about the only thing in the freezer that didn't take like 3 hours to make and the only other options were cereal with water, raisins, various spices, maybe some popcorn (I forget and I'm too lazy to check), and soup. And since I had already had soup that day, I didn't really feel like having it again. Then I took a nap at around 1800ish and woke up an hour later. Then I wandered around the house and took another hour-long nap and woke up at around 2030ish. While I was sleeping, my dad called and invited me to dinner with him and this guy he's starting one of his businesses with, named Erik. He's got a PhD from the Media Lab and a masters from Harvard. He's pretty hardcore, but human at the same time. Anyway, being the deep sleeper I am, I didn't hear the phone vibrate all over the hardwood floor from across the house and so I couldn't go. And here I am now, writing a post about my uneventful day. Judging by the length of this post, one might guess I had a pretty exciting day, but I just went into unneeded detail about some obscure things. I guess that's just what I do though.  Thought of the undefined-time-period, I have a theory that most teenage bloggers are spoiled runts who just have way too much for their own good. I'm not excluding myself from this, by the way. I am spoiled. I mean, really, everything that I've done that's worth mentioning was not from my own perspiration, per se. I have had all kinds of opportunities provided by my uncles and dad, only though which I was allowed to do most of the things I do. Then again, to be reasonable, everyone has their own set of opportunities and hinderances, so to call someone spoiled because of something they couldn't control seems unfair. Perhaps a better metric is their attitude, outlook on life, and relationships with other people (no, not just something as stupid and remedial as dating. I mean like everyday interactions with people. e.g. Are you arrogant?) in relation to how many opportunities they've had. I try not to be spoiled, but it's damn hard. Meh, I don't know anymore. I'm probably just talking out of my ass, but I guess if there is one thing I want to walk away thinking from this section of the post, it's this: Don't resent your position in society, but rather accept it and learn how to use it to not only help yourself, but as many others as you can. Never be condescending, conceited, or arrogant. Don't be an elitist, and don't act like 7/8ths of the jews you've known in so far as helping your own for unfair reasons. Oh, and of course, be fair and honest.  On a semi-related note, I should reread Ben Franklin's autobiography. That's a really good book.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Reheated it in a microwave.
