I also went through my dads entire CD collection, who knew the pops had good taste in music! WOW!? Well, save the peter paul and marry, ergah... * shivers *. But so from his collection I took two Led Zeppelin albums, all four Woodstock Albums, Tommy, by the Who, Queens greatest hits... why did I take that one? A Crosby Stills, Nash and Young CD, Hell Freezes Over by the Eagles and a Billy joel CD. I also lifted weights today, out of boredom, I really do strange things when I am .  O, I also made a fool of my self on the Celtic Connection Forum.  *sigh* I am very hapy that I did not have to go to work today, but tomorrow I go back to chaseing the little menases of our society from 8:00am till 6:00pm,  Yee Haa!
