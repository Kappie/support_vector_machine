I'm back into the heavy Gnostic stuff a bit, which has irked me a bit, until I actually go to church and realize how much I hate hearing the minister always talk about money.  It's the most annoying thing ever.  I guess the wise thing to do would be to read the great works of the Quakers Masters, but you know what?  Hearing about Christians being killed by other Christians in the name of religious freedom is far too odd for it's own good.   Yeah, Asha thing, it's over.  Amazing.  I don't think that's the core of the depression (who knows why I usually get depressed) I think it's more like a number of mental factors combining together in a plethora of wonderfulness.  Yes, SAT word.  I think it's more the cellphone crap, and Allie giving me her crazy version of AZN kill American Sars.  The itching!  I swear, I keeps spreading up and down, and I was worried it'd spread up too far on my leg, you can imagine what would happen with that.  Yeah... Okay it didn't though, it dropped back down to the bend of my knee.  Not that anyone cares about my itchy legs.
