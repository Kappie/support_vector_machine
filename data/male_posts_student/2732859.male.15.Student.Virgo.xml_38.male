Why did the Democratic Party let him speak in Prime Time thesame night of John Edwards? It was a huge mistake. He just kept going. His speech was really negative and he attacked the President and the Republican Party. He has never won an election and his career is based on a lie from almost 20 years ago. He should not have been given this time slot and if they had to let him speak it should have been during the afternoon sometime when no one is watching the convention because it is only on C-SPAN, not on C-SPAN, MSNBC, PBS, CNN, Fox News, and will be shown in part on NBC, CBS, and ABC.
