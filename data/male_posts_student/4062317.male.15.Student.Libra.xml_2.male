There was very little speech from our main character and bourne would often run around place to place not knowing who was chasing him and why. So he constantly asked the same repetative questions over and over making you want to shout out at him.      The sequal to me was not as great as the origonal but it was a good espionage movie and rather entertaining action movie. The plot could have been edited from the book it was taken from to make it bit more interesting but all in all it wasn't bad I would rate it 7.5/10     lates,     Smog
