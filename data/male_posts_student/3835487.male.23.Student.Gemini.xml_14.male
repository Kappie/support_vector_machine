Luckily I got there before she could attack, needless to say she was in her hunting crouch mode. It would have been bad if she had of attacked, because despite being nearly blind, them sunbitches is meaner 'en hell (as we would say in Oklahoma). But seriously, have you ever checked out a opossum up close? It's freaking creepy. This thing moved very slowly and I shit you not, walked straight up one side of the chain link fence and then straight back down the other. It was like the terminator of blind marsupial (it is one of those, right?).  Lit review update...17 1/2 of 18 pages to go! I'd say 1/2 a page is some sweet progress for one day! I'll try and hit a page before I go to sleep. And guys, I'm out blogging you. Rob I haven't seen shit on your blog since the ferret post, and Bobby, you copied my Q Carter post because you were devoid of any other topics to write about! You guys have been checkmated by my superior blogging abilities. Peace for now.  Alex
