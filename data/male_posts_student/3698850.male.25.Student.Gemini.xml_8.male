I just get off on admitting it and trying to deal.  You enjoy, well, not "enjoy", but you survive by supressing all of the negative things you run through your mind, or that your mind runs through you, because you are even more afraid than I am.  Every time I collapse into a horrible, self-identifying, esteem problem riddled mindset, I remember you.  And I don't feel better, I just feel welcomed.
