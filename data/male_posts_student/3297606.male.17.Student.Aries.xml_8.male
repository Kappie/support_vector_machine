There was something about today at work that made me feel uneasy. I dunno... i just wanted to leave, more than usual. oh well... its over now.  but hey! now that im off work i get to go see TROY! woo woo! mike said that i would love it, and i believe him. Any minute now an army of brads, evans, russels, mikes, and ashleys are going to rush up my doorstep and ignite the doorbell. cant wait.  Three Road has come very far, the site will be done within the week and its looking UBER! i cant wait. were gonna make this so much better than we were doing on flick films. if you see Ryan Marx, make out with him and tell him thank you (hes the guy who designed the site).  Christian Gross - HARDCORE! not the same hardcore as Jon, but hardcore as in musically. He is a hardcore kid to the max, and he is a great guitar player. I love christian with that "forbidden" love that only comes from rare fruit trees and empty logs. Christian is a sort of new addition to our elite clique, and were all so happy he could join us (sex).  current cuss word - ********* current brother watching me type this - Jonathan
