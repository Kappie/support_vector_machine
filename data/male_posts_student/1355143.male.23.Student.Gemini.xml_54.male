This day feels like dejavu, not like a crazy one just sitting in the middle of the night writing blog coz I dont want to do what Im suppose to. Its been over a month like that, at least in last month I got lucky every Friday, but things are getting better, we actually had good weather yesterday.  Since my interest in downloaded movies I watched all 24, all Friends, all American Idol and a bunch of movies.  I hope I get an interesting summer job so I come refreshed from "vacation" and school will be more fun.    Ok I have to be more upbeat, just for the record Im not depressed or anything like that Im just missing something, hope I find it soon.   I just watched American Idol the wildcard show and there is this one guy Matt Metzelder or something he reminds me of Vegard they arent look alikes but Its funny just something that reminds me of that.  From that thought I started thinking about Love actually, just jokeing Tim, my last night in Barcelona when we went to the Kareaoki bar, we all sang "We Are the Champions" or something and they had to turn of the 'mikes'.  The thing that did remind me of this night though was Vegards performance of "Eye of the Tiger" which was just classic. I hoped that Walker was on MSN so he could send it to me but he wasnt, so much for that.  I got "of my tits"in this party last Friday (if you dont believe me (which you will) she can easily confirm). I got so drunk I came home in wrong shoes, and had to go back there the day after, embarrasing.  The only good thing is that I was meaning to hit on one of the prettiest girls in the school but happily something distracted me and I didnt.  Well thats it for now, its been along time since anyone other than me and Tim have bloged so thats by I called my post ghost town. Hopefully Adam will start posting, I think that is a critical success factor here.  Well later, Ãšlli
