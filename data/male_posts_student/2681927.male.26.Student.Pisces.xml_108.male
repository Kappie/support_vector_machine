As opposed to the rest of us, who wouldn't know a value if it poked us in the eye."   --   "In short, Kerry is on to something when he says Bush does not truly stand for conservative values. On spending, trade, civil liberties, and federalism, the president has been a bitter disappointment to supporters of limited government. His main appeal to conservatives now is his backing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages - a proposal that betrays a decidedly unconservative attitude toward our founding document and the system of government it established."
