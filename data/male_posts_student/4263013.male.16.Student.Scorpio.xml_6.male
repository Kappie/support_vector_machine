And I don't care if you don't give love  back  Coz' n my heart is where your ass is at.  I love your eyes , your nose  your tender  lips,  Wanna kiss your neck, your shoulders to  your finger tips.  I go crazy when you shake those sexy hips.  Baby girl you're the 1 I can't resist.  You know I love you from the very start, I  don't care if you break my heart.  I'm the man  I'm here for you, believe me  coz' my love is true.   CHORUS  (Sashi)  Itsumo kokoro we hoshi itstuka  Dare katu mata koi nei utchitimu  Itsumo kokoro nei eiro itsumo  Anata dake no basho ga aru kara   (K9)  You wanna get down with k-n-i-n-e, make  sure that's pure l-o-v-e  Never talk about the i-c-e coz' I only got  my h-e-a-r-t for y-o-u  I can't pay the bills for dinner, I juz'  give them my IOU  For sure, I'm not after f-u-c-k, got no b- a-d intentions don't wanna play girl,  Maybe we might spot a UFO, wait, that's  not part of the rhyme juz' felt like  sayin' so  You gotta know that I love from the start  till f-o-r-e-v-e-r.   Repeat chorus   (Dice)  Baby girl be my first lady, be the mom of  my first baby  You didn't like me when you first show me,  I'll be gentle I'll do it slowly.   (K9)  Girl, I think it's better if you was with  me, I got doe coz' I juz' won the spelling  bee  For you, I got all the t-i-m-e Ask mommies  to pass but I'm not so sure  Juz' doin' my on thing, shits more  expensive than your fancy gold rings,  I don't mean dissin' coz' I gots to go  there, mommies don't care,  All for them ladies, even chicks with nose  rings.   Repeat chorus twice
