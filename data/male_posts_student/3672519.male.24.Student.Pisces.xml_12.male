He has no respect for Lance, his very own father, and insists on eating first, picking fights, and worse of all, pissing on Lance's head when they go for walks. I think that all animals overthrow their hierarchy when they come of age, but this creature is stunted! He's 2 years old but the handler at the pet shop was sure he was only all of 8 months.    Some things in the animal kingdom, however, stay the same. Lance is such a guy: he likes to play tennis balls, sleep, have sex (I'm sure), and expects only his regular meals and the occasional snack of bread, curry puff pastry and other carbohydrates. Gawain eats just for attention. Otherwise, he demands only love. The adorable little bitch.
