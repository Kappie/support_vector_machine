Been slowly moving back into attending to the things that I have been neglecting as of late and it's really quite therapeutic. It’s good to be able to kick back, address issues one at a time, and focus my attention. Guess I don't work well under pressure after all. Thought I would have that figured out by now.  And thus I now, once again, find myself at this time of the day, sitting in the dark bathed in only the illumination of my computer monitor. Except this time I'm kicking back writing this, a beer in one hand and changing CD-R's in and out of my computer while it is backing up all it's hard drives. Ahh...the Zen of living the digital life, who said beer and electronics don't mix? Just don't actually add the two together unless you want to find yourself in  Electric Dreams  .  But after so long, I still find myself suffering from that age-old holiday syndrome, where I still have to find for myself things to do or be bored out of my wits. One thing that I should do is catch up on my reading. I have these thick books to finish that are just lying around the place. Some of them are textbooks, so that’s most likely the reason why I’m so reluctant to get into them. Oh well, I will have to anyway, before things get busy again. Perhaps after I get done doing some packing that I also have been putting off, like equipment and clothing colored green…   *Yawn*  well the backup is going to finish soon, so I guess I’ll pack up here, get a nap and post this later in the morning.
