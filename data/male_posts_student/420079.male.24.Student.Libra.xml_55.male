After a week of trying to make good progress on my paper - but failing - I found myself at home last night, with about three pages complete out of a 10-12 page paper. By 6 a.m., those 3 pages were up to 4 pages. The paper was due at 12:55 p.m.  There was no way I could make it. I laid down in bed and thought, Screw it. I'll turn it in late and get my grade docked.  But I knew I couldn't do that. I had to finish this paper NOW. I had faced harder obstacles in the past. What about all the papers I wrote in college? What about the countless 40-hour production weekends at the  urlLink Michigan Review ? What about the front-page stories set to run the next day in the  urlLink Sandusky Register , which were only half-done at 8 p.m. the night before?  Now you see that I could not give up. And while evil will always triumph (because good is dumb), I had to keep going. As they may say in one of the latest shitty incarnations of the Matrix movies:  Agent Smith : Mister Schwaaaartz. You will die today.  Me : No. It is you who will die today. (fighting ensues)  Agent Smith : Your defeat... (kung fu)... is... (flying leaps)... inevitable. Why do you continue to resist?"  Me : Because I  choose  to. (Trinity kisses me) The point is, I won. I chose to keep going, and I finished the damn paper, and it was pretty good, and I drove to school and turned it in at 12:09 p.m. (there's nothing like the jolting CA-CHUNK of a time-stamp machine to remind you that whatever goes on in the Matrix has consequences in the Desert of the Real).  Okay, my laptop battery was dying so I just went to plug in my laptop and as I was bending down to find the outlet behind the bed I somehow got a paper cut on my eye. I think this a signal that I should go to sleep.  .\.\ @
