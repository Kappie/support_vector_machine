Therefore, God is the root of all evil.   Finished the Loners' Manifesto today. It was a good book, and helped explain some of my little personality quirks (such as reading, ironically). For all intents and purposes, I am a loner. While there are deviations from the rule, I still lack true interest in society at large and prefer my own society-of-two (there's always room for God, even if he is the root of all evil). One of the deviations is fellowship with my Christian fellows. While I can find solace and guidance on nature walks and in the quiet of my room, without youth group or church meetings, I would not be as far in my faith.  Finally ended the great sojourn of Alma. I turned in my check without delay after school. Now all I have to do is go.  A terrible thing happened today. I got a ticket for parking to far out into the road. Now, one of the reasons I even started this blog is to vent my anger against whatever dares to strike me the wrong way. But I can't vent against this one. The verdict is true. I thought several times that I should try parking closer to the curb, and watched with a twinge of anxiety as cars had to move around mine. I only wish the disgruntled neighbor would have talked it out with me instead of bringing the Law onto my tail. Too bad. Such is the cost of lonerdom.
