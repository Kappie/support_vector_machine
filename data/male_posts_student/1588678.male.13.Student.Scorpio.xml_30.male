Eddie Bauer supported the 40th anniversary of the climb be inviting anyone who wanted to come and watch, plus Jim was good friends with Eddie Bauer. Basically, Jim talked about the climb and had a slide show. It was pretty cool. Even though I don’t do any real mountain climbing, I thought the event was tight!   One thing about Jim Whittaker is that he has a great sense of humor. He’d make all these funny jokes and stores. One of the stores he was talking about was when he climbed the K2 Mountain in Korakoram Range, Pakistan - China Border. The K2 Mountain is the 2nd highest mountain in the world. Anyways, he and his crew got to a point where there’s a steep-ass mountain that is thin and goes straight down. Since they were on the border, Jim said to his crew, “You know, this is the one place where you can take a dump on China and pee on Pakistan.” That was great!   I really couldn’t believe my ears when he said he was 80. I mean, I didn’t know how many years its been since he climb Everest, I wasn’t even born! The guy looks like he’s in his 60s. Pretty weird, ehhh? And to celebrate the 40th anniversary, he tried climbing Mount Everest but only went about 10,000 feet. That’s pretty damn good for an 80 year old guy!   At the end of the slides and stuff he signed books so I bought one. I said hi and shook his hand and asked what it was like climbing Mount Everest. He laughed and answered me saying it was great and to follow up the answer he wrote, “Good climb.” It was cool. I’m thinking maybe going to this thing will inspire me to climb Everest. Maybe I will or maybe I’m getting ahead of myself.
