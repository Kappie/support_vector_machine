Then I made a trek to Target (grrrrr) and returned a DVD I bought (I already owned it damnit). This time I was in the store for under 60 seconds, so it wasn't so bad. :)  I also stopped by a Rite Aide to buy some soda and deodorant that were both on sale (with coupon) and my luck, the one at 12 Corners was out of both. So I continued down Monroe and found a sketchy one on Goodman and got my stuff and left as quickly as possible.  Laura came over and hung out until we were all ready to leave for the picnic. I picked up Cindy, we got on the road and got to the picnic with a couple minutes to spare. Good food: chicken breasts, salads, beans and the like. It was nice. Grandma gave me $10, Deb gave me a memory board. Mom gave me hopes of a dinner in the future.  Sophie and Grace wanted to play hide and go seek, so Deb, Laura, Cindy and I played with them. Deb was 'it' and we ran around trying to get to the home base. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me but I became so winded that I gave up trying to run and let Deb tag me. Very embarrassing. I guess I'm really out of shape. Which is depressing.  We left and went and visited Molly (who worked through the picnic) at her hot dog stand in Waterloo. We visited for awhile, Laura and Cindy got hot dogs and we eventually got on the road around 8. Laura and Cindy left and the cat and I hung out for the rest of the evening.  Monday morning came and I decided I was going to try and start a good habit... every morning I'll go and run/walk through Mt. Hope cemetery at 7am for an hour. So that's what I did, and it was nice. I built up a nice sweat and I was extremely tired after I got done. Work was nice Monday.. no bosses. I even wore a t-shirt to work.. haha. I went to the gym at noon and decided to shake up my workout... so I did the stair climber for... 30 minutes! If you've ever done the stair climber at a high rate, you'll know 10 minutes is bad enough.  Jake and I have been emailing back and forth during the day and he's given me some fatherly advice about working out, so I'm going to try a couple items he suggested (which I knew, but I need someone to tell me). You're not working out unless you're pushing yourself. As soon as it becomes easy, you need to push harder. I'd love it if I was able to run run for an hour during the morning and then push again during lunch. If I can start losing weight again I'll be more than happy to continue this. I've even begun eating the way I used to eat: 3 square meals a day, 2000 calories. Oatmeal in the morning, plenty of food during the day and a full dinner.  We'll see how it works out in the next couple weeks. Laura leaves in a couple weeks and Cindy moves in, in a couple weeks. Hopefully I can continue my routine when Cindy moves in.  Monday night I ripped a couple DVDs I got in the mail, ate a full dinner, then headed to the post office to mail them back to Netflix. I also deposited Grandma's check in my bank and also stopped by Cingular to port my number. They closed at 7, so I missed them by 2 minutes. I guess it'll have to wait until today. Laura, Cindy and Kerri all went to the mall during this time and shopped for bras. Sounds like fun. ;)  I stopped by the Central Library, returned a DVD and tried to get 2 others. However, they're 'in transit' so I'm out of luck until they arrived in the next day or so. My PDA gets returned Tuesday, so I'm looking forward to that.  This morning, I woke up and it was raining, but I went for my run through the cemetery, however, the gates were closed. I had to run down Elmwood and go in the smaller gate. Too much work just to work out. :) Now I'm at work, and this day should be just as nice as yesterday.
