Well, if you're readin this, then the answer is, YOU!  So let's begin.  So anyway, the past few nights have been very surreal for me.  I've been having lots of strange, scary, mysterious dreams.  Everything from being bitten by scorpions to finding my mother dead in bed.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Then last night I sort of brought the surrealism upon myself as I stayed up all night hell bent on fixing my computer.  And I'm sure you know what all nighters can do to a person.  I feel somewhat obliged to pull them now and then considering that I AM in college.    Today I went on an amazing date with Elenie.  She is my all time favorite person in the whole world.  The amazingness of the date was in the fact that it was 100% spontaneous.  In the middle of Vespers we lean to each other and whisper about how incredibly hungry we are, and hey let's go eat afterwards.  Well, just eats turned into eats, walking around, listening to music, and seeing a movie.  Brilliant.     Today I also met with Alex M. the outgoing HCHC SGA president.  What a fine man he is.  Such wisdom and knowledge.  Very insightful.  I wish I could have him by my side throughout the year.  But I can't.  It's my turn.  I have an amazing executive board.  Completely competent and ready to man the frontlines if I asked them to.  Wow.  To have authority over people like that is something I always wanted to experience.  Now that I have it, I feel a sense of duty to cherish it and protect it.  We are going into battle.  Make no mistake.  Some of you won't come back alive.  (more coming soon....)
