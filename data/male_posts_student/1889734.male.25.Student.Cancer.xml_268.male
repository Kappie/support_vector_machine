Mark asked how could Al Sharpton be allowed to host SNL this weekend without triggering the equal time clause for public candidates.  Here is my reply.  There are five exceptions to the equal time clause - Newscasts, on the spot breaking news, documentaries, political conventions, and news interviews.   But:  If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section.   Since SNL is 'censoring' the content by scripting the sketchs and the monologue, and they are not 'campaigning' in the sense of advocating policy issues, they are clear.  If they gave Al an open forum to speak as he wished for an amount of time, then it becomes a campaign, and the clause is triggered.  Shows like Leno have been categorized as News Interviews, so the Gropenator can get on there and say whatever he wishes without triggering an equal time rule.  I don't believe that the airing of Ahnuld films in CA would have triggered this clause, but they pulled them anyway.
