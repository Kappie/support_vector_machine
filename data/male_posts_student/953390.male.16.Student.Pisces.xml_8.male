As you can see by my little 'about' section, I am on the Southwest District 4-H Senior Board of Directors. Anyway, we had our get-to-know-each-other Ice Cream Social last weekend. We are all deciding nicknames for our jerseys. I like 'Jigga' (don't ask), and this cool chick named Laura, under my suggestion, is doing 'Freek-A-Leek.' But I just thought that maybe we can do that whole Spears/Timberlake thing. She could be 'Pinky' (which is appropriate considering she loves pink) and I'd be 'Stinky' (even though I am not, it's cool). It'd be innocent fun. I had some Mexican food last night. I was in taste ecstacy, considering I'd been  craving  it for 2 weeks. Oh, and we have exams next week. AAAAAAHHHHH! I am so scared about my math exam. I stink so bad at Algebra. Why would they make me take that crap, anyway? I'm going to be a reporter. Where would I use that at the anchor's desk, may I inquire?
