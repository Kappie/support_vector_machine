First off, I've decided I hate the entire class of '06 with the exception of like 5 people. One of those rising juniors who I considered a close friend is treating me like shit and I've just been coming back over and over like a dumb dog. Anyways, the last straw was after I have been treating her nicer than almost all of my friends she posted things on her blog (and quiz) that make me come up as a sex-obsessed immature pervert, that's not worth anyone's time. Not only that, but I'm sick of the unearned criticisms that she dishes out at me every time we talk, after all I do is give her compliments. Anyways, if she ever wants me to even consider her a friend again, she has a hell of a lot of apologizing to do. I'm so sick of people like that.....  Anyhow, on a lighter note, I will make an audio post with Cassy as soon as I can get through to her. Also, the last quiz is now invalid, as the question on who I like no longer applies (in fact, it should be rephrased to, "Who have I lost all respect for and is a backstabber?") Well, that's it for now. I'm out....
