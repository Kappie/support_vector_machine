Anyway, I had this dream during one of my naps, and I still remember every detail of it. I'm amazed. I never remember my dreams, haha. I was worried that I didn't dream at all anymore because I wake up without a thought in my mind.        So this dream started out with me at some fast food restaurant with Mom, and she was ordering something while I was watching the TV tuned to FoxNews connected to the ceiling (you know how some places have TVs situated like that, lol). So the newsperson started discussing some princess (who for some reason lived in Los Angeles) who'd been killed by her new husband. It caught my eye because I remembered all the commotion made about their marriage a few weeks earlier.        As the news guy started to describe how she was allegedly killed, Mom grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of the restaurant. She said "You don't need to know what happened." I was obviously taken aback. How'd she know what happened? And why would she not want me to know?        Anyway the rest of the dream is a little foggy. All I can recall is that the whole thing was basically about me trying to find out how she was killed, and my mom finding clever ways to stop me. There was some dramatic ending, and I woke up just as I was about to discover the details of her death. I hate when that happens...
