Is like running down a hill, so fast everything's a blur and at the end you just look out for a rock on the road, hoping not to fall. That's life. The rush of it seems to take its toll with time.  But we are so used to be this fast passed beings that slowing down is just out of the question, and if you tried to, nature won't allow it in an easy way. Be happy to have a family to lean on, friends that care.
