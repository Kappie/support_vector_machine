I am geting the computers and video equipment ready for the Football game friday. It's away, but we have to go film it. Something happened today with a special video conference computer today. I opened it up to talk the hard drive out (to format it from NTFS to FAT32 for Win98) and when I was done the BIOS said "WARNING! Computer case opened". I have never seen that before - strange.   It's hot in school like normal. I am sweeting just seating down. I guess school won't be bad this year, having to free periods.   Had someone from Leoville E-mail me today. His name was Eric, the Webmaster of www.ericville.com. I think that it was so neat finding someone with the same intrestes and the same name. He is in 6th grade up one state in Michigan. I usally post at Leoville's Mob section @ http://leoville.textamerica.com (I think). I love watching TechTV's The Screensavers. It's the best geek show out there.  That's all the time right now.
