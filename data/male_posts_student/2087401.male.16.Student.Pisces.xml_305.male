Incase we have any uncultured whelps reading this blog, he plays the cello.  He plays it well.  Hurray for Momas who got tickets to see Yo Yo Ma!  If there's anyone here who doesnt know who Momas is, she is the mother of Thomas.  Mom + Thomas = Momas.    Then I came home.  Then I went away again.  Off to Christin Neary's birthday party.  Good food. Lots of people. and notice the sentence fragmens? Good device. Will be used more later.  Anywhy, parts of it were fun, other bits tasted good.  However, there was quite a bit of negative-marten energy there, so I was, for the most part, canceled out.  Sounds silly, but what can I do?  After that, Big Fish. It was fun. See What Kind of day has it been.   michael what did I say about using the word props?  This blog depicted here shall possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works. Bind them with fury, a burning anger unless prevented at vulgar cost, this blog will render the greatest power unto utter desolation.
