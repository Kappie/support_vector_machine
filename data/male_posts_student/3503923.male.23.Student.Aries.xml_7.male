The trolley-pushing position at your local Supermarket is one of prestige, a celebrated mantle only entrusted to those with finely tuned personalities, capable of seeing beyond the monotony, being able to rise above mediocrity. I have now joined this elite band of people. Infiltrated their ranks, carrying out the most sophisticated piece of ethnographic research on the psyche of the lowly trolley-boy. I'm only serving my apprenticeship, gingerly stepping onto the first rung of the career ladder, knowing that many intensive months of rigorous tuition is to follow. There are mentors, role-models, masters, and surrogate Father's aplenty. All eager to impart some knowledge, knowledge of worth, of worth in my steep ascent into the higher reaches of portering fame. You may have to ask your misconceptions to leave politely, after I reveal to you how the work of a trolley-boy is not for the Simpleton. Years of bad-mouthing, negative stereotyping, and wild generalizations, have left this earnest servant of the community, buried underneath the rubble of shame to suffer in anonymity. Let's reveal the true beauty, and silent wisdom of the trolley-boy trade.  Glenn is no mug. At 37, he is pushing trolleys for a living at Asda, he does it part-time, earning enough to maintain his rotting holiday home that he bought for Â£7000 some 7 years ago. His passion is script-writing, he is a real film buff, knowing absolutely everything about films, apart from those awkward first questions that you fail at because of stage-fright and performance pressure. "Go on, ask me anything about films, I now the lot." "Who won the male Oscar in 1979?" "Ahh, well, let me think..." Sadly, Glenn faltered a little, unable to answer the question, his face-saving mechanism kicked in and he reeled off numerous amazing impersonations. De Niro, Eastwood, The slithering tongue Hopkins from Silence of the Lambs. I knew the lines, but all I could hear was Glenn. For Glenn, Asda is the soap, the ongoing drama in his life. He loves to talk, he'll gossip all day. About short Scott who superglued the green cupboard shut, yet protesting his innocence while holding the tube of superglue in his hand standing right beside that very same green cupboard. About the workman who was sick in the bin. About affairs and real life, interests peculiar, fishing tales, and cinematic fables. Glenn is not mad about trolleys, he has things in perspective.  Gerald the greeter, a retired engineer, is nifty with his hands. He blessed me with my most important tool as trolley-boy, the key. He fiddled away with old discount cards, the aforementioned superglue, and a sharp pair of scissors, and in no time I was the proud owner of my very own trolley release key. He proceeded to take me through a crash course in releasing techniques, or should I say technique. "You put the key in the hole, like so, and there we have it. Now you try!" In, Out. "Could you just run that through with me one more time?" After watching the training video in class for the fourth time, Gerald finally let me loose on the trolleys. I tell you how it works. You know the light switch...  Brian 'keep on the move or management will spot you', shows me the places where to pick litter from, by knowing which way the wind blows, he finds me some great spots. The most frequently picked up piece of litter is the fag butt, this saddens me. Wealth gone wrong. Brian tells me the legal requirements for trolley-pushing. Only allowed to push up to eight at a time. I obey. He abhors talking, only respecting the real workers. He keeps on warning me about the management Sharks who monitor your movements. "They're watching! "Up on the gangway, in the office, cigarette room, and on camera, keep moving boy!" I assure him that I have the capacity to work, but he shrughs at my suggestions of improving team morale by getting to know each other. "I never talk about my family." Brian came out of retirement to be active. He hates standing still, his knees ache, so he keeps on the move, for the sake of exercise and the fear of exposure. I want to share the gospel, so I have to talk, It's my duty, a duty of love, I speak words that are not mine, the most life transforming words in the world, they cut into you like a sword, sometimes the sword hits granite and bounces back, other times it reaches flesh, and the love of Jesus moves in.  Glenn, Gerald, Brian and I agree on some things. It is detestable to see anybody try to nick a trolley, however fun they are down the high street, however many barbecue grills you can get out of one, and however aesthetically pleasing they are to the eye. The caster-lock, super-clamp, electronic gizmo wizardry, halts any scoundrel as they reach the magnetic boundary lines that activate the yellow lock that encircles the wheels. The brakes are on, and thou shall turns into thou shall not. We rejoice! I ask of you. See in the next trolley boy you meet: A humble servant.
