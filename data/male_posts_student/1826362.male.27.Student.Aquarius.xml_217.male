I followed the recipe almost exactly (water instead of chicken stock) but it came out tasting like spaghetti.  it was very bland.  now I think that part of the problem might be the water for broth substitution, but I added some salt to try to compensate.  but the point being that I'm not a novice cook.  I'm actually pretty good at making most things.  But this failed spectacularly.  It's not that it was bad, just very boring, and very un-pad thai-like.  anyone know how to make a man pad thai  come teach me. alternately, anyone want to come over for lunch? I'm having leftover pad thai.
