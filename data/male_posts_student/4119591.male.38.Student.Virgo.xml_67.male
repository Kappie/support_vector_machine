Unfortunately, now that I look at my web site, I think it looks like garbage by comparison.   No time to worry about that just now though. I've got a final philosophy paper to write and a psychology project to wrap up. Soon summer term will be at an end and I'll be able to frolic in the sunshine for a couple of weeks before fall semester starts. Oh joy is mine.
