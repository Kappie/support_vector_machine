Just a normal day, I don't know why but I payed good attention in school today. In track, I had to run 2 miles from SHS to Jeroke and back and after that I had to run 5 800's (2.5 miles). It was a long practice until 5:10. I took the bus home with Pat and Paul and other people and Paul was upset because there was no ice cream in my ice to make milk shakes. The poor child was looking foward to it all day. "Tom make sure the ice cream is kosher." Damnit, how do you spell that word? I got the new Zelda game, it's pretty cool, who cares if it's cartoon, the game is good. Link is funny looking. Most of you haven't a clue what I'm talking about... but that's ok, you're only missing out on the best games ever... besides for first person shooters. I had no homework, it was awesome. Now I gotta put a bunch of songs onto my MD (portable mp3) so I can listen to Linkin Park's new songs on the bus tomorrow. By the way, Linkin Park's new cd, Meteora was released in stores today. Ok, goodnight.
