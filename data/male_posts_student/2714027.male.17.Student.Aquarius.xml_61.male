A friend of mine had his first date with the girl from the party (the one he swept away from me) today, and a group of friends and I went down to town before them for a coffee. Earlier in the day, him and I were just casually joking about it as other people said, "Hey Phil, so-and-so is going out with your bird today!". I corrected them that she wasn't "my bird", although I told myself, "not yet anyway!" I've been trying to keep chatting my my mate as much as normal, so it doesn't look like I'm bitter and grumpy, which I'm not really.  Anyway, we left the coffee place before they went past, so I went to the bus stop. It was near to the place they were going for their date, but I didn't reckon on seeing them go past, so just waited for a bus. The bus came and on I got, and just as I sat down, I saw them. They didn't see me through the bus window and the bus moved off quickly, obscuring my view.  It was the first time since the party that I've seen her and she looked slightly different. Maybe it was the expression on her face in those few seconds or the effect of alcohol at the party affecting my vision, I don't know. She still looked just as good though, her fiery red hair and curvy body moving up the street like a dream. I just wish it were me beside her.  As the bus went on, I started to think about her again, and the whole incident at the party. In mid-thought, I started to listen in on the conversation that a couple of women behind me were having. It was pretty boring stuff, but made me think just how lucky I am. While they talk of their jobs cleaning offices late at night for low wages, I look forward to a gap year, university and a decent career afterwards. My life isn't really as bad, so I told myself to stop moaning and groaning about some girl.  I'm not over her just yet and it's going to be interesting to hear about what happened on the date tomorrow, but "there are plenty more fish in the sea" and I have a gap year and uni coming up, which are both large aquariums in their own right.  Time will tell, I guess...   P.S. Kill Bill Volume 1 rocks!
