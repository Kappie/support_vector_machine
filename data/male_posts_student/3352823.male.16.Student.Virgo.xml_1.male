It's funny like how great cinema can be. I mean my favourite movie of all time is "Pulp Fiction" by the mastermind Quentin Tarantino (this site is named after a very famous scene), but that movie is about  shit . Now when I say  shit  I mean nothing. It's not actually about poo. Really. Go rent it now. But anyway, "Pulp Fiction" has no plot, and yet it appeals to me because I love those characters and the words they say. It's magic. The first time I saw it I was like "Wow... This is pretty cool." Then thought nothing of it; I did want to see it again though. This was last... October. Then I started reading about it and thinking about how great some of the things in it are. And then it hit me "Wow." And with that I was hooked and started to devote myself to movies. I love movies. But it's sad because I've only just gotten into them heavily so I've missed a time of movies. Then again, for most of the nineties I was an uber-geek. I still am now. And geekhood has just become attractive (God bless you Seth Cohen), so I should be raking in girls. Not literally of course... That would be stupid. I'd need a net or something of that nature. A rake'll get you nowhere.   This weekend has been... Procrastination City. Population: Me. All I've done is put stuff off. I'm doing it now! But, I did get a project finished. I just have to do some review, read a book and do some simple history sheets. Not hard at all. The book I have to read is called "The Great Gatsby" and it has the plot with an interest level equivalent to watching paint dry. It's as dull as brass. That being said, there is a lot of different circumstances in it. "What the heck is he saying?!" Well, it's set in (and was written in) the 20's, so it's neat to see how people acted during that era. It's like stepping back in time... A magical ride... *Dodges incoming projectiles* Hem.   I had marmalade today for the first time in a long time. Yum.   S'all for now.
