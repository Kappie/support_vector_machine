Today at school was more than typical - meaning that everything was only more the same than it was before. Same people bugging me, same people I find myself getting angry at, same people I quietly find remorse for, regardless for the fact that I never yell at them.  I'm sure a lot of the people that read this (I actually never knew or intended for people to read this) think I'm a person-hating angry-man who finds seclusion in the dark corners of the world. Do I like solitude? Yes, I do. Do I like being alone. Sure I do. Do I like talking to people? Yeah, I do. But no, I don't. I'll talk to people, but I don't usually like prolonged social stimulation. I know I sound really "lame" and anti-social, but trust me, I'm not really like that. I just prefer my own kind of situation, which in itself makes no sense at all. That's okay, I like things that way.  I'm tired. I'll write more about this tomorrow. Sorry.
