We went to the fourth floor, the Teens section. Wah liew! So much space to meow and moo! HaHa. We went to sit at the red couch...then we left our bags to go print the microfilm copy of the article we wanted. Sigh...the printer is spoilt, and I have to go to Woodlands Library to print. Anyway, I am gonna collect my book. So meow!  We went out to eat. We ate at KFC. Kelvin joined us. GekLing drank medium Coke, KL a regular Moutain Dew. Me and JiaHao ate the Buddy Meal. HaHa! He said I was very meticulous. I ordered everything to the specific. Like the chicken parts must be wings and drumsticks. Heh. Must order everything you like to eat ma. Yeah. We ate lor.  After eating, we went back to discuss. We shifted to a corner. Well, it was my first time taking minutes. HaHa. I didn't put who contributed what...because all the points were contributed by everyone! Sigh..if need be, I will try to remember.   Well, the discussion went quite well. We discussed our project plan briefly. The detailed one will be discussed at the next meeting. Yes. We ended at 4:30. Me and Kelvin went back. Well, I went off at Woodlands to meet CQ, Gloria and WQ at the library. I am showing CQ an article we found in the microfilm.   Well, I went to collect mah book. After a long time of searching, I finally got to borrow the book! YAY! What a fun book to read!   Okay. Darn it! The printing person went for dinner and is only coming back at 6! Meow moo! I read my book lor, until 6.30. Heh. I finally went to look for the printing lady at 3rd floor and invited her down. I finally printed the pages..and another page 27 for WQ. The font is quite small, but still can see la. CQ don't need that article. Oh meow.   We went to accompany Gloria to buy food (and I brought a single Egg Sushi, which almost caused WQ to faint). Then we went home. I bathed and ate chicken rice, read a bit of Cowell and came online.  Oh god! Joyce called! She's angry at me (well, not really..she was joking) for telling CQ and Gloria stuff. Yeah...me and my big mouth la. I seem to be offending EVERYONE this week! The horoscopes didn't even warn me about it! Sheesh!!  Right. Oh yes! Good luck to JiaHao in his Taekwondo tournament tomorrow! Right. I shall end this blog le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
