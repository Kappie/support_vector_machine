I will probably paint the bathroom, but it remains to be determined.  As I am still shaking off the dust of subconsciousness, I do not feel I am in a reliable place, mentally, to start making decisions.  I should probably sit here and babble with my fingers until I have the confidence to decide which room to paint first, even though they will all eventually be painted.  Life is full of hard decisions, and that's an important lesson for everybody to learn.  It is easy to criticize others for decisions that appear foolish when we have the luxury of retrospect.  In history, all things become clear... but in the present, reality is often presented to us in a swirling mass of uncertain possibilities... we should respect others that make mistakes, not only because we ourselves will eventually make mistakes, but because we should respect mistake-making in general.  Mistakes are bound to happen -- we should be aware that things will go wrong, and not be surprised when they do.  So in that vein, I think I'll paint the bathroom today.  Sure, it might mean the deaths of thousands, but how am I to know that know?  You'll all just have to forgive me!  The next decision to make is in regards to the music I will listen to... and that's fairly easy.  I'll listen to funk, soul, and some low-down dirty blues... and then I'm going to rock out with some rawk!  But what if these are mistakes?  What if some of my neighbors are trying to meditate?  What if I have a sick neighbor that is trying to sleep?  Well, then I'll be making a mistake, and THEY'LL have to live with it!  Hey, I make mistakes!  Deal with it!  After that, I'll have to take a shower.  But will I turn on the hot water first, or the cold water first?  They will have to mix eventually so I neither scald nor freeze myself in the shower, but which do I turn on first?  I'll probably start with the cold... but what if I'm wrong?  What if I should start with the hot water?  Will my cat die?  No, so I don't care.  And then I have to wear clean clothes.  What if I'm not stylin'?  Heh heh heh, I think we can safely rule out THAT possibility.
