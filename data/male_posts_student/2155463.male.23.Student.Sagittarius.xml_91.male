I have to admit, it was really nice to be back working again; it might seem nice to have time off and all, but after a while it gets really depressing and ambivalent.  And it was really nice that the folks there seemed to incorporate me very nicely (considering I was "only a temp"); by the second day I was there I was doing a lot of the same projects and responsibilities as the person I was sitting in for.  Of course, now that Spanish starts next week I'm without a job again.  Hopefully something will come up, but I'm thinking that if nothing does I might just try to do the internship with the Cleveland Public Defender.  I have to admit that since I got back from DC I've really missed the purposefulness that the internship with PDS had; I mean, what I was doing there really had an impact on people's lives, and I just don't want to go back to "pushing paper."  Of course, I'm feeling kind of down about things in general right now.  I think that Switchfoot had it right when they said it's all about "Life and Love and Why" - life is really nothing but the way we live, the way we love, and why we do so.  And right now I feel really empty.  I don't know if it's the fact that it's summer or having Jay and Melissa around all the time or just a phase, but I've been feeling really lonely lately.  But at the same time it just doesn't seem like I have any hope for things to turn around or change; I mean, it takes me so freaking long to get close to people, and I'm not very outgoing, and I just don't really see why anyone would care to like me right now.  I think that the way that I'm constantly looking for a purpose is a very good thing about me, but at the same time I think that it precludes me from seeing things in other healthy ways.  I guess the source of it all is that I just don't seem to have any joy in anything.  I see other people who have celebrations and fun because they're graduating from college and all (and people who did so WHILE they were in college), and I'm just not like that.  I mean, there just isn't that kind of joy about it in me; college was one task, and now it's time to move on to the next.  And that's pretty much the way things are for me, both in the miniscule and the general; life is nothing but going from task to task, and if I don't have a task or a goal then life ceases to have meaning.  And that just seems so empty, maybe even nihilistic.  The saying "Stop and smell the roses" comes to mind.  I mean, if you think about it, how many flowers do we pass by on the road every day and are just going too fast to even be able to get a whiff of the fragrance they emit?  And that's the way it seems like my life is right now; in some area it seems like things are moving so slowly (especially the social realms), but in general it seems like I'm hurtling along a set of railroad tracks about ready to enter a tunnel - I can already see the light at the other end, but I have no idea what that light illuminates.  And I'm wondering if maybe I shouldn't stop the train for a while and just walk, to take time to enjoy life instead of hurtling by everything.  Of course, that sounds wonderful, but I don't even know if I could do it if I tried.  As horrible as this might sound, if I tried to slow things down I bet I would only get frustrated and depressed - I'm not going to change who or how I am in any brief period of time, and the frustration of trying to do so would be so painful that I don't know if it's worth it.  Maybe this is just the way I'm supposed to be; one of the things that I've realized is that there are just different types of people in the world, and maybe I'm simply getting discontent because I'm wishing I was someone that I'm not.  But on the other hand, maybe this is something that I know I need and I'm just afraid of failing to reach it.  Anyway, it just seems like things are kinda blaise right now.  And I don't know why - as has been the case so many times in my life, if I were to look at things objectively (i.e. "on the face of things") I don't really have any reason to be so down: I have a full-ride scholarship to law school, I don't have so many economic pressures that being without a job for a while is going to put me in any sort of financial disaster, I have a proximate and relatively caring family (both close and extended), I am involved in quite a few "community activities" (church, basketball, softball, volleyball, etc.), I'm graduating from college summa cum laude (whatever grade I get in my summer class isn't going to affect my GPA), and it would probably appear on the outside that I'm not in any sort of emotional or physical distress.  But all of that is objective, and one of the things I've been learning over the last couple of years is that the "objective" view of things is very often not as objective as it claims to be.  So relatively speaking from my own point of view, it seems like my life is going nowhere right now.  One of the things that I like to say is that I'm a relational person, but this is absolutely not true; relationships might motivate me (even highly superficial ones), but in reality I have so few real relationships that I hardly remember what one is (and the memories of it/them are something I try to avoid because they only accentuate my current perception of loneliness).  And I don't know whether this is my fault or a byproduct of my past or just the way things are; probably a little of all these.  But I know that the end result is that I don't have any relationships and I don't know how to get any, and the sum of this is the feeling that I'm pretty much destined to be alone.  And it also scares me to think of what might happen if I do develop a relationship - I mean, I don't know how to "hold up my end of the deal," which inevitably ends up with whatever relationships I have falling apart (or simply dissolving).  So it's really a lose-lose-lose situation; I don't feel that I'm very appealing to be in a relationship with, I don't feel able to begin a relationship myself, and I'm scared that whatever relationship I might develop will invariably not last.  Wow, I am SUCH an optimist :P  Of course, I wonder why I even write this stuff on here at all; I doubt that anyone even reads it, and I'm sure that if anyone is and they've gotten to this point of this blog they're wondering why I'm such a prick.  I guess I put it on here because it's somewhat cathartic; I don't have anyone to talk to about these things in real life, and I've been holding things in for my entire life and that hasn't gotten anything any better, so maybe it's just a defense mechanism to keep from getting too bitter about things (it's better to be melancholy than mean, right?).  So I guess this blog is my own pseudo-shrink; after all, isn't basically what shrinks do is sit there and listen?  So what better than to talk to everyone and no one at the same time?
