I had the weirdest dream ever. I can't talk about it tho... haha...i messed up the spelling there and it said 'tit ho'  ack everything in life revolves around sex. I hate it. I hate life. I hate everything. I hate living. I hate showers cut short. I hate child abusers. i hate killers. i hate rapists. I hate runaway fathers. I hate waking up early. I hate tears. I hate other people crying. I hate feeling like shit. I hate popups. I hate feeling inadequate. I hate being alone, while everyone else int he world seems to be happily with someone, or at least wanted by someone...  Let's go over recent times anyone has cared for me. in thatish way. dec 29.....omyra. and then i had to leave. and i probably wont see her for a long time...before that. umm.....yes, the musical. that redhead girl. that lasted what 2 days? she cried about breaking up with me, i know im a little special? before that...7th grade. whitney. the one from school not kobey. 3 weeks. hm..............................................  ........feels pathetic and inadequate. and depressed. and longing....  my sister is smoking hooka with kim and some of her muslim friends. well, technically theyre having a kickback er something. but kims an arab blonde, her parents dont care if she gets high on the hooka. so go for it.  and im here. still. just here. alone.  aisha is grounded for 2 weeks for some moronic reason. crap. so that means......lets see....i wont have much to do for a while, will i? no. i wont. not that im usually really popular and out there. party-not.  brighton is sleeping with dj tonight i think. that brightens me up.   i forgot to write baout aisha up there ^^^^...sorry? lol  CRAP i need to switch this music. its whats depressing me.   It actually feels good to write..I ahd been dreading it, cause i didnt want to, but now its better. i havent wanted to write for a while. so this is good.   but i have to go...my dad will think im constipated (i ran to the bathroom and then came here)  who am i kidding? ill stay a little longer...    alright.  much love  peace  ~alex
