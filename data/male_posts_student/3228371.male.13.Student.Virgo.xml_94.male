When I can't see him, I'll have the next best thing... TALK TO HIM! Hee hee~ So yeah... I was late for guitar class but it was okay. We did some different riffs and stuff with different chords and crap.  I came back and saw an email from Candace. Read it. It was one of the blah-est emails I've ever received. By blah, I don't mean it in a bad way. I guess it's a good thing that she read that in my blog. She says she's gonna change and I have faith in her. She said sorry and stuff but I guess I'm the one to say sorry and also THANK YOU. I really should've been honest with her about how I felt about things and when I wanted to tell her, I just chickened out so my bad~ The THANK YOU is for getting me to realize that it would've been a lot better if I just did what I should've done in the first place. I guess P.U.S.H. is even true-er than I thought.  Never underestimate GOD!  The lesson of the day~  Yeah, and I guess it was my bad after school... I got Jeremy to go buy ice-cream for me (a small twist cone... yummy!). Blah... Nima wanted to go but I didn't want him to, so yeah... I only got Jeremy to go because I was too lazy to get up from my seat! HAHA! Lazyness~ So yeah... plus, I didn't want Nima to go... I wanted him to stay right there beside me~ ^^   Well, to be honest... I've got something to say. Something that I know a lot of girls do subconciously and probably will NEVER admit. I know one who's admitted it and I admit it too! To be totally honest, I've done some pretty blah stuff that I know that I probably shouldn't have done. Sometimes, it just seems like Nima doesn't know I'm there... like he doesn't see me or whatever. So I start talking to some other guy (not flirting, but TALKING) and I guess that's self-explanatory as to WHY I start talking to some guy. DUH! Attention! I know... it's gay, but you know what? Whoever's reading this (IF YOU'RE A GIRL), I know that you do it too! I KNOW IT! Don't try to deny it! 99% of the population of average girls do that! Blah... It's just... something I know that I do subconciously and then feel bad about. Haha... gayness... Blah~ See what I mean? I'm such a bratty little girl! BRAT  PROUD! ^^" Anywayyyy, Moca's probably going like: "Daaaaa bine" HAHA! So yeah... That's me. My thoughts. My crap. My bullshit. So shut up! Haha~ Joking. Dude, I love blogging. Allows me to type stuff I'd never say out loud! Whoohoo!   Thank you guys for listening~ Wuv y'all~~~
