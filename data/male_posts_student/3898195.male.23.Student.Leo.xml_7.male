Windows XP is starting to get on my nerves... It's having problems with any type of Unicode files. It would crash on spot if it encounters any files have name consisting of Unicode and/or the content have Unicode characters. Right now I can't even back up some of my media files because of Unicode. This is not the only problem. I can't even install WinRAR without it crashing within few seconds of activation of installation. How weird!!!    Well, I'm backing up my stuff now and going to back up those 'problem' files in Linux. Tomorrow I'm scratching this and starting fresh with Windows XP. I'm so fed up with Windows weird anomaly problems!
