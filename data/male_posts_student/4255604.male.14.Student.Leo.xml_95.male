Ordinatrix is actually a non-competitive event and though they encourage you to make and bring both web sites and movies for their Web Designing and Movie Making events, they say that even if you don't make and bring, you can go there and learn because they will be calling experts from each field and conducting workshops.    Exun members who are interested in going for Ordinatrix to learn Web Designing or Movie Making, please post your names in the comments.    --Karan
