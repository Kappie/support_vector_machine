So the other day I went to my grad . . . as part of the audience, I didnt have all that much fun though. It made me feal really sad to see all my friends again who I wont be seeing for a long time, and I slammed my bottom pierce off of a wall and it bled like crazy. After that though I got to have fun at a party, where everyone was drunk except for me and the guy I was hanging out with. I dont really know why I said I was having fun . . . because I really wasnt, so my friend and I took off to his place and went to bed. Fun grad night, eh? (props to canada)      Still I feal like Im a car . . . and the gas guage is on "E", its not even that I dont have alot of energy, I guess its the same old story . . . . not having any motivation, or goals or anything. Though quite recently things have been getting a bit better it seems, people around me are in this downward spiral and they are all feeling down, and my life is finally starting to look up . . . . well not really up, but at least I have more confidence. Now that my ex and I have broken up, I'm starting to notice alot of girls coming after me . . . its not that I don't like it, its just that its kinda overwhelming at first . . . especially those few girls that seem kinda creepy at times, they're REALLY overwhelming. (Dont worry, Im not talking about you.)       One of my old friends from out of town is coming for Canada Day weekend, I hope she brings a shred of happiness with her, and I hope even more that it rubs off on me. I feel so lonely sometimes, and she always seems to shake that feeling away, so lets hope it works again. I'm not sure what else I can write here this morning . . . . But I'll try to rant a little more often for those of you who care.       Happy Hoppin Canada Day, you freak.           -Forgotten
