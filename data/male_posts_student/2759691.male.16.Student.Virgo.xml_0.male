Gen Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has announced that, although his country will still be part of the so-called  urlLink coalition of the willing , it will end military support for the occupation of Iraq. Uganda, a country which spends a shocking $120 million on its military every year, will withdraw its only troop from the country on June 1. "I feel proud to have represented Uganda in Iraq," said the unidentified soldier, "but my brothers really miss me." Although there was no immediate response from the White House, it is certainly a blow to the already streched-out U.S. military. The troop has not been identified for security purposes.
