Those of ER, the West Wing, and Will and Grace were probably the best.    In the "premiere" of Model UN, Matt K-K (Japan) and I wrote a resolution condemning NNHS renovations (the school is fine).  It failed, but we only got to read the preambulatory clauses, which aren't very important.  I got Russia, the largest country in the world, one of the former Superpowers, and a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power.  The next issue is nucleics, both weaponry and energy. Russia seems to have a strong opinion on the former, advocating the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty). Only nine more countries need to ratify the treaty for it to become universal, and Russia aims to commit them to it. I don't know what my opinion should be on nuclear energy though, because it doesn't really seem to be a debatable topic. Stay tuned for a resolution on nuclear weapons.    Saturday and Sunday were Rosh Hashanah, or as Josh Magid slurs it, "Rushana." I walked to and from an Orthodox Temple both days; Since we couldn't blow it on Shabbat, on the second I heard the shofar.     That's pretty much it- everyone vote for my resolution, coming soon.     P.S. Here are two recent quotes from my history teacher, Ms. Heidlage:     "Do put in your input."    "You can make as many transactions as you want...up to five...per round."    -You will have a loss for every transaction you do not make.   -You mean, a loss of nothing?  -Yes.    So really there were three.
