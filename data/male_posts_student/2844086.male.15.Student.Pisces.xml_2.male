Even as I write this I'm trying to get back to life, which is hard after what I just experienced. I am so in awe of God right now. I just realize that I am nothing. I don't even deserve to worship the Lamb upon the throne.  Yesterday while I was listening to Dr. David Jeremiah's "Escape the Coming Night" series, I was just drawn to the song, "We All Bow Down". And I listened to it, and now I'm hooked. This song just reminds me of when all the elders in the book of Revelation fall down and worship the one who sits on the throne.   We All Bow Down  Lenny LeBlanc  Princes and paupers, Sons and Daughters Kneel at the throne of grace Losers and winners, saints and sinners One day will see His face  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God  Summer and Winter, the mountains and rivers Whisper the Savior's name Awesome and Holy, a friend to the lonely Forever His love will rain  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God  He is the Light of the world And Lord of the Cross  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God
