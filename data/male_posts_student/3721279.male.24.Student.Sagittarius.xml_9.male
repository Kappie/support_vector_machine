Shall we find the ruined, broken bodies of slain dragons trailed behind him? Did he conquer Spain? Did he clean the bathroom? Has he got a freakin' haircut yet?!  Sadly, none of those things are true. Wait...no I  did  clean the bathroom, and what a venture that was. But in my week long absence, I did do and see things worth writing about, and I'm sure that there are even more things before then that I could have mentioned. So, where to begin?  I've been threatened, shot, borrowed, educated, frightened, angered, offered, irritated, and have made outstanding achievements in clumsiness, placed my roommates and some friends in mortal danger, and even consumed two mochas in the course of a few hours. How did all of this happen you ask?  Well, most of it can be summed up by playing paintball, engaging in a few good hours of wholesome Dungeons  Dragons, and catching a showing of Fahrenheit 9/11. The rest we can leave up to imagination....  As my totally anonymous poster (who would of course most definitely  not  be my roommate Robb) stated, I have been busy at ye olde Stop of Games, as it seems that all of my coworkers are either hospitalized, on vacation, missing in action, getting ready to ship out for this years Otacon (I hope I spelled that wrong), or just choose not to pick up their phones when they know the store is calling them for potential help. The money will be good, that's for sure. During the course of this rigorous tour of duty against the vile and immeasurably large forces of video game consumers, I received what I consider to be my first real challenge to a fight, by probably one of the most worthless human beings in the tri-state area. Had I not been on the clock and dressed so formally, I might have taken the opportunity to make an even bigger fool of him.....or at least that's what my imaginary, conscienceless, extremely  confident badass persona thinks. Yeah, moving on.....   Fahrenheit 9/11.  I don't care who you are, and I don't care what you believe in. Go see this film immediately. Enough said.  I have one of the most disgusting bruises I have ever seen on my right shoulder. I got it from taking some blind fire (naughty) during one of the last few games of paintball I played on Sunday. Now, I'm not a big paintball fan. I enjoy it, true enough, but I'm no junkie. Still, it was a fairly awesome day of brightly colored forest warfare, and the exercise was much needed. I took special pleasure in lighting up a guy on the other team who mentioned the highlight of the game for him was shooting women and children. However, it would have been nice to have been able to walk like a normal person for the three days following. Rocky hillsides = the doom of Dave's quads.  Egads, there's been so much to talk about. I'm sure I've left out  so many things , but I'll try to be more frequent in my postings. I honestly just got so wrapped up in other stuff, that when I sat down at the computer, I didn't have the energy to write. I've been very tired lately, but that's what I have mochas for. (drool)  A potential job opportunity was sent my way by my favoritestest professor and psyc mentor Dr. Kelly. Apparently she thinks I'm just the man for the job, the job being some kind of bereavement counselor/interviewer for the Hospice of Lancaster. To be honest, I'd been trying not to give school or psychology a second thought for the next five weeks or so, but something about this offer lit a bulb in my cobwebbed mind. Maybe it will give me another chance to further explore my own coping, maybe it could work out to be my internship for the spring.....who knows.  It was fun to play a little old school D on Sunday again. We'd been giving Star Wars a whirl for a little while, but something was just itching inside me to write a new campaign for my old heroes, some of whom have moved on, and others who are still fighting the good fight. It's always especially fun for me to introduce new players to the game too, and I think we had an excellent introductory game. So you see, I   have   been writing, just not in here. (sticking out my tongue)  Robb, Miranda and I decided to pop "The Warden" into the DVD player last night, (a) because Robb had never really seen the full film before, and (b) because you can't have dinner in my living room without watching something on the tube. Each time I watch the movie, I become more critical of it. I don't think that's a bad thing, to be honest, because I think to a certain extent that one should always look back upon their work and not simply enjoy it, but also think of ways to improve upon it. I was picking apart my performance, often down to my facial expressions and body language. And while I wish I had done some things differently, now I just want to act again, and again and again and again!  Robb challenged me to make my own film, and while the thought has crossed my mind, it's not something I'm ready to do yet. I'm just glad I have befriended so many people with similar interests and talents, and I hope we all pool them again in a new effort.....well that, and I think it's neat wearing a cape. (raising an eyebrow)  So I'm really just rambling at this point. How is everyone else doing? Getting along well? Love? War? Humor? Tragedy? All in order, yes? Good good. I think it's time I went and took a long shower, and then it's off to the store once more. Tune in next time, which I promise will be before another week passes, and we'll have some more fun.....      (POOF!)
