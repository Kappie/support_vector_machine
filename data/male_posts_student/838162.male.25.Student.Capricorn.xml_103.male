Of course this is the very same Gmail service thats been making the rounds in the Tech news because of the 1Gig worth of email space as well as the controversial google supported ads appearing along the side bar that are based on your emails. In other words, the system would scan ones email that is stored in the servicel and then show advertisments that match keywords found in the emails, thereby creating personalized advertisments which some people feel is an invasion of privacy.  I'm all up to testing it for a couple of months in this close beta testing period. I have already listed it here on this blog as the email address to contact me with and I have forwarded my secondary email accounts to it. However, I'm reluctant to forward my main mail account to Gmail, for the simple fact that most of my mail is spam anyway due to using it to subscribe to too many mailing list and newsletters over the past 7 years. Really should have gotten a secondary account for all that back then.  Quite pleased that I managed to get an account, I remember being one of the first testers for Google back when they we still in beta. Always had a soft spot for Google since then. It does help that they are now the search engine of choice.  All in all...this should be quite interesting to see how things turn out. The only problem I forsee is that I somehow forgot to change the default Gmail email address given and now I can't change it.
