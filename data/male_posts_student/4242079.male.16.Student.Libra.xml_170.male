Tell everyone you know. Hopefully within the month I will have a domain up, with hosting on a paid server with better up time. That will be swell.  This is probably the most disgusting hamburger I have ever eaten. When I chew it, things are grinding in my teeth, almost like it is coated with sand. Tastes splendid, but the texture is a little much.   I had today off, and I really did enjoy myself. Lots of TV, eating junk food, and working on my computer. Did you know that the dollar store is the only place in Sylvan Lake that sells CAT 5 network cable? Shocking, isn't it?  Well. I shall be letting you go now.
