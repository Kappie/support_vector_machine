It hasn't resolved anything. It hasn't made anyone feel any better. It hasn't done anything for anyone else.  So why do I keep writing about political, or at least politically charged topics?  Because I have to say  something . It's like a boiling pot. I see story after story talking about things that just get to me, they push my buttons and make me crazy. I have to do something. I don't want to discuss it with someone face to face, I hate that more than anything. I truly hate getting in arguments. Reasonable discussions I can handle, but I just don't like how I feel when I get in an argument. I don't like seeing how the other person/people feel either. So what can I do? I can post it somewhere where maybe a few people will see it, but nobody will particularly care.  Why is it that politics has to be so damned inflamatory? I need to think about this some more. I've tried to write 5 different paragraphs right here to express what I'm trying to communicate, and I haven't been able to come close yet.  One more time...  I guess what bugs me more than anything is closed minded people. Some may call me closed minded, and I could easily understand why. I'm very firm in quite a number of my beliefs and opinions. But if an opposing viewpoint is presented I will always listen (provided it is communicated in a non-confrontational manner) and try very hard to judge it on its merits. I may quickly discard it as being in direct opposition to my core values or beliefs, but even in rejection I will try to at least understand why someone feels or thinks the way they do. If I can't understand then it kind of makes me evne more disappointed - I have failed to learn and understand.  I can understand on a psychological level why some people don't want to understand - but it really,  really  bugs me when they don't even want to try.  I had a religious argument with a friend once - a man I honestly admired. The discussion began with him telling me that I was completely wrong in my beliefs. After about an hour of discussion I began to see that we were talking about the same things, but we were using different words - it was purely semantics. I had him define very carefully particular terms he was using, and then I would carefully define the terms I was using - using nearly the same language. He would then promptly declare that we weren't talking about the same thing. The best I can guess is that in his mind I was already wrong, it was simply inconceivable to him that I could believe the same things he believed in. I wasn't asking him to believe the things I believed in, I wasn't trying to convert him, I was trying to find common ground to stand on, and he wasn't even willing to consider that common ground might exist.  That's what bugs me about political discussions. A complete unwillingness to find common ground. A ready willingness to assume the worst motives, to find the worst in someone.   I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
