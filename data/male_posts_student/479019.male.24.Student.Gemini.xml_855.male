I actually think the sounds of it goes hand in hand with that of Police Rape classics such as "Silver Dollar Pancakes" and doo wop song.   Now playing: Ozma - "Game Over"  So who are the rest of you?   So I have a bunch of reading to do and I've got to photcopy stuff and I'm going to a talk today.  I'm gonna burn a new CD for my listening pleasure. Should I stick with one band, or mix things up?  Now playing: Alkaline Trio - "Another Innocent Girl"  I've been losing weight recently... due to laziness, lack of fatty red meat, and other factors... I need to stuff myself.  **
