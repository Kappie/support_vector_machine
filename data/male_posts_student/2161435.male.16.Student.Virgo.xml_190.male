That means keeping my revision notes by my side at all times but kind of forgetting they're there. Oh well. Tomorrow I'm going to my mates birthday BBQ/Partay. The problem is it's a birthday and I don't know what to get him. Plus...it's TOMORROW! any ideas? I'd be very, very grateful! poor you Dave...get well soon! (that'll teach you for drinking so much!)
