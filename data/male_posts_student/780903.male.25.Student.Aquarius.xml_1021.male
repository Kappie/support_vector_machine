"Depreciation" to the tune of "Locomotion"   Everybody's paying a lot less tax now Come on filer, do depreciation We're all reducing basis at a speed too fast now Come on filer, do depreciation Some more acceleration so we're getting a break  Less income for the IRS to come in and take So come on, come on, do depreciation with me.  We used to match that cost but, Come on filer, the rules, have changed. Allowed deductions rearranged  Straight line depreciation was the rule for years now, Come on filer, do depreciation But A.C.R.S. numbers give you more to save now, Come on filer, do depreciation We'll shorten all the schedules and increase the rate Erase the salvage value and it all will be great So come on, come on, do depreciation with me.
