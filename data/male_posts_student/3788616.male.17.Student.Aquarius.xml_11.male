Everybody who knew me just simply knew that i wasn't being me and that i was super stiff and restrained! Argh! damn it... however, at least, it worked quite well and we drew a significant number of attention! haha... yup... anyway, another problem! Argh! Chris forgot to help me buy the glitter and glitter pens that i required! Argh! now... i just have to make do with whatever resources i have!  Worst of all, i am sick! yes! Sick! horribly weakened and fatigue right now... damn it... i really want to be well! Please bless me! ARGH!!! anyway, i need to go and do the card and make it as best as i can now! So... HELP!!! chao! Take care! For now, let's just place our trust in HIM! As the sharing goes lah! ;p  But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.   Jeremiah 17:7-8
