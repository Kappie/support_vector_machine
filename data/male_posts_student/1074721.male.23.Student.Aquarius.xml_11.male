( done it :) ). Well the journey was a story in itself.  A fairly long story actually. I had my train reservation frm my home town Jhansi. I missed the train by just 5 min on Saturday morning. What followed was nothing less than a Bollywood blockbuster ( ok ..... a lot less than that ... but still a lot :) ) A had to catch a bus to Kanpur, ... spent 5 hours in the heat and humidity of Bundelkhand as the rickety bus travelled to Kanpur. The other ticket that i had got after missing my train was not confirmed, i had been waitlisted at number 13. Well ... i found out that my status then was number 8, but had no chances of getting confirmed. Now i had to urgently reach Calcutta to deposit the fees, so ... i bribed a coolie on the station ..( well it seems to me that the job of coolies at Kanpur station is not to carry the luggage of passengers ... but rather to "help" poor fellows like me in getting a berth in the train they want ( of course after charging a hefty fees:) ) ) I had to pay the fellow 100 bucks .... then the ticket collector another 500 bucks over the fare diffrence between 2 AC and 3 AC ........ 1100 bucks down the drain :( just for the delay of 5 min ... can u imagine.   Anyway the rest of the journey was fine ..... did not have to experience the heat .... I tried to take a look out of the window during the travel ... but was really shocked by the state of affairs in Bihar ... villages on the track side seemed to be straight out of some old age movie with thacthed roofs and all .. .did not think that there was as backward a place as Bihar.   Anyway .. more of it in the next post ... am off to try and find myself some thing to eat :)    Mihir
