I guess I've start pining for someone who probably I have not met, and don't even know her name, I don't even know her. But yea, love can sometimes be very distant, and when someone comes along with some telescope, yea, maybe you do get carried away.   But really, sometimes to find true love, we gotta wait. We gotta realize that love is, kinda omniscient sometimes. It knows when you need it and really, you gotta be open when it hits. So if you're 50, disgruntled, single and very cynical, thinking that love is shit. Well....your fault. Really, I'm not one to buy the get hitched at 20+ kinda shit. And really, I believe that love happens at any age. But you gotta know who's the telescope and who's the star who's the one for you.  I believe in "the one" and yea, I believe she would appear one day, maybe I've yet to meet her, or she may be freezing her ass of in Siberia, or maybe heck, she may be someone right in front of me all this while. Sometimes, its the mystery of love which astounds us. And really, I gotta get that bit of mystery back into my life. I guess you won't ever know how liberating it is to forget a love which has caused you that much pain.  Its time when I need to put that smile back on my face. And no, I'm not giving up on chinese pop lol. Its really something I admire for its songwriting and really, we all need to believe in the power of love sometimes. Its my belief, which actually meant to explain and justify new systems or schools of thought, meant to be used in some political/sociological discussion, with hints of darwinism.   "There is no such things as good or bad circumstances, it is only how we react to it which makes it good or bad."  I realized its very much universal. Yea, whatever happens is never good or bad, it is bad because I react to it negatively. But a love lost is a life gained. I realized that I have the choice to make this circumstance and this situation positive, and to live life even more. Love has enriched my love no doubt, and it will continue to enrich my life, but yea the source of love differs. And now, my source of love is someone who I may have not met, have not talked to, have not known the name of. Or maybe its someone I have known all this while, or maybe not.   This is the mystery of love.........which sometimes thats what makes life beautiful.......
