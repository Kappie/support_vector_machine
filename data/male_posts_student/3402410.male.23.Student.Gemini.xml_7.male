I'm at the end of things and before the beginning of things -- the semester expires in four days, I'm off to Newfoundland on Friday, and school starts again in September. I'm in a state of mild panic.  The usuals suspects are holding court in the top of my skull.   Namely,  What am I doing in school?  and,  What am I doing with my life?  When I wasn't in school I was anxious about wasting my time, wasting my life. Now that I'm in school I feel the same way.  I hate emotions. I don't know what to  do  with them. I should be proud of what I've done in the last year. I've always been a horrible student, and this past year -- while not exceptional -- is certainly unprecedented in my academic career. I suppose I am proud of myself. A B+ average for a guy who got expelled for failing seven of his seven classes his second semester at college. When the going got tough, I used to get drunk. Now I stay up all night and actually finish my work. And  then  get drunk.  But it's not like I've discovered a new me. I'm the same. I'm just as restless as I ever was. I have fantasies of disappearing in the middle of the night, leaving without a note. Maybe join the army, maybe join a monastery. Maybe hitchhike down to Columbia, maybe walk to Winnipeg. Maybe something else.  This is going to sound terribly pretentious, but I think what I need is a life's work .  A  passion .   I am consciously avoiding investing my pent up passion in people. That hurts too fucking much. I want my relationships with people to be less intense, less all-consuming. I'll take my five blocks of personal space thank-you very much. What does that leave though? A thing, an object of interest. A hobby? I have hobbies though. No, something bigger than a hobby. A life's work. But what?  So people, what's your life's work? What's your passion? I want to know. If you don't have a passion, is it a problem? Or are you just too busy with life to notice?
