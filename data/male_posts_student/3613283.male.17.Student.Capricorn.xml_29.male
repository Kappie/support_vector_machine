This morning, I was doing a final in World History and Geography. The topic I chose was "The struggle of Algeria". It was about French colonization. At this point, you might be wondering: why in hell is he talking about Baghdad and Algeria?  As I was writing a paragraph of the essay some three hours into the exam, I wrote something to that extent:   "Numerous fightings are taking place on Algeria's territory. In the newspapers, one can notice the broad diffusion of violence: lots of innocent victims die during the attacks perpetrated by rebel forces. France's military presence is significant though; indeed, one fifth of all French soldiers are stationed in Algeria"   (this from my draft)   Does it sound familiar?    urlLink Read the story out of Baghdad on FOX's website.
