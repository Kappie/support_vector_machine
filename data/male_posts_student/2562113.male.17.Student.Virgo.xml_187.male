I felt an impending shit coming on so I ran back to the dorm and unleashed hell on the toilet. One minute later Bob is furiously banging on the bathroom door so I had to pack up camp prematurely. Erek experienced the same problem. Food poisoning without a doubt. As I'm typing this, Bob just ran into the bathroom again. MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS!!!  -BIGsmut!
