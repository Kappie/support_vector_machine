Then I went sailing with Steve and Jerouen (my uncle from the Netherlands).  My dad tried to hop on the catamaran and couldn't get in, haha.  But I lost my blue wetshoe.  I got some new ones.  Took a 4 mile walk and did some laps in the pool.  Been playing Final Fantasy quite heavily.  Not much else.  Miss ya Ashee.
