My Graduation was 2 days ago and I'm still kinda weirded out by the fact I won't be going back to high school, but all my other cousin's and sibling's (other than Jun) graduated so long ago that it's probably a faded memory for them. Jeez I'm so young. I'm very tired. I have finals too, which will eat the crap out of my first 3 weeks of summer. Plus I need a job (badly). I can't be a scrub leeching of the hunnies any more. Anyway, I'm most likely boring you, so I'll stop.  Wait, w00t Detroit Pistons! Haha. Detroit what? I know everyone else is hating me now.  Oh, here's a picture of me for you:        If you want a full-sized version I can send it to you (I don't see why you would want it though...)
