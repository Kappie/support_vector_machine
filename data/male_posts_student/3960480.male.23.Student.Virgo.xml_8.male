I went to his last birthday concert in London, last  February, and back then he already was too ill to  attend himself. I'll remember that as a very special  occasion.   Goldsmith's film music was intelligent, experimental  and above all genuine. Like all good film-music it  crept under your skin. He was capable of writing  themes that stuck in your head and music that defined moods. What distinguished him from so many others  was the way he influenced not just his colleagues, but  entire genres.   We called him a living legend, and now he'll be  remembered as one of the great composers of our  century.   Read the article on  urlLink StarTrek.com for a more detailed account.
