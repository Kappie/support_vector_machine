I had a huge math project to do that ended up looking like Barney... I colored it purple and green. I stayed up 'til midnight then woke up to do homework at 5:30, that I had not done in place of the project the night before.  My brother read the journal when I was in bed the other night... He probably still does and is most likely going to read this entry. *waves*   Grr, youth group tonight. It seems like the people there are friendly, just not friendly... As in they're nice in their "cliques" and then aren't exactly nice, or willing, to get friends outside of their groupies...  If I ever told my youth group leader, who knows me, but doesn't really... Well... She doesn't show personal feelings. Only to people that've been around a long time. She's nice though, and I'm thankful to know someone like that.  I've played  urlLink Neoquest II  some more today, and got past that stupid boss. The final boss was easier then him, though. I'm in a new world, and so far it's pretty easy, but it's the last world, and I need to level up 10 levels to get to the max level. It's highly reccomended for the last boss, who is extremely hard. Or atleast that's why people say on the forums... I don't believe it, because they said that the cursed faeries were hard, and they were fairly easy. I beat them at a really low level. I think below forty.  I'm zoning out into that subconcious level that I mentioned in one of the previous journal entries. I feel like I'm high... *sniff. Starts coughing like he's having a hangover* j/k j/k *The genie disappears... for now...*
