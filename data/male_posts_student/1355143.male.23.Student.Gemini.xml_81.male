The national football team I mean, and guess who went to see them play Catalunya????????  Me!!!!!!! And it was wicked, 5-2 to Brazil, the atmosphere was crazy, brazilians playing drums, the fans actually making some noise!  I swear that there was more chanting etc... at this one game than in all the others I have been to see put together!  Mexican waves, you name it we had it!  Ronaldo scored two cracking goals before going off at half time and we even had an overhead kick to top it all off, special!  Went to the Catwalk on Saturday night and got smacked off my face.......again!  Ended up in passeig de gracia metro, walking between the yellow and green lines (that long, interminable walk!) pretending to be in the matrix, sound effects and everything!  Must have been quite amusing!  Last night was time to say goodbye to one of the girls who came in January, sayin goodbye to people for the third time in a year became a surreal experience, doesnt get any easier!  Edgar has gone on holiday and left me all alone for a week, all about having a pre-party really!  Forsnizzel ;op  Anywho, must go and find something to do, so peace out, one love,  A
