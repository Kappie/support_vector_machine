So, if any of you have ideas, I'd like to first foremention that you may e-mail me, but to prevent any spamming, I won't post my address here. You can access my site, actually my photography website, via the side link tool bar titled "Negative Space". Woah, we've got a lot of spaces now don't we ;) Just head to the contact section on that site and give me a ring, Thanks a ton!  Now, going into what I was going to talk about,   Cory wanted me to inform you all about the secondary side world of Empty Space. You see, a majority of ourselves have somewhat crazed and sadistically manic side ego's, so, since practically every person in the comic has one, we have dedicated an entire world where these cool guys can hang out, drink coffee, and do whatever crazy ego's do in their spare time.  I really don't want to give away the side ego's too much because it sort of ruins the impact factor it'll have on all of you once you see em'. So, for the moment being, just keep in mind that they all probably could be legally deemed medically insane ;)  Onto the whole Steve thing. Steve was an incredibly hilarious idea, and from the last two comments to my last post, We've decided to have it where Steve truly does exist, but Cameron has to prove his existence to us. Some of the comments have all ready given me some ideas. I have decided that for copyright reasons, I will only let out episode scripts on the site, if the demand is truly there let alone, after the comics have been forged with the scripts.   In any case, there's not much else I can say. I would like to encourage that any of the team members have an idea to openly post it, but make sure not to give it all at first. I'm sure Cory won't agree with me, but I have my own certain paranoia issues with copyright and all that. Don't specifically aim your ideas of being episodes, but just relate a story you've had or would feel would be prime material, and we'll see if it'll work.  I better be heading off, I just wrote this after coming home from work and now my wrists are going to kill me.  Take Care!
