If you read what is going on, the White House is declaring that we are entering a new phase of Iraqi reconstruction, and the oversight of these duties is being moved out of the Pentagon and CIA, and into a civilian authority within the White House.    Does that really seem unseemly?  Or does it make sense to have the Pentagon and CIA in charge of building roads, bridges and schools?
