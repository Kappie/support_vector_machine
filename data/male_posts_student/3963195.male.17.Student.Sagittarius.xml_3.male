I passed out from 10th standard from infant Jesus Anglo Indian higher secondary school with 67.5% and I joined there itself for my +2 and I graduated from there with 73.25% in my ISC Examination……… Initially I decided to join in Christ College, Banglore but then due to my low mark I was refused admission but then it would have been possible for me to get into that college if I entered into a twinning program…but that too due to lack of my luck or because of some other matters I decided not to join there………….Thinking that I could easily get into some colleges in my home town itself I completely threw away “my study home away plan” but here too I was struck with bad luck. I submitted my applications to two of the main colleges in Kollam Fathima National college and Sree Narayana college………. I was not at all in the merit list of Fathima college (might be because we did not have Business studies as some of my friends said or because of my bad luck) but I made it in the list of the SN college I was ranked the 127th…oh god after all of that high standard English with Good accent, Un comparable standard in accounts when compared with state syllabus and the learning of Management theories in commerce which are taught in undergraduate level or even in the post graduate level and excellent know how in economic working of the country …………all what I get is 127th rank……….
