In what shape or form that I might be, just another chance for me.      A hurried time - no disgrace. Instead of racing to conclusion   and wishing all my life away. No one can stop me now.      Time is up - it couldn't last, but there's more things I'd like to do.   I'm coming back to try again. Someday, maybe I'll wait 'til then.       Iron Maiden - No More Lies    God I love them lyrics. They seem really relevant, too.
