Yesterday I contacted his personal aide who hold his handphone and told him that there's urgent matter regarding the website. Poor boss, he's actually not been very well and had been given 1 month MC.Hmm, even heading his own company he still ask for MC from he doctor. His personal aide, Mr. Z also said they are hiring a full time staff to update  maintain the website and the staff will report duty next week. I have to complete the documentation then. His last known location is in Singapore (had  urlLink any   urlLink of   urlLink you  seen him?) and he'll be back home next Monday. Looks like next week I'll be back into full-swing operation. Now, where's my graphic designer?
