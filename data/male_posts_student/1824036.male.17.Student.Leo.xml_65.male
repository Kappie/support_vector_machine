It was an all out bull-rush victory. Adam Moritz came back after a pretty nasty  urlLink hip pointer . Preston Peterson was a little hurt so he couldn't kick. Up steps...  ....  .... ME!!!! I got to kick JV. I kicked off 4 times, the first being a pretty good kick, the second being down-right sucky. The third being decent, and the fourth being a really great boot! Nothing too much else to say.
