Anyway I bullied nehneh a few days ago, by posting a v v bad message on his tagboard. Something to do with him being v holier-than-thou, I believe. Something abt him juz rubs me the wrong way. I blew up at him that morning when he told me I was being "extra", though he probably doesn't noe. I was simmering for a v long while in class, even though I noe it was a v stupid thing to be angry over. Nevertheless, tt still does not stop me from being quite irritated at his attitude. Needless to say, alot of pple blasted me on nananael's blog, and im even more irritated over tt. That cousin Jun of his especially. I noe its wrong but tt's juz how I feel!! I also seem to be losing my temper much more often now, and always quite dramatically. I blew up at my brother last nite and had quite a fight with him, but pple with his and nehneh's attitude are sooo irritating! Gabriel is b!tching abt his sister again, on his blog. Relax, im not one to use vulagarities often, just quoting from Gab himself. I'd much rather trade my brother for his sis! I fail to see how sisters can be worse than brothers. Just to get the record straight, here are several traits I hate ina person: Self righteousness. This is the worst, and in nat's blog entries, he often seems to be like this. Don't believe me? Go look at his blog yourself. Ah, im at it again. I shall pray for guidance, heck, why not now? Ok, finished. Then again, i dislike hypocrites, but I also fall into this category. Surprised? Don't be. I am a reprehensible human being, and rely on God to guide me(I hope). Had to do a Christian survey today, I felt so guilty because I didn't noe wad to put down. You see, im not a v devoted Christian, not like Oliver. I have my doubts, and wad i belive in is not entirely canon. I am a very insecure person indeed. Anyway, Now I've abt completed this self slamming entry, I shall go do something else. Wouldn't u like to noe what? Heheh.
