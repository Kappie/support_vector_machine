Well, here are the primuses of your regular Saturday morning cartoons: ABC Family: Spiderman: Watch a man deal with super-human spider powers and screw around. Power Rangers Dino-Thunder: Watch American race-confused super heroes pretend to punch Japenese archive. Beyblade: Watch another fad show about nothing. Cartoon Network: Dexter's Lab: Watch a Irish midget genious deal with everyday-life. Grim Adventures of Billy  Mandy: Watch a pervert and a psychopath deal with life with the grim reaper. Powerpuff Girls: Watch 5 year-old whores beat the snot out of a raging alcoholic. Johnny Bravo: Watch a horny Elvis-lookalike hit on girls. Nickelodeon: Spongebob: Watch a brain-damaged sponge living underwater. Fairly Odd Parents: Watch a ten year-old with god parents screw everything up.  If you watch Saturday morning cartoons and you have read this, I'd be gladly for you to reconsider the morning activity.
