Its a mental survival trait, in my opinon. If this ability was removed, the entire human race would begin to slowly turn into manic depressives. Its affects would not be apparent immeadiatly, but as more and more people realised that the driving force behind thier life, the one thing that made their worth living was in fact a great big pile of huge fucking dog shite, human soceity would begin to turn in on itself. If everyone had reasonable, sensible goals, then life couldn't work on a day to day basis.
