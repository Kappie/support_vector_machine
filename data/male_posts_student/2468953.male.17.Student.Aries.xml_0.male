He love to laugh, really...  Boys and girls, we all attend on 8 something. We get ready for his present and food, and parties!!! Some of our friend drove his mother's Kompressor to take us around. It's really cool! It's my first time to seat on an "open roof" Benz. We go around to Dato Kramat, to be seen by other :| After that we back to the party again. and bla bla bla...  On about 1 am in the morning, just playing card and talking about all crap. So come the police - he said that we are too loud and the neighbour are complainning us. Nothing to do, our IC are checked by the police, and he tell us to go back. What a party... We are all shocked because some of us are the first time for this situation. We must follow his instruction or we are in lock-up. I think it excite, and maybe this is a BIG present for KhoBo.
