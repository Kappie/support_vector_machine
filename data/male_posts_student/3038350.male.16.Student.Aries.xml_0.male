I want to be your guiding light, The one to show you the way. I want to be your reason for happiness, The one to brighten your mood at will. I want to be your personal candy store, The one to satisfy your sweet tooth. I want to be your playground, The one to postpone your duties, your escape from cruel reality. I want to be your dream, The one to wish you a good day before you awaken in the morning. I want to be your everlasting love, The one to care for and nurture you. I want to be your everything, The one to supply your every need, The one to give you strength, The one to comfort you... forever.

I wrote this one last night for him  Happiness I am so happy that I found you You really pick me up  especially when I am blue If I woke up tomorrow  and found you beside me I would give you a kiss  and call you my hunny When I get hurt you take the pain even when you dont know how  the loss of you would be a shame Our love is like a flower  it gets better as it grows Will it ever end? I do not know I hope it will not stop  for then my heart would break  That would me the biggest mistake But lets not think like that for what we have is unthinkable when I am with you my happiness is uncontrollable  Donna Lee Heathcote  Copyright ©2004 Donna Lee Heathcote   And then I wrote some crazy ones wanna see them? lol  Craziness I am on crack oh yes I am people look at me weird like I am ole Uncle Sam  I dont know where this is coming from or where this might be going all I know is I am really messed up but I am having a BLAST!
