Though there was this drunk Scottish guy who was hitting on my mother all night, which got me very upset. Her too. Enough about that though.  Seattle. That's where I am for those of you paying attention. It's a nice place I guess. It's better when you're visiting, but even then this fog of gloominess haunts you.  But it's Mercer Island where all my memories lie. Mercer Island. A horrible terrible awful bad no good place. For starters, it's a totally dead place. I mean it. I've tried to stop complaining about people who whine about Palo Alto's night life, but going back to Mercer Island made me vow to never hold back ever again. The town is dead. Driving through the only thing close to to a "downtown" on the island, I saw no one. No one. We went to Baskin Robbins for ice cream, and no one was there. It was a ghost town. No. Ghost towns emit memories of life that once was.  The people are stale. I'm not saying there are no good people, but to say that there are many would be a lie. It's a bubble. I mean, it  is  an island. And it shows. Life...is hard there. Individuality is impossible to have, or you are not wanted. I was not wanted. The people in this city drove me to two suicide attempts ultimately leading me to dropping out of 7th grade.  But that's not to say I have no good memories here. My friend Tim and I met up, and after dark, we went to the island. We went to our elementary school, which I found I had missed. Every play structure had a story to remember. Being there at dark was something we had never done before, and it felt like an appropriate epilogue to my story there.  My old house is right across from the one Middle School on the island, so of course we visited those too, though not to the extremes we had taken with our Elementary School.  We were to meet up with an old friend, one I was never too close with, but would have loved to see, so we went to the northern part of the island and waited by the QFC for our expected arrival. After a while some drunk high-schoolers drove up, kids I once knew, in a very different time. These were kids I never expected to see in the state they were in. We had a conversation. I enjoyed it. They had no clue who I was, and they also didn't know where California was, at least not in their condition. Our friend never showed up, so we left quickly as the inebriated boys tried to jump in the back of Tim's truck for a ride to Seattle, which wasn't even where we were headed of course.  I had friends I didn't get to see that I would very much have liked to, though how much I'd admit that to myself I don't know. I browsed through Tim's yearbooks, trying to get a feel of what happened to everyone I once knew. All that I learned was that I never knew anybody, and I am very much filled with a feeling of regret. I know they were shallow self-centered people, but they were self-centered people I would very much have liked to be friends with, not the weird annoying kid who mysteriously dissapeared in 7th grade and never come back.   Some of those friends had gone to places I never expected. A good friend of mine had gone on to become very involved in school politics, win Homecoming King, and be the star of the Wrestling Team. These aren't the type of people I would normally associate with, but I very much wished I could see him.  More people disappeared, leaving a feeling that I had left a world full of change and excitement, a world I didn't belong in anymore, or maybe never belonged in at all. Some people talk about how much they would like to be able to go back in time and change what they've done. I don't think there is anything more I could want in the world. Aside from correcting all the mistakes that linger with me daily, and probably will haunt me for the rest of my life, I'd try new things. I'd try to socialize with people I wouldn't think of socializing with. There are entire webs and worlds that I will never be involved in. As corny as it sounds, I think what haunts me the most is that there will be so many people I will never be friends with, never share small talk, never exchange smiles in the hall.  I wouldn't want to live forever. I would want to be trapped in time. In a world where things didn't change. It would take an eternity to meet every person and see everywhere, but when you were done you could return to the things you remember and have your memories still hold true. Have people be the same, have nothing be destroyed or created. A world in perfect stasis, awaiting someone to explore it and master its secrets.  I miss the friends I never had.
