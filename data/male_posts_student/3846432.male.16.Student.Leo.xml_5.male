The main reason for this BLOG is because I dont have time to keep a journal mainly too lazy and journals aren't what I spend my time doing, as in I spend alot of time on the computer and enjoy it so it makes sense that here is where I would keep a journal.      I enjoy order but I love chaos ( especially when its my doing!!! ). Those who know me wouldn't mention that and maybe they dont pay attention to that detail but its a vital part of me. I love many things in life and respect alot of other aspects of it; such as my G/F she means the world to me but her parents are very strict- I respect that they dont want her and I to be together or around each other or having fun with each other but I do contradict that through being around her and trying to be some type of B/F to her. Overall I think I am a very nice out going guy, I do have bad aspects ,like everyone, although for the most part I try to be a person others would like to       themselves after in my character. I look at myself to be very chivilarous and also extremely involved with my studies outside of school and also my friends lives. Now anyone who knows me should know that few people get to be my Friends and i make it this way because of trust, you see it is very important to me that I have a circle of people that can be trusted rather than just have fun with but thats not to say I dont have aquintances I dont enjoy being around for the most part though I try to limit the amount of people who really know me for who I am.
