Then Evan, Jordan and I watched Reqium for a Dream till like 3, still one of the best movies of all time.  Yea, last night was good.  Today I'm cleaning my room...It's a rancid mess, and I really don't like it being messy, so I'm just gonna do that and sleep, since I got no sleep yesterday, which is alright, as long as people wanna do something later today. Oh yeah, isn't today like the shortest day or sumthin.....  This IS the most wonderful time of the year!!
