PS Look at my personal profile, cos it took so long to get the wordcount down, sorted out, seperated by commas to be accepted as like "favourite music" etc, you know how it is, that I totally burst a vessel in stress. So look at it.  PPS I've just realised my blog name, Nice Guys Finish Last, is double entrende! (that is a double meaning, of which the play on words or second meaning has sexual connotations, for those of you are tragically uniformed). whay. And lets face it, Sam has such amazing stamina he certainly finishes last, ;) actually a more obvious double entrende would just be Nice Guys Last Longest. Or Smiles Lasts Longest. meh. I digress...  So basically I thought I should put in a bit of background of this week, the biggest event of which was a family *argh irritating relatives* homecoming for my sister's return from Malaysia where she went to teach in a primary school from last August straight through till now. And from next week, if I don't stop off in Malaysia on my travels or whatever, we won't see her for a whole 2 years! Which is a bit weird.       So ANYWAY. She got back last week, and my Mum went spacco with worry that me and Tom (my twin) would take the piss, cos we always,  always  take the piss outta Em. Don't ask me why, she's lovely and the typical tolerant older sister. She even brought us back presents from Asia and Sri Lanka! And still we took the piss, primarily cos of how excited she got telling us anecdotes, and also cos we hoepd she'd have a Malay twang we could imitate. Alas, she does not : (. Anyways she reckons I've grown loads, :D so obvi I couldn't be nasty after her complimenting my height. Also, despite me and Toms' harsh banter to her, we actually really missed her. Argh! 2 posts in and already this blogging lark is leading me astray into communicating emotions, which I said I wouldn't do (at least in a way that gives away *anything* about me).    and she's bein a right ole jetsetter, which she never used to be. Where we might go to Cornwall for a weekend, she jets off on a dirt cheap little plane to a Thai island! It's very surreal, and cool, but I can never be happy for other people, dammit! I'm SO bloomin selfish :(  My gran, grandad, 4 cousins, older brother, and other older sister were also there. Joe (older brother) got thrills over his new car, a lushy-osa black fiat punto, a might chavvy. But still! And he just started his job as a fully qualified *doctor*. Soo, soooooooo worrying. "I hate sick or ill people" - his own admission! And party was fun, etc. Apart from my gran, not the most subtle of ppeople, calls me over and goes "Samuel, darling, your mother tells me you're studying  Paradise Lost  next year at school?" I said yeah, preparing to blag intelligence to her cos she is so.. exacting  about stuff like this. She just looks at me, and says "Well, I fear it will be completely lost on you". Yay! Thanks, gran!  Today me, my mum and my sister went to good ole Saino's to re-introduce Em to western foods. She got massively chuffed over sandwiches, which I found disproportionately hilarious. What was also funny is my mum getting all enthusiastic about cooking some fusion food, like Thai chicken or indonesian noodles, y'know the stuff, and my sister was just like "nooooooo, don't get me wrong, I love rice - but from next week onwards I'll be eating a rice or noodle meal Every. Single. Day, so whilst we're here can't we have western food? like... sandwiches ? "*sam cracks up nastily again*. In Kuala Lumper, its like 35 degrees all the time or sommat, so she spends the whole time here complaining about how cold, etc it is here. And poeple who know me, realsie just how much cold/rubbish weather in summer annoys me! So I got quite stressy about that... :S BAD SAM. lol.     Ooh and I went to the new "simply food" M store and dave WAS NOT THERE! I was so sure he would be, so was gutted cos I haven't caught up with him for ages. And if you're reading, Dave, I'll have you know that I looked all over MS in town on both wed AND thurs and couldn't find you there, wither. *smug face at having won a 1 sided argument*.
