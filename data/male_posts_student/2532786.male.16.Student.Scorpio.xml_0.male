Though this one is actually turning out to be a pretty good site.  I finally got my game finished and once I have finished this site I'll be working on my next game. Hopefully Coldstone will be updated soon so i can get rid of the last few bugs in my game.  On the music side of things, I have managed to get my iPod working again though it does still go weird sometimes. My music collection has grown to a healthy 375 songs and is still growing. The soon the iTMS comes to the UK the better :)  Hope you are bored now. Good. Now sod off and let me get back to work :D
