It's kind of a tradition with my Case friends...it's always a great time... bbq and we buy a shit load of fireworks(real fireworks, not wimpy stuff) and set them off over the lake.  Festivities will start around 5 or 6ish, but just come anytime, i'll start grilling around 6.  If you just wanna come for fireworks, come at like 9 or 9:30.  I hope everyone can make it!  Ravi
