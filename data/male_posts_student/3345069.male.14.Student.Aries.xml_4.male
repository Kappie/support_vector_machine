As of now they have won their last four games after sweeping the Padres over the weekend. Hopefully this will continue for the rest of the season, which seems to be going by pretty fast with 35 of 162 games played. Hopefully Mark Prior and Gonzo can get back soon, to really make the Cubs unstopable. I think that's all for now, but you can visit  urlLink www.cubs.com  if you are interested in the Cubs.
