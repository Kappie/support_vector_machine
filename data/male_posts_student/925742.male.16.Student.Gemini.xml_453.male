Thats great for him, I'm happy, Greg's always been there for me.  But  its just times like this where I question how the fuck some people get emotional security and I get none.  Well.... I guess relationships aren't security.  Hehh............. whats the point of a high school relationship?  I fell off the bus today at school and all the junior high kids started laughing.  I want to hurt them.  Whats the point, though?  It will turn around on me with consequences.  What a fucking world that people don't get theirs and I get bullshit.  I don't know whats worse.... being helpless against their jibes, or being completely capable of murdering them all and yet being bound by Man's laws, rendered helpless.  I'm the latter.  Goddamnit, whats the point.  The coat I had oil on from the Units on Saturday, and gave to the drycleaners that day.... that coat jacket I bought with Kim Son and Kim Anh after Thanksgiving, the wonderful night and day I spent with her (ahem I'm getting off topic, like a retard) the $130 columbia jacket.  They didn't bother to clean it.  For 5 days, they didn't do crap with it.  The inner jacket is ruined, since the oil stains had time to set.  God, their incompetance makes me so angry.  SO now I have to wash it by hand, and the whole premise makes me angry.  Gary's gonna get them to reimburce me a new jacket or 130 big ones.... but in the end... whats the point?  I also feel like I'm the last to get laid ever.  Whats the point?  Do I need to fuck to achieve Nirvana?  Goddamn, whats the point.  Whats the point of doing drugs if I'll just feel this way again?  So many reasons NOT to smoke, so many reasons TO smoke.  Damn........ whats the point?  Life's too goddamn short to waste talking like this.  If I was less...... I don't know... scared?  I would do what I actually wanted.  I want to maim, fuck, smoke, and have a good fucking night's rest, and be satisfied for once.  Really, I think that would satisfy me, and make me content.    The non-illegal option, however, is find another relationship, another girl, another someone (well I found her, but by cracky I must take the initiative and do something) who will make my brain release those 'high on life' endorphins that I had two months ago, just by thinking about her.  Boy that is 'love' thing is funny, I wonder what it is.....  But then of course, there's the possibility of being broken again.  That's not pleasant at all.  You know, 7 months ago, I never cried.  Now its like, I focus on an event and it ends up with tears, I must be a giant fucking pussy or something.  And these are happy memories!  I must be sad because they ain't gonna happen again.  Gaaah.   Yeah, I think what I need, rather than another relationship, is to find some form of inner peace.  Thats a pretty decent idea, I would say.  Where to start.... fuck.  I don't know.  I guess I need to figure out the point.  What is the point?  Life is pain, get over it?  Life is an adventure?  Life is a big joke?  Life goes by too fast... don't dwell?  Well, I best get cracking on that.  I bid you farewell....and this.      Your  Ultimate Purity Score  Is...
