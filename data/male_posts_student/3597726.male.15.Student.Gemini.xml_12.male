Her birthday is actually on sunday, but she really wanted this book and she was thinking about buying it the next time she rode to wal-mart...so I gave it to her early. I think she liked it. From what I've heard, she read it for soooo clong last night. Her mom said taht she loved the card. She was going on and on about it. Thats good, because I was up till 2 am making the card for her. yeah, i'm pretty happy about that. I'll be seeing her pretty soon. She's so cool. She just rocks.   So, anyway, EARLY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, KATIE! ROCK ON!
