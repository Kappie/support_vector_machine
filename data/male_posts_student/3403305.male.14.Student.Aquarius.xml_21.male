You may ask this, but really it’s common sense, they’re all blocked by a misleading monolith  (Chorus: Faith No More’s Epic) You want it all, but you can’t have it It’s in your face but you can’t grab it     (Verse 2) some people perceive me as a herbal twister maybe it’s the way I think creativity is my girl and I can’t resist her immortality came back when I lost my top and died listen up you primitive screw heads, are you outta your mind do you even know your kind find yourself, makes life divine  out of time, wait a second, I’m in a time machine,  I got all the time I need, wanna go back, and make time for me? Haven’t ya seen, the buzz you can get from caffeine Methamphetamines make minds obscene like a latrine The unknown third bean in the salad, watch out Stab you in the back with a phoenix talon Didn’t expect it, you shoulda wrote it down in blood with a pin Visional arithmetic, how every human wants their kin  (Chorus: Faith No More’s Epic x 2) You want it all, but you can’t have it It’s in your face, but you can’t grab it  (Spoken) You might not know what this is…………But, you know you want it……..and you know you can’t have it, but you’re willing to do almost anything to get it…………Sometimes, you gotta work around what doesn’t come…………but, always remember, it’ll get there soon enough.   Traffic  I’m gonna walk out into traffic With no red lights I’m gonna walk out into traffic With no yields or stop signs A walk out into traffic My life
