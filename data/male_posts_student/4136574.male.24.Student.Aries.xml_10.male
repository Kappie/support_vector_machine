I found a great two bedroom apartment near school with Elissa and Jamay. It's best to get away after a break-up, but without an easy way to do that I'm gonna try to fight it out for now. Jamay and I changed rooms. We'll switch rents now that I get my own room and I'll try to be roommates with Elissa. This is will interesting to say the least.  I do always seek greater challenges. I will learn to understand myself and control my emotions better than ever. Or I will fail again. I am not often a weak person, but I hope to keep from doing anything really stupid. Whether that's getting jealous, getting feelings for Elissa again, or what, I don't know yet. It'd be interesting to move in with some other friends if anyone else needed a roommate or was moving, but I'm not sure Elissa and Jamay could afford this place on their own.  Okay, so there's some more details I figured anyone not familiar with my story should know. The breakup was like 2 days ago. The relationship lasted almost 40 months. We'll see how long recovery takes. Living with an ex is a BAD idea, but we'll see how that works too. The lease just began and lasts through next summer. I won't have a job or income until next fall (have to graduate and take the bar first). So yeah, I hope I can preserve all the friends and social stuff Elissa and I have built/enjoyed together over the last few years. It is very lonely being single.  If these blogs seem somewhat upbeat for a recent breakup (cause they are), I'm in my first good mood for days. I think it's just becuase I've not slept but a couple hours in days.
