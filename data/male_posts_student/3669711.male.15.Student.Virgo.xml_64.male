Now, you might say "ewww.... very easy mode, you suck!!"  Well, i don't care what you have to say, i am thinking of completing it again, but first, i have to beat some other games i am quite close to, such as Splinter Cell (i think around 90% complete that) and Final Fantasy X (leveling up for Sin) and hrm.. there are others... FF9... third disc, not that far away... .hack//Infection... i don't know where the end is... so many games, so little time.  I must beat some more!!!   Well, for now, Splinter Cell is number 1, thats numero uno!!  The top priority!  Well, with that in mind, i'll stay away from my PS2 for a while.   Lates
