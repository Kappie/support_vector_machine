Earlier, at about two o'clock, my mom asked me to clean my shower.  So I cleaned the shower, and then I cleaned the sink, and the toliet, and the mirrors, and the floor.  Then, I moved to my room where I took all the sheets off of my bed.  I then re-made my bed, swiffered my entire room, cleaned my computer, and then I took everything out of my drawers.  I re-organized all of my drawers, and then I moved to my closet.  I vacuummed and I had nothing else to clean in my room.  I moved to my sister's room and I cleaned her shower for her because she didn't want to.  I just finished.  Sitting and thinking about if there was anything else that I could clean, it occured to me how strange I am.  Who cleans like that? Nobody--at least nobody that is normal.  I think that I might need professional help.
