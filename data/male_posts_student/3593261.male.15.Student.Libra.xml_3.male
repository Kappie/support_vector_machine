The rain has brought much chaos and trouble to the people.   Woke up at 6.30am, used the computer and took my shower. The cool wind certainly froze me. Went to school and the "misadventure" begins.  My team-mate, Nadesh , did not turned up. Damn..his knowledge for the trip could prove useful. Nevertheless, we strived our best to continue and forge our way to finish the trail.  Team-mates : Sayufi, Clement, Johnny, Ulric and me.    We went to some Indian shops. I can't remember what we did but we were told to wear those "scary little red dots", the puttu. I hid it within my fingers, cause I am very shy wearing it. After so much time spent on the trail, we took some rest and we were shocked to find Tinesh andhis gang in a nearby shelter. I realised that they were lazing around and had not completed a single quest. That was very horrible. Anyway, I had some fun on a fitness corner, and I was kind of pissed off when Tinesh said " Now I realised that you're wearing underwear"..  Hmm...we were late for the trail and we had to skip some parts. We went to Novena Square and had our lunch at BK.  We went to TTS Hospital to study and went home. Well, I am sorry I couldn't express much detail, I was too tired. =)
