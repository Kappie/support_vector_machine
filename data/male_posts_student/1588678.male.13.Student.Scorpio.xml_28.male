He’s the blond guy who’s always joking around and pissing people off. Well, when they had the reward challenge they brought in each cast member’s loved one. They would ask questions and the cast member and their loved one’s answer had to match and if they got it right they had someone else’s loved one take one step closer to jumping off a plank. Once the loved one’s came out the cast member and loved one hugged and said hi. When Jon said hi to his buddy, Jon asked how his grandma was. His friend whispered that his grandma had died. Jon just broke down in tears. Once he sat down he explained that his grandma died. Everyone was real sympathetic. After the reward challenge the cast members threw the challenge for Jon. So, since Jon won he got to spent the day with his buddy collecting information regarding his grandma’s death at a separate island. Once they got there and they were alone, Jon turned to his friend and said, “Nice job!” So, Jon’s grandma never died and he lied about it so he’d win the challenge. Before the game Jon told his friend to save him by telling him at the game that his grandma died so save his ass. It was great, Jon’s friend said in the beginning, “Your grandma died, dude.” It was hella funny! So Jon’s pretty safe for now. It was so horrible, and the best part is that no one knows that he lied. As bad as it was it was friggin’ geniuses. If you are into shows like The Mole, you’ll like Survivor. It’s on Thursdays on CBS at 8. You love it. This is Seth a.k.a. G-Funk signin out yo!
