Well, for some reason I cant seem to remember what I was doing on Monday, but I am pretty  sure I was busy...  But, anyways,  yesterday I went over to Mike's with Luke and that was the first time I had seen him since we got out of school.  By that point I was starting to wonder if he even existed and I didn't make him up...  Luke was feeling nice I guess because when we went out to the mall he bought me a meal, as kind of a birthday present.  Later that night I got the Spiderman 2 game, and holy crap is it great.  I love it, it's so much better than the first one and I don't suck at it.  I also finally got my new memory card, so all my storage problems are over.  So I guess that's it.  later...
