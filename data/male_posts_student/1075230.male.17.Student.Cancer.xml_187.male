If my dad wanted a child who was completely obedient to him, he should've gotten himself a friggin (I'm trying really hard to refrain from obscenities) robot. He'd fit right in a friggin dictatorship government. Award those that support you, kill those that don't. Not that he awards me for the things I've done right, but then again, he doesn't exactly kill me for the things I don't do right, so I guess it's kinda even.   At times like this, I remember an experience from childhood (Umm... I wonder if I wrote this in Blogger before... don't recall). A math contest was being held, and for like 2-3 weeks, my dad was making to a lot of math exercises. One night, I guess I kinda broke down and cried, and he hit me, saying something like "this is a math lesson, you can't cry during lessons!" The morning of the contest, I must've cried a bit, because I remember my eyes was all red and stuff, and my neighbour's parents (whose children was also participating in the math contest) was asking my parents what'd happen.    Well, anyway, I feel a bit better now, writing down stuff really helps ^^;; the only problem now is telling people that I'm switching to canto/mando... =\  some people were expecting me to be there and I told them that I would... I don't like breaking promises much... =\ *sigh* I wonder if I'll know anyone in my future classes...    oh, that kinda reminds me of another thing my dad said tonight: "are you just taking it for fun??" (note: though this seems like a question, he expects only one answer and I gave that to him) I said "no, I just want to try it out" (which was true, but this seemingly innocent sentence caused him to get angrier, don't ask) In my mind, I was like "Hell yea! What the hell's the point in life if I can't learn what I want to learn?"   ~Chronos (Cooled Down a Bit)
