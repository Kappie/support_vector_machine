Zak brought in his water gun, and the teachers were too dumb to realise it poking out of his bag all day lol.  The only lesson today where we actually did some work was geography, typical Mrs. Marsh.  We watched a few videos and messed around in other lessons, pretty pointless going in at all I suppose.  I've got a right old elephant for my next school tutor and it's gonna suck.  I got a few awards in assembly and I wasn't suprised that Mrs. Marsh chose two girls for her awards, again, typical old Marshy!  I'm having a barbeque tonight (in aid of my Mum's and Sheldon's engagement) and then I'm going my dad's for the weekend.  I'm gonna be packing for my hols on Monday and Tuesday and then jetting off on Wednesday :)  I better go and get ready for the barbeque...cya
