There are no banners promoting the newest energy drink littering the fences. In fact, there are no fences. Step one to the ex game, is to get an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend. Then, have a contest to see who can do the most damage to the other. Weapons of choice include: Weblogs, similar to this one. Being seen with members of the opposite sex, or better yet, the same sex. Asking your ex for dating and relationship advice. Sleeping with as many people in as short of time as possible.  And so on. This is the ex-game. Which I appear to be losing.  Today, what a horrible day it was today. One of those "I-should-have-stayed-in-bed-and-watched-the-price-is-right-days". Except of course, that today is Sunday, and The Price Is Right only airs on weekdays. I worked alone today, and had to go to the bathroom like you wouldn't believe. Of course, on Sunday, there isn't a single moment when there isn't  someone  in the store, so I couldn't even close for a few minutes. That kind of pressure just makes you hate everyone who sets foot in your store.  I'm sick today, as well. I think it's a combination between my neck, the lack of sleep, and the heat. I know it's not that hot out, but lately I've been feeling very sensitive to heat. I'm not sure why.  Yesterday, it has been 3 months since I began living the single life. Three. that's a quarter of a year. How time flies when you're not having fun. Also, today, is exactly half way through the year 2003. I haven't fulfilled a single New Years Resolution. Oh my.
