We started out making a song using Mikes awesome computer program called...I forgot. Well any way, the song kicked ass, and we didnt even finish it.  2. We went out side and burnt some of Mikes old clothing. We found a stick on a tree (go figure) and we pulled it off and tied one of Mikes pants to it. We then swung (is that a word?) it around in circles having a great time.  Then Mike said "Hey this is this Asian mans house, and he has a pool in his front yard, lets throw this torch into it." Hart, Kaj, and I all though it was a great idea. So like idiots we all ran down the Asian mans drive way, and threw the torch into the pool. Kaj then yelled "Quick! We have been I.D." (I doubt we were) so we then ran back to Mikes house.  3. Things slowed down, and Hart, Kaj, and I played Halo for about an hour. That was grand fun, it was Kaj and Hart vs. Me (I beasted them). After that grand fun, we went down stairs and had a milk shake (good stuff).  4. Kaj, Hart, and I were tired of sitting around, we wanted to burn some stuff. Kaj saw some toilet paper sitting around and said "hey lets burn that" and we all agreed it would look cool. We also took a tennis ball with us. Mike decided that we should hit a flaming tennis ball around so, Hart got a skate board, Kaj got a baseball bat, and Mike had a crappy tennis racquet, I had nothing.  We doused the tennis ball in gas and set it on fire, it looked kinda cool (just a flaming ball). Mike then tried to get it into the air, so Kaj could hit it, but the ball had burnt a hole in the racquet (we were night high so we laughed at this). Mike some how got it into the air and hit it to Kaj. Kaj (who has sucky aim) hits the ball and it hits me in the pant leg, and for the first time we saw the ball bounce. It was facking awesome! When it hit the ground some gas would fall off, leaving a fire trail. The flame then went out and Mike then doused it in gas and lit it again. This time we couldnt get it into the air, so we kinda played soccer with it.  Now the freaking awesome part. We set the toilet paper down, and rolled it along a little and doused the tail in gas (we also soaked the cardboard that the toilet paper is on). Mike threw a match on it and the whole tail lit up, it was like gun powder in action movies. The flame went all the way up until the roll and when it got there we started to kick the roll around. It burnt down and the tail of the toilet paper left this big black line. Mike kept saying that his parents would be pissed, so I said (while night high) "lets take off our clothing and put gas on it and say we were framed." That idea didnt work, so we walked to the house and found some foot soap, Mike said "lets wash it!" We all knew it wouldnt work, but we did it any way. Mike rubbed it on the black line until no foot soap was left. This didnt work....there was now a big white line. So Mikes dad would ask "Mike! Did you make that big black line out there?" and Mike would respond "Are you racist! Why didnt you notice the white line?" Haha night high rocks!
