You abandon civilization and magic technology so that you can... work out your upper body for 6 hours, get sunburned, and listen to your dad barking, "Paddle, paddle! Paddle right, paddle left, brake brake brake! C'mon!" You know what? Paddling gets old.  Second of all, I hate dealing with a sunburn. It's like an angry red reminder that I just wasted my saturday paddling a canoe in the company of a stepmother whose primary concern in life is which celebrity is dating which other celebrity, and a father who gave me 40 bucks and a T-shirt that doesn't fit for my birthday present. My 16th birthday. Now, I wasn't expecting a SAAB or space shuttle or something, but it would've been nice if he gave me a present that insinuated that my own father knows me. Just a pipedream, I guess.  You may have drawn from this digression that my weekend wasn't very fun. You may be correct. I just keep telling myself, "Two more years, two more years and I'll be hundreds of miles away." That and, "Two more weeks, two more weeks and I won't have to even  think  about sines, cosines, tangents, or diethyl-cyclohexatriol."  Wow, listen to me! Bitch bitch bitch. I should lighten up.  In other (lighter) news, Calexico is coming back to Texas (Austin) in September, so I'm psyched.  Oh, funny story about my sun-scorchedness. I was taking a shower (lewd!), thinking about something (not lewd, honest), and basically cleaning myself on autopilot. Hand takes scrubby-lufa-thing. Hand puts soap on scrubby-lufa-thing. Hand scrubs sunburnt arm with scrubby-lufa-thing. Eyes widen. Mouth screams. Brain says, "Shit."
