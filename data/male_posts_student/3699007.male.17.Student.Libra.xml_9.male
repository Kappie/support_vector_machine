Nobody is bothering me and I can do whatever I want to.  Right now, I'm playing PS2.  NCAA 2004, the game I am addicted to.  NCAA 2005 comes out on July 15, should be even better than 04.  This is random, but you know what pisses me off?  When somebody that is incredibly nice to you blocks you.  Here is what happened.  I IMed a girl I was good friends with in middle school the other night.  It was about 2:15 in the morning, actually.  We talked for about 30 minutes and then I went to bed.  We reminisced about some things that happened in middle school and how surprising it is who my best friends are now.  There was no harsh feelings between either of us, we had just kind of drifted apart and I was wondering what she was up to.  She was very nice to me, told me good night, etc. And I told her that we could talk late at night every night during the summer since neither of us had anything else to do and she said that was cool.  So, I began to notice that in the days after our conversation, she did not appear on my buddy list.  Knowing that she is constantly online, I put her on my buddy list for the screen name linked to SimpleMan8499.  Sure enough, she was online, at which point I knew she had blocked me.  I don't really care since I've talked to her once in about 3 years, but what the hell?  If you don't like me, tell me and I'll gladly shut up.  For Christ sakes, Amie doesn't have me blocked and I wouldn't say I was her favorite person in the world.  Enough on that rant.  Some other things- where the hell is Alex?  I haven't heard from him in like 2 weeks and he usually calls me more than once a day.  Kinda makes me worry about him.  Allman Brothers tickets go on sale this saturday morning and there is probably going to be a pre-sale toward the middle of this week.  3-night run at the Fox in September.  HELL YES.  Hopefully dad will pay.  I'll probably buy "cheap" $45 balcony seats since it's the Fox and you can see well from anywhere.  I hope he gives me the money.  He  did  pay $90 apiece for Jimmy Buffett tickets, a concert I didn't think was worth it.  Not many people are worth that, and certainly not Jimmy Buffett.  But whatever, it was a hell of an atmosphere and I didn't have to pay.  Got my SAT scores back.  1070.  Not good, not terribly bad either.  Makes me feel good that I got a 1070 and a friend of mine is 75th in my class and made a 1100 on his AFTER taking a $550 SAT prep course.  I made a 650 on the verbal though, so that is 89th percentile, which means I made 89% higher than everybody else that took it.  But the math was only 420, which makes me feel, well, like the mathematical dumbass that I am.  19th percentile, bitches!  Carbo's out of town, Alex has seemingly dropped off the face of the earth, and Blair is, well, I don't know where the hell Blair is.  Hopefully she is back from the beach so I will have somebody else to talk to, and hopefully she had a sweet 16.  My birthday is in not even 4 months.  I'll be 18, and I can buy cigarettes and porno, neither of which I will probably purchase, unless they are for other people.  Quite honestly, porn magazines are lame and a waste of money, as are cigarettes, if you really want to know what I think.  Sorry if I offended anyone.  If I did, too bad. :-) Ok I'm gonna hit the submit button now.  Tomorrow will likely be another Britt, Justin, and ASS-ley (I call her that because she has a nice ass) adventure.  Later y'all.
