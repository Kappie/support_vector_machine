The meaning and etymology behind the Germanic/Indo-European word God as used in English and its cognates (such as Gott in modern German) have been hotly disputed, though most agree in a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European form ʒuðán, which means something like "possession" or "inspiration", and could be related to everything from the old Germanic divinity Wotan/Odin to the Greek word khute, meaning "libation".  Taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God   I find it strange that its roots included possession, because what word is often connected to that? Demons, ghosts, etc, is it not? Yes, I really have no time on my hands...   Despite my own believing in God, I hate religon, and this page has quite a bit of stuff on religon.   www.jesusneverexisted.com    And now for a stupid religon site xD www.xxxbible.com No, its not about porn, its about people who want to make up for their sins. You should see some of the stuff these people are into, it scares me.
