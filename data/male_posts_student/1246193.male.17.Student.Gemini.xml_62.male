Instead of just skating in circles, I have to be on the constant lookout for Gregg and Ryan.  They find it quite fun, and funny, to crash into me and shove me up against the wall.  There are usually a few wrestling moves and I usually end up face first on the ice.  Not today, however, I was skating particularily well so they were having a little more trouble catching me.  I only got knocked down once!  I am so freaking awesome.  I didn't even fall when Ryan picked me up and bounced my head against the wall!  A little later through no person's fault but my own I ran into a door.  That was a riot!  I think a certain history teacher is probably thinking right now about how bad he feels for giving us homework over Christmas break.  And if he isn't maybe he should keep in mind my traditional holiday saying.  It goes as follows:  "If I don't like what I got-and my foot starts a tappin', I'll get a certain look in my eye, you might want to watch out-accidents happen, and people die!"  It isn't a threat, I am just putting that little ditty out there in case someone comes across it who was thinking of giving me shit for the holidays.  That's right Santa, If I get crap this year I'll take Rudolph's shiny little nose and shove it so far up your ass your rosy cheeks will glow brighter than the New Year's Ball in New York.  Then we can drop you from the top of a building and yell "Happy New Year's" as your skull cracks and your white little beard slowly turns a nice shade of crimson.  "Happy Christmas and to all, and to all a good present, damn straight."
