My first understanding of "metrosexual" was of a man who was concerned with the smallest details of his appearance, especially his hair, clothes, and fingernails.  But after some reflection, I'm not really sure if metrosexuality is not just a euphemism in Western culture to denote self-absorption in males.  Maybe as a neophyte to cultural jargon I'm alienated from its precise meaning, but no matter how I've tried to understand the word, it just seems like good old selfishness and pride.
