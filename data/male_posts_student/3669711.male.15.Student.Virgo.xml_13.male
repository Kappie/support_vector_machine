Looking through endless pages of br's and td's and headers's is not the best thing to do when you first get up. It sort of scrambles your brain for the rest of the day.  Just thinking about it, i see that it was a mistake.  Well, you can't punish me for my enthusiasm to get things done bright and early.  Trying to make a new template for your blog is also a mistake, especially when you are doing it in the morning.  Since it doesn't work like HTML you make yourself in notepad (adding pictures using the directory on your hard drive), it can be a bit frusterating. Especially when you are looking at a really got template, and you are like 'heyyy, i want mine to look like that'.  You can't just rip the person off, thats stealing, but if you try to make your own, it never looks as good, even if you have high ideals.  Well, enough of trying to make a new template, i've had it!  Heh... given up again, not unlike so many gentoo install attepts.    Speaking about gentoo, i just got the 97 page installation guide!  Thats right, 97 pages... of stuff.  Yeah, i don't even know whats in there, i have barily read the first three paragraphs, considering i haven't downloaded a live cd of gentoo yet.  And about that, i'm not even sure which computer it's going to go on...  my desktop deffinately not, it has too much important stuff that i don't want to get rid of.  My laptop, a much more worthy choice, although, i really don't feel up to formating it... windows is working great.  My other desktop (p2 256 MHz) is not what you call 'top of the line'... far from it.  Plus, if i use the minimal live cd, i won't be able to do anything on that computer anyways... no internet access.    Too bad... so sad... and all these choices are presenting themselves to me.  Should i acutally try linux, once more, or should i just stick with XP, what i know well.  It's always good to learn new things, and linux would be a new thing for me... but its also good to stick with what you know, and i know XP very well.  I should know XP, i've been using it for about 2 years.  One of the first who got it!    I might as well look into linux some more, or maybe i'll relax with some anime... the choices..
