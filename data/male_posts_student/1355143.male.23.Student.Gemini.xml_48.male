I juct checked out the pop-up that comes up when you sign in on MSN and it said that University of Illinois was 4. in the best party school in Hammerica. Utexas on the other hand in sixth place and descriped Austin as an interesting city that is perfect for students.  So do you really party more there than in Catalunya?  Hey just saw The Passion of Christ, really good movie, just to ruin the plot for you then he dies in the end... but not.  Later, Ãšlli
