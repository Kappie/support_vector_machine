Im great, had an alright holiday, it was wonderful weather but slightly boring here and there never mind ey. Got back and spent a couple of days with the guys and Charli who I missed terribly. Attened 2 thirds of the Big Weekend, where I saw some pretty cool bands, The Delays, Fun Lovin' Criminals, Bad Manners and Chas 'N' Dave. Alright so Chas 'N' Dave wer'nt the best but they were pretty funky. During Bad Manners we (meaning Me, Xav, Lee, Matt and Nick) all went to the front which was insane and we starting skanking which was awsome. Then During Chas 'N' Dave I ran into my brother and his friends and started dancing with them all which was really cool. After that me, Nick, Lee and Xav all went to my house and chilled out, played guitar and the such. The next morning whilst the guys slept and I went into town with my Dad to pick up a new spangly guitar, its silver, great pickups, clamps which equal wammy madness. Its a really gorgeous guitar. The guy who tried it out in the shop was insane when playing, anyhow got back and had a blast on it then we all went back to town for day 2 of the big weekend this time with Ben and others, alot of people pissed me off cause they were like "Oh, Bens coming..." and personally I like the guy, hes a nice person at heart and like EVERYONE in the world can get on peoples nerves, even I do and I know it. But yeah seeing Ben was cool, saw Charli too, then we all went to the stage area where I talked to my brother for a bit then despite somebodys whinning (were not sure who it was) we saw the Delays who in my opinion were absoloutly awsome. Their DJ has a great hat on and I kept screaming that I wanted it, never got it though never mind ey. I was talking to their guitarist whilst he was on stage which was absoloutly awsome cause he could understand me and first of all I asked him to get the DJ's hat, never happened, then I was telling him he was doing an awsome job. After that the Fun Lovin' Criminals were on, they were cool, some slow songs which did not appeal to me they played some harder ones that really got the crowed pumping and it waent crazy me, Xav, Nick and Charli really got into it. Meanwhile me and Nick noticed that certain people were just really not getting into it even though they obviously liked the music, but they had no spirit or enthusiasm. After that with much confusion involving a missing Lee, Charli's parents massive car, one of us getting out to meet Lee, a bus ride home and a helium filled balloon, we got home safely but not the way it should of ended up. Nick, Xav and Lee were meant to stay at mine but instead Lee and Xav ended up and Xav's house and Nick at mine. Woke up this morning, gave my guitar a go which was nice, slept a little more. Gave Charli a ring, and then discussed my rooms new decoration which is going ahead tomorrow. Done and Done, see you all soon.
