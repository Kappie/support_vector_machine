People thought in my freshman year that I wouldn't be good at sports because I was short and young, but on cross country I was one of the top JV runners ahead of a couple juniors and sophmores. Then in track I went out and got the third fastest time on the 1500m out of everyone on the long distance team. Also on my tournament this weekend I knew I'd be going up against juniors and seniors, but that made me try harder and I did better than most people [including me] thought i would. So i surprised them in two ways. First because of my age they thought i wouldn't do that good. Then also because of my sking color. About 50% of the kids there were black then 45% were hispanic and then 5% were white. Of course the stereotype that white guys aren't good at basketball came into play with a lot of the other teams we played so they weren't expecting me to be so good. So i was a short, young, white guy. Not a good mix, except for me it worked out. Well now since all those things happened why can't I fall in love at my age. One of my cross country team mates was talking about his ex-girlfriend and how much he loved her and how he didn't know if she would take him back after a year or so of being apart and I asked if he wanted advice or just words of consolation and he turned toward me and said "You don't know what love is" I couldn't believe he just said that. I, not know what love is" I love my family more than anything and i love my friends with all my heart. I also had a past love too. So he was out of line to say that, but that's in the past and I don't like to hold grudges, but it is my belief that you are never too young to fall in love...or too old for that matter. If you read  The Notebook  you'll understand that you can fall in love anytime, anyplace and under any circumstances. Gosh that is the greatest book ever written.  I love you know who  [and I don't mean Voldemort from  Harry Potter ]lol
