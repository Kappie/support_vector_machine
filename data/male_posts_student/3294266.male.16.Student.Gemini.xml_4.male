It was constantly advertised in 30 second promos, live reporters and repeats of the four venues. The radio promo went as follows:  121 bands. 24 hours. 4 cities. And TV2 is live there with ZM. National Anthem is held at the St James in Auckland, Avalon in Wellington, Canterbury Uni in Christchurch and Otago Uni in Dunedin...  Overall, in the 24 hours there was about 70 minutes dedicated to advertising and promoting the National Anthem live on ZM, including raving about the 121 bands. In reality, only about 3 bands were broadcast taking about 25 minutes of the air time.  Meanwhile, something far more important gained under 10 minutes worth of promotion over the same 24 hour period...  This week on The Crew: On Monday Janet Jackson joins the crew. [Clip]Hello is this Janet Jackson[Clip]. Janet Jackson on the crew. Monday on ZM.  Perhaps the station, which is a Clear Channel and Australian Provincial Newspapers joint-venture and plays 'Today's Hit Music' is really just a bunch of Zany Madness...  Maybe it never recovered after Paul Holmes was Disc Jocky at the radio station during the 1970's...
