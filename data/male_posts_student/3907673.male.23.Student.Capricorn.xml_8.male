Yesterday, for POC, learnt hw to cooking stew chicken, mushroom soup, and glaze veg. Hope that later i would be able to cook a nice dish out, hehe. Then yesterday, only got two class for me, one is CATERING SCIENCE, the other was as i said, POC.  Well, even though it was quite a gd day, it was also abit of tiring, from a whole day of standing at the counter. Think that's all for nw, would write again when i come back.  Cheers Thomas
