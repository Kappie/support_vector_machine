Well, I definitely won't be that's for sure.  I think it is totally shocking and we should be doing more apropriate topics in lessons than planning our own sodding funerals!  They are acting as if we are going to drop dead any second.  From what I've heard, people have been designing coffins, saying what music they want and everything!   Why don't we start planning our weddings, job interviews, christenings... and the lot!  No wait, better not say that or they just might lmao!  Why don't we focus on having a good life and have RE lessons on how to respect other cultures and beilieves (I certainly know a few people who could do with those) than plan the religious ceremony that our families will have to endure in the FAR future.  On a lighter note... Weekend!  Yay!  2 whole days away from school (lmao as if I haven't had enough time off already this week hehe).  I totally agree with what Becky said about the way things have sped up so fast at school.  The exams, coursework, and homework have been rushing past us all so fast it has been a very daunting and confusing experience for us all.  If the government really want an overworked and tired generation of youngsters going into the workforce, then they are definitely going the right way about it.  Stop giving us so much bloody work!  Anyways, I better stop ranting before I end up with a post as large as this mornings lol!  Buh bye...
