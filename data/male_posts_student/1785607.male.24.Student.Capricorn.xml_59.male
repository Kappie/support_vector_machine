I always knew something was fishy. U can sense it reading my posts, but at the end I ALWAYS made excuses for his behavior. So, yeah, I knew, but I allowed myself to get hurt because of love.  I'm getting tired of writing about it all the time I get in front of this computer, that's why the first three days I avoid it. Now, is getting colder, and this is the season I wanted to spend with him, is a romantic, melancholy, sweet and full of love one, anyway. I know I'm ok with everything. The good thing of all this is that I know now I'm strong enough; I have great friends that support me; I'm out to almost everyone, and I got to know a great guy that even though toyed with me I still care for.  It will take time for me to not think of what happened and not feel rage and sadness. I did opened my heart.   Mom is kind of trying to know what happened, but so far, is not something I want her to know. Is not for her to make judgments from my relationships. What makes me feel stupid, is that this is the first one I ended getting hurt and I don't care about it. I still care for him and that's why I don't want anyone but me, making judgments about him. Stupid, huh?   Yesterday as I was getting ready to go to school, I was watching sex and the city, and a line there got my attention:  "life is what happened while you are making plans" .  So with this in mind, I can say with all authority, and having last week as a reminder, that life is a bitch! I got so many plans, all of them never included a relationship, and BAM! It happened... Then I got so many plans for it, and BAM! It happened again... Now I'm single, with all my plans in the can and flunking all my subjects at school. I need to get a grip and start moving on with my life.  ... For Neil.  Sorry man I didn't have the chance to talk to you. I'm happy nothing happened to your family and their house. Don't be worried for me. Next time we'll have the chance to talk, for the moment, you know I'm your friend and if you need something just call. Love ya dude.
