I am so glad that school is out (the endless projects and finals burned me out)... but my gorgeous girlfriend of eight months, whom I will further refer to as Megan, is going to San Bernardino, CA to see her dad and other people associated with that side of her family... it's great that she is going to visit her dad, whom she only sees twice a year... but she is going to be gone all summer and I am going to miss her oh-so terribly. Summer is the best time to spend time with your girlfriend... and she is going to be gone. I love her and will stay with her (long-distance relationship, oh-yay), fidelity and all, until she returns in the fall... (no interesting camping experiences this year). Not only is Megan gone... but most of my friends... many of whom are dedicated band nerds... are on tour with assorted drum and bugle corps (all summer). So now I gotta go dig out the old pile of people's numbers (most are chicken-scratched on random papers), and see if I can get together with old friends whom I un-intentionally stopped communicating with after band-nerdism took over. I should tell the population of  dedicated readers  out there that I am a trumpet player (for ~ 7 years now). I will most probably be getting together with an old friend whom I went on a couple of dates with last summer (yes, a girl)... maybe help her with showing her 4-H pigs at the county fair... we are decidedly just friends, of course. Now that it's summer... I have no friends... I am a bored nerd... I will be posting more of these blog thingies to keep the  dedicated readers  out there busy.
