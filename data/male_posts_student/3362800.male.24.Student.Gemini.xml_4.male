These few days, I can't really get back myself from the sad mood. I thought I can, but I still always think of my loved one.I am struggling now.  Days are long,Everyday during the bedtime, i miss her voice,miss it a lot.  Anyway, now i just hoped that, I can be stronger soon... Time goes by,hoped that we can be very closed.At least, I know, she is still beside me and I can hear her voice.. But still,I really hoped to be couple....   Days are longggg.....
