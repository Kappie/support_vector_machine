(It is a massive 6 board map with about 50 squads in play, so I really need to think it out.  For the WWII buffs, it is a simulation of Operation Rosselsprung, where a combined force of SS paratroopers and SS assault forces are trying to capture Tito in Yugoslavia, defending by nothing more than partisans.  It promises to be gloriously bloody).  So since I happened to be in need of entertainment, I flipped on Dennis Miller and listened as I worked.  It's been awhile since I've watched, and he is really getting into his stride.  The show is really smooth now, and Miller certainly seems fired up.  He had Bob Dole on, which I thought was amusing simply when he announced that Bob Dole was going to be on!  Dole was sharp and funny, plugging the dedication of the WW II Memorial in DC today (and I really want to make a pilgramiage to see this).  Dole is an honarable man, and while I don't think he really had what it takes to be a president, he certainly brings a dignity to the discourse, and as we found out AFTER the 96 election, he has a sense of humor (I'll never understand why he didn't simply be himself during the campaign...he's funny and warm).  Miller casually asked if he was still popping the Viagra, and Dole didn't miss a beat, saying he recommends it and it makes your hair darker, better than Grecian Formula since he could never stand the taste of it.  It got a good laugh from Miller.  The rest of the show was pretty good.  The panel had a couple of people I didn't know, as well as Yeardly Smith (Lisa Simpson).  It was a little strange to hear the voice of Lisa criticize Al Gore in pretty strong terms.  I need to make the time to watch it more, but I'm always doing something else.  Over the next week while I game the ASL scenario, I'll make a point to turn Miller on.
