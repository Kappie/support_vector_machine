Several folks opted out of taking the exam once they received a book with the questions, answers, and explanations.  An even greater number of students began to walk out of today's post-exam review as it moved into its sixth hour.  We have seven hours or so scheduled for tomorrow.  After all this sound and fury, the test and explanation sessions' real benefits appear to be (1) inspiration of fear and (2) concept review.  We have had true success as to benefit number one.  Number two remains elusive.  To break the montony of our daily lectures, some of us have taken to examining each lecturer's appearance and mannerisms.  Rarely do we view professors in our videos; we are too busy filling in blanks and wrestling with faded memories.  Yet there are brief glimpses.  We have a small collection of celebrities, or at least their clones.  Steve Buscemi tought us negotiable instruments and secured transactions.  Tim Allen attempted to provide a post-MBE property review.  He failed.  In the nerdy world of law students, Erwin Chermerinsky's actual appearance in our Con Law review video was a something of a celebrity event.  Yes, we crave for something to add levity to our daily three-and-a-half hour review sessions.  Now I attempt to finish all of life's "little projects" in time for my target date of July 5, 2004.  All other work must end by that time.  The Bar draws near.  Still those books from the Easton Press taunt me.  Plato... Carlyle... Homer... and what must I read?  BarBri...
