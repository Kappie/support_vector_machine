Texas prosecutors had argued that the state was entitled to regulate public morality and that bans on homosexual acts were a longstanding U.S. legal tradition.   Seems to me that if Texas really wants to uphold "traditional family values," it should start by cracking down on heterosexual acts outside of marriage. ...but that would ruin the lives of too many politicians, now wouldn't it?
