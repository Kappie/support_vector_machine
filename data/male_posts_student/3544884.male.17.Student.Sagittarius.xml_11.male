She was like Candice but like from Guadalajara and that's all. She was even like her in the way they both always smile. They both think strawberryshortcake is an angel and i think both of them are sweet little girls. This two girls are crazy about little stuff, like for example this "Chibiusa" (that's her screen name) loves this Japanese series so much i don't know why but she does. And well Candice likes more strawberry shortcake than Chibiusa but she also has other little things she does that i love she does, like collecting things or having certain type of items, i don't know i think it's cool. They are different in that Chibiusa likes to read and i don't think Candice does but i know Candice likes to write and i know she does it great, while i don't think Chibiusa does. Also they would like to be artist, Candice say she would be an actress and Chiobusa sings so that's cool. I think it's cool to know there's someone out there very alike to Candice.
