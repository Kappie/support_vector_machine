I had to pause my game and see what it was. It was the mudafu**in teletubies, so i decided to do something rather not so nice to them.      I hated the teletubies because they were a bunch of hardcore losers. They had come to myashram to get a blessing, but couldn't find the door. I thought they were rather thick in the head, because my door, to the ashram won an award for biggest yet humblest door! I felt that they needed a punishment because of criricising my door, by thinking very  little  of it.          So this is the punishment they got:               When walking by...                                    When buggering me...                                 When getting on my nerves...               when they couldn't find moi door ala fantastique...                     When they criticised my door...                     When there was only one left... i did it myself...                                                   taught em' a lesson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
