Right now I don't have much to say though, it's the run upto  urlLink christmas  and I haven't done enough xmas shopping.. ah, I'll do it next weekend, and hopefully some in the week when school ends, any other term and it would've by now, but this ones the longest.. grur. Got an easy day tmz; music, economics, RE and Games - piss easy, hehe. Won splinter cell the other day, it was one of those games I started and never finished, but it was most easy. Oh, I got my clarinet grade 5 results back today, a very solid merit, 125 to be exact, 5 off a distinction.... back of the net. Mmmm, SiKth, I've been listening to too much SiKth, I'm gunna go back to some Patton soon, and then maybe create some bad music with Buzz and Goldwave, and add it to my  urlLink collection
