It was elitist and I didn't know what I was getting myself into. But, I did get inspired to write as I listened to some of the stuff there. It's a waste that I've forgotten the inspiration but at least I know that it's not beyond my grasp. I know what's wrong with my blog now. It's that I recount my daily activities so much that I've left no more room for my other writing. It's become a common blog. Nothing overly special about it. It's like this. I figure that my thinking deserves a special entry coz I want it to have an impact on you. And I know I cannot achieve that if it comes after my groaning over Jolyn or Zel. Not that they're any less important though. Oh, by the way, note to self : Tim, get over your anger at Jo's anger at you. Yes. Now that that's cleared up, I've decided that I should have less recount, more reflection- unless of course, there's something special that needs to be mentioned.  I just found out that Desiree knows Chris because they're old family friends. The bigger we get, the smaller our world becomes huh. Also, did you notice that the phrase "small world" is used more often than not, in situations where X knows Y and Z but didn't know that Y and Z know each other and when both Y and Z know each other but didn’t know that the other knows X. Um... yes. Think about it. We don’t usually use the phrase when we discover after the inquiry to discover if we have common friends.  Shyama's gone. It was a happy fare-thee-well and there were no tears because those who should have been shedding them, bravely suppressed them. I think I wouldn't be able to do that. Shyama's a special girl and I'm proud of her. Not jealous. That's something new for me too. I guess that's cause I love her. I'll be waiting for her when she comes back. I remember crying non-stop when Shane left for Australia. I couldn't stop for a week. It turned me into blubbering trash. Oh! ALSO! Anand told me that there might be hope for me to be able to apply again next year because they're making arrangements to meet the permanent secretary of defense to discuss something. I really hope things turn out well. I'm so thrilled!  "The average person thinks he's not". Perhaps it's true, but I was thinking about it on the bus the other day and I figured that that's something a jealous person would say in he attempt to bring other's mentalities down to fit his ideal equilibrium.  That sounded good. I'm back!  I woke up at 1.25pm and it's 4.15pm now. I have to get to work. Instead, I'm playing with my bass, my drums and listening to Sunday morning over and over again. Desiree is great. I miss her lots. I have 4 physical geog essays, 1 human geog essay, 2 war lit essays, 1 othello essay, 1 prac crit essay and 2 tamil essays. That makes eleven essays Tim! GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO! Will write again tonight.
