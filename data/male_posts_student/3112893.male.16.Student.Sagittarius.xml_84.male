My dad and Erik were going to eat at this burrito place, but it closed when they got there so they went to the mall instead to get something to eat. My dad, being the thoughtful dude that he is, brought me back some Panda Express. Of course, after finishing the meal, I looked for the fortune cookie, found it, ate it and read the fortune as I munched on the cookie. Rarely, anymore is the fortune in the cookie an actual fortune, but rather some comment about what kind of person you are, or something non-fortune-like like that; mine was one of these. Anyway, my cookie read "You are cautious in showing your true self to others." Upon reading this, I denied it as if it were totally absurd and impossible and thought "Pfft! Yeah! Right! Me?! Me not honest about who I am and showing it?! 'HAHAHA! Laughable, man! (In the voice of 'Jesus' from the Big Lebowski)'" Then I thought about it a while longer and realized "Huh, how true it is. I actually am kinda hesitant showing 'what I really am'. I guess it's because I don't have a real 'am'. I'm kinda like a chameleon, I change colors to match my surroundings. In fact, I'm so much like a chameleon that I actually believe that morals are relative so that I don't have as hard a time changing surroundings... I must not like showing that whole picture because I think that people won't accept me because it would be made clear that I'm just a sheep in wolf's clothing -- eeeh, I mean wolf in sheep's clothing... or something like that. Wow, that's one hell of a fortune." Don't get me wrong, though. It's not like I think that god was planning on me seeing this cookie or something. It just happened to kinda fall into my lap and it's just a very odd coincidence.  I wonder if my want -- well, more of a need to fit in is a bad thing?  That is all. -- Feanor
