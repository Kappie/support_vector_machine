Do you think Kerry might want to know, if he didn't already?  Would it be useful for Kerry to realize one of his campaign advisors on National Security has 'paper-attracting pants'?  If Kerry has been blindsided by this, then I wouldn't be surprised if the leak came from the Clinton camp.  Kerry's poll numbers have been stronger than expected, and a Kerry win would be the end of Hillary's chances.  Given Clinton's history, is it unreasonable to think this is possible?
