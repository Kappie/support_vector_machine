But I didn't sleep. None of us did.  Yesterday I also ran into a bus stop pole in the mist and hurt my shoulder, at about 2 AM. Then the poliece took me name, address and D.O.B. for hanging around in the middle of a roundabout at half 3 AM. But it was a good night.  It's Friday again, where's the week gone? I've just had another power cut, this one was only 4 hours, not as bad as last time! They could at least try and predict when a fault will develop heheh. I'm off now, very tired.
