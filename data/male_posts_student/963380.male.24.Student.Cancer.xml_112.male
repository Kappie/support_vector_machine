However I was just informed that if I'm interested in keeping myself upwardly mobile in the company, there is a meeting I should be attending tomorrow at 8 am.  If you're unaware, tonight is the night that the clocks "spring forward" (note to self. Shoot the fucker who came up with that as a witticism).  That means that I would essentially be attending work at 7 am. When we don't, according to scale, open until 10. Being there three hours early is potentially the stupidest thing I can possibly imagine, especially when I've probably got more skill then the chap dishing out the tips.  Hence I will be at work tomorrow at 10. IF there is any sort of flack distributed, I believe I'll call HR and see what the hell they have to say about it. If I've got to be there three hours early, you're going to fucking pay me for it.   On another note, Zelda is good. So is Star Trek Deep Space 9. DS9 is a little like paradoxical candy. It's tasty, it's stimulating and you really can't get enough. If candy were like that, the world would be a better place.
