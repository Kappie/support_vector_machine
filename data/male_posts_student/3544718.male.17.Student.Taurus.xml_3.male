Honestly, I've thoroughly enjoyed the time that I've spent on  urlLink The Homestar Runner Website . I've spent hours and hours looking at the  urlLink Strongbad e-mails , and they're pretty hilarious. If you don't know what Homestar Runner is, then when you have free-time, just visit the website. I've watched a few of the toons, too... they're pretty good. Anyways, that's my random rambling about Homestar Runner, I hope you're a happier person for it (under no circumstances are you to ignore your friends just to watch another cartoon... only watch it when you're bored and have nothing to do...). Ok, goodbye. urlLink
