Not really...but I feel like hell...staying up till 2 AM in the morning and waking up at 8 the next morning is not a good idea, I've been feeling tired the whole day, the only way keeping me sane...is probabely coke and work...very tired indeed.  Got a call from my traveling parents, and from what I can tell, they have been doing way to much driving and way too little sleep. It looks like it takes about 10 ours to drive to Quebec from Toronto, and when they finaly got there, they had trouble finding a place to stay...very troublesome, and the hotels there is very expensive...$120 a night...  Err...as I said in my last post, I finished the handbook last night and sent out the version 3, well..today I again got e-mail replays. But only 1 with a very minor change, so I guess that made my happy enough...so all I need to do is the add the cover and schedual and I am done. But printing present a problem once more, because I do not know how to print it in a book fashin...err...and they want to see hard copys tomorow...got to get this problem figured out...and make sure I don't screw up...  The stress and the deadline have been deadly...after I present this thing tomorow...I'm taking a couple of days off with this and going to enjoy my self and camp that's coming up in a week...and actually take a break during my vacation...  Anyways...going to go back and finish the handbook and print it correctly (hopefully) and get to bed before 1 in the morning...
