So many poems i've read by people, and they would be great, except they replace "you" with "U" and "are" with "R", stuff like that, and it bothers me because it looks like they're being so immature and not sincere. Here's a little snippet my friend had in his profile... I'm not copying word-for-word because... well... he's not on.  "I love all of u. Y does god take away all the people u love?"  I was just thinking, "Are..... you kidding?"  Apparentally, he wasn't, but whatever.
