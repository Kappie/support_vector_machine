That was a mistake because all my memories are gone except for one. It was persistent for sure and would not delete due to some encoding problem. It was also an entry that I didn't write, but rather someone else's words used to describe a shared experience. In a way, I'm glad I wasn't able to get rid of it.  Since then I've created the ourmovieyear Livejournal, which I only use to write about films. In these entries I also try to explain how I relate to elements of these films, with hopes that it will help myself and others understand me. I'm not sure how effective it is, but it's still a fun way to get some writing done.  I've also made a few random pieces of writing, which I never published online until now. These would have been journal entries, but for some reason, I feared that the content wasn't meant to be accessible. Today that changed as they can be found below.   Today we had a band from Winnipeg come into the studio to perform some music live on-air. I stood between two amps watching the mic output levels while these two musicians created abrasive music that could be the soundtrack to a nightmare. I mean that in the best way possible. During that time, I got to wondering if previous events in my life were different, if I would still be the same. Previous people who were influences on my life have come and gone after varying lengths of time. No doubt they have each left their mark. So basically I was wondering if some of those influences who were only around for a few months would have drastically affected my life assuming I had the priviledge of knowing them for longer. Maybe I would have been living in Vancouver without any sort of post-secondary education. Maybe I would have been living in the GTA just trying to get by with a couple of minimum wage jobs. Maybe I would have been living in Windsor with a similar situation minus a steady girlfriend. Around this moment I snapped out of my daze while the music continually assaulted my ears. The story to this moral: I miss all the previous participants in my life, and I really wish they showed some interest in still knowing me regardless of our differences.
