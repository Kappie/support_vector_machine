Most of the Internet problems over the weekend was caused by a worm exploiting the latest in  Microsoft  security holes. Good news that the attack doesn't seem to be malicious, but nevertheless it been giving huge denial of service worldwide. While it seems to be easily fixed, I'm wondering why this 6 month old hole was not fixed earlier? I'm not sure if this is an oversight of the server administers  or of  Microsoft , but at the risk of sounding bias, I'm sure you can tell where I am pointing my finger to.  Work Update: I managed to finish off one assignment, just have to reorder the reference list thats all. I am however waiting on the other assignment, still not all the details are in yet. I did get updated about the oncoming tests the weekend after the CNY, so looks like I'll be busy for next week and the week after as well. Starting to look like there is a pattern to how my school works. They like to dump on us last minute stuff especially the two weeks before the one before the test. Guess I'll have to be more aware for the next module. Good think I only have one to do after this two, but I have to study all three for the exams in April.  Aside from school, I did manage to learn something new in the form of installing and running basic desktop functions in Linux, that a good thing. I should learn a new skill every month for this whole year. Wonder what I can do for next month? Maybe finish off by learning the server side stuff of Linux, or hopefully Windows XP Pro. Of course lets not forget about Driving.  Hmm That should be kinda cool.  Gotta get back to work now. Will update again later.    >
