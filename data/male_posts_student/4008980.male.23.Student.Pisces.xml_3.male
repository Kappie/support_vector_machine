It'll also probably be the last comment, because I'm telling both of you who read this that this is the last post I'm making solely dedicated to one comment on one of my other posts. So there's no reason to comment anymore. None!  Unless you want to make me feel loved.   Love me!  The both of you that read this are now officially weirded out. Scroll down to the original post to see what that means.  Cheers to the other side of the Atlantic. I'm international, baby.
