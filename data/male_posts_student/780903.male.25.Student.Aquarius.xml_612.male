In order to get people to sign up, they give out candy.  The amount of organizations is staggering.  The amount of candy is staggering.  I sat at the table for the a cappella group.  The Alliance for Independent Feminists was on our left; the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (see: "Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show" from Monday) was on our right.  They each got more than double the number of signups we did.  "Do you sing, are you a feminist, or are you a vegan?"  "I'm all three."  "Oh boy."  I think the Alliance for Independent Feminists got as many men to sign up as they did women.  They're going to be part of a grassroots movement to transform the group into the Alliance for Dependent Feminists.  The Vegans got lots of sign ups because they were giving out homemade chocolate chip cookies.  There's no meat in chocolate chip cookies.  Ten Organizations That Don't Exist Here:  1.
