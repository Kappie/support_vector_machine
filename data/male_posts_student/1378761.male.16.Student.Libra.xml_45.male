I have to make a copy of the two DVD's I have at home right now, Runaway Jury and Save The Last Dance because they are due back tonight. Time Warner Cable will be here tomorrow MORNING to inspect the cable lines I put in my house and install the splitter needed for Roadrunner! Yeah! So now I can finally download my movies!! I have to stress morning cause it will be around 9 o'clock and I usually don't wake up that early. I guess I will have to go to bed early tonight! I think the cable guy will freak out when he comes into my office (that's were the main splice is) because its weird downhere. I will prob never come back here again. Oh well. The electrician was here yesterday just as I was leaving for work. I had to move one of my desk out so he can get to the power panel. I think it is official, my house is falling apart. LOL. He was kinda amazed at my office and just laughed at it and said that I will be making a fortune in the future because I am a really smart and intelligent kid. Ha that's funny! He liked the wires and boxes on the wall. I guess I will have to wait to see what the cable guy says. I usually laugh at Time Warner because we have this thing for hating them. Poor people. It's mainly because of there prices. But we now have TSC coming into town. I guess it will be a while till that get to my side of the town. I applied there for a job, then a couple days later in the newspaper there was an article about how they are bringing all these people over from Wapak to run the office in St. Marys. That kinda pissed me off but o'well. That would be cool to be a cable/telephone tech. I would die for that job. Guess I gotta wait. Well I better clean the office up a bit. The electrician made a mess and I never got around to clean it up yet. So I am office  until the next time comes, >>ERIC
