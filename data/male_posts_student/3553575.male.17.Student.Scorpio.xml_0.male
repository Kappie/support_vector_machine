He was waiting a table of about 10-12 men, all of which are your typical "I hate the blacks, Jews, and Mex-ee-cans. WOOO! White power!" type guys. They, together, had a $100 bill...The waiter, being Asian and not white, got 50cents as a tip. That's just really shitty, yes?  And then, when a different table was payign at the register, the guy paying couldn't even look the vendor in the eye because he was hispanic.  Sometimes I really fucking hate living in the South.
