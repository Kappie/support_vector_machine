In no particular order (I rather like randomness)....I saw Red Dragon on Friday night....it was everything I expected and more....I put a review over at urlLink  OJ's Message board  in the "Give a review of movies you just rented/watched"....for once I wasn't let down by a movie that I had high expectations for.....  I went to a party Saturday night at this Greek house at Vandy....I saw the gorgeous Jylana, who informed me that she occassionally reads the mess I type here....I felt pretty special....I must admit I kind of dig it when I find out that someone I completely don't expect to have taken notice of this website tells me that they know about it....  Said party was pretty cool....I was slightly intoxicated, but no worse for wear....Vandy has this house that apparently the Alphas, Omegas, and Sigmas share....I have heard various rumors about how they got the house....the one I will choose to propogate is the one that was told to me by young Ja'Nera (who I saw at the party)....allegedly the frat that used to own the house was suspended and forceed to give it over to the Black frats because they were taping "bumfights"....I had no idea people in Nashville were doing the bumfight thing....my boy Corey sent me a link to Bumfights about 6 months ago....who woulda known the fall out from that would be so far reaching?.....ahhh well...  Every week I make promises that I break....cleaning up my room, typing more frequently here, going to class every session....let's see how I do this week....
