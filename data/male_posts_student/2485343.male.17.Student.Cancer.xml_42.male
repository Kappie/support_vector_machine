We sit here, hurry up and wait. the fates of our demise in this, the romanticies that two can feel in  an hour of death. death in a part of you death in a part of me  the light with a dim soft glow penetrates the dark or what isn't there. My hands amuse their way across your hands and keep you from falling apart. Maybe I wasn't meant for this maybe you were meant for me. We forget anything and everything as the clocks tick the time away you wont leave me you're a sucker for anything acoustic
