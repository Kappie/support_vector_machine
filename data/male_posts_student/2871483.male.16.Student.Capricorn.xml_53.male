Who wouldn't want to lay in bed for hours on end trying so hard to get to sleep, but to no avail?  Who wouldn't want to be in an endless state of half-awakeness?    Who wouldn't want to be physically fatigued aall the time?  Who wouldn't love to have viciously disturbing nightmares everytime they accually get to sleep?  I have put up with insomnia since I was really little, and I'm fucking sick and tired of it.  The nightmares are terrible.  The worst of them being this reoccuring nightmare, where I kill and mutilate with a knife anybody I care for.  I keep cutting them, I can't stop, and I'm smiling, while they're screaming in pain.  I sometimes awaken from that dream to find my house empty, familly being gone somewhere.  Many of my friends have recieved late night phone calls from me.  My doctor says it's probably a fear of seperation or lossing the ones I love.  That makes sense.
