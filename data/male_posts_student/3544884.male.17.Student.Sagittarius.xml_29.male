I guess my mother knows that by letting me drive that van is like a price for me. Im hoping of getting a better job and buy a new car, im interested in something like a focus or a beatle. I really prefer the VW but first i shold be thinking abotu hte job. Im going tomorrow to ask for it, pray so i can get it...for reals pray. I want that car so much. I cant wait to put my hands on my own car. Im going to pray tonight, really bad, really bad to get that job, to get that car.
