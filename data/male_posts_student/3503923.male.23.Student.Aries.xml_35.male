A whole host of scientists, star-gazers, meteorologistsand Ulrika Johnson look-a-likes have tried in vain to explain the weather. It' s acommonly peculiar phenomenon amongst Brits to begin discussing the high science of weather whenever confronted by the cul-de-sac of an awkward silence. To stumble into a conversation about whether comes as naturally to a Brit as sporting failure. The discussion also tending to be as bitter as sporting failure; bitterness about the rain, dissatisfaction about the heat, not to mention the horrors of the 'green-house-effect' that most men point to when their marriage failsor car breaks down.    Remember Michael Fish before the Great Storm of '87 assuring the public that everything was fine. 'Remain calm people of England, this thing is passing over us, hold onto your hats and say your hail Mary's. For all you windsurfers and cloudwalkers out there, this could be your once-in -a-lifetime opportunity to catch a good wave, or the passing dark cloud, but be quick remember, it's only passing. Famously, as we all well know, Mr.Fish was made the national scapegoat for his erroneous reporting. Poor Mr.Fish had to bear the brunt of the publics wrath, carrying the sins of a nation single-handedly, that is, if we look into the term 'scapegoat' literally.  "Bible: A live goat over whose head Aaron confessed all the sins of the children of Israel on the Day of Atonement. The goat, symbolically bearing their sins, was then sent into the wilderness."        "In a broadcast prior to the storm Michael Fish, responding to a viewers query, assured viewers that a hurricane which had just affected parts of the USA would not affect Britain (it didn't). He then added, but having said that, actually the weather will become rather windy. Which, of course, it did."      "15 million trees were felled and whole forests decimated. Buildings suffered severe damage and ships were driven on to shore. 16 people died as a direct result of the storm damage"      So when the weather turned a bit sour and events started to look pretty pear-shaped, people began projecting their ill-feeling towards none other than our humble weather-man Mr.Fish. As a consequence, he turned into the sacrificial goat who was destined to roam in the wilderness with the burden of wrecked homes and lost lives. England needed somebody to blame. By escaping from reason they were able to avoid a sense of sorrow, transmitting their anger to the wandering goat; Mr.Fish.  I don't know much about astrology, don't know much about economy, don't know much about the rainy season, but I do know; that blessed be the one who sent the weather. They say that something in the troposhere is affecting your day down here. Whether in the sun due to the Azores High, caught in the chill of the polar jet stream, walking on moon-lit streets, holding a torch in the dark, seeking answers from the sky; hold true, never being dragged down by SAD.
