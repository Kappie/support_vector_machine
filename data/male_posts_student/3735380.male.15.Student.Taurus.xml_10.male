Look at it this way. It takes at most $1 to stamp a CD, with its plastic case. To put the paper catalogs and stuff, it should be about $1 extra. The total comes to $2, or at most $3 per CD. So why are we paying $20 per cd? They should at most charge about $5 per CD.  Or at least they would. If they had a major competitor.  Their unreasonable pricetags like $19.95 or whatever is completely insane. First they charge 3 hours of earnings on your paycheck, then they start suing people.  Here's the situation. The RIAA has no major competitor. They can raise their prices to about $25 or $30 if they wanted to.  This is why you see McDonalds next to Burger King. Walmart across the street from K-Mart. The BP station about 10 feet away from the Shell station. Capitalism is a world of competition. The rule is to sell the best goods at the lowest prices.  The RIAA does not follow that rule. Instead, they have tiny similar companies that are almost bankrupt that are competing against them. In fact, they can even sue without losing customers, because the customers have nowhere else to buy music from.  The situation is that unless someone steps up to compete, things are going to get worse.  Leave your comments. I dare you.
