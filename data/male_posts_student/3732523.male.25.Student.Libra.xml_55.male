Last night I finally came to the decision that I'm going to start going again, and so today I pootled down to the gym for a quick session on the cross-trainer and some sit-ups.   I've also gone so far as to book a gym induction session - the third one I have booked now, I just hope I actually get a training programme this time. The first time, I got told they wouldn't give me a programme until my chiropractor had signed some form saying it was ok for me to use the gym. The second time, the instructor cancelled, but I never got the message so ended up with another wasted visit. I'm hoping it's third time lucky!  So next week I'm planning on going to the gym and perhaps taking some classes in an attempt to start getting fit again. My plan to walk to and from work every day has been scuppered by the British summer - or rather the lack of it. A little old lady at the bus stop even asked me where the summer had gone and that she'd never known a summer like it. Personally, I think it's my fault. I've bought a few skirts recently and I guess the sun has decided it doesn't want me exposing my legs so has hidden until I give up the insane notion of wearing skirts :( It's not that I'm not a skirt person, it's just that I generally wear jeans. My mum always makes the comment "oh, you DO have legs then" whenever I wear a skirt, that's how rare it is. But my problem has not been a hatred for skirts, more a case of not finding a nice skirt, and now I have - about 4 of them! The next problem is finding shoes I can wear with them. Not sure trainers are going to match all my skirts...
