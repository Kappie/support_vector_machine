First of all, GAAAAA the oxymoron combinations of Leftist/Fascist/SuicideBomber/Know-Nothing political jargons mixed with some of your peculiarly molded mind has transplanted the great picasso like abstarct ideas into our fantastic debate blog. Emerson would laugh so hard.  Secondly, I think you were the first person to mention that gay people are more loving than heterosexuals. "Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher. Marriage is something that this group has to fight for". Although I don't deny that statement at all.  Third of all, for affirmative actions, I think Asians (especially oriental Asians) are as bad, or even worse than caucasians in lot of cases. Go figure. I actually wish I was white. Heh being a minority without the minority benefits and without the majority race ADVANTAGES is like a bogus race to me. WOH NEXT NINE HOURS KNOW-NOTHING SUPPORTERS PLEASE JOIN ROB MUILENBURGE! PROTECT THE INFALLIABLE RACE OF BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED CAUCAUSIAN MALES! Oh yeah, you HAVE to be STRAIGHT. NO GAYS ALLOWED!
