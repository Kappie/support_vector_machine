Sorting, filing, and having dust allergies... it's just enough to drive someone to the edge then drop them off right in front of it with no money. I went on my scavenger hunt. We got a girl arrested, stole a sherrif's promotional sign off his fence (which ended up in he and his wife chasing us down a sidewalk in their bathrobes), and (I came up with this) did a rendition of the last supper at McDonald's(TM), with Judas smoking a french fry. I was not being sacreligious, don't give me any crap. My team won (of course) and we enjoyed doing it. It was not a Jackass(TM) type stunt thing, though. I hate that show, even if it is actually funny sometimes. I mostly just hate MTV(TM). One team did get kicked out of Wal-Mart(TM), though. Did you know that it's against the company policy to take still photos or videos in there? I think that's sort of interesting.  Note: I apologize for all of the retarded (TM)'s I put on here, and for my spelling and grammar, which, after so long in school, still need work.
