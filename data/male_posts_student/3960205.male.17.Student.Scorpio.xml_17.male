Come 'o' White  come 'o' Black See my glory, nothing do I lack Spiritual thoughts, you get in me Picturesque beauty, come here and see Tells you my people's intelligence: "You can't continue with your negligence"  Even your ancenstors, came from here I hav spread knowledge, far and near Today I reclaim my respect, 'cuase I've imparted wisdom to each and every sect. I've never asked, for supremacy over the world Never will I ever ask for it I wan't to live with you in harmony What I just demand . . . is respect . . . What is just demand is respect . . .  - urlLink Nikhil Kulkarni .
