Brooke wasn't able to come to Awana 'cause she had to study, and now we're getting back from Bible study so late we're going straight to bed.  Last night we had impact in our new church.  Well same building but remodeled.  It is so kewl.  I'm eating a brownie Brooke made, Mmmm.  This weekend we're going with Brian, Andrea, and Mattathias to MN.  I'll try to keep up with the blog while I'm there and let you know what's up!  Ok, goodnight.
