There's an upcoming film festival at school and we need people to get into it, so I'm going to (hopefully) make a "preview" movie for Monday Morning Meeting, which will probably consist of me making a complete fool of myself in my struggle to fit several genres into about 30 seconds. But it'll be good for a laugh. So...  So....life has been strange lately. It's neat having a baby around the house, but it's also a lot o work. But thats boring stuff...not gonna write about that.  There's a story in there somewhere...Oh THERE IT IS!!!....no, no that was a guy in a gorilla suit....damn gorilla suit...  I'm sorry about that last post, just ignore it. I'll deal with it. ....but then why did I bring it up again?  I want my dreams to come true. Not really my day dreams or hopes, but the dreams I have while I am asleep. They're the best things ever. Either that or dream forever.  I've been thinking about trying out for Ensemble next year, but there are a couple of things holding me back. The first is time commitment, and the second is that if I got in, would I really be an assett or would I just hold back somebody else who could of used the spot more? I love acting, but it's not really what I plan to do with my life. I feel that if I made it, I may take the spot of someone who could really take advantage of the training to build a career upon.  hmmm.......teenage social life is too complex, especially with school in the mix. But teenage social life wouldn't be so large if it weren't for school, would it?  //signoff
