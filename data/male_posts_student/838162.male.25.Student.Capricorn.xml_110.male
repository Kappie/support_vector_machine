They then throw in a photoblogging service that allows photos to be posted with just a few clicks and no html. Just like the one in the post below.  There are other additional features to the service as well that is pretty cool. Such as direct connection to your friends to share photos and chat with them about it MSN/ICQ style. So no more trying to find ways for  DaMan  to show off to me his photos from his latest holiday (all 9megs worth), we just both connect using the  urlLink hello client   and he can show me each photo at time, discuss them while both of us are viewing the same picture (so no more misunderstandings) and I can then op to save to my disk which photos I want.  Totally cool. If there is anything that can get me back into using my digital camera more often, this would be it. I highly recommend this to anyone with a digital camera, don't forget to add me to your list.
