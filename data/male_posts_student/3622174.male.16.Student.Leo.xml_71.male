Alright, here's some valuable information for those of you who get bored on a daily basis:   -Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online : I'm starting a brand new blog tomorrow, called Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online.  This new blog will be all about the internet, and what you guys can see and do on it to minimize boredism time, so you don't end up like me and post "Absolute Boredism" posts on your blogs.  This new blog will not replace The Blog of the Bagel, but will be kind of like its lesser half.  It will contain links to cool sites, reviews of the best web games, and more.  It'll be updated every other day, while this blog will continue to be updated every day.  It will also feature a brand new design, and you should be able to find a link to it in my profile, but I'm not sure about that yet. ----------- So, what have I been up to today?  Well, aside from falling asleep for about 3 1/2 hours and just now waking up, I don't think too much has been going on.  I sat through and played Zuma for a few hours (get ready, that's my first review in the BBTDO), and I've just talked to people all day.  Not much fun there, right?  Oh well.  My driving days for drivers ed are quickly approaching, and once they do, I'll know that summer is nearing its last few weeks.  Not like I want school to start, but, this summer has just dragged on forever.  I feel like I've even been out of drivers ed for about a month already, and its only been a week.  Maybe its better that way, I don't know, but, I just need something to do.  So, if you start to see three or four entries here per day from me, then you'll know that boredism has absolutely struck me.  Maybe if I do that, I'll get my freakin' Gmail invitation that I'm dying to get.    Now, the one thing that will be coming up in the near future is new features to the Blog.  I'm looking for addons that will include something like a quote of the day or something.  This blog is somewhat boring now, and I just want to make it look a little better.  Don't expect a new look (this one is just fine for a while), but, do expect a couple new features to be coming to the blog soon.  For some reason, I'm still really tired, but, if I fall back asleep, then I'm going to be up all night again, and I really don't want that.  So, I'm going to try my hardest to stay awake, hopefully through dinner, and then go to sleep a little earlier than normal.    Still nothing for what day I'm going to Universal, but, it's going to be within the next two weeks, because my aunt is going to take us down there.  As you have undoubtedly heard, I am eagerly anticipating getting on Revenge of the Mummy, and even Shrek 4D, which I've only been on a couple times since it opened last year.  Now I've found out that its definitely Islands of Adventure that we're going to during yearbook camp, which is awesome because I haven't been there since we went there for camp last year.  (Unless you count Halloween Horror Nights, but, thats different).    Well, I'm going to sign off here for the night.  Hopefully, this being my 11th post, I'm getting close to my Gmail invite (I'm just dying to get one, now I can get bigger attachments and stuff).  Maybe by managing two blogs, it will make the situation better and I'll get my invite sooner.  Who knows?  Not me.  So, that's it for this edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  Remember to check this blog out tomorrow morning for an announcement and a link to the new Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online.  Trust me, it will give you something to do if you're bored, and its definitely worth the read.  You'll find out stuff to do online that you'll never imagined.  Sorry guys, no porn links.  I don't want to get kicked off Blogger, I really like this blog tool.  So, until next time, later!
