SO EASY!! i really thought it was going to be harder than it was. after i finshed the pre-cal exam, i just decided to pay a visit to mrs. wyigul "hey mrs. wyigul, i want to take my Ap bio exam" and then she's like "oh, i haven't written it yet, come back 4th block" and then i'm like "sald;fjlsadlk". so i'm stuck here in school with nothing to do (yeah!...NOT when it's your last day and you could be home right now), almost ready to graduate, and i have to wait to take my ap bio exam.                                          -this high school just doesn't want to let me go
