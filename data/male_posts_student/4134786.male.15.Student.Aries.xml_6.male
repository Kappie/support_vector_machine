A heck care attitude. That's probably the biggest problem. People just don't care.  Before i continue, I reiterate: This comment is entirely  personal  and should not be taken to have the  slightest official implications .  Late for rehearsal? Never mind, I've got an excuse, I can just stroll in loudly, complain that there isn't a stand/part/chair, let the door bang shut, interrupt the rehearsal for something about as important as peanuts.  Wrong entry? Who cares? I can go on entering late/out of tune/on the wrong note cos there are another 10 people playing the right thing. Or an approximation. Besides the 1sts/2nds/violas/cellos/basses are screwing up so badly that mr sze won't notice me.  Violin needs repair? Soundpost dropped? Perhaps the cello needs tuning in the middle of the rehearsal? I don't really give a damn. Since I can't project, mr sze can't hear my mistakes. Even better. I can't tune in the middle of the rehearsal, so I'll just stone there.  I can't stand these attitudes. They suggest that anyone who cares can just **** off and stick his head into the nearest dustbin. Worst of all, some people with these attitudes laugh at people who don't. Who care. And that's really discouraging.  Ok let me admit this. When it comes to doing stuff for my house (moor), I always happen to have a rehearsal for some obscure concert happening 2 weeks from now. But it is against my principles to actively  discourage  people from participating. From bothering. I usually make it a point to smile sheepishly and highlight my general apathy towards the house  vs.  the other's enthu-ness. And  that  makes people care about their house.  Perhaps I've been too nice on previous occasions. Perhaps some people read my comments and think "aha I agree but I bet he's not referring to me". You know, sometimes I might be? So here's the list.  Some violists (especially Nicholas): notable for late entries. "quite gone" is zhaohan's assessment of Nicholas. In my view you don't care about being among the worst violists the world has ever seen. Nicholas I believe you've been caught not watching/entering by mr sze many times before. But do you listen?  no . Do you care?  unlikely .  zenn  please  work at it. Life isn't a bed of roses.  Violinists might do well to improve their  attitude . Shawn, maybe you're not as stuck-up as Junhong (yes Junhong you can be pretty pissing at times even though you are extremely pro), watch it. Being pro doesn't entitle you to arrogance. Look at Adriel.  Back desk second violinists should wake up. Really if you don't give a fig about making music then I suggest you go and join a uniform group. RISE is really undermined through the efforts of people like some of you. If my comment on you is outdated and you really feel you've improved, show it.  Cellists. Most of you don't give a fig either, and would rather be flying kites at Marina. Edmund and Matthew - you are neither competent nor do you contribute much. If you really want to be a contributing member of RISE you should wake up and start paying attention to lessons with your teachers, and during rehearsals. Same applies for some sec 3s. Sec 2s are generally fine, but could be better. Jonathan Muk I have no idea what you're trying to do. I have no doubts about your ability to lead the ensemble, but  musically  speaking you have much  unrealised  potential, which doesn't mean anything.  Bassists are  painful .  When I started, we had 'sectionals' from Jan to Feb '02. Basically what I had to do was to learn the bass on my own, since mr sze only had the time to give me about 3 lessons (no more than that) and qing xiang didn't know his stuff that well either (sorry qx, but that's the whole truth). I went for  thirteen  lessons  paying  the full price for  every one of them. And I bought my bass in  April . During rehearsals since I "couldn't play" I sat around feeling neglected. This was pretty much the situation until perhaps May. Perhaps very few people remember that. That I was sitting in the back of the LAR with the air-con not working, with the weird new smells of sweat-soaked cellos and totally new people, in a completely new school, all the adjustments, everything.  You guys have it easy. No instrument, who cares? School pays for your lessons, which don't achieve anything anyway. Kuangnan and Yuze, since you don't practise between lessons, you're always back at square one at the next lesson.  Bassists are almost  expected  to be substandard. This is WRONG. Totally, heinously wrong. It's far better to aim high and miss rather than to aim low and hit. Get an instrument. A teacher. Some lessons. Go and audition for TO. Take exams. Be disciplined about your practice. Either love your instrument passionately, or hate it equally passionately (i hate it). Know it as well as you know your maths or science. Find pieces you like, and play them. Above all, "practise and improve" is what casteels told me in my YO audition. That applies to everyone.  I have this feeling that no one will bother about reading this anyway. Or think about it. I just felt I had to let go. These are observations I've gathered in rehearsals past. Problems like these will only become more acute in coming rehearsals. Musicians need to have discipline. Zeal. Passion. Fire. Artistic talent. Pride in their craft (NOT arrogance). and skill. Respect. Sensitivity.
