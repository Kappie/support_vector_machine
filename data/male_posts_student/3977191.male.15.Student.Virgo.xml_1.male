So I go to work.  When I get on break, I call Lindsay about the concert.  This was  our phone call:        "Hello"   "Hey, Is Lindsay there?"   "Speaking"   "Hey, I just wanted to let you know, that for the concert tomorrow night, that jeremy and his date won't be able to make it, So it will be just us. I just wanted to make sure that was Okay".   "Oh, I'm not going"   "Why"   "Well, I decided to go on vacation instead"   "Were you planning on telling me?"   I assumed you would figure it    out."     I hung up on her. Stupid bitch hoed me. That just really dug into my skin. So now I had a spare ticket. Conveiniently, everyone I know has *something* going on. literally. EVERYONE. I have to have my damn mom drive me there and back, and I wasted a fucking ticket.    Then to top it off, I got a write-up at work today.  And I was stupid   ,    I Signed it. I shouldn't have signed it, it wasn't something i was at fault for. Yet one more example of me not thinking and being a complete and utter tard.    The only thing that at ALL helped this out was having 60 hours of music on my computor, and a Really good friend. Thanks DeBro.    I really do suck at this whole "life" thing.
