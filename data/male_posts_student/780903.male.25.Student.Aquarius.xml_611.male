The Insta-Law-O-Matic Casebook Condenser removes the following words from your casebook:  Court, precedent, statute, legislature, justice, judge, "your honor," law, laws, legal, illegal, legality, illegality, the letter "l," all Latin words, three-pronged test, dissent, appeal, appellate, obligation under the law, although, despite, because, all sentences longer than 10 words, all words longer than 10 letters, all paragraphs longer than 10 lines, all cases longer than 10 pages, all decisions by justices older than 10 years, all footnotes, all question marks and the questions that precede them, all parenthetical remarks, all case names, and, of course, the letter "v."  This reduces the typical 800-page casebook to a 4-page booklet, suitable for reading while on the toilet, eating a balanced breakfast, or on the way to your final exam.  And, the makers of the Insta-Law-O-Matic Casebook Condenser have a risk-free money-back guarantee.  Score lower than an "F" on your exam, and your next Law-O-Matic Condensed Casebook is absolutely free (shipping and handling charges may apply).
