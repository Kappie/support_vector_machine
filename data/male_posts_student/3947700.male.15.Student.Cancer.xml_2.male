I just started watchingbecause my parents finally let me (and I got a television in my room). So my historical knowledge cannot compete against those who have been active watchers for a while.  I do keep up on the current stuff, though.   If you wish to reach me, you can email me at  urlLink benpitch@gmail.com . Any comments, though, are asked to be written on the blog. If you have a personal question, some new info, I can be reached at that email.    The site that I credit most of my knowledge from is  urlLink www.lordsofpain.net . This site is great and I thoroughly enjoy it. I have also visited other sites, such as  urlLink www.wrestlingnewsworld.com .    I highly recommend you to visit  urlLink www.lordsofpain.net  to get up-to-date information on the WWE and other wrestling subjects.    Well I guess that's it! Off to blog!
