What does it say about us that the ad I'm currently looking at (in another window, of course) says, "Help us cure  urlLink Crohn's  and  urlLink Ulcerative Colitis .  Learn about these diseases."  Maybe Coco had ulcerative colitis.  Maybe they know about UHS's incorrect diagnosis of my chronic appendicitis as a possible ulcer.  But it's probably just Josh's crazy med school talk.
