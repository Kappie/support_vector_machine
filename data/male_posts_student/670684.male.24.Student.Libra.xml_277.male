(of which I will return several, I am sure)  Well, my computer decided to delete everything in my My Documents section.  That means, everything I have written in the past two years is gone.  Every paper, every note to myself, every bit of official documentation, every screenplay...all gone.  I have some backed up, and some of the important stuff printed out, but everything else is blamo gone.  And I am fucking pissed.  The books will help soothe the wound.    I would like to express my sympathies for Mrs. Kolman today, as her husband passed away last night.  Mrs. Kolman was the most important teacher I had in high school, and I can't even begin to thank her for the impact she had on my life and lessons she taught me that help establish who I am today.  It's trite, and that's too bad, because it shouldn't be.
