Officials blame Bush's tumble on the soil, which they said was "loose" because it had been raining. However, precipitation records for the area show no sign of rain.  "We will get to the bottom of this," said Bush, "and find the people who did this." Bush did not comment on the Iraqi situation. It is now known whether Bush will put the training wheels back on his bicycle.
