First the modem's drivers won't work. Not a big deal, I wasn't going to use it for internet acess anyway. Then the network acess card for my LAN quits. This is a problem. Gotta have a LAN. Then, and here's the kicker, for no reason at all, when I start the computer it tells me that the cpu fan has failed and that it will not start up. Well, that's just plain bad. Then I decided to try starting it yet again about a day later, and it starts up with no problem. Ugh. But now the mouse's drivers don't work. The tech service guy told me to exchange it for another one when he couldn't get it to work. Thank God for that.
