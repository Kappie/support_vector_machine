LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE     Take my photo off the wall  If it just won't sing for you  'Cause all that's left has gone away  And there's nothing there for you to prove    Oh, look what you've done  You've made a fool of everyone  Oh well, it seems likes such fun  Until you lose what you had won    Give me back my point of view  'Cause I just can't think for you  I can hardly hear you say  What should I do, well you choose    Oh, look what you've done  You've made a fool of everyone  Oh well, it seems likes such fun  Until you lose what you had won    Oh, look what you've done  You've made a fool of everyone  A fool of everyone  A fool of everyone    Take my photo off the wall  If it just won't sing for you  'Cause all that's left has gone away  And there's nothing there for you to do    Oh, look what you've done  You've made a fool of everyone  Oh well, it seems likes such fun  Until you lose what you had won    Oh, look what you've done  You've made a fool of everyone  A fool of everyone  A fool of everyone   TIMOTHY   Timothy, I took your place Timothy, cause it's such a   waste Timothy, we found your spaceship Timothy, it's the farthest you've ever   flown  Never used your head To find out what this whole thing meant  It's not what   it seems But it is Timothy where have you been? Timothy where have you   been?  Timothy, where did you go? Timothy, the boy can throw Timothy, we found your   spaceship Timothy, did it hurt when you hit the ground  Never used your legs To walk   Tround in this whole big mess  It's not what it seems But it is Timothy where have you   been She cried in the kitchen To let you go Timothy where have you been  Missed   your photo Missed your birthday too Missed your photo  It's not what is seems  But   it is Timothy where have you been  She cried in the kitchen To let you go Timothy   where have you been  Missed your photo Missed your birthday too Missed your photo
