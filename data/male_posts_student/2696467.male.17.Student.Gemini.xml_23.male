I'm thinking of renting Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, or Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge tonight. The original Max Payne was one of the best games I ever played, second only to Knights of the Old Republic. So that should occupy my time. Me and my dad (or if you are an English teacher: My dad and I) might go to a motorcycle show tomorrow in Maryland so that should be cool....  Anyway since last time I posted not much went on, I guess I had a few experiences with Vicodin, which was alright, and other then that I didn't do much. so for now I'm gonna go.  Later, -HAZE-
