Let's discuss the Prom first, just to be unusual and to follow continuaty. The Limousine was absolutely brilliant, though I suspect they serve higher quality Champagne in American Diners the ice surrounding the bottle did taste very nice - it also kept my right-foot chilled throughout the entire night. The meal was okay, nothing special really, I mean the Yorkshire Pudding was so obliviously  not  cooked from frozen, the only truly remarkable thing about the dinner was the fact that nearly all the waitresses were dressed up like very, very cheap porn actresses. In case anybodies wondering, I'm only being mean cause my finger is bleeding profusely. The rest of the Prom Night was taken up with dancing, and i loved every single minute of it, especially Robbie Williams' Angels when I got to dance with Steph - YAY!  Lol. Onto King Eds. I'm very happy to let all you people know that I made some new friends, well, three to be exact. Hannah and Georgina were the first two friends I made, we started talking after I discovered that the labels in the room were "Jam-Free" and hence the Anti-Jamist movement was made! Andy probably refuses to admit my existence, or breaks out in tears at the mention of my name, he's a terribly funny bloke and I want his hair. Oh, I've gotta talk to the College People about Schools Experience (I'm not sure I'll need it if I want to go into H.E teaching, but I'll have a nose nevertheless) and also to scout there opinions about me electing Computer Skills/ICT as my 5th A-level option.  Oakies... I think that's the catch up over and done with now, so onto today!  It was dear old Garry's Birthday yesterday, and in celebration of this momentous occasion we went to ye olde UCI to see Shrek 2. Garry, Stu, Lucas, Pete, Perky, Kali, Bethan, Crystal and myself went along. I'm in two different minds about the movie, I found it amusing, but I was slightly dissapointed by it's predictability and it's repeated ideas. However, I do realise that I'd be critical of the movie whatever it was like because of the high opinion that I hold for the original and as such, I suggest you listen to me about this even less then you people normally listen to me :P. Oh!! Some, somewhat scandalous news, Pete-Er has asked Kali "out" and Kiki said yes to him. I realise that's probably the only interesting thing on this comment, and yet it is the only thing which only has one sentence describing it, but that's what I'm like - I have misplaced prioities :P. However, good luck to the Pete and to the Kiki. To the It and the Itetta... well, there really isn't anything I could wish upon you that would be extreme enough...  Anyways, I must start my weight-lifting and then get my ye-little body into bed!  Have Fun! Martin J.
