As soon as the tournament started they made a big impression by beating the hosts Portugal in the opening game...then after getting through their group, they beat off defending champs France 1-0, then beat the Czech Republic 1-0 in the semis, before completely outplaying Portugal in the final (a re-match of sorts from the first game of the tournament).  So...GO GREECE GO!!!  Erm...what else happened today. Oh. The street BBQ. What a joke. Jack (apparently) got so bored he went off to stalk Emma Mullen instead. I watched the Wimbledon final (which Federer won in 4 sets, damn good match). Even the table football was boring. And everyone left to watch the football. Oh, and the Estonians won the world wife-carrying contest again. Erm, yay?  Bah. Even this is getting boring. So...I'm gonna go now.
