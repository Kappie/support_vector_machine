Some photos: -  urlLink Fluffy  (clouds) series -- 4 pics. -  urlLink Strawberry Fields Forever  (shot in Liverpool)  Some sculptures: -  urlLink Taking the line for a walk...  · (A dog, lol)  urlLink Fist Of Power  · (My fist.)  urlLink chicken  · (It's a chicken, really!)  I also submitted a  urlLink Beetle resource PNG  for others to use in their deviations if they want to.  Lastly, I resubmitted these two old photos because they had been deleted due to a category/section misplacement: -  urlLink Valentine - 01 - Oh!  -  urlLink Valentine - 03 - Hmmm...   Do you like my deviations? (I'd appreciate if you could either comment on them on devart, or else on this post.) :)
