However, while searching for nonviolent tortures, in particular  urlLink chinese water torture  (No, I am not a BDSM enthusiast before anyone asks), I discovered a few of the more unsavory forms of torture that existed back in  urlLink the good old days  previously unknown to me.  What could be crueler and more homoerotic for the inquisition to use than the  urlLink Judas Chair ? (other parts of site nsfw) And the polar opposite of the rack, and one of my personal favorites, is the  urlLink Scavenger's Daughter , a metal brace designed to slowly crush someone to death in a position where their knees are pressed against their chest. (Impossible to find a picture online that isn't from a bondage website)        I did some research, and it turns out sleep deprivation actually can make you go insane.  But here's an even scarier thought:   urlLink It can kill you.
