Now, I've watched people play Halo for the last couple of years now, and let me tell you that I feel like I should know the game.  Nevertheless, I took my time by stealthily observing the moves, behaviors, and strategies of my dear, Halo-obsessed comrades.  Just so as to give you a minor glimpse into just  how  into the game these people are, I rang Jeremy's doorbell, waited about 20 seconds, and then knocked.  I got a rather faint, "Come in," so I walk in.  No sooner to I step foot inside than I hear good ol' Chip (and you have to know Chip to be able to understand what comes after) who's screaming at the top of his lungs "MY ONLY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO KILL YOU ALL!!! DIE!!! DIE, YOU ALL!!!"  Man, and I thought t-ball moms and dads were intense!  So after a while, at Jeremy's suggestion/urging/command, I picked up a controller and joined in the game.  I knocked off one guy during the first game (and one game can seriously last forever), but spent most of the time trying to figure out how to move left, right, up, and down and look in those same directions.  I was completely lost.  Nevertheless, while I was just randomly testing my weapon, I happened to hit one of the enemy.  Score!  Second game, I wasn't so lucky.  In fact, I got shot and killed so many times that I should've looked like a bad blend of swiss cheese and ketchup (thank goodness for Instant Rejuvination!).  Yeah, I decided during the endless, embarassing game that it was time to go ;-)  Well, I'm off to go enjoy my first movie as a SENIOR with all my cool SENIOR friends.  Um...yeah, I can already tell I'm going to annoy the crap out of my own self.  '05 Fo Shive...er...okay, maybe not.
