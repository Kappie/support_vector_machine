So I guess I'll do this one up like the rest of you.  Today I woke up at 9:36 I know this because I own a clock. I didn't go get a job. I ate subway for lunch. I cheated in poker and made $100. (okay maybe I didn't) I gave up TV today. TV has way too much advertising especially when people all ready pay upwards of $35 for basic cable. So lets do the math lets say you have 4,000,000 customers in Northern Ohio, that means you make.....$140,000,000. For 140 million can't Wide Open West pay Kotex for less advertising, it's all profit for Kotex and I don't have to watch bad commercials. Either way how much advertising does Kotex, Trojan, Pepto Bismal, and Invisaline need. Suffice to say if you walk into a store these are the corporations you automaticly see bacause they pay for eye level placement. Think about this too, you see a Kotex Commercial look at the demographics. Skip all male viewers, Menopaused Women, Prepuberty girls, and now the girls on the 4 periods a year pill. (I know about it from health research.) Now think of how small an audience you get. Now assume that these women only need your product during sex, once a month, during your stint with braces, or during your dieareha. Next time you watch TV count how many commercials you see in a 30 minute show then multiply that by 20 (seconds) the divide by 60 (seconds to find how many minutes you lose from these "fine" products) Now join me and Boycott TV for a week. Email me if you do.
