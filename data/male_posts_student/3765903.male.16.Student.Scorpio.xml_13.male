I NOW cannot talk due to the state of my teeth and I am also able to remove them! It trully is great... I'm even going to buy/steal a posh glass in which too put them in each morning! Arr, Ye Rapskaligans!  Wow! I'm a Pirate Grandad!  Ohh-arr! My back doth creak!!!!   Anyway, I just thought I'd blog toi proove my existance  in this world and to apologise to the many people who I was supposed to have contacted by now...  I am very sorry but i actually have been busy either, chasing a job or fighting back the urge to kill at home... ahhh... what a wonderful life it is to be me!!   Have fun ye all,   Martin J. - The Margerine Zombie     PS: Wow, I haven't written on here bout how great it was to go around Steph's for luncheon and to go bowling!! It was fab!! I almost felt like I was accepted as a normal member of society!! Thank you to the Churms house for putting up with me, but especially mine king (K)! WOW! Also... the cinemas today was pretty rock'ish! Well... 'part from the movie being crap... but still, it was very fun and i hope you enjoyed it as well Steph and Jono :-) .... 'till later....   "Ohh-Arr! My back doth creak!"
