I suppose I could just go outside and play basketball by myself or try and hang out with my sister and her friends. Fuck no I want to do something fun. I want to go to the beach with Craig and look at chicks. I want to hang with Alyssa and.....uh...do stuff. I want to go to mall and chill and buy stuff. I want to get my guitar. I want to go to boarder line. I want to go to the movies and see The Village, I Robot, Anchorman..something! I'm bored so much that even writing seems fun. Anyway lets see what I did today.  Woke up to my sister and Sara (my neighbor) looking at me. Sara was actually laying next to me in my bed, but it was still annoying. So I decided I'll wake up. Showered, dressed, etc. My mom and dad brought home a new bookshelf thingy. So I had to help them move it in to the house. Fun shit right there, let me tell you.  Then I got online and talked to Alyssa and Alex and everyone. I got bored of that and watched the X-Games. Got bored of that and decided to skate. Alyssa called me while I was skating, so I talked to her and skated. I tried to ollie over a push cart but it was too high. I hurt my legs. Haha, I got hurt. Then I got an idea.  Yes and then I had the idea of skating off my roof. But In the act of setting up the ladder I was yelled at so...no dice. But I did manage to hurt my collar bone when I did a kickflip and landed wrong and the the board come and crack into my bone. Now it's all sore. Ok I'm bored of writing for now. I'll post more later. Later gators
