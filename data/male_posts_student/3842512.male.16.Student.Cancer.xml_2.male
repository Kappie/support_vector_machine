You may be wondering what's up with the name "Shatt"..Well, to make a long story short, my friends took my name, Matt Shuster, switched the first two letters of the names around and got Shatt Muster. Now I go simply by Shatt, because despite my deepest efforts, they refuse to give the name up. I've already started ranting and raving! The blog's purpose is being fulfilled! Anyway...because this is my first post, you won't find much in the way of...well anything,  please give me time to build upon the blog to make it the best it can be, of course that will never happen, with progress and all, so feel free to check back periodically if you wish! And as a side note, I would like to thank my cousin for being my inspiration for this foray into the world of blogging. I will attempt to post his best work, and the blogs that I believe express my thoughts, and beliefs also.       Shatt
