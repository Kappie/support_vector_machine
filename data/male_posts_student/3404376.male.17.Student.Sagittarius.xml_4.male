One good thing that came from the trip: Some of my mythology came to me; unfortunately(or not) after talking to Maylilly about it I've realised that it sounds a lot like Genesis. I'll post a copy of it once I am able to express it in a more eloquent form, either that or I'll publish it on my website at least. More good from the trip is, I've evidentally gained a few fishy(freshman) friends..lol...    OH, I also got my OWN(thats right, its just mine) bank account finally, this one my mom can't mess with! On top of this I got Condition Zero! It is a lot better than the constant complaining from some people would have led me to believe, in fact I prefer it over plain CS(1.5 or 1.6).  -Aryan
