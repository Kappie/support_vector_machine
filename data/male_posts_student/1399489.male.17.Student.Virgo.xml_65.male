IT wasnt very eventful though.  I didnt really do anything until 11 30 when i started cleanin up from the family that was overhere.  Then at 12 i got to talk to jes that was good b/c i had felt like talkin for awhile, sounds like shes havin a good time too :) im glad b/c i was kinda worried she wouldn't i like it when she has fun with all her girl friends.  After i talked to her, i semi worked out b/c i was lazy and then sat around illegally downloaded about 35 songs (i went to the music billboard and just got most all of the top 10's lol) and then burned a cd and then i showered and headed to church.  I was figuring i would just got home but then tripp katie and erin showed up and invited us out to dinner.  At dinner (at Ocharlies) it was Nick (clem) katie erin tripp mark lee quinten and then chris showed up and so did jermey.  Bryndan was at church but he never came to dinner,  he was out pimpin the ladies lol.  its all good though im good with my current lady situation.  and THEN after that (yes there is still more haha)  me and nick bought almost 100 worth the groceries for the xbox lan party on tuesday and the camp out on wednesday.  it was great fun at walmart.  now im home writtin this thing.
