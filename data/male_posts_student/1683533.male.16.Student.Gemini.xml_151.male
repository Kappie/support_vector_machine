I think the main problem is I have these limitations, Marty hates emo and pop punk and pretty much anything that doesnt scream now, and now I have to try to make sure everything I am writing he is ok with.  I remember how it used to be fun, and sometimes words would flow out of me, now it seems like chore, and I just sat in my bed today and thought how fucked it all was and what I am gonna do.  I fell asleep before I could think of anything.
