Next game I bowled a little over a hundred. And I still can't throw straight. Next game I lost to Neil. And that is really bad. Neil, ..to put it as blunt as possible, sucks. We never speak of that game again.. And the last game I bowled, I lost to a little girl and a little boy. They were at tops 8 years old. The girl looked like she was maybe 6. And i still lost by at least 20 pins. So, there goes my career as a pro bowler. *sigh*.  2. Not even Staples likes us.  So we figured since we suck at bowling, we could walk over to Staples for something to do. Well, my idea of sneaking in the fire escape didn't fall through, so we went around to the front entrance. And there we see that it's closed. And it's pretty cold out too.  3. Put your money in the pool table so no one else plays.  We must have waited an hour to play pool. Just one game. But no. Stupid Bowl Arena should put a half hour time limit on billiards.  4. I am an idiot.  So after we were tired of waiting to play pool, we said "Well what else is there to do?" "Let's walk over to Weis and buy cotton swabs and glue and make something" So we go to Weis. As we were walking around, I was getting a little hungry. So I grab butter scotch krimpits and coffee cakes for the trek back to the Bowl Arena. (Yes you needed to know exactly what I bought) So we didn't get the cotton swabs anyway. Well, we were going to check out and yesterday was my first time using those self served check out machines. This is where I proved how stupid I really am. I'm standing there trying to figure this machine out looking like an idiot. First I swipe the item over the little laser thing. Nothing. So I look on the screen. A button said "Input Item Code". So I press that, except I have no clue what the item number is. So I cancel that. Next I see a button that says "Help". Well at this point, I guess it's safe to say I need help. I push it thinking a little tutorial will appear on the screen. Instead I hear an eerie, way to excited woman's voice coming from the screen that says "Help is on the way!" I look up and this light is flashing. At this point I'm ready to just put the food back and just leave, but along comes this helpful worker who helps me. Instead of explaining what I did wrong, he just grabbed the food, swiped it through the laser thing, and my order was done. What I spent 5 minutes trying to do, he did in 5 seconds. He came back later to make sure I was gonna pay. I'm surprised he didn't take my money and put it in the machine for me. As you can tell, it's amazing how well I'm doing in school. It's even amazing I made it to tenth grade. And all that was for 2 dollars worth of food.  5. Even if you live only a half a mile away, get a ride if it's below 10 degrees.  Yes it was painful even standing there waiting for the ride.  6. Watch out for birds.  Neil's dad's car is a perfect example of the wrath of birds. I counted 15 places on the windows alone where birds crapped. And when I got out of the car, it looked like the hood was white. It seems the birds have very good aim. I can't even work a self serve machine at Weis but a bird with 1/4 my brain can aim and crap on a car. Well, I think if I tried I can crap on a car too, but I'll save that for another post...
