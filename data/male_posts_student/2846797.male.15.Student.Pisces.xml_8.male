Today after school I held clan tryouts for like 3 hours and out of all that time I couldnt find one single terrorist group that could kill me 3 times in a row on the Militia map. And if you know the game being Counter Terrorist on that map is really close to impossible. Maybe I just to high of expectations. Well after that I had a hockey game. We tied 4-4 and we fount out our team names. I get to be the 'Viperz' yay! Yah anyways. I guess that all my $.02 for today take it for what it is.
