I liked their name, Slick Shoes.  You want to know what else I like?  urlLink This!  These guys look pretty cool, and I would really like to hear a song of theirs just to see if they are good.  I think all bands should have music on their website so people can have a listen to see how they are like.  I saw The Day After Tomorrow today with my mom, and it was good.  Good special effects, funny at certain moments, suspenseful, and even has a nice little moral at the end.  For some reason I thought of Mr. Friedrichs when I saw this movie.  The best part of this movie had to be when (get this) Americans started crossing the border into Mexico illegally...hahaha.  It was like bizarro world.  Anyways, I have to go my sister is bitching at me to get off and I have a shitload of homework to do yet. adios
