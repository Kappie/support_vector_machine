Everyone was quite excited for the stash that was laid out in front of them - like the previous vendor fair there were serious gym bags full of *stuff*. Who doesn't love that kind of thing? I don't know. Someone looking like Bannerman won a PT cruiser - seemed very upset about it because he'd bought another car the week before - sounds like something that would happen to Bannerman too.   Another strange thing - I could read in the dream. Someone named Murray - but not any Murray I know (even the last name was the same - the person wasn't) had to leave early and asked me to take notes for him. He forgot his gym bag - I *read* the tag on it. I've been told (well, my source here is an episode of the animated Batman in which Bats realizes he's in a dream because he can't read the newspaper  - so along with this source - a grain of salt, please) that you can't read when you're in a dream because reading takes place on one side of the brain why dreaming takes place on the other. I'm going to investigate that.   I'm sick of being sick. I really want these tonsils out. Strep every few months sucks.
