A prefect discovered my fingernails and forced me to cut them...   After disposing my nails, my form teacher took the opportunity to abuse me for being late... Saying "Who are you? Are you from this class?" and "Please introduce yourself!"... Okie, the first subject - Malay Language... The previous teacher migrated to West Malaysia, bah, will miss his jokes. The new teacher, a serious one... Bad. He spent 2 periods explaining boring stuff to us. It was a miracle for me to listen the whole morning without sleeping.   The next period - Geography. I passed Geography but was a mark less from my target. The teacher, still as hot and aggresive as ever... Hot as in sexy and aggresive as in "rowr..."... Hehehe...  Modern Maths... Mr. good guy wont let me retake. I was 2 hours late for the test but I managed to get 16%. Screw him.  Whoooooo! Got 64% for Basics of Accounting and I finally passed Commerce! 64% for PA and 46% for Commerce... W00t.  The rest? Failed Moral. Yay, I am a moraless human! I am proud to be one. Yay.  Going home on a bike with a friend. At least I didnt have to walk past the dogs' alley. Bah, I hate dogs.
