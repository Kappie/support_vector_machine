Also, our theatre troupe, in the meeting yesterday, decided to do the play 'Juvie'. It sounds really good, and ought to be fun. Only problem is royalties. It's $50 to do one show, and $30 for each show afterwards...We don't have enough to do the two shows we want. But, I know we'll be able to raise enough money! ^_^ And, I've still not enough cajones to ask the girl I like out...Stupid me. Well, that's all, yes? Bye, now! ^___^;
