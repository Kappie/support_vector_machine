We went to the nude beach next to Robert Moses and JESUS THAT WAS GROSS! We were hoping there'd be hot naked GIRL AS IN FUCKING FEMALE teens there but all there were was ugly and fat naked women along with a shit load of gay old men. Good part was we got Chris to get naked for a second and moon the nudests. Ya, so the beach was good, waves sucked though. Then I got home, bought Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers which I'm now watching. Good BYE.
