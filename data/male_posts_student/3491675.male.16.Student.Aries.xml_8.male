I most;y stickd to the salad which with it's little variety had a weird a week leftover taste to it. Anyway the restaurant wasn't all that bad ok it all was bad except for the uhm person(guy)who i passed path's with he was so CUTE and he saw me looking and had like okay he's looking at me whatever. i coud even see him if i turned around since all i had to do was look back and i could see him i kept doing this and my mom was like "what are you looking at" and of course i was Like im looking at the bathrooms since i feel like taking a piss. Again never go to Steak  country buffet if you're in houston It's  obesity central  i wouldn't have gone but against my will i was forced to go Hmph damn.
