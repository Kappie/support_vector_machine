I was reding the news -  i read only the part of People .. famous people and the international news  - today and i read a readline that made me think!   That was about the american  army, navy and the air force , if they want to, they have free plastic surgery, and their family does too. The thing is : the doctors are the ones who    just    graduated. How bad  /  good?!!!!!!! OK.. they can have it for free but the doctors are still practicing, of course they graduaded. In the news they said " It will be good for both parts: the army looks better and the doctors "PRACTICE""....    Poor  navy/army/ air force , they go to another country, fight, give they life and if they hurt and want to have a scar removed the doctor will be practicing,   on the patient...
