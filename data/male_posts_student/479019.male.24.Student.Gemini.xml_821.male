The truth is that I have no idea what I'm going to do next year if I don't have funding. I only have one more semester of coursework after this semester, which means that if I don't have funding, I don't know what I'm going to do the following 2 semesters. Will I be here doing TA work? Or will I just do things like area papers back in CA? This complicates things such as signing leases, checking boxes on financial aid applications, and just having a sense of security for where I'll be.  It sucks not knowing where you'll be next year. This is a lot like when I was applying to grad school. Not so much the undergrad... because I knew I was going somewhere... this time around thoughts such as... am I wasting my time? come up. The past year and a half have been so mediocre. I don't feel like I've accomplished much, nor have I really gotten to grow much. Everything just feels extremely liminal.   I won't know anything until the end of March or early April. So... much stress...  **
