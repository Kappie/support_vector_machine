Period 1+2 = I.T - it was really good today, we did a test and i got 2 questions wrong giving me the grand % of 95 go me!!!  Perion 3+4 = Tech - oh my thins has got to be one of the most boring subjects in the whole intire world. I kinda jsut wandered about like a foo.  Break - i ate a doughnut, a packet of crisps and a carton of jusic n talked to claire and sarah and laura.  Period 5+6 = English - We watched the rest of animal farm.  Lunch - i was alone for like the first 20 mins then i sat with Nicola and Sarah and then moved over with everyone else. We had a fun time talking about Gran and Granpa  Period 7+8 = P.E -I didnt do PE today because i was "sick" ( ihope no teachers read this!) i sat in the sun and taked to myself.  Period 9 = History - I drew some pictures on why Beer is Bad or what Lack of beer does to mankind.  Period 10 = R.S - We just wrote down about the 2nd and 3rd commandment.  Today was really boring and times where quite upsetting but parts of lunch where loads of fun!  Dave
