I was feeling terribly crappy, idiotic and stupid when I was answering that thing. I slept at 1.  Well. I didn't exactly have a nice sleep. I keep waking up in between, ya know. The stupid feelings of mine. I quickly went back to sleep lor. I remembered a very weird and scary dream. Okay. Me and Ah Ji was at AMK Ave 5. The hawker centre. It was in the very very early morning. I was introducing Ah Ji to the black chicken and ku meen stalls (they were close to each other) when suddenly, we were pulled into the Underworld. We came out after a while, then we remembered we lost something there and wanted to go back in. We were about to, when a gui chai (ghost police) came and warned us, tell us not to go back or we will end up like him. After he left, 5 ghosts appeared, holding the 5 things we lost! I remembered a businessman and an middleage lady. They said they will return them to us if we save them from hell. We ran and shouted "HELP! GUI CHAI!!!". The ghosts ran away upon hearing the name, but soon found us. It was almost dawn. A yellow ghost appeared. Ji said that it was the gui chai, and if we found out its three elements, he would appear to save us. A gold coin appeared and we found out that two of the elements are "gold" and "metal". The businessman suddenly attacked me, and I was like suddenly holding a sword. We were fighting (I remind mysel fo Auron), then Mother woke me up. Meow moo! I must ask Wendy to check the significance of "ghosts" in dreams. I bet it is nothing good. Meow moo!  Hmmm. I was bathing then this Shop N Save cat called. Ayiah. It was Lao Ma Zi wanting my mother to buy coffee for her. Meow! HMmm. I ate roti prata for breakfast. Anyway, I finally managed to download Bo Si Mao's MTV!! YAY! Even ducks meowed at the MTV!!! Meow meow meow!   Hmmm. In the afternoon, I meowed at the mian. Okay. WQ came online, so did a whole bunch of cats including CQ. We were planning to go out, but in the end, due to severe lack of participation and enthusiam, we didn't. Hmm. We (me, WQ, KS and KK) played GunBound. Hmm. We keep switching partners, so each of us played with the each other once. I stopped playing at 4..got sian le. I meowed online...meow meow meow, then went off to bath.  After that,I played FFX, much to the chagrin of my father, who shouted at 7.30 that I shouldn't play FFX and should eat. Hmp. I don't appreciate being shouted at. Meow!!! After that, I went online, watched the sitcoms and meowed online again.  Frankly, for the whole of today, I was feeling quite lousy. Very very lousy. Butterflies keep fluttering in my stomach for some unknown reason. I hardly cheered up at all (oh..I did smile when I win at GB). Sigh. If I go on like this, I will most likely get depressed. ....  Sigh. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
