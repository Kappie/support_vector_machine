The problem I have with my family is their constant assumption that I care, call me selfish but there is now only 1 person I truly care about, myself. People say they love their family but rarely is this true the people who say so only do out of mutual respect of sharing a similar genetic code with their family or for their parents bringing them into this world.  Well I thank my parents for bringing me into this world and respect the pain they went through for me to experience life but I find no reason to say stupid things like 'I love you' to them because of this. I also find sharing genes with my family as nothing special so still I harbour nothing other than mild respect towards my family. Yet they continue to think that my feelings go beyond this and thatat some point I might actually say 'I love you' to one of them, I do not look at any member of my family and feel any signs of the greatest of emotions, I do not have incestual feelings and therefore I shall never say 'I love you' to any member of my family.  An example of this cruel assumption that my family has placed on my head is my mother, unfortunately she suffers from some kind ofmild insanity (I believe it's cause is alcohol but I don't know the details of it all), it was because of this 'insanity' that my mother was taken away from where she lived and placed into the care of a hospital, upon my father's discovery of this he continued to tell me all about where she was and why etc and then ask me if I was alright. OFCOURSE I'M NOT ALRIGHT FOOL, I WAS ENJOYINGA VIDEO GAME AND YOU COME IN AND MAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM MINE!!! I would have said that but unfortunately that makes me sound inhuman because of all the years of families caring for eachother brainwashing my father into thinking that I would be the same and give a fucking damn, so therefore I have to feel uneasy as I act like I care, ask stupid questions like 'why'd they take her?' and then carry on to say that I'm alright.  Don't get me wrong, my family are alright sometimes, my sisters are always funny and my parents are so odd that they're quite funny too (an insane person and a hippy, what's not funny about that?), but I just wish that some daythey'll realise I really wouldn't care if they died, they don't do my life any good in the first place, I could live by myself now (as much as they protest that I can't) and the most they do for me is make me laugh every now and then. I can't have a good conversation with them either because I've already surpassed their intellect, Iremember asking my father many questions when I was young but rarely were they anything more complicated than 'how does a combustion engine work?' or something along those lines and I would usually get an answer that satisfied my curiosity, but now as my knowledge has grown I ask more complex questions like 'how does an object produce photons?' or 'what's string theory?' and I no longer get any answers that explain anything. I enjoy talking about and sharing knowledge with others but my family has no knowledge that interests me that I don't already know.  In short, my family are no use to me any more other than a laugh now and again and I hope one day they'll realise I don'tthink about themany more about them than the grass I walk over every month to visit Alyssa's grave.
