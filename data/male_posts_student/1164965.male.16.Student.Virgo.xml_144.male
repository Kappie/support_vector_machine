The crowd was quiet and respectful in both the commons and the parking lot and there weren't too many jokes cracked later on that day. Either something of the message got through to the general mob or i have greatly underestimated their intelligence. ...well, probably the former of those two options.   I also wanted to thank Mrs VA for the discussion we had in third period. First perioders truely missed out.   hmmm, that was oddly written. Oh well. --beck
