Later on, i was in the st patty's day pareade in peekskill (across the river) and i drove kevin mcbride. it was nothing special, except hes the IRISH BOXING HEAVY WEGHT CHAMPION. he was mad cool, and supposedly he will be fighting mike tyson in his next match. i hope he wins cause he is that MONEY. i then proceeded to go to McGourty's house and i drank quite alot, but i felt sick so i stopped. they had a beer png tourny working, but it was really gay. the table didnt even go up to my knees, and the team that was winning leaned SO MUCH: i mean their chest was over the table. i couldnt complain though, cause the guy was a second leutenant in the marine corps, and he would have killed me six times before i hit the floor. i wish i stayed home though, i got alot of calls from alot of people and i wish i was with them than with people i dont know. today was the swim brunch. it was probably the best one yet, even better than the first one i went to. it was really sad because today was the official end of the alliance era (me bryan doug- connor graduated last year)but i am glad its over. later on ill post about stepping stones and life and all that good stuff, i need to get that off my chest. maybe everyone should do it especially after bobs inspiring speech (which i read from beginning to end, and i completely agree) until i spill my guts in the next post farewell Darin ps. Kevin mcbride is awsome, when we drove (at the parade) by irish people, he would say "erin go braugh, ireland forever!" when we drove past spanish people, whe would say "hasta luego!", and whne we would drive by black poeple he would go "yo yo yo gangstah!" and he would scream it loud. usually i would be afraid, but i was with him, i was really hoping there would be a fight...
