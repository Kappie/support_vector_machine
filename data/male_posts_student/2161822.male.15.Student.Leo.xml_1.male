I guess the days of going outside and enjoying yourself are over. Well, they've been over for a long time now but whatever. Well, only 2 more days with our Algebra teacher. I've always grown up thinking teachers were evil and crazy especially math teachers, but now I realize how true it was. Except our teacher skipped out on being evil and made up for it by being ridiculously crazy. I'll miss some of the good times in her class. "GO BRUCE!" If only we had a Bruce in our class.  "What's y-a-y?" I've never seen a worse speller in my life. I've never seen someone use the word "rigamaroo" so much. And she has proven that white people cannot dance. But hey, I think everyone will miss her crazy antics and the great times in her class. Except for maybe Jeeeimy MONtone. He never seems to have a good time in that class. Always sittin there with his hand over his face sniffin stuff. This kid hasta learn to lighten up. This kid likes his COCAINAAAAAAAAA. People with working minds please ignore the last 5 sentences.
