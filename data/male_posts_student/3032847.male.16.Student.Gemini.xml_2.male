They've gone alright- each one better than I was expecting the night before, and I think I've done quite well! Although- come to think of it, if I'd have done a bit more revision- and drove myself into serious depression and wacky mental health problems, I may have done a bit better. But it's not worth it!   My last exam ever (statistics) went OK. Considering I missed many lessons, I managed to answer nearly all of the paper. Apart from the bit that mentioned standard deviation of something or other, and working out the mean from the standard deviation or- WHATEVER! It's done and dusted and I can shut up about it! Needless to say- the weather was just as Mr Malcolm (schools exam officer) forecasted over a month ago, when he told us to imagine 'in a months time, when you walk out the exam hall and you've done all your exams- there's a clear blue sky- a few white fluffy clouds..' etc. (or something along them lines)! I rode to me grandads after that, and managed to shread my trousers to bits due to abscence of chain guard- and feeling of utter carelessness. But who cares, I'll never need to wear that uniform- EVER AGAIN. Brilliant!  So I've completely done and dusted with school education. What else has happened today that's been life changingly excellent? Our new telly came! A 32" widescreen- panasonic, with a panasonic DVD recorder. Oh yeahh. I've given it a good wearin in tonight, while me mam 'nd dad where down the pub. Lovely jubbly big flat screen, and we have all our sky channels back on since I rang the number on the card, after everything cocked up ages ago and our old sky digital box shorted out the phone lines and lost half our channels... did you know when you ring sky they're all indians on the phone :-0! I was in such a good mood today, I even enjoyed putting up the flat-packed integrated TV stand thing. This was a day to remember!
