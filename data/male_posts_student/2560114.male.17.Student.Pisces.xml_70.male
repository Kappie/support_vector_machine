We played some Texas Hold'em Poker, yeah...wasnt pretty fo me, haha, i lost all of my money. Yeah then when we usually about to hit the sack, we all talk about "guy" stuff, like girlz(fo us to know and u to find out), then we talked about vball. I basically gave matt and jeff like advice on all of there problemz and stuff that they b havin, cuz im a bro like that ya know, i like to help other ppl out when in need. Then we jus talked about the season, and we all agreed that season will b the greatest season ever, but the thing that we r like lackin right now, is the team aspect of it. Not everyone is on the same page on the team, some ppl have beef wit other ppl, so hopefully things will get brighter and everyone will coexist with each other. Then we talked about the next season fo the girlz...eeeeeeeee...not that good. Basically cuz its gonna b a new core group of girlz and the lack of experience and the will power of most of these girlz arent there, the only girlz i consider like wanting to win and kick ass is right now, wren and mikaela. Cuz those 2 in practice like bust there ass for everything and i like that in ppl, motivation to do whatever it takes to win. Speakin of wren, she freakin like called me at 11:00 at night, but its all good though except fo the fact matt and jeff were like sayin shit and makin me laugh. Yeah, and i shall make branlin that cd, all i need is the playlist though. Then finally we jus talked about pointless drills and vball like, montana to rice, the most pointless drill ever created, we dont run under the net, we dont catch the ball, we dont throw the ball, so what the hell ppl...COME ON!!!! yeah that was basically it. So i might post stuff lata, so...later dayz.  This Weekz Grade: A-  Insight: This week has been one of the best weekz ive had in a long time, im usually plagued with shit that gets me down and other stuff, but this week was pretty awesome.  Keyword: Patience....
