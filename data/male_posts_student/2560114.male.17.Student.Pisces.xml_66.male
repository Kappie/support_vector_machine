She doesnt want to tell me anything, but thats ok i guess cuz its her decision. Im jus worried about her, cuz last time she was like this, we were both grieving and it wasnt pretty. ppl keep sayin that somethin good was suppose to happen to me, but right now im jus clueless, cuz nothin good has happened to me in a while...i jus dont know anymore...im always a step behind...and i always get burned about it. bye.
