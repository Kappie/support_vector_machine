With me today is stud1413, a student full of dreams an aspirations to cha~   1413: Uh, not really.   Admin: Oh. Well, we have a resourceful, youn~   1413: *shakes head*   Admin: Um.  We have stud1413!  Tell the readers a little about yourself 1413.   1413: Well, I don't really know where to start.   Admin:  Your age, what you do, where you exist.   1413: I'm a student, hence my prefix and I am currently in my Eleventh Year.  Hopefully I can leave the educational facility that I am currently at to work as my father did, and his father before him (like most other fathers out there) in the unimaginative and resourceful workplace of the factories.  I hope to have no more than the 2 alloted children with whatever wife government gives me, hopefully I will be one of the lucky ones with a choice.  Maybe someday I'll move to Mars and work as a resource collector in the mines.   Admin: A very noble dream.  How, may I ask, is life treating you now?   1413: A pleasent life is always given by government and never anything less.  I enjoy my two square meals a day of  Soylent Green  and attend regular day school on my desk for the rest of my waking hours.  The teacher is very nice, I could not tell it was an artificial intelligence until you told me. And my classmates are very smart, much smarter than I am.  And much better students too.  At least, that's what my teacher  says .   Admin: And what do you do in your spare time 1413?   1413: Oh, the regulated excercises of course.  The automated treadmill, the holographic lifting appliance, and the electrical muscle motivator that stimulates my muscles with its electrical impulses.   Admin: Is that it?  Any secrets that you could share?  And hidden desires?   1413: Secrets...? Of course not!  I would enver keep a secret from government! Ever!   Admin: Oh of course not, and I would not ever assume as such.  What I meant was, any hidden desires (legal of course)?   1413: Oh... Maybe... Someday... I might get to see my birth parents, or even meet a classmate.  Just some form of communication with someone other than those Mr. Caretaker assigns... Not that they're bad or anything!! I really like Mr. Caretaker!! He is Very Nice!!   Admin: Well, thank you very much 1413 for the interview.  Maybe you can see it in the next issue of Always Dilligant, Machine Inscribed News. Always serving government with loyal devotion. These messages may be censored or changed without notice by goverment for he is all knowing and worthy of our devotion. :) Good-bye.   .The.End.   1413: ...but I'm not allowed to read that Newpaper...   -ArV
