"Mistakes are the portals of discovery." --James Joyce   Yes, the discovery of how much of a dumbass you are.   "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars." --Les Brown   The moon is closer to us than the stars, shit head.   "When one door of happiness closes, another opens: but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us." --Helen Keller   Helen Keller didn't write that shit. She's a fucking urban legend.   "In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on." -- Robert Frost   It doesn't have to.  I hate these things. I also hate people who read them to try to convince themselves that they aren't fucked, when they most certainly are fucked (see especially: the original inspirational text: the Bible). I guess I'll try my hand at a few quotes myself:  "There is no hope. Kill yourself." "You are only getting older." "Nobody actually likes you." "You orgasm too quickly." "You're going to die."  Ahhhh, angst.
