First off here is to all you people who say, "musicians got money, I can just take it from them cause they are rich."  This is true for bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, and i recommend stealing all of their music so you can put them out of business.  But this is not true for the good stuff that isn't on MTV.  What?  There are bands out there that aren't on MTV??  I mean bands like nofx and the riverdales....they don't have money!  The only 2 reasons to download music from bands such as these are:  1. That you want to get a sample of their music, but once you download, and like the band, then you  go out and buy  the cd. 2. You are downloading punk covers (like I do) because those songs were just made for fun, and the bands aren't making any profit off of those.  And I laugh when people download music from there favorite bands because they are  killing their idols careers!   See here is the record industry in a nutshell....  1. Record company gives the band money to make a cd 2. Band uses that money to make their cd 3. Band gets money to pay back record industry through cd sales and if the band doesn't have money to pay back the record company says, "screw you, we are through with you." and they drop them like yesterdays news.  So, if you steal songs off the internet the only thing you are doing is taking money from the band and which in turn sends your own band into a slow downfall, and then eventually dying off completely.  So, if you hate a band steal the songs and hope they go out of business.  But if you love a band then you should buy the cds, so the band can prosper and love you back too.
