I broke my personal best by riding 36 miles from home down to the Whitten's and making a big loop back. Smarty Jones was the one with a bad ride. He lost by a length to Birdstone in the Belmont Stakes. That makes 6 horses now in the last 8 years to win races 1 (Kentucky Derby) and 2 (Preakness) but not win the Belmont and the prestigous Triple Crown. I really want to see a horse win the Triple Crown - you should have seen how nervous I was before the race started. Ughhhhhh! Last time a horse has won the triple crown was in 1977!
