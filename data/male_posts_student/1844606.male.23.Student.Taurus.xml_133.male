Then I learned the difference betweeen licit and illicit drugs (thanks for the clarification). Next I learned how to score bowling and promptly through up a 75 (with one strike).  The dude does not ablige.  Must read up in "Right up your alley" text.    Got an email back from the girl that was in my rhet class. We might try and get together for lunch, though its purely innocent cause she's got a bf (but of course).  Currently upping my collection of Slayer.  And then sleep.
