I – a fish lives with no water, Had lost a special friend.  Seconds pass by slowly, A day seems like a year. I can’t lose that special friend. Like a car without a gear.  You insisted that its not my fault. You said you’ve too much thought. You said I’ve done too much for you. And it is time to stop.  You wanted a life way before me. You wanted a love a rich couldn’t give. You claimed that one day I’ll leave. And not even heaven we will meet.  You, my narrator of life, Has decided to quit. You said it’s the end of this chapter, And a new storyteller will read.  I’ll open the door of freedom, That had locked you for centuries. Now, go as far as possible. Never look back – promise me.  Will this be a to-be-continue? No one can foresee. But one thing I’m sure You’ll be happier without me.  Goodbye my friend that’s all I can give It’s more blessed to give, then to receive!    -yit hann  It’s really amazing on how everything could be summed up in one poem. Everything is indeed true. .. yes.. true !   love, yit hann.
