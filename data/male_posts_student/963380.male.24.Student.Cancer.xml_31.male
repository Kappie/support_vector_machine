One thing is making work bearable right now, that's four hours of Star Trek back to back. Which is great even if one of the eps has to be from voyager. It's kind of like reading an author you hate, you don't enjoy it, but it's valuable from a literary criticism standpoint. Bought a CD Rack for my cd's so I can finally get rid of my stupid tilt a whirl rotate a cd holder. I may put that downstairs when I eventually get a stereo (I might buy a stereo!!)  I'm thinking of turning the corner of my bedroom into a little board game centre. Four chairs or stools that would fit under a table just the right size for some board games and drinks. I think I might build the table myself and put a chess/checkers board right into the surface. I'm going to look around and see how it's done.  That is all.
