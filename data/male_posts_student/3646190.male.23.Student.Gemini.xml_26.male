I was supposed to do it on Hindutva but fate, life, God, my past (call it what you will) compelled me to start writing on this. I have found that in a matter of days I have been able to put this together compared to what it took months of research to put a few pages of the Hindutva pamphlet.  Of course I am still going to do some research on patriarchy, but the meat of the pamphlet will hopefully be an organic piece that young Desis can relate to one level or another. Obviously it has a lot problems—grammar, sentence structure, some of the thoughts end abruptly, some of the paragraphs are out of order the politics might even by unclear, but I will fix it. For example, the context of Islam there is are a lot of good/radical views that can help women and young men understand how badly patriarchy sucks, and in effect be used to fight patriarchal practices ( I think I will use Islamic texts in the pamphlet to fight patriarchy), I just want this in my journal….  Another part of me wants to email my old love and ask for her help. She is the only person on the plant that can complete this piece. I know how class, family, tradition, patriarchy, the war affected me and our relationship, but I cannot be sure how these things affected her and only she can provide that insight….   I will not post for a couple days cuz this post is gonna be lengthy…  I am reminded of what Frantz Fanon said ( I will paraphrase it) Each new generation has to decide if it will betray the struggles of the past generation…or continue the struggle..  -----  I was in love for three years with a Desi woman that I believed I would spend the rest of my life with. In those years I experienced struggle, love, joy, and sadness and it is those years which have helped me develop an understanding of what it is like to be a woman in the Desi-Muslim community. In understanding our love and the reasons we went our separate ways I have come to conclusions that shape my views on the problems of the community. Not only are my views theoretical on some level, but they are also grounded on the practical day to day struggles her and I had to endure under her parent’s watchful eyes and the community’s hypocritical moralisms. I do not regret what transpired between her and I, for the knowledge and wisdom that journey parted on my, I hope to part to others in an attempt to create a world where women and men in our community will never have to endure the trials we were put through. It is the most personal and meaningful political discoveries that have come upon me thanks to life’s taughtful methods of pain and joy. In the following pages, are the conclusions that I have reached after thinking for months about what divided our love.  I cannot speak from a women’s perspective nor write this pamphlet from that perspective. I can speak of the experiences I have had and the conclusions I have reached watching women being treated like steak, ground beef, or pork to be sold to the highest bidder in the Desi community. Not only have I seen women treated in such a manner, I have had my own partner treated in such a way by her parents. Not only did it affect her, psychologically, but it also affected our relationship and myself. I will leave it for other women to speak about how patriarchal behavior affects women. I will discuss how patriarchal behavior affected our relationship and myself.  All of us have felt the knot in our stomach whether male or female when our parents measure as not a total human being: the compilation of our success, failures, our tears and joys, and our dreams and nightmares. We have all felt the our dreams trapped in our parent’s ambitions for us to become doctors or engineers. And some of us have let our parent’s trap define the outlines of our life. Others how ever have broken that box and have been left alone to pick up the shattered pieces and make sense to what was our families. This essay will attempt to give direction to those shattered pieces and reassemble them in a way that projects a world were all of us can live our own dreams with the acceptance of our parents. By no means is the path this world easy, but I would argue that not only do we owe it to our selves, the shattered pieces, but to the unborn children in the Desi community so they will not have to ponder who to break out of their parent’s dreams oneday as well.  Going to a Desi wedding is an interesting experience. It is similar to going to a friend’s stock broker or financial manager. If you probe deep enough into the marriage you will often find that love was not the reason the two were married, but a financial accommodation. TO be more precise, the man was a doctor and the girl was light-skinnned, not touched, and beautiful. Sometimes it can work the other way too, where the girl is in a more powerful economic position but that does not happened too often. What is usually the case when the girl is a doctor is that she is married to someone else who is a doctor.  I don’t have any disagreements with doctors marrying doctors or engineers etc etc, but what I do rebel against is the fact that many of these kids circumvented their ambitions just to make their parents happy and this is one of the places where I have my differences. Our dreams belong to us and not our parents to toy and tinker with. It is their fault that they cannot accept our desires and whims. The obvious argument is of course that our parents know what is best for us. I could not disagree more. I have listened to these parents and seen what they base good character and values on. The look to see if the man or woman is a doctor and if the family comes from an economically stable background. They base their judgment from formal family functions and events where everyone that comes is putting on a show, for what else is a wedding, or birthday party in the Indian community than a place for our parents to look for possible mates for us in the future.   It is when we feel this sting, when our parents tell it is better to become a doctor that we have to make that decision of living upto our dreams or abandoning them. It is a defining point in our lives because I belive it represents our character and projects it in our future actions. Will we forever conform to what is wrong in life or will we have the continued courage to stand up for what is right and to make that fight no matter what the cost.  The socio-human relations that are created when parents impose their dreams or ambitions between us and parent becomes perverted and affects both in different and similar manners. My partner’s parents could not see her other than a cum dumpster for a rich man to deposit his seeds of germination. They could only see her as a way of continuing the family line. They could only see her as an object to be married off to the highest bidder and the knew these bidders over formal get together and visits. They could never know what these young men thought when they were not around or how they behaved in the presence of peers. They only knew the show that young Desis put on in front of their relatives—the great circuis that has become our lives because we have not dared to be forthcoming that we are no longer the product of our parents and India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh, but the products of something far more complex. Not only are we created by the new cultural forces that our parents cannot grasp such as hip-hop, mass media, Bollywood, academia, but also forces from the past that have been purposely forgotten.  The identity of the Desi-Muslim is constructed in such a manner that we are led to believe that we can only be doctors or engineer and everything else falls short of what a true Desi should be. The reality is however that we are more than either of those two occupations. The proof is in the working class communities that are in Chicago, New York, and Hamtramck. These communities defy the stereotypical Desi identity.   Marriage  I have been to countless….  Conclusion In reading day to day struggles of S. Asian women, I noticed that many of them ended in defeat and in those readings I reflected on my own struggles against this form of oppression and came the conclusion that in the simplest of analysis, my own separation with my old love was a defeat by more powerful forces such as patriarchy, tradition, and _________.   One of the biggest problems I noticed in the struggles of the women and of men is that even after success, we rarely consolidate them and reflect on them, and more importantly rarely do the manifest themselves into an organizational form that challenges what oppressed us directly. We let our struggle remain buried in the personal and not let it transform it into a broader political and organizational struggle.  When I was reading “Alone and Exploited,” I realized that the varying expressions that resistance and self-management can take and yet it is overlooked by women. In this story a young women…. But it is her ability to manage her own affairs, especially financially that break the other contradictions such as her psyhocological shackles to her husband and fears of breaking tradition that set her free. Although it is not clear what this woman will do at the end of the story, it is obvious that in her struggle to have a better life for her husband and her life….  I have also learned about relationships that they at no point are they perfect and to expect a man or woman to behave in that manner is unfair. What can be expected is that each be vigilant in demanding the most egalitarian relationship possible. There were times where I know I was patriarchal toward her, but if there is one political residue that I know I left with her was to constantly challenge anything I said and it is that which she did. And if some of her final words before we broke up are true then it was my overbearing and political aggressiveneness that led to the breakup as well.   It is true that coming to this country have altered the form patriarchy takes place. Generally women are not told to stop their education after high school. Some of the old forms of oppression are blunted because of the economic realities of this country. Some of the old forms of oppression persist and create painful experiences that are either leave the woman with a sense of empowerment or continued defeat.   For example, my partner was never told not to go to college, but she always had on her mind what kind of career  Although I am left to do this pamplet alone now and not without my partner, I believe it is critical that I analyze the past and reflect and politicize the most personal, joyous, and painful experiences of my life because I believe that many other young Desis are living exactly what her and I vhea lived. Although we could not overcome the forces against us, both of us walked away as fuller and deeper human beings able to hold more joy and sadness because of the experiences our love had carved into us.   “Our Feet Walk the Sky”  Some of the stories I have read remind me how brave my partner was and will hopefully continue to be. I have read some stories were young Desi woman told their heart desires to leave their life because of the disappointment their parents would have int heir selection of a life partner. Some have told me that my partner was weak for not fully standing up to her parents for me. But I have realize that she fought that in her own ways and I know how it tore her life into shred in making those fights. I wanted her to completely abandon her parents and walk away from her family because they could not accepot her heart’s choice. She could not make that decision and I belive that it was the right path. She had to make such a fight in her family.   Family We cannot abandon our family and the extended community that exists. It is our space and our right to assert ideas that are different from tradition that we do not agree with. Without a doubt it is a painful experience for it brings up things we do not want to talk about. The way our fathers treat our mothers, the way our brothers get away with more than our sisters—the list is long…  Perhaps the greatest legacy of tradition and patriarchy is the chastity of women and there one aspect which manifested itself during and after my love and I broke up which I would like to talk about.   …. After we broke up, she was forced to remind me that I should never mention what happened between her and I to anyone. I had to give back everything of ours, photos, clothes, and even the memories that I loved. It is a strange sense of violation to have one’s memory purposely erased for the sake of convenience. Of course to some extent it is for her convenience, but the root of the problem is not her but so much as the mentality in the Desi community that girls should be pure and not touched. If my love’s identity was ever discovered and all our intimate nights revealed, then she should surely die a widow. I feel this is a crime not only to her, but to my own sense of who I am….  Did she think about and reflect on our relationship after we broke up, or was her first task to erase all files titled “Shemon?” I do not know. I know I spent months reflecting on our relationship and trying to make sense of it and I continue to do so today recognizing that in one sense it was one of the most important political fights in my life. Although at the time I never recognized it as such, but I know we were always up against a variety of forces. It just happened that our relationship found its troubled days when the war on Iraq was impending and my own gaze was not on my heart, but on the impending destruction of a whole nation. And that it has changed me in ways more than the anti-war movement, antir-racist struggles, or the Palestine solidarity movement ever did. Will she ever share our love with her future husband? With her children? In what ways is she denying her own human existence and experiences? In what ways is she limiting her own self-development spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually? I cannot know the answers to these questions because I am not her and I also have taken a completely different route so to even speculate would be conjecture. Will I be erased completely from existence?
