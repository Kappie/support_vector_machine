I don't care about my birthday coming, I care about this concert. Covering 30 years of their greatest hits...wondering if they play in chronilogical order. I hope not I want them to mix it up that way it's random and more exciting. I'm just praying that Geddy, Alex or Neil don't have a seizure or something, they're old people. I'm praying to god also that I live to see this concert. That's all I want. Please god, make this dream come true. Reality...at Jones Beach. Oh yea and Paul Stoltz' birthday party was fun, I stripped naked and ran down my road. The ladies rated my ass #1? Whoda knewn.
