It's like "Wow cool, a house on the boardwalk..," But the boardwalk is so-so, and the beach is over-rated. Instead of boring you with my experience, I'll just give you the facts of why it's not that great  1) Music When going to the beach, you picture in your head (At least I do) surfer music (which is ironic, because it has nothing to do with surfing). You'd think with all the artsy beach bums down here, you could at least find a good record shop. I was hoping to find something righ out of "High Fidelity." No such luck. I mean, you have millions of food joints, suglass huts, and   water ice   stores. Although there is one store. It has like a real broad selection. Too add to my disappointment, all the CD's were at least 15$. If it was a double disc it would be something like 35$.  Now I wanted to purchase A DMB live CD. It didn't matter which one. I had enjoyed the   Live in Central Park  .   So to conclude, the only store that sells CD's, is a little store on the boardwalk of OC. Next time I'll save 5 bucks and buy the CD at best buy. Or better yet, I'll burn the CD.    2) My friends In years past vacation has been fun with the family. Well, in years past I was like 10 years old. Girls still kind of had cooties, and your parents weren't that bad to hang out with.  This year I wanted to invite my friends on vacation. At first I went to Adam. Adam is a cool kid, the kind of person you always want to hang out with, and can be relaxed and joke around...you don't have to watch what you say. I asked adam through AIM, but (you think this excuse is lame, wait till you hear peters or vinnies) BUT his sister has a fucking dance recital. His sister is what? Like 12? Tell me you'd rather watch her dance around for 2 minutes, than come on vacation. Whatever, I just don't like it when people beat around the bush. It's fine, I'll just move onto someone else.  Now before I jump to the next person, I'll tell you my reasoning for inviting the people I did (or tried). Matt-going to a clarks concert..thats cool, I would have liked to go too. It's a legitamate excuse...He already had the tickets Ryan-is going to camp with me. Camp is in a whole week. The last thing he or I would want to do is spend another week with each other. Enough said.  Now.....peter...peter,peter,peter. Peter's always been my friend. Well, since middle school anyways. Our whole friendship revolves around us arguing. Now peter. Peter has never had a girlfriend. When I say that, I mean that he never even got the label, never got kissed by someone of the opposite sex. We are notified of this constantly by this. So put yourself in my position, and think about it. He's the logical choice. Invite him, he might get some action, and he'll stop complaining I have asked my dear friend peter to come to camp with me for the past 2 years. He's always had some shitty  excuse like he had a class to take. Something like CCAC (community college of Allegheny County), it was like a computer class. It's undertandable, but he sent his money in both times and never went. Needless to say, he never went to his   class   anyways.  So Peter, how would you like to go? I try not to let myself think that he might go, because it will be the same old excuse he always uses about a computer class. After a week of bullshitting me, he replies that he has another computer class.   This is yet another example of how gay my friends can be sometimes   My final,final last resort is Vince. Vince is an only child. I don't know how weird it would be to go on vacation with vince, but it was worth a shot.  To clue you in Vince's family is a little weird. They live in West Virginia, which is a little compensation for why they are like they are. Everytime his grandma gets a paper cut on his finger, Vince has to make the pilgramage to West Virginia to see her. Anways, this has nothing to do with what I was getting at.  Vince also has what he calls an "uncle." I have a few Uncles of my own, but not quite like his. In fact, he's not vinces uncle. He's some burnout band member who is friends with Vinces dad. Why does vince call him his uncle? I haven't the slightest idea. He supposedly has some band that is   REALLY REALLY GOOD  . According to vince they could have been huge. But they weren't. I guess they are still together, and vince was going to see their concert. He can be such a dush bag sometimes.  I want to keep listing reasons why the vacation can suck, but I'll stop here. So keep in mind what we have learned here.  1.) If you can't bring a friend on vacation, don't go at all 2.) If you're friend claims he has a computer class during your vacation, it is total bullshit, don't believe him 3.) If you want to find music anywhere close to a beach, don't count on finding it anywhere, and if you do-it won't be cheap. Bring you're own music, and burn your CD's 4.) You need a life if you are reading this
