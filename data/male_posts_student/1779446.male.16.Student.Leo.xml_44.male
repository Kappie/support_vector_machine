I have to learn some lines for bloody drama, and all this other crud.  My sister got her first holy communion today. I'm happy about that, I just finished reading the sunday papers, and now I think my net is buggering up. Fark. I DON'T WANT TO LEARN MY LINES! I DON'T WANT TO PRACTICE MY PIANO! I DON'T WANT TO GODDAMN WORK TODAY!   I'll calm down. Maybe I'll do some work later. I'm not being pissy. Well not yet. I'll just go take some deep breaths and start again. If this fucking thing does not post I am going to spew blood. I need some motivation. Or drugs. Or booze. I'm reconnecting again. Please work. Please work.  I havent blogged for a while. It's been a whole blur.   Signing off.  Colin
