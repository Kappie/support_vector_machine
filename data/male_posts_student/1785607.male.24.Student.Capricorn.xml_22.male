It's been two days with nice weather, it feels so "fall" .... love this season, not too cold, windy, with flashes of summer breeze but with the sense of winter around the block... hope it doesn't change.  Today I am alone at home... have some money in my pockets and just a class to attend... what should I do? * Go to class (from 7 to 9 pm); * Go and spent that money, or * Just stay at home doin' nothing but watch TV?  I just don't know, still got a few hours to make my mind though. In other matters, I know is still early to be thinking about winter vacations, but I haven't taken a vacation in like two or more years, this one I want to... so I've been thinking in going to San Francisco and then to Vegas... I'm just crossing my fingers...!!!  Ok, I'll leave is time for me to be watching Golden Girls...!  All this just proves my theory: If I don't have time to be thinking about something but school my life seems kinda the same all days... kinda boring, but SO exhausting...!!!
