Hey, I'm done with Chemistry, and I did suprisingly well on the final test. The true final isn't until Thursday, but that is just busywork.  Me and John went to the Bookstore and the Salvation Army after school today. I got the new Spin (the price was raised from 3.50 to 4 dollars, which sucks), and I got a brand new copy of the Autobiography of Malcolm X for 35 cents. That rocked, because my copy was lost years ago one time when I moved. John kept trying to surreptiously make me listen to "Iron Man," which I would have no part of.   I'm thinking about expanding the Joe Day concert into a full-blown documentary thing, but I won't have enough time to finish it before school ends and Joe is getting antsy for it. Plus, I've already got a documentary-type thing going on this summer. It's kinda a vanity thing where I just tape stuff and take a bunch of pictures. I already started, and I think I'm going to use some of the stuff I taped before the concert on Friday that won't make it onto Joe's concert tape.   John and I took the Goat Halo match one step further today. We went to my mom's to deliver the message that we accepted the challenge, and found no one home. So I wrote down the message, and John had a great idea. I took a knife, walked over to the mail, and stabbed the message to a package with the knife. It looked really funny, and I bet it annoyed the hell out of my mom.   I got the Minor Threat complete discography this weekend, and I like it a lot. I don't know why, but I've been gravitating towards hardcore more lately.   What is up with no one blogging? Come on. I know you have longer attention spans than me.  Saw Chris Derby at the show on Saturday. He kinda grated on me, and even Chris picked up on what his deal is. Every time I see him, I just want to tell him that existentialism is total bullshit, and how you put your name to your religion isn't as important as he makes it out to be.  Tomorrow is the last full day of school.  I'm still doing the year end review thing. I really wish you'd email me yours. I'm hoping to post them all on Friday, and I'll bother you all about it for the next few days. Make them about whatever you want. The people you met, movies you saw, stories you heard, fun you had, books you read, anything. Make them as personal or as boring as you want. I don't think you guys realize that you can type whatever you want in this white space, and it can be as self-serving and mundane as you want. Make them long, and have fun. But please do them. Email them to me at badreligion015@hotmail.com. Thanks. P.S.: Don't tell anyone what yours is going to be about so they are all different.  Speaking of books, I borrowed some good ones from the Hobster. I am reading Guns, Germs and Steel right now, and I think it is very interesting. I am also reading this sci-fi book I picked at random off Dan's shelf and it is so-so. I'll read it though, because every other book I have borrowed from there has been good. I usually read a fiction and a non-fiction book at the same time, and I usually go through the non-fiction faster.   Man, that poem we read in English was awesome. It creeped me out sufficently enough to enjoy trying to understand it.   The Casualties are on Warped Tour this year. Man, I can't even begin to think about how long Chris and Erik will go on about that. You should have heard the "Guard Dogs" jokes they were shouting on Saturday night.  In case you haven't noticed, I like to progress from the mundane to the personal on here.   On Sunday night, I was watching the Simpsons, and it struck me that the Simpsons is really becoming overly partisan. Not just Bush-hating, but dealing with real issues like massive corporate media takeovers. But anyway, there was this part where a teenager walks up to a cliff, yells, "Why did you cancel Futurama?", and jumps off the cliff. I, of course, thought of Hobie, and I laughed so hard I fell off the bed. It was the most perfect moment, because I laughed until it made me happy. For a few seconds, I felt invincible. But it was special to me because it felt like innocent unforced humor, something that you don't encounter normally in the halls of BHS.   My mom just called me. In retrospect, the knife thing was goddamn hilarious. My mom said they took some pictures and stuff to prove that I am nuts like they've always suspected.  Can someone find out how to use italics on this? And put in pictures? I've been trying to figure out how for a while now.  Until later.
