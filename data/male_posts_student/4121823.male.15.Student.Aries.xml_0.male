You smiled and you looked at me The soft of your lips, it captured me The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other And then we sat down together You gave me your number, Said Give me a call I thought I wouldn't call at all Here we are, fell in love Like hand to glove Pure bliss from above Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight We never seem to get it right  I can't fall down on my knees And apologise to you Cos that ain't my style (x2)  I remember the night when we were home alone You were on the sofa, I was on the phone You overheard me call out my best friend's name That's when you went crazy, started going insane Grabbed the phone from my hand, Backed me against the wall Shouting and asking Who was on the call? You wouldn't believe me When I said it's just a friend That's when all the matters began  I can't fall down on my knees And apologise to you Cos that ain't my style (x2)  He's got you begging on your knees, Crying in your sleep Making you believe him But you're stronger Than you'll ever know, girl You control your own world No need to take no more  And yo' I asked you to calm down Asked you who was on the phone put the horn down You had a glass of wine a Versace night gown, a lime green one That I brought you for the trip from the    cruise    you won, I don't approve of those male friends, (no) I told you back then when we first got together, I don't trust those men And you did it again I lost my temper, blinked out and wrecked the house boo That's all I remember, I'm sorry  He's got you begging on your knees, Crying in your sleep Making you believe him But you're stronger Than you'll ever know, girl You control your own world No need to take no more
