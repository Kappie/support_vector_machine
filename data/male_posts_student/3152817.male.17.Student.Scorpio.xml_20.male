I think  urlLink Sean Hannity  puts it perfectly when he calls the Democratic Convention the "Re-invention Convention."  That’s exactly what Kerry constantly does.  He re-invents himself into whatever type of person the polls favor.  Is this the really kind of person you want as President?  A person without his own principles.  A person who says "life begins at conception" yet supports abortion?  A person who votes to go to war with Iraq yet refuses vote to give the troops the body armor and supplies they need to fight?  Thank God we have another option...  Our country has been blessed with a great leader.  A leader, who seeks guidance from God each day.  A leader, who makes a decision and sees it through till the end. A leader, who won’t put our national security in the corrupted hands of the United Nations.  A leader, whose principles don’t change direction with the winds of public opinion.  And a leader, who, with your help, will be re-elected on November 2nd for another 4-years of strong, faithful leadership.
