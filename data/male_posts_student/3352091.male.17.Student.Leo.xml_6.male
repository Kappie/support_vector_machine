All the friends ive made this year and years past, i wont see nearly half of them again. well atleast the chapters not over yet i still have graduation ceremony the 25 of May. Perhaps this sounds like i dont cherish the past 17 years of my life in this little town, but to tell you the truth "this town's too small for a man of my ambition"(Big Fish) I will miss my friends and family, but to start a new part of the book of my life. It's like u just finished the first part and it left you in suspense like what will happen to me or whoever, thats what makes you want to read the second part of the novel. New friends, new surroundings, new classes, new school..... a new love maybe. Possibly, all things come with time but that doesnt mean u have to forget the old, on the contrary the old is what makes the new so invigorating and i hope that i will be able to see that when i arrive at my dorm this fall.
