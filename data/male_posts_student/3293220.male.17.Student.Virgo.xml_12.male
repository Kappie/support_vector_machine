The school was originally founded for 70 'poor and needy scholars', but now educates 700 Wykehamists at any one time, the majority of whom (630) are called "Commoners".  It  urlLink excels  academically, often topping the UK secondary school league tables.    Like all good public schools, Winchester is steeped in history and tradition.  Much has been written about the college's history, including a selection of  sixth centenary essays  collated by Dr. Custance.  Wykehamists like school boys all over the UK have extended and adapted the English language spoken within the institution.  The words used (almost) exclusively within the College are termed " notions "( Hardback ).   Several books have been written compiling the Notions.  However by their very nature, Notions are ephemeral and often specific to only a single generation of Wykehamists.  Indeed many of the notions in use today are very different to those collected by Charles Stevens. More recently as Winchester becomes increasingly less insular and the men in the school communicate more freely (helped by the un-banning of mobile phones) the use of Notions is starting to disappear altogether.  Winchester claims to be the public school with the longest unbroken history of continuous teaching.  Like all institutions Winchester has had its share of problems including its very own revolts (c. 1704 rebellion of Fellows), and, being a famous public school, the media are always keen to expose any flaws.  A headmaster's departure, allegations of price-fixing, teachers' suspensions, and the headmaster being blocked from the HMC are just a few of the items capitalised upon by the press over the last year.   As far as I can tell there isn't a large Wykehamist presence online.  (At least no blogs that I could find.)  A few collect and chat on Everything2 (indeed there is an E2  urlLink group  of them).  Of course none of this adds to your knowledge of what it's _actually_ like to study here.  The answer is, of course, it depends.  It depends on your house in the school, on your personality, your academic ability, and it even depends on how well you can and will gel with your housemaster.  Any advice for future wykehamists?  Yep, do your research.  Research your future house and housemaster carefully.  It is very important for you to get a feel for the place in which you will spend 5 years of your life.  Winchester College isn't for everyone, though the academic education in most instances is  urlLink excellent , not everyone is an academic, and even if you are, the Winchester environment might just not be your cup of tea.  Overall I and many others have found the experience to be worthwhile.
