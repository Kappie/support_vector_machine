The reason this was a profitable decision on the part of the Old Navy executives is:  PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM!  I KNOW!?  that's what I said.  As my mind wandered in my three hour capstone class this past evening, I was drawn to notice the smaller details of my surrounding (this happens after text messaging, making a "to-do list," signing you name 20 times on a blank piece of paper, and counting the ceiling tiles gets old).  My eyes meandered over to the foreign gentleman sitting next to me when he raised his hand to answer a question, and I couldn't help but notice he was wearing painter pants.  Old Navy- you suckered 'em in, you got the foreign kids.  I started to notice that these handy jeans, complete with a strap to carry your hammer, are typically worn by the immigrant or complete douche.  Sometimes by the complete douche immigrant.  "Aren't all immigrants complete douche's Mason?"  You might be asking.  NO, they aren't, and that's very rude of you to say or assume, and for the record YOU said it not me.  Anyway, back to the point, I just don't get it, they aren't needed in our society anymore.  I am sure that somewhere out there, I might offend someone *gasp*- as if that hasn't happened everytime I have opened my mouth in the past 11 years,  but it just has to be addressed.  Painter pants and carpenter jeans, from now on, need to be reserved for painters and carpenters.  Not for the foreign kid who didn't know any better, and the douche's from small towns who only possess taste in their mouth, even though it's not their fault.  This brings me to my next point, maybe they don't know any better, maybe they are just accepting that what's in stores must be okay to wear.  So I now must go back to the executives at Old Navy, "The Suits" if you will.  We went after Big tobacco for marketing cigarettes to people for years, and not telling us they were bad!  I say it's time to go after Big Old Navy.  As if people didn't know that inhaling black smoke into your mouth wasn't gonna kill you.  If we can sue over that, I say we hit up stores who market pure shit-style to innocent consumers who take it as acceptable and then in turn, clutter my surroundings with horrid visuals.  Enough is enough.  On a lighter, yet related note: Fran Drescher, spokesperson for Old Navy, is still the most irritating person on Earth.
