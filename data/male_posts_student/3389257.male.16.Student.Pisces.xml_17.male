I Sit here writing songs, becoming rather sentimental and slapping some funk out on my bass. I have an exam on monday. It will be good. Sarcasm Was intended. I doubt you can see that in the writing.We have found a house. It looks ugly on the outside. much like me thought. It is beautiful on the inside. i sound much like a drunken Re Or Philosophy teacher. I am not. being legally underqaulified and aged, that would be a mistake. Ashley, you are shoutuing at me, so here is my spot to you..goodbye ashley, you shall surely be missed. history with you was enjoyable. I will remember you and your sharp wit with Mr Midgley. Me am going now. Ben
