It talks quite a bit about impermanence and the nature of life.  From #58 "Happiness is rooted in misery.  Misery lurks beneath happiness.  Who knows what the future holds?  There is no honesty.  Honesty becomes dishonest."  Alot ot Taoism is all about accepting the false idea of the duality of nature.  We say good and evil, but what is each?  How do you define these?  Unlike nature, which just accepts the these actions, humans feel the need to describe them.  I dunno.  There is way too much to get into on this one, and I dont feel like I am qualified to go any further, as I am just touching the tip of this philosophy.    Anyways, off to the zoo for another fun day of animals and the little creatures that we have on display...
