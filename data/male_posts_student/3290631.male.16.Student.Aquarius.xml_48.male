Hindus worship several gods, which represent different forms of the most divine spirit of the Hindu religion,  Brahman .  Hinduism, like Buddhism, stresses that people reach true enlightenment only by detachment from earthly desires.  Gurus, or spritual teachers play a major role in spreading Hindu beliefs--they interpret and provide insight into the religion.

Vishnu is the preserver of the universe, whereas Shiva is its destroyer.  They say that the best way to learn something is to teach it, so here I am I guess.
