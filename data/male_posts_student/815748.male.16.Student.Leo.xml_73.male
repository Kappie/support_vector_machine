The song playing right now is "Changes," by Tupac Shakur, by the way.  I'll "change" it when the site from whence it came comes back up.  I think I'll postpone my plan until next Thursday.  It's just not ready yet.  I got my camcorder.  It's pretty cool, but there are still a few kinks to work out.  That's about it.  There's little happening these days.  Adios, muchachos.
