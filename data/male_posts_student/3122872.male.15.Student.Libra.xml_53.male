First, you may be wondering: [side note:  you , like, someone else apart from me is readings this?]    what is the purpose of this blog?  The simple answer to that is to act as a jotpad for ideas and thoughts for the staff and friends of  Black Ghost Studios .   Erm, Black Ghost Studios?  Yeh, Black Ghost Studios is a Studio dedicated in indie development, by indie developers. It started as a hobby for me, and it still is. I have to wait and see how far the rest of my friends are willing to stay with  Black Ghost Studios .   Yeh whatever, you're just a bunch of losers!  Thanks, just read the meaning of Ghostanomics :)  James won't be the most happy man in the world when he sees this, but I promise to him this is just occasional postings, I will still post in  urlLink Life eh?  Meanwhile, to find out a little more, why not check out my  urlLink website ? View the forums, and you should see a new template for it. Should be cool B), see you there.    Tribute to thy l33tn3$$,    Jamie  ,  urlLink Black Ghost Admin
