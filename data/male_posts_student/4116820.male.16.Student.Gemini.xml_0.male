Shes down in North Carolina and I'm kinda wondering how she weathered that hurricane hope shes ok. I lost the Beans vs. P war. 1000 paintballs like 3 hits. I think I'll help everyone pass there day by giving them good sites to read. www.maddox.xmission.com and chester.secretpeaks.com. Oh yeah,  MONK  may be the dumbesty show I've ever seen. Actually I feel like taking a break from being so pissed. So one show that rocks is Disneys  Filmore . Also  I Love the 70s 80s and 90s  well I think I'm going to go to bed.
