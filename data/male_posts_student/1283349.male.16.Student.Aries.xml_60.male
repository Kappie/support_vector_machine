Devout little Rasca put in his application for Senior Missionary of the Clerics last night, and I'll probably get it. It'll be good to get back into a guild leadership position, the last non-GM one I held was like 10 in-game years ago. Well, more like 5 in-game years ago, but I miss it. The power, the women, the fast cars...  I'm working on a new blog for my numerous D campaigns. I've been thinking about how it should work, and I've come down to this: an introductory post, very seductive and sexy with geek details, for each campaign; individual posts giving character bios; posts after game sessions recounting the events; posts of game history, extra XP opportunity assignments, and so on. The important ones I can put in a sidebar, permalinking to the posts. That should do it.  I've also been working on getting someone to read this damned thing. Brian, I appreciate the zealous audience of one, but all this HTML needs some company.  Time for escuela, which I believe ends quite shortly, not next thursday, but the thursday after. That thursday also marks the first session of the renewed Underdark campaign, so look for details at hacktastic.blogspot.com
