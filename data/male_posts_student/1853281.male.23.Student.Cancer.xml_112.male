Then back to campus where i sat in the coffee shop and did not study for several hours before finally studying for a few. Now i have my next final at 6:30 and then my last one on friday Hard to believe the semester is over, got all nostalgic last night with D. when we were studying. Am in a really great mood, keep smiling for no reason.
