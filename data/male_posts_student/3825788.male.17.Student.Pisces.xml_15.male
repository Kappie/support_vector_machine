I do it, alot, and I find that it sometimes makes me so mad that I could run through Kennewick down to Lucas' house just to complain to him how torqued I am.  You'll find more grief than satisfaction if you try to look to deep into things.  Sometimes, when the girl you like hugs you, you might think to yourself, "Was that a 'later, pal' hug; Or was it a 'Bye, hun' hug?"        DON'T.       You'll obsess over it and wind up miserable, because no matter how certain you think you are, you will always have doubt.  So, don't worry about it.  Take it as a hug, and nothing more.     Oh, and don't try to understand an ambiguous comment made by a female.  You'll never understand what they mean, and end up in a state of mental wreck, praying God will smite you so you can ask him what she meant by, "You are really cool."   Trust me, you'll never understand women.  Don't try.    That's all for our first installment.    -Dake
