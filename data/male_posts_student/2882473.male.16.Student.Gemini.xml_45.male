Just one more day... 4 hours of lessons, followed by what will no doubt be an exceptionally boring assembly, where the head-teacher will rant on about how we should be revising hard, befriending dictionaries and looking after our brooms. Yes, he is that weird.  My last ever business lesson was good. Other than going through past papers, we were each given 2 chocolates each, which was very kind of our teacher. Geography was as crap as usual, teacher being his moody self. There were probably a record number of 'for f***s sake...' phrases from the English teacher, but we couldn't add them to the tally, as the results had already been typed up the night before. We handed the results from 5 months study to him today after school. He looked fairly shocked, but also amused. Played softball (again!) in games, rather dull. Never was very good at sports. But hopefully last ever games lesson.
