For an entire  year  I lived off nothing but fast food and water - and survived to tell about it! My rigorous eating schedule played out as follows:  Monday: McDonald's - cheap McChickens Tuesday: KFC - Toonie Twosdays Wednesday: McDonald's - cheap Hamburgers Thursday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Friday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Saturday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Sunday: McDonald's - cheap Cheeseburgers  Quite frankly, I am  very  surprised that I survived the ordeal, and didn't end up morbidly obese or deathly malnourished. One thing can be certain, it most likely shaved several years off my life expectancy.    Currently listening to: Hoffman - Rewired Electronics
