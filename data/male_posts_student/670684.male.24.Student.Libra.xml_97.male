I'm interviewing today at some place in South Austin that does City of Austin web design...I couldn't tell you what the job exactly is, how much it pays, or who I'd be working for if I get it.  And that is because I don't really care.  Yes, I want the job, but it's not that big a deal if I get it or not...I'm fine on money; this would just help get me to Europe for a few weeks this summer.  But comparing this upcoming interview to previous interviews in Austin, I see a huge difference.  I used to go to bed early the night before an interview, get all nervous in the morning, drive out, sit in the waiting area, heart pounding, chest pumping, deep breaths not soothing...once called into play, I'd try to make small talk and nice jokes, but I was nervous and I was desperate...canned chunk tuna was wearing me out.  Of all the interviews I held in Austin, only one went really well; it was September 13, 2001, and I was the first interview after the terrorist attacks for a conference coordinator/tech support position at the UT Pickle Center.  We talked for over an hour about all sorts of things, and the whole thing was at ease; the job was kind of out of my league, so I didn't really strive for it.  Anyway, I got the second interview, and I did well with that, but they ended up scrapping the position because most conferences cancelled after September 11, so the job was redundant.  It would've been $2500/mo and free tuition at UT.  Poo.  For your viewing pleasure, an indication of how  urlLink desperate I was .  Pay close attention to a young Dan Wearsch, in a happy place, before elongated exile from Overland Park embittered his already charred soul.   urlLink Bottle Rocket  is playing at the Union Theatre tonight; free for UT students.  However, Almodovor's  urlLink Talk to Her  is not, though it was advertised at Dobie on Saturday.  Does this mean I settle for  urlLink Nicholas Nickelby , solidifying my place as the gayest straight man ever?  Of course, to be honest to other gay straight men, I did not enjoy  urlLink Yentl ,  urlLink Sordid Lives , or  urlLink Xanadu .  Btw, if you ever want to see how NOT to reference classical art or literature in popular media, look no further than Tina Howe's wretched script  urlLink ">Costal Disturbances , a pointless romp on a beach of broken hearts and apathetic audiences which threw in a meaningless ode to Coleridge's  urlLink Kubla Khan ...no, no... urlLink Dr. Havird  would not be pleased... You people have got to understand ...
