They talk way to fast and they barely make any sense, let alone they don't have any common sense. I also hate it when they attack Bush. (Haha, Kerry wants Bush to not attack him but him and his supporters attack Bush ALL THE TIME!) A big thing that pisses me off is when the supporters of the Kerry Kampaign lie! They lie ALL THE TIME about Bush (and even themselves ;-) ) His supporters are always so "antsy", they are like mad all the time (including Kerry). Should we trust a president who's always mad/angry/pessimist????  The potential is locked for them! HAHA
