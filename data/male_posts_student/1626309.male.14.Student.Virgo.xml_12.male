Well maybe it's not that usual, as Judy will be holding a meeting for people going on the boat trip/dance/prom during that time in the Gym (Porter). Also tomorrow, there will be tours once again of the new building (No Name Yet, I'll just call it the Barn, even though this is the first I've called it that.) That's pretty much it and have a good and safe boat trip/prom/dance/whatever etc. etc. etc.
