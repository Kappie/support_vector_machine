Some friends drinking beer, and pretending they were getting drunk! Just for saying that "i drink beer".. well what can i do? It's just ridiculus. A friend of mine screaming and saying to everyone that her parents were out! Depressing. I'll now say that i didn't drink, because i did, but 1/4 of one can. I don't like beer, the taste makes me ill. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------dropping the subject-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I got a nice e-mail, about how love. I know it's tacky!  The feeling were playing hide-and-seek, exept the fear and the lasyness, the madness was seeking. The hurry was the first to hide, the doubt didn't know where to go, the happyness ran to the garden, the sadness started crying, the envy followed the victory and hid behide him, under a stone. The madness continued to count untill one hundred, the despair got despaired and gave up, the curiosidy couldn't hold itself anymore, and was the first to be found. The feelings were being found one by one. But where was the love? The madness kept looking for it, at the mountains, rivers, swams, forests etc. Then, the madness looked at a rosebush, got a stick and started to spit the branches, suddenly, the madness heard a yel. The love had perforated it's eye on a thorn. The madness got imbaraced and beged for the love's forgiveness, and also promised to follow the love forever. The love acepted the excuses. Today, the love is blind and the madness follows the love all the time.  Isn't it nice?!!!!
