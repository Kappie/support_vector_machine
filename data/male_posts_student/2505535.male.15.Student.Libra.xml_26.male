Ok, friday, Charl managed to get herself grounded for the weekend, oh, and she told me so on msn (see, I said I'd mention that) -  so that lead to no-one coming round on sun, which also meant I managed to get further in Zoo Tycoon Complete.   Saturday, had the normal Theory Class and Clarinet lesson, then sometime in the afternoon Helen came round, we played video games and drank tea. I won every game we played *smug grin* but Helen killed me once accidently in Halo by reversing over me in a warthog, that's a jeep for those non-Halo players. Dave was my only competition, but he can't shoot for shit. Heh heh.  Sunday, nothing happened, if u've been paying attention to this post you should know why. I've been following the  urlLink Nintendo DS  quite closely, some really good games should be coming out soon, hopefully. =D
