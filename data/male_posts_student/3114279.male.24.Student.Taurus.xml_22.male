      Today was my last day of work at the Library. I've feltonly a twingeof sentimentality. As much as I've felt unfulfilled with that job for a while now, and as much as certain people have grated on my nerves or whatever, it has been like a second family in some respects for me for the last five years. I feel like I've grown up there, and I kind of have; I was 18 when I started there. I won't miss it, though. This job just replaced high school for me. It's time to grow up. And actually, when I really think about it, I hate the job now. It was fun for the first couple of years, and it was nice to say "I work at the library," you know, that was good for the girl's parents or whatever, but these last two years I've hated my job, and except for maybe four or five people, I won't really miss anyone. There, now I look like an asshole, but I don't care. This job blows, it's boring, no challenge, the people are uptight (well, that's to be expected, it is a library). I really can't wait to leave. I take it back, I feel no sentimentality.  I found out that I won't be starting work on Monday, due to the difficulties with getting things together from such a distance, and also some of Lake City's "slowness." So I'll have a week in Naples with pretty much nothing to do. I'm trying to see this as a positive, as I'll be able to go swimming, get settled in, get more familiar with the area, go to the movies, etc. etc. I was anxious to start work right away. I'll just have to watch my money.
