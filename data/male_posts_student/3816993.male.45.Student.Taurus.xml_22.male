At one point she notes:    The focus is mainly on spirituality, however. Reading his blog is really mind-blowing for me, because it makes me realize that when he's not on the phone with me demanding that I watch  America's Next Top Model , he's thinking deep thoughts about the Good Book. Such are the complexities of the human soul.   Confession (AKA "full disclosure"): it is true, much to my own further humbling of spirit, that I have and do indulge in watching  urlLink  certain    urlLink  "reality"    urlLink  TV    urlLink  shows  . But, this hasn't distracted me  too  much in my efforts toward spiritual growth. {ahem}   OK, I'll admit it more explicitly:  My name is Joe and I am a closet "reality" TV show viewer.  "Hi, Joe!"  Sometimes people know you too well... {sigh}
