Worked with Shakirra yesterday at the good ol' QI, and lemme jus say that girl is fucking hilarious (HOLLER SHAKI!!!!) As far as  amor , things are not looking all that great. There is  one  dude, but I'm not sure that's gonna go anywhere... dunno why, I just have my doubts.  But I am going to make love in a few minutes... to my mattress and pillows. ;-)       donde estas corazon? ayer te busque entre el suelo, y el cielo, mi cielo y no te encontre y puedo pensar que huyes de mi porque mi silencio una corazonada me dice que si
