Steph seemd to have fun, i certainly did, wont see her now for ages,. shes gonna see red hot chilli peppers.  Gonna meet Cat on wednesday, hope fully aided with alcohol shall forget all of the knowledge i had to gain to do these exams. I'll let you know.  gonna watch beavis and butthead now, its so fun if you turn of your brain and watch it.  WRESTLING BIT enjoyed Raw yesterday, Benoit/Edge/Jericho V Evolution reminded me of the NWA the 80's when a posse of good guys would take on Ric Flairs horseman, Im jus praying that HHH doesnt take Benoits title, after all hes been a great champion.  gonna go to dan e's now, hes pretty kool, appreciates fine comedy, and thats all i ask for. talk soon m.c
