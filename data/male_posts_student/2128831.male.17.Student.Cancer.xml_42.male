About 8 months ago I dyed my hair black, thinking it would look kind of rich and dark and beautiful against my skin. It looked good (if I do say so myself), if not a little goth-like, and appropriate for winter.  As it is now approaching spring, I thought it would be kind of cool to go a little warmer. Perhaps a reddish, auburn sheen. I picked up a bottle of Feria and decided to go for it.  I didn't realize that if you haven't dyed your hair for a while, the growth at the roots, although not drastically different-looking from the bottom of your hair, will absorb dye very, very intensely. Much more intensely than the bottom of your hair. I pulled off the towel to discover that the red sheen I desired manifested as an intense, bozo red at the top part of my head, and the bottom half of my head was an even darker shade of black. It looked like I was wearing a strange, punk-like halo.  This was not the desired effect. Punk-like, I am not, I am but it was bad.  As I drove to the drugstore to purchase a darker brown dye to counteract the bozoness, I thought to myself, "How old am I? How is it that I am still having do-it-yourself hair disasters as a grown-ass?" I decided that an at-home hair disaster makes one officially 17.  Despite my hair fiasco, I have been seriously thinking about cutting my own bangs, thus bringing me back to age 14, then re-highlighted.  And now I want that punk look. At this rate, I'll be a zygote in 3 weeks.  Speaking of chemicals I’m going to go a little nuts over the man’s insistence that bleach must be used – not so much because I think that bleaching whites is evil or anything – but, being me, I’m naturally leery of anything that can ruin a nice pair of black pants of a favorite red shirt. These are things that do happen to me. Therefore I do think that bleach is evil, thus I will continue to be afraid of the bleach bottle/jug/thing anywhere near me, my stuff, or anything that might touch me or my stuff.  Obstuse  I'm going to make my own t-shirts. Thats right - I am looking for a new hobby and I have decided on t-shirts. so why have I decided to do this? Well for one I am tired of not finding t's that I like in the stores. Plain ones are boring, other people's patterns are brutal, and those "need head" shirts piss me off. Plus it'll be cheaper to make fun shirts that i see - thats right - I can rip them off and no-one will be the wiser.  I want also to be creative. I'm going to make a shirt with my resume on it and wear it to job interviews.  I can go into business. I can make "your band is a douche" shirts. We can play with them. I'll get license from that girl who made it first, then we'll sell them at Inside shows. HEY! That’s how I can go to Montreal. I can make a ton of shirts this week and then go as for a business opportunity. I'll sell shirts with words that people won't understand. I'll make clever little phrases. I’m the man.  So bottom line, I'm gonna play a bit. I don't know how long I'll be interested in this. I might lose interest in a week, or maybe five minutes after I post this. Nonetheless it is fun to think about doing stuff. Wooeee... Send me emails with design ideas - little logos you draw, pictures you want outlined or anything. I'll play with it, I'll ask artist people I know to play with them. Somehow, I will wear a shirt I made.  had some major age regression going on this weekend.
