It might not be much at first but then it really gets going with some awesome ninja ass-kicking scenes.  There really isn't much to post other than this today. I'm watching the kids again, possibly all week. This week will blow. Or suck. I won't be sure which one it is until the week is over. I want to eat some pancakes right now.
