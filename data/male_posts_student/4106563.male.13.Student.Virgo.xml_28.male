And no comments, on my profile, it specifically said, "Articles, RSVP!". It wasn't excactly that, you know what I mean. It concerns me when people don't listen to me, also, I want to here what "the people" of Blogger have to say about my articles. Either way, if you say "Get a life, fucker!", I'll represent that, I'd probably track you down on the net and put you down with insults 'til you get irritated and leave Blogger (I probably won't). If you say, "That was awesome, keep that shit up", I'll represent that, I'll do it.  Now, please comment on this piece of shit and my other pile of shit.   RSVP.
