Imay have posted before whatI  wanted  to order, but that has changed now,this is what he  has  ordered:     (btw, if you don't understand, just ignore and move on:/)        2x Opteron 242 1.6ghz 1MB cache 64bit  1x Dual Socket 940 MSI EXT-ATX motherboard  2x WD Raptor 36.7GB 10,000RPM SATA Hard drives  1x RAID controller  2x 1GB PC3200 ECC RAM (yes, 2GB of RAM, muwahaha)  1x Inwin 7010 tower case (very nice, has an intergrated fan controller)  1x 550W Meridian Power supply (uber power)  1x Samsung black DVD-ROM and Sony black Floppy  1x Gainward Geforce 6800 GT *Golden Sample* (pre-o/c, xtra cooling)  1x Microsoft wireless desktop set   Pretty good, no? Plus hes gonna use the 19" Sony TFT he had bought earlier. Ever better, is the fact that I get to swap my crappy Geforce4 Ti4600 with his Geforce6 6800GT! Thing is, I could have got a 6800 Ultra! It was only £20 more, so my dad agreed, but then I realized that my power supplyonly had1more molex connection free, while 2molex connections wereneeded by the 6800 ultra (a molex connection is the thing you power your optical drives/hard drvies with) 1 F£%ing molex connection away froma 6800 ultra! Son of a b#$h!  otherwise, I'm getting a DAH-1000 512MB MP3 player:        and a Dita V3KC (Korean Curve) hockey stick:        Heheheheh, any time soon, I will buy. Kinda need to work on my Flash anim again.      Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
