More then 3 hours (okay, not by much)...it was good, but I still liked the first one the best and I know I would like  The Hobbit  even better.  Today I went to the new library with Dominique and her cousin. Her cousin is a handful, but it was worth it just to be with Dominique. We were going to go bowling, but there was some tournament going on instead, so, after walking all the way from the library to the bowling alley, we went to McDonalds for a bit and then walked all the way back to the library.  Oh yeah; my fingers still hurt. It is real sad when you can't even grip a doorknob without them hurting. Man this sucks...
