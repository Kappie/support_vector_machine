I'm generally good at freewriting, so this shouldn't be too hard, I think. Whats good about this weekend: virtually no homework except for reading chapter 11 in A Separate Peace. The bad: the damned English project that Mrs. Saum (grrr) has brought upon us. So far so good though-I didn't have to burn my grade report before my parents got to it this time. There's too much creative writing in that damned project that I think that I might even fail (gasp). There's also too many dictionaries flying around in the Spanish room every day...lol. I really do wonder when Mrs. Sustic will start noticing that. Although, she did notice when half the room said "la vaca" instead of the right word on the tape. Still...  Well, now I get to go do my weekly chores (whoo hoo). The day may be dreary, but at least the night won't be dull.  Later, Brendan
