It was cool, except for the whole George and Sergio getting messed up and being dumbasses on the drive back home. I'm just hoping those fools made it home in one piece.  Last night I put on a bit of a show crushing and busting open beer cans... it was just like Sierra Vista again. Fitting as Abby had mentioned that she had heard of my reputation from those days. Bessides hanging out with George and Sergio, there was the crew from the night before and Nelson from the freshman year dorms. I think I have a few more people to be adding to Friendster in the near future.  I've really been running my body into the ground the past few days... or even weeks. Andy is gonna be in OC today, and next weekend is the 4th of July and then it's Vegas. That means a lot of booze. I've been eating horribly and not exercising. I actally feel my strength being sapped.  ***
