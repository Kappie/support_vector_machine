I just cant help but think, soon I'm going to be on my death bed, thinking to myself, damn, that was quick.  However dear friends, our lives are in real time and not virtual manifestations. There is no menu, calibration, setting, save or reload.  There is just "Now" and a nanosecond later there'll be a "Then". For now there will always be a "Later", till "Later" when there will be slightly less of a "Later" than "Then". Umm, yeah.  So, anyways, it was a good year. The O'levels are done. No big deal. I have no regrets. What is done is done and cannot be undone. I learnt that from a girl. A special Girl. That's a funny word - Girl... sounds like a noise an animal would make like GRRRR, or SUQAK or MOOOO or HELLO, HOW DO YOU DO?  Next year, I will strive to be academically proficient or at least consistant. I also hope to spend a lot more time furthering my talents in music and drama. Ordinary it may be for now; wait.  You just wait and see.
