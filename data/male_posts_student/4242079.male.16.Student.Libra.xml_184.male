Now he's standing there again. I'm watching him on the security cameras. He quit today, but he was decent enough to give two weeks notice. Lovely. You might say I have no place to talk, since really, I'm doing the same thing he is. Sitting, on a computer, wasting time. Au contraire. I am exhausted. I am tired. I have been working far too much and far too hard. I have also been whining too much. So lets talk about sometihng a little less depressing.  I got a phone call last night from Mel. It was to apologize on behalf of Dayven. I wasn't really expecting to hear from either of them, so it was a welcome surprise. A nice gesture anyway. I never did finish "The Manchurian Candidate" though. Which is fine, the only reason I was watching it anyway is because it has Frank Sinatra in it. Hm.  As soon as this week is over, there are some things I am going to do.  1. Apply at London Drugs. Cooler toys, better pay, looks like less work. 2. If get the job at London Drugs, probably turn it down. 3. Call and spend at least 3 hours with: Ed, Mel, Shyla, Mark (depending on their schedules, of course) 4. Minor tweaks to this webpage.   And that's that. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular,but all probably very difficult to accomplish. I am so unmotivated.   I still need a goddammed hug
