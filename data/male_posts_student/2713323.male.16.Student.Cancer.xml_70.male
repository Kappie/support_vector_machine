Have nothing to do now. i woke up today, and went online for a while, what am i saying, im always online. and zen i went to fareast for a haircut which looks uber weird. Orchards are so crowded with teenagers nowadays, should'nt you people be studying for the upcoming chinese Os! doh. I couldnt even find a seat to grab a bite. So i resorted to coffee. After which i went to play soccer with my estate mates, came back home, studied, and now im here. Super bored. Maybe i'll go watch a movie or go kayaking tml, any takers? o yeah, im not grounded anymore. \m/ cheers.
