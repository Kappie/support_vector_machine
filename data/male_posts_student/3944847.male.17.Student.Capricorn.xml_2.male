I had a "kon lao kuei tiaw" for breakfast xD~...Not too delicious and not too bad either... Then after that , we went home(me and my parents)...I did not study until 10.30am...Just hearing some musics and relaxing myself...Then I started to study until 4.00pm...In between I did chat with friends , replying e-mails , and watching TV too... Man , the TV programmes today were great...Can`t really concentrate in study...After that I took my bath and then started to blog...  Now let me explain about the previous post... I mentioned that she was with her exwatching fireworks... But I didn`t mention that she get back with her ex... Perhaps they "might" get back together but not sure when...Maybe they have been together already...Who knows ? But to tell you all , I will not give up now...I cannot let her know I`m down...Imust continue this battle untill the very end... Until where swords and shields are broken...Maybe I`m giving myself some false hope but this will not be the end... I must continue...
