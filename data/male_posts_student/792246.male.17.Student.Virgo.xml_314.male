Just thinking, sometimes I can't tell the lies from the truth myself anymore. I thought maybe by covering up a few things I could be a person people could like, but no one could even love the fake me.  I don't know who I am, because the lies seem so real. I'll be telling stories and one will come out that I always tell people and I don't even remember until afterwards that I'm a lie.  I think maybe everyone should stop talking to me. It would teach me a lesson.  I create these nice little scenarios that just sound so good that I get wrapped up in them and forget the small factor that they're not true.  Like that last post. I don't even know what just happened. I was trying to be candid, but it just turned into me bullshitting or something and I don't even know why! Am I trying to sell some image of me being some little fucked up youth?  I mean, a lot of it is true, but come on. Like I love myself? I fucking hate myself. But not in a way that interferes with my life, so I just accept it. Whatever.  I don't understand identity. I never could. As long as I can remember I would often just sit and contemplate what it means to be a specific person. Do you ever look in the mirror and wonder why you look back at you? I was obsessive. I still am.  I hate who I am. I can't stand me. I'm not attractive. I'm really not. And the worst is that I go around acting like I think I am, and I know just how annoying that can be to people. I despise people who go around looking like they think they're gorgeous when they're so incredibly ugly. But I'm so insecure about my insecurity that I overplay everything because I can't hear the truth, no matter what it is.  I mean, I don't give a crap about the truth anymore. I just want to hear pretty things.  I don't understand why people like me. They say I'm funny or cute or stuff that I don't even know if it's true, but aside from all that surface stuff, what about me? Why would people like this boring shallow person? I don't really have much to offer anyone. I'm way too obsessed with people's perception of me to give a crap about other people.  And now I'm crying. Hah. It's been a while. Notice how I can only cry when it's about me?  Don't give me sympathy. I really don't deserve it.  Just stop talking to me and maybe someday I'll be able to act like a person.
