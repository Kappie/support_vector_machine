The craft, SpaceshipOne, is supposed to launch at 6:30 am in the Mojave desert.  A plane will carry the craft into the Earth's atmosphere and then release it.  If the flight is successful, this could be the beginning of a new era of private space flights.  UPDATE:  The Mission was a success!   Spyware Illegal?  A U.S. House subcommittee recently approved what could be the very first federal law to make internet spyware illegal.  The SPY Act (Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass) would force companies to warn users that spyware is about to be installed on their computers.  Would companies who provide spyware follow the law?   Hotmail Stepping it Up  Companies who provide free and premium e-mail services are currently responding to the new Gmail service from Google.  Gmail provides users with 1GB (1000MB) worth of e-mail space for free.  Yahoo! recently upgraded their free e-mail service from 4MB to 100MB, ten times less than Gmail.  Yahoo's premium e-mail service provides 2GB worth of e-mail space, double that of Gmail.  MSN's Hotmail has not released any information about how much space they will be providing.  It is rumored that they will upgrade their free 2MB service to 25MB, one-fourth of Yahoo's free e-mail service.  It is unknown how much space that will be provided with Hotmail's premium services.   Weblogs.com Free Service Stopped  Dave Winer, head of Userland's Weblogs.com website, provided 3,000 users with free weblogs.  Dave pulled the plug on the free service last Sunday without warning.  He states that he has health problems and can no longer provide the free service.  Many users were angry because they received no warning.  Users will have access to their archives in the next few weeks.  Mr. Winer hopes to connect users of Weblogs.com with other services that provide free weblogs.
