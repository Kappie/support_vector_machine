Then I came home and sat around for a little bit, but then we decided to wash Lucky's ass. That was, how should I say it? Interesting? After that, I walked Lucky around for a little bit to dry him off. Then my mom let me practice my parralel parking. That was awsome!  I have pictures!     Driving 1   Driving 2   Driving 3   I had such a great weekend!
