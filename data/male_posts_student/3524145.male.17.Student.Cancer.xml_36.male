Nowadays... these days i guess God put me through so much things to teach me ... how to be clean ... how to be pure... how to lead by example... many many more... lots of thoughts have been going through my mind... Hope many of them are actually added God... coz i believe... from those thoughts ... God lead me out of where i not suppose to be...   One of them is regarding BGR... remembered once that Paul ask me.. whats your purpose of having a GF? are you able to support them? are you going to marry her now? ... recently, a week ago... this few questions come back to me again... and i remembered what Paul's answer is.... if you wan to have a Gf is becoz you wan to bring the person into your life ... to be your life partner... and of coz i wun be able to support them if i am not working ... especially when i am still schooling... and also ... since i am not prepared for a marriage ... why look for one?... i really push myself to set my mine... off BGR... and put what Paul says into my mind... wait till i am really able to support a family then i start thinking about it...   I guess people who are close to me have realise the things that have happened recently... i dunno... Devil coming against me? i dunno... just lots of things have been going on lately... and i really dunno what to do...   I am so worn out i guess... really tired everyday... i really want the brothers to grow well into a Man of God... i just wanna do all i can... now i was like trying my best to take out time for all of them... for discipleships... if any of my sheeps actually read this... i would like to say that... if you would like to lighten my job... be more discipline and listen to me... not saying that i say everything is correct... but many times i really say or ask you to do for your sake... i wan all of you to grow strong but one thing is that you need to see the need of it in your own heart...   many times i am just concern and dunno what to do... if you people out there gonna hate me.. or can't take it... i really hope you will understand what i am doing one day... or even not now but one day.... i just wish that that people will start to stand for what is right ... if i am doing wrong ... come and tell me... but i just wish that people will start going again the wrong and distorted truth...    School... Ministry... Friends... Work... Fellowship... Church... Just pray that i cope with the passion and strength of God...
