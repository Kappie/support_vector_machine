I'm getting into sound editing/mixing and I'm a decent mapper. I belong to a gaming clan, Lixasone. We're a motley crew when you first meet everybody, but with a short amount of time you'll see we're a strong gaming community thats queer as hell.Woo  urlLink Lixasone Home page (check out the forums)
