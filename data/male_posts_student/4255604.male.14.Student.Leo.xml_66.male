Not only did the players fight each other like pros, but also there was very little chaos even though the computers had loads of viruses, and we did not have to resort to rude language with anybody. Also, just the right number of people showed up and were finished in just one batch.  The game was timed (15 minutes) and the aim was to get the maximum number of frags. In this case, the winner managed to get 63 frags:  urlLink Sunny Kumar Aditya (XI-K)    I hope that the Class X Domain Square on Monday will be as successful. Now that I think back, we had almost cancelled today's event this morning because of the profusion of viruses, but we fought back the viruses (quite literally) and prevailed victorious.   Thanks to Souvik Das Gupta, Maanick Nangia, Siddarth Nangia for help in organizing the event,  --Karan  PS: Without critics like Souvik who ask for perfection, we can never improve. Perhaps Souvik's eternal expression of "the sky is falling down - do something!!" just might prove to be useful.
