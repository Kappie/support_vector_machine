(i'm typing like a banchi hear. so far i've only taking 8 minutes to write all of this. but what i want to say is coming to me ever so clear.)   this entry was sparked when i looked at everyone's online journals, whatever you'd like to call them. and afterschool today i went over to toms. we talked about a bunch of stuff. we always seem to do when nobody else is around. cause if we talked that honestly with a bunch of people we'd get criticized to no end. i think that's why i've changed the group of people around me. i used to hang out with a big group of people every weekend. yeah there's a lot more personalities with plenty of jokes but there's never that same openness (i spell checked it, promise) with so many people. now i hang out with small amount of people, usually like 4 or 5, which is cool. they listen so it matters when one is going through some shit. oh well back to what i was saying, you can tell what a person's desires and troubles are by reading their writings. like i read angie's older ones and you can tell she was unsure about things for a while. christine's everchanging opinions on everyone. liz's you can see her perpetual boredum with everyday life. brian's complaints about everything laid before him. katie's worries and unbounding humor. kelly's unsteadiness with the opposite sex. and i truly don't mean to start a riot or offend anyone but this is my interpretation of things.   i have this immense feeling of how fast everything is going. i always seem to be occupied by this idea. not to try and seem like a stubborn grandpa complaining how gas used to be a nickel, but things go. they go fast too. i mean look at where you are now. did you imagine it would be like this two months ago? i had no clue what was in store for me. on top of it all this is only high school too. there's so much more opportunity for a countless amount of things to happen to me. i'm waiting here for all this to happen with endless anticipation.
