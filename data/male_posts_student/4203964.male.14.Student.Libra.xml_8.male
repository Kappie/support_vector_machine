We were wondering what the secret service would do if an old college buddy of Bush walked up to him and gave him a friendly puch on the shoulder. Would the shoot him or what?(feel free to comment if u have the answer). Then i was wondering what would happen if an old girlfriend ran up and tackled Mr. President, not knowing he was married. Would the secret service do something about it or would they leave that to Mrs. Bush?
