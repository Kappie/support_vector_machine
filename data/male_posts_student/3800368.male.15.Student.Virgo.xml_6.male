Well yesterday was a pain the ass to start with since i didnt get any sleep yesterday night and i had to ride to EB with to to make up for my laziness from the other day. That was one of the worst bike rides ever. my bike seat broke a-bunch of times  but i was able to repair itand my lock kept falling off. other than that, I chose to ride there on to me, one of the hottest days of the summer. I was soo glad to make it to the store since they have A/C (like any normal store would) and they had spiderman 2 the game demo out on a playable display which was awesome since i stood there and played it for a couple mins, i couldnt really enjoy it cuz Tim kept bugging me -__-'then after a few more mins he decided to go but i wasnt ready at all, that A/C felt like heaven, but i didnt argue cuz it was almost time for me to get home anyway. The ride back home wasnt all that bad due to there being more hills going up while going than coming back. I stopped at 7-11 and got that Sobe energy drink, it reeeally good but i dunno why they come in such small cans. well, the rest of the day was a drag so i'll skip it. Aqua teen was halarious and umnn yea that was the high point of my night...then i went to bed..Today started out ok, i slept til like 12 and ate cherrios, my mom told me to pack some clothes cuz we're staying at the embassy suites cuz my uncle and aunt are coming from ohio for the 4th of july and they're staying there and my mom whats to stay there too, i guess it'll be ok, they do have a indoor pool (awwwesome) and my younger cousin is coming too so thats cool but i doubt other than that it'll be any fun. oh well.  peace.
