White magic shows up through good food, good friends, health etc.  Black magic is about control.  Black magic shows up when you are trying to achieve things like love spells, getting a job, convincing people to do what you want them to do.  Grey (or shadow) magic is the intermingling of white and black.  Most people who claim to be practicing  ' white' magic are infact practicing grey.
