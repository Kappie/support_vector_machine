I started Daily (not that any of you care) Updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been.  Also I can't find the cool IKEA wardrobe I saw in Costa Mesa. Which doesn't put me an any better of a mood about dealing with the suckfest that will be tomorrow. I have to go post "The Box, Part Two"  Oy with the fishcakes already!
