'what am i to say?' i was totally clueless and unsure what exactly was the problem that made her felt this way. I tried to find out yet it was all in vain. silent treatment seemed like an "easy" solution to her problem. i gave up as well coz i see no point in 'digging' out the truth. i just finished my class and it had been a long day of continuous lecture and tutorials. i was devoid of further energy to find out the cause. somehow or rather... things became fine after a while.. it seemed so natural as though nothing happened at all. it puzzled me but at least i know i am in the 'safety zone' now. i have no idea how long more this will go on when school work is starting to pile up... only time will tel yah.
