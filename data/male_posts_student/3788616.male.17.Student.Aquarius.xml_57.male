Crap! argh! haha... however, i am so proud of myself! i have STARTED revising my work! All right! haha... i deserve some applause! *clap clap*  Ok, anyway, i don't think i am going for training tomorrow, the damn injuries are really affecting me, and i guess, i want to spend more time with Chinese Orchestra instead and concentrate on it... yup... will explain why later... Anyway, i didn't get to see Kelly today... and man, i felt so... weird, like... oh wait... didn't get to see as in, she didn't come CO lah! Slacker! haha... no lah, just kidding about the Slacker part! but anyway, yeah... something really felt missing lah, really... like, a part of me or something was missing, that's why i guess... i don't know, was a little bit down and di(de) - spirited...  Heex... ok, anyway, let's not dwell so much into that yeah, i am feeling down and a little bit depressed just at the thought of it... so yeah... anyway, CO... why do i want to put more effort in it? cause, i am in the committee... of course, i am not sure what post i got, but i sincerely pray that i am either the President or the Vice-President lah... yes yes, i know, very high aims and quite ego right? but, well, i believe that i will be able to do a great job lah... so, i pray for everyone's confidence  trust!  Ok, some things to take note for all CO members:      There is going to be 2 upcoming performances, 1 is for Lantern/Mooncake Festival at the Chinese Garderns on the i don't know when... but, the 2nd is that of a West Zone 'concert' held at Clementi Town secondary School from the 11th or 12th - 14th or 15th... yup...     There IS practice on this upcoming Saturday! Attendence is compulsory! So... PLEASE turn up!     Next week Wednesday is the handover 'ceremony' with regards to the J2's stepping down, so, please be prepared to stay back late after normal practice which normally ends around 1730! Food and Drinks WILL be provided... yup, so please make arrangements yeah...   That's about it lah, but anyway... i don't know what it means so hoping someone would enlighten me... Yup, anyway... it is like this lah, Miss Too, the CO teacher in charge was questioning me about my results and my studies, asking whether i was doing anything to improve them... than, later on, she let slip something lah... it went something like, 'you must be able to cope with your studies, if not how are you going to be able to manage the CO well!' so what do you think it means? i am quite confused...  Anyway, here wishing everyone a health and simling day! Do take care everyone yeah! To all those Christians: Let's spread our faith and try to save more people! Yup, that's why i have that verse below! Read it and let's spread the GOOD NEWS! :p smile and have loads of fun everyone! To myself, concentrate on your work and study hard man! Remember to perservere and stay committed! ('o,') For, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" Romans 10:13-15
