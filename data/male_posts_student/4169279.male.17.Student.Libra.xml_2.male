For four years I had the best friend I've ever known. And then something happened. We drifted away from each other. Slowly at first, and then before I knew it, she was gone. I hate how time and emotion blur the past, especially the moments you wish you could keep forever. If only back then I realized how lucky I was to have her as a friend. I'm sorry.       I still hope that one day we will talk again, like we use to. Its 11:11 - make a wish.
