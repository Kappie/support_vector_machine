Well this morning I woke up and I ate meself some cereal, some mighty fine cheerios. After that I went upstairs to my room and onto the computer I went. I didn't do much for awhile except go around to a couple sites. After awhile me and BJ started to play some Warcraft 3 and we did that for a couple hours. Then Cookie came on MSN and me, Wes, Cookie, and BJ were in a convo.... and BJ didn't exactly "fit into" our conversation, mainly because when me, Wes, and Cookie get together our IQ usually drops a point or two. Basicly what happened in the convo was that I slapped Cookie with my eyebrow after she licked it and Wes made a fort inside of Cookie's fort which is inside of her linen closet. Cookie later called BJ a grumpy Gus and logged off. By this time I was starting to get hungry, so I went downstairs and boiled up some noodles for me to eat; I then drank some chocolate milk... mainly because... I like chocolate milk.  After eating me food, I watched the new YuGiOh japanese RAW... lol... I find it funny how we are never going to get the same show that they have, because it's to "violent" for North America. Ummmmm..... o yeah; we were going to go to the pool... but I didn't really want to and Wes couldn't go becaues he had to "pack" for his camping trip. Ash and Steph were gonna come swimming, but decided not to. We eventually ended up........ not going. Then me and BJ continued to play Warcraft 3 and this time we finally got Wes to join in. We have to force Wes to do anything which gets really annoying.......  Ummm...... yeah... k... so I'm off to watch me anime till I fall asleep.  *EDIT*  ok, so I just read BJ's blog and I'm going to have to put this in because.... I don't know.  The following is from Birdy's Daily:  "yeah.. going downtown tomorrow apparently but i dunno what for.. or when.. cuz wes never gives complete instructions... DAMN YOU WES... YOU N YOUR GENGER BREAD MAN... hahaha Wes cant spell.."  O YEAH! well you don't spell perfectly either! and at least I try to have  some  correct grammar in me blog!............................................................. :p.............. k just kidding.... lol  Also, BJ has stolen me template and I am now going to sue him for a gummi bear.
