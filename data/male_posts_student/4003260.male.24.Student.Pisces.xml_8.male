Everyone managed to make it except for cousin Steve who needed to work – poor fellow.  Absolutely adore my cousins Brent and Kirsty from Australia.  There will be no 14-year gap between seeing each other again this time.  Meet Darren (BJ’s fiancé) and had a chance to get to know him at least a little when we went white water rafting.            A crazy busy 5 days the reunion was.  Certainly the best part was going skinning dipping in Windermere Lake with Brent, Kirsty, Mel (Brent’s gf), and my sister.  It turned priceless when a couple of gents came by in a vain attempt to see the girls naked (whom actually were still wearing their undergarments) and were instead greeted by my walking out of the water butt naked.  I gave them fair warning, I honestly did!  Later I learned my father had on occasion gone skinning dipping in the same lake – I love that.  Skinning dipping aside, the ‘story’ of the reunion were the cousins (Brent, Kirsty, my sister, and myself) branding ourselves with a tattoo – the Chinese symbols for family.  Guess we are too old to shock the family anymore, as everyone seems to love it – even my grandmother!  My dear father certainly appear rather stunned – good to keep the old man on his toes. Slowly leaking out the word to my friends whom are surprised to say the least.  Sarah definitely seemed a little shell-shocked!    Apart from that, there was white water rafting (fantastic!), a little Karaoke (Aussie cousins singing Land Down Under, all of us singing Summer Nights), some dancing (doing the Happy Dance), a few drinks, and taking it easy at the beach.  Thanks for the late night Playmate poker Kirsty.  You really sold me on Australia with your description of the Fairy Penguins!  Missing you a ton.
