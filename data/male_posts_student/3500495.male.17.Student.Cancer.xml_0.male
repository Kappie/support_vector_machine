Since a number of aspects and conditions have influenced my development and growth as a person, I find it extremely difficult to single out a sole influence that determined who I have become.  However, the one aspect of life that has set me apart from the group, the event that has taught me to regret the transgressions of the past and yet remain optimistic about the future, the one part of life that has defined, influenced, and motivated me to succeed in life is my father’s desertion of my family when I was barely old enough to comprehend what he had done. 	Though the loss of a parent may seem extremely tragic at first, growing up with only my mother and younger brother has taught me a great deal about life that most teenagers unfortunately do not experience until going off to college and living on their own.  While I became forcefully more acquainted with domestic chores such as cooking for my family, doing laundry, and even gardening, the experience has also brought me to deeper, more meaningful discoveries such as the value of hard work and determination.  To this day, I believe that I can accomplish anything if I work hard enough at it; when I go out and truly work at something, I never let any obstacle stand in my way nor allow any ties restrain my unfettered freedom and goal of doing my best, doing the best, at anything I do.  Whether it be playing Chopin Etudes on the piano, out-driving my friends on the golf course, delegating at Model United Nations Conferences, or getting straight A’s in school, all of my successes (and failures) stem from a sense of self-reliance, responsibility, and diligence all resulting from growing up taking care of the house while my mother went to work. 	Coupled with a disdain of evil in the world and education at a Catholic high school, my resulting strong system of morals and ethics allow for me to have sympathy for the people of the present and optimism for the society of the future.  Growing up in South Florida, an area of strict obligation to follow absolutely no moral code, I aspire to greatness, morality, and most of all happiness.  Still, only strength of mind and resolve to work diligently at a goal with allow me the resolve to meet my objectives. As one esteemed professor once told me, “Persistence overcomes resistance.”  I believe that if you work hard enough at something, persistence will indeed overcome resistance.  Never let anything get in the way of your dreams.
