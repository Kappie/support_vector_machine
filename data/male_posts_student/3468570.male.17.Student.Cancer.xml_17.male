It seems so long ago when you read about such diary entries too. Anyway, that date was the year when Christopher Columbus left Seville port in Spain for the Carribean which he deemed it to be Asia intially.   What was I supposed to say anyway? Oh yes, I had been very bad at speaking other languages actually. Like for example, you are not supposed to call Octobre as 'Oct-to-breh' but simply call it as it was pronounced in English. And the word depot is not supposed to be called 'de-port', but simply as 'dere-poh'. Believe it or not, it is true. (Too much French influence infused into le Language I guess.) And 'le' is used as an emphasis in American English, with courtesy of UrbanDictionary of course! So this is le diary de le me le et cetera. But it's not uncommon 'cause I've been using it for ages to irritate many friends so that they will say 'ENOUGH OF DIE FRENCH CULTURZ'! Yap..it's made to sound German with all the crazy Zs at the back of le some words.  Never mind...it's so lame. And I guess no one will ever understand my jokes unless the person is usually English-educated and has a wide knowledge of Hollywood gossip. (Mmmmm!) Paris Hilton is also stupid too, with her blond hair, and her smarter companion of Nicole Ritchie. [She smears the name of Lionel Ritchie, and Paris smears the great Hilton empire with The Simple Life.] And I can't really accept that Kathy Hilton is gonna' make a new drama called The Good Life but it's kinda' nice to watch 'cause rich upperclass ladies can be seen bitching each other around too.  In Deo Nos Credamus! The original motto of the United States in Latin. But look at the country, are they really trusting God these days? Are they fearing God these days? And for those who suck at Latin, the Latin motto means 'In God We Trust'. And for those Latin experts, I use 'nos' to emphasize le motto. If not it will be known as In Deo Credamus, which is definitely not emphasized at all! Lingua Latina lingua bonam est! Go find out for yourself if you have no crazy idea what the above sentence Latin means!   Okay, cannon saliva I am! How about rest some? Now, goodbye!
