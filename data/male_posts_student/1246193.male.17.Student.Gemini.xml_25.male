I enjoy not having homework, especially in Algerbra. I am thinking that there probably aren't a whole lot of classes that you look forward to tests in. I like algebra tests.  They mean no homework the night before or the night of the test.  Unless of course you study.  I don't.  I really never have. I get very bored studying.  I seem to retain knowledge fairly well. Also, I honestly don't know that studying would help me do all that much better.  Who knows? Maybe I should try it.   How many times do I have to tell you people that I am right and you are wrong?  In art, I tell Judd not to use so much stain. Does he listen? Of course not! The bell rings. Everyone runs to lunch. I continue picking up the mess SOME of us made. The stain had soaked through the paper. It was on the desk.  I had to clean it, although I really didn't mind. Turpentine really stinks. It is so oily and greasy. I have to give a special thanks to Sam P. for helping me clean. Mrs. Benepe asked me while I was cleaning up if Judd knew that the stain had been there. I told her that he didn't and it wasn't any big deal for me to clean.  She later calls him to her room to ask him a question about a test he had taken.  He thought he was in trouble.  Told her that he had done it. Besides making himself look stupid (which isn't that hard to do) she probably thinks that I lied to her.  At least this is the story that I heard. May not be true, I'll find out tomorrow. Wasn't that big of a deal and although it sounds like it, I am not mad at all.  I found it kind of funny. In all truth, that is all I had to blog about.  My life is so incredibly boring.  Except for Star Trek. What would I do without the Star Trek Universe. Who cares? I am a true trekkie, not a trekker.  I'll explain the difference in my next blog.  You might actually find it interesting!  Procrastination equals Stupidity.  I don't know what this has to do with anything, but it is the truth.  Just think about it.
