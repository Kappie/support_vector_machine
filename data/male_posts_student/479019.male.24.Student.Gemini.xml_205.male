I made chicken and pasta for them. We made it a somewhat formal dinner and Steff made dessert. Steff and Janet shared their stories of their trips to Europe and we all hung out. It was just a nice evening. I'm really going to miss the girls when I leave for Binghamton. The truth is that I know them, but I don't know them as well as I'd like. That's considering that I consider them the best friends I've made in my undergrad days. I would say them and PM are the friends I feel I know the most from my undergrad days. They're really people I'm going to miss. I'll also miss the beers with Alex and Makino. They were cool drinking buddies. It's going to be interesting leaving familiarity and starting a new life.  ***
