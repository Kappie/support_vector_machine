We played on Tony Hawks for a bit then when it was Chris' turn on the PC we went on it and Chris recorded a brill version of Gary Jules - Mad World in the voice of Mrs. Checketts, with altered lyrics!  We had so much fun messing around with the voices and stuff again.  After, me and James came back to my house for a bit and waited for Chris to finish his dinner, then walked all the way back again (Chris!!) to force him to come out.  We went to call for Craig again, who came out with Sam, but then went striaght back in to watch LoTR RoTK, so me Chris and James ventured past his house to the Motorway bridge.  It's nice watching the traffic.  Chris used the word 'Romantic' but I didn't quite think so with the roaring traffic going past (He also mentioned the name of the person he fancies but I can't repeat it without risking my life :P)  I'm about to fall asleep sitting here at my computer.  I better do some revision tomorrow for the upcoming tests at school.  Yeh, that place we're currently away from.  Now would be a great time for the school to catch fire *HINT HINT ARSONISTS*
