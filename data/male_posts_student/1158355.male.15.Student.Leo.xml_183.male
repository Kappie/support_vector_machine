Kraken was the best roller coaster in the entire trip and the animals there were hilarious and intelligent. I also got sprayed with Dolphin ooz. Tuesday was Universal Studios. Terminator was fun, Shrek was fun, Earthquake was great, and Back To The Future kicked ass! I kept pressing all the buttons and calling out random command words like MOVE INTO ATTACK POSITION! or BOOSTERS RUNNING NOW! and when the big jump came I yelled at HYPERJUMP NOW!...I got carried away. For the people who don't know, Back To The Future is a simulator car that takes you through time and has a bunch of buttons for show that you can press but it's awesome because it even shows the year on the car at the current year your in in the movie. Wednesday was MGM. One ride made my entire trip. Tower of Terror. I mean Star Tours, Indiana Jones show and Rockin Roller Coaster were good, but this ride was the most fun ride I've ever been on, well besides Nitro. You're in this elevator and the guy goes WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE and VOOOM! you drop a million and fly back up and so on. Thursday was Epcot. Things were fun, the Italian restaraunt made me happy. Mission Space was so good I got a shirt from it, in fact I'm wearing it to school tomorrow. This ride takes you from Earth to Mars, it's so damn real. I went on it twice and almost puked. Well I did puke...I mean...not yet. Friday was lay back at Vistana Resort day. Then hell came forth...when I ate at Zimmie's...just that name makes me wanna puke. I had Zimmie's (it's a restaurant in my resort) for lunch and at night right before bed I wasn't feeling too good. Turns out 3 in the morning, I puked out half of my body. My dad didn't feel good along with mostly everyone else who ate at Zimmie's. My dad and I stayed up until 5:30 watching this movie called The Funhouse. It's supposed to be scary but it's funny because it's old and lame. Ask your parents about it, they might know it. I'm too lazy to explain what it is, or just im me...you know what, I'm gonna tell you. It's this haunted house carnival gypsy land where these 4 teens get off in the middle of the ride and have sex in the haunted house and stay there but find out there's some monster in it. It kills them all except the 1 brunette girly who kills it by electrifying it. I think the monster was made when this man fucked a sheep or something. Weird. Then Saturday was nothing but rough. Animal Kingdom, I could barely walk around because I was tired as hell and barfing killed all my muscles and popped all the blood vessels around my eyes so I kept my eyes closed and walked behind mommy. Haha, no I'm joking but I did keep my eyes dimmed and shades on. I look like a murderer with sunglasses and a hood, so Ima gonna keep wearing em. It makes me feel good. I'm tired, I'm going to bed in a few minutes but first I gotta finish writing, I mean typing. God damnit I forgot all about this damn writing lab report I have to do. Ah fuck it. I have so much shit to catch up on tomorrow. I need sleep, I need to drum, double homework (todays and tomorrows) and drum lessons. And uh...other stuff that keeps my self esteem happy. Well homework doesn't make me happy. But drums do so I don't stop drumming. Ok anyways back to Saturday, Animal Kingdom was ok. We didn't spend much time in it. The Lion King show was magnifecent, I fell for Pochohantaus and the Dinosaur Travel Through Time Ride kicked major wung ho. At night it was Magic Kingdom and I finally went on Splash Mountain, haven't gone on it since I was 5. Didn't go on it 3 years ago because it was broken down. Also the new Mickey 3D movie is awesome. You can even smell the apple pie. Well, then it was time to hit the rode. Back home, woohoo! I was glad, I missed Smithtown and all my friends but definetly not school. Pretty soon I'm gonna be wishing I was on vacation again. On the way home I saw a truck for VIRGINIALINEN (www.virginialinen.com) and I first saw it as VIRGIN ALIEN. Take out the 3rd I in Virginia and the first N in Linen. So you get VIRGIN ALIEN IN and IN can stand for International or something so it's INTERNATION VIRGIN ALIENS. Good band name...not! Oh boy somebody kill me my life is pointless. I can't stand pretending I'm enjoying it. Do I even know what I'm talking about? I'm a humongous skitzo. I got home and people start giving me bad news. People down south sure are friendly. Kyle Moronvinsky's house smells good, he watched my bunny, now my bunny smells good. I'm home now. Happy? I'm not sure. I dont wanna go back to school. I hate it all. I hate it. Fuck this all, does this, any of this that we're doing have any purpose? Why do we live the way we live? We made ourselves believe this is the way to live, but it might not be. It just might not be. School is for dummies. Irony? Yes? No? Perhaps with 1 tsp. of sugar? "Tsp, whats a tsp?"..."TEASPOON!" Sleep Beauty Everybody...no shit. Has somebody been giving me nose candy in my sleep?
