I especially liked  urlLink Paul Well's  response:   Jack Layton may or may not be right that Paul Martin holds responsibility for the death of homeless Torontonians. But as a general proposition, it's not only clear that public policy can affect the manner and rate of human death â€”  it's obvious .   But of course Layton is in a world of trouble. Here in Canada, we like our public debates as vapid and divorced from reality as we can get them.   Also notable was Paul Martin's impassioned response: "Mr. Layton is condemned by his statements."   Huh?  Paul put on his sad face and delivered another round of PDS (Paulian Disingenuous Sanctimony):  "There will be many blows in politics and some of them are going to be low. I think that kind of statement reflects more on Mr. Layton than anything else...It's exactly the kind of remark that discourages them (young people), and I think it is most unfortunate...Politics is about the clash of ideas and I'm quite prepared to take Jack Layton on on his ideas."   Hello?  Which party  urlLink leaked its attack ads  two weeks before the election campaign even began?
