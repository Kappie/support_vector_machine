Is there a truth to death? Or at the time of our death  We are instantly born again with a new life and identity?  How can I tell if you are real? What if these "Thoughts" are a message?  A message telling us that everythin's not real?  Or is the message a lie? Beguiling our beliefs?  What if we are awake but in truth asleep?  And what if we are asleep but in reality awake?  Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts  Never-ending, eternal, defiling our souls  Never let it stop
