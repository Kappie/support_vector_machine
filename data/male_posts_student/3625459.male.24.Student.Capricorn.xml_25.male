He;s the geek in all of us, moreover he's got class, hes good looking and well manered. He's commited to his family and work. Havent seen him using a lot of swear words in his movies. His comedy is not like jim carrey's or adam sandler's in your face kind of a comedy. His one liners are witty. (Boy... am i rambling or what).I like him beacuse i can identify withsome of the characters he's protrayed.      The Mummy  Rick O'Connell... Hangman: Any last requests, pig?  Rick: Yeah, loosen the knot and let me go.  Evelyn: By the way, why did you kiss me?  Rick: I don't know. I was about to be hanged. It seemed like a good idea at the time.    George of the Jungle  George have strring of special feelings right now..good thing shes same species   Blast from the Past    urlLink Adam : Uh, Eve, this is Adam. Look, I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me. And I wanted to tell you that I... that uh... that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of your dreams come true, and... and that's all I... and that's all.    that ^^ C is for you .
