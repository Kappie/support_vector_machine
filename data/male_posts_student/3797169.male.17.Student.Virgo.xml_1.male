Me "Really, I don't want to know!"   Guy "And then, blah blah blah...and he blah blah blah. So anyway...any news from you?"   Me "Wow, did I tell you, I heard you got bitch slapped today?"   Guy "No...I didn'tget slapped today? (confused)"   Me "Well then, here you go!"   **SLAP!!!**      Ok, that's one slap. The other is, The Lex...rechristened by Sir Cam of Nasty...has recieved it's first dose of BOOM! Care of either Alex or Amir, depending on who wins the fight tomorrow. I got a 12" Sony subwoofer in a Rockford Fostgate competition series sealed box. It sounds nice, but I haven't heard it in the Lex. I still need to get and amp and wire it up, Amir should have that all taken care of in a few days and I'll be happy, and Cam will love ridin' in the Lex even more.      Well, maybe next time we head to PCC for more estranged incedents, we'll be listening to an even better "almost" stock stereo.
