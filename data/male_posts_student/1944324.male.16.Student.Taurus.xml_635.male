October - AngelsInAmericaCon  January - WonderfallCon March - Monty Py-Con  May - FamilyGuyCon  Yes, you read that right. I'm devoting an entire con to the British Comedy stylings of Monty Python since neither Movie nor MusicalCons panned out. Enjoy! (Technically there already was a MusicalCon, I just wasn't there. I'm just sayin...)  Also Marten, I so want to see the cornrow pictures.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
