I'm here, with you, beside you, To guard you and to guide you . . . CHRISTINE Say you love me every waking moment, Turn my head with talk of summertime  Say you need me with you, Now and always  Promise me that all you say is true  That's all I ask of you . . . RAOUL Let me be your shelter, Let me be your light. You're safe No one will find you Your fears are far behind you . . . CHRISTINE All I want is freedom, A world with no more night  And you always beside me To hold me and to hide me . . . RAOUL Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime Let me lead you from your solitude Say you need me with you here, beside you  Anywhere you go, let me go too . . . Christine, That's all I ask of you . . . CHRISTINE Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  Say the word and I will follow you . . .  BOTH Share each day with me, each night, each morning . . . CHRISTINE Say you love me . . . RAOUL You know I do . . . BOTH Love me that's all I ask of you . . .
