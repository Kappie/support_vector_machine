BOO FUCKING HOO... hell ill have you help me get him to notice me theyll say..... wtf... WHY?! .... its always this way.. just the extent changes.. sometimes its just a minor infatuation... sometimes its fullscale making out in front of me... anyone else... i wouldn't mind.. but no... always always always has to be someone i like.... sweet .... sometimes i really hate my life.... just for once... for once i wish things could go my way sometimes .... really... i cant think of something in this same "arena" that has gone my way EVER.... really ... i just get fucked over and over and over... its a big cycle of excitement but ultimately always let down... and if you see me and im having a good day or im in a good mood... well then..know that that must be too good to be true and in a day or two ill be back to being depressed and mad... wow.... life sucks.. im going to bed... maybe ill wake up and feel better ... chances are no.... (the best would be .... something to the point of this quote by eels "I like waking up after a bad dream Makes it feel like life ain’t bad"... yeah i want to have a bad dream....) good night hopefully nightmares are on the way....hopefully you had a better day than i did.. really... no one else should have to go through all this shit
