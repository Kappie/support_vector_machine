Now before I get the "it's okay to be home" and "it's okay to spend time by yourself", I do that during the week plenty, it's not about being alone for only 5 minutes with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. At any rate Friday nights alone suck. Maybe it's just this one, since Valentine's day is tomorrow, and I hate even the thought of that holiday... of love, of people being sweet to each other, of couples looking into their partner's eyes and knowing they are safe.  So it's just me, the TV, Doc Otis, and an empty apartment... except for me.  Here's to friday night's alone.
