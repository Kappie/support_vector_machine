First, anyone who knows me knows I hate the United Kingdom, and anyone who knows I hate the UK knows I hate Stacey Mellish.  Sure, I don't actually  know  Stacey, but that doesn't stop me from hating her does it?  Besides, she's always bugging me, and it seems no one from the UK can spell.  My good old friend Shum (*tips hat*) introduced me to Stacey  Faggish  a while back, and hilarity ensued.  Today was different.  Why?  Because I went to hotmail, looked at her secret question and then simply said, "Stacey, what's your dad's middle name?"...A couple seconds later, "Anthony."  I proceeded to change her password to ' stupidf ' (yes, stupidf) and logged onto her account.  I had nothing planned, it just happened.  Anyways, a bunch of her friends started talking to me, and I saved a couple conversations, and well, they're funny.  I am here today to present to you  the Mellish archives :     urlLink Eine ,  urlLink Zwei ,  urlLink Drei ,  urlLink Vier  The messages in  blue  are from me. The information at the top of each convo is stuff I got from their profile.
