I had a profoundly mood-altering conversation with a new friend, and it sorta put things in perspective for me again.  Yes, I'm sick of being weak and predictable.  I'll get over it.  I always do.  Today is our second day off of the summer, and it's... raining.  Gah.  Well, not raining yet... but overcast and on the verge of rain.  Oh well... plenty of good stuff to do while it's like this.  Tonight, I'm going to the Barnstable County Fair.  I've never been to a county fair, but I'm told they're fun... and I'm definitely up for fun.  We might go deep-sea fishing, too... that could be fun, as well... but I need to go to the mall.  Anyway, that's all for now, I guess.  The wine and cheese party at the Sound house last night was fantastic... my new favorite party of the summer.   And apartment hunting is turning up some fun prospects.  That's all from me right now.  I'll write more later, I'm sure.  Hope all is well with you.
