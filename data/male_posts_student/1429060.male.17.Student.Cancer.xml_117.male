Alanna was there this morning taking the SAT I, so I got to see her and hang out for about ten minutes and sing about ice cream men. And a surprising number of familiar faces were there also: besides lovely lanna, I saw laylee, brock, elise, LA, lauren, dan ying, etc. Fun faces, I say. I needed that boost.  New meds probably start tomorrow morning. The fucking pills are huge, so let's hope they are worth it. Alanna, Amber, Heather, I may be out for a week or so, because the stuff causes, apparently, spontaneous dizziness and drowsiness. Not that I am already free of dizziness already. Blegh. And I apologize if I am hostile to anyone in the next week; the meds can cause hostility to an extent for a little while.  Not hungry right now, while everyone is eating my recipe of shrimp/chicken pasta. Odd. I am usually ravenous. I dunno. I want to see someone right now. Like Alanna. Let's do something Alanna.  Cheers.
