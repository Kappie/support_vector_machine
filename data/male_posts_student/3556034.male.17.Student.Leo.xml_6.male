We had a bbq the day before with a few friends and family of mine.     It was pretty fun, then the next day Yvain, April, David, and I went to the movies and saw Anchorman. Yeah I had really wanted to see it for the longest time and everytime we went to the movies nobody wanted to watch it so we went since it was my b-day and all. But, it ended up being kind of a dissapointment, I mean there were some really funny parts in it but in all there was seriously no meaning to the entire movie. But oh well, at least I finally saw it. What else, oh! I almost forgot, I was bidding on this nice Alpine head unit on ebay for my car for a while and I won it! I was really surprised because it's almost brand new and there was only one other bidder on it so I won for $67.00. In fact I got it in the mail yesterday whileI was at work so Julia being the bad ass that she is went and got it for me so no little kids would steal it off of my porch. But anyways it's really nice and today I am going to go buy the wiring harness, antenna, and installation kit. Right now I'm debating whether or not to install it myself or just have best buy do it for $45.00. Today is going to be another busy day, I'm going to go have breakfast with my recruiter for the National Guard today in about another hour and we're going to finalize all the paper work after he meets with my mom later on. Then after that I have to go to the...DPS...yes that's right, that means waiting in line for about an hour to an hour and ahalfso I can get my license renewed. Afterwards I'm probably gonna go to Lindale and play a little bball for a while until I have to go to work, unless I decide I am going to install my cd player myself, which in that case I'll be doing that instead of going to go play. Then at 5:00 I have to go to work until closing which tonight is like 11:30 I think. Hopefully on sunday I'll get to work morning because it's my last day before two-a-days start for football so I don't really think I'll be having many more late nights after those start. Well anywaysthat's about all the major things that have happened in my life for a while, soI'm going togo ahead and sign off here and take a shower to get ready for breakfast. Duece.
