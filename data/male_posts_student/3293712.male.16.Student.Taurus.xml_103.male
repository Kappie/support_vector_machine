So, I oblige and take time to go pick them up."  I took time to pick you up tons of times in the 5 months before you had your license. Often, I voluntarily picked you up.  Far be it from me to be suspicious, but maybe you had an ulterior motive here? No doubt you wanted Pammy to see your "wacky" friend Chris or something. I know you  could  have picked us up before going to see Pammy, but whatever.  "What do they do? They leave their trash all over my car."  I'm sorry for leaving a napkin your  precious  floor, because I know for sure you  always  took everything you ate and drank in my car and threw it away. To those who haven't ever rode in my car, that was sarcasm.  "Then, when I throw it out, Chris fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car."  The reason Chris "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car" is because he was pissed at you. He had good reason to be pissed at you, because you were being an asshole to him. Actually, you are always an asshole to him. I don't know why you get a superiority complex every time Pammy rolls around, and it pisses  everyone  off, not just Chris. Besides, Chris has "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car" before, and on me. You should just accept Chris as himself, because throwing shit is what Chris does. It is his calling or something. It was done as a joke, and I don't doubt that you would have done the same to him. I seem to remember you thinking it pretty funny when Chris "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car."   We don't care if you go out with Pammy. In fact, we are happy for you. But you don't need to treat us like shit and act like you're better than us when you are around her. You don't need to change yourself for her, because if she won't accept you for who you are you shouldn't be with her anyway. Eventually all you will have is Pammy because you have alienated us so much. If you would rather hang out with Pammy, cool. I'm not bitter because you won't hang out with me. A lot of people won't, not just you. You shouldn't lie to us, or act like an asshole to us, though. To tell the truth, I see through your bullshit quite easily.  Your relationship with Pammy and your relationship with your friends are seperate things, and you don't need to prove anything to us or her, so please stop. I'm sure you would rather hear it from me, because Chris can't articulate it, and everyone else will just keep it to themselves until they don't want to be your friend anymore. Again, I'm just telling you because maybe you don't consciously realize it.   When we were in your car, I didn't say anything about your punkness. I don't need to. I wondered why you had  The Empire Strikes First , because you have said several times that you don't really like BR and I would guess that ESF is a type of album you don't like. The reason me and Chris were pissed is because it is not a "John" record. It doesn't sing about girls or anything like that, and raises valid questions, something you don't normally deal with in music. I wasn't questioning your punkness, I was questioning your motives in buying the album. Do you like Bad Religion, or are you trying to pad your record collection to impress people? The reason I said to shut it off is because BR is a band I listen to every day, a band I love. I will listen to it regardless of who I am with. No doubt you thought some BR would give you some music cred and make you seem like a deeper person. To quote Erik, "Music is for self-expression, not exploitation." BR is my favorite band, and to see someone carelessly use a BR record made (makes) me mad. I turned you on to a lot of the music you listen to, and it makes me sad that you threw away the ideas while keeping the music. No doubt if Mike listened to LTJ it would piss you off.  Yesterday I got three new CDs:  Bad Religion's   The Empire Strikes First , which I had been anticipating for months, the Clash's  London Calling , and  Streetcore , by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. All three are very enjoyable. I won't bore you with the details, just make you listen to the music when you're riding in my car.  Hawkeye, I would've picked the corn. We were just giving you a hard time because we had nothing to do. We are all a little burned out on Halo, but maybe we could do a small thing at Chris's house this weekend.  Jefe- I forgot to count you when I said Dustin is the worst Halo player. You are the worst.  It is going to be hard to get up for work tomorrow morning. 8:30 is freaking early for me, considering I had to get up at 11 on Tuesday and I felt horrible. Lucky, the Dairison has strong coffee.  I miss the sense of urgency I had during school. During school I had to pack as much fun as I could have in a limited space, and now I can spend a whole afternoon visiting people's houses, even though I'm not sure if they are home. It's the journey, man, not the destination.  I guess I'm not really in a blogging mood today. Maybe tomorrow I'll encounter more interesting things.
