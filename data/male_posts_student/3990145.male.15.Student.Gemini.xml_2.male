We went to school just like an normal day, assemble, then the party begins~! Seriously, I didn't espect so many students to come in their traditional costume... AndI didn't wear because I don't have one and don't really have much Malay friends to borrow from... The celebration was some what like a "pam-sum-ma-lum" haha.. We can walk around freely and then we can also buy food and other stuff from the stores. Someone of my friends went to watch the Chinese chess competition. Actually I found it quite boring... Hahaha... We walked around for a whileand then finally bought some food and settle down in the canteen to eat them! Yea!!! Wahahahaha... After a while we had to gather in the hall to watch the concert...        The concert was quite nice actually and I think I really enjoyed it. After the concert, my friends and I met up at the canteen and then decide what to do next. Then We(Irwin, Wei Jie, You Lun, Ser Chin, Alvin, Ivan and Me) decide to go play basketball... We went to the basketball court near Khabit MRT station and then the time then was about 3 p.m? After playing some games, Andrew came and then Samatha and Min Yi... The girls didn't really play, they just stood there and watched... When it was about 5p.m, some "Haro Bikers" came. They were from OPSS too... One of them is my counter-strike clan member!! Wahahahaha... Then they jio us play match... Haha I think we(Andrew, Alvin and me) play jian then win... At first they keep scoring but we didn't really remember the score, then someone I suggest 7 balls start "now". Because we had the ball in our hand that time, we kept scoring then win... Wahahahahaha jian right!? But that doesn't mean I am a jian ren lor... Hehe
