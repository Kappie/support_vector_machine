Those classes really provided foundations for a lot of what I'm interested in and do now in graduate school. Without a doubt those classes really molded how I approach my academic work. The two core series I took at UCI had a profound impact on me, because of their interdiscplinary approaches to studying visual, as well as historical artifacts and events. They made me thinking of the cultural, political, and economic relavences and contexts of art, architecture, and even literature. At the same time they really made me think about how academic disciplines should be irrelavent because they are unrealistic in understanding the world.   This is just something that I was thinking about as I made photocopies earlier tonight, because in several of my courses right now I'm building on these courses and some of the issues about disciplinary boundaries have been popping up a lot lately.  I'm thirsty... for beer.  ***
