I was supposed to go clubbing last night, but I decided that I didn't want to waste the money on a cover... heh so Brandon and I went to Pasadena anyway, but not to Q's. We went to a bar got buzzed... walked around and the had a few more beers at Hooters. Man... now my wallet is empty. But I guess it's worth it. It's cool to hang out with the friends before I leave. That's especially since I won't see them for many months.   Actually I'm a bit concerned about money right now. I screwed up on my financial aid... I allocated the extra money I had needed to buy a laptop to the spring semester and not the fall. I had planned to get laptop today, but now I'm all like worried if I should still get it. Then again... no tv or computer in an apartment by myself would suck ass.   I guess I'm off to Fry's anyway.  **
