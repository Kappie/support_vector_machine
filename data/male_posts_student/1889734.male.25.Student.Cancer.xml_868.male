Since Bush took office we've lost 1.8 million private sector jobs. Even since the end of the recession – and even over the last 12 months – job growth has been the weakest we have seen since the 1930s.  Every month, approximately 150,000 more people enter the workforce. Bush has created more than 150,000 jobs  only FOUR of the past 41 months .  Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Economy.com and others have all found that between 66%-90% of new jobs are being created in low-end industries and occupations (lower wage jobs), and that the growth in temporary jobs continues to outpace full-time hiring.  Our economy has  7 million fewer jobs  than Bush's own Council of Economic Advisors projected it would have by now.  This year, more of the unemployed have been out of work for more than six months than in any year since 1983.  There are over 4.5 million workers that are working part-time, getting no benefits, because  they can’t find full-time work  (1.3 million more than when Bush took office).  Real weekly wages of average workers have actually fallen since the end of the recession.
