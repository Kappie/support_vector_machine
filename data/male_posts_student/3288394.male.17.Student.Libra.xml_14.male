I have to find that frigging list Coward gave us! (speaking of which, he's  never  on AIM.. :( *sad*...)   Woohoo! I made it into Babbs' journal! actually I made it in a while ago, butI just now found out.  So tonite, my mom made some crazy chicken stuff with curry and rice and it's all like, awesomely good. Oh! We watched Timeline. It's not as good as the book, but as a standalonemovie it's decent. My cousin loves it but she wasn't here tonite. I think she's in New Hamster with UB... mebe she's in Oklahoma, I don't know. Anyway, we'll see her AND Katie there after Teen Camp in August. Katie's staying until  Labor Day!!  That's crazy long, like, five weeks!  Anyhoo, I'm feeling mutch better than the last time I posted... mutch? much? Munch! *munchmunchmunch* heehee! I need to sleep, but I'm actually having fun.  I took these weird personality tests online today. They aren't very good. I got the links from this girl I know (well, not really  know  know as much as met online at a forum and now I know what she looks like (pretty) because of this "let's see what everybody looks like" thread) anyhow I got the links and the tests were stupid and wrong and I'm off track of what I was thinking about... my train of thought derailed and all passengers were killed. ::sad::  My dad says this is playing so I need to stop soon, but this post is plenty long. *looks at top of post* shoot! I still need to find those books! well, the list at least. BTW, I saw Paycheck yesterday and it was awesome. I rather think Ben Affleck is a good actor. Speaking of Affleck, (no duck jokes please...) Damon! I want to see The Bourne Supremacy soooooooo bad! ... as i said, this post is long enough. I might rant again tomorro. tata!
