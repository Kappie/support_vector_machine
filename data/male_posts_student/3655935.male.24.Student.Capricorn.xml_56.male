Even if you don't love sports, I think you would benefit from reading some of his work.  I like to dip into his writings every now and then, and I always come away satisfied.  Here are some recommendations:   urlLink The Jeopardy Guy ,  urlLink Laker's Ignore History  (for trading Shaq),  urlLink Bill's Trip to Vegas ,  urlLink Running Commentary on Wrestlemania XX , and  urlLink Dazed and Confused  (A movie review of  Dodgeball ).  Or you can check out the  urlLink index of Bill's articles .  Enjoy!
