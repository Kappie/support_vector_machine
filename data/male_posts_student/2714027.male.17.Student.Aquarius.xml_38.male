Apart from work on Saturday afternoon I'm free to just do whatever I want to do. I think a spot of game playing and reviewing is in order, and maybe a major resort of my music on the PC and a general tidyup of my files. I might also watch some of my  24  DVD boxset.  Today it was my Dad's birthday and he got an iPod as well as our new car turning up. Far too many toys than is good for him, you know. The weather was its usual uncertain self, with rain and snow in the same day, with some cloud put in as well for the hell of it. The light in my room broke, well one of the bulbs and now I'm sitting in the semi-dark, which feels weird. I'm going to try and finish off a review of mine soon so I can get down to playing something decent.  Have a good weekend yourself, see you next week.
