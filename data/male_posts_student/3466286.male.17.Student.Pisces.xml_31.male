Also, just in case you were planning on comming here (The East Coast in general) at some point, the drivers suck.  All of them.  They can't even stay in the right goddamn lane.  apparently the lines here are suggestions.  Like all the other traffic laws.  Just so ya know.  Anywho,  urlLink this  is one of the best threads I've ever read.  Good reading for everyone, if you haven't already.  Possibly not Cheeseduck, as it has some drug and sexual references, but he closes his eyes for brief nudity in non-sexual movies.  Just read it.  Or I will find you.  None of you work, so it's moot, but possibly NSFW.  No images, just content.
