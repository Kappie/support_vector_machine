Chief Justice Roy Moore of Alabama's Supreme Court placed it there (I'm assuming that he had some help) a couple of years ago and now he is being ordered by a Federal court to remove it.  From a CNBC.com article entitled  urlLink Commandments debate spans nation  :   In Alabama this week, the drama could hardly be any greater if Moseshimself came down the stairs of the court building to argue over display of the Ten Commandments. Presence of the tablets in the judicial building has been championed by the state's chief justice, and shot down by all his colleagues, with protest gathering on both sides. But this case is only one of many battles waged in courthouses from Pennsylvania to Washington state. And despite appearances in Alabama, the verdict on the issue remains out.  The complaint is that the 10 C's represent or might be seen to represent the State's endorsement of one religion over another -- a no-no according to the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution. Or is it? The text says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."  Does the presence of this religious artifact in a "secular" court amount to Congress establishing an official religion? I don't personally think so. As long as the judge upholds the law, I don't see a problem with extra lawn ornaments on the grounds.
