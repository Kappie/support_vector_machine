A fire can always be spread--unless it collapses in on itself as soon as it sparks.    Same goes for politics.  Many great idealists with messages of great potential burned out before they could make their mark in the world.  This Weblog--"Blog"--is starting small. How much damage can a single Blog do? Not much.  How much damage can a Blog Network, with hundreds (or perhaps even thousands) of readers do? Quite a bit, possibly.  So, brothers and sisters of a great crusade, start small, with me, learning and practicing, and one day we will grow to be a great force of power
