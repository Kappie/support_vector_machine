Let's not discuss her beautiful voice, dancing skills and musical capacity for the present, her innocent and artless personality is attractive. There are many new singers in Taiwan, so I didn't notice her when she entered the show business in the beginning. But she really like the scattering splendor of the diamond. I am captivated by her characteristic now ^^". Hope she can work hard and don't forget the hard process of the beginning.  eVonne, cheerer!   urlLink    This is my favorite singger - eVonne. 她的名字叫做許慧欣,也許真的跟彗星一樣吧,一開始出現在歌壇中的她,真是馬上就讓人感受到她的那份親和力 不論是唱歌,舞蹈,音樂素養,最近更讓我感受到的是,她散發出來的天真和善,還有不斷進步的潛力 原本我不是很喜歡她的,以為不過是歌壇中又跑出來一位新歌手,不過... 現在我也被她深深吸引了,希望她別忘記辛苦起步的過去,也要繼續努力下去,發光發熱, eVonne 加油!
