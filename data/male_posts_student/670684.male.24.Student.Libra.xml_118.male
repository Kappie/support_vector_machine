I can put it on TriggerStreet.com, but you have to get a membership and all sorts of crap to be on there, and if you're not a screenwriter it's really a hassle.  We'll see.    Speaking of debate, here's a list of people I lost contact with that I would love to talk to again.  If you know the whereabouts of any of them, send 'em over here.  They'll be tickled delicious to see their name on an actual web site that isn't dealing with automotive reposession or sex offender registration.     Bennett Ryel .   Cameron Clausing .   Kenny Lowden .   Melia Woods .   JD Livergood .   Gina Brown .   CJ Davis .  Really, anyone I played soccer with between 1993 and 1997 (even Mark Henry, how's that lazy bastard doing?).   Maura Wilbur .   Lisa Thurber .   Nathan Hamilton .   Clint Bruce .   Vanessa Boyd .   Home Clothes Hughey .   Ross Butler .   Saghar Talebi .    This is a snapshot of my days of yore: playing Super Bomberman on the Super Nintendo, hitting Waffle House or Joe's between visits by the ambulance, watching cheap porno clips in seedy Arkansas motels, providing an homage to Zeb Maxwell Miller in the place Zeb would want us to...  There are lots more.  These will do for now.
