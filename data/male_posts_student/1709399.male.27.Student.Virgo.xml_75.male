Gurgaon is the Call Center Capital of the world and has plush malls  makes you wonder if you live in India . We went there late in the Night to take some Night shots with my new Camera of the Glitzy malls and active night life. It was quite cold and Venkat ( This Guy is one heck of a Driver , He drives Two wheeler like a F-1 Driver !!)  I travelled 120 kms(to  fro) on a two wheeler .  The photos have come out quite well although I still need to learn a lot on night photos.
