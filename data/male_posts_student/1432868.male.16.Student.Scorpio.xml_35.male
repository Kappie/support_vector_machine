You NEVER will get more then a 30% chance with a girl so don't even bother trying to be sure   3) The girl will almost never start the relationship. get yourself together and ASK HER OUT DUMBASS   4.>NO STALKING   5.> Try not to bother person when she is PMSing if possible (if she always seems to be that way, well then stay clear)   6.> Be mindfull of what former bf or attempted boyfriends have said about her. For example has she ever threatened to castrate them? IF Yes the run for your life!   7.> If she says no well your screwed so move on   8.> DO not delay!!!!! NOW or never   9.>If you have really fallen tha hopelessly in love well... your probablay screwed.     10.> Good Luck....Loser
