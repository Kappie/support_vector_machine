Im a student myself and i know that if i were the principal and knew this was going on, i would have definitely stopped it sooner. I know that that kid is probably sitting in the detention center thinking that his life is going to be ruined and he will never be able to move on, but i also know that after he has gone through this, his life will be changed forever and he will look at life in a different way... always. Hes going to learn to appreciate it more, hes going to miss his friends, hes going to go through more emotional rollercoasters than he can possibly imagine, but i know that in the end, after anyone has gone through something so severe, they will come out a better person no matter how much media attention he gets.
