We had dinner and then watched LotR:TT. And part way through, got tired and went to sleep. The next morning I slept really late, like till 12:30, from like 10ish at night, so that was fun. After that we were leaving for my Uncle Ralph’s new place; when we walked out the door there was this group of kids causing trouble in the street outside of one of Dody’s neighbors houses, and we were gonna wait until they had left to leave, cause my aunt is so consciences like that, and as the group of them drifted off and dwindled to three, she kept telling the rest of them to leave, but this one girl kept putting on this drama queen act where she pretended to be so upset and distressed, and she eventually hit the lady and my aunt ran into the street with her cellphone calling the police, we followed the kids in her car until they went down onto the railroad tracks, and disappeared. After that ordeal we went to Ralph’s and took a walk waiting for him to show up, then I played with my cousins and had dinner then we rented Master and Commander watched it, a good movie, even the second time around. The next day, would have been Sunday, we went to a British car show and it was cool, we took a walk on the beach, I got some cool-ish shots with my awesome new camera, and then we went back to his place, dropped off the cousins at their mothers, and we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, it sucked majorly, but I don’t want to talk about it. On Monday I went to work with Ralph for half the day, then I went with my second cousin and his grandmother, we went to a place to play put-put-golf at a place called “puts-up-dock”, you may laugh at its corniness now. Ok enough of that. But the place was closed, and we went to lunch instead, at a place called Ruby Tuesdays, I had a cheese burger and a chocolate tall cake which I couldn’t finish, its was really big. Then I met up with Dody, and we had dinner at a friend of hers, and it was fun. Then another friend of hers was staying over at her place in order to look for jobs in the area, and I had an interesting discussion with her, I can’t remember about what, but it was interesting. And then it was Tuesday and I left for work with Dody because that’s where Gary was to pick me up, so I hung out around Harvard Square for the day, had lunch with Dody and two of her friends who are about my age that I had met when I had gone up there before, and afterwards, I met up with Gary, we checked our bags in a hotel of the same chain of the one we were staying at in a suburb of Boston. We went out to some square in Boston and gad dinner at some place, I don’t remember where though, sorry, and after doing some other stuff, we got on the T and caught a ride to the end, and got cabs to our hotel and we went to sleep. Wednesday was kinda the first actual day of the trip with the group. We got up early and went to the UUA headquarters at 25 Beacon St. and took a tour of the place, it was really cool and I got some buttons out of the deal. After that we walked along the freedom trail for a while, and I was deeply impacted by the Holocaust monument that we went to, then we were to first group in all of the COA trips history that everyone had a raw oyster in, I personally had four. And to close the best day of the trip, we went to the blue man show. ITS WAS TOTAL FUCKING AWESOMENESS!!! I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn’t really lame. Possibly a review of it on Pie and Video games later, if Jesse wouldn’t be two offended by giving stuff away in a review, we shall see though. I bought the Rock Concert DVD, and the AUDIO CD, and got free band mints with my thirty dollar purchase, much coolness. And Dustin bought the spin painting, and also got mints, which is much cool-ness. thursday was fun, we went out to Walden pond and got baptized in one of the UU principles, i chose: "a free and responsible search for truth and meaning." i like that one the best. we also walked around in the rain, and then we went bowling, candlepin bowling, and Micelle got the most improved award, which is a thumbs up, or was it just the right to say that, i dont remember... and that was that day, i think, im gonna take a break now, and finish later. will update later.  Ok, its later.  So where did I leave off?  o yes, Walden, I realized that I forgot what happened in the interim, we went to this place, the something or other farms, and we had lunch, and then did some put-put, and I got the most improved score, cause I sucked majorly in the first round.  Ok then after that we ordered ice cream, and I was one of the only people who finished theirs, cause they were really large servings, and we also played some hackysack, and I really need to get better at that cause I kinda suck at it. Alright, then on Friday we went to tour the Arlington St Church, and it was really cool cause he liked our group and took us up too the bell tower, so that was really nice of him, cause he isn’t supposed to do that anymore.  Yeah, well then we had time to go off on our own, so we left each other in the Boston Commons and the groups split into their norms(Kara, Kaylin, Dustin, and Anthony and Michelle, Katie, Sean, and myself) the groups all had cell phones and everyone’s numbers so we were all fine.  It started off with us just walking around, and my group went to Faunal Hall area to eat, and from there we went to the Borders books that we understand was the “base of operations” for last years group, that we had been to before, and some of us bought some stuff, and others had already purchased things.  I called the other group, and they came to meet us at the Borders, and then we left, and Katie didn’t want to spend a day with Kara so we left them in front of us and Kaylin was running through traffic, and we all laughed at her but she eventually left with the rest of her group.  We then headed to the CVS to pick up some munchies for the night(you see, we did late night staying up, truth or dare, then fingers, and other get to know each other stuff like that, and we of course got hungry, so we got some food for that) and as we were walking out a weird lady came up to us and gave us a flower and told us she was getting money for orphans, and we gave her our change form the munchies, walked off, and then realized that we had been scammed.  We went back and lied that we needed the money for out T ride home, and some of the money was returned to us.  Then we went down to the last stop on the blue line “wonderland” cause Gary had been saying that there was something special about it, and we called him and asked what there was to do there, and he told us nothing.  Then we went back and called the other group who was apparently lost at Faunal Hall so we went to meet them and hung out for the rest of the day at the commons, after I used my l33t map skillz to find out where we were (and so no one gets to kick me in the balls, cause I said that if I couldn’t find our way to the park, and I did so no one gets to kick me in the balls, especially not Dustin!)  Ok so that was a really long day and the next was just as long seeming. You see on the Saturday we went to Harvard Square, which was a load of fun, we did a “scavenger hunt” to begin with and the team I was on (Michelle, Anthony, Kaylin, and me) got every single question right, cause we are just that awesome, and pathetic!!!!1 then we met up and took pictures of the statue, and then I went with Kara and Kaylin shopping cause I needed to be with some one to shop, and I really wanted to get the FFX lighter, and I did and I owe Dustin $20, but it was so worth it and its all mine, and its really cool!  Then we split into two groups, Gary leading Michelle, Katie, and myself and the rest of them in another.  My group went and toured the North end, and that was cool, and they went down by the shore to lounge around and we met up with them and played hackysac or a while and then we did some extreme frisbee, and my team won both times, so that was fun.  Kara picked up a guy and they “went for a walk” and disappeared for a while, im not sure what they really did and I don’t know if I want to know.  Yeah, then we went on a sunset cruise and chilled for a while, more hackysac was played, as well as cards, I did both a for a little, but what I like most about he trip was that I got some good pictures even if the subjects didn’t know they were being photographed.  But they really did look good.  We went out to Legal Seafood, I had some scallops, and we had some great conversations as well as a symphony of water glasses, if I you know what I mean, and if you don’t, then get out more.  So that night I was really freaking out at the T stop, I’m not sure why, but it happens every so often, and Shanna mad me go in the first cab, and then I walked around the open space in the middle for a while, then I went back, I was in the girls room for a while, until the rest of the folks came in and then I left cause it was getting to me too much.  I went to bed , but I wasn’t able to sleep and eventually got up just in time to vomit.  After that I really didn’t feel like sleeping especially caused my face felt all stretched out, and my capillaries were busted.  I woke up Katie and asked if people were still in there, and as it turns out they had moved and so I went to the other room, and then after about another half hour of watching TV, I threw up again in their sink, then I went to sleep again, and I did sleep, so it was all good. The next morning, we went to the service at the ASC(the church we toured earlier) and then we left again on the trip from Boston, and I ended up in VA, and they went back to Dallas. And now its all good and up to date, hope you enjoyed this, and per Jesse’s request I will do a “review” of he blueman show, but it may be more like a narrative, I don’t know.  But im gonna try and force my bro of the comp soon so that I can post this and talk with people, so bye, night, bed bugs, stuff, and all of that jazz... yeah, thats it so bye
