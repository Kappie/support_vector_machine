Why is doing the right thing harder than doing the wrong thing, most of the time anyway...  My parents are coming up to visit me again tomorrow, and bringing up the back of the chair which my dad conveniently forgot to bring last week, haha.... My new roommate should be coming soon. I hope he doesn't smoke, not in the room anyway, or else I'll have a bone to pick with him... I dont care if he smokes himself all the way to hell(I care about some people who smoke, not all of them) but I'm not going to be dragged down witth breathing in second-hand smoke.  Well. the actual reason why I decided to post about procrastination is because I find it extremely damaging... It has managed to get me up to my neck in backlog, which I might most conveniently suffer amnesia and forget about, or they may mysteriously get sucked into outer space, haha.
