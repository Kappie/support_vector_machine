Maybe seeing the moive will motovate some people to help improve conditions before they worsen.  However there will always be people who could care less about the future and do not desire to sell their gas guzzling polution contributing monster vehicles.  Any ways, think about the many ways we can individually contribute to improving our damaged environment and do one thing different for the sake of future generations.  PS: Thanks Thomas for changing the blogger set-up.  It makes it easier to see when I've posted because I forget between my other classes.
