And that's what's happening in this country right now.  Amen. Makes me want to act and prove that I'm not one of those people. I can't wait to go bumhunting tomorrow. It's a game that I've been wanting to play for a while: you find a homeless person, you treat them like a person, and you take them to lunch. That's it. It's a lot better than just throwing money at them, in my opinion. You know, a lot of people throw the line around that 'you shouldn't be judging me.' And it's true. I just wonder where judging ends and criticism begins. Criticism intended to move to action is wonderful if you ask me. Even sarcasm works in that context. Even heated ranting works ... like what I often do here. Sure, it's supposed to cut you - but it's more the kind of cut that makes you realize you already had a wound there. Then it's time to get out the bandaid. I don't think I'm judging when I generalize and make statements about 'Christians today.' I'm not accusing anyone specifically, I'm painting a picture and then attacking it. And it's all designed to spur on some kind of thought or reaction in the reader - biblically then, I think I'm within my rights. Now, if I named individuals and started condemning what they do and how wrong I think they are,  then  I'd probably be judging. But then, where does rebuking come in? Damn, there's a lot to explore on this subject. I think I'll break out the Bible on this one, because I need to study this further.
