I also have one invite left for anyone who's interested and is pure of heart :-P. My cousin took the liberty of giving himself an account after noticing that I had three invites. I gave him the password to TheGermic a while ago because he wouldn't stop naggin' about it and he was just so excited to see it. I just couldn't resist.  Moving on again, I stayed for a long time at the Steven's place, which is most of the reason for my not posting. While I was there, a lot happened. I beat all of the GDI and NOD missions of Tiberian Dawn, yes, the one for Windows 95. I also beat all of the Allied missions and every Soviet mission except the last one. Oh, and I also got half-way through the Allied campaign of Red Alert 2. Ah, and we can't forget about getting through half of Halo on Legendary with Peter. We spent a lot of time gaming, but it's not like that's all we did. Peter spent most of the time sleeping and eating because I was taking his computer. Poor guy, I feel bad now for what I did. I swear not to do it again, and as all readers of this as my witness, bla bla bla... or something like that. I forget how the rest of those types of things go. Anyway, we also played guitar for a bit, tabbed some songs, played Gravity Rides Everything a million times looped, and ya know, the usual.  Speaking of which, we got two new controllers for my x-box. I used to have two of the older bigger ones, but then we needed two more so we could have a halo party type-a thing with people. It's kinda hard to have a party with only two people at a time playing :-\. When I first got the controllers, I didn't think I'd like the smallness because I was so used to the big ones for over 2 years, but I got used to it pretty quickly and I really like it now. Just feels a lot more comfortable.  Lauren's party is tomorrow and I want to go. I have to call her tomorrow morning/afternoon to make sure that 1) it's still happening 2) What time it is, and 3) Where it is. There is this slight problem though, my mom isn't sure she can give me a ride and my dad is worried about the milage of the car, but knowing my life situation, things will go through pretty well. My life is easy, nothing bad really happens, and anything that does is just my looking at the situation in the wrong way. Ya gotta look at everything positively, as I like to think to myself when things start looking rough. I usually end up forgetting the bad things and feeling really spoiled and getting kinda depressed. Not having friends to help keep things in perspective doesn't help either, but there's gotta be a reason I don't have friends in the greater scheme of things ;-) ... ... ... :'(. Anyway, I hope I can go because it sounds like oh-so-much-fun and I just really want to go.  I've been talking to Kat online more often now ever since her online time has increased. It's always nice to talk to her, she's always so nice and has something interesting to talk about, or is open to listen to whatever stupid thing I have to say. Sigh. I like her even though I've never met her in person and have never even seen a picture of her. But wouldn't that then say that I really just like her personality and nothing more? I guess it would. There are a lot of nice people in the world, but few really ring with me. I think she's one of those people who can be a friend for a while. Then again, I've only known her for like 2 or 3 weeks via AIM. History on Kat: Peter went to school with her in CO. She likes to act and dance and sing. She's got brown hair and blue eyes and white skin. She's really nice :-).  Anyway, I think I've said all I need to say. If I have more to say, I'll just throw it in another post, I guess... That is all.         -- Feanor
