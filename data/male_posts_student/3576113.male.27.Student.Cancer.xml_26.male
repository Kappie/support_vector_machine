The hump that is the day of another year passing, is behind me. I'm reading again, which is good, has long been my second favourite thing next to road hockey. The Deed of Paksenarrion, book one, Sheepfarmer's Daughter is pretty good. Female soldier story, shades of Laurana one of my all time fav's. Burned both Bad(der) Santa and 50 1st Dates, so now I can see the Lil' Penguin whenever I like.
