Oh! I passed out today...it was...scary mostly...  I got up to ask my mommy a question, and I asked her, and she told me...but about halfway through her answer, I felt really dizzy and such...I said "What..."...then I kinda fell down and hit my head on the cupboard behind me (I'll have to take a picture some time to show you guys more effectively) and I sat there for a few seconds then got up. My mom was looking at me the whole time wondering what I was doing and then I came to and asked "What just happened"  My knuckles still hurt from falling on them...owies. Anyways, that's pretty much all that happened today. G'day all!   "Daphne: Fred, do you think that I'm just a pretty face?  Fred: No. I mean... yes. I mean *not fat*. Definitely *not fat*. Is this sort of you're looking for?  Daphne: Fat? Why did you even use that word?"   --Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed
