The reason, I thought was right, was good, was just beautiful to have. . . .   But along that path, through that tunnel, was an unseen trap. Even though at this very moment I can't stand my reasons for trying, still somewhat proud of doing so. I know you probably Do want to hate me, but similar to what you said, I don't care. I can barely care anymore, not just because you but from other things. I don't care at all if anyone can understand or not, I don't need anymore to understand it or me for that's just. . . .   . . . .There are Always those who won't even give a chance for consideration. Maybe I should become somewhat like them, for when I cared I was screamed at and slapped. . .  . . . .I fell into that trap. . . .Happy now? Are you content? Now it seems that you will be alone, just as you seem to desire. There is no more time for This, there is now but time for you and your thoughts. Hope you're happy. . .
