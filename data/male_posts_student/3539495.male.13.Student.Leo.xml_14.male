NO MORE MATH!!!!!!!!!!! yayayayayay! but you know, the substitues probably just going to go "well, lets take a look at the ap calculus book just for kicks. hey, this doesnt look to hard. 1-50 for homework tonight!". i completely screwered up my computer today. i was looking through it (i mean, inside the tower), and then when i turned it on, it just wouldn't load up. queer. so i just activated a system restore point and now everythings ok. wahaha. i know this is against my ethics, but the only show that i will ever watch that is exclusively owned by G4 is gphoria, and thats only because it has a lot of interviews with developers. all those other shows suck ass...  listening to: Smells Like Teen Spirit; Nirvana
