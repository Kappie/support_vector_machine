Then, once you get to know him, you realize he isn't stupid, he just lacks any form of common sense. Some of them are assholes though, but some of them are cool. In addition, I don't only care about what people think of me. Just because I don't go act like a jackass doesn't mean I only care about what people think of me. Plus, some of the juniors are cool. I don't see why you dislike them so much. And I never really got invited to go to the concert Friday so, why not go play XBOX with the juniors?  Tuesday: St. Cloud? I think we should definately go. Not only would it be the farthest driving trip for me (and Mattson???), but it would be fun. Plus, we will have just got paid by "Grandma." Who else can come?
