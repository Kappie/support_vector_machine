I wonder -ponders-  Well the weekend is almost over, like it always is...but it has been a rather good weekend for me (: happiness, yes, that's what I've had the past 2 days. I spent almost the whole day with  you  yesterday, i'm sure you know how much that means to me don't you? It hasn't been easy, it really isn't easy for the both of us, but we'll stand strong with my fingers interlocked with yours, no matter how cliched it sounds thats what we're gonna do -smiles- I want to face absolutely everything with you,   I don't wanna miss a thing  . We had a little session of tennis, i'm sorry for breaking out into laughter whenever you miss the ball, but you looked really cute then (: Then you snuggled close into my embrace while we watched "Love Actually", I guess, love is really all around and thats if only if we dare to open our eyes and look around for the people who make us happy. I miss  you  already, silly girl.  I caught the  Fireworks  earlier at the Waterfront, boy was it crowded but afterall, the fireworks was a pretty fine sight. I got some pictures but they were all badly taken, but beautiful things are more often kept hidden inside of us; memories. I met Xing, he was with momo his Indian friend who looked really cool, and three other girls including Rachel who was his Secondary school friend. Honestly, knowing both Xing and Amy, I've known so many other people. Riq, boy was it good to see you, but don't think yourself as a loner, I used to think of that and I did get used to being lonely, but things will change for the better, I hope.  Xing, thank you really, for being the bestest buddy in school for me, if it wasn't for you I do believe I would feel so out of place. Amy, you are one hella girl, my best buddy too (: but try to control your hormones, I believe you're turning into a guy if you hang out to much with the homies. Out of JAX, Xing, you have been the one who isn't ready to open up to us yet. Honestly, its something I would hope to change, both Amy and I saw how you left in a huff last Friday and yes it affected us more than I expected it to, I don't wanna see you give up, buck up brother. You know both Amy and I will be here for you. Amy, I know you're tired and how you've given up on certain things, but now just look at what is worth caring for and cherish it. Forget the unhappiness, its time for those things to stop. We all want to see you smile, you know that don't ya? -winks- Justin/Amylia/Xing BUDDIES ALWAYS :D -grins- This is a tribute.  Sky called me in the afternoon and told me he was depressed, its quite sad really, for me to realise the people I care about are bogged down by problems and more problems. One thing that really pushed me to think was what he said, "Bro, sometimes I really envy you, you always seem so happy." I did think about it, yes it is true, I am happy! I am so happy to announce to the world I am happy with being myself and having the people who make me happy stay around me. yes, I have realised that I want to stay around people who make me happy, whom I know I am able to make them happy as well, that I am someone in their lives, someone they appreciate. These are the people that recognise my existence, they are the people who keep me going. However, to Sky, I'm not someone who is always happy. I just make it a point to look on the brighter side of things, to think how to make the best out of things and not dwell on how I should have done this or should not have done that. There are times we will hurry back into our shells, just so people won't realise how insecure and vulnerable we actually are at that point of time, this is prolly the mask I used to talk about. Its human instinct really, as you grow older and experience the way people will react to things that happen. At the end of it, Yes, I am a happy 17-year-old right now.  I am contented with the lot I'm given. Yay! I talked to Gwen earlier on, boy do I miss her silly jokes -laughs-  You said,  "Silly. You are so silly. You make me love you so much."  But do you realise, that is exactly how I feel about you too -smiles- You make me love you, like its never to late to love a person with all his heart.    Our Ring.
