Perla had her baby and named it Ryan.  What a cute name!!!  So we were happy for her.  And then today Cachet and I went down to campus and checked out some hotties it is all we ever seem to do.  Shop, gossip and check out hotties.  I am hoping to talk to Michael later tonight tho so I hope all of you wish me luck.  I need it cuz as stated, I am a  little anxious to see what Michael says.  I am sure it will have something to do with our age.  But Cachet says honesty and at times brutal honesty is best.  So this is for you sha.  I am going with your advice.  However u know I am scared.  I keep seeming to freeze up whenever I talk to him.  This sure seems a lot easier said than done.  :-/
