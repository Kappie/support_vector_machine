Michael Moore did an awesome job putting it together, and it really makes you think why we're really in iraq. the bottom line is there really is no point: iraq never killed one american before we invaded their country, they supposedly "harbored" sadaam hussein and other terrorists, and thats why we went in there... thats bullshit. bush cannot get a grip of world issues and had no right to put troops into iraq for absolutely no benefit other than self-monetary improvment, as if he wasn't doing so great already. As it turns out, bush senior is very involved (and by involved i mean stockholder) in many companies involving u.s. participation in their government and economic policies. it seems that little bush junior caught on and decided to jump on the bandwagon. its clear to see that were in iraq for oil, and bush doesnt give a shit about much else.. wow, did i really just have the want to write all that down? that doesnt seem like my lazy-ass self.. meh, i guess you now know how i feel. earlier today i wrote that bush beats kerry anyday... im not so sure of that anymore.  also.. why cant people be civilized and the least bit respectful anymore.. sometimes they just dont understand. too bad you can't always say it'll be better tomorrow.  i guess thats all for tonight.. its 1 and ive got work tomorrow.. which brings up another point.. i hate my job and i want to kill myself while at it. if it wernt for (some) people i work with i would definately be done with that place.  goodnight funky-t
