After lunch today, actually suppose to go to school for the i room opening, but come to the end didn't went to school as i think stay at home and help will be better.  But after lunch, i slept till 4pm and after that went to take a shower, so refresh after that.        After taking a shower, went over to help out with my granny, she been complaining pain everywhere in her body, and it was really bad to see this happening to her.  She cried two time today and said that she is very useless and she wanted to die better than letting everyone suffering now.  After listening to it, the feeling was like.  Help her to exercise by moving her arm and leg, and ask her to do some neck thingy that i learn from the doctor last time.      okay, shall end here and do homework.  Hope tomorrow will be able to go out to eat tim sum.. See ya!
