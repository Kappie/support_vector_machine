I believe the Church has the most legitimacy amongst the other Christian faiths, which is why I choose be Catholic. When I say 'legitimacy', do not get defensive, for I do not believe that our 'faith' is more realistic than any other. Faith is simply that, faith. No faith is more or less valid than the next, it's simply a matter of your beliefs. I weigh Catholic legitimacy in the sense that we abide by some tradition, in fact, almost total tradition. There are over 3,500 Christian denominations in the US alone. The reason is not a matter of 'faith' per se. We all have faith in God, it is a matter of practice. 'I don't like that preacher', is all you need to split off and form a new church nowadays. Now, to many churches and christian denominations are fighting over the most moronic of things, the most insignificant of practices. Perhaps I am blind to truth, but it seems that modern day Christianity has inverted Christs' original message. To love.  Christ was a liberal, there is no doubt about it. The moral of Jesus' life was not about proper rites on the sabbath, or how much you put in the collection basket. It wasn't about praise and worship, or praying through saints. It wasn't about 'accepting him into your heart as your personal savior'. Those are all creations of men, and because of that, they are flawed and give rise to sin. The moral Jesus came to teach, was to love without ceasing. Be a good person. Clothe the naked, feed the hungry. Don't push a bible into someone's hands and tell them why they are cursed to hell if they don't read and believe. Amen I say to you, a bible forced down a man's throat shall not change them, but showing them the kindness spoken from within shall.   Most would call me atheist, or hethen because I do not subscribe to the orthodox belief that saying Christ's name grants entry into heaven. Indeed, it was said, 'no man may come unto the father unless it is through me'. I believe that to mean that Jesus came as a means of salvation for all, not those who learned about him in Sunday school when they were young.   Let me allude to the end of Matrix Revolutions for a moment. Neo struggled to stand on both feet in the pouring rain, Smith clones all around him. By this time, every side of the war was aimed on him. He was hated by the machines, by Smith (satan), and even by some of humanity (Jews), but in the end, he realized the choice he had to make. Sacrifice. Neo died not to save just humanity. Neo made himself the lamb of the passover to save all life, machine and flesh. Likewise, Jesus did not come to save the righteous, for they already were saved. Jesus came to save the lowly prostitue, or the foul tax collector.   It has been said that Jesus exists in all of us. Many a person attends 'cougars for Christ' at Tomball and expects to see Him most present there. Nay, I believe if you look at the hated, the despised of Tomball, you shall find Jesus. Outcast, abandoned, alone. I freely admit, I am in great fault. I have taken pleasure in hurting others. I am not inclusive. I hate many others. There are few redeeming qualities that I possess. I am just a voice crying out in the desert.    Make straight the way of the Lord...
