When thinking of the horror movies I have watched lately. I said to myself why would I want to watch a movie that would chill you to the bone and make you utterly afraid. Then the subject of horror movies strangely arose during diner. After sitting through a meal where everyone shared the horror movies they had seen it made me think even more.  The reason I would often watch a horror movie is to see what the outcome is like. How these characters will triumph over thier greatest fears. Everyone loves to see a hero but a hero in a horror movie is a different hero. Not a superhero, action hero, or some amazing guy off of the pages of some manga. But they are usually cast as a normal human with problems and difficulties and failures. Like all of us.  So now matter what we are dealing with we can get a little glimmer of hope that maybe one day things will be better. That one day the monsters in are lives will be over come. No matter how big or little the trials in your lives maybe one day they will end.  Psalm 23  Philippians 4:13  Lates,  Smog
