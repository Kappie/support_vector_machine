Trouble touching the computer whenever I want to write anything, because even though there are two of them, I never get the chance to use either.  Ive spent alot of time with Sammy lately and that has been a blast.  Enjoying the simple things of summer.  That and coming home to pass out after working all day.  TKD has been cut down, but I hope to pick that up in a bit.  Not much I can do with that, as its just getting harder to get there after work.  I mean, I get out at 630 when class starts, so I end up going late and I just dont get the workout I want.  Oh well.  Im rushing and drifting.  I need to realign.  Set my life on the center and work from there.  Stay with the present.  When I rush, bad things happen.  Right Sam?  hehe.  I still feel like a moron for that...  What it is, its so dumb, Im not saying.  Ok, well, off to enjoy another summer pleasure.  Gonna take Pips to the splash park that just opened up by my house.  Nothing fancy, just a good way to get wet and enjoy the afternoon.  Yup.
