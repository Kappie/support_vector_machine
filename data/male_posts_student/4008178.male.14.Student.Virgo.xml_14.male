Review of last night's "party"!   *ahem* ok first of all, whoever wrote down those instructions and directions on how to get the is like an idiot who shouldnt have been born (pablo?) i mean, a brick colored house with two palms on it? thats like so totally perfect, considering that every  goddamn house in the place was brick colored and had at least two goddamn palms on it.   Even if you DID follow the instructions, you would've ended like two blocks down the road, looking at the guardhouse. probably in the park with the rocks (park with rocks? wtf?). but i got there! after like 8 phone calls. xP but pablo is an idiot. its like "keep going! now turn to the left, turn to the left again, again, and turn to the left! youre there! (if you noticed, i just made a turn around the block) god!    So i was there in the terrace/livingroom/thing next to garden/bar and kinda bored. like, chris making out with manuel's sister (o.O) and blah. and everyone talking about how they wanted to beat gurdian and estebitan up. its like   pablo: "DID YOU HEAR?! i wanna kill gurdian! he's such a loser! i mean, he actually told me that i wasnt a true 07'er! can you believe it?!"  manuel: "DUDE! what an asshole! do you wanna beat him up?"  pablo: "yeah! thatll teach him!"  daniel: "When he comes, i join! and i wanna beat estebitan up!"   and hte convo goes on, but you get the idea.   but i mean, what the fuck, even chris got mad at me for saying "he's kida tright about it" and he like gave me a strange look and stuff. O.o;   so yeah, if any of you get into a fight, i get in, im not letting everyon beat you two up. (ill get my ass kicked too, but not so badly haha)    but the party was kinda boring. i mean, what the hell? i arrive there and people (drunk) start talking about my edge. what the fuck? and its all like: "what do your fist say?" "uh... drugfree" "WOW!" "uh.. yeah." and then they start talking to like each other, and these two "punk" kids (who seem like they just got out of the quiksilver store, with beanie and all) start talking to me about punk. O.o;   one word: i dont care! one more word: I cant count!   who the hell wants to talk about punk? its like:  kid: since when are you edge?  me: like 3 years ago.  kid: cool.  me: uh yeah.  kid: you like hardcore?  me: uhhunh. you?  kid: yeah..  me: like what bands?  kid: uh... crass and uh.. green day.  me: ok.  kid: you?  me: [dump bandlist here]  kid: oh. ive heard minor threat!  me: good. i uh.. gotta go.  [gurdian and estebitanarrives] ::relief::    and so when gurdian and estebitan arrived, i told them that ppl wanted to beat them up. and estebitan starts talking about it out loud. JESUS MAN, SHUT UP! i mean, you couldnt be inciting the fight even more XD   so we got bored of just standing around in there, and decided to go for a walk around the place. because.. uh... we dont really familiarize with most of the people there. at least not me.   so we sorta walked around.... late night... uhm, there was another party going on in one of the blocks in which people started whistling around at us. i hate people. lol. anyways, we kept on walking and heard some music on my radio then stopped at the park with the rocks and started talking about pr0n. yeah. kinda bored,eh? i also took a piss like a meter away from their faces. xD   i cant piss when people are watching me. its hard to.   at eleven i had to call my parents to tell them to pick me up at one because "the party was great and theres a lot of people" while gurdian made a body image of "youre talking crap" which sorta consited acting out crapping and hten taking the shit into your mouth and spilling it all over. yeah.   we came back into the party like at 11:20. bo-ring. a lot of people had come. well no. but anyways, we ate some cold hot dogs we found resting on the bar. wegulped them down with some water. yeah. then we like randomized and helped cleaning the place up. poor maid, everyone's an asshole.   but maybe ill rant about the maid some other day. and about the 07 generation. but someone else might wanna do it. what about you estebitan? im gonna get ready to leave now. be back in three days!    urlLink www.hotelpuntaislita.com  (thats where im going :O)     [edit] oh, to end last night's convo, if i found daniela on my bed with her legs spread open, i would pull her eyes out and fuck her eye socket. im a sick fuck, but daniela is a hpocrite [/edit]
