The mood has been set in the company because of this, and as you know, it is not a happy one. The depression is waving over each and every employee like wind over a field. Amazing how one mistake caused all of this. However, I diverge. You, Mr. Anderson, are no longer a valuable asset to this company. There is no redeeming your mistake. There is, however, something you can give us. Nay, you owe us. You no longer need it, so we ask that you sign the forms left on your desk to confirm the repossession of said object. All is not forgiven, or forgotten, but rather, all is lost. After this loss, the company may well go back to its state 20 years ago. You, a single man, an individual, has caused this. You, Mr. Anderson, are the reason and the purpose for this. You, Mr. Anderson, are no longer working here. We are revoking the funds from your previous paychecks, as well as your bank account, for the necessary repairs. We know you will have no objections to this. In fact, you are probably no longer at this location, having run like the coward you have proven yourself to be. You may be gone, but there is still plenty for us to take from you. Goodbye.
