It's convenient and sexy to call myself a writer...instant clout in circles outside of Austin, piqued attention from a smorgasboard of girls, handshakes and refilled beers from the guys.  If I told them that my current work was a weblog in the .net sphere, I'd lose the clout, the attention, and the beers.    Danny Ruiz says that if you want to be an artist, you have to work at it professionally for 10 years before you can call yourself one.  He hit that mark a few months ago.  I'm not even halfway there...it will be four years come August, when I wrote Tough Talk, a one-act for Centenary College Orientation, that deals with transitional issues from high school to college, and does its best work in providing no answers, trite or otherwise, to the basic dilemmas of personal freedom.    I look over my portfolio and see some success (Tough Talk, Lighting, Family Tradition), some failure (The Last Temptation by Christ,  urlLink Clubbing , Faith), and some work that can't yet be branded (Questions, Three Strikes).  Three Strikes is better than everything in my success portfolio, but I can't call it a success.    Do I live, or do I write?  In undergrad, I always told myself to live, and the writing would come later...thus the nostalgia/sentimentality factor.  Last year, I wrote more than I lived...at the least it was practice, and at the most I might have the beginnings of a saleable script.  But the key is to find the equilibrium, where I can live and I can write.    The other key is to see if I'm good enough.  I don't feel like I am.  That was bound to happen after Faith failed.  And I expected Faith to fail, in some ways.  But it floundered catastrophically.    Bob Foshko had an honest conversation with me in December about his life and his writing.   I got into teaching because I knew I couldn't handle my own scruitny...I wasn't a good enough writer for myself.   At the time, I assumed he wanted me to handle his suggestions and criticisms in a more positive manner, but now I wonder if it wasn't a foreshadowing for my own literary struggles.  No one in the class is tougher on themselves than I am.  I consider myself one of the top three writers in the class, but that means little because I am not a fan of my most recent work.  I'm not a fan of this blog entry.  I'm rarely a fan of the blog entries.  I usually write daily just for the practice, but recently I haven't stoked the effort as needed, and the result is three weeks of bland discourse, centered around me and the kids I look over at the TIP camps.  Some of it is time, as I must leave at present to attend to on-the-job matters.  But I could come back to this and polish it.  But I won't.    I'm 23, and I feel like I need a hit very soon.
