Yet another day spent at the park thinking,, i dont think anyone care about me,, my day is spent full of sadness, another sun set watched at the park and yet another horrible day goes by,,, so many things going thru my head its driving me crazy, so many thoughts, so many questions with no answers, why me?, why am i going thru this? why did my life have to change?,,,,,, i cant remember what happyness feels like.........
