The thing is, that when I try to write it it becomes unreadable, uncoherent and basically just a piss poor reading experience...  I tried three times already to write it down, but no dice. But I wanted to write something, so this is what I came up with... Pretty dull stuff, I know, but I had to write something!    Anywho, I took one of my weekly bicycle-trips this morning. I rided up the mountain we live by, and I was scared to pieces! It was so much traffic! Trailers(trucks?) riding both up and down,  and cars coming from both directions so i had to jump into the ditch and wait until they passed! It was terrifying! But the worst part was going back down, because I couldn't hear the car's that came from behind at all. After a while I got a lot of spit in my mouth, so I turned to spit it behind me, and there came a car in full speed! I'm not sure if I my spit hit it, but there was also coming cars  in front of me, so the car behind me screeched up on the side of me and barely made it past the other car's... It was not a particularly fun trip.    Well, I'm home now, safe and sound so I think I'm going to do something safe... like the dishes!    Peace out. Karsten     Song of the day: Amulet - Danger!
