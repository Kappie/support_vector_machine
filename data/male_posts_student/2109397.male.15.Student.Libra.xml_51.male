School is almost fucking over just like however many days we have is left.   This one kid I hate with passion, he thinks drugs are the way to get accepted by the people I guess he wants to be his friend or something. But anyways he thinks hes a dealer, always selling shit, ALWAYS trying to get money off of ANYONE and EVERYONE. He said one time that he would burn me a CD for 2 dollars when I have a fucking CD burner at my house. What a fucking dipshit. Every word that comes out of this kids mouth is either an excuse, a lie, or some stupid pointless crap. So anyways this kid thinks hes a dealer and he sux up to this one kid all the time and thinks he's like "in" with this kid. LOL was he wrong, I laughed everytime he said shit about this kid.  And today the guy he sux up to took a lot of weed off of him and didn't pay or nothin and it made me laugh, wut a little bitch lmao, he has no idea how many people want to kick his ass, he is the most dense piece of shit that has ever walked the Earth...lmao.
