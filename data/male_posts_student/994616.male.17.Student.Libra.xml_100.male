Especially when they think they are making a powerful statement (which is really just a cliche either being used perfectly, and subtly or completely incorrectly, for the sake of my amusement I have choosen the latter).  Side note 1; The reason some of my posts are decidedly vague like this one is because they relate to someone I believe may occasionaly read McThis.  Side note 2; I shall be posting on abbreviated schedual for the next week for reasons I prefer to not disclose, as they may harm the percieved integrity of the parties involved.
