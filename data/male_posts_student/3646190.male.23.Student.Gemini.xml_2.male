At the same time, the American public is only ready for so much.  And Moore's stated goal is to ensure that Bush does not get a second term in office.  His film (hopefully) works well to that end.    I thought the most powerful part of the film was the sequence with the recruiting officers in Flint.  What assholes!  I remember getting call after call in high school from jerks like that who tried to pretend like they had my best interest in their mind.  Bullshit.  The movie should be seen for that sequence alone.
