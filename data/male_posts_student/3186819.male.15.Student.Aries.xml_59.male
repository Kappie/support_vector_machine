For instance, last weekend we went to garage sales and I got a fax machine. However, when I got home a huge area of copying was whited out. I figured the scanner inside was busted, and was prepared to keep it as a telephone but its faxing capabilities were nill. But then, I opened it and saw a multitude of dirt and sticky grime near the scanner. I cleaned that but nothing. So I left it for a while. Then I opened it up about a week later and decided to clean very well down where the scanner was. I did so and low and behold it works! Cleaning solves many problems, people! Learn that. So if something doesn't work, try cleaning it!
