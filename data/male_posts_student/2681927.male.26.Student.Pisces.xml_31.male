But England came back strong, playing an attacking game and scored twice late in the first half. The second half was like the first, England held onto the ball and Croatia tried to counterattack.  My Man of the Match: Wayne Rooney.  Sad to say, later that night,  urlLink an English fan got stabbed and died .   urlLink Switzerland - France 1 - 3
