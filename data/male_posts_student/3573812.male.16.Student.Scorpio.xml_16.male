I haven't started reading it yet but I assume it'll be great because the first two ('Across the Nightingale Floor' and 'Grass for His Pillow') were + this is on the 'Guaranteed Great Reads' list.  While I was at Chartwell I decided to go into  urlLink Sounds  to look around and ended up buying 'Showbiz', the first album by  urlLink Muse .  I haven't decided whether I like it or not yet.  Their lastest album 'Absolution' is brilliant.  In 'Showbiz' Matt (vocals + guitar) sings just a tad too high and it sounds kinda painful.  Anyway I've gotta leave for work.  Crap I'm gonna be late!
