Got Project Management Classes tonight, submitting the risk analysis, lets hope that the project leader has been able to print the document out or otherwise we'll be in deep excriment ;-)  Just gradually checking through the posts from alt.politics.homosexuality on groups.google.com and it is funny to see the number of, well, "confused" persons out there who still think being gay is a choice.  Then, what do I expect when a post spans accross the religious nut groups which brings in every crucifix waving, bible thumping, "praise the lard!" screaming persons to throw their 5cents worth into the discussion.
