Its a return ticket and I may ( dunno I’m not sure of coming back) return on the 11th of October. Still miss her a lot . I haven’t heard form her in almost 2 weeks. I guess she’s happy. AS the saying goes "No news is good news".... I always have this fear "that no news means that some one out there is dead"... that’s just me.  Slowly inching my way towards finishing my dissertation, I’ve been slacking a lot lately... at least there are no problems at home. (Amen to that) I've been speaking  a lot to god, dunno if he ever listens ( i guess u start speaking to god when u are at the verge of giving up on life, hoping that he'd show you the way)  Speaking of home, where exactly is home? I never felt secure within the four walls of my parent’s home, never felt secure at this place where I am in.... Where is home? Isn’t a place where you are to feel secure? Where u can go back and rest your weary bones after a hard day? I wonder where my homes gonna be?  Watched a movie where Christopher reeve plays a paralyzed cop. It was nice movie, but I had this feeling that I had seen it before, because I knew how it was gonna end.  Wonder if my sister thinks of me? Rema doesn’t really care how. Damn I’ll have to meet her if I land in Bombay and listen to all the stuff she’s gonna tell me(oh yeah and wash the vessels when I’m done.. like she once said there’s no such thing as a free meal  ) I like her, but she gets on my nerves. I’m looking forward to see Dave and Aroo.
