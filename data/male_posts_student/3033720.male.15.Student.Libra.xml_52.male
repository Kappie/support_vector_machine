Real nice people. Anyhow, this really big girl's dad wrote her phone number on a menu for me today. Man it was awkward. Other than that, not much is going on. I'm supposed to go to Splash Country tomorrow but I can't get through to anyone to find out when and where we meet. I am going to be really pissed if this doesn't work out. Someone better call me with the info   tonight  . You can tell by how I put that in bold  and  italics that I'm damn serious. That's it for now. I'm out.
