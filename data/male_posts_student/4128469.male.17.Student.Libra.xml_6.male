Every other year i haven't really bothered that much about these, and i wasn't this year either really til my comrade came out with his dramatic monologue and it makes you realise I am up shit creak without the luxury of a paddle that young Michael has at his disposal. It's my own fault if I had been hardcore and no picked stuff based on Mr Brown and his crap jokes i would already be in Uni. But i need 4 B's and as Graeme Spieres said tonight, "I have quite a few hats and if that happens I'll eat them all" I think i was doin alrite in chemistry no done it for a year and that so i suppose i'd be aiming for a c might have failed it though the exam was quite hard if i remember right. But i got predicted at an a/b so at least Macca has faith. I've already failed geography once but thats more to do wae the fact its boring than hard. Last year I didny do anything just put comrade McAllister aff and talked pish I think i should get a c though. Craft we had a prick for, I'm no taking the blame, I had all the lingo in the book anthropometrics, aesthetical, hand-bastard i knew it all but half way through the year an invigilator came in and told us our projects aw wanked dugs and McIlvanney's answer is some guys will say, that wit a prick. I think i might have got a c though for the lingo alone, English wis a big bastard my task wasn't helped when i got sat beside Tashleigh amidst speaches about you might marry who you get sat beside in higher english. Scary. aye so I don't know thats where the great gatsby comes in. I don't know.... probably a c/fail cos my 2nd essay was pish and no finished. So in conclusion BCCC or CFFF. And also good luck to my comrades Downey who needs BBC I think, we have faith in the man and Cheesy who needs nothing but he's bricking it and also the likes of Lisa who is also in but is also bricking it. And may i also say i sincerely hope that poofy prick Mullarkey fails. And also good luck to lesser known comrades such as young Samantha-Jo and my ex compatriot known to you as dicky breath and people from her school who are okay. The rest can fail like me ahahaha.
