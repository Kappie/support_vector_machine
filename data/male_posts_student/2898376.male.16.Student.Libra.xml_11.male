Good Deaths, Bad Deaths Good Deaths   Being the last survivor of your generation, so when researchers come to talk to you, you just make up a lot of stupid facts and cause all subsequent history books to be wrong.  “And remember - there's a fortune hidden in the old hmlmblrmblmrrrghh.”  Taking everyone in this damn office with you in a massive, fiery explosion a split-second after they stare into your whooping face in terrible realisation.  Falling into a black hole which crushes you to a near-singularity, so that you have to be buried in an incredibly tiny coffin that still takes six struggling pallbearers to lift.  "Checkmate, I think, Colonel."  Dying in such a way that you're remembered as part of an acronym.  A string of ever more impressive blazes of glory.  Riding a nuclear bomb into Exmouth.  Secretly replacing your skeleton and organs with fireworks, opium, magnesium blocks, 245-trioxin, etc., and leaving strict instructions to be cremated.  Reappearing a good 45 minutes after you'd been left for dead and saving the day by calmly and with great precision piloting your hot-air balloon over the rocket silo, holding yourself erect and shielding your eyes wistfully from the dazzlingly glorious rising sun as blood trickles down your gripping knuckles over the weave of the basket, and grey-jumpsuited minions run around sharp and angular corridors in panic and the foaming mastermind tries to stop the automated launch sequence, and the brass section sweeps in on the soundtrack.   Bad Deaths   Being crushed by a bookcase, and some of the books fall open to reveal hidden pornography magazines, which you had no idea existed and were actually left there by the previous tenant.  Turning inside-out after a madman has secretly turbo-charged one of those little mouth Hoovers they use to suck spit out of your mouth at the dentist's.  "That's just what he'd want us to think, so it must be the blue wire!"  Mixing up the envelopes so your henchman gets a letter full of news about the children, while Aunt Eunice is ordered to kill Bunky Charley, which she does, except, mixing up the nicknames, she goes for a waiter named Charles at your favourite restaurant, and he steps aside at the critical moment to adjust a candle, so the poisoned dart hits you by mistake.  Misguided relatives paying to ensure that your memory is keep alive in the form of a bench.  Being the first person ripped apart in flames by a marauding alien, just so everyone realises the situation is serious.  Anything involving a loss of trousers.  Becoming involved in an elaborate kidnap plot which ends with you trapped in a bare cell in a subterranean headquarters, and you say, "Well, that's one thing - they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to bring us here just to kill us," but they have, and someone walks in and shoots you in the back of the head.  Mistaking World o' Orphans for the runway.  "Tis a better, better far thing I... CHRIST'S DAMNATION!"  Using perfect timing based on the ever-diminishing gaps between floor indicator lights in a plummeting lift to spring impact-reversingly into the air at the precise moment you hit the bottom of the shaft then, just as your hair lightly brushes the emergency trapdoor at the apex of your leap, having your head dashed from your shoulders by the sizzling electrical motor which crashes down through the roof.  Being given a new identity by the government, then beaten to death in mistake for someone else.  Curiosity about tolerance levels.
