You would too after having to serve it for over five straight hours to helicopter pilots, ambulance drivers, policemen, and members of nationally accredited search-and-rescue squadrons because a staff member got lost in the woods with a (female) camper.  They were found at 5:40 A.M.  I didn't sleep.  On a different note, I changed job positions at camp.  I used to work at Dan Beard; now, I am the dining hall steward.  Squeak, who held the job previously, had to leave for a NOAC conference in Ohio.  I bought two CDs.  I'll review them in the future.  For now, I leave you with some thoughts.  When exactly does late end and early begin?  Winston Churchill is accredited for saying "Never, never, never give up."  Does the public really think he was the first person to say this?
