The Kingpins of some of the large producers of videogames watch numbers, they like numbers, if they see a game with high numbers, they see what they did that was so grand and they duplicate it, in a slightly different manor. This is where the problem comes in.  Grand Theft Auto 3, innocent enough, no? Well, it isn't so nice when every single promising game coming out on the market is a rag-tag spin off of the go any where do anything, steal cars. shoot people genre. "What's so bad about this?" you may ask, well, first of all, I'm not even a fan of the series, sure at first I admired there ingenuity and there break through gameplay, but now, it's a kick in the face. Take Jak and Daxter for example, that game was as far from GTA as Canada to the moon. With the unfortunate release of 'Jak 2' it has become just another of the lowly peas in GTA's pod. I say we give the fat cats a message and tell them to take their numbers and flush 'em. You killed Jak and Daxter and put a permanent scar on the Videogame industry!   + Jak and Daxter +  (That would be an e-shrine lamenting their passing.)
