I rem when i was in sec sch,i dressed in atraditional malay costume (borrowed from my dad's malay colleague), during racial harmony day.But the school i teach in did not ask the students to wear any traditional costumes, instead they organised games in the hall...       Asking non-chinese to sing Kit Chan's Jia        Asking non-indians to do Teh Tarik    Haha, at first when they demonstrate how to sing Jia, all the kids in the school sang, it was a warm and cosyfeeling.. Ohhhhh...   Treat Every Race Equally      Current Mood: Patriotic  Current Music: Wang Wang Pao Pao Guo Dong Zhen De Hui Sheng Qi (from TV)
