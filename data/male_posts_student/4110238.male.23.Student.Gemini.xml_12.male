Or how to read things more carefully. So you can look forward to pics and thrilling Allyn stories tomorrow, instead of tonight. How I made that mistake is totally beyond me, but around 6:30 I had to call Allyn and say, hey remember that message I left you earlier about seeing you tonight, yeah well I actually meant tomorrow, since, you know, that's when the concert is actually taking place and you will actually be in town. Damn.  Otherwise tonight was great: I had a good talk with  urlLink Braden  on the phone, then went to dinner at Jamie & Priya's and got to tell Amanda the big news (pencil in hand, of course). It was exciting, and not at all stressful, mostly because I trust Amanda and knew that she would be very accepting. Today's big lesson: I need to be more s-o-c-i-a-l. Say it with me kids!  Today's blog was brought to you by the letter S. And freshly sharpened pencils.
