Of course the fact that I wake up at 5:50 (this is AM before the sun comes up, don't be mistaken) every day really sux balls, but there have been other things that make up for this horrible task. First of all, we don't have school for two weeks. Second of all, I love girls. I love their smell, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they try to be funny, the way they kiss, EVERYTHING! In all my years, I have never been able to just hangout with a girl and enjoy being there. It doesn't even have to be just me and the certain girl. This certain girl's father can be sleeping on the couch next to me, staring at her daughter holding some kids hand(mine), and I'm still having a good time. The reason for my enjoyment is that I'm there with the girl. Nothing else matters. I sound like an idiot. lol.  Bigah! Slap me. I can't wait for New Years.
