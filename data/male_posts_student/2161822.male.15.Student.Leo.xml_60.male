So this week is going to be hectic since I procrastinated working on PJAS until now. Such a shame I have to do it. Oh well. John Petrucci rules. So anyway. I really need ideas for sections on my website. If you haven't checked it out, go  urlLink here . Or maybe just save yourself alot of time and don't go to the site since it sucks anyway. But hey I tried. I've been keeping myself busy in these cold winter days by playing guitar and writing tabs. So if anyone wants a song tabbed out for guitar or bass, let me know. E-mail me or IM me. (jonp3313 or VaLo138) Just don't request a song like any by Dream Theatre or Black Sabbath. I'm not all that good, so leave the solos to a 20 second minimum. Wow I wish I could play a Petrucci solo. That would be awesome. But for now I'll keep practicing. Maybe I'll get good in 10 years. Naw.  Listen to H.I.M.
