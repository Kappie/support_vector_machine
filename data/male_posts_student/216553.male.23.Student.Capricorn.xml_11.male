Apparently, there's another several thousand to go at this point!  I also just got back from dinner at Pimo's with Haran and Sadis.  We've pretty much been chilling all day, and  we're already dreading school tomorrow.  Only 2.5 months left for the semester, and 5 sets of block exams to go!  Ok, that's it for now. Bye bye.
