This way they have a second house that they can make money off of and I can still have a house (I hate paying property organizations like Paradigm).  Of course they just hated this idea, assuming I was trying to pull something over on them (as if) and since I didn't feel like going through the paperwork of getting another house until I figure out where I want to live, I just submitted and rented out this apartment.  Now fast forward to June 27. My mother calls me and we're talking about her trip this week. She's going to be seeing some old friends, one of whom owns four houses in the Charlotte, N.C. area. They rent three of them out to their kids and just bought a fourth for themselves. Of course they've retired early and make great money off the interest rates of the homes while charging their kids pretty minimal rent to stay there. The thinking is that they can help their kids save up and buy houses of their own.  Now all of a sudden my parents think this is a WONDERFUL idea. Just brilliant. They were asleep when I sold my condo and suggested this idea but now thou art awaken.   Sounds all good but I've got six months on my current lease and I'm stuck, plus there's no guarantee I'll want to live here when it's up. So now they want to do this thing fairly quickly (they are impatient/impulsive like that) and I'm stuck in rental hell. I'm so angry I can't even give them a shit-eating "I told you so" grin.   So there are two options: either a) beg and plead the properties company to let me out of my lease (HA!) or b) Wait and see. The hope is I'll know whether I'm staying here or moving elsewhere by October and we can search for a place. The only saving grace could be if I get this particular job and I'll be forced to move somewhere in between Jacksonville and Atlanta. That could at least solve my lease problems because the paper will just give me the money to buy it out or take over the last six months and put an intern there or something.  Anyway...Parents are frustrating.
