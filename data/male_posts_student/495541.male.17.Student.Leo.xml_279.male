Cool.  michael.halbe@gmail.com  On to the update:  My sister got married today.  Other than that, it was a pretty mellow day.  I can't say it was all that exciting.  It's nice to have all the family out here, but I don't know exactly why I'm so out of it this week.  I haven't really had a day that I can do nothing.  I need to sleep.
