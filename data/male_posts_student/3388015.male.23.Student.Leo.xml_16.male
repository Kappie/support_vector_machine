I've got a bit of work before I can do that, but that's not too bad.  We also walked around and met some horses, including one that was extremely thin and sick.  Cindy liked that one a lot and would adopt it for sure if she could.  However, her dorm room is a bit small.   urlLink     After explaining the finer points of egg differences and pot belly pig intelligence, we moved on to Golden Port.  We had a great meal, including some samples of some "extra" food that Wayne had in the back.  We went back to Cindy's room and moved some more of her stuff.  I swear, for someone that has so little, she has a ton of stuff.  And its heavy!  After moving it up 16 floors in Burton, I returned home to an anxiously waiting Jake.  After cleaning my room, eating a little dinner and running a couple errands, we went outside and took some pictures of his tires (he needed them to get feedback from car people on the internet).   urlLink     It started to rain and a thunder and lightning storm hit quickly.  Meanwhile, we started playing Champions of Norath, a game that is taking us forever to finish.  It's like a 100 hour game and we're only on hour 12.  However, I got some laundry done.  I finally found my cell phone, it was hidden in the recliner.  Amazing how fun my life was this weekend, huh?
