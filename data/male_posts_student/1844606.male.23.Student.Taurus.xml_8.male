In the interest of disclosure, I do in fact own their first cd and did enjoy it for some time, until radio played the hell out of it.  Anyways, my point.  I read this:  www.vh1.com/news/articles/1477670/20030826/index.jhtml?headlines=true  And this quote catches my eye.  "I don't want my record to sound like a demo," Strokes singer Julian Casablancas says. "I mean, I like the demo, I like the vibe and all, but it's [been] done."   Silly me, I thought the first album was a demo, cause it sure as hell didn't sound produced.
