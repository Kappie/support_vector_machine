But seriously, this is an outrageous satire that begins where the Evil Dead movies left off. It is a must see with a ton of one liners, which, unfortunately, you had to see the movie to really get. It plays of every major cliche for the whole action genre (and some terror cliches too). This movie is too good for the normal ratings system, so it gets, like 14 stars. Just go out and see it now (make sure to watch itwith friends, because watching with a group of comrads makes it much funnier.    ************
