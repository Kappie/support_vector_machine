I didn't think it was confusing at all. There are little things that I had questions about, but they're minor sci-fi nerd questions. It was basically the all so common sci-fi question about destiny... are you meant to do what you're doing? or do you have choice? It's like the paradox of time travel. Are events of the present a result of you going back and making it happen? or would it have been different? It's kind of existential. Exactly how do you live your life? I read Sartre's "No Exit" today and it addresses some of those issues. Is existence being able to make choices or not? Of course for Sartre it's making choices. Then again there's the ever so famous Marx quote that "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please."  As Sartre says... "Tu n'es rien d'autre que ta vie" - - "You are nothing but your life." As Merovingian says... "It's like like wiping your ass with silk" in regards to speaking in French.  ****
