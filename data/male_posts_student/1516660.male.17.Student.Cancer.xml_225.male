It gets too sweet after a few gulps. HaHa. What a wonderful experience.   Hmm...today morning was spent in boredom again. Eat, go online....HaHa.   In the afternoon, I went to play bball with the usual gang again. HaHa. The weather is so strange. The sun is so shiny...yet there's rain. Rain for a few minutes, then stop. Strange weather cats! Our Earth is self-destructing!! (Stop jumping to mad conclusions, KY!!) We waited for XC...then went to another court. The court we were eyeing is full of chao Ah Lians (and Bengs) and idiotic cats who everytime ask people to match against them (like we are so free!!) and later siam people out of the court (terrible! they must be murdered!).  HaHa. I noticed something shocking. (Cannot say ar!!! Or else, I would incur the wrath of this cat) HaHa! I can tell you ar, it's very the shocking lor! HaHa. I told Ah Ji what I noticed, he don't believe me at first. After witnessing it, he was also very surprised! HaHa! Such a surprise...I refused to believe my eyes at first, but after making multiple checks, the truth was confirmed. Xiao shu lin wor!! HAHA!  HaHa. we played at the court where there's absolutely no shade. HaHa. The sun was so overbearing. HaHa. We took two breaks. HuiMin, Joyce and Gao Luan joined us later in the game. HAHA. During the game, I caused delibearte annoyance towards WQ (thwarting his scheme, hitting him, taking his ball..muhahaha). He tried to annoy me using the same way (what else? caused me bodily damage la). Ha! Revengeful fool. Like I am gonna stop 'annoying'. You know me better than that. Ha!  HaHa. Two girls joined us, wanting to make a 6vs6 game. They were quite small la. HaHa. Gloria said don't underestimate them because of their size. She's right. The smallest girl ended up on my team, and boy, she sure is powerful. Cool moves man! Like a pro. I wondered from whom did she learn from. Her old brother? Her father? (Such curiosity). We played till 5 something.  HaHa. I came back and sorted through my presents. I left them all lying around. HaHa. My mom said she would throw everything away tomorrow if I don't sort out my presents. HaHa. I put them all in their rightful place. O.o!   HaHa. Hmm.....tomorrow I must tune in to Perfect 10's Top 100 Countdown. From 12 noon to 10pm. Ahh! I must listen to which song got top! This should be interesting! HaHa...  Ah well. I think I am stopping here le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
