We picked up Tony at 8:05 when Derek said we'd get him at 8:30...and he woke up right when we got there so...yeah. Anyways, we stopped at Burger King so they could grab some food and..we were off to Cleveland! Anyways, the concert was great, I saw a lot of bands I've been wanting to see live for quite some time..Only thing that annoyed me was..      1) Someone threw an open and full (but plastic) beer bottle and it hit me in the back of the head, pouring beer all over the back of my head.      2)  As Coheed  Cambria were finishing their set, I was ducking because a crowd surfer landed on top of me and right as they passed the drummer threw his sticks into the crowd. Well, of course he had to throw them at the only person NOT looking up, so they both hit me in the head and..it hurt.      3) As Bad Religion started their set, a girl next to me in the front row was trying to get out by jumping over the barrier with help of the peacekeeper...Well, behind us was some stupid (probably a drunk Nazi) pushing everyone to get closer. I turned to him and said, "She's just trying to get out." And of course that's the most rude and offensive thing anyone could've said, so he responded with, "I'll fuck you up!" I looked at him and just said, "Whatever.." So when I turned around he punched me in the back of the head. Funny thing was that it didn't hurt at all, so I turned around and looked at him again and said, "You've got to be joking me!" Then I just rolled my eyes at him and turned around again...so he punched me two more times...it was pretty funny because he looked like he could break someone, but he couldn't even punch me hard enough to hurt..      So yeah, yesterday was intense..I was so happy to see Bad Religion, Alkaline Trio and Flogging Molly...oh, and of course the Casualties! Today I have small abrasions on my back and my ribs hurt from being pushed into the metal bar in the front row...oh well. Good day.      Anyways, Derek dropped me off first, I walk the stairs and first thing my mom says was, "Ian, nanny died about an hour and a half ago." Freaking great...awesome day, then that news. She was obviously sad and crying so I comforted her for a half hour or so and then did my thang...ie. bathe.      It's alright that she's not with us though, in fact she's been in pain for quite some time and it was better for her just to go, especially in the presence of so many people that cared for her. I loved her so much, what a great lady...she was truly blessed, and we were truly blessed to have her. I know she's now with her family that preceded her in death so, everything is alright. Thanks for everyone who's shown concern and/or offered your prayers...thanks.         Rest in peace grandma, you're safe now.
