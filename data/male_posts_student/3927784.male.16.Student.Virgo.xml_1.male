I think thats more sensible and puts less pressure on the old noggin.   Ok, well i didnt write this yesterday like i usually do before the day i post them, so i'm in a hurry to think of something and then type it out. So Saturday was the last time i write anything so i cant remember what i promised. I can remember saying that i'll do 8 and 7 for my top ten irritating things, but i get the feeling i'm forgetting something.    So, what other news do i have for you today....nothing.....moving on.........    Heres the 8th and 7thirritating things:     8) Planning to sleep in late and getting woke up early:  I hate it when this happens because the college weeks finished and all you want to do is catch up on sleep. So when you get woken up a couple of hours after you get up for college, your bound to be pissed off and tired. If i get notified that i have to get up early, then i'm usually ok and i've got the sunday morning to sleep. But when it happens ON a sunday, theres no chance of another lie in because its back to college the next day.     7) Childish people:  Theres a difference between having fun and acting childish, and some people need to realise this. I wont go toomuch into detail on this because i've talked about it in one of my previous blogs but when your 16/17 and you act like your 5, then you need to realise you have to grow up. But like i said, theres a difference between having fun and acting childish. Yeah you might think that throwing chips is fun, but you need you need to think what others think when their watching you.    Anyway, i'm gonna leave it there and work on Fridays blog, so i'll see you then folks!   -Peace-
