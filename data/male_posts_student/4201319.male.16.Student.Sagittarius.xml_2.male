What is their line of thought? I honestly have no idea. for instance yesterday I clicked on this astrological site,about health or something.And the site was blocked under the catagory of being "Non-Traditional Religions and Occult and Folklore". well of course its not part of our religion, and we all know its just crap..but say for instances I had a report or was doing research on something such as ancient chinese customs or indian history,etc.(anything along these line) well wouldnt these topics and all sites relating to them be under this catagory?If so then the purpose of the Internet or "Global Village" as a means of sharing Information throughout the world is lost and obsolete..I'd have better luck just trying to look up stuff in encyclopedias at libaries.   Which brings up another problem in the structure or sensibility of the set-up of our resources. Because there are no public libraies for me to continue my research in.which in retaliation hinders my academic acheivements.so wats the point of doing work that is uncompleteable. But now dont get me wrong Its not that I resent the country.I critical in order to point out the faults and hope that they'll change for the best.I hate these topics its soo depressing:(  well ill just talk about myself for awhile, there isnt to much to say.I cant tell who i am..To know someone you have to meet and experiance the atmosphere or aura they project..but basically Im the kinda guy to do wat eva is possible and whoevers' avaible..I'm devoted to people and their cause even if it aint mine..I like doing things that'll make someone else happy..I cant stand not seeing people and feel like i done a wrong if I dont have a tons of friends around when doing an outing... yall are probally sick of reading this crap,If you've read this far your probally really bored... well ima stop here..thanks for reading...I'd appreciate yalls comments..it'll give me a direction to talk about,,thanks again
