My writing has been different too.  In the beginning, i eas more giddy and shit, now it's a much more serious tone.  lol, i acutally can't believe i wrote half the shit there, but out of all of them, my favorite entry has to be from 4/4/2004.  It just brought the most momories back, plus i think it's the longest entry i ever typed out.    but anyway, just had to mention that.  hmm, should i describe what i did yesterday? lol, lemme make a quick list:  bowling  jeane and dan LOTS of fun gonzo is the man splits i can't bowl for shit drag racing car sucks  the end   lol, and there u have it.  I'm acutally to tired right now to type the whole thign out, so maybe next time.  Acutally, if anyone is reading this, and see's me in person, just ask if you really wanna know that bad.    During bowling, John mention Jen. It was wierd to hear cause i haven't spoken with her in so long.  Well, maybe it's just me or something.  I dunno.  Yesterday was just kinda wierd overall, but TON'S-O-FUN. Me, John, and Gonzo were the bachelors of the night, and jorge was honerary.  lol, all this talk about girls is reminding me of that antioch joke thing i pulled, and the reactions.  In the entry after it, caroline mentions that she still thinks it's farah, or lilia.  Well, she was right about lilia, but it's just a recent thing, not anything i've been dreaming about since march, juss letting that be known.  Tonight at antioch is Christine's last talk at antioch.  I personally don't know christine very well, but she's very nice, and obviously very smart if she's heading to Harvard for College.  Speaking of college, i think i'm gonna chill with the major hunting for now.  I got a year left before i head out, a year to try out alot of differnet things, so for now, i'm just gonna stick my foot in everything, and see what i like more.  well, i'm tired now, so let's see what happens  bye bye now      lol
