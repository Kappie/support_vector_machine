This morning, I got an e-mail from one of my professors, forwarding an e-mail from that same organization, seeing if any student groups might be interested in having the author speak to them.  So clearly these people are really trying to create buzz or get publicity or whatever.  I'm still not telling you the name of the book.  :)
