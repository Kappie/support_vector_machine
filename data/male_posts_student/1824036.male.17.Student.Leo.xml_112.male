I loved it so much that a little over a week later I went out and bought the second Lord of the Rings movie:  urlLink The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Special Extended Edition) . And now I sit here waiting for 8 days until the third Lord of the Rings movie:  urlLink The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King  comes out! I hope it wins some Oscars :) and I hope it puts a GOOD end to the trilogy!!!
