 Mike helped me set up a dynamic flash photo gallery.  It's incredible what a little programming can do.  More impressive though is how the new gallery makes it fun to view photos.  Once the initial technical barriers are overcome, the maintaining is quite easy and indeed fun.  Perhaps this type of elegant simplicity is the same paradigm Apple follows.
