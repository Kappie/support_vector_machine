Caller: Well could you tell Stephen Pearson that he needs to come in about his contact lenses Me:  *ooh thats me*  I'll make sure he knows this minute. Good bye Caller: Bye So went the call from my optician, in due course I went to the opticians to collect them; Me: Hello, it's Stephen Pearson about some contact lenses Receptionist: What about them? Me: Well I was hoping you could tell me... you call me, me... me brother! This morning about them Receptionist: Oh, well you can take them away now if you've had 'THE TEACH' Ok so I over emphasise the idea of the THE TEACH but to cut to the chase, basically 'THE TEACH' is where your told how to put them in and take them out and as I looked around seeing the opticians to be completely empty, I was told that they were quite busy so I have to go back tomorrow for THE TEACH.
