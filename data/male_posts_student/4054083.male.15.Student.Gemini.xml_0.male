Went on the computer, spent the larger portion of the afternoon setting up my ACID Planet account, getting my songs on the 'net. I'm hopin that works out well, had a reply within the first 5 minutes, so that was neat.      Read some more of my Kinky Friedman book "Greenwich Killing Time". The earliest one of the Kinky series they have at the library... sucks cuz this one's the last one I haven't read yet, so no more Kinky after this :(. Got through 2 quarters of it this afternoon, before and after calling Lindsey. She was sort of lazin around and sorta out of it today, so the talking was very minimal. Reminds me of how boring I am. My sence of humour is really turning for the worse, and it's prolyl cuz of my lack of friends. I seriosuly hope things turn around when I go back to school, or my teenage life is going to be one fuck-up of an existance. But then again, I always over-exaggerate my problems, so take that as you will.      I wanna let Lindsey go. I dunno. I say I wanna be friends, but I always feel like I'm looking for soemthing more, and that's never gonna happen, cuz she's always gonna be moving, or will be gone forever. That, plus the fact that I don't know if we're right together that way. I shouldn't let her go per se... I just need to stop thinking that thise friendship is gonna turn to something more, cuz it can't. Could just be me making excuses for today's shitty situation, so again, take it as you will.      Goin to Dad's tomorrow. Hopefully he's ina happy mood, and finds somethin for us to do. Sooner or later I'm gonna have to lose my dependancy deal, and I know it, it's just very hard to get out of. Like, I should be doing my own thing, going out, finding stuff to do on my own, but instead I depend on mom and dad to find shit for me to do, or go on the computer. Mind you, the computer is a nice home for me, I just dont have that at dad's so I haveta learn to do soemthing else with my time. Outdoors. With people. I need a job, but I just don't want to... for whatever reason, I dont know, I just dont want to. I always look to school for the source of friends and whatnot, and it's fearing me that that's not gonna happen this year... like everyone's not gonna give a flying fuck, and I'll be alone again, like I was at the end of the year, before I started clingin on Tyler Jones and his group.       I'm just confused. I don't know what I can do. I know what TO do, and I could fix my problem easily, I just dont know how to go about it for some reason... like... I dunno. Complicated shit. Point is, a solution needs to happen soon, or I'll end up ina hole at 15, and I dont want that.
