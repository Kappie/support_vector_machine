Today at work I was catching a fish for a Random Couple when I told them the name... A Pakistani Loach. Now to people with an IQ over 40 this means that they originate or were found in/near Pakistan. However when I mentioned the name the lady replied with a SNIGGER and "What they called that for?" My first thought was "Is she racist?" because it was like saying they shouldn't be called Pakistani, but then I thought is she just plainly stupid? When I was about 3 I used to think that calling a coloured person a Pakistani was bad.            After my little memory jog I then came to the question "Is she stupid?" Because she may have thought that Pakistani was a racist term...            Anyway all in all my day at work sucked ass, as usual. One of the managers is about as stupid as a fly; some woman asked me if we sold parrots and I mentioned that we had 2 due for sale in the next three weeks (we keep them in the back for a while for some random reason). Anyway turns out they're under strict quarrantine and therefore no one is allowed to see them (except staff of course) so I asked my manager if I could use my phone to take a picture of them to show the woman. She started telling me that if we let customers near them they might have birds and give them a disease and yada yada yada, blahdy blahdy blah... YAWN! Anyway she gave me a five minute speech, in which I replied "So I'm not allowed to photo them because..."            Oh well, I'm home now, as are my Mum and Dad who've just been to see my sister in Majorca. They had fun and gave me thirty quid because they couldn't find a pressie for me :D:D:D. I think I'm gonna buy a Gameboy Advance Game...
