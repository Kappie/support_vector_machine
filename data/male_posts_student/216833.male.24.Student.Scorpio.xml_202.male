I am stoked on life, just wish i could live without other people.  I can make page after page of people I hate and all the things they do that drive me insane. So ust to say what has happened since 1/15/03.  I left zales and started working at a bookstore with a paranoid obese woman and an idiot pysco kid.  Between the two of them, my generosity and kindness have disappeared in the work place.  I also work at a wildlife rehab clinic called Bird Rescue Center in Santa Rosa, CA.  I started there in March as a volunteer but was hired shortly after as a shift supervisor.  I guess I like to be an expert on everything.  So why not birds.  I really enjoy it, it has to be the most rewarding thing I have ever been a part of...
