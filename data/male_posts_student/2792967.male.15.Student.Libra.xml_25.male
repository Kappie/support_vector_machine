I have never even met this girl, but I cant get her out of my mind. I dont know what exactly it is, there is no way to know, I dont know her well enough, but still...She knows HTML, which is awesome because there is a commmon interest right there. Ive been reading her blog, and I think she plays the drums. Ok Dan, snap out of it. Anyway, its 5AM and Im sitting here blogging....how sad. Post again later  **listening to Jamiroquai - You Are My Love**
