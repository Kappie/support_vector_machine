Now i feel so stupid for what i did and now im depressed. The only way i get my depression out is from the music...I don't know why but it works for me. I can't really talk to ANYONE about it because someone else, besides them, ends up finding out. Plus, I don't really like talking about it...ah who care. Does anyone? Well, anyway, i found out that nobody is mad at me! Which is very good. And my friend agrees with what I did because I can't like someone that i just don't like. Well anyway i still feel bad.. just don't know what to do.. well, whatever....
