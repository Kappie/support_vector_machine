I gave up the position of head admin on Saturday. I needed some time away, plus, I am creating my new website, XNews:  urlLink http://xnews.000k2.com/phpnuke/index.php . I'm hoping that it can be finished by the time I go to Florida. If anyone wants to contribute, you can read the first message on the main page!  Anyways, I was going to say something.....I forgot. Damnit. Well, farewell for now!  ..::``Mike``::..
