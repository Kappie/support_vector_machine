OK, well here you go, its me,  J.R. , tryin' to get back on track with the  Evening Shift  (completely different from the  Graveyard Shift  by the way).  I heard that I had like 15 days or somethin' to blog or else  Nick  would...do somethin'.  Heh, I only heard, cuz I haven't been reading or making blogs recently.  OK, if you're expectin' some  "big bad ass comeback"  blog...sorry.  I dunno if this will meet  "big bad ass comeback blog"  status, or your standards...but I'm not here to meet your standards.  Right.  Well, if I'm comin' off as pissed...well you're wrong again.  Because I'm not!  Really!  Haha, even though the written (or typed in this case) word is considered one of the ways we express ourselves, its strange how sometimes written or typed words suck at expressing human emotion.  Just a thought...  Well, yeah I'm back, and hopefully I'll be more obligated to stick to it this time huh?  Well, thas it for now, since I forgot what I was goin' to tell you.  I'll remember...in a bit...
