But, like Kailey said, And I'll never forget. Whats there to take advantage of? I don't get people. And people don't get me. I don't understand how people can say sorry to you, but you know, sorry wont always cut it. theres a certain number of times that you can use it, for the person to realize that your bullshitting them.   As I was saying, when people say sorry, do they actually mean it? I want to see some statistics or something, cause man, today was horrible. I despise people. a lot actually. I don't know what to believe anymore, I don't know what to think anymore, people are there bullshit lies, people in general. fuck society, fuck friendships. i don't see the point. honestly. i think i have about two friends, who would do anything for me, IF that. so long folks.     i don't think i'll ever do anything for anyone, ever again.
