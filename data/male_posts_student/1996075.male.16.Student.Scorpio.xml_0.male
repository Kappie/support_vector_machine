Yeah anyway, i got like three hours of sleep last night becuase i started watching armageddon for some unknown reason and just  yeah...couldn't fall asleep. I've been told by a lot of people that whenever i seriously lack sleep i just get like...crazy and scary and all those things. Just beyond tired i guess. Definitely at that point now. So instead of actually paying attention in Bible, i'm posting on here, as usual. Can't possibly pay attention in here. Our teacher tells us to share notes with each other so yeah...whats the point. But i am going to do well in all my classes this year...i'm determined. I so took out lisa and sarah in french today on our quiz. Anyway, yeah this is just a bunch of useless rambling but thats okay. Almost time to go home...yay  rar ~Christy
