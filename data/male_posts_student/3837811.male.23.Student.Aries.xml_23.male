Nothing much to do today, went to buy pants for work alone, come to tink of it i got to work tomorrow, Arggh. Just dont feel like working after i started, feel like going back to my slack life before i start studies in SIM. But i need cash, so no choice..  Went jogging today, feeling lazy to jog, but got to do it. Haha, no pretty babes at the park today, just some kids fooling around.. Where is the babe with the dog... Haiz never saw her again ever since i saw her the first time, wonder which are the days that she will bring her dog for a walk, haha. Start to work on my website again, been a long time since i stopped, hope i can find time to complete it soon especially after working.. Should be crashing to bed soon, will be waking up to watch the Euro final, hope the underdogs Greece will win Euro2004! YEA BABY!
