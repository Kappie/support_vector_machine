[I couldn't make this one up,  urlLink check out the news article .]  This makes me wonder about future possibilities for complaining at restaurants.  If I am displeased with Red Lobster, ought I dress up like a huge red lobster and rail diatribes in the restaurant until the police have to haul me away?  Should I complain to Hooters by dressing up as an owl and hooting my displeasures up until I am arrested?  I'm not sure if the method is very effective at communicating to management your grievances or getting your money back.  But one thing is for certain: you'll get to go to jail and read about it in the news.
