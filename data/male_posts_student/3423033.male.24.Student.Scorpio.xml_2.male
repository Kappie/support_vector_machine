What I can remember of the dream began as a police officer (maybe the town sheriff) was asking questions about two murders: the one that I committed and one that happened right before. I don't know what the motive was, but I had memories and I knew that I was the one who killed a retarded girl in my town. This retarded girl really existed in real life Rootstown..  The dream started off with the unbelievable feeling that I was going to get away with murder. The cop didn't suspect me whatsoever, and neither did anyone in my family. I believe no one in my family knew. At one point, however, my mother pointed out that I should clean up the bloody stain on my dress, a bloody stain that I pointed out must have come from helping to slaughter pigs. The dream took a turn at that point, because now there was blatant evidence, and I had to burn the dress.  I went into the basement of the house, to fetch some matches and some gasoline, and somehow think of an excuse to get out of the house to burn the damn dress. I found the old container of gasoline, which was in a pretty small container that I tried to fit in between my shirt and pants (even though I am wearing a dress, not the dress that needs burning). It ended up that my father, who happened to be blind, needed to drive to his friends house, and needed me to be the eyes of the horse and buggy. I was happy to go, his friend's house would be a perfect place for the burning.  Before we left, I snuck into the woods to burn the dress. I poured some gasoline on it and tried to light it, but it just wouldn't light. So I was off with my father.  We showed up at the friends house, which was in the city. I went out to the street corner again, as dusk was settling in, to burn the dress. I finally got it lit and burning when my mother came out and my sister came out to talk to me. No one questioned about the dress, as if they knew what I had done and why I now was doing what I had to do.  The end of the dream consisted of my mother, my sister, and I 1000's of feet in the air lying on a giant bed of round little rocks that were slowly filtering down and lowering us down. The bed was along a cliff, but there was really nothing keeping the bed in the air. My sister and I marveled about the beauty of the world and the wonders of life, when our mother blurted out: "But you do not yet know either about the HIV or the blindness".  We asked what the hell she was talking about. She let the secret slip:  "Girls, the book of your lives has already been written"  With that, she explained to my sister that she would be stricken with HIV and blindness. I opened a copy of the book and skipped ahead to see that yes, tragedy would soon come to us all.  THE END
