So I visited the website and they've got this new version out but for the better version you have to pay $15 and to put it short, I pirated the program. So now I have the pro version of this program and it is so much better than before. It has a billion more radio stations than iTunes even though a lot of them are worthless and it also has internet tv. The tv part is awesome since I have a huge variety and all I have to do is double click to watch Korean music videos. Even with all of this it's still no where near iTunes and iTunes only plays music whereas Winamp plays practically everything. Which brings me to my next subject.  Today I was grabbing a Lipton Brisk Ice Tea, or at least trying to, they've been out for two and a half weeks now. So while waiting in line to see if the vending machine had been restocked, the kid in front of me who is pressing all of the buttons looking for some drink has these white bud earphones sticking out of the top of his shirt into his ears. I'm like "I know those..." and BAM, it hits me, those are iPod headphones. Wishfully thinking he might've just jacked the headphones from one of his parents I look for a square bulge in one of his pockets. My wishes are dropped like a hot potato. I thought to myself, damn, this kid has an iPod, even if it's three years old, it's an iPod. I walked away without inserting my dollar damning him to hell and envying him at the same time for getting one before me. Which brings me to my next subject.  My friend Jesse has offered me a job, a job that sounds amazing. Amazing because it requires no skill and there is no interview. Basically what I've gotten out of him is that various corporations are going to give him envelopes to stuff with letters, he will then split up the work between me him and a few other people, we do our work, give it back to Jesse, he gives it to the company, he gets paid and then splits it up with us. I'll get a lot more details the next time I talk to him, I'll make sure I press it out of him. The only reason the "job" relates to an iPod is that it gives me an enormous amount of motivation to work to get money to purchase an iPod to flaunt it in front of everyone. Which in no way brings me to my next subject.  I decided recently, even though this does not matter at all, that I will never use numbers in my writing but that I will always write out the numbers. So I would say ninety-three instead of 93. I like it and that's the way it's gonna stay. Which in everyway brings me to the end of this post.
