The first time i met Russell was at parkway when i followed Thomas to go skate. He was like doing all sorts of tricks that just left me sitting on the bench. But i remember him coming up to me and asking me why i wasnt skating. I told him that he was so pro and stuff but he said it was alright cuz thats how we all start off. And from that moment onwards i knew he was a nice guy. Since then i started skating with russ and the gang and soon formed our own crew. I gave the crew the name, it was called " THE BUDDIES ". Russ has taught me a lot both in skating and in life. He has taught me how to kickflip and nollie down stairs. He has also taught me many other tricks in skating. He has also taught me many things about life, one is that you should always have faith and confidence in yourself and that you should always think positively. He has taught me that you should cherish your friends because they are like your family, THE BUDDIES are a good example, we are brothers of different mothers. Russ has also taught me how to drum and now drumming is something that i really enjoy doing. He has introduced me to many different types of music and has shown me the value of life and skateboarding. Russ is also there for me when im feeling down. He is there to lend a listening ear and help me out. He is also there to give me advice on how i should handle the situation and i really grateful for what he has done for me. I would like to thank him for all he has done for me and i wanna wish him all the best in Hong Kong. Yes the heading may seem like he is dead but he isn't, he's just migrating to Hong Kong. Anyway THANK YOU RUSSELL SEAH FOR EVERYTHING! And a little goodbye for DARRYL SEAH, you will be missed too little man. Take care of yourselves in Hong Kong. If PA is feeling rich ask him to send me an air ticket, first class to Hong Kong so that i can come visit you.
