When I got to see my half-sister with her family, I feel so uncomfortable. I don't know the reason. As for my half-brother, he's so  pa-close effect . He sends me text messages which I habitually delete them.  Let's proceed to my evil wish list...  To my dad, I wish he'll pack up and go to Aklan and never come back. I don't want to see his face because I easilly get irritated.  To my sister, I wish she buy her own mobile phone so I can have my phone back.  As for myself, I wish that I could graduate from colleg, having nice (and good)grades, get hired on a nice job with a nice starting salary, and get my ass out of the house and never return.  Note: I'm only human, having evil thoughts is normal.
