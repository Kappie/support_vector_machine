We went clubbin but I cut out early.   I'm taking off on a spiritual quest from June 1-July 14. I originally planned to have a few traveling partners accompany me but decided I need to go it alone. The length of my trip has been extended to allow for more soul searching and give myself time to think about recent events. My destinations are Egypt, Vatican City, Tibet, Jerusalem, Italy, Greece and will finish in England so I can attend Cody and Ashlynn's wedding on July 10. I'm the best man so my presence is not optional.  Er will be apartment sitting for me while I'm gone.  Baseball season is back in full effect so my kids are hittin the cages more. They're throwing me a "goodbye" party towards the end of summer. I just told my soccer kids I won't be their coach this year and they all took it hard. I've been their coach for 3 years now for the reg season and indoor. It's going to be hard to leave them.
