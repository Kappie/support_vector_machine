I am going to shoot to get there around lunch or after. I just started listening to  urlLink Dashboard Confessional , thanks to sam u.  Also on my agenda is to see the movie  urlLink Collateral  starring Tom Cruise and Jaimie Foxx. I do not know why but this movie seems very interesting to me. Oh yes and lets see here, here is your funny video of the day. Just open it with windows media. The way the hosts reacted was the best part.  -Down? no. Out?  yea.  UPDATE:  I found the video on a site that must have linked it from that site.  I will try and find another site that hosts that video because its SO funny!
