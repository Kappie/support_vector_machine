So far, I have to get the cruise to Mexico done, the camping trip and the trek to water world( I get to swim in other peoples piss. Whoo.{Sorry Pierce, I stole your world})   I look forward to camping extremely, I don't know if any of you private school kids have done it, but camping is really fun. You get to get raped by mosquitos, have bears threaten your life, and food supply, and ummm lets just say if you have to go, you have to dig a hole, so yeah really fun.   Pierce got me started on Morrowind again, its a great game, but it's just so friggin big that it intimidates me, and the fact that it is so open ended is kinda nice. I hate how bethesda made the guards invincible. Bastards.
