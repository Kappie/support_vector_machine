I probably already railed against this one kid in a previous post, but I'm going to do it again, if not for the first time.   Once you've been in school for a semester (or two) you realize that you don't need to talk constantly to prove how intelligent you are.  This kid didn't get the memo.  Not only is he always decked out in pressed pleated khakis and a collared shirt, he occationally wears a tie.  For what reason I ask?  He talks more than the TA and has managed to derail every single discussion we've had in the class, managing in the process to confuse the others who don't understand rhythum.  I'm tempted to email the TA and ask her to put a leash on the Logan.  Last night, my roommate and assorted friends went next door to celebrate his 22nd.  Earlier in the evening, the barkeep married his girlfriend in the bar.  In front of the big screen tv.  Nuff said.  The place was "decked out" in white vinyl table covers and bows of lace on the backs of carved chairs.  Very surreal.  Plus I got really drunk, waxing philosophic on random topics and feeding the jukebox dollars and playing Shine on you crazy diamond pt. 1-5.  Also listening to autumnal "she's a jar" and reflecting on past fall events.  I think I'll get my hair cut tomorrow.  And takes a skills inventory test, seeing where my interests lie in jobs.  I've been thinking about what it might be like to live in Canada, Toronto perhaps.  Free health care.  Clean city.  Good hockey.  Accessability to the states.  Very prelim thoughts.  I'm also in the process of trying to write an elegy to my Grandpa.  I miss him a lot these days.  Think about what it would mean to him seeing me about to graduate from college.  He never did get to see me go off to school.  Lots of times I wish he would have been around a few more years so I could ask him more questions about his life.  The stories are intreguing.
