So the last time I studied html, I was 20 years old, and style sheets weren't being used yet, so I'm finding it a slow trial and error process to figure out what all the code on this page means.  It's so very addictive; kind of like a message board, only without all the other people.   Even though my only readers are my mom and my girlfriend, I can't seem to stop fiddling with things here.  Maybe some day I'll write something psuedointellectual, or at least mildly interesting.  Like why the url is spelled wrong, or the contents of my sock drawer (it's socks at the moment).  But for now it's just the contents of my brain, and an attempt to make anyone reading this as bored as I am.  urlLink School  doesn't start till a week from tuesday, my brother and sister in law are in  urlLink Minnesota , my girl with her gorgeous brown eyes won't be here till forever,  I haven't showered in a day and a half, and I'm all hopped up on caffeine.  I suppose I should be getting a head start on reading for my classes, but I don't think that's really likely today.  I might try to leave the house at some point though.
