Don't ask me how I remember that kind of stuff. It's one of the weird things that you learn to do(memorize long series of random numbers). I kinda like it because it's better than our old deskjet c890, and it comes with funky software. It has a scanner unit ontop of it, which is useful. So it works as a scanner, printer, and basically a fax machine. You can copy documents without your computer on. Although, when it DOES scan it automatically changes the picture according to a ratio to fit an 8*11 inch paper, with the set margins. If you've read this far, you're pretty dedicated.  Also, the 3rd age of KoC started yesterday, and thanks to a massive channel on their IRC network(usually give or take about 20 people from the margin of 350 people. That's MASSIVE) It's by FAR the largest channel I've ever seen on IRC. I know have twice as many troops as I had in the first week of the last age.     Reflecting on  urlLink Dom's post , I started reading a great book today called "The Dragon's son" by Margaret Weis. The description's in the book make it the people seem really colorful. It's like a REALLY well done painting, fluid with a theme and very colorful. I'm only around page 75, but her books have caught my attention. Ciao
