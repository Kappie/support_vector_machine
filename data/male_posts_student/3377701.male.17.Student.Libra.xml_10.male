Just another of my stupid accidents. Warmed up the garlic bread that came with the pizza the last time for breakfast. Played my notebook for a while, waiting for kafaii to arrive. Together , we left to the bank to activate our accounts. Didn't take too long, just a simple procedure. Recharged my pre-paid (don't ask why) and then we rushed to college. They're holding a Book Room, where we can buy our necessary lecture notes. We then had 2 hours break before the next lecture, so we decided to get our lunch at the Union House. 2 other friends joined us, they're from Malaysia too and from the same NS camp as kafaii. I ate kebab, the meat was not too bad but the bread was just too think. At the end of the meal i was exhausted from all the munching and chewing =P Kafaii on the other hand, ate tomyam noodles , but nooooo it wasnt enough. He had to feed on his friend's chicken rice too! tsk tsk tsk. Then we went to this common area where to got some rest, actually we were just killing time before the next lecture. We started to look at our Math 1 lecture notes, figuring out how to solve some questions ( Yes it's freakky i know ) After a long wait, the lecture started. It was just introduce to us on how to use the Trinity Portal. Nothing i couldn't do myself. It was soooo damn boring. Later, we found ourselves back home again. Didn't do much, just hung around till it was dinner time. Lipzhun went and joined his cousin, while me and Karen joined kafaii and his sis. His sister brought us to this Malaysian Chinese restaurant. Ate noodles with char siew. Not bad not bad. At least they had a decent ammount of vege in it. Haven't seen greens much these days...hehe. The night was still young, so they all came over to my place to just , umm well , hang out. Kafaii brought us to this website www.albinoblacksheep.com. It's full of lame video clips and laughed our heads off watching some of them ( SHOW ME , SHOW YOU , KIKKOMAN ! KIKKOMAN! hahahahahah ) Can't believe we spent 2 hrs on that...
