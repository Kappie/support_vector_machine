     
      screeching tires, revving motors far down on the street below.the constant ebb and flow of traffic soothes my restless dreams. red, green, and red again, the mechanical guardian directs our lives. honking of horns, out late, get home, and sleep sweetly to the sounds of the city. this world creates a vivid visual pallet of colors for wonderstruck eyes to gaze at endlessly. each sound a story, each story a life, each life alone, but one with the others.  the city never sleeps, though its people do, resting to once again inject their life into this hollow concrete shell.  lazily down the tree lined street a bycicle rolls, its driver unknown, its purpose certain.  this is MY city. this entire world existing for me alone to enjoy. but as it is my city, so it is everyone elses, theirs all their own.  together these worlds make up OUR city. the city we love, the city we are.
