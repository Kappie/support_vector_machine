I need to pick-up something nice for Gemma's birthday present and I need to get new pair of jeans, because my current ones (that I used to love) are falling off my ass constantly. I suppose I've lost some weight since going vegetarian. It also gives me an excuse to go to the mall.  I'm weird. I'm a guy, yet I somewhat enjoy the mall. I also like clothes. It's said I cannot afford more. I'm going to get these when I go tomorrow ( urlLink link ). They look amazing, hopefully they'll look even better in the store.  Over the weekend I went to Albany, NY with my best friend to an arena football game. It was a blast, we had an amazing time. It's a very exciting city and the drunks really made it quite an experience. Why do the most wasted and ugly people always want to dance? This is beyond me. There was no one good-looking on the trip perse, but New York has no lack of attractive people in general. I love New York. When I searched for "Albany colleges" I was a bit disappointed nothing came up that would suit me. I'm still keeping my fingers crossed for NYU.  I love New York. The city and the state. There's so much excitement and everyone's busy and it essentially never sleeps. It has a certain "aura." You become happy just by stepping in the boundaries. I had another smaller talk with a friend of mine about going to college. All he said during the entire conversation was how he'll miss his friends. This ticked me off in 2 ways. First of all, this friend only hangs out with freshmen and other over-hyped ADD children. Secondly, is he trying to imply I have no friends?  Maybe I'm just too self-absorbed. I'm upset my all-so-intresting friends haven't actually done much of anything this summer. Best friend was in Australia, so it's sort of an excuse. We saw Shrek 2 as well as the Albany trip. My other good friend (name withheld) hasn't talked to me like at all. We never see eachother during the entire school year and now it's like nothing. He's just working or talking to JP I suppose. It's aggrivating. I'll definitely see him on the 4th of July.  I'm pondering dirty-blonde highlights. Any comment? Talk to no one later.
