Okay, I can deal with James and Gennine, their dash of West Orange collaquialism is fine, but when I have to then try and interpret the parlance of my 20ish year old cousins as well it gets most frustrating.  Add in the stress of the twang of a Southern member of my family and the confusion only grows.  The nuances of this were further exacerabted on Christmas day.  Since my dearest Aunt Susan has, regrettablly, passed away, my wisest goodest grandmother dictated that we shant fret because our annually (in accordance with the sun and the good calendar of our lord and savior) held brunch would still convene.  The symposium was brief, and members in attendance were similar as the previous eve.  The addition were two aquaintances of my dearest goodest grandmother, both of whom added their southern vernacular to the linguistic soup around the table.     At this time, going home my current mental state was quite nebulous, so to further aggravate this state of affairs we traveled to Dover, to see my wonderful distant cousins new abode.   I wasn't feeling loquacious in any form, so instead I sat watching television (a game of hoops naturally) and feeling the resonance of those around. I finally was summoned to the central eating chamber, and networked with my great uncle (being that he is the brother of my fathers mother) about the things that had transpired in the year of which I still hold residence.  These effects percipated a great mental change in me this morning.  After promptly waking up to find my house abandoned, I walked to the room in which my family holds cooking in common.  Not wishing for any commercialized type of ceral, I pulled out a few frozen together patties, and rapidly changed their internal temperature via a heating apparatus.  Afterwards, I percieved a contained aptly containing dried cornmeal.  I added water to a small portion, and proceded to heat it until it turned to a thick paste, at which point I ate it.  This was my current day, up until now.
