It was great to have them back safe and sound, and I'm really looking forward to hearing all about what they saw and did.  The friend I mentioned a while ago as having problems is doing well. She sorted things out with her mum, went back to work, and things are looking up.  In two weeks I go back to Teachers College. I'm excited, but also nervous as this semester is going to be a hard one, as I have to repeat some papers I didn't complete last semester when things were going wrong. I'll be glad to get back into the study and get my brain going again. It may even improve some of my posts!!
