Serious bullshit.  We've created this overly complex "civilized" system, and we're still no better then neandrethals, except the fact we haven't all died off.   This just goes with that beast thing, we're all flawed.  We have this outer layer of neutrality, we could be good or evil, but on the inside we have this desire to undo all progress, despite what our  "Neo-cortex" or some bullshit tells us, our "Reptile brain" is still the thing that affects all our actions the most subtely.  All this crap we put up, is like painting a rotting house.  It'll just barely cover up the problems, but they'll become increasingly worse until the problems become so great, we are already at the point of no return.    Damn.  Okay, Enemies.com, to all my oh so loyal readers, has finally had those sidebars updated.  So now you are "free" to look at a few of the articles Reverend Maximus has up.  The one on Pre-Creation is pretty good, and a few clips of some of his new art are equally nice.
