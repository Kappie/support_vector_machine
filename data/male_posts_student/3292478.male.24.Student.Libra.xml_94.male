Not sure why I've never written about him before but suddenly felt the need to tonight. Probably because I was trying to work out the piano part to  urlLink 'Son Of Sam'  from his 'Figure 8' album. The last album before he died. Or was he murdered?  The man was a genius. There is no other way of describing him. Tortured. Depressed. Lonely. But the greatest song writer ever.  This picture is a snippet from the cover of his  Figure 8  album.  urlLink     A truly wonderful album. A demonstration of how truly great one singer could be, playing all his own instruments and doing his own thing.   urlLink     Really still can't believe he is dead. A legacy of beautiful songs, some sad, some just stupidly brilliant, keep him alive.  A beautiful man. Elliott Smith.
