It's that creepy...and it's one of Slipknot's best.   Alright, this post refers to my "best day all summer" post a little.  If you haven't read that one, you won't know what the hell is going on.  Do so.  In fact, if you do indeed have enough time to read this, read all of my posts before reading this.  It's a lot more convincing when you agree with me before reading this article.  I decided to talk to my friend, the one who gives out my screen name to random girls (once again, I have no idea why, but I count my blessings), because he had just come back from Turkey.  He thinks it's better than the US of A, but that's because he's a fucking liberal.  Go figure.  Liberals are stupid enough to believe that anywhere's better than the US, but that's because they're dipshits -- nowhere else can you get the freedoms granted to us in the constitution, even though those are being slowly eroded away by political correctness.  I would go on, but I have a subject line here, no matter how thin, so go to the link in the title for more information on this.  Back to the topic, he mentioned how it was his advice that I not get any ideas about that one girl -- whose screen name he gave me, to whom I have been talking since March, whom I met last Thursday, who is incredibly hot, and who is the only one of these girls who shows any interest in me at all.  Now, I've known this guy for nearly 2 years now, so I figured he had better have a fucking good reason for this one.  Then, he pulls the weakest excuse I've ever heard: she has been known to give up on guys after a week or so.  Now, that is weak.  Even if this were applicable to yours truly, I wouldn't give a damn.  She is hot enough that if I were with her for one week only, I would consider that time well spent.  Really well spent.  Now that I think of it, it would put me beyond the nerd hall of fame if I got busy with her:  it would put me in nerd Godhood, at which point people tell their children of my exploits and say "See? You can get laid, too, if you kick this much ass."  Of course, this wouldn't be true, because I kick way too much ass to emulate, but it's the thought that counts.  Besides, it would pretty much wipe out all the "Final Fantasy" geeks.    But it's not applicable, I figure.  Why?  Well, let's consider the facts.  I had been talking to her since March online (of her prompting much more than mine) before I actually met her.  Thus, there's gotta be something interesting here that kept her talking to me.  She goes to a public school, so I assume from this fact that most of her guys that she "gave up on after a week" were smacktards (I picked up that phrase from APB. I feel very patriotic) with cookie-cutter tastes and attitudes who had the intelligence of a bag of shit. (My friend has a tendency to leave out these details.)  She probably saw these idiots day after day, which would get monotonous even for me, and was probably constantly pressured by them to do more and more.  Damn, no wonder she gave up on them after a week:  that would even drive ME crazy, if I were in the opposite position.  Hell, she probably talked to me to break up the monotony.  I wouldn't get the chance to talk to her even every other day, really, so it wouldn't get too boring.  If you have been reading these posts, I would assume you have a good idea of just how unconventional and interesting everything I believe really is.  (Unless you're a commie punk fan who watches chick flicks, in which case you should refer to the notice at the top of the page in the light blue section...and by the way, if this applies to you and you are a guy, get a sex change or cut off your balls.  It will make it all less confusing for you whether you should be looking at guys or girls.)  Seeing all that varied shit I managed to pack into only a few posts, you can imagine just how interesting it would really be to pick my brain on a daily basis.    So, my friend tried to shut me down (he wants me to go for another one of his friends, but she just isn't interested.  I can't do anything if she isn't willing to hold up the other end), but I'm gonna keep on going, by God.  I won't be denied this one thing that is going right because some guy decides it's not in his gameplan for me to go out with one of the few girls who showed any (positive...in my life, the two majorities of girls are ignorers and stalkers) interest in me.  And, as God as my witness, I will prove him wrong about her, because it's the American way, dammit!  Damn, I feel patriotic now.  It feels like testosterone.  Having said that, there is nothing else I can really add to this post, so I will leave now.  Thank you, g'night!
