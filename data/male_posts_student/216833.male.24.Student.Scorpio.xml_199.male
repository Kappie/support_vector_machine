I had the chance to work with one of my fav birds for the second time this week. An Osprey, or Fish Hawk. What an amazing bird. This guy has talons as thick as a pencil and his feet are large in proportion to the rest of him. We got him in the center because he was down on the ground, some one caught him and brought him in - he was starving to death. So far things are looking good. Just the coolest thing to see - only the 40th bird of that species that we have had in the center for the last 20 years.   "I'm only a little pissed!"  Even rarer than that is a threatened species called the peregrine falcon.   I had the chance to work with him on Saturday, mon, and today and he is a very impressive bird as well. Fastest of them all and almost entirely wiped out by DDT. They were considered endangered for a time but have moved to only threatened with the banning of DDT in the US in the 70s.  anways, those were really cool. My day at the bookstore was simple and easy. Really just took it easy, and relaxed.  I have a few options for the 4th. In Kenwood there is the World Championship Pillow Fights, that sounds silly. Also, a guy from the Rescue Center invited mimi and i to his pool party. I think I might go to that. Could be some fun. After that, I dunno. Maybe find a carnival and see some fireworks or go see Minus the Bear in Petaluma. We will see. Have to go take my library books back tomorrow. I guess that was a 'note to self.'
