The Olympic Games will relax me mentally because they will distract me from any problems I have. I saw my therapist today. We just talked about the booklet I read "Coping with Stress" and it really heped me and I could relate to the symptoms it had in there. I love my therapist she is soo warm,comforting and understanding which is something I need in my life for someone to talk to me and for me to talk to them. My next appointment is September 7th at 11am. If any other NEW news pops up ill post/blog it here. GO CANADA in ATHENS!
