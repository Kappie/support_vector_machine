     
      I've started running cross country at school (all I need to do is to start swimming and I can be a tri-athelete: running, cycling, swimming). It's a lot of fun. I had my best run this morning. I did 3.5 miles in 24 min. not great, but I'll get better. And then after running, our team played ultimate frisbee with Southport and got stomped 23-0. We'll beat 'em next week.
