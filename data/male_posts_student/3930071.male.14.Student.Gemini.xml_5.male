If any of you have never been to the Carribean, i suggest you do. The water it beautiful and the people are very nice. Also, ive been searching for a GMail account invite. If any of you happen to have one to spare, I would really apreciate if you could send me it at buminabox618@netscape.net See you guys in a week, Carlos
