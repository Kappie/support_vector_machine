That's sorta the only thing on my mind right now...  To be honest there are two girls that I like... One, I met on the net and the other one studies in the same school as me... Why does life barrage us with choices?????  But choices are what separates us from others. Whatever similarities we have, it's always what we choose to do that counts. Teens seldom think of that when they succumb to peer pressure......  Ahhh I'm starting to talk like a college proffessor now... Eniwei, bye for now!
