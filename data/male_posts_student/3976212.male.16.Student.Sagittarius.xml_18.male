My day: Woke up for like 2 hours from 2-4am....fell back asleep (i usally dont fall a sleep until then) and finally woke up at about 12:15pm hehe.  David Moodie called me around 12:30pm..he said to meet me at the school in 25 minutes. I had my shower and got to the school. He was there with a friend of his-Tyler. Basicly from 1:30-7 we just stayed in the town area...went to Quality Foods for 4+ hours...in the upstairs starbucks place..We also went to Iris's house. She wasn't there but her sister was. She doesn'tlike me after our teacher caused all those problems for me in grade 8. I was partly to blame though..cause I was very stubbern about equal student rights/etc. He was a dick from day 1, just plain didn't like me. But then around halfway through the year I ended up in the school's own "alternative" program. Seriously, where the 'tards go. Around 8 or so David's mom came with her boyfriend (Brian) and we got a movie. We went back to David's house and watched the movie (Barber Shop 2). I got home around 10:30pm, then I got my keyboard, installed it, listened to music and guess what? my whole system blows. Some sort of power surge to the stereo. So now i'm using headphones until I get my computer speakers from my grandmother's on Saturday. I'm getting kinda tired..i should go to sleep before 2:30...... Also..I got my haircut yesterday..too short though..now im not gonna look too good for at least a week err.. Also, I went to the dentist yesterday (I hope i'm not repeating myself lol) and he evened my tooth closing to be more comfy hehe....ALSO the weather has been very nice lately...it was 31 today, suppose to be 34 tommorow...(thats a good 93F)
