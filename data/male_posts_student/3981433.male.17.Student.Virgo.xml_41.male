It was nice to see Shameela again...seems like a bit of a blagger though...telling be about all this cool stuff at uni and how she pulls all these guys etc...bit of a shock really - shes not the quiet, innocent lil girl that i've always known her as...quite the opposite infact.  Still, was nice to see her - we went on all the rides and I got soaked on the Log flume....bastards. she seemed to know all the male ride attendants too...says it all really...although there was this one who she really fancied but was too shy to go talk to...ha! looser!  oo we had moca-frapa-chinos at starbucks too...that was nice - gotta go there more often and fund globalisation :D  had dinner at Pizza Express...the waiters there must be thinking i'm a right man whoere lol...i've gone in there 3 times this year and each time its been a different girl...however i'm becoming a bit of a regular so i might even get my own table soon :D  so anyway...i get home and meesha comes online and tells me shes actually a virgin and she wants to screw me just to lose her virginity...i mean wtf!? honestly i mean come on...shes met me like once and whats my willy inside her...what the hell..NO! anyway...i fancy claire so i cant go and do sumthing like that behind her back.  ...well i could but i'd feel so guilty.  meeting up with Gem and Charli tomorrow to discus the Disney Land thing. and its raining now...and expected showers for the next 24hrs.
