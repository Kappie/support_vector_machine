Word is, he had been having heart problems for over ten years, some would speculate having been caused by years of steroid abuse.    Joe Laurenitis, AKA Animal, Hawk's longtime tag-team partner said that neither he nor Hawk had done steroids for over ten years.  Animal says that Vince McMahon beginning to test for steroids was one of the best things to happen to them.   Animal swears that steroids had nothing to do Micheal's death.    Regardless, the wrestling world has once again lost one of it's legends.  I remember seeing the Road Warriors on TV for the first time years ago.  They would come to the ring in their face paint, huge spikes on their shoulders, with "I am an Ironman" by Sabbath playing.  This was in the era before gimmicks truly caught on, and these guys were certainly unique.  The first time I saw them in person was in 1988 at the very first Clash of the Champions in Greensboro NC.  They were in a barb wire match with Dusty Rhodes against the Powers of Pain and Paul Jones.  I think that was my very first brush with "hardcore" wrestling.  Hawk and Animal showed up on RAW earlier this year in a one-shot deal, wrestling Kane and RVD.  When they came to the ring, I have to admit, I marked out huge.  Sadly, after the match was about three minutes old, it was obvious that the LOD were mere shadows of their former selves.  RVD and Kane managed to carry the match and make it look decent enough though.  All in all, it was great seeing the two together again.    I read that recently Hawk and Animal did an indie show in Chicago to commerate 20 years of tag team dominance.     urlLink ProWrestlingTorch.com  reports that there will be a tribute show on Nov. 1st at Birch Run Michigan, followed the next day by a fund raising breakfast on the 2nd, with proceeds going to the family of Hegstrand.  Laurenitis plans to be at both events.  Thanks for the memories, Hawk.  The Great Wrestling Ring in the Sky just got a whole lot more hellacious.
