By reasonable I mean preventing harmful or misleading products from being sold. Or is it better to have active government intervention, such as farm subsidies, tariffs, the Federal Communications Commission, etc?        2. Do you favor a graduated or flat system of income taxation? Not that salex tax is an example of a flat tax that makes no distinction between rich or poor but has the rich paying more due to higher prices of goods and services.        3. Does the United States have a right to act unilaterally to ensure the safety of its citizens? Also, do we have a moral obligation to make the worlda generally safer and more free place?        4. Why is President Bush so evil and loathsome to the Left? I can honestly see no rational reason for it, as he has implemented policies far mroe liberal than Bill Clinton was allowed to. A medicare perscription drug bill, letting Teddy Kennedy write the Education bill, No Child Left Behind, etc.These seem to be cornerstones of a socialist policy that the Left favors. Why isn't Bush then likable or at least tolerated? Is it merely some sort of projection - a need to blame someone for the things you don't like?        5. Why can't we all agree on the Facts? I refer to Facts such as Saddam's use of andpossession of WMDs and his refusal to comply with UN sanctions. Facts such as Kerry's reversal of stated positions. Facts like the improving economy. These facts are real, yet they are denied or ignored by the Left. Why?        6. Do you claim to understand the meaning of the National Debt and its uses? It is not simply a "Debit" column in the national ledger. It is not soem large amount of money that must actually be paid back some day. It is the obligations and securities of the Federal Government. It is simply the cost of running the Government expressed as a simple number. It cannot ever be "called in" like a home mortgage. To draw an anaolgy, Donald Trump made his fortune primarily in real estate investing. He took out gigantic lons in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He did so in the knowledge that he wasnot going to pay them back under the initial terms. So when he could not pay, the lenders were forced to give him mroe favorable terms because the sheer amount of the loan was so massive that if Trump defaulted the lenders would go bankrupt themselves. A similar situation exists in the world today. The US Dollar is so ubiquitous and necessary that to allow it to become devalued substantially (by refusing to honor the credit of the US) would collapse the global economy.        Sorry about that tangential discussion. To put it simply, I want you to tell me why the National Debt is some sort of issue, along with the Deficit.     7.Why should taxpayers fund PBS/NPR? Whatclause or amendment mandates or even excusesraising taxrs to pay forsome media broadcast?       I think thats enough for now. Sorry to do a pseudo double-post with Todd's Litany of Questions.        I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise. This is my opening salvo. We should use current events to illustrate and discuss fundamental concepts. I don't care to discuss Michael Moore's latest stunt or Kerry's latest gaffe. Because those don't really matter. We can discuss issues such as the cost of medicine, the War on Terror, and other issues of the day but I will always try to steer it towards some basic concept.        I want you to answer both Todd's and my questions with reason and in some depth. I may be wrong, but I wager you have never truly pondered the ideas behind your stands on issues.        Don't dissapoint me and refuse to take up my challenge.
