That's great!  I heard of two books for a long time: "an introduction of general system thinking" and "psychology of programming" which are written by a very famous writter, weingberg. But unfortunately, I failed to find them although I see the index entry in the library.    By the way, I have a glimpse on the book "practical programmer", also read "How to be a excellent programmer" in Chinese translation. It's good. Not only it says something about coding(actually, I don't like the word "coding". It makes people think it's a stupid work), but also says something about how to work as a programmer. For example, it gives a story about "stone soup" and "boilded frog" to explain we should be a catasclyst of changing and should focus on big picture(keep on reviewing").   Anyway, not bad.  I love reading, but I am not patient enough to finish a "BIG" one. I'd like some fast-food articles, unfortunately, it's not that nutritious. But the problem is: I want to get the maximum in a minimum time. How could I?  Maybe I should change my reading habbit or improve my reading effeciency.
