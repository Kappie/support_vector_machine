I hate how it is either too hot out or too cold out. I wish it would just stay one way.  Got into a few arguments today about punk and Halo. I was going to write about punk today (what with me being called a "psuedopunk" today and all), but I decided not to. I'm ok with myself, and I don't need to defend my punkness to other people.  My CD Adapter broke today. That is the worst thing that has happened to me in a while. I don't know how long I'll be able to listen to the Power Loon until I freak out and drive off a bridge.   (maybe if someone would give me the money they owed me)  Anyway, I read this on punkrocks.net today, they're talking about Troy: aaronfeibus (7:53:10 PM): be tru to the story dogg kevwad (7:53:28 PM): yeah aaronfeibus (7:56:39 PM): like an almond aaronfeibus (7:56:42 PM): almonds dont front aaronfeibus (7:57:02 PM): theyre like "yeah we are dry and wrinkly on the outside" aaronfeibus (7:57:11 PM): "...but bite into us and we taste damn fine"  Funny.
