I've come up with a lot of reasons since becoming a dedicated blogger.  A blog serves as a method of organization.  I can read through old posts and figure out what I've been feeling.  Not only that, it's a way to tell people who you are and how you're feeling without a lot of unnecesarily awkward conversations.  Not only that, but I feel a lot more comfortable talking about myself and who I am now.  My blog allowed me to come out publicly.  I like that.  My blog has allowed me to bitch without getting on the nerves of my friends.  But what I've learned from this is an entirely different question.  I think that I've realized how fucked up my life, and everyone else's really are.  We really are unique.  We all have fucked up problems.  I've also realized that I am a troubled person, as much as I'd like to think that I am satisfied.  There is so much shit I want to accomplish.  This is kind of a log of that, but also a mark of my failures.  I want to amount to something.  I don't want to just make money.  I want to give something back.  I think this post exemplifies my blog.  insightful (I hope,) but most of all rambling and incoherent.  -Mike
