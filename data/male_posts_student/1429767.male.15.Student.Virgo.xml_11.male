Behind closed doors In my bedroom You can’t see my pain I sit there and cry But what about, I can’t explain I have these feelings Once in a while I can’t seem to let them go I only wish you could understand these feelings I only wish you would know I hide this pain I hide my tears Because I am afraid I don’t want you to know I am hurting That I am going through this pain That’s why I shut you out Because sometimes I don’t even understand Why I feel this way, why I am so sad When I feel this way, time can only make me better But I only get worse And every time I have these feelings I wish I weren’t alive Because sometimes these feelings get too deep And I’m afraid I won’t be able to hide them anymore I only wish I could let you know Because I need someone to understand my pain But I feel like nobody knows how I feel Nobody feels this way So behind closed doors I will stay Until I can understand why I feel this way
