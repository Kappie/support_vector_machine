So I baked muffins last night, talked to Jon on the phone, and then recorded some "musaac" until my eyelids obscured my vision. Ergo I was then Asleep. Thus, I woke up this morning fatigued and quite in need of a good espresso, alas I did not have this and I am now running on empty at this point and time.  But I will wrok thru it. Ill post more in a few mins when I can find something interesting to post about!
