If the world isnt ending in one million different ways, the terrorists are planning to do it in yet another. Then there are the natural disasters, the emotional ones, the ridiculously obscene ones. Everything these days is no longer built to spill, but built to scare. I hate the fact that i am effected by these things. I read something in the paper today, and it jarred me. I literally stopped, and just thought about what that could mean.   Rick said to me immediately after that day in September, that if its going to happen, it will probably happen whether we want it to or not. Because of this factor, we cant spend every day of our forsaken lives worrying about whether we are going to get nailed by  a taxi or fumed by some gas. We have to love the ones we love, and live the life we live. We cant spend our entire lives hiding in a hole to afraid of what  could  happen. This is not my attempt to be a pseudo intellectual, or to be something im not, its just my thoughts for the night. I got scared today, and i shouldnt have been.
