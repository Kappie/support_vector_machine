As most of you can see i have a counter, and well if anyone (like me) clicks on it they can look at all the stats. one of the things you can access is recent visitors where it gives all sorts of information about the 10 last visitors to the site. well a few times that i was perusing though there i checked where some of my readers were coming from and on more then one occassion i'd find a link that was someone searching for something along the lines of "kinky dog sex" or "kiddy rape" or some such fucking perverted thing. but then...it hit me if i (blow job, XXX, sex, 69) put random (anal, ass, tits) sexual words up (sex sex sex) i can (i'm only putting sex now because small children can access this site) get more people to come to this site. but then i figure that i really shouldn't beacuse those people won't really read my site, they're just there to get their jollies off. and that would make me a hit slut and then years down the road i'll feel all empty inside for just appealing to meaningless readers that meant nothing to me. instead i should just try to get meaningful readers that i can have deep reader writer relationship. that's a lesson for all of you out there. skip the clap! wear a cap! -Matt
