We didn't attend the  akad nikah  the night before as my mum just get back from Singapore.   1030 - Arrived at Bukit Bendera Resort, Mentakab. All of mum's sibling and their family is already there except for Pak Teh Fuad who's working at Labuan. The nine families put up in ten rooms but it's still a bit too cramped for all of us. I had a late breakfast at one of the rooms and have some chat with my uncles and aunties. Meanwhile, my cousins are enjoying themselves at swimming pool.  How about the bridegroom? Heh, he's having a quick nap. The bride is at her parent's house.  1200 - Check out from hotel. We make our move to  rumah bersanggar  near the bride's house.  Rumah  bersanggar is usually a neighbour or relative house where the bridegroom will prepare himself for the bersanding ceremony. While waiting for the rest of our 'batallion' to come I took the oppurtunity to chat and update with two fellow family tech heads - Brother Norman and Jamil.

Upon reaching the bride's house compound the bride came out of her house before the couple walks side by side into the house for the bersanding ceremony. The ceremony took about half an hour. After that is a photo session before the couple have their first lunch together as husband and wife.   1430 - We head back home. Plan had already laid for the man's side reception which is scheduled for end of this month at my grandmother's house at Pagoh, Muar, Johor.     The Couple in Royal Yellow
