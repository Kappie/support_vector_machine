It is kind of sad, but we knew it was coming. She was fighting cancer for 5 years. But on a happy note I got my license! I hung out with Joe, Meghan, and their friend Erik till like 1 in the morning. I slept in till about 9:30, which is a long time for me, lol. Well that is about it. If I get to a computer at all this weekend I will post, if not, I will voice post. So until then, I am out like a fat kid in dodgeball.
