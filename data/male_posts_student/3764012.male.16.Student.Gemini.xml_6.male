The fire in me is growing stonger as well just like poke even though i did not take O level mother tongue but i feel the heat in my heart .... the power to push me forward is growing stronger , the determination !!! .... I want to excel ! ... I hope this fire will bring me to success ! ... Nothing can stop me now ! ... i am going to start my future now !!!....eventhough we are normal acdemic students but it does not means we have no chance but instead we have chance but only we have to work double or even triple harder !!! Nelson you can do it !
