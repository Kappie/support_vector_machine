[based on the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams]  This blog originally featured the daily/weekly rantings or a disgruntled teen, who disliked pretty much everything that isn't how it was in the good ol' days. After a few weeks, I ran out of things to moan about; even grumpys like me have some limit to our unhappiness at the world. So with the rantings out the way, the blog slowly started to chronical the daily happenings of dave, which mainly mentioned revision, homework, and generally being bored. The blog supressed this boredom a little, but not enough. With homework finishing and revision started, my boredom level rose significantly; revision? Pah! Who needs that? Well, I do, and no doubt on August 26th I will figure that I should have revised more. And then the exams started. And then they finished. The Summer started. A whole 10 weeks of nothingness to look foreward to. And here I am. This story will continue, until March 14th, 2062, when I will meet my timely end, most likely due to suicide (according to a quiz from a while ago).    Waffle out the way, I best write something of more interest or I will lose my good readers. I shall write the happenings of today. I got up, I read the Fellowship of the Ring, I went on the internet, I read some more, I went on the computer more, I read some more, I played chess (and won), internet, reading etc etc. I need a life. And I watched some special features from Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers DVD. Which were ok, if you have nothing better to do.    And I just remembered - last night I watched 'Alien' for the first time, which I recorded from the day before. Started off a bit slowly, but soon picked up, with plenty of blood, and aliens bursting out of stomaches. Lovely. :)    Anyway, back to The Fellowship of the Ring. I'm up to chapter III of book 2 - The Ring Goes South. The Fellowship has just left Rivendell. The book started off rather slwoly, but it's now very good. All should read. Especially urlLink Megatrobe,  who now seems to read a lot. READ IT!!!    I think that will be all my blogging for today.  Bye for now.     Weather:  Heavy rain earlier, now cloudy   Reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring   Listening to:  Film Themes Playlist   Watching:  Alien   Confused about:  Nowt (I must find more things to be confused about)   Annoyed with:  Boredom   Mood:  Fine
