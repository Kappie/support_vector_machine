Tania, in addition to being my lovely wife of almost 19 years (gasp), is a talented writer and thinker. (Well, she can be forgiven for not thinking clearly when she chose a husband.)  Aaron had absolutely no choice in the matter of being related to me -- he was born that way. My youngest brother possesses a fantastic sense of humor and his own unique style. (Because you see, if it wasn’t  unique , then it wouldn’t be his  own , now would it?)  Please welcome them both. I look forward to their contributions to the experiment.
