And she asked me a difficult question: "I want to ask you a question, but don't think I'm trying to be mean, Why did you want to get my number?"  Uhhhh, hmmmm, exactly how do you answer a question like that?  I said something like, "Well, I wanted to get to know you because, ah, uh, I had seen you in the halls at school and was like wow and so I wanted to talk to you and get to know you and, well, here I am.  Is that okay?"  She said something like "Yeah."  Whoa!  That's a difficult question to come up with a half-decent answer in a short period of time.  I  shoulda  said she could ask if I could ask one to, "Do you mind me callin' you or would you rather I didn't?"  I think that woulda been a pretty fair trade, well, kinda.  Enewayz, after the question/answer moment we started talkin' about what we did last night and stuff like that.  Then she had a beep.  When she got back she said, "Um, that's Troy on the other line.  I'll hafta talk to you later."  Well, alrighty then, I think I'll  try  to talk to her Monday at school but I'm gonna try to get  her  to call  me .  We'll see what happens.  And, as always, I'll keep you posted.  In funny news for today, Mom and I were driving through the intersection at W. Eastland/Cleveland and McFerin and there were people in the road begging for money (representing a cause).  The cause they were representing:  " Adopt-A-Addict "  Isn't that hilarious?  Are they gonna buy the drugs for the addicts so the addicts don't have to turn to crime to support their habits?  (BTW:  Does anyone notice the gramatical error in the cause's name?  It should be "Adopt- an -Addict.")  Well, I've got to go clean my room, mow the lawn, and sweep off the front porch and sidewalks.  Grrr!
