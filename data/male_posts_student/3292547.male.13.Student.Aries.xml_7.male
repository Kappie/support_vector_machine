There were about 40 or so plants (trees/bushes/flowers/shrubs) in an area that was way too small. The yard itself away from the house was huge. With 3 people working nonstop (me, my sis,my mom) it took 4-5 hours!  Ok, also, don't think I've forgotten  urlLink Einstein's Quiz  because I haven't. The answer is the German. That's right, the German owns the fish. Though it will be a long time before anyone reads this, just post a comment in the newest post I have (that's general- please not a software post, etc) if you'd like to know how I and others got that. It took me about 45 minutes while it took others from 10 all the way to 25. I'll post the answer as I comment as soon as I'm done typing this.  I haven't gotten to talk to my best friend lately. He's been studying as he is in collage. That should explain why he's studying even when school's out. Thank God for that, but we have to go back in just under/over 2 months I wish it was more like 2 YEARS. When it starts back I'll be in 8th grade. I've probably said this a lot, but oh well. I'm crying for ya. Not really, because I don't know who to cry for that reads this.  To Be Continued
