       
      The other day I was sitting in my composition class, looking out the window. There was a large tree on the lawn of the school. It was mostly bare, nearly all of the leaves were on the ground around the tree. But there was a large section on the right side of the tree that was full of leaves.  I don't know why I feel compelled to mention this, only that I am.
