Firstly, I am just about on schedule for my Harry Potter readin task, which if you didn't know was to read the 5 books in 19 days, before the last exam. I worked out it came to rougly 115 pages every day, which I may just about manage. In the 2 days gone, I have read the 220 pages of the first book, so I seem to be going well. I'll need to read the first 125 pages of the second book later today to get it all read on time.  In other news, I had English and Geography exams yesterday. I was one of the few who thought the english one was fairly challenging, but I hope I managed to at least get a B. After that, many went home, but several, including myself, megatrobe and nonnesuch had to stay for the geography in the afternoon. We spent a little time revising, first outside, then in the hall, not that you really wanted to know that. Revision then started getting dull, so we turned to discussing random stuff, and then decided to take another walk in the woods behind the astro-turf. We came out the other side and walked back to school along the road.  Geography wasn't too bad, I thought it would be harder, but I seemed to do ok. A grade A would be very nice, after all, most of it's just common sense.  That evening I spent a lot of time reading Harry Potter, yes, I know I should have been revising, but meh. Oh, and I have made quite a change to my life aswell. Wait for it.... I ate chicken for dinner, 'twas in a nice sauce thing. It actually didn't taste too bad. (At this point I should probably mention that I haven't eaten any meat but fish for about 3 years.) I don't really know why I didn't eat meat, just out of habbit really. Anyway, I've decided to slowly introduce meat back into my diet, as it is probably good for you, and I was never really bothered about the animals anyway. I still don't think I like beef or lamb though...  And then came this morning, when I walked to the last ever German exam. It turned out to be surprisingly easy, most of it just multiple choice. But no more German.... EVER. That is a very good feeling. Oh, no more geography either, but that wasn't as bad as German. All that vocab learning.... *shudder* So, I walked home after the 50 minute exam, turned on the computer, and here I am. And that's everything that has happened between the last blog and now.  Today, I will probably watch Jurassic Park III, which I taped from Wednesday, I didn't see much point staying up past 23:00 with an exam the next day. I'll also do that reading, and maybe some chemistry and bio extension revision.  That's all for now, bye all.   Reading:  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, soon  Listening to:  Matrix Architect Speech. Yep, you all know I am sad...  Watching:  Jurassic Park III later  Confused about:  Why I gave up meat in the first place  Annoyed with:  Steinbeck, from English exam  Mood:  Good.
