LMAO. then phoebe and kiz came over and we discussed jason's  wig  ^__^ being pretty much the same with or without gel. haha.  rajiv decided to crack open some nut thingo which contained two seeds...big ones mind you. no sexual connotations there of course. chem, like last wk was laughable. amongst 'wig' discussions, kiz decided to check out the guyz in the class, we ate phoebe's crackers, looked up  wig  in my english-jap dictionary ---  katsura , and attempted to understand what shyam was teaching us.  oh...and i saw tim wong yesterday too ^__^ he looks like a gangster HAHA --- apparently a  nice  one? today, won't even bother talking about. went to library and that's it. going to jap restaurant tonight. so yeh.  studying  latin atm.
