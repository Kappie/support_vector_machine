I was on phone with Melissa for a couple hours and then I chatted with Cissa for a bit afterwards, before going to bed. I just had a late breakfast of scrambled eggs and potatoes.  Now playing: Dashboard Confessional - Jaime (Weezer cover)  I have a shitload of work to do tonight. Inhye is supposed to be over later to discuss the readings for our class and give me a ride to the grocery store.  Now plaing: Ozma - Spending Time on the Borderline  I need to organize my time better from now on. I should try to do readings in the morning. Maybe drag my ass out the door every morning at the same time to read in the library?  ***
