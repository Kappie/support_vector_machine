Matrix Revolutions was not as much of a disappointment as Reloaded. The story was OK, the battles were cool. However, it was an amalgamation of too many other films. For instance, a bit where some light goes through Neo's body which is also at the time made of light looks remarkably similar to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Also, random asian kid with an annoying voice. Marx didn't like the direction, personally I can't comment, I know about as much as the next musician about directing. I must say I give it about 5/6/7 out of 10, whereas the Mail gave it 2.  Hm, really want to talk to Miller again, she be cool.  England are playing Wales today at rugby. Guess who my support will be going to? That's right; Cymru all the way.  No time for a poetic quote, I apologise. I'll see what I can do later. Sorry...  Love, Jon Roskilly
