Ah well...at least it isn't doin the same stuff as during the week.  As you probably can guess, this weekend was one of those busy ones.  Not that I minded - it was also a fun weekend.  Saturday was nice b/c I got to wake up and snow-blow the driveway, which I just kinda like to do.  But I found another pet peeve of mine while I was doing it - people who don't dig grass out of the cracks in their concrete sidewalks.  I swear, I was blowing the sidewalk (you know, to be nice) and I got past our property line and every other sidewalk crack had grass growing so high out of it that it just totally messed everything up (literally - you don't understand how horrible it looks to had sod laying on top of perfectly white snow...it ain't pretty :P).  Not to mention about throwing me over the top of the snowblower...  Anyway...so after that I pretty much didn't have anything goin on until I was working the Saturday night service at church.  I watched the Mount Union championship game (and, I have to admit I was sorely disappointed to see them lose).  Then...man, I don't remember what I did - obviously nothing important :P  So anyway...went to work the service and found out that a guy I played football with in high school got married at our church that day - a bunch of people I kinda knew were walking out of the reception and all.  I don't know whether it was that or being at church or just being worn down from the week, but I was in a pretty bad depression pretty much throughout the service and the evening - you know, gettin those thoughts about how much of a loser I am and all, how I'm fundamentally unhappy, etc.  Thank God that periods like often don't survive a good nights rest.  This morning was a lot better - in fact, I would say that I was downright happy.  Worked all three services - saw Matt Mead and Mr. Myers at church today.  Matt is in grad school @ Notre Dame for accounting, Myers is still teaching at CVCA - basically we just reminisced about CVCA and went over the changes goin on there (we pretty much all agreed that finally getting rid of Haslett was great :P).  Got home and watched the Browns game - all I have to say about the Browns is "GGGRRRRR" (insert exasperated grimace).  Well, at least the Cavs are fun to watch now :)  Went and caught Return of the King tonight...I won't ruin it for anyone, but I think that it's probably the best of the three movies (which is saying a lot).  There were so many parts were Ed, Jeff, or I let out one of those "Oh yeah!" comments...it was just a sweet movie, y'know?  And I love the more metaphysical aspects of it - it's not all just things mindlessly blowing up and all.  I was gonna get together with Lisa tonight, but that fell through when brilliant boy (yours truly) had the wrong number for her house in his cell phone.  Ah well...I guess all you can do sometimes is laugh at yourself and make lemonade (how cliche is that?).  So now it's now, and I'm gonna head to bed so I can get up for another exciting day at work tomorrow.  I have to admit, things are really starting to drag there now...I definitely need to go in tomorrow with my mind made up to FIND productive things to do or I'm going to end up basically wasting a day that I NEED to do productive things with...
