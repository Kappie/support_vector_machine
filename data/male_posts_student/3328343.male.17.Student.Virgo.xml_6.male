I mean, I need someway to be popular and accepted by the "in" croud so what better way then to copy everyone else!   I had a dream the other night, and it wasn't one of those dreams where you kinda remember but it's hazy and junk like that. This was frighteningly real.(I was unsure about the spelling of the word frighteningly so I looked it up on dictionary.com, I was right, yes! confidence boost!) On with the show. I'm in a large room like a gym, but there's a second story balcony and there's tons of people. Everyone I know from school and church are here. I know something is wrong though, somehow I know that there's people with guns pretty much holding us all hostage, but they're in a room attached to the gym so I can't see them. For some reason we're all crouded around looking curious like, "Hey this is interesting, what's goin on?" So we're all milling around and all of a sudden I'm holding an AK-47, sweet. I'm standing around then this big fat General from the foggy scene in The Last Samurai comes up to me all angry or something. I'm not sure what he was doing but I knew he was mad at me and I had to do something about it. I'm holding an AK which now has an enlarged bayonet on it which I have now flipped out. I'm a little freaked out now pretty much knowing what I'm going to have to do. I got this feeling like when you're playing paintball and you're right up close to an opponent. You know what you have to do but there's no way you wanna run out in the open and bunker him. You know you have to do it, it's you or him. So I went for it, I stabbed him with the bayonet, and I could actually feel it go in, then I notice it didn't stop him so I jab him again. I'm scared out of my pants now so I drop the gun and take off out the back door where Thomas, Tyler, Mike, Ashley, and the rest of the crew are getting on busses. I jump on one of the busses and we're driving down Harper Canyon Road and now I know I'm safe. And that's it. Woah.
