So it's hardly surprising that those highly talented individuals at Dreamworks have worked so painstakingly on bringing us a sequel worthy of carrying the name.  When last we left the Mike Myers-voiced fairytale ogre, he was heading happily off into the sunset with true love and brand new missus Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the pair were all set to live happily ever after. But it's not long before they're having their first round of marital difficulties and - as so often seems to be the case - it's provoked by a trip to visit the in-laws.  This is a marvellous little bundle of laughs, featuring a nice mixture of old favourites (including Eddie Murphy as the voice of the ever-irritating but strangely adorable Donkey) and gleefully observed new characters (among them John Cleese and Julie Andrews as the disapproving King and Queen of "Far Far Away", Jennifer Saunders as the meddlesome Fairy Godmother and, best of all, Antonio Banderas with a swashbuckling interpretation of Puss In Boots).
