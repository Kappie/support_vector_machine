BUT i have lavish amounts of time on the comp to blow off steam with my clan online. Nice post here's what i did yesterday        1:00pm, got out of bed and shower and all that stuff.       1:30-3:30 blog and game and annoy nathan on im.  3:30-5:30 work my A** off in tennis, also rains in     tennis but the main guy doesn't care if its hailing.  5:30-5:45 ruin camera taking pics of all the hail and rain  5:45-11:00 play BFV like no tommorow.  11:00-2:00am watch TV in bedroom, including the great RENO 911 and The daily news from witch i will quote "Batman and Robin have come to save the people that wish they had a role in politics, including Ozzy and Halle Berry
