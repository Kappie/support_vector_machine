I thoughtI had everything, but I don't. (For one, where would I put it?) I also found out why I have that feeling, I need someone to love, I need somebody to love me. The thing is; Who? Most people, except my friends (Most of which male for the reasons I am about to explain), take 1 look at me and all of a sudden I'm breathing, living shit to them. Not the greatest feeling in the world.    The other day, I was hangin out with a few friends, (who are skaters/rockers and stuff. I'm a kev/neutralist) and on my way home I was asked by a few kids (Couldn't have been older than 11-12) if I was one of them, if I worshipped the devil, and why I don't dress like that. Now, most people in that situationwould've replied "No ,I don't worship the devil, No I'm not one of them, and I don't dress like that because I'm not one of them", but me... Ho no... Not me    I said to them "I was worse than them, I was the devil's child, and that I don't dress like they did because I'm in disguise working for the devil", and one of them held a cross to my face!!! So, I pushed him down, and the rest ran (bless em, lmao) and carried on walking. It wasn't the best feeling in the world either, this world is all about appearance.     All I ever wanted was to be loved, right from the very start, and all people wanted to do was hate me, run over me, shit like that. I'm not fucking standing for it anymore, it's the end of that shit. If people hate me from first glance, then I know that they're a shallow twat for thinking that. If they talk to me for a while, and they hate me, ok fair enough, we're not meant to be friends, I can dig that. Doesn't bother me in the least.     Anyway, back to my first point: Incompletion. Yeah, I feel incomplete, not much I, myself, can do about that, but other people... They can. I can think, right off the top of my head, right now, 3 people who have made me feel like that in the last month (Not gunna say who, I'm not that sad). But I don't care, if they're gunna be like that, after knowing me for nearly 3 years, not necessarily speaking to me for that period of time, but whatever, if they're gonna be like that, after making me think I was friends with them, fine. That's all I have to say on the subject.        MSN username: I have everything I could want, except 1 thing; love. You do not know how that feels, I am alone.        Well, that's the end for now,        Paul ...
