Good points being that the time flew by, and there weren't too many people there.  Bad points being that I managed to slit my finger open on another damn rose plant, I had to scan through a  whole fucking trolleyful  of small cactus plants, and had to stop after every few plants to pull the fucking spikes out of my hands. Also, my first customer was none other than my French teacher. Then at the end of the day I was given a brush and assigned the wonderful task of sweeping the whole shop area. Which kinda did my back in. And took ages.  On the upside...Euro 2004 started today!  Theres only been one game so far: The host nation Portugal hosting the generally low-quality and funny-player sounding Greece. Portugal, being favourites to win this match by a long way, went and messed up badly. They lost 2-1: Goals coming from Giorgos Karagounis and a penalty from Angelos Basinas, then a last-minute effort from Christiano Ronaldo.  Not bad for Greece, this was their first even win in a major football tournament. Russia and Spain are playing in about 30 mins time (from time of writing this). So...good luck to Greece and Russia: hopefully they'll take out Spain and Portugal so England wont have to worry about them if/when they get through. WOOO!
