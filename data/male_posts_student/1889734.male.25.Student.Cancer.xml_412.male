But I realize that I can’t effectively respond until I offer a satisfactory rationale for why I believe that any form of taxation (as well as any form of theft) is really a form of enslavement.  And in my mind, slavery is one of the worst crimes imaginable.  I need to try to explain this in a way to get through to Steve, because he isn’t buying the argument.  Taxation is a means by which the government extracts money from the citizens to use in whatever way they see fit.  The government cannot spend one dime without taking that money from another person.  We have all become too comfortable with the concept that the money taken from us was never really ours to begin with.  How many people know how much you pay in taxes?  Do you know your gross pay, or your net?  The missing money isn’t even on your radar, so you don’t really worry about it.    What is your pay?  It represents the time and labor you have traded.  You come into work and produce a product or man a computer, and your employer provides money in exchange for this activity.  Yet, the taxman steps in and takes a chunk of your money, representing your time and labor.    Let’s make it more obvious by changing things a little.  Let’s say Dave travels the town repairing heating and air conditioning units.  At the end of each job, he is handed food, or CDs, or some other good that he wants.  Each time he works, he gets something that meets his needs.  But at the end of every day, he has to go visit one customer and spend a quarter of his day working there.  At the end of that job, he is shoved out the door for no compensation.  He is requires by law to work for this customer every day, without being paid.  He MUST do this because society has said he must give his time without pay.  Society has established ownership over a large chunk of Dave’s life.  The faceless mob is saying that they have the right to own the product of your labor, and you have no choice but to comply.  Is this not slavery?  But you say that as a society, we have decided to accept this.  So therefore it is a happy slavery, one entered into with eyes open and hearts light.  We happily toil for the good of us all, casting aside our individuality for the betterment of the group.    Before I address this, I have to lie out another point.  The most fundamental of human rights is the idea of freedom.  As free men, we answer to no one else when it comes to what we do with our own time and labor.  Provided we do not infringe upon the basic human rights of others, we are free to do whatever we choose.  Being free means not being owned by anyone, including ‘society’.  The mob has no claim on the labor of a free man.  Therefore, while you might say we are laboring for the good of society, that decision has been taken from us.  Collectively, we vote for representatives who then decide to tax us for whatever program might be popular.  However, if a man votes that he does not wish to contribute his labor towards a particular thing, his wishes are ignored should the mob decide to support the taxation.  The man’s right to own himself has been taken from him, and a burden is placed on his labor.  Suddenly, Dave has to work a little longer for the non-paying customer, regardless of Dave’s desire to do so.  The only just system taxes the willing.  Those that vote to tax themselves should be taxed.  Those that chose to be free, should be free.  You might complain that under such a system, no programs will be funded, and no one would ever be taxed.  I answer by saying YES.  That is the goal.  People should be free to determine for themselves where their money should be spent.  Should a man choose to hand 20% of his money to PBS, he is free to do so.  Should another man decide to invest his money in a new business that is his decision as well.  Only by the free choice of free men, we can have a just society.    The very concept of a majority vote enslaving the unwilling is anathema to my beliefs.  What is wrong with the prospect that self-ownership cannot be taken away?  Why do we accept that 50% + 1 vote has the right to consign us to work for the non-paying customer?    For the ‘good of society’?  For the benefit of all?  Again, who owns you? Are you an individual or are you a part of a group?  I submit that we all can do more for society by pursuing our own self interests.  Any takers on that debate?  Any form of taxation to support a program that you do not agree with is slavery.  Pure and simple.  If you state that this is a necessity of life, then all I ask is for you to admit that slavery itself is a necessary evil.  Acknowledge that the fundamental premise of taxation policy is no better than 17th century slavery.
