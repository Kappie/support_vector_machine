I would even be happy to see all of last year's bi-polar seniors, as the manic moments were simply brilliant.   Feh, perhaps I'm not the best one to speak of this. I actually got asked to WPA, and we're getting sushi! I love sushi, as the raw fish is most conducive to running up my date's credit card - at least in a cost per pound ratio.   I should probably understand some amount of low feeling, what with all the death going around. Eighteen year olds or the parent of a teenager shouldn't die/be killed. That ain't cool. On a somewhat serious note, I probably should feel bad that I don't feel worse.  Awww yea...there's that sweet, cheerless, bleak, desolation. Where's my lithium! If  don't even myself out I'll start feeling better that I'm not taking pills - and if all the cool kids feel shitty, I want to too.  (Author's Note:[serious] Humor is a method of dealing with pain and any death truly is a tragedy. Though I did not know them personally, their lives affected those who in turn affect me, making it close enough to hit home. [/serious])
