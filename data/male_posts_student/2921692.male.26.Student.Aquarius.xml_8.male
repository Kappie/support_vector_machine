My father, who is not so young himself (*1927), told me, if he would be in the state of my grandmother he would rather like to have a poison pill. That's all so sad. I don't want to see my grandma anymore because I like the memorys I have about her and I am afraid to destroy them.   Second:  On wednesday called me C. She is a nice young girl. I was a bit surprised. It is true I tried to reach her once in the past, but I just caught her brother who was quite rude. I told him my name and sayed I would call later again. I didn't. But I also didn't expect him to tell her that I called. And plus I didn't expect her to call at all.  We want to go dancing next week.   Third:  Yesterday a few old friends of mine and me met at the "La Batea" and had a few drinks together because Florian went today with his girlfriend for a short trip to Paris. Lucky bastard.  Martin says: "Viel Spaß, Flo. Mach' viele Photos. Und genieß mit Pamela die Stadt der Liebe ;-)" The waitress at the "La Batea" went today to Barcelona, like she told me yesterday. Happy her. She is a nice girl. I like her much. ¡Buen viaje!   Fourth:  The last two days I spend at the home of my parents. My first ex-girlfriend is home-sitting their house and we talked a lot about evrything. I liked it a lot. I didn't see her for years. Life is strange. Good old girl.
