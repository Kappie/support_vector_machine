Ok, so it goes like this that i finally found out what i meant to Kelly and the truth behind everything from Kelly. Thanks Kelly for being honest with me and i guess, i wish that it was known before all these happened than things wouldn't have been this hard and complicated, but at least, that's done and over with now. However, i hope that you understand whatever i've said in my mail to you and that hey, your happiness really does matter to me. Hopefully, this whole episode won't change our friendship cause it matters alot to me.  Cherie, i guess, there really isn't anything that i can say anymore except that you've got to trust me now. Certainly i guess, with all these, it's going to be hard, but i pray for you faith. Yeah, so well, thanks for being there for me even during this whole period of confusion and reassuring me that things would eventually work out and that i would be able to make some decisions in the end. Well, all i can say is that, right now, i just wish that we get to know each other better before anything really happens lah.  But i guess, with all these statements, it is clear what i've decided. It hasn't been easy, it has been really hard. One decision that continued to cause turmoil in my heart and mind but certainly one that i won't change now. So yeah...  To all my friends that have been there, thanks. To God most importantly, thank You for being the ultimate friend and everything to me. Yup, i can't say much else now, cause, of the reflections and many things that occupy my mind, but at least now, this whole thing is more or less behind me and i've got to move on.  Take care everyone! Keep smiling! Especially to Kelly, do take care and hope that we'll be friends forever! Cherie, you really got to take care of yourself ok? i am really worried about you, please take care! Smile and hey, be joyful! If you need anything, i am always here for you (this applies to everyone else too)! ;p
