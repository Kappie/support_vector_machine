AffecTs me alot...it will, I guess. This may very well mark the end of something buiLt over years. Something I want to see go on, insTead of just stopping in its tracks and  shattering.               So, then...I do hope that there really is no link between these bLogs...I do hope so. eRmz...if...you know, you'rE reading this, I really hope you two...you know, sort things ouT?
