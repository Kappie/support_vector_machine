I got this and my other blogs because I've put a link to Midnight Delusions on this page. Maybe one day, it'll connect to Midnight Delusions. That would be so great!!! Isn't that how search engines work? They connect and connect from one site to the next through links? Boy! I sure do hope Midnight Delusions gets into Yahoo and Google! Ang saya-saya!!!
