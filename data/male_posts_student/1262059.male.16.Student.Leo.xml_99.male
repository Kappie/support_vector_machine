She went giggly tracing ashes over people's forehead. oo;; ah wellll... let'see, this OAC was talking about the pointlessness of all this.. the ceremony.. the church.. personally i agreed that all the ceremonies and symbols were pointless... but it didn't seem right to voice it out in a catholic school ^^;;   Hotdogs are good... what have you against hotdogs? oo;; i got sandwich for lunch... and 2 boxes of juice... now there's a surprise... ^^;; eh..heh...   Finished reading the Immortals series... if only I have such dedication to my schoolwork as I do to the quartets...^^;;   There are other things, but oh well, don't feel like typing anymore   ~Chronos
