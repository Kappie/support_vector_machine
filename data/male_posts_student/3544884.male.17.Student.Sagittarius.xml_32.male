I dont even have anything to move myself on, my mother doesnt watn to lend me the car, i guess ill have to steal it; maybe at night when everybody is asleep. Now i have to take the keys, ill act like im goign to fix the mirror on the van and ill leave the keys on the keyholder, where they are supposed to be on first place. I wanted to go to Goretti's house, im so bored in here i want to go out and spend money or do something!  I think i got over Candice already, im not sure ill see what happens when i see her. It just that i dont think about her as i used to do, i guess i tried to see what she did and what she does and apparently i dont feel like im losing something anymore, last time i was in the situation to cry for her i didnt, i would say that's progress. Still, i wish i don't get to the point where i dont care for her at all, and its difficult cuase thats how im getting over her, but still i want her to be my best friend, the truth is that right now i dont know if thats going to be possible. Lately i been thinking about this other girls maybe thats why i forget about Candice, one of the girls is really hot but i only think about her on weekend and this other girl i like the way she is, so simple and nice and full of intention to have a good time.   Yesterday Adolfo came! It was cool to see him i missed him a lot, we kept talking for about 3 hours, i mean thats my guess cuase i didnt really have sense of the time. So we talked and we smoked and we recognized several things about life and what comes with it, he had to leave like an our before he left and i wanted to stop talking cuase i was afraid it was to late to call this girl i wanted to talk to. At the end Adolfo left and i didnt call her cause it was too late, but i really wanted to talk to her, the truth is i wasn't sure what i was going to say but i felt like talking and joking with her.  Yesterday, since i had nothing important to do ichecked out from the librarylike six books and a movie, so long, i've only read one chapter of a book called "El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba" by Gabriel Garica Marquez, one of my favorite authors. I hope i finish reading all the books i checked out, none of htem are too long.
