We were always low on ingredients at the bar, because there was never a break in the patronage for us to run to the back and stock up.  Now playing:  The Dropkick Murphys  - The Gauntlent  So last night I went to a BBQ at Ki's with Steff and Abby. Got to hang out with other familiar folks and cool new people there too. Sucking down 8 beers in an hour and a half is um... lovely...   Now playing:  Hot Hot Heat  - Oh, Goddamnit  I've got my Chessmaster 9000 rating up to 780. I'm beating 900 level computer players now. I'm gradually improving my rating.  Ok so to continue on my rant on fat and stupid people. I want to rip on Carl's Jr some more. I've commented on the stupidity of their low carb breakfast bowl, but their low carb chicken sandwich commercials are just absurd. They are basically advertising that their chicken sandwiches (which have bacon on them), can help women lose fat by cutting down the carbs. If people actually believe that eating something with bacon and cheese will help them lose weight, they almost deserve the heart attacks.   It should be noted that people actually do come into the coffee shop and ask about low carb beverages and food.  Now playing:  The Clash  - Should I Stay Or Should I Go?  It's 33 days left until I go back to Binghamton. 15 days until the trip to Vegas.   ***
