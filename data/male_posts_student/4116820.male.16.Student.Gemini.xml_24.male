I usually try to stick to other things about society, politics, media, news, or anything else but myself. But today I feel like shit. (do you get the idea?) I miss Cat, and knowing I have to deal with this stupid fucking party tomarrow at my aunt Heidi's. My moms brother-in-laws family blows so much ass. Not just because there annoying as hell but mainly because they bring their ugly ass dogs. All dogs but mine suck ass. No animals Besides human deserve to live. Oh yeah, the reason I made this title. So now I'm lying in my Basement and feel a little better. The End I hope you all die. Not that anyone but me reads this. Well except Beans and Cat started to the other day. Oh shit now not only is my least favorite movie,  Austin Powers  on but now my mom says I act like Doctor Evil which is partly true because I am evil as clown at AA.
