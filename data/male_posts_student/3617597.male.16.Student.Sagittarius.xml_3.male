Little did i know that she then turned round and practically sed she hated me. So the moral of the story is that you shouldnt help people out and be kind to them if you dont fully trust them. and dont follow your heart if you dont know yourself as well as you would like  Ive nearly done my exams and im happy that very soon (3 more exams) and then ill be free and able to see my friends agian.  anyways ill add some more another time Dave XxXxX
