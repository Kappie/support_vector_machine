Let's start out with the special effects.  I'm the kind of guy who enjoys special effects. I like going to a special-effects heavy movie with a big bag of popcorn and enjoying the eye candy (why do you think Independence Day kicks ass? Because of the plot?). This was my mindset when purchasing my "The Day After Tomorrow" ticket, and I quickly realized that I wasted my money. There was a scene early on where there were several tornados tearing up the streets of LA, and that just looked plumb fake. I'll let you be the judge.   A decade plus a year ago, the movie Jurassic Park made  dinosaur  movements look more real than this. And who the hell knows how a dinosaur moves? Nobody. People have been observing tornadoes for years, and yet I was more conviced that dinos were real in Jurassic Park than the tornados in TDAT (that could be because I was 8 when I first saw JP, but I doubt it). Plus, there was a highly dramatic scene in TDAT in which computer-generated wolves were chasing after our protagonist, Sam Hall, out of a Russain Supertanker parked in the middle of NYC. You read it correctly: wolves were chasing after the main character on a Russian Supertanker that stopped in the middle of a New York City street. Anyways, these wolves looked horrible. On to the plot.  Here is a short summary about TDAT: a second ice age is upon us. But it comes much quicker than anybody could have possibly imagined. Rapidly changing weather patterns are going on all over the world, and in the span of a few days, loe and behold, a new ice age. One of the main characters, Jack Hall, has a son, Sam, who is in New York City playing in some nerdy high school trivia challenge game. He's worried as this area will become encased in ice very quickly, and wants to save his son. Two of his bravest friends join him on his quest to NYC. They drive there, from his comfortable post in Philly, and meanwhile the snow is coming down in hoards and the temperature is well below minus 50 (celsius, because Metric kicks ass). The driver, who was so unimporant that I forget his name, crashes the ugly truck they were planning to get to New York with. So they decide to walk. Walk from Philadelphia to New York City. In cold-ass weather. But hey, he's got a son to save. So they get to New York City after a long time of walking. Unfortunately, one of the party dies, so only two make it to the Public Library in NYC, where Sam and some other people are keeping warm by burning books. And they are all saved by the quick demise of the second ice age. That's the story. Don't even ask how the Russian Supertanker and the wolves played a role in the movie, because I don't even know that myself. Let's not forget all the useless plot elements: a homeless guy teaching all the rich folk how to stay warm, because homeless guys are used to keeping warm during an ice age; a little boy with cancer whose only purpose is to be saved; Sam falling in love with some tramp who leans on his shoulder at the end of the movie, and a bunch of people running away from cold. No lie, people were literally running away from the ice age. And how about everybody gripping metal with their bare hands in ice age weather and not having their skin stick to it at all? Dumb.  Because of the love interest between Sam and that tramp, whose name was Laura (I had to use imdb to figure out her name, I didn't memorize it) Sam and his crew had to go on the Russian Supertanker parked in the middle of NYC and be chased by fake-looking wolves, and then run away from the creeping ice age. And I could have gone without seeing that desecration to all that is good in movies.
