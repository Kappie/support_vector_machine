We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #5: The Trak Starz (Zo and Sham)    000000000    Write Up  Extremely new to the rap game, the Trak Starz produced most of  Chingy’s  savory ’03 debut,  Jackpot,  and went on to become popular for danceable hits with crossover Southern flavor. Nonexistent before that Chingy release, soon gained critical and social success for their work, dropping three top ten singles along the way to guarantee future success. The ’03-’04 hip-hop era seemed the perfect time for their work, as young hipsters looked more to  Ludacris  than  Nas  for hits, begging for more of that rabble-rousing, “I’ll-drink-to-that” production, a sound that the Trak Starz have conveniently mastered. That rise in party-hard Southern rap may be the only reason that the twosome is able to dominate the charts, and it is fair to equate their lifespan to the length of the genre’s popularity, but hitting hip-hop trends at the right time is nothing to be humiliated by (hell,  Rubin  did it with the  Beastie Boys  in ’86,  Dre  did it with  Snoop  in ’93, and  Diddy  did it with  Biggy  in ’95). If anyone can continue the success of today’s radio rap, it seems to be the Trak Boyz, even if each of their productions sound cut, edited and shipped from the same exact spot in the same exact recording studio. They introduced us to Chingy, a fine replacement for the slowly-fading  Nelly , and now  Houston , a fine second-stringer in the newer  McDonalds  commercials (who may finally cause the drop of that fucking “I’m lovin’ it” loop). So while playing up a new urban era, the Trak Starz are also reinventing past stars as not to step too far into the future and leave old-school fans behind. You could call them one hit producing wonders, but they’re not. You could call them cliché-riders, but they’re not (entirely). You could call them  Grammy -less, which they are, and it looks as if it will stay that way until they really find some standing room of their own. For now, the pair seems content with pumping out hits that, while lacking in diversity, are packing in likeability, a go-to game-plan that won’t fail until radio changes directions.   Career Highlights (followed by  Billboard charting )   Right Thurr - Chingy   (#2)  Some funky organ work and a little sound effect spice was all that the slur-crazy Chingy needed to turn “Right Thurr” into a #2  Billboard Hot 100  hit, at the same time almost guaranteeing himself future success in the rap world. Purposely trading “there” for “thurr,” so absurdly drawled that it came dangerously close to an all-out stereotype, Chingy’s overly performed chorus matched the overly partying backdrop for an irresistible trance jam, all the while never sounding like anything that should be let above South Carolina geographically. More over there than over here, more Southurrn than Southern, the  Trak Starz  hit crossover success with a single that was little more than Chingy’s borderline-perverted comments about some honeys from afar.   Holidae Inn - Chingy feat. Ludacris and Snoop Dogg   (#3)  Above all else, “Holidae Inn” proves that three is one hell of a crowd. You’ve got  Snoop Dogg , the limber-lipped pimp who was tried for murder,  Ludacris , whose first radio single promoted “ruff sex [to] make it hurt,” and  Chingy , a sly newcomer who we’re sure would be up for a drive-by or a gang-bang (not necessarily in that order). The single, backed by some octave-dropping funk buzzes and a steady club stomp, absolutely killed radio (Snoop?) and molested video countdowns (Luda?) all across America. Peaking at #3 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , the hip-hop trio milked the “shizzle” fad in Ludacris’s show-stealing guest rap and invited any and all ladies to their nearest inn for a check-in with hotel clerk Snoop Dogg. The  Trak Starz  perfectly played a rollicking party beat for anyone willing to dance along, dropping the best rhythm throughout Chingy’s debut,  Jackpot . Ultimately, this was the best song in 2003 to rape and murder to.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Potential Grammy Material)   One Call Away - Chingy feat. J. Weav   (#2)  With  Jackpot,  Chingy was able to pioneer his own  Nelly  renaissance, matching that rapper’s  Country Grammar  success single for single, almost to an exact science. Chingy’s lead single, “Right Thurr,” schooled clubbers in down-South rhetoric much like  Nelly’s  “Country Grammar,” and his “Holidae Inn” followed in suit like  Nelly’s  “E.I.,” both holla-back funk jams to milk a newfound ego in the rap game. Then Chingy released “One Call Away” in early 2004, the drawl-heavy sequel to  Nelly’s  “Ride Wit Me,” which first used an acoustic backbeat in 2001. Not to fall short of “Ride Wit Me”’s #3 charting, “One Call Away” hit the #2 spot (only behind Usher’s untouchable “Yeah!”) on the  Billboard  charts, proving to be Chingy’s best and most commercially successful single from his debut disc. Riding that aforementioned acoustic guitar with electrically programmed drum fills, the  Trak Starz  opened the door to emotions without leaving behind funkiness, perfectly crafting a lovesick hit behind Chingy’s tender delivery.   I Like That - Houston feat. Chingy, I-20 and Nate Dogg   (currently #15)  Ultimately, “I Like That” pushes simplicity. Sizing down  McDonalds'  old ad campaign, you now are drawn into America’s worst diet with “I like that,” not “I’m lovin’ it.” At the same time, this single edits  Chingy’s  “I like the way you do that right thurr” down to its three-word title, once again downsizing the importance of the article, whether the “that” in question is a cheeseburger or a woman’s ass. Frankly, it doesn’t matter what you’re biting into, because the  Trak Starz  backed this 4-man crew with synth horns and cyber chords, creating a pump-up anthem for summer 2004. Last seen in  50 Cent’s  “21 Questions,” the scruffy  Nate Dogg  trades in G-funk for party rap, a genre he hasn’t updated since  Ludacris  and  Nelly’s  “Area Codes.” Sure, you can call it somewhat of a sell-out for immediately going to a  McDonalds  commercial, but struggling rapper Houston needed a break to make it big. Like  Ludacris  did on “Holidae Inn,” Chingy steals the show, enlightening us on the more important aspects of his assets, like his size (“This 12 inches, it’ll cost ya”). Ooh, I like that.
