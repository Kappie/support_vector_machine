The opening band, I'm a Robot, sucked. The lead singer of the band is 80s rock meets Canadian rock band. Every song they played, the lead singer would take off an article of his clothing. I'm telling ya, near the end of their performance he was down to his pants and I was gonna walk out if he took them pants off. I mean, the guy wasn't the most atractive guy in the world.  Once the opening act was done, to pass the time they played old Betty Boop and Little Audrey cartoons on the big screen. Everyone liked it, but after the second or third cartoon it was getting real old real fast. They ended up playing like 10 cartoons. It was torturous knowing that The White Stripes were next, but we're stuck whatching Little Lulu cartoons.  As far as songs go, The White Stripes played all of my favorite songs. What caught me off guard was the fact that they played more of their old stuff and that people knew the old songs. I tought I was the only one who listened to their old albums over and over again. Even thou they didn't play much of Elephant, they did play the two great guitar songs;  "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,"  and  "Ball and Biscuit."  The solos for "Ball and Biscuit" are dope. It was great, the opening song,  "The Big Three Killed My Baby,"  Jack White broke and string, therefore he played that song with five strings and three fingers (he had a slide on his pinkie). And I respected the fact that he recited lyrics to Johnny Cash's  "I've Got Stripes."  I guess it was better than reciting lyrics to the cover of "Hurt" or the song "Ring of Fire."  This time I give the concert a whomping *****!!! The only complaint I had was the fact that it seemed as if the opening act performed longer than The White Stripes. Other than that it was the best concert I've ever been to in my life! Good luck to Adam!
