Rare  Very rare. Not many people know it but I'm an insomniac. So it was a good thing really.  Saturday was beautiful though. I stayed over at Annas (heya my gorgeous German darling of a scandal) and watched this kick ass film called basketball diaries with Leonardo Di Caprio, who I know gets much flack for his lack of presence, but God he played it well. Anyway after that spent the time until about 5 in the morning talking, hugging and "foot fondling" (yay we inventned it) and I told her I loved her, which I still do, right to this day. I'd die for that girl if I had to, and I just wish one day she was mine. Maybe one day.  nehoo - just a message to the rival hell like enemy blog from Mortlake - I'll get you back dammit grrrrr with a wonderfully god liek plague of net locusts onto your blog (-:
