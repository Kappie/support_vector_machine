I went to the University of Arkansas summer band/orchestra camp (politically titled Music Camp) for five years.  The camps were large, with 100 people in each band and orchestra, and anywhere from five to sometimes nine ensembles, totaling nearly 1000 people.  We took up two wings of Pomfret Hall, an athletic dorm near Bud Walton Arena and on the west side of campus (which means nothing...I don't think the U of A is divided into segments, and if it is, who gives a shit?)    The student leaders of the camp were known as captains; they were brown-nosers of the highest order, folks on half scholarship to the camp who worked as proxies for the couneslors.  Their job was to knock on our doors in the mornings, and yell LIGHTS OUT at lights out!  However, every day one of the dorm rooms would be qualified as an exemplary room, and was given a 30 minute extension.  The extension had a specific name, but it was hokey and only worth remembering for the purpose of wishing you could forget.    For four years I toiled with roommates.  Kyle McNitt, Daniel Young, and Jerromy Falk all shared a room with me, sitting up into the late hours of the night (sometimes past midnight!), quietly talking about girls, sports, girls, or girls.  "You don't know what it's like when you're just inches away," a wisened Jerromy offered to me during the Summer of 1996.    And for four years, no sign of the late lights (maybe that was the name.  I hope it was something better, stupider, more regal and pomp-driven).  We'd come close...a room next to us, a room down the hall, but never us.  And it always sucked that it wasn't us.  Every night I would bemoan not having the extra half-hour, wishing on the farthest star that the counselors would bestow upon us the honor and priviledge of the extra wattage.    It was a Thursday in 1997 when I got the news.  We had two days of camp left, and the last night was traditionally a lax night, so late lights would end on Thursday.  I sat on the tile floor, listening to Robert Bright oratote the afternoon meeting, and Joe Raybourn pass out the mail.  Then came the yell for the two rooms with late lights.  116 and 324.    We were 324.    Inside, I smiled.  Five years of perseverance and good behavior paid off on the last day of all days, the penultimate night where I could finally revel in my glory and enjoy an extra half-hour of rambunctions actions and folly with Mr. Falk.    The time came.  10:28.  10:29.  10:29 and 30 seconds.  Jerromy and I waited paitently for the call...  LIGHTS OUT!    We kept ours on.  WE KEPT OURS ON!    10:31.    We kept ours on!    10:32  We kept ours on!  10:33  What the fuck is there to do?    Thus, the dilemma of ages:  when all of your friends go to bed at 10:30, and you have to be quiet for them, but you can stay up until 11, why would you stay up until 11?    I think we left the lights on until 11, but only as a matter of principal.  The 30 minutes sucked.
