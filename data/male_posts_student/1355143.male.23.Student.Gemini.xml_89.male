Its actually the bank whitch is in the same house as the one I used to work.  Im not really sure what Im suppose to do but its propably interesting and I think Im going to manage a portfolio for a retirement fund... not sure though. So I guess all of us are going to work in a bank next summer. The name od this post is mostlikly my new email which I dont like exept for the ending:D The owner of the bank is a big football fan and we support the same team in Iceland (remember the black and white stripe shirt... that one) so if Im having problems I just go and chat with him about the starting line up.  There isnt really muc going on I finished my tests the 20th and started working on this project in the following. We are making strategy for Icelands biggest golf club (and Europes 5th biggest) and its been realy fun. Its an actual consulting work so I we arent just doing this for the teacher, this will be used. There are bigger companies around (which other groups have) but we are making a strategy for the whole club, some groups only have one department or something like that.    Well thats it for know, Úlli
