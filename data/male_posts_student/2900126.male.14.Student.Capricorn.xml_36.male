Well anyway I had a dream last night, and it was high school graduation and everybody was getting stuff ready for it. After that was graduation time. We all graduated and stuff. Then LinZ had a speech that she messed up and or something, i'm not even sure if it was a speech, because she was using an over-head projector. Yeah and then after the ceremony nobody cried or anything, we all just went on with our lives, well I don't know but maybe in my dream they skipped that part of something. But after the graduation Linz was teaching. And I was like just looking up school or something or a form came in the mail or something, I don't remember. And the college that came in the mail or whatever was in Maryland, Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. Then I took like a road trip or something to Maryland to see the school and my sister Alicia was there and she was still the age she is now and so was Anthony (my cousin). Then I started walking and they kinda sorta vanished but not like ran off or kidnapped or anything just like if my mom where to pick them up and take them back to Illinios. But than as I was walking I met the dude I don't know if it was Ryan Seacrest or somebody, but they were famous and it was like they were one of my friends (weird I know). And we were just walking and talking and stuff to me this part was weird. but yeah.                                                                                  Chichi I hope we can keep it touch while you're in NJ, I really do because if anything happens there I want you to be able to talk to me about. SO yeah and you will be miss chichi.
