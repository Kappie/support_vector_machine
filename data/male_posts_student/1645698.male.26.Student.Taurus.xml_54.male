And he's *teaching* me stuff. . . okay, so he's really not, and it's incredibly minor stuff, but that's all right.  I *think* the kitten's a boy . . .I'm not sure.  It's happier, though - now if I could catch it, we'd be set.  Of course, now I'm afraid to try and then to fail and then all the effort I've put in will have gone to waste.  So yeah, I'm panicked and not trying right now.  Tomorrow.  I'll try tomorrow.  *frowns*  Maybe?  Other than that things are going along.  Ooooh!!! I *finally* have rollerblades!!!  I have rollerblades - and they're silver and purple and I have wrist pads and they're so cool!!  I'm just thrilled . . .and probably sounding like an idiot.  I'll leave you now - go look at Mars tonight.  And stupid White Flag song by Dido . . does she have a funny pitched voice, or is it just me?   XOXO
