He more than likely did not go home and research that about Sanger and made his comment solely based on her invention.  Now, as you said, the feminist movement was essentially an attempt to make men and women more equal. And as you said, one of the ways they were made more equal was when it came to sexual promiscuity. One of the great things about this country though, is that everyone one is guaranteed equality of opportunity. If half the population can be sexually promiscuit [?], why can't the other half? Also, not just people who are sexuall promiscuit [?] use birth control. There could be a thousand other reasons why they do. Perhaps a young, married couple aren't financially ready to have children. What should they do? Have 5 kids and then go on welfare and not go to colledge and be stuck in the underclass for the rest of their life? They could use their birth control and get through colledge and not be a drag on society.
