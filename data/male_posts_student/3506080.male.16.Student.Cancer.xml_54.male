With the new applet you can scroll around and zoom in and out with ease. The applet also contains all the new areas that have been discovered in RuneScape, including Mort Myre Swamp and Death Plateau! Saving the best to last, clicking items in the key highlights their placement on the map - helping you locate all sorts of useful places much faster.   Death Plateau Quest     Trolls have come down from the north and are camped on Death Plateau, they are using this base to launch attacks on the principality of Burthorpe! The Imperial Guard is taking heavy losses, they need your help!  If you are in search of adventure speak to Denulth, the leader of the Imperial Guard, in the Burthorpe training camp north of the Hero's Guild and accept the Death Plateau quest!  While this is a quest completable at any level, players with a low combat level should be very cautious or they could come to a sudden and sticky end at the hands of trolls.  This update introduces the town of Burthorpe and a troll area, which is an area that we have plans to expand in future updates with some quests classed in the experienced quests bracket.  We have made some adjustments to the agility arena. More than one person can now go over the low wall at once and it doesn't take as long to use the handholds.  Some colourblind people were struggling with the new strange boxes due to them being fairly transparent, therefore they are now no longer transparent.
