Real Me Lyrics  English  What I get? What you get? It may be an illusion And we may only want to believe That we have got  What I say? What you say? If we don't express Our thoughts and feelings in words They may not be understood nor reach  The present time Starts here  A woman never runs away A woman never hides away In order to survive You should not want to be healed Without fighting  A woman never shows her fears A woman never shows her tears In order to survive You should not easily Show your tears to someone  What I need? What you need? Maybe it's all right So long as I have desires And am not satisfied  What I lose? What you lose? Maybe I have heard enough people saying That they knew the value of something Only after losing it  Love It's here  A woman could be dangerous A woman could be generous In order to survive We cannot always be So good girls  A woman could be having fun A woman could be like a nun In order to survive We cannot be kind to others Before we know pain  A woman never runs away A woman never hides away In order to survive You should not want to be healed Without fighting  A woman never shows her fears A woman never shows her tears In order to survive You should not easily Show your tears to someone  A woman could be dangerous A woman could be generous In order to survive We cannot always be So good girls  A woman could be having fun A woman could be like a nun In order to survive As I know You see the real me      Romanji  What I get? What you get? Te ni shiteru mono wa Shinjitai dake de Gensou nano kamo na  What I say? What you say? Kotoba ni shinakucha Tsutawarenai kamo ne Todokanai kamo ne  Koko kara Ima ga hajimaru  a woman never runs away a woman never hides away in order to survive Tatakai mo sezuni Iyashi motomeru mon janai  a woman never shows her fears a woman never shows her tears in order to survive Namida wa tayasuku Dareka ni miseru mon janai  What I need? What you need? Yokubou ga atte Mitasarenai uchi wa Daijoubu kamo ne  What I lose? What you lose? Nakushite hajimete Kizuitada nante Kiki akita kamo ne  Ai nara Koko ni arukara  a woman could be dangerous a woman could be generous in order to survive Sonna ni itsudemo Ii KO bakari de irarenai  a woman could be having fun a woman could be like a nun in order to survive Itami wo shiranakya Yasashiku nante irarenai  a woman never runs away a woman never hides away in order to survive Tatakai mo sezuni Iyashi motomeru mon janai  a woman never shows her fears a woman never shows her tears in order to survive Namida wa tayasuku Dareka ni miseru mon janai  a woman could be dangerous a woman could be generousU in order to survive Sonna ni itsudemo Ii ko bakari de irarenai  a woman could be having fun a woman could be like a nun in order to survive honto no watashi wa Anata ga mite de kureru kara
