That site is that good, people, and now, with the help of Maven Technologies and Microsoft's Windows Media Hi-Definition, Atom Films presents a new download for you, absolutely free: Atom Films Hi-Def.  This allows you to watch your favorite Atom Films on your computer, in beautiful, almost DVD-Quality format.  And it looks good, too...but, is it worth the download?  Yes and no.  Why?  Yes because you can see your favorite Atom Films, like Angry Kid and others, in beautiful streaming Hi-Def.  No, because the films take an eternity to download, which kills the purpose of having it.  In order to use Atom Films Hi-Def, you need to get the Maven Technologies thingy, which is like a TV on the interweb, and you can download different "channels" to view.  Atom Films Hi-Def is one of the biggest ones, and, it's a good channel, but, with the downloads taking forever, it makes it a little bad.  You get a certain amount of downloads every week (either 2 or three), and if you refer people to sign up for Atom Films Hi-Def, you get extra ones.  It's a cool system, I'm going to recommend that anyone signs up (refer thebagel05, so I get can some new ones).    If you're a huge fan of AtomFilms, like me, then you definitely want to check this out, because it's a great service, its free, and the content is unbelievable.  The quality is so good, you're going to want more and more of the same!   Pros  +Near DVD Quality Content Straight on your computer! +Free +Easy to Use   Cons  -Downloads take a while. -Only allowed 2 or 3 downloads every time new movies come in.   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 100%-A Speed: 85%-B Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  96.25%-A Gold    Up Next: Today's Video of the Day, "Strong Bad Email: Cheatday."
