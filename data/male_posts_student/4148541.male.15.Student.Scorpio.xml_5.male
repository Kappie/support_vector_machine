I get the entire upstairs maybe :)  I will attach pictures ASAP! We can't move in until AT LEAST the 24'th when our furniture clears customs (marujana in the couch cushions? honestly)  Anyway, its a cool house lots of room.  I found out some game convention is coming to the hotel on saturday I will have my graphics card on Sat or Friday so I can go it seems :) going to meet up with a few guys I met on a Game website at the tournament.  So that will be fun.  Brother is being an asswipe as usual. Bought these stupid toy guns and he totes them around everywhere. He looks like he is part of the Irish Republican army.  He wont even let me touch them I picked them up and he immediete began crying and yelling and hitting me DAMNIT i hate him.  Peace
