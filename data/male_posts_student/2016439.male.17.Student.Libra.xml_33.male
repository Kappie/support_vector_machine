In fact, I had little interest in the subject until we started talking about it in history.  There are so many unresolved issues surrounding his death that my interest was piqued.  Mrs. Istre told our class that there were several specials coming on the History Channel over things like the different conspiracy theories, the actual video of Kennedy being shot, and, as I found out later on, a 3-hour look at John F. Kennedy, the President and the man.  The latter I just finished watching, and I have to say that I am awe-inspired.  I truly think that Kennedy was one of the, if not  the , most incredible and awe-inspiring Presidents of the United States of America.  His story really is a sad one, but I'm glad that I know it now.  I think some of our latter-day Presidents could learn many a thing or two from him, but that's an entirely different rant for another time.  I can say that I am proud to be a part of this country after watching that special, and I eagerly await November 2004 where I can finally voice my opinion in the Presidential election.  How sweet that day will be for me.
