I didn't want to be in this mood, I never like being in this mood, I hate this mood.  I save up all this anger by never getting angry at anyone, and then sumone does sumthing and I hate everything and everyone.  Now my mom is interogating me about why I'm in a bad mood, and she's asking me what a blog is.    FUCK!!!    I was in a perfectly good mood, I was really good in fact, beyond good, and now I just wanna punch a whole in sumthin' or kill sumone.  Ervin wants me to come over at 6 too, well, no way in hell that's gonna happen.  Why do people have to be stupid??? Why can't they just take two fuckin' seconds to think about what the consequences will be????  GET it through their THICK fuckin' skulls that THEY are NOT the most important person in the WORLD?!?!?!?  GOD DAMNIT!!  I wish I had am explosive...then I could blow shit up.  I mean, she just full out kicked me in the balls, I was in tears.  I was literally on the ground crying because it hurt so FUCKING much!    Now I get angry at people who ahve done absolutely nuthin'....FOR NO REASON!!!!  Except for the reason that one person did sumthing wrong...and now I hate everyone and everything.  Which, I'm not so sorry to say at the moment, but will be later, includes whoever is reading this right now...I don't even know who you are, but I hate you....  Then I think about all the other little things that would have made me angry earlier, but I supressed them, and then I get more angry...even just little things.  Even things about people I love...like Keli.  I lose all sight of anything that makes me happy, everything just becomes one large pile of shit to me, a pile of shit I want to burn and then leap on, so I can rid my own head from all this BULLSHIT that people fill it with.  I was perfectly happy less then an hour ago, then it all went away..  Then I get frustrated...because I can't find a swear to explain the anger that I feel right now.... FUCK-OUT!  Spense
