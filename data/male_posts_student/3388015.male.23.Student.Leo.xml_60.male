I had a lovely conversation with the girl downstairs in her living room about Montreal, snow in the northern NY region and other fun things like relationships.  We all then went to Element and danced the night away.  I missed having Laura there, I enjoy dancing with her.  I was a designated driver, so I didn't drink.  I kinda wished I could drink, get drunk and have fun.  However, Cindy made fun of the way I dance and after awhile I just sat in the corner and waited for the night to end.  It did, but wait, we went to taco bell first.  The drunk guy in the backseat was really funny.  But then I dropped off people at the right houses and went back to my cat at my apartment.  It was 3am by the time I fell asleep and I wanted to get up at 7:30am to go garage sale-ing at 8.  Sadly, I awoke at 8am to my cell, a call from my sister.  They wanted to know where I was, since they were there and I was going to meet them.  Sigh.  So I went back to bed for awhile, then got up and let Cindy know I was picking her up shortly.  She didn't argue with that.  She was up way too early to have gone to bed, so I knew this was going to be a long day for her.  I don't know how she does it.  But we shopped from 9am to 3pm.  It was a lot of fun.  I bought a bunch of great stuff.  However, a couple items I wanted I couldn't get so I guess I'll have to keep my eye open.  Some items of interest: 40 AA batteried for $1.50  Clock radio for $1.  UPS power backup for $5.  A nice bike rack for $8.  A steal indeed.  Cindy and I both got burned a bit on the face and she got burned on her shoulders.  I stopped by Office Depot and picked up the blank DVDRs that Luke had got for me with his discount.  He bought me 50 for $40.  Not bad at all!  We came back to the apartment and watched TV forever.  Laura called and invited us to see Connie  Carla.  We went and saw it at Movies 10.  It was really good.  I'm amazed at how often I disagree with the movie critics on yahoo.com  The cat thinks my candy dish is her personal food bank. She keeps taking candy and playing with it all across the room.  She also has the awful habit of trying to eat anything anyone is eating.  Laura left, Cindy left to play with her drunk friends and I'm playing with the cat.  I'm making breakfast for everyone in the morning, plus we're going to Darien Lake all day tomorrow.  Should be fun!
