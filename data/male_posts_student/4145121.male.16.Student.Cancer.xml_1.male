I reported in sch as usual at ard 0630hrs and everything was in place, so the sec4 band members tried out our military outfits as the rest of the band went to set up the entire band at the track. Everything was still normal at that time, till we realised there was only 1 sash, when we needed 4 for the 4 band leaders...so my fellow smart band major came up with the solution to borrow it from the National Cadet Corps (Land) and so we did. Then...my fellow sec4 image head Ketsu came along and told us that our conductor was pissed. Oh yea...that was lyk...oooosh. It's supposed to be a good day u noe...and when my conductor turns to PMS mode...things ain't gd. So we went to face the music. Surprisingly...she was only mad at Ketsu and the Sec3 leaders...which I felt pretty bad about. I was a band leader afterall and no matter what, I should join in the punishment. And so the few of them was punished as the rest of us went back to our places. The performance went well and tt's the last time I'm playing with my fellow trombonist Weiqi. From now on, he's on his own and he'll be using my buddy fer 2 yrs - my Vincent Bach Tenor Trombone. That rusty piece of shit has been with me fer 2 yrs or so already but damn I love that instrument. It's been with me thru the gd and bad times...lyk when the dumb trigger broke during the SYF period and when we had the two successful concerts at the Esplanade. After that, two NCC heads came and said that they needed their sashes back. Apparently, their teacher in charge is realli pissed about it. Our yea, I was pissed too. Like...what the hell?! Since they decided to lend it, then just lend us all the freakin way then! But of course I returned it to them nicely. Afterwards...at around 0950hrs... I received news that apparently Ketsu's Service Award has been taken away. Oh yea. That's way too much. Lyk...which fucker would do something lyk that?! So what if he made a last minute mistake?! All the things he's done in the past is nothing huh?! It's god damned screwed up I tell you. Obviously Ketsu's shattered and when we realised it was the condutor that took it, we tried to call her, and yes, she DID NOT pick up. Bet she thinks she's bigger than the school. So later, all other 7 receipients got our awards but not Ketsu. He will get his award behind the scenes I suppose. Most receipients just got quite alotta cheers but weirdly...I had lower sec students shouting my name. Weird. And my dude Joachim received his award fer the Students Council too. Yes, I am ashamed of his being an EXCO in the band, for always being late and stuff. But on the other hand, I must admit, I've failed him as his Drum Major. After a whole year and I still can't help him change.     Ya huh... this is one of those rare times when I am extremely disappointed in myself. Yea...I'm sorry dude cauz I failed you too. After the whole thing...out teacher in charge talked to us and I thought it was gonna be a hell lotta scolding. But he didnt do that...he just spoke to us on several issues and thank goodness that didnt ruin our mood cauz he's just THE MAN. Haha...Mr Heng rox, big time. Oh well, we played soccer later and tried to cheer Ketsu up. He's a strong guy but I really feel bad fer him. Oh well...I'm done with lunch. Time to go mug in bed...inflamed throat not well yet afterall...ooosh.
