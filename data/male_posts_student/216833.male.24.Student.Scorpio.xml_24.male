I had spent some time online researching different sites to find books that I thought might help us come up with some ideas and maybe show us new ways to organize the group to get stuff done. mimi was sick with the cold, so I left her at home, crying and sniffling on the couch.  The  urlLink library  is only a few blocks down the street, behind an Exxon and a dry-cleaners, so it was a short dash to my local branch.    The library was packed with people, but here, the books are the majority and most of the time I would rather take a book with me than a person.  People are to edgy sometimes, and they have problems that they always seem to bring to your front door.  I don't know why, but I'm always greeting strangers on the street with a 'Hello" and "Hey" followed by some sort of nod.  I found my self doing this as I was walking into the library and going, "wtf!" I don't know that person, why do I give a flying fuck enough to say "Hello."  Fuck that guy for making me feel weak and habitual, and now I am saying "Fuck your self for blaming your weak ass on some stranger!"    weird...I had a small fight inside my head..........am I crazy??  I'm crazy, fuck you!   I got my books, and went to check them out and they had some nice calendars sitting on the counter...FREE....wow these are nice.  I picked up two, one for my house and one for the office(a.k.a. the life I am to weak to abandon.)
