This is rather funny though: Dickybod, during the course of the past 2 years has been in my english class, and had not been doing his essays. Tut tut. A sensible person like me did the essay as soon as we finished the topic in class, so that all the good information was fresh in my mind. But Dickybod... Well. He did one essay in good time - the creative writing one, but left all the others until the night before, amazingly foolish. 4 essays in one night. As you can immagine, he didn't get them done. So, Thursday's English lesson came, Mr Herbert walks up to our desk, 'Look, Richard, I reeeeealy need these essays in, have you got them...?' 'Errr, well I stayed up late last night and did 2 of them by hand, and my writing isn't very legible... if I could just have one more day...' 'Yeh, ok Richard, but I reeealy must have those in tomorrow' 'Yep, sure sir, definately tomorrow'. Well, the next day, Friday came, and all looked good. Dickybod had remembered his essays and handed them in first thing in the morning. We thought it was all over, but the terror would come back to haunt us again. Well, not us. I don't care about his essays. Over the weekend, dickybod found one essay that had somehow escaped his schoolbag on friday morning. He had forgotten one essay. Dun dun duhhhh. And which one was it? The Psycho one of course!     This was bad, especially as the essays were being moderated first thing monday morning. Well, this morning at break, dickybod handed the one remaining essay in. And that was that. No shouting, no detention. Sir was fine with it. Pity.. I wanted some action. Oh well. I've resorted to talking about other peoples lives now, as my life is so amazingly boring. Boring day. Nothing to say. Bye all.   Playing:  Nothing  Listening To:   Star Wars CD  Watching:  Nothing  Annoyed With:  Nothing really  Confused About:  Nothing really  Mood:  Normal. What a normal day.
