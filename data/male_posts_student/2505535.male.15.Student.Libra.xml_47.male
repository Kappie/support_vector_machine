I got a migrane yesterday, so didn't do much but sleep or lounge around, and today hasn't been much different, but for some reason I woke up really early (well, early for a sunday at least)  And now I have Alpha Centauri, it downloaded at last, but now I'm just waiting for the expansion pack to download so I can be an alien race, heh.  Oh, and if you haven't seen it yet, check out the flame war type thing in the comments from my last post. Yeh, thanks to those who were on my side, that's really everyone who posted, minus the lone knob-end. Well, 'nuff on that, don't want to start another one.
