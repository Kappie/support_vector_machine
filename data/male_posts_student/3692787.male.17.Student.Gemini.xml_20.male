"We must take our leave, child. We have given you long enough." he sat up silently, his eyes poised at the distant skyline. he ran his hand over his heart again for just a second, and again his companion spoke. "You were instructed to deal with this matter. I must say, I am disappointed." without looking at the one who spoke, he muttered, "...I'll be fine." "This can not be allowed to continue, child. Your condition has left you weak." slowly, he turned to face his companions. he merely cracked them a smile. "Has it?" "So be it, child, but remember, everyone, including her, will suffer if you fail..." "...that's not going to happen." he blurted out. his tone had not changed, but his eyes turned fiery red in anger, his stare piercing the hearts of the men whom he addressed, the others merely looking at him in bewilderment. he soon regained his composure and his eyes had returned to their usual self--empty, dazed, and looking a million miles away. "Come now, we've wasted enough time." he stood up while the others slowly walked away from him. he soon caught up and they all made their way towards the huge precipice that was swallowing the stars from the sky. he could only think of her at this time, but it was all right, for she did not weaken him anymore. he muttered softly to himself, "This is who I am, and that will not change, not for her, not for anyone... We all just have to live with that..."  completely wrong thought of the day: i can't take it anymore. someone please give me a lobotomy, please make me forget the horror... my eyes, my mind, my soul, my senses have been raped by this abomination, this twisted, foul fruit of the fiery depths of the underworld. oh what a cruel, cruel encephalon chose to spawn so evil a sensation that it would make the most valiant and courageous examples of our great race cringe at the mere sight of it? oh please, please make it stop, make it stooooopppp!!!!!  four words: "smile mo, kita ko!" again, "smile mo, kita ko!"  AAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! will somebody please think of the children??!? the horror! THE HORROR!!!!!
