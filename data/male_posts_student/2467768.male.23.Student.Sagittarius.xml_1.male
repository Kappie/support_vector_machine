I just received an sms from Juli, wishing me be strong ... I really appreciated. And Liza, trying to find a person to drive her to the airport. As much as I wannt to see her off at the aiport, but I can't. I am still stuck with the last jargon.   And this is the first time, I study all alone without my mom or dad's actually support. Man, stop the Sudirman's song.. I know .. not now .. later, day of tomoro .. Dunn need to remind of my folks....  there's is a lil boy still at the corner of greenacre road,   he's been sitting down there all week long, he is studying hard, knock to the ground,  and he start to say, still studying for the last paper ....  what about me .....  while i pass this time  so listen , what about me .. nobody change, and i feel cold and lone... and i guess i luckly , some i ask for more ... WHAT ABOUT ME ....  What about me .....  No mom's cooking, no daddy's wise words... All alone studying thru the lates nites ....
