After emptying my head onto paper I feel a need for something else, some physicality. The body needs to release itself too. There are two things that spring to mind: hardcore drinking or hardcore fucking. I got no one to fuck and don't feel like hitting on the easy white trash. I don't got booze but I could get booze, just down the street here's my money thank you very much come again, but no, no, I have an assignment due tomorrow, gotta do that instead.   But I can't sit still, there's an unreleased energy that requires massive consumption, I need to make my head dizzy with sex and drugs, to feel something not just think something. Argh, this sucks.   It's a good thing I'm not as amoral as I'd like to be or else I'd turn into a cokehead serial rapist come exam time.    UPDATE 30 Minutes Later    Found a box chocolates in the kitchen. Playing Tetris on my Gameboy whilst shoving my face full of delicious (plus a couple tall glasses of milk) and listening to  urlLink Forward  by the Thermals on repeat seems to have been all the stimulation my body required.   I'll just do that instead of making a rape joke next time.
