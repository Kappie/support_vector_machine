I don't know what to do about it I just love kids. On a Friday night some guys may ask me to go to the movies or to a party and I say "I'm working." Even If a girl asks me I try to push it to Saturday night so it's not in the way. I say I'm working but I it's not like work. It's like enjoying the company of these sweet kids. They make me feel better after a long day. I need kids. I don't know how to juggle teaching and fencing, I thought about other jobs but I love those kids too much. But then again missing the beginning of fencing hasn't been that bad sue to the fact that mer isn't there. She supposed to be there on Tuesday but the thing is I don't think she knows about the whole 5$ thing. I'll have to figure something out with the Kids. One of the greatest feelings is walking down the street and a student stops and waives at me yelling, "Hi Sensei Greg." I smile back and they walk along with their parent. My Sensei reminded me that they all look up to me and some wish to be me. Even Omar, He started after me and is a first degree. It feels weird calling him Sensei Omar but it makes feel good to know I helped him get there, Oh and I can't forget out of all of my students. The elite. The Jr. Blackbelts, My apprentice, the one I took under my wing is in fact the most feared 11 year old fighter in the nation. He's a beast. I don't know how much I'm going to miss it when I leave but hey it will always be here.
