I didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be okay, with just the right balance of people I know and those I don't. One thing pissed me off a little though...  So I'm sitting in a reasonably empty room, a beer in my hand and one of the girls sitting on a nearby sofa goes off somewhere, leaving her friend there alone. I like the look of her, so in I go, sit down and start chatting to her. She's friendly, good looking, takes almost all the subject I take and seems to have the same attitude as me towards a lot of stuff. Great, I think, and carry on talking. The room fills up a bit and it's obvious that people have started to notice us talking. I carry on though, until I have to excuse myself to go to the bathroom.  I come back and she's gone off somewhere, but now my friends are saying to me, "get in there, she really likes you!" and so on. Off I go, quite intent on chatting to her more and maybe a little extra. I follow her around subtly, trying to make it clear to her that I like her. I see her talking quietly to her friend and looking over to me, while other couples are giving me sly little looks, kind of egging me on. The pressure is turned up a little and I continue to talk to the girl. She seems to walk away a little to often though and doesn't give me much of an oppurtunity to sit next to her. A bit odd I thought.  I keep on persuing her gently until one song where she dances with some drunken guy who happens to be a friend and then sits down with him. I mention it to a few other people and they react in the same way that I was thinking; that it was a little out of order to go and 'steal' her like that. One guy even went up to them and not-so-subtly frowned at the guy and pointed with his thumb over his shoulder towards me.  I feel a little uncomfortable, so back off for a while. Then I see them going upstairs, and I'm not the only one. I forgot about it a little, and carried on drinking and chatting to people. Someone went upstairs to see what they were doing, and reported back that they were just lying on a bed watching TV, nothing more. A fine reward for my efforts earlier then, running away at the drop of a hat for some drunken guy who isn't even better looking than I am. I left without even saying goodbye to her.  I hope that she looks back on last night and sees what she did, because it pissed me off and left me feeling like a bit of a failure. She was so positive to begin with, but then just ran away. I simply don't know why.  Today I awoke and went to work, but she was all I thought about. On reflection, she is so right for me; my type of girl, sweet and great looking. She's the sort of girl I can really imagine going out with, having a proper relationship with. I've gone out with girls before, but I've never liked someone as much as I like her, even considering what she did.  Now the oppurtunity is gone, I've got to work out a differnt plan of attack. I'll have to make sure the guy who swept here away isn't serious about her (I doubt he is anyway) and then get her phone number. I wouldn't usually make the effort, but she's just so right for me and I'm not going to let her slide away.  What's certain is that it's all messed with my mind. Maybe I'm in love, maybe I'm just crazy, but I can't stop thinking about her. So many questions and no answers. Why did she run away? Wasn't it clear that I liked her? Does she like me? I want the answers and I'm determined to find out.  Until next time, goodbye and may you fare better in love than I.
