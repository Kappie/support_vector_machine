Punctuality is perhaps the first virtue which creates an impression in stranger's mind when you meet them.                           At my work place we have a Daily meeting to review any problems/issues during the day. The meeting starts at 8pm Sharp and anyone entering after 8pm (even at 8:01 pm) has to pay a fine of Rs.50 . This has instilled a wonderful sense of time consciousness in most of us who attend that meeting . Punctuality is to a larger extent the Reflection of one's Self-Discipline  integrity . I am glad I picked this wonderful habit !!
