Originally, I was mainly offstage, only going on to dance the cha cha during the musical interlude which is "tea for two" and "cherry pink". Then one of the male solists decided to stay offstage and i had to go onstage for nearly the whole preformance. Luckily the dances are not very complicated, if not I'd die standing because I'm a really wooden dancer and my memory sucks...  I'm not panicking yet, maybe tonight, hehe.... Wish me luck!
