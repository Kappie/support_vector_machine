ARGH !!!! its frustrating u know? i want so DARN MUCH to help her but its almost like the more i reach out the more she runs back into her shelter, worse still, this shelter isn't a very strong one lo.... how?? can anyone tell me how? i'm really worried lei...she smiles but inside its killing her to do so but she puts up this front so that people won't worry what she don't know is that is makes us worry more........not that alot of people know abt though. how?????
