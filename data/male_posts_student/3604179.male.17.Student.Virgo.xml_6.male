The brewers pitchers did well, two scoreless innings. The NL got smoked though due to the fact that Clemens didn't have his best outing and the Manager, Jack I can't I coach an all-star team Mckeon decided everyone of his Marlins should bat, what a DooshBag. On Wed, I didn't do anything special, Iwas merry. On Thurs., Work sucked as usual, Then I went up to Merrill to watch a baseball game and get some cheese curds. It was 8-4 the "good" team was losing when I left. Well with 1 inning remaining they came back and won. The team went on to win the tourney and go to state. On Friday, I went to Tony Roma's and hung out at the lodge. Fun Fun. On saturday, I helped replenish the driveway. I got 10 unexpected dollars for it so that was good. I also went golfing at 7:30 in the morning and shot a 59 on 9. I sucked, but my game had some high points, I almost chipped in from 45 feet away, and I putted well, but my driving.... it needs to be fine tuned. All my drives either went left or popped straight in the air and landed 20 feet past the women's tees. Well after that, Sunday came, I was on worship team playing guitar. Not exactly fun, but whatever, after that I got to watch the brewers stick it to the cubs AGAIN! They actually ended up splitting the series 2-2 with the cubs. I then watched some more baseball. Our church had a woodchucks game(The Wisconsin Woodchucks are a College Summer League Team)set up where we got free food and the ticket for 8 dollars. Good deal. The players did well and won the game 6-4. Although it was never that close till the last inning. Then Monday Came Softball.... I'll tell you about that later.
