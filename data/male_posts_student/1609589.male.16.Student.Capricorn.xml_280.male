Which time are you talking about, August or November? W: August. S: The 12th or 13th? W: uhhhh... 12th S: Oh, I was there too. Did you get good seats? Ours were horrible. W: We had pretty good seats. What are you reading? S: The founders made a post about their music technology they used during their rock tour. W: Yeah, they use a lot more rock than they used to... S: Yeah, they seem to be changing a lot more lately- they took things from their rock tour and put it into their original show, and we're not sure how we feel about that. W: Well, I'm glad that you like them- I have a newfound respect for you. ::walks away:: S: Uhh... thanks...  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  Here's an interesting conversation I had with a wigger yesterday...  I got on the bus to get home, and this dood was sitting where the bus driver told me to sit, so I sat next to him.  Wigger: Could you scoot out a bit? I have this... situ-A-tion where my knee... uhh... locks up... when i put it up against stuff. Snider: Agh, fine, i'll move out as soon as people stop piling on the bus. Wigger: Thank you sir, that would be much appreciative. Snider: do you know what Appreciative means? You shoulda said Appreciated. Wigger: Yeah, i know!  ::silence for 2 minutes::  Wigger: What's your problem, man? Snider: WHat?! Wigger: Why are you being such a bitch? Snider: How am I being a bitch?  (he starts making up words here)  Wigger: you got pissed off when i said appreciative. You walk over here and get into my spectrum. You can't just go around and get into the moogle of my appreciativeness factor while being such a bitch all the time! It makes me feel like I don't have any sofretes spectrum!  Snider: .....  [bus stops and I get up to get off]  Snider: Type up what you just said for me and give it to me tomorrow.  Wigger: Allright, just, next time, dont get into my spectrum.  Snider: Got it.  Un-fucking-believable.
