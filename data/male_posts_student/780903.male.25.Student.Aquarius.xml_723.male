Usually something contradictory to the case before. Alternate ways of seeing things. Law is like that.  Cases are like that. Underlying the whole set of them Rarely seems some unifying theme.  It's a set of rules, and exceptions Or no rules at all. Simply exceptions. I can learn all this stuff, and I pretty much have to, for the exam.  But This time around, I'm just not all that into it. Yet.  I'm sure I will be.  Tomorrow perhaps.
