Had the traditional Christmas Eve. Wherein my family members in San Antonio join us for dinner.  It's only one set of members.. An Aunt and Uncle, and two cousins.  Fun times none the less.    This Christmas eve. was especially cool though because I learned so much about my family.  I think it is very sad that our generation doesn't really have much to be proud of when it comes to family because we aren't versed in our family history like generations of the past were.  All I basically am told is what I know first-hand through living members of my family.  Anyhow I got to learn a lot just in conversation, as my uncle and my father talked about their side of the family.  I had no idea that Mr. "Huebner" was my great great great grandfather.  Hmmmm, weird.  Huebner means nothing to anyone who is reading this, but it's been a name I've known ALL my life, and never knew it was my family.  There is Huebner Road in San Antonio, the Huebner House, Huebner Oaks shopping center, etc etc.  Just because Huebner is a very major street, like a "Broadway" in most towns... that goes through the entire city.  WHO KNEW?!    Who knew that my Dad's uncle was Tom Braniff's personal Co-pilot when Tom started Braniff Airways and flew as a pilot for the airline he started.  Who knew that my great grandfather was orphaned at age 8 and never attended a day of school, not even first grade?  On the other side of extremity, who knew that my OTHER great grandfather (dad's mom's side, rather than dad's dad's) sent EVERY one of his children (but the one who wanted to fly, and became a pilot instead) to school AND graduate school, 90 years ago, including his three daughters.  Not too common to receive a grad degree even today.  I think the heritage of THOSE smarts passed right by me and I'm a lil' more like the guy who never went to a day of school in his life though, cause I haven't seen ANY of that will-power spoken of!  So many interesting things can be learned by sitting down and hearing stories that will never be passed on in history books, but are part of your own personal heritage.  Like the table that sits in our formal living room from the 1800's, my grandfathers uncle was shot and killed through a window at that table in the 1800's.  Kinda morbid, but historical anyway.  What if no one ever told me these things?  Grand feats and endeavors are not simply recorded in history books, but I think sometimes in the history of our own lives and those of our personal ancestors.  Makes you start to feel like you have done nothing monumental for your family to talk about years from now.  Makes me feel that way anyhow.  My dad's uncle wanted to be a pilot so bad that he had his friend take his entry test to get into flight school, because he knew he would not pass due to being color blind.  Fraudulent as that might be, when have I followed a dream at all costs?   My grandfather's father would intercept him and his brothers as they walked to the "school house" and instead take them to cotton fields and make them work for the farm owner the entire day, and then keep the money for himself.  When have I ever been deprived from an education and forced to work for nothing?  My grandfather is the only person who sat with his father as he died of brain cancer, as he had treated everyone in his life so horribly that no one was there at his bedside.  WJ went and sat by his father anyway, because no matter what, he was still his father.  When have I ever shown such character and principle?  Probably never.  I think maybe one time I let someone use my cell phone when their car broke down.  Jk, but still, different times can be concluded as many of the reasons things are different today.  I do still believe, however, that men and women of great character are few and far between compared to the times past.  Anyway, it was all kinds of fun, and somewhat sentimental.  I wasn't going to share the letter I wrote to my dad (see entry from Dec. 18th), but since I was caught up in the moment, I decided I would.  I read it to him, but of course I got choked up for some reason.  He did too though, and my mom cried, so I guess it's fine.  If I gave it to him I was going to frame the sucker.  I assumed that would be a bit presumptuous though, to frame something I wrote as if it was priceless.  He said he wants to frame it though before I mentioned I was going to, so I will still do that for him.  Oh Dad, u're fun.  Now I'm down in Rockport, per tradition.  We always open presents and do the family stuff on Christmas eve. and then head down to the beach on Christmas day for relaxation through new year's.  At the present time, I'm drinking a mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice and some quite tasty champange.  Life couldn't be much more relaxing, save for that cloud hanging over my head with law school.  SO, on that note, I'm going to make those last few revisions and begin the application process.  It's so hard for me to start applying, because I"m afraid that the second I send in an application electronically, I will realize I misspelled a word on my personal statement.  Or I will notice that I did not include something vital on my resume.  OR I will realize that I could have done something better and had someone else revise it just ONE more time.  Guess what Mason, you gotta just let go.  Ohh, i talked to myself, that was cool.   Life at home is fun.  I never want to live here again, but I do love it.  I forget the things that make it so very special and unique until I return.  It is at that point that I realize that no where will compare ever.  Not because it is the best place on earth, but because it is unique.  Because the experiences are special and the area is enchanting.  It's definitely not the worst place on Earth either, and I'm constantly realizing that I apparently was wrong in thinking that it was when I was in High School.  Then again, at that point in time I lived with my parents and couldn't take a shit without being asked where I was for the last 27 seconds.  It really is a special place, very pretty, and unlike anywhere I've been in the country.  I hope I will always be able to call this area my origins and somewhat of my "home" no matter how far I go away from it.  Merry Christmas
