I got to hang out with the guys and already I was asked by two not to leave the unit;I guess I must have really made an impression. Those guys really need me, I hope there is some way I can stay. I had to put some of them on their face, including colin (I know someone will love that). I kinda like some of them, the soldiers that is. Some general spoke and a lot of the guys had girfriends or family there. I was alone as usual... Colin told me to say hi to Danielle, I didn't have the heart to tell him we are not talking; why? I have no idea. I guess we are both to proud to let the other one "win." It's so stupid. We aren't talking oversomething I don't even remember,It was so insignificant I couldn't even tell you what it was.   Saturday night was pretty depressing, I wrote a blog and deleted it later because it made me seem weak. I was really upset, but I guess everything works out for the best in some weird way. My father called this morning with Georgetown crap for me to do. Not much else going on. Today I got to do some running and clean the house, it needs to be ready to show soon. Later I'll hit the gym and get ready for tonight. I'm trying to get my dad's Jag to drive up there with.   It's weird but I don't really feel like going out. A younger me would be ecstatic right now. what's wrong with me.   "Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try to know someone else and expect them to know you"
