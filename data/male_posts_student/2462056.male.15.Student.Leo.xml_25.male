Well yep, like the mood thing said... I really miss Claire, haha like, really really really.  I had a dream about her last night, which makes me miss her even more!  I hope she is having a good time.  I've only talked to her once since she has been gone... which kinda sorta sucks, but she is probably doing a lot of stuff, so I'm not really expecting a call... whatever, hehe.  Hmm lets see, what has happened.... I got invited to B Webb's party tomorrow night, thats going to be fun.  I went and saw Spiderman 2 today with my family.  That movie is really good, I liked it a lot more than the first one.  I felt bad for Peter, hehe.  Then afterwards I came home, then almost instantly went out again with the family to go eat at Laredo's.  I got a CHIMI CHANGA!!!! It was awesome, I think I'm going to get those from now on, they are crazy good and when the waiter brought them out he said chimi changa really really funny, so I was like "props to ya, hombre" and he was like "holla back youn'un, whoo whoo" and I was like "you straight up trippin' yo" so we are tight now.  Yep, so that's pretty much all!!!!! yaaaaay
