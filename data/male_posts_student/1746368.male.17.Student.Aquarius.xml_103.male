I feel that if I don't perform at the expected level everyone is disappointed. I feel like nobody, except Dominique, really cares about my wants or needs. I feel horrible. Nobody can really do anything to help me.   Mark 10:45 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for the many."  I have tried my hardest to serve, but it seems like nobody cares what I do. The new blog that I started blogging in makes me feel like such an outsider. I will still continue to blog there, but it is hard when all of them have made such tight-knit friendships and the only thing keeping me there is Steve. It might end up being me leaving and only blogging here, like it was before. I wish Dominique lived closer, she makes me feel so much better.
