Ate to much food and with the beer on top of that made me sleepy, fast. I headed home and read for about 30 minutes before I crashed out like a tree falling in a forest.  This morning I woke up with a head full of dreams and a face full of crust. The sleep was a hard sleep, but I tossed and turned alot last night. I woke up feeling troubled, maybe it was the dreams. There were two dreams that I remeber well, the second one was in two parts.  The first dream was late in the night, another on of those "raging jealously" dreams. I have them often, maybe once a month or so. It always involves mimi screwing some other guy, this time an older man, maybe in his 40s or 50s. It ends with me beating the living shit out of the guy. The dreams are always soo intense that I have woke up crying or yelling profanity. Last night was, "Fuck this shit." MiMi didn't even wake up, I suppose that is good, but I wanted to talk about it.   Back to sleep after a few minutes and I have another emotionally real dream. This time it was more invovled and new. MiMi and I had traveled to a small beach area, not really sure where. It's a dream so it could be anywhere, the streets were desserted for the most part except for a small fishing shop on the road facing the ocean. We were riding bikes down the road to a small square beach called "La Gu" - I remeber looking at a map and noticing that the beach was not far away from another beach called "La" - thats all, just "La" not L.A. but "La". Weird. As we approach the beach, directly inland and across the road from the beach was a mountainous sand dune with two women sitting about halfway up on the dune. They were just talking, mostly about being lesbiens and woman's rights and topics of that sort.   Right behind the dune, or just over the top of the dune back towards the fishing shop was a giant house. Old, but well kept and very dark. The color of the outside of the house was dark. I walked in and my father, who happened to look alot like Anthony Hopkins, was standing at the top of the stairs. He was a powerful looking man, who was on his way to another meeting far away. He had just taken in a girl from somewhere, I'm not totally sure. I think she was to be his wife, or adopted daughter - I can't remeber. I just know she had problems with drugs or something - and this is so unlike me, but I felt complete compassion for the girl. She was so lonely and sad. I knew that a little love from someone could turn her life around. So I watched over her, she was around 20, this wasn't a little kid.  One night she had disappeared, and I had fear the worse, my father's maid was phoning him. He rushed home and I had found her with those girls by the dunes and I rushed her to the hospital. They had released her, so by the time I had made it home, my father was standing there, a grim look on his face, careless, almost evil. He said nothing, turned his back and walked towards a limo on the side of the house. I took her up to my fathers enourmous bed and tucked her in. She was upsetting to look at, not ugly, just in pain, hurt emotionally. I held her and she cried.  The next day there was a show at a local pub, Jake and 10kDrive were in town to play and we were in the club early - planning an evil "holloween" style show. We had taken water/oil ballons up in the roof, posted next to an opening in the ceiling to drop on people during the set. There were costumes and ropes and it was gonna be scary. After getting that all set up, Silver Actions showed up and started setting up. They were the fist band, and during their set, Nick's older brother(who doesn't exsist) came up to me. He looked just like nick, taller and with more facial hair, but just like him. He was telling me that his hoodie was much cooler than Nick's and he went on about why it was cooler. Around this time, I woke up. The tossing and turning began.   Weird eh.  I also found out that alot of people around me are taking anti-depressants and I didn't even know. I had alot to say about that too but I really think it would just be a waste of time. Good luck to everyone that is having troubles. I wish you well, and her is a hug from me ((((((((((((((((((((you)))))))))))))))))))
