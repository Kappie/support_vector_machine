Thought I'd have heard from lindsey by now, cuz last night I sent her a drunken email, after mom gave me like 4 vodka and juice thingers. It was for the most part drunken, but I was ina good enough mind to say what i wanted :P. Although I was, and still am, offended by what happened with Lindsey a couple nights ago, I'll get over it. I always do, and I know thats ust part of the deal with Lindsey, so I can get over it, and move on. Thing is, if those were her feelings about ME that she showed the other night, then it may not be as easy as I want it to be :P.
