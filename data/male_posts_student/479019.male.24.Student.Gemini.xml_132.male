Then I finished my history paper. It's a nice 25 pages total with title page, body, and bibliography. Man... I have 2.5 pages worth of bibliography in size 10 Times New Roman font. That's massive research. I might scan through it a few more times tomorrow and then print the sucker at work tomorrow night. I may or may not do a totally final check up on campus on Thursday before I turn it in.   I wonder what I should do now at 2 AM?  ***
