Juliana, Tarlac Actual Signature Date: 7/10/04 by 3 Aeta sitios located near Barangay Maruglo.  MOA was desgined by Aeta tribal councils in association with AWECA Foundation. Money from the micro-loan will be decided on by each seperate tribal council via vote.  Other concerns are possible deep and shallow well projects for the Aeta communities.  ***** HAZARDS *****  Military activity in the area (low level). Aeta communities are located near military reserve. Bandit activity is also present (Barangay Maruglo was recently the target of an exhtortion attempt in June by about 20 bandits wanted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) which prompted an increase in the military presence in the local region - the bandits are still at large). New People's Army (NPA) and Proliteriat Revolutionary Army (PRA) has also been spotted in the vacinity (armed conflict occured with the NPA and Philippine Army as recently as March with 20 killed, 5 of them being civilian non-combatants caught in the crossfire).   Thought for the day: Discretion is the better part of valor.  Aeta Overview: Over 8,000 rural Aeta in the area. Education level for these Aeta's rarely exceeds primary school level (if educated at all). The Aeta community has become marginalized and displaced by non-Aeta communities encroaching into their habitat and because the land they live on are not government enforced or regulated reserves (ie. no indigenous population reservations exist in the vicinity of Barangay Maruglo).  AWECA Foundation conuducts census information on Aeta communities that they work with.
