Horrible...got too many commitments, too little time, so i didn't really have time to study, but after analysis with ching hui, i realised that i could have made time to study more...but i tried my best yersterdae...stayed up till 12 to do all the maths practices, but couldn't do most of them, and was feeling very frustrated. So i woke up at 4.30-5.00 to continue doing, oso to help louis get the essay out...but he smsed me to tell me tt he dint finish. Still gonna fail...whats the use of all this hard work...I m gonna dissapoint myself, my parents n my tuition teacher again...i hope i get an A1 for the next maths test to make up for this one...  Then gotta do the house t-shirt design and the psgm finale board thingy, so todae got excuse frm GM to use choir time to do the design bcoz i have absolutely no other time to do it and they need it by this coming mondae which was rather urgent. The psgm board thingy will have to wait till tomolo...gonna stay back late to do again. Got hist test tomolo oso...muz study now...very tired from all this...still got art to film, and muz go all over the place to film sumemore...  Then my best results so far not satisfactory. Literature ok lahz, i got 88 for the twelfth nite one, but unseen prose which is actually seen(coz we read it last yr) got 74...dissapointment. Juz look at the other nine subbers, not that i m saying anything bout e 8 subbers, but they got scores like 24/25 or at least above 20 most of the time.   Then english. My essay got 23, which means i got a close a1. Tts not gonna pull my marks up alot issit? fail maths barely passed chi average hist...i seem to b getting worse...ohwellz...chinghui totally thrashed me in eng...  SO analysed my situation with suggestions frm ching hui on the way back home...decide tt the only solution is to mug harder...what else can i do...
