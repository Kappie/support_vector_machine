Maybe when we get back or somethin! So yeah, i am definitely sweating up a storm right now. It is so hot and our stupid house doesnt have air conditioning. I really hope you guys come to the dances at our hotel so we can hang out and take some lil pictures!! hehe! I finally got a tanline this summer, lol. Yes, that makes me proud.lol. I hope that you guys are safe in Orlando if i dont see you!! I'll look for you guys out of the 35,000 ppl at the convention center!! Love, Rach
