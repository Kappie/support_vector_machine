We all still might have gotten in, but I certainly don't think any of us have it 'made'.  And Rachel tried out! And she danced like a whore!  Yay, Rachel!   I got called back, but not to sing.  I read for Utterson and then for Lord Savage, and then they told me to leave.  Six or seven guys stayed after I and four or five others were dismissed.  We're supposed to be called sometime tommorow.  Hopefully I'll be home. Since I won't post tommorrow: Happy Birthday Ashley, thanks for sharing 5 1/2 of your 192 months with me.   If you know what show my title is from you win a prize.  Family members not eligible.  I only have one thing left to say to you, and its-- AAAARGGGGggghhhhhhhh.
