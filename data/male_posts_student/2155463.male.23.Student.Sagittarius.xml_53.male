Geesh...this ain't California, so that's a little high, don't you think?  Oh, and then I just about hit a poor kid taking his driving test on the way out.  I swear he probably pissed his pants, I was headed right at him.  Of course, that's what happens when you come to a stop sign, stop, and then  don't go    In his defense I think he was looking both ways - a couple of times - before he went, but geesh, he's gonna have to learn the REAL road rules soon, and one of them is that if you don't go when you come to a stop, the the other person - ME - will go!  Anyway, so I'm halfway through the intersection and THEN he decides he's going to go.  Geesh...if his instructor passed him, I hope that I'm not on the same road as that kid anytime soon...:P
