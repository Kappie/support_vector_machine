I gotta stick it out so the little chumps don't lag behind.  I wish I trained harder for this hell week.  It doesn't ever seem to matter what I tell myself, I never really do the pre hell week stuff I always tell myself to.   Of course with all the construction at school, it's been kind of hard to get into the weight room, since it's closed off.  But I'm tired of making excuses for myself, and now I won't have to.  Hell week forces you to do all the crap...  I better get to sleep, gotta be up bright and early, cause I'll be on the field from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM...  ...Shit
