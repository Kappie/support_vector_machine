Second, no one's going to give it to you.  Everyone's always saying: "I wish this person would notice me," or ,"I wish I could get this."  And their good friends respond with something like this: "Ohh, don't worry someday he/she will notice you and appreciate you," or "It'll come to you one day."  Well, guess what?  They couldn't be more freaking wrong.  You want something?  Go out and get it.  If you can't make yourself go out and get it, you obviously don't want it as much as you say you do.  In fact, if you don't go out and get it yourself, you don't even deserve to have it.  Nothing's free in this world we live in.  If you haven't already noticed, I'm don't really like people who talk like that.  You might call me a hypocrite, because you hear me complaining all the time.  Well, guess what?  I'm always sarcastic!  Everything I've ever done I had to work hard at.  I wasn't born with natural talent or a some god given skill.  Probably the exact opposite.  Sorry if I sound pissed, but I hate it when people only complain and try to get other people to do crap for them.  - Some pissed off loser
