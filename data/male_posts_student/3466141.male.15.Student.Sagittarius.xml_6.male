       
      Walking through the downtown of your brain, Looking for the store of your dreams, Where the last peice of your sanity is for sale, And you smile over the counter  As I charge it to my heart.  I walked down the highstreet,  Sign posted with your fears, A car that was our friendship just hit a baby deer, The cries are those from your childhood, I tried to help as much as I could. But the cackle of the driver eminates from the hood.  I reach my apartment, Located in your eyes, Today was a grey day, And grey days I dispise,  A sign in the window, Of the window of your smile,  Out of my mind, back in five minutes.  I'm told that one was really good. Of course, I don't believe anybody who says any of this is good. I wrote it in 5 minutes whilst talking over MSN, I don't even have a hard copy, it's just sitting there in my chatlogs.  The crazy friend who says I can sing constantly tells me I should write music and turn these things into songs.  I told you shes crazy.
