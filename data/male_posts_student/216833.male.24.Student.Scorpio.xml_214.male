He is spending the night at the center tonight and I hope he will be okay. I think it should be fine.  He seemed to deal with the new surroundings well. He ate and that is always a good sign.  I had a handling class today and the people that came were progressing very nicely. I can't wait till some of them are up to speed so they can take over these training responsibilities.  Now every time I talk about shit I am going to refer to Von Dutch. I'm gonna go Von Dutch it in the big white bowl.
