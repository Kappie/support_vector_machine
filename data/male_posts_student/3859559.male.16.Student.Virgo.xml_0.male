Okay you need a women a friend with benefits is great for us that don't have the time or patience to go into a real relationship. I knkow some of you girls are reading thisand are thinking, "Oh my God whatanasshole." It may be true in part, but who dosen't need to fool around with the opposite sex once in a while. I know all of you just once in a while have to get with someone no matter who they are because you need you monkey slapped,oronion planted. Alright I want some input from all you out there. Tell me what you think o, "Friends w/ Benefits."Remember I'm just speakin my mind and when my mind is speaking it ain't thinkin so some things may get offencive to people you don't like it stop reading is the only advice I can giveyou.
