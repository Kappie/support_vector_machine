The last mission was hard... i almost ran out of bullets. I had 8 left at the end of the mission... whew, that was too close. And the ending sucked too, i was expecting another beautful FMV like the rest of the game.. but was very dissapointed... because the ending was all to short and inconclusive. What had i been fighting for all the time i'd been playing the game? What happened to Sam Fisher after the mission. How did he get extracted from Nickolazes palace? These are questions that probably never will be answered... but i want to know.  Next game on my hitlist: Stuntman. I'm not sure if i can complete this one... i think i'm on the last run, but it's so hard... and i would have to play it for a while to get the hang of it again. I really hate stuntman, but i have to beat it... it's on my agenda... i must do it! It might get done tomorrow, if i really am on the last run... if i'm not, it will take longer.  I went into EB today to see about getting MGS2: Sons of Liberty, but when i took it up to the counter, the guy said "Are you 18?" and i said "No", because i'm not. At the time, i didn't know what the guy was getting at. "Well, this is a mature rated game, and you have to be 18 to purchase it" Gack... since when??? No other store has this rule... only EB... that has to be the gayest rule ever. Oh well, i'll pick it up at future shop for 29.99. Not that much more expensive, and i do get it new!
