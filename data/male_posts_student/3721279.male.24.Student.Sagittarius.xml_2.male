You came to me when I needed you most It aches when I imagine you lost  Do you hear me calling your name? Do you feel me when you sleep at night? Will I ever see your face again? Will I wander alone and never forget?  Yours were the eyes that set me free Your smile the key to my waking heart Now breath is short, and thinking hurts And I fear my time is passed and gone  Believe in me as you once did  Let me show you who I would become You know me as none have never before You hold my very heart within yours.....
