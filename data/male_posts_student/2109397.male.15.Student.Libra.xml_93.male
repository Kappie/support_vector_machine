I can never have fun when tryouts or something is coming up because I'm always nervouse or tense about it. I guess it's like I dont want to do anything or get ran or stuff like that but I always get all stressed and  shit and it sucks. And it seems like I always end up having fun anyways. Which is weird. But I still cant believe that it wont be that bad I still have to think about the bad shit and so I still end up getting stressed. I really hate it.
