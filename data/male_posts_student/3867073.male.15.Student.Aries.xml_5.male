A triple (second shot duffed into the H2O) on five didn't help. But, bogeys and pars the rest of the way, so no trouble. I played with Ed and Peter. Ed won his first match out in mundelein, but lost the second, and Lucey lost his first. The same player beat both of them. I figure if I turn the triple into a bogey, and take three fewer putts, I shoot a very nice 38. Any way bye.
