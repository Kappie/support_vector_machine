But anyway today was interesting because I chilled with my friend Ian Horrocks.  We wanted to go to meijers to buy BB's for our AirSoft Guns so we could shoot shit.  Well that didn't happen because we didn't know how to get there.  We ended up getting lost, so we went back to his house and attacked his freezer and ate some Pizzas.  Then we called up Ian's friend Kevin aka "The Gish" you cant stand to be around him for long periods of time, because he whines about everything. So we got him to take us to meijer and we bought the BB's. When we got back to Kevin's house we shot at squirrels and each other. When Kevin got shot in the face we never heard the end of it. But today turned out to be an ok day.
