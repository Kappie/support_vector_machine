She was about the age that April was when I knew her, skin of the same color, breasts about the size one would expect after April had hers augumented last year, smile as enchanting, movements as bewildering.    I subscribe to the tenet that I will always think there is a chance with someone who I once had a chance with, and don't anymore.  Some will chalk it to the Woman Venus Men Mars bullshit...maybe, but I've got a mental fucking rolodex that reminds me of what girls were interested in me, and I can turn to the page, think about it, remember the cad-like innocence, and hope that something happens again.    I don't really know what happened with April Landry.  That's a lie, I know exactly what happened...the key word there is why...events happen, but reasons go unknown, so you facilitate a reason to fit your telling of the event, you come out as well as you can, and hopefully the other person isn't consulted on the matter for fear that your exaggerations aren't discovered.    I can't tell you when I met April, which is unusual for me...I try to stay keen on who I meet and when, and anyone that I'm interested in usually gets immediate date and time stamp.  So that my first memory of April comes two weeks into her Centenary career, well after I must have known her (you'll see why) is inquiring.  As is the fact that every girl I dated that school year falls under the same category...people who I don't remember an initial encounter with.    April was running for student council, an admirable feat.  I was throwing the meeting for candidates.  So we met there.  Except we had met before...I was the TA for her Rhetoric 101 class with Jeff Hendricks.  The class had met by this point, and we had started working on student websites.     And yes, I had already parused the class, looked over it for hotties that I could use my position over in order to make other positions possible.  No one really came to the forefront...an ex-girlfriend of Matthew Philbrook's was in the class, but she was looking less stellar than she had the year before, and a kind of slutty girl whose name elludes me was there too...starts with an R...I'll remember her for being an exceptional idiot.    April didn't stick the first day...odd, because I'll usually canvas a room, make a choice for the person I'll have interest in, and that's it for the semester.  No one new.  Maybe because I hadn't made a choice before April was the reason I could choose April.    But this is all hyperbole.  April got in contact with me before the candidate meeting...she needed help with her website, and wondered if I could help after the meeting.  And this was when I began to notice her.  She had put her hand on my wrist, just gently enough for me to feel the touch...she wasn't grabbing it, just touching it, reaching out to me, letting me know that she was there.  And I knew now.  And I smiled, and I walked down to my class, and I sat with 12 girls in my English Senior Seminar, and thought, "How'd I miss that one?"    Candidate meeting came with nothing of note for this story, and April and I moved into the SGA office, which was newly fashioned with a window in the doorway so people couldn't use the office for sexual escapades.  April sat in the swivel chair, and I sat in a more bulky chair.  And I was hot for her.  She smelled wonderful, was cuter than any girl I'd seen that day, had a set of dimples that could brighten my day every day no matter the day, and looked at me with bold, soft, inquisitive eyes.    I should have known right off that it wasn't about web stuff.  Hell, I did.  But I wasn't willing to tell myself that, which would be my greatest failing.  She was the smartest girl in the class...though I couldn't remember her body before this day, when she became fixed in the subconscious I remembered that she was the best student in there...and yes, it was easy to tell after one day.  She was here in the office with me, alone with me, looking for help with her webpage when she needed none of it.  At the time I told myself that she was just a good student utilizing her resources.    I approached it like a golf lesson...not because April needed to learn anything, but because I wanted to put my hand on her hand and move the mouse to its proper location.  And sweet Jesus, I sure did it!  We were creating a mark on a map of Louisiana to show her hometown...we got the map up in the right program, and she got the color she wanted, and I directed her hand to where she told me to, and softly I depressed my finger onto hers, and it clicked the left mouse button, and a dot of red outlined Berwick, Louisiana.    Nola Sieber walked in at this point.  I did not remove my hand...why would I; we were just working.  She smiled, a smile knowing and hiding things all at once, and left with a binder...I knew she would be back mere seconds after April left.    The key for me was to get April to stay as long as I could.  And it maybe lasted five more minutes...I asked a few questions about Berwick, why she came to Centenary...the standard.  I probably also told her a few things she could do with her website...trying to be the cool guy who knows a lot of shit but coming off as the schmuck who is weaving his web design game.  She smiled and got up, her arm rubbing against my back as she slid past the desk and to the doorway.  "See you in class,"  I said.  "See you later," she said.    April leaves.  Nola enters.  "That girl's got a crush on you," she said, barely able to keep her smile quiet enough not to alert April.  "She needed help with her website.  That's all," I said, smiling just as loud, knowing full well that I had a damn nice prospect here.    Things were great.  Except for the girlfriend of two years in Denton, the one who I loved more than I'd ever loved anyone else, but who I just hadn't had it for since we last said goodbye.  And that April was a student of mine.  And she had a boyfriend.  And reputations at Centenary are easy to come by and hard to lose.    ---  I'm going to tell the real April Landry story on this weblog...it'll take some time.  Don't know why...maybe I played a lot of grabass up there earlier...but it felt important as I wrote it.  It's not that the story people know isn't real...it is...but it's edited for viewer's approval, and to keep my person as true to his character as I try to make him.  Stories show many sides of character...some inspiring, some degrating, some wretched.  Tellings of events don't have heroes, because to have a hero means there must be a villain.    Whatever...the girl I saw yesterday wasn't April.  I knew that when I saw her, but after I met her and got past the initial push...yeah.  Even when she was spending her time with short-limbed frat nut Keith, I was still kind of interested.  Not in her.  In April.  A girl I haven't seen in two years, haven't really talked to in three, only had one night with but a lot of good conversations in there.    ---  I decided that this next semester will be a landmark.  It's my last one for a while...a while being maybe one year, maybe two years, maybe five or ten years, maybe ever.  So since I'll be quite different and a bit or much older when I return to student academics, I want to do some things I haven't done yet while in college.  But to be fair and accomodating, I will also do things that you guys didn't do in college, provided I haven't done them either, and the don't involve acts or positions that I have ruled out doing in my lifetime.    Comment your wishes, I'll perform.  For me, I've got this so far:  *A bender of more than three days (one of which including class) *Publishing an academic paper (yes, positive goals can be reached here) *Multiple sex partners (at once or over time...never gone the distance with more than one person a semester) *Do what I set out to do from the beginning
