I told him how happy i am with David, and how i really wanted it to work out. If he only understood how i feel about David...Now i have his acceptance, his blessing, and with it...this:   "Dear Andi  I thought that I would write this in a letter, because saying it over the internet wouldn't seem right, and I would be too scared to say it to your face. There were a few things I wanted to say, but I didn't know how, but following Monday night, I think I can.   Over the last few months I've changed a lot. I'm now a lot more open, more out-spoken, and to a greater extent, MUCH more in touch with who I am. And I have you to thank for that. You've given me so much that I couldn't even begin to thank you. But the one thing that I do thank you for most of all, is your friendship. To quote, well you, "you've become one of the best" and I really do mean that. I thought that I would be upset at the end of our "relationship", but I wasn't. You know why? Because it made me realise just how much I'm going to adore our friendship. You're such an amzing guy, and you don't realise that. As pathetic as it may sound, I am actually honoured to be your friend. I'm looking forward to the days when I can come into Glasgow to meet you, we can have a laugh and go home. I know that this is going to work, because I know that you and I have a connection that can't be broken that easily. As a friend, I love you to bits, and I'm so happy that I get to keep you in my life.  I really hope you go for it with David. Even though I don't know him, if he is able to make you that happy, then he's definately a keeper! I can't wait to hear on msn "Oh guess where David and I went" or "David said the funniest thing". I know we'll both support each other in whatever we do, and for that we'll be better people.  One last thing to say (if you're still awake!) is that now you get to fufill your wish of setting me up with random guys in the hope that I meet someone special. Not that this'll be the case too often (I mean hey! I managed to snag you for a bit didn't I?) but still I think it would be nice. And now we get to fufill MY dream! Of having my very own queer as folk posse complete with sex, booze and club 18-30 holidays! But not to look to far into the future........  Anyhoo, I feel that Ive written all I can without going off into a tangent about vagina's or random statements, so I think I'll stop.  Talk to ya soon lil buddy Always yours Daniel xxx"    David, might be soon to say stuff like this:  But im all yours...(Come and get me big boy! heehee :P)
