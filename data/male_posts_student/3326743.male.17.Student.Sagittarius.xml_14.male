My brother and his wife are both in Peru on a shorterm mission trip. This is Rus's third time there and he's planning to go longterm in time. My sister is preparing to go to Canada on a trip to help out some Christians up there. My other sister's health has been failing for some time and now its only a matter of time. She's got a husband and little girls. But through it all God is good! His mercy endures to all generations, but especcially to this generation! I've been struggling a lot with apathy this summer. The bottom line is, I have to stay in God's Word! Keep praying for each other.
