They're experiencing a shortage of raw wood, necessary to produce the scabbord for my sword, so they've asked that I be patient and wait six to eight weeks. I think they mean six to eight weeks for them to make the sword, in addition to however long it takes for it to get to my doorstep. I always find myself getting twitchy when waiting for parcels in the mail, and once the shorter arrival estimate passes, I feel that a grave injustice has been cast upon me, much like a person whose pizza is past due the guaranteed 30 minute delivery period. I'm trying to brace myself for the longer eight week period. In fact, I put a countdown on the sidebar, under my profile :P Really, I just felt like adding something, and I didn't have any real content to speak of.  I've also discovered that photos can in fact be posted on Blogger weblogs! The system is not Blogger-native though, which is to say that I have another web-based service that works in tandem with Blogger. I'm unsure about how to use it, so here's my first test photo. It's a picture of the University of Toronto campus along King's College Road, facing University College. U or T really is a beautiful campus, but having lived in Toronto all my life, and now working on campus in addition to going to school there, it's easy to forget that fact. U of T's campus is integrated into the city of Toronto as well, so it's even easier still. I took this picture on a Friday in late June or early July, before a friend and I went to the Royal Ontario Museum.
