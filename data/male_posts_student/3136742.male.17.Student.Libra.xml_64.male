What you really need isn't a girlfriend but a companion, I grumble to myself subconsciously. To often to I go through this routine at night telling myself; sleep now, it is late and you will need rest for tomorrow. But I don't need that rest. All throughout the day I am to my own devices, which usually means I'll end up doing so little that I'm unable to recount the days events even before the day has ended. Of course I blame this on myself, but why? I've decided I need new friends (not to replace my current friends, but to make more *authentic*, symbiotic, creative friendships... and I wouldn't do something as chickenshit as telling my friends to fuck off over the internet.). My current friends are too wide and varied, and I keep them all mostly for a single attribute to their characters. There are many different groups and sub-groups, and none of them seem to like each other outside of those groups. I've got jocks, Jews, skaters, gamer-nerds, punks, politicians, metalheads, counterculture philosophers, cryptozoologists, and musicians, but no one of I feel I can really have a real friendship with. Pardon the attitude, but I'm just too damn sophisticated for the people I know. I love them all, they're all fun, genuine, great people, but...I think too much. I'm to creative, too philosophical. I need someone to bounce ideas off of, get into deep philosophical discussions and share debates on all topics from music to politics all over a friendly cup of espresso-- someone who appreciates and understands food like I do-- I don't have that. I can't argue with my current friends about why Pro-Lifers are wrong, or why, while God doesn't exist, religion is still quite necessary for some people, or even why Oreo's must be dunked-- I can't get into any existential debates with my friends. I'm left with my own thoughts and I don't want to end up like the closed-minded, idealistic hermit I'm headed towards becoming. My friends are simply there for shits and giggles, as am I. I need intellectuals. I need older, more mature friends. I can't be bothered with this teenage drama bullshit, I've got more important stuff on my mind! I swear, my friends talk about sex and it's like listening to a group of prepubescent girls talk during a pajama party! I happen to have testosterone running through my veins, boys, don't try to drag me into your myth and conjecture-based sexual discussions. I don't want to explain to you how babies are made! Well there I go, ranting about my friends when 1) I like them, 2) they're not the problem. I just want a friend with at least half of a clue of where I'm coming from. Somwone who doesn't ask "Whoo?, Whaaaa?, why, dude?" when I tell them I'd give anything to play "Sir Duke" on stage with Stevie Wonder, someone who actually pursues a discussion when I start talking about Wundtian Philosophy, Hemmingway, or government mind control, instead of just responding with "Hey, remember that time we were lost in the Alps and we ate your legs for food?"... It's not that I'm tired of that shit, it's that I'm tired of still not having the kind of relationship I want. Now, I may sound too serious, and that might sound bad, but right now I don't have time for frivolty. I want to meet someone who I can  afford  to be silly with-- someone who can balabce out the silly with the serious and vice versa. Then I can be silly, but I need security first. I'm sick of being a goof and getting nothing in return. All this sounds like I'm depressed, but I feel fantastic. I haven't depressed in over a year. I've actually never felt better, aside from this cold I have (Who the hell gets a cold in July?). I weigh as much as I did in 5th grade, I'm reading more than ever, I've been coming up with great recipe ideas and eating better than ever... Things are actually great, except for my situations with my friends and my computers. But the things that are shitty are SHITTY, and I think I should have control over that, so I'm gonna try to change my situation. -can anyone relate to shit shit?  (and don't go giving me that "grow up and quit thinking you're so smart" bullshit. It's not like that. I'm not one of those wannabes! One of those jerk-offs that takes AP classes and talks about themselves and their academics like they're hot shit, and then they end up going to some barely-above-half-decent college with 20,000 other kids like them! I've worked as hard as I needed to and it's not like I'm bragging all the time about dealings within the clique of my AP classmates- because there are none- I'm not one of  those  cunts!)   Now Playing (people should use this more often. It's interesting.): Jackson Browne-Pretender, Runing on Empty, Stay, Doctor My Eyes Stevie Wonder- Isn't she lovely, As, Sir Duke Hall and Oates- Rich Girl, Maneater, Sara Smile, I can't go for that.
