Nothing scares me more than the thought of a certain Iraqi dictator with a bunker of gorgonzola on his side.  Speaking of which, a fucking riot today when Colin (why do they keep calling him Co-lin like colon?) Powell held his press conference at the precise moment when the Iraqi ambassador alDouri was spouting his rhetoric to the UN (in)Security Council. Brilliant timing.  Speaking of which, Al'Douri was the same guy who, in the last meeting of the "All Arab Circle Jerk and Smack Talk League", addressed the Kuwaiti delegate thusly: "Shut up you Monkey! A curse upon your moustache you traitor!!"  If that man doesn't know a good dis when he utters it, I don't know who does.
