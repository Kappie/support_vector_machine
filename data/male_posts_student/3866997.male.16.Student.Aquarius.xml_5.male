Oh how shocking, right? *SARCASM*  Well, just before I came out I met a boy named Brad. He's such a sweetie! And talk about hott... OUCH! As with everything else I 've ever done I rushed into things and tried to make him my boyfriend. Even after we agreed that the two of us dating would only ruin a very promising friendship, I still tried to elevate him to the level of boyfriend and got myself emotionally attached to him. Luckily, I realized what a huge fucking mistake THAT was and quickly detached myself. So now, we're friends and I'd like to keep it that way for a long long time. He's awesome, and I love him to death, just like I love all my friends. Nothing more. Nothing less.  Its pretty much just been one giant emotional roller coaster since I came out to my first person. I've been trying so hard to reconcile being gay to who I am. Some of you have noticed that I've been acting much differently lately. Well, its sorta been me trying to mesh together "Trying to Be Straight Jesse" and "Gay Jesse" into one person. What I didn't realize until tonight, thanks entirely to Preston, is that I don't need to mesh together anything. I am who I am. My sexual preference really doesn't affect my personality in any way.  Another boy I've met recently is Matt! I met him only a few days ago via the gay youth website  urlLink http://www.xy.com . He's too adorable for words! Especially in the picture he has on his profile. He's holding a teddy bear and its just incredibly cute. He's very different from Brad, but in good ways. He's sorta intellectual. He likes poetry, and reading. We share a favorite animal in common, the penguin. We've talked on the phone for a little bit over the past two days and I know we'll become good friends at the least. I'm supposed to go over to his house this Thursday to hang out for a little while. I'm nervous, excited, happy, and anxious all at once about meeting him. He's a total sweetheart and I would hate to do/say something stupid to mess things up!  Now some of you are wondering who in the hell Preston is. Well, I'll enlighten you. About a month ago, well before I came out of the closet, I met this boy on Yahoo named Preston Warwick. Our whole relationship started one night when I stole his "Fuck You". I still wonder at how such a simple act of circumstance could start a chain of events to lead to me meeting the most amazing person I have ever known. He has done more to help me through all of this coming out and everything than anyone else. He's listened to my whining, my bullshit, my HORRIBLE SINGING. I can't begin to thank him enough for everything. All I can offer is my undying love. I love him. I love him like I've never loved anyone in my entire life. Now those of you who know me, know that I don't think too highly of online love. I believe its possible, and I also believe in a way it is more sincere than "in person" when it is real. When you can see, feel, touch someone then attraction has a physical aspect to it. When you cannot see someone then you fall in love with who that person is, not how well their skin hangs from their bones. Preston is the only person I have ever known that I could honestly say I can imagine myself spending the rest of my life with. Not saying I'm gonna be gay marrying anyone, but if I was going to marry anybody it would be him.  Wow, so now that you're sufficiently bored with listening to all my jibba jabba I'll let you be on your merry way. The Moral of the Story: This above all: to thine own self be true,  And it must follow, as the night the day,  Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!
