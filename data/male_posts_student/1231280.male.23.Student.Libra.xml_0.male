I've been rockin to this group called The Soundtrack of Our Lives all day. They are pretty fuckin good. They are sweedish and they sound like good 70's rock. If you're bored, download their song called "Sister Surround". You'll dig it. I guess Pfeiffer won $500 at the boats the other night. What an ass. I wish I could do that. That money would sure help. Maybe pay off my credit card bill. That'd be sweet. Anyways, about to chill before I go to my spanish class. Out.  -Sieckman
