I started running a fever last night and probably made the situation worse by sitting at the pool with Jessica and some of her little friends for most of the afternoon.    As you can tell, I'm real excited about this Dario blog.  I love writing and must admit that I am fairly addicted to my personal blog and now probably this blog too. So far only Rebekah and Cindy have accepted the invitation to join. What's the hold up other cousins?  Hee!  In other news, Auntie Charee and Desiree are back from their trip to the Philippines.  I was on the phone with them a little earlier today talking about all the escapades in our motherland.  Hopefully, Desiree will jump online and share her stories in this blog.    Alright kids, gotta go and get more rest.  Its bad timing to be sick right now because my To-Do list is super long.  Love you all!  Start posting cousins!
