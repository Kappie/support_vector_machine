US History, the class I previously had scheduled for that period, will be moved to my sixth period lunch slot (There was only one opening in that class, thank goodness I got in) and since lunch is moved to fourth my driver's ed is moved to eighth period. So while I will be unable to be in Cho-op (the class and the musical) I prioritized my Latin higher, especially since I may well major in Classics in college. So here's my new schedule. Feel free to make comments liberally about the whole issue if you so wish.  EB- PCB Bio  Advisory- Mr. Williamson  1st- AP English 3  2nd- AP Latin 4  3rd- Gym (outdoor ed/team block)  4th- Lunch (early, but okay since EB class starts at seven)  5th- Swing Choir  6th- AP US History  7th- MV Calc  8th- Driver's ed/free or vice versa  9th- Choraliers
