I've been so forlorn as of late. I've been taking so many pills to try to forget. It seems everyone I know's life is shit as of late. I wish when I took a vacation I could go as someone else. I guess there couldn't be highs without lows, so I hope this passes swiftly, or hopefully I can just sleep through it. I hope Farrah doesn't feel the same kind of pain I do right now. I've been listening to a lot of old rock like Green Jelly lately. I've also been listening to You're Not Here by Akira Yamaoka, Suteki da Ne and To Zanarkand off of FFX, and Sound Life off of Trigun in a pretty much continous loop. I've been so down (I know I keep repeating that but it emphasizes the point, ya know.) Well I've got to leave to go to Goju-ryu shortly so I'll wrap this up. To conclude, life will always be shit all you can do is wait for something decent to happen.
