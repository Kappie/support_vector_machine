The professor is also very energetic and witty and the first class today was really enjoyable. He is said to be one of the most respected professors in the institute.           The QAM mid-term papers have already been checked. The marking was pretty liberal and I got 28/30, a high score. There is one person in the class who scored 30, two or three with 29.5 and 29. In this subject, we will be studying linear programming for the remaining term.           We have three major projects (Economics, Org. Behaviour  Accounting)  and two major assignments (Operations and Law) to be done in these 5 weeks.
