Thorpe has been the unsung hero of that series and it was nice to see him take some plaudits, Giles played a winning hand, but Englan really have to bite the bullet and drop him, he isn't a test-class spinner, and it will be worth blooding a new spinner against the Windies. It happened with Harmison, even although it took a while, but look where he is at, we can't expect a spinner to mature as quickly, but given time and guidance there should be one or two coming through, after all we have Terry Jenner's help, the man who made Warne.   Despite the cricket highs, football was an upset. After challenging the mighty French for 90 minutes we were eventually undone by the brilliance of Zidane. That free kick ranks amongst the best I have seen in an international, and it shows he performs under pressure as well. One bright spot for England was that King was the star of defence at the back despite his experience. Keep it up lads.
