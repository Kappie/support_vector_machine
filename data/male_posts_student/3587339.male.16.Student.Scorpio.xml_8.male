Cool people read these things.  should I talk about me.  i am an artist, musician, singer, actor, and all around good guy.  i like long romantic walks on the beach.  okay cut the crap i've never been to the stinking beach and i live in a landlocked country.  i am of course a student so if during the school year i don't post for over a weak that is because i am working on something more important than a ridiculous rant.(alliteration, w00t!)  My first question for everyone out there:  Have you ever seen Sting perform for free in hero square.  It was honestly one of the cooler experiences of my life.  Except for the undeniable fact that i went with my best friend Ivan and his girlfriend.  I told him "hey i hate being the third party..." to which he promptly replied "I'll make sure it's not like that.   Well i trusted him he is my best friend after all...and the fact that i have never had a girlfriend of my own is a sore subject.  I go to a tiny school where all the girls consider me thier big brother...thanks alot.  Anyways halfway through the concert they were over there totally sucking face.  Punks.  Well at least someone can get some.    Welcome to my world of blog.  Unless I have something important to say I will merely rant.  Thanks for the webspace and part on.  -Felbot
