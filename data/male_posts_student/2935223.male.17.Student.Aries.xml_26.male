Hm...today was interesting, I started out by going to our choir thingy and singing first block, which was fun, but then I got uber pissed at sum stupid Sophomores for being morons*they shall not be named, because if you don't know who they are, you don't need to know*  Then I went to class for like 5 minutes....and then went to Mrs. Loneys for focus, and ended up being told to help her control student traffic for the choir thingy...and that she was gonna get us out of our classes all day*me and a few other people* and I was just fine with that, unfortunately, one of my teachers wasn't...that's where the trouble starts.  K, so I'm getting a D in Japanese*big frickin' deal* and so I'm not allowed to stay out of skool all day to help Mrs. Loney, instead, I have to go to Japanese and learn a bunch of worthless CRAP!!  So that made me angry, but before that I got to get hiy by a truck during second block, that was LOADS of fun...... Then the Chamber Choir sang, and we kicked major butt!  Then my dad took me and Ervin home, and I got to take the car and go to Ervin's, where I stayed for a while, and then Ervin took me and I got to go get a new Bionicle*which made me happy* but before that, what made me even MORE happy, was that I talked to Tina for quite sum time...and it was really kool to me.....MAN I LIKE DRIVING!! Then after that we went back to my house*me and Ervin* and ate dinner than went to Mutual, where we went to a jail, and it was really scary...the people were creepy there.  Then I got to hang out with sum hot chicks *apparently one of whose friends thinks I'm hot...which is pretty kool*  Then I drove Ervin home and I am here now talking to you people....this would have been longer and even MORE detailed....but I really gotta get my beauty sleep....PEACE!!!  Spense
