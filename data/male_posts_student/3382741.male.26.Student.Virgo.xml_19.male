I am already starting to have prety strong feelings for him and I have only known him like 4 days.  He is very energetic and youthfull (and we all know how much that attracts me).  Not to mention he is very cute.  we seem to have the feelings when it comes to what we want as far as a relationship (like we both eventually want something long term), neither of us are the jealous type and and we are both open and easy going.  We don't like people whe are controling and we aren't controlling.  We both have very religous families who give us a hard time about being gay so there is a certain bonding and understanding there.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have a bad habbit of going to fast in relationships (case in point my last one with Richard).  I am trying very hard not to go to fast.  It's like my best friend said "I don't see how taking it slow could ever hurt anything".  So that is what I should do ... what will I do .. i guess only time will tell.  There is a part of me that is scared ... that's the part that has been hurt over and over and over again, the part that remembers the previous guys who simply dissapeared from my life with no warning or reason, the part that remembers being torn to shreds time and again whenever it made the "mistake" of truely caring for someone.  He says he loves me .. he says he thinks he wants to spend his life with me ... which sounds great but after the short time we have known each other it seems a little like infatutation rather than the kind of lasting love that a relationship needs.  I do believe he feels the way he says, I certainly don't think he is lying to me or anything and he really seems to be serious.  I only worry that his feelings will change as he gets a little older.  So what am I going to do ... I am going to keep on like things are now.  Spend time with him when I can, get to know him and let him know me, take it as slow as I can.  In time the feelings, if real, should deepen and grow.  Then we can start a something more serious and long term.  For now I am simply enjoying every minute I get to spend with him.  I already started missing him only a few minutes after he left Monday (which is VERY weird becuase I rarely miss anyone).  Some of my friends think it's only becuase of how good he looks ... but I don't think that is really why I feel the way I do.  I letting him read this blog .. and if he can read all the stuff here and still like me then i spose there is hope for us.
