It's all good  i need $600.00 says: im very particular  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: MSN uses something called "slang" and "short forms", its a sort of system used by most people, as to not have to type as much or seem like an perfectionist  Tanya Z says:   happy thoughts guys  i need $600.00 says:   these are happy  *rolling eyes smiley was here*  Tanya Z says: no they're not  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: who cares, tonya made a mistake its not the end of the world  i need $600.00 says: Tanya.......with an A  Tanya Z says: come on. lol not a big deal.  i need $600.00 says: la dee da dee doo    Tanya Z says: come on guys.   i need $600.00 says: *whistles uncomfortably*      Tanya Z has left the conversation.    i need $600.00 says: well i suppose the biggest reason we were friends at the beginning was a) we knew each other at cardinal and B) at the beginning we had similar beliefs  i need $600.00 says: but theres no reason trying without a mediator  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: is tonya coming back  i need $600.00 says: probably  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: did she tell u why she left  i need $600.00 says: nope  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: than she'll be back  i need $600.00 says: *once again whistles*      Tanya Z has been added to the conversation.    When did I eat that? says: well i suppose the biggest reason we were friends at the beginning was a) we knew each other at cardinal and B) at the beginning we had similar beliefs  When did I eat that? says: just to refresh everyones memory  When did I eat that? says: now I can continue my thought  When did I eat that? says: as time went on my beliefs matured and changed and the raport I had with Josh started to diminish. Then I decided I wanted out of the HSU leadership until I could handle it again, and when I did, the so-called and incorrectly named "hate-mail" became.  Tanya Z says: is this hatemail a large issue?  When did I eat that? says: for those of you who don't posses the knowledge to know what "rapport" means, it means the comfort and the being comfortable with each other to the point where the guard is let down  Tanya Z says: thanx. Rob. I needed that  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: im sorry but your right.... i didn't no what Rahore meant, as I unlike some undisclosed people, have better things to do in my life than spend all my time looking up words in the dictionary and by doing so unsucessfully trying to make people feel insuperior  When did I eat that? says: i dont look these words up, they are in my vocabular by natural means  Tanya Z says: surely different vocabularies aren't what's splitting u guys up?!  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: no there obvioulsy not, because you dont just know words , you either look for them, hear them or are taught them, and if I hang out around people that dont talk using 50 syllables in a scentence then thats my choice  Tanya Z says: and is this entirely based over the "HSU"   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: in his mind yes  When did I eat that? says: my mom taught me advanced words in my speech therapy because I head Severe Phonological Disorder  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: but i have alot more important things than a small organization  Tanya Z says:   what of such vocab being an issue? I've never heard this befor now  When did I eat that? says: nice to know that u know what is in my mind.....  When did I eat that? says: i sure wish I knew what was in my mind  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: you've already told me this, but maybe u then need to know that 99.999999999999999999% of people dont have their mom teach them advanced vocabulary, so they dont know what rahoar means  When did I eat that? says: actually, it was my mom who taught them in place of a speech therapist  Tanya Z says: rapore, but this can't be a serious reason?!!!  Tanya Z says: Robert! No guilt tripping us into tragidy allowed!  When did I eat that? says: i am not guilt tripping  Tanya Z says: good.  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: i no he has a problem, its called being a perfectionist, maybe instead of being self insecure and trying to fix it by pointing out other peoples mistakes u should concentrate on your own mistakes. You can't judge or stop other peoples mistakes, the only one you can judge or control are your own,so start concentrating on your own mistakes and stop concentrating on other peoples mistakes  When did I eat that? says: okay, so is your point in life to make large posts that are meaningless?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: let me guess its spelled "Know" not "no"  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: there he goes againg   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *again  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: yeah tonya's back  Tanya Z says: so ultimately, u guys are willing to terminate your relationship over the above reasons  Tanya Z says: lol. I never left    When did I eat that? says: I have my own reasons for terminated it  When did I eat that? says: and im sure josh does too, but im not about to tell you whats in joshs head  Tanya Z says: I'm sure that's the case. Any of these u think need to be expressed?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: well i like always, have told him why im no longer his freind, he has both been told, and from what he has done, he to probably was able to know why without me having to tell him  Tanya Z says: So, this is how uy guys want it to end?  When did I eat that? says: well maybe  Tanya Z says: ... or maybe not then?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: like i said from the beinging grounds for a freindship is built on respect  When did I eat that? says: and i dont respect josh  Tanya Z says: yes. That's very true  Tanya Z says: oh.  Tanya Z says: I meant in regards to Josh's statement  When did I eat that? says: okay, right now I want to work towards the successful closure of the relationship  When did I eat that? says: I for one is ready for resolution  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: well actually the thing can be said about my feelings towards robert, now obviously everyone knows why i no longer respect him but hes made no comments on how he possibly would have no respect for me  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: theres nothing to resolve , though i dont think positivly of you, and i dont think negatively of you I just simple dont care  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *simply  When did I eat that? says: I tried to close the situation. I reached for closure  Tanya Z says: is there anything you've always wanted to say Josh? What is it that u are going to acredit to the "brake up" if you will  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: thats the thing its not a "brake up" he thinks we were in some sort of homosexual liberal gay marriage, srry but i now just like before dont swing that way  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: i call it a freindship  When did I eat that? says: ive always wanted to say that my weight and my comments about myself and my caloric intake are my own deal and he  should butt out of my personal affairs  Tanya Z says: if I were terminating my relationship with a g/f it would still be a break up to me.  Tanya Z says: and I think I would still miss that person.  When did I eat that? says: at least were not calling it a divorce. when a marriage is terminated it is a DIVORCE not a break up  Tanya Z says: lol. I beleive I've used that term to be honest    When did I eat that? says: tanya did earlier  When did I eat that? says: Tawn Tawn is Smart Smart  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: no mr perfectionist as a child that has lived through divorce, they may legally call it a divorce, but in realitiy they say theive broken up or split  Tanya Z says:   Tawn Tawn eh?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *theh have  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: stupid keyboard  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *they have  Tanya Z says: lol. it's all good  When did I eat that? says: and I havent been through a divorce? My two biological parents divorced and it was the bloodies divorce ive heard of When did I eat that? says: i know things about my family that God himself wouldnt want to know  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: aYour right, no ones life is as bad as robs, you lived through a BIOLOGICAL divorce which is so much harder than my or others lives, you just have the worst life ever and we should all just dwell on that instead of getting over our problems or hardships  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: -says josh sarcastically  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: lol  When did I eat that? says: brillant sarcasm  When did I eat that? says: brilliant    "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: oh but academic people aren't smart enough to use sarcasm, according to J**** veiws its the same with applieds   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *applieds  When did I eat that? says: and this comes from where?
