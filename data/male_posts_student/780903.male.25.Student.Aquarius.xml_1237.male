Among the allegations being investigated are that two members of the legal firm’s staff were physically assaulted by colleagues attending the corporate event.   Other employees have complained that drinks were thrown over them and that they were verbally abused.   Another senior Dickson Minto staff member was fished out of the hotel’s ornamental pond in the early hours of the morning after a marathon drinks session. Hotel workers offered to escort him to his room but he insisted on returning to the party...   The Evening News has been told that a female employee was slapped on the face and another had drink thrown over her. Others complained of being verbally abused. Despite complaints, police were not called to investigate the incidents...   A company source who was present at the weekend event said: "A lot of people were very upset about what had taken place. They were very angry that people had been headbutted and punched and that no action had been taken at the time...   A spokesman for the legal firm said: "We are making no comment whatsoever." Well, my summer job hasn't been *that* exciting so far.
