I wake up to the sound of my enemy's voices, also known as, my father and brother.  I lay in bed for a while thinking about the night before in which i got blown off by a rich girl and was slightly hurt, but managed to pull through by riding my bike around in the rain, it always seems to help.  I wont go into detail about the mushy mushy girl crap right now because i took my mind off of it last night and would like to keep it that way.  I climb out of bed, well role, but im out of bed by 10:30 i think.  I get some waffles and start my day on the comp listening to Duality by Slip Knot, not usualll the choice of music i start my day with, but it worked.  Today was a sunday, so that means my brother paintballed today, it got him out of my life for those few hours of paradise, which abruptly came to an end like everything else good lately...  As the day progressed i managed to put on some socks and shoes and head outside, i figured i would go to this tree that i was planning on building a tree fort in...got fucked over there...  The storm that happened a few nights ago managed to blow off a giant limb and move the tree so much it sank into a sink hole...15 or 20 feet deep...so now the tree that i was planning on climbing...is slanted and 20 feet shorter.  I think it will keep sinking...things i have encountered today have seem to be relfrections of my mood.  Today was very odd, one of those freaky days when you expect to get sucked into another demension and start an epic quest for answers...   The day progressed and i got lazier, watched some tv then decided to remake my failed blog that i attempted a few days ago...  But for now, i return to the Canada Dry, empty and still.  I have to go attempt some homework now, which is a bitch, i hate leaving it to the last minute...im out for now...  *Beamed up by Scottie*
