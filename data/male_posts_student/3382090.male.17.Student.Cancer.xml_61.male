Publicity and insecurity  Just wanna be me It's my need to be free  It doesn't really matter Sometimes we run for cover I'm always on the outside (on my own) You never seem to wonder How much you make me suffer I speak it from the inside  Looking right at me (at me) Won't receive my plea (my plea) Tell me what you mean (you mean) I'm not what's on the screen (oh-oh) Faking what will be (will be)  Fighting the fatigue (fatigue) That's quite enough for me (for me) Makes me wanna scream (scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream)  Keep it to myself (Keep it to myself)   *sighZ* tomorrow beings my study reigme for the trials n hsc...and if i start slacking off please tell me off and get me back to work >  its something that ive noticed for awhile now...and i kinda fully realised it yeaterday at the jap day...its that the friends that i have...no matter if your close or not...you guys are still true..and are really my friends and help me through my problems..knowingly and unknowingly..other thing ive realised is that the friends i have now...are totally different from the ones i had in year 7...dont even hafto ask bout primary school since i live so far away from punchbowl and everyone back then had no idea how precious friends can be...well..ive still got contact with one primary school friend =)  but yea..besides my all time best buddy shero...who was my first friend back in 7-Green..ahh..back then...first lesson we had...sat nexto each other in owens's class...and just hit it off from there..haha..we've changed quite a bit from then i guess...not so nerdish...lol not my fault we were stuck in the skips n nerd azn class > blah...no offence to the nerds..but seriously...im kinda glad we leftem..cos iunno..sometimes it just seems that theyre friends with you only so they can leech info n notes n stuff off you...the friendship feels so fake??
