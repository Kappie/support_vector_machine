Our managers told Ashley and me that if we got our times in drive-thru down to 40 seconds that they would give us two dollars.  Well we were running all over and freaking out trying to get our times down.  It was fun and it was all worth it.  We got our times down to 30 seconds without cheating!!!  Our manager didn't have enough though so we got a dollar and a gold card for a free sandwhich.  So work went well today.  Pay day is tomorow, I am excited!  Well the rest of my day hasn't been that exciting.  I came home and took and shower and practiced the French Horn.  I have been online since.  I talked to Alecia and Sarah.  I am in an intense game of online pool with my friend Beth right now.   Tonight I have a student concil meeting at H  It is at 6 and Mrs.Ballien is going to be there.  Won't that be nice. haha right!  I can't believe school starts in two weeks.  That isn't fair.  Well I guess  I am going go.
