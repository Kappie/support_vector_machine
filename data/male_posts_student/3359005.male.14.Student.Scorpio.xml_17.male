Well, I realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog... So much for family... It really doesn't say much of the complexity of her mind, does it? She is as easy to read as a book... And me being a Literature student, I can read between the lines.  Well, there's a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say. That's just because I've been alone all these years. You always with my other sister, and Mum always with Dad. I've never had a permanent companion. I kind of think mom sensed it... That's why till now I have a maid to "take care of me." It's kind of like Survivor isn't it? With two prominent alliances and me as the swing.  I really can't believe my older sister thinks that I'm having problems at school. It's so stupid...Do my results show any problems? Somethimes people like to be left alone, so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause I am not having any problems at school! I really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things. It seems so super artificial and hypocritical, especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character.  I cannot get why my sis is so transparent, when I'm so complex in character. Haha... I'm too complex for anyone to read me, not even my parents. Thinking about it I realise how I never miss her when she's gone... How I never miss anyone but my dad. Could it be that I'm the Kingshaw of this story? Ohh... That's sad... Maybe it's because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual, and I'm only able to mix with those people, and in the case of my family, only with my dad...
