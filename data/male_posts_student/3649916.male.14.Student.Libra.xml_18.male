I then was taken out for dinner to the Japenese Restauraunt in town because i was good.  When i went home i played some uo.  I have been stealing so much stuff in it lately its hard to count hehe.  I initally started blogging so i could keep a log of what i stole every day but instead i decided to write about my day, and what i think about some subjects.  Today though i also watched fahrenheit 9/11.  It was probably one of the most amazing documentarys i have seen in my life.  I mean some parts showed how much of an idiot George Bush is.  It also shows all the people who had suffered because George Bush started this war in Iraq.  I had no liking of him from the beginning to start, and i believe myself even before i saw this movie that they had no reason to wage a war against iraq.  I think he is an imbecile if not worse....wait he is worse wayyyy worse haha.  Well i think i am going to sign off now and goto bed, thank god that movie is over, for i am extremely exhausted.  I cannot wait for tomorrow i am done being grounded YAY.  Me and my friends will probably goto the river or something, maybe even get drunk if i feel like it ha.  But of course if i do i will be drinking responsibly so i dont fall over and not get back up again and possibly die.  Chris  Going to bed
