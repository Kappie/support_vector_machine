I felt it was though I tried. She told me that she'd miss me so much. It was nice to hear though my crowded mind. I knew they were hollow too. It's odd how we've heard it all before about treasuring people, but pay little heed after a sporadic overwhelming sense of meaning.  It's about saying the things I wish I'd said and doing the things I wish I'd done. What if? What then?  2) I've been asked on several occasions as to whom I intend to ask out on Valentines day. To the recurring enquiry, I reply with unease every single time, my heart's in the pocket of one who doesn't want it. I'm not sure if I want it back. Still, she beats the shit out of it every single day.  Why does it always rain on me?
