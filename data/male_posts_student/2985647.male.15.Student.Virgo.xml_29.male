Euro'96 England Vs. Germany, Semi-final, Wembley. Lost on penalties to the bloody Germans.  4. Premiership Fulham Vs. Charlton, Loftus Road. The one away game I go to all season, and we flopped big time, lost 2-0.  3. World Cup '98 Argetnina Vs. England, 2nd Round, Somewhere in France. Lost on penalties to the bloody Argentines.  2. Premiership Liverpool Vs. Charlton, Anfield. Travel 4 hours up, winning until the 86th minute when Liverpool scored twice.  1. Euro 2004 England Vs. France, Lisbon. We all know the bloody story by now, and it wern't funny Dickybod.
