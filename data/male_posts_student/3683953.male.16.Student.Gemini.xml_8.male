Now I'm back to the same old shit as always. I wish I could just turn 18 right now so I can leave this hell that I call home (but then again most of you who are reading this that know me already know that). People say that " home is where the heart is. " If this is true, then I don't know where  my home  is because my heart isn't here at all.         "Home is where the heart is."                  I hate having to deal with the same shit everyday, day after day. I hate waking up everyday and realizing that yes, this place is home for now, and yes, that this place is a living hell. I hate waking up from nice, peaceful naps to my parents arguing over things, especially over money. I hate having to be the messenger in the house, having to walk back and forth between parent and parent, telling each one what the other one said. I have better things to do than that. And what I hate the most is when I get yelled at by my parents because they're so irritable when they're fighting, any little thing like a fly will get them all hot and bothered. That's why sometimes I wish that I could just lock myself in my room and never have to come out. Only problem is, I can't get a lock on my door because  they'll  probably get rid of it as soon as I put it on there. :(                                  One good thing about today though: we went to Virgin Megastore and I got   On a Day Like Today    by    Bryan Adams.
