Or who the hell Chuck Swirsky is? Or why there seem to be 82 comments after every post? Well, it's time I set out what all this crap means. It's all inside jokes, but for the sake of people's sanity, I suppose these should be put to rest.   "Pedroz": Ah, Pedroz... what a great name. Alright, well as sort of previously explained, "Pedroz" is a character in the comments section representing Shawn's dad. Shawn has told us that his dad (Pete) has the nickname "Pedro" from his friends. Well, Pedro went and got a lisence plate for his car, back in the day... which was suppose to be "Predros" (As in, Pedro's Car). However, it was taken... so Shawn's dad went "Gangst" (as Shawn would say), and made it "Pedroz". Ever since then, the name has lived in history.   "Pedroz": Part Deuz  Alright, so what's with the messed up things we have "Pedroz" say? You'll notice he ends sentences with "Uler" a lot. Well, this all stems from a story Shawn told, where his dad had told Shawn that he saw his friend "Shuler" at the mall. In reality, it was Kevin Sheeler. Don't know why, but that evolved into having Shawn's dad accidently say "uler" at the end of every sentence (in our minds, of course). I assure you, it's hilarious. "Shawn... what's that rapper's name... 50 Culer?" Yeah, we have a lot of time on our hands.   "Pedroz": Part Trois  What's with the Pedroz/Darts relationship? Well, when me, Shawn and Randy were hanging out at Shawn's, we were playing darts. Everything is fine, until Shawn's dad came home. We we're greeted with THIS now world famous conversation:   Shawn's dad: Who's playing with my darts? Shawn: ... we all are. Shawn's dad: No, you WERE playing with my darts.. put them away. Use other ones. Shawn: ... alright. Shawn's dad: You'd prefer the heavier darts anyways... the darts you were using cost me 60 dollars.   So we play on that conversation in EVERYTHING. Go back and read some old comments, and they might make sense now.   Chuck Swirsky and Leo Rautins:  Ah, another set of classic characters created in the comments section. Chuck Swirsky is the local TV announcer here, and he covers the Toronto Raptors in the NBA. He gets excited easily... and makes for great entertainment. As you all know, we are lucky enough to have Vince Carter on our team. When Carter hit an amazing shot, "The Swirsk" (as we call him) said THIS now world famous line:   ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  AIR CANADA, VINCENT LAMAR CARTER, JUST SHOWED EVERYONE, THAT HE IS THE FRANCHISE!   We of course play on this quote ALL the time. It's funny to us, but I assume to other's it makes no sense. Leo Rautins is the colour commentator that works with Chuck, and usually just pops in with an occasional "Haha, you got that right Chuck".   Street Fighter:  Yeah, we use Street Fighter characters sometimes. I don't know why... but doesn't that game just kick some serious ass? "A Ducts-kick-ba-ru-kick" ... ah, memories.   Adam Sandler:  We feature many, many Adam Sandler references and/or quotes.   Dave Chappelle: Enriching Our Lives With Chappelle's Show:  Do yourself a favour and catch an episode. We tend to use references from it too. It could very well be, without exageration, the funniest show on TV, period.  Well I hope that clears some stuff up. If there's any other weird crap you've never fully understood, feel free to comment below, and we'll try to make sense of it. We're weird, yes... we know. Here's to more updates, eh? Lates.
