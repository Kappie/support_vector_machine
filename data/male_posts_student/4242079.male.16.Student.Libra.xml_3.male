She will sabatoge your chances to getting onto a first rate sports team. She will steal your car and try to kill your girlfriend with it. Don't ever have sex with a strange woman.  For those of you who are wondering, I went to see the movie "Swimfan" last night. The movie has a good plot, everything ties together nicely at the end, but there are some really cheesy lines and the acting is only mediocre. Other than that it's a good movie.   Last night was Halloween. Crystal and I did nothing special. It is one of my favorite holidays, but nothing interesting ever happens on it. Just stupid haunted houses. I want to be the kind of guy who builds a sweet haunted house in his garage every year. Tonight. I am going to church. I am wearing a tie.
