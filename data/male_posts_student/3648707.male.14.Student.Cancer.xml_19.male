I want freddie and i to bond and be like brothers again, cuz we havent been rele the best of friends since it seems like forever, or March, same thing. I just hope that he somehow finds this site and reads this, and realizes that i dont want to be like this, and that i want it to be like the old times, DC for example, stayin up talkin for two hours each nite, that was the best, i could, and wish i still can tell you nething, and you would help me deal with it, or give me a perfect solution to it. I hope we get a chance to talk about all of this, and that we can grow even closer, becuz now i feel so left out of your life, you never tell me anything, and i dont like it.
