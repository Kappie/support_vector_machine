I went to Target to pick up a couple pairs of underwear and when I get back in the car, my cd player, which I thought was broken, spits out The Darkness (a cd of Jacob's), and it suddenly works again! All I can say is, balla. Yesterday was pretty great too, now that I think about it. In fact, everything seems to be going my way lately. I wonder how long this trend will continue?  On a side note, I'm still waiting for my new set of contacts to come in. What's taking so long?
