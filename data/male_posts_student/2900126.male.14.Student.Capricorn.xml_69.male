Because it seems like it does to my grandmother since doing things for my friends makes me irresposible and shows that I have no "sense of value" for money. The reason why I do things for my friends is because I am a friend and I have good friends that I know would do the same thing for me but no my grandmother seems to think that all my friends are just there and using me somehow *well at least that's what I think she thinks*. But in reality I have the best friends that a guy could have in the world, Sonya, Chichi, Kiara,LinZ, and Jonathan, all great people and even greater friends. I really will miss them if any of us move away.       Yeah well I g2g to the pool and I might swim but I have to get my swim pass so I can get on the plane. * they need a picture ID* ttyl
