She is our longterm sub who has been here or will have been here for twice as long as she said.  Anyways she's this old wrinkley altzheimers lady who is trying to be young just like all the old ones these days. All she does is sit there and yell at people make us do busy work and then grades said work really strictly. She loses everyones papers.  She is so lost allt he time it's getting really old. Like her.  Ask anyone in Big Brinley's class. GOD DAMNIT I HATE HER.  Spring Break is almost here and I'm going to the beach! I can't wait to get away fo real. Hopefully I can bring a friend though, otherwise it won't be as cool.
