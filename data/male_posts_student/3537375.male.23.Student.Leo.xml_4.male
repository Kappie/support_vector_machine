I think Rehnquist, O'Connor and Thomas chimed in on the constitutionality issue of the pledge.  Good for you guys, way to actually make a stand in dicta.  I always enjoy how the Court resolves issues by not actually resolving them.  And, I thought I was the only one who procrastinated doing my tasks.
