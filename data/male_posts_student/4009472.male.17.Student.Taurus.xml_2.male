The Annenberg Public Policy Center has put forth something that they dub the ' urlLink Annenberg Political Fact Check ', and from what I can tell their aim is to seperate the muck-raking from the actual substance in statements made by politicians. Here's what they have to say about it:    "We are a nonpartisan, nonprofit, "consumer advocate" for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in   U.S.   politics. We monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by major   U.S.   political players in the form of TV ads, debates, speeches, interviews, and news releases. Our goal is to apply the best practices of both journalism and scholarship, and to increase public knowledge and understanding" -- Taken from 'About Us     They seem to be on the level, I highly recommend checking them out! Good debate fodder, if nothing more.     Movies   I watched  Le Femme Nikita  for the first time today. It was alright, but not quite what I expected from Luc Besson. Since my first exposure to him was through the most excellent movie 'The Fifth Element' I suppose that my dissapointment is somewhat understandable. It seemed quite a bit like 'The Professional' (another fantastic Besson movie), the stories were similar in content, and there was a substantial amount of grit in both films. My main objection to the film was the incredibly irritating lead character, whose insanity in the early segments of the film (while well-acted) just managed to foster within me very little pity.   Over all, it was a decent film. One of these days I will write up a comparison between it and its American counter-part,  Point of No Return .    Thats all for now.   urlLink
