So gotta go to Radio Shack and get the two thingys. I also have to get a camera bag for my new camera...which is a really weird shape, so i gotta get a good size and good fit one. I got my visor, i got a suitcase, which is exactly 62 linear inches, which is the exact limit for a bag, now the problem will be keeping it under 50 punds or something like that. I got more socks...and i got a jacket finally, and i got my new "kicks" and all my new shorts and i still havent used my $50 gift certificate to Flight 001...darn, they have some cool stuff but im not sure about what to get...its all so overpriced. anyway
  
Today i got up and did the usual. I watched some more of my great Reno 911 the whole first season, which i got yesterday at Target, and that reminds me, i still havent gotten the LOTR 3 on DVD...well, maybe after the tour. I also got some new swimming trunks that actually fit. the only thing that i dont get is...it says the whole first season, and it only has episodes 101 to 108 on the first disc and episodes 109 to 114 on the second, including the uncesored bonus stuff...weird. so, after that i went to what is now my least favorite store...ROSS: dress for less....it sucks...the place is a wreck, its for cheap-ass loosers and i hate it...its soo cheap, its where all the stuff that no one bought at the real stores goes and the price is cut in half. Why do i go there...i dont know. I would think that i was a bit better than that (no offense to the people that shop there regularly). ok, then i went to Baskin Robins, where i had a nice huge great icecream, and then i had a darn good violin lesson, which btw is the last violin lesson i will have for 2 whole great months!!! yippay. actually only grom June 28th to August 1st, but still. Then i came home and rushed the two rental videos (Dickie Roberts and Malibus Most Wanted (which were both ok but not the best)) on my bike back to the store, and then rushed back and had dinner, which was kinda weak, just a bit of lamb, and then i went outside and played on errol's jeep for about half an hour, taking it on the most rugged courses it has ever been on, and then i was caught by robert with the battery dead, but he didnt care, he just was making sure i got my swimsuit so that we could go swimming, and we did, with errol and my grandfather, which was really fun. The rec swim lasted from 8:30 to 10, and we left at about 9:45. Good excersize. sooo...im still waiting for that darn memory card to come, Amazon.com said it would be here by the 25th, and i checked earlier on the status and it hadnt been shipped...what kind of service is that, pretty damn lousy if you ask me. anyway, im really tired. and my laptop is really messed up, ill talk about it next post.
