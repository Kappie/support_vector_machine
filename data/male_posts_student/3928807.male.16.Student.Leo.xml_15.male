Mike told me that Darren's family is going to be at the cottage still for the next week or two. Mike might come over this weekend, which would be cool. We're going to take a poloroid picture of ourselves standing in front of Darren's house. We're probably going to smoke alot. I'm going downtown tomorrow.  Hm.
