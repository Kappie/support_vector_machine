It was starting to  really  piss me off, so I just made one and gave it to him without giving him a choice of name or password. Spammers, send email to  tyler.uppole@gmail.com  about penis enlargement. I'm sure he needs it. Lawd knows he didn't get any of the same genes as me! A one-parent difference can make a BIG gap, believe me. >:-P - My mother is dragging me to this gay  urlLink train ride  from Cordele to some other hick-town. (don't offend yourselves, Cordele 4-H'ers) I don't want to go, I have to work on my State Congress presentation, gosh-darn it! - That's all that's happened lately. Sorry my life's so boring right now.
