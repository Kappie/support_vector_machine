Melissa and I made potstickers and soba noodles and went to the the Duke Ellington Orchestra performance at the Anderson Center. Good food, good music, and good company. I liked the more lively songs. Afterwards I played "consultant" on her art history paper and we had stromboli delivered. I didn't leave her place until 6 AM. The sun was rising as I walked home.  Today... I slept until 2 PM, ate leftovers and did some work for Traffic.  My sleep habits are all out of it.   Now playing:  Operation Ivy  - "Knowledge"  Maybe I'll drink some coffee and do some reading before the  Simpsons .  ***
