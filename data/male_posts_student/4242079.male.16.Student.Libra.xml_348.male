I've secured two job interviews in the last two days. First off, I was dealing with a customer at work, doing a huge activation, and my cell phone would not stop ringing. Turns out, it was the Ford dealership giving me a call back. Interview there on Thursday.   A few weeks back, when I was drunk out of my tree, I applied at Tim Horton's (don't ask, it seemed like a good idea at the time), so who calls last night? Tim Horton's. "Were you still seeking employment with us?" "Uhm....No." "Oh. Alright then."  Today, while talking to my father about the job interview at Ford, he decided to walk next door to my uncle's house (who's worked at just about every car dealership in town), and see if he could call the Chevy dealership for me. He did, and I have an interview there on Monday, as well.   A penny for your thoughts, I'll try to understand Let's go out for a walk, c'mon baby take my hand, I'll listen really hard, to everything you say, I might not change your life, but I just might make your day.
