The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.
