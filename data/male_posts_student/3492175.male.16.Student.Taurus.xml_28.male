Meh. the world is gone to shit.  Actually probably not. other than that and the fact that im in bloody west virginia it all makes enough sense. oh well, im got a good rant out there, so everybodyh wins i guess. also, shaving is really annoying. whose crap idea was beards anyway.(well, theyre kinda fun on other people, but not me.)
