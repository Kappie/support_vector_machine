My palms feel sweaty, my head hurts, I can't focus on what I'm doing and I feel like I can hardly breathe.   You see, right now I'm stuck in a place where I can't really tell anyone how I'm feeling. I'm stuck at work, staring at a fucking computer screen and ready to pull my fucking hair out. I feel like at any moment I could just walk away from everything.   How did I get to this point? Well, my job assignment was to create some copy for a poster that will advertise a statewide high school art competition. I did, and it was decent enough. It wasn't anything great (actually, I can't help but feel like NOTHING i'm writing lately has been that great) but it was good enough to send to the "big chair" and get approval on it. Turns out he thought it was good, but it was too long. What he failed to tell me before I wrote the fucking thing was that he wanted something one to two sentences. He didn't want copy, he wanted a fucking tag line.   Anyway, I've been struggling with this for days. I have the worst case of writers block and I'm ready to just say "fuck this!" I'm still in school (one year left) and I intern at the agency every day on top of my studies. I'm burnt out as they say. Too much heavy thinking. Sure, it could be worse. But the longer they keep my on as an intern (almost one year now) the more complicated my duties have become. It's a GREAT resume builder and I can't thank them enough, but I'm at the point where I need to drop one or the other and it won't be school. It's not like I take one class and then work the rest of the week. No. This fall I'll be taking four classes (full time) on top of my duties at the agency. As much as I appreciate them wanting me to stay I'm not so sure that's what I want. By the way, writing this is good for me. It helps me get back into the flow and break that great barrier that is writers block.   Anyway, I have to admit that I'm feeling a bit better now. If they don't like the tags that I wrote for the poster then they'll tell me. I won't lie. I'll just tell them I had a serious case of writers block and that I agree, it wasn't the best work I've done. If you take writing as seriously as I do you know that writers block happens to the best of 'em.    urlLink Here  is a link that will send you to some copy that I wrote. It will give you an idea of what exactly it is that I do. This is the art competition I was talking about.
