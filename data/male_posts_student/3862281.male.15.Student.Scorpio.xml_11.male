Simple answer, I am friends with them purely because nobody else likes me. That might sound a little hard on myself but I think it's true. I can honestly say that I think most people dislike me or atleast derive some pleasure in causing me pain. Hell, I have the bruises to proove it, it's almost a shame that mental scars aren't as apparent, if they showed as well as my physical wounds then maybe I could do something about it. You learn to forget about it more quickly as time passes though so I guess I don't mind any more.   Something I saw on a forumn that stuck in my mind.   'it's only a matter of time before a vase breaks'   I'd like to think I would but I don't think of myself as a stupid person and I'm not into being blamed for something that I was not the catalyst of.
