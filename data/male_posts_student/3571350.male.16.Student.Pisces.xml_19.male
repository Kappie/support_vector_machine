It was really relaxing and I wasn't nervous or anything like I was last time which is always a good sign for me. I went out and played tennis today!! I won 6-4 6-3 and I really felt good about my game and myself out there. You know what I need? I need some sort of tan since the upper part of my legs are just plain white and it looks freaky because the bottom part of my leg is tanned! Anywho my parents still make me EXTREMELY MAD but my mom is soo cool now. My Dad is still the meanest guy in the house and I try not to talk to him since he's such an asshole. I hope carrie and I meet again since she's in summer school and has tons of homework. Maybe the Weekend since I'm not planning much! See ya later peeps + myself. I hope I continue to have a postitive attitude towards myself :) BYE
