Between the two of us, we have at least 15 blogs, but none of our blogs that we share are viewable for the public. So we decided to create this as a journal for our friends (that would be you) to check whenever you are absolutely, completely, undeniably bored. After all, we're sure you're lives are more interesting than this blog, but nevertheless, we subject ourselves to your scrutiny, adoration, criticism, envy, and pity...and it can continue 24 hours a day because the Internet never dies.  Sorry, back on topic. This blog will be about our adventures in home ownership and our lives as an unmarried couple living together. I already told you that we are excited so I won't mention it again. (haha)
