I think I over seasoned it but oh well :p Played video games all day and watched my bootleg copy of Kill Bill. Listened to music, talked ...... a lot! Good times . :) I realised how ambivelant I can be sometimes too. I hope I spelled that right.   Ave aint comin back till tomorrow so that kinda killed my plans ..... but it frees up my schedule so thats kewl, not that I wouldnt want to go see her. Why do I keep thinkin something's gonna happen w/ us anymore? I mean, I couldn't let anything happen cus that would be totally disrespectful to Aaron, and I'm not even sure if she's interested anymore. I don't want to come off as some kind of love-sick puppy, but ...yeah.  Ima go talk to people. L8.
