I have concluded that I must have been funnier last week than I am this week, due to the slight drop-off in average daily hits (and we really are talking statistically insignificant).  Hence, I feel extra-obligated to post something extra-funny.  This is a warning that it's coming later this afternoon.  I don't what it is, but I promise it will be extra funny.  So tell all of your friends.  :)
