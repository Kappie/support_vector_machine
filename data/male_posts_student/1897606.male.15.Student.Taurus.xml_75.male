Takes about twenty seconds.   What inventors should really be focusing on are the things that piss us off in our everyday lives. In order to get them started, I've come up with a helpful list of inventions that just about everyone would like to see.   #1 Electroshock feedback devices on telephones.   All phones should come standard with these puppies. For 25 cents, you should be able to dial *187 and send an electrical shock right through the phone to zap the person on the other end. Think about what this would do to the telemarketing industry! Call me during dinner will you? It would have countless other applications too... ex significant others who won't take the hint, people calling for charitable contributions. You know those automated systems that have the nerve to call you up and then ask you to hold until a telemarketer can get to you? *187 bitch! Fry their whole goddamn computer system...   Of course, there would be the potential for abuse. Zapping people unneccessarily would have to be punishable by law, but "he really deserved it" would be a legitimate legal defense.   #2 DNA full body reconstruction like in "The Fifth Element"   OK so I suppose it would have some candy-ass uses like bringing folks back to life who have died in some tragic manner... but we're neglecting the true benefit of this kind of technology.   Murder would only be an inconvenience.   "Oh, you think it's ok to drive 57 in the fast lane during rush hour because you're 'over the speed limit'? Eat rocket propelled grenade, motherfucker!"   The possibilities are limitless. Paintball would be a thing of the past, we'd be able to do the real thing!   Not only that, but we could keep track of how many times each person has been reconstructed, and after so many goes, tough shit sherlock. If you've been blown up 37 times you probably deserve it.   Sure, we'd do some damage to the economy with missed work time, but think about it... everyone would be buying weaponry at almost half the rate of the average Texas redneck... so many jobs would be created that unemployment would vanish almost overnight!   Of course, someone would have to go around collecting DNA to reconstruct people, but I'll get to that later.   #3 Bodyfat content tests at vending machines.   This would be a major step in taking care of America's obesity problems. I mean, we tax the living shit out of cigarettes and alcohol, and those are fun! Everyone who goes to a vending machine would have to submit to a quick test, and the price would be adjusted based on body fat. Sure, some people would stay really obese, but it would be a step in the right direction. Of course, this invention would be rendered obsolete if they would get to work on...   #4 Excercise machines from the Matrix   Remember when Neo got unplugged? They hooked up all his muscles to some little device on a table and they electroshocked him into buffness. The dude had never even opened his eyes, and within a day he was ready to knock boots with Trinity... not that I'd reccomend that. Can you say "manly"?   I guess this means that I want to be lazy, but what the fuck did we invent technology for anyway? I mean, back in the hunter gatherer days, they say we only worked about 4 hours a day. I say if we can't get ourselves back to that point, we should abandon the whole thing.   #5 Robotic Labor   What the fuck? How long have sci-fi writers been going on about this shit? Get it together already.   Sure, robotic labor may be the pipe dream of the typical lazy American, but I say so fucking what? They could take on all kinds of useful jobs that the average human being just doesn't want to do... like mortican, proctologist, or DNA collector (see Advance #2).   Besides, if robotic labor was taking care of all of our manual labor needs, humanity would be free to do nothing but white collar work... we could focus our time on important things, like making better video games.   #6 That "force baton" from Minority Report   OK this one doesn't have much practical value, but it's fucking cool. Being able to fling people around on a whim would be really awesome. Mix in the technology they use for those "Moon Bounce" things that kids bounce around on at carnivals, put some goals in, and you've got yourself an awesome fucking sport.   #7 Cybernetic eye enhancement   Maybe then we could get some good refereeing in the (*%#@(* NFL.
