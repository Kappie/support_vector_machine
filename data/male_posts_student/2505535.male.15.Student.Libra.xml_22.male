Saturday, had normal theory lesson, end of the term for that, so no more theory for 3 weeks, and also that evening went to Heva's shindig party thing, me and Dave got her lots of poundland goodies for her birthday, there were alot of drunk people, and I wasn't one of them - it was tres tres amusing. Oh, and Charl got me and Dave hair clips, they're white, light pink, pink and all of them fluffy, nice.   Today I met up with Gemma and went up to London, we went to the Science museum and the natural history museum, that was cool. Lots of dinosaurs and sparkly things. I bumped into a few people on the way home randomly, Cassie, James and Nikki. Interesting.  I'm now entering the last week of school until the Easter Holidays.. can't wait. *shakes with excitement* and now to play some Deus Ex 2.
