BAND! .... good/bad/fun/hell band is all encompassing... its weird.. ill find myself hating it and loving it all at the same time... i feel well quite frankly bipolar...but all is good... i do have a five person squad... the latest member just added today... but i can deal with that...it is hard being a leader... maybe just in my squad ... you have to yell all the time... (not in a mean way) but while doing drills calling out maneuvers and etc., although i like the fact that i can move while the rest of the band is at attention... that kicks ass... oh.. but one thing does not change with my promotion to leadership... my HATRED FOR JOE Stevenot... don't get me wrong i try, tried, trying to like him... it just doesn't work ... between his annoying voice.... the crappy way he treats people and double crosses them (i will explain in a minute) and how freaking whipped he is by Zartman, there is not much left to like... ok so here is how he is doublecrossing... i am in parade block for the first time and i realize that i forgot my squad book (i'm not used to carrying one)... shit... i didn't know what to do so finally i run to get it ... when i get to the spot where it was i see steve running away with like 5 books in his hands i yell for him to stop and give me my book but he just kept on running.... (imagine a very short weasel-y looking kid running away with lots of books and youll get the picture).... so i get to line after attention was called and Zartman indirectly yells at me (w/o saying my name but i knew, although it was true that i should have been at attention rather than getting my book) ... we had a few seconds before starting to march off and i whisper a squad or two behind me "hey joe do you have my book, im squad fourteen"... "yeah," he said... so then i asked "hey can you pass it to me" no answer... again i ask... no answer... so what does the little cockmaster do... we get into the big circle like we do when we end and .... for lack of a better reason... i believe steve ratted (oh yeah steve and joe are the same person... sorry for the confusion... he used to be steve stevenot.. then changed his name to joe when he realized the name steve stevenot is retarded sounding...) anyways i think he got a kick out of saying "uhh Mr. Zartman uhh i have about five squad books here that were left"... immediately after he listed them and im sure the directors knew one was mine... i was so pissed... its a  little stupid thing i know... but that fucker took my book just to look good how flaming can you be COME ON!..... after i did find out that he had gotten reamed out the night before .... so i know why he did it... but sucking up is a poor excuse for just sucking in general....so with that thought i am finished with this entry, although let it be known steve does not phase me he just annoys the hell out of me.... i am going to bed ... goodnight
