I really wish it was tomorrow. Today is done, let tomorrow come. Hey, that rhymed! Yea, I'm done.  Tomorrow I have a lot planned, and that's namely nothing. I don't know what I'm going to do or anything. I will probably end up reading for most of the time. I kind of didn't read at all today. Except for the morning, but I didn't get much in, unfortunately. I never can spell that word right on the first try, "unfortunately".   I saw this poster at Wal-Art and it had a picture of someone that looks like he could be from The Three Stooges (but he wasn't) and he has a shirt that says "College" on it. That's it, that's all. I thought it was funny, just because it makes no sense at all. I also saw the infamous "Dogs playing poker" poster  Well, as you can tell, my day has been chalk full of stuff to do. I think the most interesting thing is when I whacked my mom with the rolled up poster when she stopped and had me run into her. She stopped to fast. Well, goodnight everyone. When your up all night because you can't sleep, think about this: How can you taste the rainbow if there is no blue Skittle? That'll put you right to sleep.
