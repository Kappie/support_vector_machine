Thematically it should deal either with this faux, wrap ourselves in the flag patriotism Republicans are so fond of, or combine it with some vauge lyrics that could be interpreted as a gay pride song.  Something about Republicans, Patriotism and gay pride could make for some very interesting lyrics.  Also working on, "Open it with a brick" and "I own this note"-dealing with commercialism and the like.
