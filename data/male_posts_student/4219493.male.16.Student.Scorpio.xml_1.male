I'm badly in need of a job, but no one is hiring, or won't hire me on account of my age. In short, i've got zero cash and a birthday and Christmas coming up.  Why the hell do we chop down a tree anyway? We celebrate birth and the so-called "new beginning" of life by killing another living thing? What's up with that? Don't get me started on miseltoe.  I know this much for certain: I'm going to end up famous. The only problem is I have no idea if it will be in a good way or bad way yet.  You ever just stop whatever you're doing, and think? I mean, not think at all... just kinda pondering whatever floats into your head... thoughts running like a river that just had that mental dam implode. It'll make sense if you think about it long enough, trust me.  You'll see a lot of rambles like this... this is all from 6 minutes of thought. Get used to it.
