Anyways, onto the content:  Saturday was definitely a good day - 20:13 5K race time (another new pr!), LOTS OF SLEEP, got to play Max Payne for more than just a few minutes, and other stuff i cant think of right now. Only way it could have been better were if i had remembered to watch SNL. I wish i could remember who was hosting...hmmm...  Yeah. In other news the forensics team kicks ass. Novices dominating the JV tournament!  I still have daniels food, although he will probably get alot of it back wednesday. But the mentos are all gone. arg.  How 'bout them mets? they dont matter How 'bout them A's? They really screwed up the 6th inning. If anyone knows what happened they must be laughing along with me. utter hilarity and stupidity on the part of the A's.   -Mikeo   "Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh."  -George Bernard Shaw
