After finishing work at 11 at night I walked out onto the terrace of the Hilton to find Jess Nye looking very bored! I checked supy-visor and he said I could buy a drink. However, I did not pay for said drinks as the bar manager knew I worked there (hard not to notice from the bright yellow shirt and the name badge with the Hilton sign on it!) So we got free drinks! Also, the man who was looking after the wedding saw me and Jess talking and asked me if I was chatting her up! You can imagine the reaction he got! Anyway, that was all. Pedro is waiting for me to give him a sensual massage! Bye bye!
