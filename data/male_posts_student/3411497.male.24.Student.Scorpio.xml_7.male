I have come to the grim realization that I too could be a star -- if only, I too, were an overweight, snaggle-toothed, boring-as-hell little harpy -- like Laurie Notaro.  She has just finished imparting upon her legion of boring/bored fans a story about how one time she accidentally ripped open a pair of pants.  When discovered, she pretended she was swatting flies.  Isn't that funny?  I mean, oh my god, isn't that so goddamn fucking funny?!  I don't know about you, but to me, that story, the whole idea of that story, is so funny that it makes my butt water.  I have endured her blood-curdling cries of cued laughter for only one-half of an hour, and already I have considered stabbing myself in the ear with a pair of scissors as a desperate attempt to escape the pain... the only reason I have avoided doing so is that I know this hell will end before long, and that a massive head wound is something (despite it making a good story to tell to my grandchildren) I will ultimately regret.  Tell me, what defines celebrity?  What defines funny?  Is it simply capturing the zeitgeist?  Because Laurie Notaro, like no other, has captured the idiotic zeitgeist -- and the people here love her, and I know of nothing else to do except vent here, and hope that some wayfaring soul with a special communication with God recognizes my pained soul, prays for my mercy, have God grant me mercy, and then apotheosize.
