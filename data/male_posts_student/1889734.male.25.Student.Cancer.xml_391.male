Now the Angry Left can have its voice heard on the national stage.   Listen to the Democrat establishment try to discredit Nader:  "It's his personal vanity because he has no movement. Nobody's backing him," New Mexico Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson said.  i bet Nader does pretty good this time around. Not as good as in 2000, since the Angry Left will do anything to beat Bush, even pull the lever for Lurch, a.k.a. Kerry. But the true believers will go for Nader. honestly, I want them to! Everyone should vote on their principles, and it shows the utter lack of such in those who vote for no other reason than to get revenge on george W. Bush. I will continue to vote Libertarian, in the hopes that it might turn the Republicans away from the path of Big Government and towards a better path.  This coming campaign should be highly entertaining. I bet Bush dominates Kerry in debates. He has grown into his role as President, and it will show in the upcoming bruhaha.
