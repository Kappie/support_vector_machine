Tim Robbins haunted by a horrible event from childhood becomes suspect in the murder of Sean Penn's daughter.  Sean plays the local ganster/godfather type and puts pressure on the third friend (Kevin Bacon) who also is the lead investigator.  All in all,  I was pretty riveted, and nearly in tears when Kevin comes to Sean towards the end looking for Tim and says "Have you seen Dave?  Dave Boyle?" to which Sean replies "Last time I saw Dave, he was in the back of a car heading that way down the road" refering to the abduction Dave had to endure.
