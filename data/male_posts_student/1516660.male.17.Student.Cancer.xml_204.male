We went to Admiralty Place to eat lor. What did I eat? Oh yeah. Chicken rice. The tenpanyaki bencurd is real nice. Must eat it next time. I went to Popular and saw this must buy Charmed Book. Seasons of the Witch, Volume 1. So I brought it and read it during the car journeys.  We went to Carrefour. My father wants to buy some new trousers. Hmm....What did I buy there? X-Men 2 the VCD and Clay Aiken's debut album, Measure of a Man. There was this Top 10 CDs section. I went over, and saw Measure of a Man. I listened to his CD and actually found his songs very nice. So, I brought it lor. I suggested to my mother to buy a CD-radio for me. I always wanted a radio to listen to and to play my CDS. My mother says the radio there is lousy, so we are going to buy at Courts.  Therefore, our next stop is Courts. We went to the Ang Mo Kio branch. I got three choices avilable for me. A Sony, Phillips and Thompson. After much deliberation, I chose the Thompson model, due to its good stereo system and its ability to play CD-Rs/CD-RWs. Hmm! YaY!! Finally had a radio in my room le!! :)  Okay. For dinner, we went to the Zheng Fa Huo Hai Xian. Yep, I know. Same place I went on Friday. This time, I can choose what to put in the soups and don't have to face possible disasters/insults when i splashed the soup all over looking for my hams. Hmm...this time, we ate more meat, more harms, more seafood. Heh heh. I felt more full than Friday. HeHe!!  After that leh, came back home. I finished my book already. Great Charmed book. I took a bath and connected the radio. Moo meow! I was so freaked out at first. The radio has no static when I was in front of it. But when I moved away, static came. This reminds me of one of the Mr Bean episodes (if any of you have seen, you know what I am talking bout, right? Where Mr Bean have to strip to watch his TV? HaHa!). So, I moved the position of the radio, facing me. Now, it has no static. HaHa! So freaky!!  Alright, I felt like composing a To-Do and a To-Nuy list. So here goes:   Things to buy:  -Galadriel Water's Harry Potter books -Charmed books -Chirstmas presents    Things to do:  -Spring clean my table (too cluttered...especially with the addition of the radio) -Decide on who to buy Xmas presents and what to give them -Decide on whether to follow WQ to queue overnight or not -Watch all my taped programmes for Fri and Sat. 3.5 hours of shows to catch up!  Alright. I gotta be going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
