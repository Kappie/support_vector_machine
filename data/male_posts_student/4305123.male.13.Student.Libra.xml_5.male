I'm 13, Jewish, Canadian, and in Grade 9. I'm a Liberal/Democrat, I support Kerry, not Bush, Paul Martin, not Stephen Harper, and I am probably going to be too lazy to regularly update this blog. So you'll just have to suffer without my enlightening intellect in between periods of blog writing-inducing boredom. Which, incidentally, is the name of this blog.  Because this is the first post, I'm now going to bore you to death with things that I like, you know, the regular profile kinda thing. I recommend you skip this part unless you have no clue who I am.  I want to start playing drums, I ski and bike alot, and I have some seriously anarchistic political opinions. I work out daily, usually with friends, and try to eat O.K., although I'm addicted to pizza, pop, and Twix bars.  I read a hell of a lot. I mostly read Sci-Fi and Horror.  I love to hang out at home on MSN and bike around Vancouver, as well as watch movies.  I also listen to a lot of music, in a lot of genres, although mostly rock, and sometimes rap. Some fave bands: Smashing Pumpkins, Deftones (MONDO GOOD), Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, System of a Down, and Sinisstar. I play a tabletop wargame called Warhammer 40,000, in which I have built and painted an army of Space Wolves. I also ski and bike routinely and play soccer and football, athough I'm not on any teams.  I'm obsessed with Apple Computers and am wasting a large portion of my life trying to convince PC users to switch to macs.  A lot of "I" sentences. Man, am I self-centered. What an asshole I am. :p  Some favorite quotes:  "God does not play dice with the universe." -  Albert Einstein  "An eye for an eye, and soon the whole world is blind." -  Mahatma Gandhi  If anyone noticed, I just ripped these off of my MSN Profile. Don't like it? Sue me. Actually? Don't. The repo men would come take my iBook, and I've have to kill them.  Anyway...  I just got back from a very fun 7 days in Whistler, where I did some mountain biking, both XC and Downhill (I'm still limping because of sore calf muscles. Should've stretched.), swam in lakes, went horseback riding, and ate a lot of Cows ice cream. Before that I was in Europe for two weeks, first in England and staying with my Aunt and Uncle, then to Holland, staying with my 2nd cousins, and then back to england for a half a week. Had tons of fun, took loads of pictures, and wrote a diary, but I'm too lazy to type it up here. And besides, you don't give a damn anyway. :p Met a whole swack of Dutch relatives, went to an English pub, tried some "exotic" foods like Pie and Mash, Pork Rinds, Dutch Meatballs, Pofertjes (mangled the dutch spelling there), and Stroop Wafels, which are still my favorite food EVA! (By the way, if you are a friend of mine who lives close and wants to try one, gimme a call. And no, insane, psychotic child abusers and hot babes that are stalking me, I won't put my phone number on the internet. Email me if you have to, or comment here.)   So. Had a lot of fun.  On Monday I'm going to Seattle with my only brother (younger) and my dad to see the Science Fiction museum they put up there, and to go to the Theme Park and the kickass mall there. I kind of like Seattle, in a way it's kind of a rip off of Vancouver, but at least Starbucks and Nirvana came out of it, plus they have a kickass mall, and I like to think of it as the little brother of Vancouver, anyway.  Anyway... (I've counted 3 anyways, so far. Seems like a lot.)  After that, I'm going to Edmonton, where we'll clean out my Grandmother's house, now that she's moving to a Home here in Vancouver after my Grandfather died of lung cancer recently (Those unfiltered Export As really get to you later in life.), which will be a huge job, as they never liked getting rid of things. Kind of pack rats left over from WW2 when supplies were short.  And, after that, it's a free week, and then back to the dreaded SCHOOL!  Thankfully I have school-supply shopping and the first lazy day where we meet our teachers to look forward to, so I won't die of boredom. Like the blog.  *Note to self-Must remember to get one of the big lockers FIRST this year. Having two small ones doesn't cut it.  Before I wrap this extended turd of a blog post up, I'm going to include a link to my friend Jaques Clapauch's blog, so you can all read it. It's my inspiration to start this one, along with the other blogs I've seen, especially political ones.  http://www.phantomcaller.theblog.com.br/  Adios, amigos. Shalom, chaverim. Bye, friends.  (Or enemies.)
