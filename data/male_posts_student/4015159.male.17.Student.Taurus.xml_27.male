Today on my driving lesson I drove right into town, over the new bridge :D:D:D. Well proud of myself, was A LOT easier than I expected!          I have begun a new adventure today as well, with 4 little creatures to accompany me. A Pidgey, a Caterpie, a Nidoran (Female), and a Charmander. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have begun Pokemon Blue!!! And that will be something to do with tomorrows task.          The Eighth Task          Tomorrow I will, by 6pm, have 20 pokemon owned and 40 pokemon seen! It should be very simple so there is a catch. At least 10 of my caught pokemon must have been on my team and be over level 20!!! It seems boring for you but very interesting for me :D
