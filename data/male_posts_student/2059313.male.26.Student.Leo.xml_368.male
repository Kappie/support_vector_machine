And on those wonderful occassions, you get both those wonderful feelings wrapped up into the great package of one day.  Those are the days when you don't know if you'll make it out alive.  Y'know the days I'm talking about - they're the ones where you wake up feeling great, you look outside and it's an absolutely beautiful day outside.  Then you get a phone call, or an e-mail, or a letter (or you DON'T get that phone call, or that email, or that letter)... and your heart sinks.  Then maybe later, you hear your favorite song on the radio, or you get a phone call from a close friend, or an e-mail from someone you haven't spoken with in a while.  Then later that day, something again, may cause the sun to not look-so-shiney, the sky to look not-so-blue, and the day to look not-so-great.  Life is full of disappointments, of sorrows... but it's also full of joys, excitements, and wonder.  I think sometimes it's all who we look to for support... when we look inward or to the wrong people, we stumble, fall, and fail.  When we look up to the heavens and embrace the One, the Almighty, the Creator, the Father... we realize that nothing matters but how we treat people around us, and that we live our lives to the fullest, without regret, without anger, without bitterness... with compassion, kindness, caring, friendship, and love.  ... it's amazing how the word of God will change everything in a heart-beat.
