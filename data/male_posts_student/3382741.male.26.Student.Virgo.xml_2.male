Maybe if i can get into a habbit of doing it.  i was going to put nice juciy incriminating things here.  Like how anoyed i am about certain things with my b/f.  he does EVERYTHING with his friend ... which is great except that it seems like he can't do anything without them (even something like going to a movie with just me and him).  The last few weekends I have been down there I have wanted to go to a movie.  he hasn't seemed that interested in going and that is OK ... the one time we were actually trying to get things together he called his friends to see if one of them wanted to go.  it didnt seem anyone else was going so he didnt want to ... now granted there were other things (like the time and such) that he said were a factor ... but it just seems to me like he doesnt want to do things with just me.  i dunno - maybe i am just paranoid.  he was kinda down all this past weekend, said he has a lot on his mind.  i know he does - he is getting ready to move - and had many decisions to make in the very near future.  some of it is kinda driving me nuts tho.  i love him ... and sometimes i feel that returned very well ... but at other times its like he is almost sick of me.  ok enough about that.  work .. ugh ... UGH.  I am now scheduled to work Sun - Fri yet somehow working 6 days a week I still don't get 40 hours. some days i drive an hour to work .. work 4 hours .. then drive an hour home ... it sux!!  especially with gas prices as high as they are.  oh well i need to money so I guess i suck it up and go.  nothing else is really going on in my life.  i have been playing with a new toy -- Linux -- it's relatively evil, but I get some measure of pleasure bending it to my will muah haa haa (evil laugh?).  ok that enough fer now ... more to come .... i hope
