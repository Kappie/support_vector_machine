So, instead of peaceably going home and gaming, say a little DX2, I run off to  another  meeting for my church. This one was more productive. I learned more about the pastor candidate and all his Canadian goodness.  I re-checked my Brothers Karamazov yesterday. I have until Tuesday to read the rest of this behemoth. A challenge I shall meet with vigor! And speaking of behemoths, I borrowed Calvin's Institutes of Christianity for my aunt. Its in two books and at least 1700 pages in total! A good summer reading I see.
