I have been deciding whether to send her a SMS for the last hour and in the end i use a coin to decide- tails (Dont send)! It not as easy as you think... Sometimes i wonder whether do i mean anything to her?!?! Wad if she finds me an irritant?!?! haiz, we dont talk not to say that we look at each other...                I am not blaming her, but rather i am blaming myself. I am always giving that 'dao' attitulde to her, making her invisible to my eyes! I dunno why i did that for?? Pride, i guess. But even then, i am abit SHY... :) haha! Well seriously, i really dunno wad to do... I dont think she will even take the initiative to talk to me. So its up to me, after all! Shit, i hate this feeling... I do not have this feeling when i am too engross with my work!!! thats y, i did not talk to her since June... I just hope she knows that i still like her and ya...               Abt the SMS, i shall see whether to send later in the afternoon or night... Haiz!!!!
