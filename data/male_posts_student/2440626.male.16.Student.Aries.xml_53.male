School is just about over...I think there are only 11 more days ::angels sing the "Hallelujah Chorus"::  In English, we are ready the worst novel on the face of the planet: "The Red Badge of Courage."  It is truly horrible.  Anyway, I am extremely happy that summer is near, however, I have no vacation plans yet.    I am really hoping that 2 of my Californian friends will come visit. (I am also hoping that they read this).  I am looking forward to holding my ALIAS Season 2 marathon with my good friend Lauren (aka the girl in the picture).  Speaking of ALIAS, the season finale is on the 23rd  , so tune in for some major drama and kick-butt cliffhangers.  Speaking of season finales, One Tree Hill had its finale last Tuesday.  All I can say is I can't even stand the wait unitl this fall.  That will go for ALIAS too, once I see the finale of course.  Well I better get moving.  I have a violin that is lonely.  I'll be back sometime.....
