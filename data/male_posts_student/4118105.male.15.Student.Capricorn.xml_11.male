So, anyway, what's been going on with me? Well, not much. My skin is so pale now from not going outside that anyone could tell that I haven't been doing anything.  I'm so used to going on vacations in the summer. This year, though, my dad bought an apartment complex that  he's going to try to rent out. That brings us to have an apartment building, an empty old bar, and three houses in addition to the one we're living in. Lucky us. And even luckier is whoever gets the mortgage money.  So, there have been a few things I've been up to. For one, I've been using the treadmill a whole lot. Last night I went to bed at five in the a.m. after 5 miles on that thing. Why? I guess because I don't do anything else. This is just an easy way to make sure I don't get all loose and flabby.  I still do the sit-ups, but I suppose the fact remains that I have no abs. I've been trying to build up muscle for four years, but still nothing. Sure, I might have a strong stomach, but nothing actually shows.  I can do 35 push ups now! OMG! And the next day my arms hurt.  Lately I've been posting on forums like crazy. For those of you in the know, ilovebees consumed me for a while. I've retired from that. It was boring. It kept me up too late. Really, I'd never be able to figure it out. I don't even know why I tried.  I still haven't finished Xenogears. The last boss is just too tough. I mean, if you actually know the story, this shouldn't even be a fight you'd be able to win, no matter how strong you are. See, you have all sorts of mega-ultra-super powers to unleash, but it really doesn't matter. This thing rips you apart.  I finished Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay again. Awesome game. Awesome. If you have an X Box, play it. If you don't, buy one so you can play it. The top shooters of '04: Far Cry Escape from Butcher Bay Doom III Half Life 2 Halo 2  So cool. Fable comes out soon. I wonder how long that'll keep my attention.  In other news, I still haven't really done anything worthwhile. It seems to me that a lot of people are complaining that they're bored or that they don't have anything to do. Well know what? I am the epiphany of boredom. I literally never leave the house except for work. I don't call people, no one calls me. I only have 32 people on my AIM buddy list, and I don't even talk to half of them. Does this mean I don't have any friends? I don't know. Maybe.  I've been meaning to start re-learning Greek again. If me and the dudes are going to head to Kefalonia after Senior year, we're going to need at least one person to help translate. If we go to Athens, it'll be completely necessary to have someone who knows the crazy-ass Greek lingo. Still, the island is a tourist place. Last time I went most people sounded like they were from England. Oh man, I'm excited already.  I don't think I'm going to finish my Halo 2 story. I got a little ways into chapter 3, and then I realized just how long it'd take to finish it. There's no way I'd be able to do it before November. I wanted it to fit into Halo's story. If Halo 2 changes up that story from what we know, my fiction will become absolutely useless. So I'll probably type up my storyboards sometime. Maybe in my next blog.  So far the only movie I've seen this summer is Spiderman 2. Sure, it was a great movie, but I've missed out on a lot. Ah, well, that's what usually happens to me. I slack off too much and lose whatever I wanted to do. Meh.  I've also been trying out so strategy RPGs online, namely Dark Throne and Kings of Chaos. I haven't really been paying much attention to either. Dark Throne just doesn't grab my attention too much, and KoC is way too slow-paced. There's also another game called Kingdom of Loathing, and I've been spending a lot of time with that. I'm currently a level 4 Disco Bandit. A Jiggy Grifter. Heh heh, the game is funny. What other game has you fighting possessed cans of asparagus and a troll who barbeques nipples?  I got a surround sound thing for my TV downstairs, so I've been reliving some old games. Halo is brilliant with the bass turned up. Brr-ap Brr-ap.  Is there honestly anything I can do to jumpstart the rest of my summer? I've been neglecting friends. I've been ignoring a lot of people. I don't clean my room. I haven't all summer. Is there something wrong with that?  Maybe I just don't live well without something to do. I don't like that fact, but even Joe saw how pathetic I am right now. He came over bearing gifts of wheat and barley (well, corn and melon, actually), and stood witness to my obsession with this little thing I call "my computer".  I always figured I'd be able to do what I want when I wanted to. I must've assumed wrong. Right now I do absolutely nothing. I'm either sleeping, working, or typing. My eyes hurt, I'm always tired, and at work I'm miserable. Ugh.  The other dishwasher from work quit, and guess who gets to replace him. Yeah, me! How lucky! Now I get to work every day!  We might go to Canada again before the summer's over, but to be honest, I really don't want to. What I want is to go to the beach or something and just hang out with some friends. That I may or may not have.  I've never been a very socially-inclined person. I don't know why. Am I boring? Am I shy? Am I just plain strange? Why is it that I can't just be like everyone else? While all the rest of the world is trying to be different, I'm trying to figure out how to be the same.  School starts on the 26th. Ilovebees ends (?) on the 24th. That might give me a good two days of fun, assuming a Halo 2 demo is released.  Yeah, I'm boring. That's got to be it.
