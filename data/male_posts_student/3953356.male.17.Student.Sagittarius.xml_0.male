At the moment I can hear the air being squeezed in and out of a bouncey castle, of which I will be bouncing upon later this eve. There is a BBQ outside my house so we are going!!! Gonna be a few broken hips! All in the name of fun. I would like to celebrate the return of Mattius with a round of applause! And the death of Heliana and Lauren, also with an applause. (That was cold). This Wednesday is outing time. Anyperson who wishes to accompany me and Rocio to the cinema to watch the incredibly awesome Thunderbirds please let one know as soon as possible. Thats all I have have to say... Oh apart from "HELEN, LAUREN. I TAKE YOU BOTH DOWN!!!!"
