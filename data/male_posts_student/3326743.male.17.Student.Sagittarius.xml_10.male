One of the things I've dealt with in becoming a senior is that all my friends who were previously seniors are now gone.  I've dreaded my senior year since I was a freshman because I knew that I would lose a lot of friends.  However, God gave me you guys for whom I am very thankful, and Daniel has always been a constant.  Facing summer though is almost more daunting than facing my senior year.  I struggle a lot during the summer.  Without the precautions of school and the Godly influences that are in my life during the school year it becomes very difficult to do what's right and very easy to do what is wrong.  My prayer is that through the Bible study and this website that I will stay accountable to God and do what is right.  I hope that we all have this prayer, that "the mind of Christ our Savior [may] dwell in [us] from day to day.  By it's power and love controlling, all [we] do and say."  In the back of William Borden's Bible were found these three phrases: "No reserves.  No retreats.  No regrets."  During the summer and my life I want to give all the way and go all the way without groaning that I may please God.  By God's grace I think I can.  I pray that we all can.  See you and pray for you.
