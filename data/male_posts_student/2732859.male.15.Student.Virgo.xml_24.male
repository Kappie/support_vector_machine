Why was everyone so shocked that a 93 year old man died?  He was 93!!!  The media was also saying how great he was and talking about the great legacy that he left the country and the world.  Yeah, good job Mr. President, you left us with an ensuing recession, a huge, unprecendented defeciet (that is, before President Dubya), a polarized nation, and so much more.  Unemployment was up to 10% during one point of his term.  Ok, well at least that is all over now and we can move on.
