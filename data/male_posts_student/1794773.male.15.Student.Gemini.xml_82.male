I'm glad you chose what you wanted to do. i think you made the right decision and don't worry I'm behind you in your decision. oh yeah and i think i left my camera at your house so i dont know when you can get that back to me. i probly wont be seeing you till school starts so thats fine if you get it back to me then. About Cedar Point... i dont think that will work out cuz everything is so crazy and we wont be able to set a date. so maybe next summer we can do that.
