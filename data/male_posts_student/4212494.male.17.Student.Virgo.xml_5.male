I'm in an RP at Gaia Online, a Yu Yu Hakusho RP, as Elder Toguro. I was there most of the day, but I did help my friend paint his porches (he has 3) for a few hours. Well, actually, he painted...I put Primer on the wood surfaces. It was quite boring, sitting there putting on a few coats of primer with nobody to talk to....But anyway, after that I went to Gaia. Yep.          Today was kinda weird in one aspect, though.....A 12-year-old friend (a guy) of my 14-year-old sister (a girl...I think) confessed his love to me today @_@.....It was a little weird. Well, I'm out. Bai, all! Whatchu talkin' 'bout, everyone!!
