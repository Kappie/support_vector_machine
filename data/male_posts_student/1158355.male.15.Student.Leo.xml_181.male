I was playing the drums today like better than I ever had and I made up a bunch of cool beats and shit, and I realized, no instrument beats drums. It really lets you exert your stress out of your body. It's my life. I'm determined to become one of the best drummers in history. It can happen. Watch me. Don't say I'm bragging, it's called a positive attitudes you selfish little bastards. Haha just joking keepin the peace, conserve water, recycle, word. Anyways...I saw  urlLink this  today and it made me all rowdy and excited. Is that how you spell rowdy or is it roudy. Whutevur. I don't think anything special happened today, just studying for some tests I got tomorrow. 3 of them! Would you believe that? Oh the annoyance of teachers, giving us tests. Sheez. Ok I'm supposed to mention Amanda...Amanda something, I forgot her last name so I'm gonna make up her last name and say Amanda Greco is cool. That would be funny if that was her real last name but I think it's Genitals or something...confused wreck. MSG'D!!! Oh...that wraps on a good blogger very well, for now on I'll homestar my way out of this damn blogger. So here it goes...MSG'D!!!  'hi, my name is annie, i am a little girl, i died five years ago tonight, i was murdered by man who minute went crazy and stabbed me five times, that man was my father, i have posessed the person who is typing this for me, if you don't send this to 20 people in 10 minutes, to tell people about my story, then the next time u look into your doorway i will be there with the knife i was killed with, or i will crawl into your bed tonight with the knife, i have long black hair and red eyes, i am wearing a dress'...I admire the little children to put their effort into making this. Especially the end "i am wearing a dress"...coudn't have ended it any better than that. Let's see James' response to this calamity. s14z: i dont know if this is weird or not s14z: but i jacked off to it
