Being a catholic myself and going to an uber-conservative church, its sickening. I.e., last week at church there was a pamphlet handed out before mass. The pamphlet was titled,    A Catholics Guide to Moral Voting   . Inside, lo and behold, it read something like:   "Catholics are faced with a tough decision about who to vote for today....bla bla bla.... and for you, the moral, righteous standing catholic, we have created a guide on 5 things that are non-negotiable policies. These were Abortion, Cloning, Stem cell research, gay marriage"   and something else *EDIT:I think it was Euthanasia*,  cant remember. At the end of this law-laying section, it said   "Anyone who votes for a presidential candidate or other political figure who stands for these immoral actions is creating a sin on the same level as the man or woman who commits these sins themselves"    I mean, wtf?!.     The pope himself on the war in Iraq  "When war, like the one now in Iraq, threatens the fate of humanity, it is even more urgent for us to proclaim, with a firm and decisive voice, that only peace is the way of building a more just and caring society,"        The pope on the death penalty    "in cases of absolute necessity, in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today, however, as a result of steady immprovement in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically nonexistent."      I mean, I might be ok with the churchs standing if they didnt try to manipulate the people to vote for Bush. Its just disgusting and embarassing.        PS.    And the man who baptised me (Bishop Michael J. Sheridan) is now the same man who wants to deny me and any other Kerry supporters communion. Cool connection huh
