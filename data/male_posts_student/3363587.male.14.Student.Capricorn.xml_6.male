Yes, I know, you may be bursting with laughter and jumping with joy when you see me venting my anger on this little post here, but LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING!                                      If YOU (********************) don't like something about the BAND, YOU JOLLY WELL COME HERE *poinTs to the ground* AND TELL IT TO US STRAIGHT! BY DOING THIS KIND OF STUPID THING AND BREAKING APART SOMETHING BUILT OVER YEARS, YOU ARE FORCING ME TO SHATTER YOUR BONES AND RIP OUT YOUR INNARDS! DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE? OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT! YOUR BRAINS ARE TOO FULL OF STUPID IDEAS THAT BRING HARM TO OTHERS! WELL SINCE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA, LET ME TELL YOU!  YOU HAVE JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER KNOWN TO MANKIND! YOU HAVE BROKEN UP THE BOND THAT HAS HELD TWO BANDS TOGETHER FOR THE PAST TEN OR SO YEARS! I HAVE MADE MISTAKES IN THIS BAND, BUT NONE OF THEM AS STUPID AND IDIOTIC AS THIS! WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEADS?   WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?   To all the Seniors, and to Mr Poh, thanks alot for all you've done for me and the band. Without you, we would've never reached this point, although this may not be our peak. Mr Poh, all the punishments, all the scoldings, all were worth it. Yes, you DO scold sometimes for the fun of it, but mostly, yes, I was in the wrong. Seniors, all the time you spent in the field with us, all the things you taught us, the scoldings (too.) you've given us, all paid off on April 17th, and even after that you never failed to carry on what you've been doing for the past 7-8 months. You have the band's as well as my utmost gratitude.  As for Mr Poh leaving the bands, I really hope you do find something you can really do and love doing in the future, and may you score with distintion in all your subjects. Uphold what you've achieved in year 1, don't forget it! You have our fullest support to the very end.  Lastly, to all the Majors and past committee members; I have never seen a better system, EVER. You have helped Mr Poh to maintain and improve the standard that these bands have achieved. Without you, this band would have fallen years ago. Thank You.   P.S. You sons (and daughters) of b****es, you will NEVER come to a good end! Die a horrible death and never be remembered! SO LONG! Muahahaz
