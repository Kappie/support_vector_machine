Works begins on my idea of flash version of Kill Bill (I still have to name the movie, but plenty of time for that), or Jamie's gonna want my ass on a silver platter.       Icurrently face the problem of figures, I have a choice of stickmen or the eggs like in Jamie's katana dudes.       2 problems, the stickmen will require a lot more work as their various body parts will have to move... Eggs have the opposite problem, they don't show enough movement, how the hell am I supposed to show a kick? Eggs going in with their bottoms???       Bah...       I'll try and get a trailer up soon for you to look over...       (Just so it'll look pr0, as Jamie likes to say)       Over and out...       James   urlLink  Black Ghost Staff
