Firstly I find it rather amusing and must reply to it but I'm sick of just posting out here when people don't know what I'm talking about. Secondly I'm deleting it from my guestbook because despite the fact that I can have thousands of entries in there before I even need to start worrying about it filling up, it's simply too much of a waste of space for me to leave there. So here it is...   Ha ha,   Not very hard to get around blocks. But you know what; I learned this gettting an education. Speaking of speaking face to face, how many times had I heard you dis Clayton behind his back? Many times. Can you say hypocrite? You shouldn't preach out your mouth then do the opposite. Plus the fact that you Matt are in fact overwieght as well, and the fact that you have your own BLOG to drone on and on with; this makes your call on me being a fat computer nerd null. Hey, guess what I found Matt? A hypocrite. Errol, despite being gay sometimes, is still OK. You think I hid the fact that I drew that picture? No, I didn't. I told Errol about it on MSN.I rip on Errol for being retarded just like he rips on me for being me. So you know what Matt, I would have told Errol all about this if you hadn't been gay about it. Ha ha. Hypocrite. Oh yeah this is the last post I'll be making since my involvement with this has been far too much; since you are not worth my time. ---------------------------------------------- hypocrite  Hyp"o*crite, n. [F., fr. L. hypocrita, Gr. ? one who plays a part on the stage, a dissembler, feigner. See Hypocrisy.] One who plays a part; especially, one who, for the purpose of winning approbation of favor, puts on a fair outside seeming; one who feigns to be other and better than he is; a false pretender to virtue or piety; one who simulates virtue or piety.    First of all, I'd still like to say that I truly have nothing against Jason, but an attack on my person must and always will be responded to. Why? Just because that's the way I am. Once again I must reiterate the whole concept of talking to someone directly, did you physically walk up to Errol and show him the picture? No! Do talk to him in person (by in person I mean face to face, both of you in the same place at the same time, not MSN) when you insult him? No! And indeed you would've told Errol about it. Now how does this make me a hypocrite? How was I being gay about it? Someone coming on my site? Taking shots at my friend (the term friend is used loosely). At first I thought, alright, they're insulting Errol, well I guess they can but I'll let him decide what happens, and that is indeed what happened. I didn't start to respond directly to anything until I was directly involved. I would think that anyone that wants to trash talk me would expect me to respond in kind.   And I'm overweight??? I find this extremely amusing coming from someone that easily has, at the very least, 100lbs over me and also someone who does absolutely no physical activity whatsoever. And indeed I talk about Clayton being a geek, but to his face and jokingly at that. You see...Clayton is a friend...now I know that this concept of a friend is very difficult for you to grasp, but they're something that people that go outside once in awhile and have lives outside of the little box that you are currently sitting infront of right now have. And indeed I have a blog that "drones on and on"  but it's something that I do in my spare time and when I feel like it. I don't make the effort to write in it all the time fool.   Now just to end this all off, fine don't respond to this, makes no difference to me. Just know that if you do, I will reply just depending on how lazy I feel whether or not you'll get a long reply or not. But do it in the comment thing that are just below each message not my guestbook, it'll save me the hassle of deleting them. And a final note Jason, you are now the official Fatty McTubTub Fatterson who is fat. Why are you all this? Because you annoyed me, but I still have nothing against you. -Matt
