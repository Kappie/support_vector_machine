Hmm... this post is far too short for my liking... well in SC news today... i got owned i think 3 times in a row!!! One of em was TvT... and this guy wasnt even good!!! I had my fac coming when he was still making his rax (lol, no1 knows what i mean) and he still won!!... **sigh** too much money maps... on the bright side i own money maps ^.^ then again regular maps take more skill... **sighs again** i need to watch more reps... Yes. I watch reps of sc games... its the best way to get better!!! It hasn't worked to well yet but the summer is far from over!! If any1 ever wants to game then the name is Skyrider86. Ya, that name gets around... so if in 10 yrs u see a Skyrider86 playing some sorta online game or doing anything... its me!!!! :D  Wow... did I mention that Lloyd Banks is too good??!! ... i alrdy posted part of his song "Warrior" but he's just too good... just dl "warrior" or "warrior pt.2" or listen to any of his appearances in other songs like "Victory 2004"... he IS THE TRUTH!!! I was gonna quote some of his lines but it wouldnt do him justice... just DL it!!!  O ya... just for the record... I love the old Backstreet Boys songs!!!... need a good love song, ask me :D  I also transfered alota fav songs from my cds to my comp. If ya want some more good RB then here some good songs that most of u prolly havent heard of:  On Bended knee - BoyzIIMen 4 Seasons of Lonliness- BoyzIIMen Simple Things - Usher (lol... guess im not the first for this one...) Without You - Jagged Edge Never Really Was - Mario Winans Butterflies - Michael Jackson Good Man - RL  These are for the most part either unreleased as singles or just old...
