Fun squared.  So today involved a lot of working.  Actually, it was a good amount of working spread out over an entire day.  But the workload was Tyke's speech.  It wasn't all that bad but it was pretty boring.  He wrote out about 15 notecards and made a boring powerpoint but that was the extent of it.  He did manage to practice like 4 times though.  And that is a lot for anyone, especially Tyke.  If that makes you think that Tyke won't be bumbling through it, you're wrong.  Although Tyke isn't a bad public speaker, his topic is stupid and really there isn't a point to it.  He just has some boring facts and oddball stuff in it.  But he does have 2 pictures that might be found funny.  Tyke was happy with his eating today though.  Some Sundays Tyke just doesn't eat any fun stuff.  But today he chowed down on some Sun Chips, Gushers, ice cream, Cheetos, Doritos, and strawberries.  Quite a healthy day.  Oh, and Tonic Water as well.  Tyke looooves Tonic Water.  Maybe he's the only one.  Well basically his day was spent doing his speech but he did also download some music.  He is starting to think of what songs he wants to put on the cd(s) that play on Prom night.  It's gonna be hard to make that a really really good cd.  Outside input will be used for sure.  Tonight was also the last Refuge.  It was fun.  Tyke is gonna miss doing that.  He has really liked the music and the messages are good.  It is also almost always funny.  And of course, he goes to it with friends.  But since he doesn't go to church his religious experience is sorta stopping for now.  But that doesn't mean it's over.  Just for now it's sorta stopping.  Damn, Tyke and Amed just sorta started talking about some prom stuff and Tyke got excited about it once again.  It is still another almost 2 weeks away though.  But it is almost here.  Phew.
