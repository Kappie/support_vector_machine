As usual, there's a lot of  urlLink horrible shit  going down and the  urlLink war seems to be getting worse , but I'd rather be hopeful right now. Here's something to think about:  "We humans have existed in our present form for about a hundred thousand years. I believe that if during this time the human mind had been primarily controlled by anger and hatred, our overall population would have decreased. But today, despite all our wars, we find that the human population is greater than ever. This clearly indicates to me that love and compassion predominate in the world. And this is why unpleasant events are "news"; compassionate activities are so much a part of daily life that they are taken for granted and , therefore, largely ignored." -H.H. The 14th Dalai Lama
