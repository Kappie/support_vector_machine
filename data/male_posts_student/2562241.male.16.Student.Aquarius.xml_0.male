I spent last night watching .hack//SIGN, an anime, and it looks like I'm gonna do the same today too.  .hack//SIGN says alot about me, my life, my reality, and the world. To put what I've seen short, it's about whether or not this reality is really what you want, is it really the way we perceive it to be? What is deemed "evil" in that anime is not completely evil, and good not completely good. Nothing is absolute. Everything has a purpose.  It gets you thinking, why are you here? What if one day, all this reality you see is completely destroyed? Will that be necessarily completely bad, or good?  I don't know how to describe it, but the anime had affected me deeply, in just 12 episodes! The entire story consist of 28 episodes. Additionally, there are other .hack// series that link back to these 28 episodes. There's .hack//, a manga, .hack//SIGN, an anime, .hack//INFECTION, QUARANTINE, OUTBREAK, MUTATION, the four games, there's .hack//DIVERGANCE, an ongoing online RPG, and then there's .hack//Legend of The Twilight Bracelet, another anime. It's a looooonnnggg story, but it's well worth your time, and cash. It challenges your current perception of what it is, but only if you watch it in the Japanese fan subbed version. The English version just makes the experience horrible, and feel unoriginal.  Go get it guys. Feel your reality melt away.
