I would post a picture but i know people would nab the picture and do stoopid things to it...so if u want one - emails me and i might grace you with one..  went and saw the brother in colchester, the other one also came in from london so dad, rob, ant, mo, nana, yana and lil jacob all got together and had a lovely dinner. Jacob was sweet - hes talking really well now. Everyone was really happy and jolly, shame mum didnt come - things are going a lil downhill in that department - and she inflicts it on herself...  anyway...claires off soon so i'm gonna miss that...Becca was happy to get the big brother results i txt her and i need to do the dormer essay and re writie that one for the stupid gay fucker maughn  otherwise its all good...oh yeah and gem loves my new hair!
