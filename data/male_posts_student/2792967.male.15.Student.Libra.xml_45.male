And when I get one on the phone, I will have to convince them that my problem is over their head and get them to transfer me to advanced support. Then, when I finally do get someone on the phone, I will argue with them about how close I am to the CO, and then tell them to clear the lines by tuesday. AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Anyway, Im off to Vancouver tommorow, but dont worry, Ill blog the whole trip. Post later.
