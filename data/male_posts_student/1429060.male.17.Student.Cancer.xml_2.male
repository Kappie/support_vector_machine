Turns out I am pretty screwed-up after all.       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Moderate       urlLink Schizotypal :    Very High       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Moderate       urlLink Narcissistic :    Moderate       urlLink Avoidant :    Very High       urlLink Dependent :    Very High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    High       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --       Interesting, I daresay. Also talking to Alanna about therapists. Seems that many people I know have seen a therapist once in their life.  Exciting stuff tonight. First yoga class, and I hope that it shall me exciting. I believe that yoga is a type of dancing that is expressed in a slower, graceful movement. Kinetic art. Beautiful stuff.  It rains at the moment, which makes my mood improve. Odd and confused as it is, I despise the sunlight and prefer night and rain. Yes, I assured every person reading this blog that I am a bit off my rocker.  Cheers.
