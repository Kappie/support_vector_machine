First it's the not-finding-a-job thing (it's been a month since I got back from DC now), then I was playing euchre last night and I just couldn't get ANYTHING to come out right, and then I was playing basketball this morning and my team couldn't score any points (until I sat a game out, then they hit three consecutive 3-pointers).  I'm cursed!  OK, probably not, but it's all very puzzling...I just need to figure out how to turn things around...  At least all this "time off" has given me some time to work on things around Grandma's house.  I just finished painting the ceiling of my room (which was a real pain because it has acoustic tiles and you have to hand-paint between each one), so now I'm going to start working on Jay's ceiling.  And the yard doesn't look like a jungle ;)  I've got to call back a bunch of the law offices that I sent resumes to today - I'm definitely not looking forward to it.  I HATE cold-calling and calling about myself; I guess the only consolation is that they don't know me from jack right now, and I might never run into them again down the road (and if I do they probably won't remember me)...
