I have actually gone a couple posts over now, so at this point I am just trying to mark it in some way. I know my posts haven't always been that great as far as length and entertaining content go, but I have been improving. So in result, over a span of more than five months, I have managed to spew out 100 posts worth of stuff, whether interesting or not, and I will probably continue to do so for at least a few more days, or weeks, or months, but definitely not years.
