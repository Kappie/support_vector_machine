I feel so naked without it...I think I left it at the church.  So, if you guys are going tomorrow for church (which I guess you are) could you ask Patty if anyone found a blue cell phone?  I hope nobody stole it...although that'd be doubly awful seeing as I lost it in a church!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
