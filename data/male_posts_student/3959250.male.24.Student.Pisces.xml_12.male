Went to Changi Village after the movie, all might think i ate Nasi Lemak right?haha WRONGG!!! in the end i ate char kway teow plus stingray.still very nice in the end mah so i had a very satisfied tummy...too satisfied in fact that me and my friends went walking around. we walked over to the The Changi VIllage Hotel...went up to the top storey in fact.Wow it was a good view also leh....can see the planes flying past and going towards Changi Airport,somemore very cooling. Hahaha we all also saw a R(A) scene...one of the hotel windows was open and this fat dude was onli wearing a pair of undies and in a provocative scene...haha so scary that we saw that sia...cos we were looking at the courtyard den suddenly see this open window..whew....
