Thing about it is, (something that I have to work on) is that I come here to vent. Rant. Be vexed. Fuss. Contemplate. Mull over. Ya get the idea. I don't come here when I am in all kinds of a great mood. And I'm thinking that I should. Writing has always been my therapy. It is the tool that I use to plaster things back together inside my head. I'm thinking if I start recognizing the lighter side of me, I can lay off on the melancholy a little bit. Not too much now, I'm not trying to scare myself or anything...I feel that I am being redundant at the moment, and this motivates me to get to the point. From now on, in addition to (b/c I think the manner in which I transcribe my stuff is what makes me unique) the usually "hey world, go find a poker game and leave me alone" attitude, I'm gonna try to start relating some of the funny/bizarre/interesting/breathtaking/great cool wonderful things that happen to me.  And my foot STILL hurts.  Weird animal news  Afghan soldier couldn't afford to get married. He ends up being arrested for having sex with a donkey. Desperate times ... desperate measures. A kangaroo viciously attacked a woman in her garden. A bobcat viciously attacked a woman in her basement. Chinese veterinarians are showing a panda American sex ed videos so it will be ready to mate.  Jim Rindhage is a professional dog poop scooper. Bird poop destroying Norwegian bridge. Man dies of heart attack and pneumonia, but police launching a murder investigation because his genitals have been removed and may have been eaten by the dog. Dogs trained during World War II to run under tanks with explosives. Unfortunately, they were indiscriminate about which tanks they'd run under. In Idaho Falls, a cow escaped a farm and had to be chased down by police. The cow cut the tendon of an animal control officer and it made its displeasure with police known: Police Sgt. David Frei tried to herd the cow by driving beside it. The cow rammed into his Ford Explorer, denting a front panel, and then disappeared somewhere south, witnesses said.  I am a lover of fabulous conversations. Ones where neither party is complaining or smack talking or worrying or telling of a recent event, but where a higher level is achieved. Philosophical, if you will. Theoretical, too. Maybe a little bit with the opinions and ideas that are so unique to an individual. Deep breath, and...too the point, I had one of those Sat. night. A good old conversation about God that actually made me think.   My attention is evading my control, so I'll be back to this later...oh boy.   Fabi, lol, wow, I still falling, for like 2 weeks and I am not hitting bottom, I hope I don't I am at terminal velocity between 40.7 to 55.8 m/s... and it is gonna hurt to hit...  Lol, I never think I will!  Riley boi, I heart you!  Much stars and hearts You, you are, oh you are The little boy made for me in the stars In the stars, that's why I can't let you go The little boy made for me in the stars That's why I love you more the further I go And before this existence you were always there Waiting for me You are, you are the realest thing I know Hands down The realest thing I know I am not used to being carried Or being able to carry a pretty song I have been bruised by my many trails Sometimes my skin's so thick it's frail I just need to be ignored 'til I wake up to the beauty that is yours And it all comes to life so, so suddenly This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause All the energy it takes to feel this power I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you I know, I know, I know You're the little boy made for me in the stars In the stars, that's why I can't let you go The little boy made for me in the stars That's why I love you more the further I go And before this existence you were always here Inside of me You are, you are the realest thing I know Hands down...the realest thing I know I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams When you carry me, when you carry me, when you carry me It's so happy I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams
