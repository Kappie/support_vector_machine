Yeah, had one of those today - I don't remember everything about it, but I do remember that virtually the whole thing was just talking with  her , and it was such a letdown to wake up and realize that it wasn't real.  So I promptly turned over and went back to sleep just so I could go back to the dream, so real life could get put on hold for a little while and things could be like I wished they were.  I don't know what it is, but there's something in me that just can't seem to let go, that seems to have a grasp so tight on those memories and feelings that I just can't get them out of my head.  Anyway, I'm rambling on like I'm drunk (which I'm NOT)...  Spanish went ok today (inasmuch as any day with Spanish can be "ok").  I got back my test from last week (the one I pulled an all-nighter for); I did a LOT better than I thought I was going to (I was hoping for a D and got an A ;), but I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that the teacher was really lenient with how he graded them (I wouldn't have given myself any points for a lot of the mistakes I made!).  Not much to report from the Public Defender today; I basically went up, sat in my cubicle for a while, ran over some filings, then came home when they didn't have anything else for me to do.  John said that things should be picking up for me later this week, but then I got a phone call from my temp agency and they said that they have something for me for the rest of this week and all of next week, so I'm not going to turn that down!  But I am going to miss working for the public defender for that time...
