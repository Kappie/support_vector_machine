So at home alone I sit around all day. I am so bored. If anyone reads this before the end of the day that wants to do something, call me. I had to get up at 6 this morning for a saxophone lesson, and it was really embarrassing. I really need to practice more often. At least I think I know which new saxophone I'm getting. Well,  urlLink this is it . I just put those pics there cause I'm really bored, hence the title of this post. Well, I'll add to this later.
