It neither has pain nor torture, Just this certain feeling inside you. It neither has happiness nor contentment, Just this feeling inside that you can't describe. It neither has love nor hate, Just this certain indescribable feeling.  What is that feeling? you couldn't tell whether it hurts or comforts. If the feeling is anger or sorrow, Or if it is love or hatred. What is this feeling that bothers us so much? This feeling that you couldn't ignore. Always there bothering you, Always there when you don't want it to. You contemplate that feeling for as long as you like, You have the eternity to figure it out.
