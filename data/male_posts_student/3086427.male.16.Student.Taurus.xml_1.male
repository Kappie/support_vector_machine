Yep.It's finally over.The Quizbook is finally done,all 1600 questions or 300 pages of it.Went to Pizza Hut for a celebration dinner.In the remote case that you are interested ,it wil be out by July and most probably all factory products wil be required to buy it.  SAT preparation in full swing.Last score 1540,ie 800 in verbal and 740 in maths While verbal scores have consistently been improving,math scores stubbornly refuse to move.Any suggestions??  On a sad note ,I have been called upon to discharge my duties as President of the Gandagi Safai Club.This involves giving horrible speeches about even more horrible topics like Earth Day.The silver lining is that Dimple Kohli,the head Safai karamchari has promised me that nothing much would be required in future from me.Also,Anupriya ,a fellow Safai karamchari and class topper(92%) has handed in her resignation,and i have managed to recruit two more people in her place from the wild section,who have a lot of free time to do Vela stuff like this.  On an another sad note,all the HOD's have stubbornly refused to let us have any free time in school.read going for GSP's and other activities.  Vote for the BJP,or ask your parents to do so.
