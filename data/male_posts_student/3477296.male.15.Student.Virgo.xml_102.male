For all those who don't know it, after 2 hours of panic i have managed to find my geography sheets. Of course now my room looks like a bomb hit it (and no, my room doesn't usually look like a bomb's hit it) and i'll probably be forced to clean it up. But the important thing is that i found them. UPDATE: I am bored NOTE: Nobody blogs here cept me, andy, jack and jono. i think some deletions are in order admin..glares at andy.
