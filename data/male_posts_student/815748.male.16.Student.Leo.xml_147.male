"I saw Fran Lewis there, she was making a pay phone." ---Gaby Bernstein [as] Pat Winter  "Mistah Wintah, you ah heahby deputized!" ---Ben Hodes [as] Sheriff Barnes  "I washed my hands clean... of the DIRT that had been on them!" ---Ben Hodes [as] Pat Winter, explaining what the character did after the murder  "...And then I got promoted!" ---PJ Hannon [as] Pat Winter, continuing the explanation  "It's a case of verbal diarrhea." ---Graham Neray  "It's like the New Hampshire of the South." ---Gabe Gladstone, describing the lax gun-control laws in Florida  -How did you analis - analysize -" -ANALYZE! -Sound it out. ---Andrew Habermehl, Gaby Bernstein, and PJ Hannon, respectively  "She was spilling menorahs all over the place." ---Hiro Tanaka   On other notes, my room is so unclean, almost entirely due to French junk and bedding.  I can't work when it's like this.  I guess I could clean it up partially, but then I just think that it's gonna clean itself in a week anyways.  Idk.  And then there are things that are none of my business.  I like writing you-suck essays a lot more than you-don't-suck essays.  But I'm still going to get a B-.  And, to end, a dialogue that happened at last night's Mock Trials:  Martin Rotemberg: "And you're suing Pinnacle Paper Company for damages, right?" PJ Hannon: "For my husband's death... What?!  This is Massachusetts!"
