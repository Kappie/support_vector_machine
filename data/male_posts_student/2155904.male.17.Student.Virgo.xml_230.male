Well, at least his cheeks look the same.  The skin color is a little different though :).  But Tyke still didn't have much pain at all today.  He was more swollen and you could tell but he hasn't been in constant pain all day.  Just some minor discomfort in the places where the stitches are.  So he has gotten through this surgery incredibly well.  He has been so lucky.  However, because of his laid-up status he doesn't have much to blog about.  He laid around and watched TV all day while eating ice cream but didn't get out of the house once.  He didn't even take a shower.  He watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail again but then he just watched baseball and other programs for a while.  Purdy called him a little before 5 though and asked if she could come over with Ekul and Dotti.  That was cool.  Nobody else has come over so it was great to see some people.  And Tyke hadn't seen Dotti since he got back either so that was really a great treat.  But of course it is always great to see Purdy.  They stayed for about 45 minutes but then left so Tyke went back to laying on the couch alone.  He has iced his cheeks a lot to keep the swelling down but he's not sure how well that's working.  He'll find out tomorrow.  Right now he is taking a little break from lying on the couch so that he can get his blog done.  But in a few minutes he'll go back to lying down and thinking about how great his life could be with one minor change.  Since that won't happen he will just stick with looking like Kanye West for a while.
