See this god damn mother fucking movie right now or you can never see another movie ever again and feel human. Back? Seen the movie? Good.  Bill's monologue about Superman was amazing. The jist of it is that Superman and Clark Kent are unique in the Superhero mythology. Batman is Bruce Wayne. Spiderman is Peter Parker. But, when Green Lantern wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night hes still Hal Jordan. Superman is unique in the fact that when he wakes up hes Superman. He was born Superman. Clark Kent is this thinly veiled attempt to hide amongst normal people. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the nature of Humanity. He is weak, clumsy, nervous and unsure of himself. Superman is essentialy displaying a subconcience sense of superiority for and disdain for the Human Race. Now, this next part is not in the film, but it is mine. Lex Luthor, while evil, represents the complete opposite of Clark Kent. Lex Luthor is the real super man. He is the embodiment of humanity and all that it is capable of, in its balls to the wall and blunt nature. By creating Lex Luthor and his relationship with Kent/Superman represents Man's struggle with what he  is  (Luthor) and what he  wishes  he could be (Kent).  Back to the film. Pei Mei was hilarious! Absolutely fucking hilarious. No joke, I laughed harder at Kill Bill then I did at some comedies I have watched. The way that Quentin Tarantino used the odd filter that created that dated, aged, Kung Fu film feel during the scenes of her training was great. Elle losing her eyes in two equally random monets was perhaps one of the most interesting moments I have ever seen laid to celluloid.  Tarantino has created a drive in me to go out and watch all of these old Spagetti Westerns and Kung Fu films that have created the art form that is Pulp Fiction (hehe, allow me my Tarantino joke).  I reiterate my point. I have seen it twice since it was released (lol, and I watched Volume 1 every day for five days after I bought it so...). It is amazingly worth it. Go see this motherfuckingmovie.    The top Five movies of all time (In no particular order) Pulp Fiction Kill Bill (One movie, dont care what people say. If you have to be a pain in the ass, Volume 2 is better.) Clerks Edward Scissorhands Confessions of a Dangerous Mind   Dont trust me? Go watch  all  those movies and then we'll sit down and debate them all. I can do it for hours.
