Life for me has been so much....that it is kinda hard to explain. Lets see to start it off, my life has been very interesting. Met people that I thought that I would have never know again. During the summer school, I met one of my friends from junior high that I thought I would never meet again ever. We were good friends during junior high, but onceI left my firstjuniorhigh school....I have totally forgotabout her....what a good friendI was. Although we went our separate paths,I never knew that she has stillremember me since junior high...I thoughtI have change...guess not. Now I think that we have become better friends, and it has kinda got me thinking.....is God doing this on purpose for something? I got to realize that mayb God is doing something for me, but I don't know what....who knows. Well I made a very close friend now and I also figure what life is about....well throughmy eyes. I think that life is not about how many girlfriends that you have or how much possesions you have. I believe that life is about having a relationship with God, and for those who are not really religious....just to have fun. Living life to is fullest (in a safe and healty way) is perfect expression that alot of people should follow. God put us on this earth not to suffer and to feel pain. It is our brains that makes us feel unsafe and unsercure, not our heart. Sometimes it is also worrying about what people think....who is the right person for me...or whatever brings us down and unhappy. God doesn't want us to feel that way. He wants us to be happy with our lives and not worry about any of the small details. What you think is good and perfect is the right attidue to have, then you would feel good about urself because it is you who is doing it not somebody else, but be sure it is nothing unhealty or unsafe. Some of the gifts that God have gave us is what we should use to help us out to make our lifes more interesting. For example one of God's gift to me is martial arts...i love doing it soo much. Doing this gift makes me happy and even teaching people makes my day! Anyways using your gifts is a special and should be use wisely and to make you not worry about what peopl think. Whatever the case is not worrying about your problems and just being who you are is the best thing that any person can do!!!!      Laterdayz
