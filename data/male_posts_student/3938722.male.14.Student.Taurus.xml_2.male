Instead of directly supporting a band by mailordering clothing and cd's and waiting a week, kids can cruise on down to the closest mall in the family mini van and buy sh*t from there while mommy and daddy walk around JCPennys.  Hot Topic is no different than American Eagle, Gap, Pac Sun, A  F, etc. because when you get down to it, the companies thrive on deceiving people into blurring the line between fashion and personal identity. People want to become the clothes they wear."   can u sence the truth in these words? cuz i know i can. its sooo true...the only thing is that people tend to not want to see it. i mean, i dont mind the store, but its called "identity theft..."   anyhoo, ill be leaving to san francisco tomorrow for a couple of days... top fun! goin to hang at the wharf and eat fish and chips for 3 days straight. anyhoo, not much to post, exept that i saw saving private ryan for the first time yesterday...great movie, even with the immence amount of "extremely graphic intense war violence and language" that it packs the film with.   todays lesson: Hot Topic is exactly like A! but with a little bit better stuff. and prices, even thought HT prices arent really anything to brag about.
