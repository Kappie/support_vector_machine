I called Kaya this morning...she's coming back, but she was busy, so we couldn't talk. I had a wierd dream about her two nights ago.... I was on 17th and wilshire....and for some reason about 10 of my middle school classmates were there. All of a sudden, I saw Kaya walking, and I thought "aren't you in utah?" So I ran up to her and asked, and when I got to her, she cried out, and began to run. She ran away from me, so I ran after, because I wanted to know why....and when I almost reached her, she turned around, said "I need to be away from you, go away." and dissapeared. I woke up and felt like ?????????????????????????????????????!?!?!?!?!????? it was confusing. I love ya'all ~Elan
