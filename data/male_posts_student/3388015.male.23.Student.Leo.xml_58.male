So Cindy and I are on a blood-oath (well, more like an elbow promise in honor of Laura's sore elbow).  First day is always the most fun: no food.  Tomorrow we'll return to a much healthier eating pattern, well, at least I will.  Miss Cindy will eat anything I throw at her.. which will be much much less!  Plus we're going to the gym more often.  Maybe we'll go after work.  Sounds like a plan.  We'll keep you aprised of our progress.  Cindy gained 5 pounds and I gained 15 pounds since last week.  Hmm.. I wonder if its water weight. :)
