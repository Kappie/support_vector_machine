But in my dream, I also got the grades for next semester's classes that I haven't taken yet.  And in those I got an A, an A-, a B++, and a W.  I don't know what the W stood for.  Perhaps "What a weird dream," or "Wow, you need to stop thinking about law school," or "Why would you be taking new classes next semester if you get 2 Fs (and an F+!!) this semester?"  Hopefully not an indication of things to come, whenever it is we actually do get grades.
