I just capture today in brief:  -->Me and Hann are not talking due to our previous argument. See blog entries below. -->Neither is me and WQ -->There's a EL Mock Exam tomorrow -->In MT lesson tomorrow, I am taking the SS Mock Exam -->I went to the doctor this afternoon, effectively skipping E-Maths Mock Exams.  -->I didn't eat during recess -->I siad I would write this. Wendy screamed at me yesterday on the phone, 'KELVIN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ONLINE? YOU SHOULD BE OFFLINE RESTING!" or something like that. Something like that. -->Someone, I dunnoe who, also likes snow-skin durian mooncake!   Gotta go now. Bye bye.
