After nearly ten months of what has felt like being in labor (although in reality I have no idea nor will I ever have any idea of how this feels), school is out.  Rock on.  People were getting mushy, of course, but...well...I don't know.  It was kind of cool to see the seniors walking around with disposables and video cameras doing their best to preserve every last memory they could squeeze out of our high school, which is fine by me.  In fact, I think I'll bring a video camera to school on the last day of school next year, too.  It's a novel idea, if you ask me.  "A Day in the Life."  Sweet.  Really, though, I only had two official last days of classes today: BCIS (couldn't tell Mrs. B--no, not newspaper's Mrs. B--goodbye because she was still trying to look at someone's end-of-the-year slideshow) and PreCal (in which I took a stupid replacement test on the last day; nevertheless, it was Mrs. P's last day, so it was really bittersweet.  She's been an awesome, hilarious teacher).  I have to go to Spanish and take the final exam tomorrow (and then I'll be through with Spanish at MHS forever!  Woohoo!  Guess I should tell Mrs. C that I'm not planning on taking her class next year.  Hmm...), newspaper is on Wednesday (although we have no final; just planning for next year), and then AP English is on Thursday (I really probably should study for this one, but...well...*whines* I don't wanna!).  The only thing left to do is to get a job.  I have several applications that are sitting completely filled out on my desk in my room, but I have yet to turn them in.  What's holding me back?  Stay tuned to find out!  Same bat time.  Same bat place.
