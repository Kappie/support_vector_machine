Me and times met at my house and drove to columbia and got there at 7:30 when the doors were to open.. when we got there of course there was a sign on the door that read "Sorry, Willie is sick the show has been postponed."  Yeah so we ended up sitting in a bar watching the KU game and chatting to some MU kids..  they were all nice and it was a nice night except for the driving but ohh well that I can deal with.. just got to get studying for my test on Wed..  wish me luck..  Ohh yeah and if anyone sees Nikki (whats the deal with two K's) tell her I won the bet because it ended on the 28th..  good job for me marking it on my calendar..  Just a reminder to all of you, "Zeke knows..."
