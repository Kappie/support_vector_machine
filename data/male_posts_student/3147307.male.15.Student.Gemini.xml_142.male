Nathan Dart's shirt which said, "Don't be an a-- (it actually said it, and I would post it, but others mught not appreciate it, hence the two blanks), vote republican" - he had to turn it inside out though but got away with it for almost the whole day.  9. Staying at Bloomington RPC for the night on Friday cause of the rain.  8. The food. (twas oisome)  7. Seeing Maggie water skiing after one attempt.  6. Going down early to set up tents.  5. My rotation (others complained) I got lucky. 4 ski rotations and 1 1/4 land rotations.  4. The YG sharing time (I tried to share, but I started to stumble on my words and got jittery and then kinda mumbled what I was saying - kinda embaressing, but Kevin, Jenny, Ross, Rory, Katie, and Emily (among others) had great things to share.  3. A great 2-hour game of ultimate frisbee where 13 guys and girls played as hard as possible in the rain and humidity.  2. Getting up on the skis and being able to go until I got tired, instead of going till I wrecked. And I got out of the wake of the boat.  1. Seeing lightening 50ft away from the van on the way down. It blew up a transformer that I had been staring at - very startling! and the thing was it was sunny out so very unexpected.
