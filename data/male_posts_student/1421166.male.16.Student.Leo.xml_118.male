If I was like a few of my friends, it wouldn't be a problem. But in my case, it'll be quite a feat to finish this book by tomorrow. But no point putting myself through such anxiety. What is a small percentage of CA marks compared to my physical, emotional and mental distress? (Basically stress.) So, in any case, I've decided to take it easy. After all, my life isn't about, my expectations and me writing my biography with complete control of the story line. So I'll just let go and let God take control. What difference does it make if I go to SAJC with 14 points (that's if I am able to), instead of getting to a top 5 JC. Even in thinking logically, getting to SRJC doesn't mean I can't get to University. How much more do I have to convince myself since such a reason really does make sense to me? Furthermore, God doesn't look at grades. Will God love me less for not getting below 10 points for 'O' level? No way!If my God is as of such particular a person about worldy merits, what need would I have of him? Do I need another person to act as school teachers, employers, etc.? For the wisdom of men is foolishness to God.  This question I've been pondering about. What is blind faith? Is that such a thing at all?  Is it better to trace His hand with great certainty? Or to trust His heart with great faith?
