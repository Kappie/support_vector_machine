Then broadcasting it over national television. That's not cool. The writers of the series of anti-drug commercials probably aren't thinking of children watching it. You don't want your child who is probably 5 years old and just watching cartoons to see a rated-r-like material commercial. According to me, a lot of stoners would watch Cartoon Network or something like that when they're high. But how can they understand these anti-drug commerials when they're high all day. That gets me thinking that the commerials are supposedly only for adults. But what kind of adult would be watching Cartoon Network? And that brings me back to being high. Only a high adult would be watching Cartoon Network. But they do show those commercials on different channels. So this whole f***ing post was meaningless. Oh, sh**. I'll still post it.
