Routines are interesting, aren't they? When you are so entrenched in something, eventually it becomes a part of you; To the extent that not only is this aspect of drudgery completely integrated into your life, but you can't even imagine your life without it. I will now pull out the over-used analogy of us being robots, automotons going through the motions of life, blind to the beauty that's around us every second.  And yet, we in fortress North America have absolutely NOTHING to whine about. Nice and happywith our houses on the hill, SUVs, 2 car garages, 100's of channels of shit on Cable TV, designer clothes, and fat bank accounts, we forget that despite the conveyor belt we are on, we have one important thing that many people do not have: An ability to break out. We're not starving. We don't have to worry about being shot when we go down to the grocery store. We're not being bombed daily, as part of a "pacification" process to"liberate" us.   Lamenting the state ofour post modern lifeis good. That's the easy part. The next step is harder: We have to do something about it. We have an ability to do something, to enact change, to open other's eyes. Some people call this Resource Mobilization. Well, we can. Moreso than about 95% of the rest of the world. To abdicate this responsibility, to simply throw up your hands and give up, is just as bad as giving in. Far too often, we look at the suffering in Darfur, in Haiti, in the Phillipines,on the East Side, and simply say "That's horrible. Oh Well, what can I do?", promptly returning to our blissful ignorance. If we, who have more ability to actually do something about the injustices of the world, simply retreat into cynicism and resignation, we are just as complicit as those heads of state, those Multinationals, those Trade Organizatons who systematically enforce the paradigm that brings such suffering.  I'm sick and tired of lack of compassion masquerading as "realism" and "cynicism". It takes infinitely more courage to remain idealistic in the face of such uncaring people. The thing is, being idealistic when you have such an ability to enact change actually WORKS.  It falls upon us.  But what do I know? Oh well, whatever, nevermind.
