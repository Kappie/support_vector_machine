But the basis of Lavalon,   the reason it was created, the customs it evolved during the Sovereign   Principality, ceased to apply to Lavalon as the once had. 	Now that our government-revolution has taken place, I would like to   move to restore Lavalon's culture and history. I recommend reading the   following thread at the website, which gives important details of how   our cultural-revolution will take place: 	http://www.lavalon.t9x.com/republic/index.php?  option=com_simpleboard=view=2=83  Regards,  Xon
