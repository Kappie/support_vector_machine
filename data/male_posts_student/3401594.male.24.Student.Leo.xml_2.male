I cudnt quite catch the titles since, am sorry, this was in VCD!  Premise: A movie about "Karuppu Gandhi" Kamarajar. The movie is a biographical account of the leader from his early days to his death.  Review: Individual Events in the movie need not be and cannot be reviewed as such since they are real historical events. The movie has a cut  paste effect of various scenes done in that manner, looking quite disjointed. Probably, the director was hoping for this effect. But i can live with it, since we r concerned abt history and not a 'story'. Retelling 60 years is not easy and the director can be forgiven for the above flaw.  Mathabadi, acting-wise, the guy they chose to play lead is good. His voice-over is by MS Bhaskar of "Chinna Pappa" fame, i think. This guys good. Other actors seem stone faced. Not much acting, probably amateurs. Especially, the lady who plays Indra Gandhi. She suffers from facial paralysis.  But the history holds up the movie.   Worth watching if we need to increase our vayetherichal on the present state of TN politics. Only stale acting is a let down.  ------------  Another movie, I watched was  Jana .  One word: Dont!  Ajith has gone mad, and is probably having hallucinations about his status in the film world. Dont watch it unless u want to endure this as an Ajith fan. Pathetic copy story. Ajith with his non-sensical one liners, as if he were Rajnikant. I dont know when Tamil Actors will get it to their heads that only the Super Star can give one-liners and get away with it. Others, look lame. Thats the only effect they achieve. Sneha is not needed for this role. Radharavi, local villain is forgotten as soon as the intl. terrorist villain arrives. Police Inspector Delhi Ganesh turns PA to Ajith. Lots of holes in this movie as mentioned with only Srividhya doing well.  Rest are wasted.   Ajith, better for him to get into motor racing, though he is not doing terribly good there as well, and spares us his non-sense. Red, Citizen, Anjaneya and now this. Pathetic.    ------------ Meanwhile, a delightful little movie i watched.  Adithadi . No time to write a review. But one word: Must-See. Quite funny with trademark Sathyaraj Lollu all over. It has logical flaws but the movie more than makes it up in humor dept.
