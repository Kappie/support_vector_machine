A resident of Lancaster County, I live on an acreage just outside of Bennet.  I used to drive an SUV, a vehicle that I thought I needed to traverse the miles of dirt and gravel roads that made their way into Lincoln.  But recently I down sized to an all-wheel drive car, and after a winter of above average snowfall, I can proudly say that I did not get stuck once! 	I thought I needed an SUV, and there were times that its big size and above average power came in handy, but I have learned to live without it and as a result the gas prices are not as alarming as they once were.  We live in a super-sized society, where bigger is always better.  In an effort to keep up with the Jones’ our driveways and garages are now filled with gargantuan fuel hogs, whose thirst exemplifies America’s lust for gratuity. 	At the same time gas prices are going up we are fighting a war on top of one of the world largest oil reserves.  The multi-billion dollar oil industry is already well represented inside of Iraq, and has been awarded numerous US contracts.  Some of the terrorists that we are fighting think that we are attempting to colonize them, and while their tactics are brutal and inhumane, one has to admit that if Saddam Hussein was the ruler of Burundi he would still be in power. 	If you want to make a difference in the war on terror the first thing that you can do is demand a new energy policy from your senators, representatives, and most importantly your President. The second thing you can do is demand that automakers build a car that gets good gas mileage or uses alternative fuels of hybrid technology.  And finally you can realize that you the consumer can make a difference in the world by demanding a more responsible level of consumption from yourself and others
