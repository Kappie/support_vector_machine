I have to post real quick b/c I have to get up at 3:30 to see the Pope tomorrow.  I wrote a journal on the plane ride.  Its moderately interesting.  When I have time, I might post something about it.  I love this country.  On newspapers, on TV, on signs on walls, everywhere is stuff about Italy in Euro 2004.  Mmmmmmm... football.  Ain't it great?  Yes it is.  The luggage situation is bad however.  My mum and dad's stuff arrived, but the suitcase full of gifts and my suitcase did not.  As long as my soccer boots are OK and I get most of my new clothes back, I should be moderately happy.  Ok, now I'm off to go and go to bed.  In three hours I have to get up and see the Pope.  Ciao.
