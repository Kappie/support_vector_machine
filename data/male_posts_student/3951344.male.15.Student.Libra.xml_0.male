Sitting here throwing a ball up in the air and then catching it, I realize that it only seems to be a sensical action because I do it. If what existed in the universe looked completely different and did things completely differently, it too would wonder, what are the chances that my actions make so much sense. But you must complete the sentence. what are the chances that my actions would make so much sense to me. There's a pretty good chance of that.  Then you really get it that sense and order are concepts that are entirely created by us, and so have no concrete meaning. It therefore does not mean anything to think, what are the chances that my actions make so much sense?
