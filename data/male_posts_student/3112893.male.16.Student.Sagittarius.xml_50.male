I have a ton of idea to write about during the day and I write about most of them, but deciding which of them are really worthy and which ones to make longer and shorter and then doing so is so long and tedious for me. Anyway, here's another raw brain dump. I took these notes on my  urlLink sidekick  over the course of the day and most of them don't mean anything to anyone except me because I wrote them as something to remind me of the bigger story to tell. Anyway, the post:   Height equality and nation wide ice sticker things. Eaves dropping armchair polititians and running with an idea 4 words long repeated until I have an opportunity to write it down somewhere to write a real post about it. How was it decided that drinks always go on the right and the fork and knife goes where and where? Will to live isn't great for me. I don't really care that much. Stressed spelled backwards. Running out of movie ideas. Sport utilitity ridiculousness, like SUTs, for rizzle. Parking guys who are way too into their job. Halter top for your ass skirts.  As you can see, it's pretty random and meaningless. I swear that I'll do my best to be more entertaining later. I'm sorry, guys :-[.  That is all. -- Feanor
