I don't get to see my buddy as much as I'd like. We've known each other for a few years, yet we only see one another like every few months. I think she's one of my few friends that aren't single. It seems like this summer there are a few folks that are taken. As opposed to last year, when pretty much everyone was single. Yet this summer has been much more wild.  After hanging out for a while, I paid Jim's Music a visit to inquire about music lessons and here I am now at home feeling tired.  Lots of stuff in the news about the CIA and the Bush Administration. I'd just like the point out every country has a weapons program of some sort. However, the Bush Adminstration made it seem like Iraq actually had weapons or the potential to create so-called weapons of mass destruction. Bush's speeches were used to create fear and correspondingly create support for a war that could have been avoided. The pre-war diplomacy was a sham. I remember someone asking me last September if I thought we were going to war, and I said of course. Bush's speeches were as bogus as the "I did not have sexual relations" speech that Clinton made.  **
