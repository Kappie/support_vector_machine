I had intended to set up a dual boot with Windows, so I had a back up in case the Linux install didn't go well.  Also, if I needed to access the internet for drivers and such, I had that ability through Windows.  But I decided to install Linux by itself, just to see what would happen.  I figured if it was a disaster I can wipe and start over with the dual boot idea.  The install was super simple.  The system came right up and knew how to get to the internet.  It automatically updated the software through the Red Hat site, asking me for my root password to make sure I had the authority to change system software.  The graphical interface is very similar to Windows with some improvements.  It's going to take a long time for me to figure out the details.  Since it is Unix based, the command line is nothing like Dos.  All the commands are completely different.  An example was my attempt to get Flash working on my browser.  It requires a download, but it does not autoinstall like it does with Windows.  I have to expand the compressed file, then use a loader program in the command line to execute it.  As it is, I don't even know how to navigate to the file, let alone the actual location of the downloaded file!    But I understand the curve here.  The first time I ran a DOS/Windows PC, I had the same problem, so I'm just starting over with a new OS.  Actually, it is kind of exciting!  I did some reading last night and learned the proper commands, so tonight I should have it figured out.  Linux is peculiar if all you know is Windows, but I see why they have taken this path.  The fact that many programs have to be installed outside of the GUI is a trade for stability and security.  Also, the core of Linux is compiled for your specific hardware configuration.  If you install new hardware, you have to compile and install a new Kernel for your new configuration.  Where Windows stores thousands of drivers in the OS for every possible piece of hardware, your version of LInux only carries what you need.  It reduces bloat and increases stability, but again, you have to be prepared to recompile when you add hardware.  A trade.  So essentially, I have access to my email, internet and chat, but that's it for the moment.  I think I'll be learning something new everyday, which is actually kind of exciting when the computer was becomming more like an appliance as of late.  I'll keep you posted.
