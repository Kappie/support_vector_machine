That means Joe and AL listen up. I wanted to decide what to do early so flaking will not be tolerated! Let us not forget Joes mishap of last year where he chose filly and courtney over his homie. This may also be the summer of redemption. Im letting everyone know, A MONTH IN ADVANCE, that i would love to do this thing on august 4th. Yes august 4th so Lisa can join us. Newport again calls us as i would love the GuppyZ to do some kayaking which means early moning. Then after another deep sea adventure, well end the night at hooters or something. So this is mainly for Al and Joe to see that you have a months heads up cause id really love for you guys to be there. So again, Wednesday august 4th. Edgar, lets me and you show lisa how we celebrate birthdays!!!!!!! Luke if theres a way to finagle a day off that would be sweet. If not we can hang on friday the 6th.  G-Unit
