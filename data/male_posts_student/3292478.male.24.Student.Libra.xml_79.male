New album  urlLink 'Underneath'  is being accompanied with an acoustic tour, and by the sounds of the first single  urlLink 'Penny  Me'  it should be a cracker!  As a fellow Hanson afficianado I can see me  Mr Callaghan having to learn some new songs!!! urlLink    The phrase "voices of angels" comes to mind!!! urlLink
