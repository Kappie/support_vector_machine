Guys would have much less of a problem asking girls out if there wasn't gossip.  I don't hate asking girls out cause of rejection,  I'm afraid of what rumors will be spread after I admit it... ...cause relationships have got to be the juiciest of the things to gossip about.  People should just stop making a huge deal of a person asking another person out, it would make things a shitload easier.  But no, we have to get involved in everybody's lives, and share opinions and usually add in stuff that probably isn't true.  Even best friends gossip about eachother...it's kinda sad really....  All I got to say to sum this rant up in one phrase:  People's crushes and love lifes are their own damn business, keep the fuck out unless you are let in.
