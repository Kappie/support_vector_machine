He stirs and stirs... looks about, familiarizing himself with this all-too-familiar environment, and smiles at how the morning light makes everything look soft, dewy, and innocent... if ever the world, and if ever humanity itself could find that place of salvation in tranquility, surely it would be on a cool, forgiving morn such as this.  Eh, probably not.  I slept funny last night.  I have a crick in my neck.  That's right, a crick.  I don't even know what a crick is... it is either related to the insect, the cricket, or the game, cricket.  If the insect, I suppose I am to assume a cricket crawled onto my face and whistled its little mating song right next to my ear, so I cranked my own head into the bed to avoid hearing its piece-of-shit serenade.  If the game, I would have to assume that this condition is common among cricket players, probably related to the constant torquing of the body.  Regardless, there is a crick in my neck, and as I do not have crickets in my house, nor am I on a cricket team, the only logical explanation for the crick in my neck is that God did it to me.  Oooh, He is always playing Pranks!  Mornings are okay.  I do, however, think that humanity can be divided into two hierarchical castes based on whether or not they can function in the morning.  In Nietzschean terms, we'd be talking about a publicly enforced master-slave dynamic -- but because "master-slave" language is so depressing, I propose a shift towards "Number Ones" and "Number Twos".  Number Ones are people that cannot get up in the morning.  If they do get up, they're pissy.  They throw waffles at you, they refuse to do anything, and even if  you're  trying to sleep, they play they're music as loud as possible so  they can wake up .  These people need to be captured, subjugated, stripped of their belongings, and sent back to kindergarten to learn some fucking manners.  There is no excuse for rudeness, ever.  So listen up, Number Ones, and you know who you are... (and if you don't know who you are, listen to yourself in the morning.... do you ever say: 'I'm not a morning person'?  'Don't talk to me before I've had my coffee'?  Have you noticed people hate you before noon?  If any of these sound vaguely familiar to you, you're a Number One, and under my rule, you're going to camp!)  ahem, as I was saying, so listen up, Number Ones: get it together.  Put your stupid little emotions aside while you wake up, because neither I nor anybody else, not even other Number Ones, find your little rising-sun ritual of being a dickhole nearly as endearing as you do.  That's the biggest flaw of the Number Ones, they think being a bitch in the morning is cute...  So here's some reliable information for all, Number Ones and Twos: puppies are cute.  You, in the morning, are not.  Number Twos are a superior race.  They get up, and they do their thing.  That's the shit!  If they're in a bad mood, they keep it to themselves until after they have showered and eaten.  They do not lash out at the general public, and certainly not at those close to them.   Why then should these gentle creatures be constantly attacked with the morning vitriol of the emotionally weak?   They should not.  It is a crime.  I, a Number Two, have tasted the icy wrath of many a Number One...   And many a Number One has died for it.   I call for a worldwide revolution of Number Twos... let's flush these dastardly morning tyrants down the proverbial toilet.  You know, that one toilet... in that one proverb... about not being wasteful or something.  Regardless, the time has come for me to face the music -- which, by the way, is a stupid saying.  Face the music?  Who needs to face music?  That's why it's music, you don't need to look at it -- and go to my ninja lesson.  That's right.  The Black Blossom is a ninja.  Beware.
