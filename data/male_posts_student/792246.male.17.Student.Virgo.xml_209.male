The entire class except for Brad got C-'s on our last in-class essay, and this week I managed to get a B-! I was actually hoping for something higher obviously, but it's still nice to know I've progressed a whole grade. Brad of course manages to keep his fucking A-'s because I think the teacher has a crush on him.  The nice thing is that a lot of people got C-'s again, and some people actually got an F! So, in a really selfish way, I feel pretty proud of myself. This is Honors English too. Woo!
