Anywho, this pretty much explains it.  "Oh my god. so, in florida here we have this show that airs on UPN at 1 AM called "Live Prayer" Its where people call in with their problems, complaining to a bullshit pastor, and he prays for them, to the lord. Hes basically homophobic, and he thinks being gay will lead to a very destructive road. So, anyway. My online buddy/friend George, lives in Virginia. I usually talk through voice chat with him, and put the mike up next to the tv too. So, I was letting him listen to live prayer, and he decided next time it was on, hed call in, and say he was gay.  So, anyway, i had the mike right next to the TV, and my computer sound recorder ready, and was watching him on cam. So, he had his phone ready, they said he would be through soon, talking to the pastor. And then all of a sudden i heard on TV "Ok, we have George with us. George, what is your problem?"   George:" Hi, yeah, im gay" (Or something like that)  And the pastor talked about how to help him stop being gay. But there were some seriously funny moments. The priest dude asked george to turn down his tv (he wasnt watching it on the tv, just listening to it through voice chat), so george was like "ok" And then I swear, there was the longest pause ever. The priest dude was waiting for George to say something, and George was waiting for the priest dude to say something. George was like just sitting there, and the pastor had the most confused look on his face, and was staring at the camera. Finally he went "George, are you there?"   And George said "yeah"  And then he went on, preaching about gays, and it was the funniest thing. I was trying to muffle my laughter because i was afraid theyd hear me through the mike. And I kept seeing George giving huge "silent" laughs. And he even typed "lmao" while talking to him.   Then at the very end of the conversation, he prayed for George. George hung up by the time he was praying for him through :-P  Then like two callers later I think, some dude called in talking about himself and... GEORGE! LMFAO! omg.  So, anyway. I recorded the whole thing. Feel free to IM me on aim if ya want to listen to it :-P :-D  God that was some funny shit."  Taken from Fedora Black Widow. Shelly's blog.     urlLink   urlLink
