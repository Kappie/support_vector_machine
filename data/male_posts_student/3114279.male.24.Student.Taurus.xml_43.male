      Lucy van Pelt: Maybe you have pantaphobia. Do you think you have pantaphobia?  Charlie Brown: What's pantaphobia?  Lucy van Pelt: The fear of everything.  Charlie Brown: That's  it !!!  I'm pretty sure I have AdultADD. I took the online quiz. At the end of the quiz it basically told me I can print out the results and take it to the doctor. Actually it seems kinda borderline. I have always had trouble paying attention and sitting still. I already know I have Social Anxiety Disorder. Thanks to the Zoloft commercials and their television quiz. Maybe that is why I love my job so much: I'm just a grown up version of a lot of these kids. As part of my job I get so many free visits to a staff psychiatrist, and you'd better believe I'm taking advantage of that. I've also been told I might be Quirkyalone. Is there medication for that?
