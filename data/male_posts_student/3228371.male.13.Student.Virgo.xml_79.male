Then, I spent the whole day at home talking to Jay on MSN. IngiEE came online for a while and then left. We're officially the "gummy bear trio"~ Haha! IngiEE's gummy bear#1, I'm gummy bear#2, and Jay's gummy bear#3~ LmaozZ~! Funnyness. Funny love, gay love, love love~ LMAO!   So bored... Oh, and Godfrey told me that Marcos moved out so they don't live together anymore. Congratulated Godfrey. LmAozZ~! Now I feel kinda bad for being so mean to Marcos. Oh well. Blah... I'm so bored... I'm making stars. =) I'll learn to fold a rose someday. Well, I'm hungry so I'm going downstairs for sushi~ Bye bye!
