I suppose I thought that this simple action would force me to do something productive with my daylight hours. The theory was partially correct. Though I did not find a job I did spend a lot of time with my little brother which is always a productive use of my life. I also went to the beach and played with sea anemenes. Later I went to a "variety shop" where I purchased some contraband. Tomorrow. It will all happen tomorrow.
