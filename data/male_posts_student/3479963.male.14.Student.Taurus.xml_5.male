I did not plan to tell anyone about this blog that I created, it's different when your friends come to read your blogs, it seems odd to me, hope no one finds out about this blog... hee hee. Iam sort of crazy over this girl in my school, but I wont say it out, Its all right to have a secret admirer, however its not right to have one at my age, mum's nagging again..'GO and study!!' Haizx, cant i just take a break, i did it for the past two hours, eyes tired already. Wonder why there isn't any shows on saturday evening.
