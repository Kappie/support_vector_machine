I didnt even know what I was doing until I got to the auditorium. As it turned out, I was taking part in a safe schoool program and we were showing what NOT to do at school. My part is to sexually harrass a girl and to fight w/ some guy I dont even know just for the hell of it. I know this is supposed to be good for the school, but they should have asked me if I wanted to do it 1st. I guess they chose me because I am good at acting (so i've been told) , but it was still pretty rude to pull me out for the thing. Especially since they had a whole week left to get a person. I know that there are tons of people in the school who are dying to get up on stage and get noticed. But hey, this counts as school service and I need some, so I guess I can't complain. The rest of the play is funny as hell.some girls get in a cat fight that looked so real at rehersal that the sponsor broke it up. then there is going to be a scene where this guy an dgirl are approched by a group of other girls. They think that she has been talking crap about her them, so before it gets ugly, the guy w/ her broke them up. The leader of the girls says " hey ...............hwo dis yo?" so the girl says "that's my boy ya stinkin queefer!" So they're about to go at it when a girl in the audience goes" oh you did not just say that! That is  my man and if you think he's yours than you got some problems girl!" I think you can tel what will happen. Anyhwo, the rest of the show is really funny. Just wish my 10 readers could see it.
