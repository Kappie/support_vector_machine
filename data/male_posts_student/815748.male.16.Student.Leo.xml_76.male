And my mother has like complete control, grrr.  There's a Mock Trials meeting tomorrow, and I want to virtually finalize my direct before then.  This means that if Matt Zimmer is reading this, get your head in the game.  I would post my direct, but I know how much enemy MT-ers read my blog coughJuliaRindlercough.  Things have transpired as regards the thing, but I've pretty much stopped waiting.  Either things are going to happen, or I'm going to take the initiative again.  And Loren was even disapproving of that style, but time is running out, and things will happen soon to restore the natural order.  I love inside jokes.  To finish off, here's one more inside joke and two Ken "I don't do anything at Mock Trials" Zhao quotes from Model UN:  Mack Ryan Records's new marketing drive: milk boxes with "Get Ready for Jody!" on the side.  Ken Zhao: "...namely, uh, some countries."  Ken Zhao: "We have a lot of Buddhists in our country, and, uh, Buddhists are very important because, uh, they are very religious."
