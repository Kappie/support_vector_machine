So here’s some catch up… Thursday night I went down to San Diego with  urlLink Nai  to catch the  urlLink Keane ,  urlLink Matt Pond PA , and  urlLink Aveo  show at the  urlLink Casbah . It was a fun little trip. We got some  urlLink In N Out  prior to leaving Irvine and watched planes land outside of the venue before the very late doors opening (8:45 ish). The show was good, despite the first few songs Aveo played making me think the openers were going to suck. But when they changed guitars and the girl got off stage, so they could play their older songs, it got a lot better. Matt Pond PA was really good (despite the lame name). They had a cello that really accentuated their indie-sound. I think bands like  urlLink Yellowcard  should learn from them, because sometimes their electric violin gets drowned out or isn’t fully used in some of their songs. The cello was there in the music throughout Matt Pond PA’s set. I think they’re the first indie band in a while to really impress me. Keane was good too. I honestly don’t think I would have liked them if they weren’t in a small venue like the Casbah. I think the comparison to Coldplay is kind of unfair, but I can see it. Anyway I just really don’t think that style of music translates well to large venues. I don’t get why people spend $50 to see bands like Coldplay in stadiums, and people are saying Keane will move up to that in “6 months.” I don’t even think that Weezer, as much I enjoy them, translate well to large venues. Live music has to be experienced up close so you can see and feel the energy from the band. That’s not something you can do in Section 3, Seat G27.   Here are some things that have been on my mind lately.   I read an interview lately with  urlLink Randy  in which they said something about them not liking capitalism and preferring anarchy. I don’t know what the band means by anarchy, because it is a term that connotes disorder. Indeed disorder is an order that is alternative to the capitalist world order; however, realistically if we look at stuff like food production… the world is pretty fucked if all “order” and capitalist organization breaks down - there will be starvation. I think a redistribution of political and economic power is better... not necessarily in communistic or socialistic ways, but in ways that allow for growth without screwing others over.  ***
