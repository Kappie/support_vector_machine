Right the story is that I get up to do a Sunday morning paper round (at roughly 6:30, a bit harsh, I know) and when I finish I get my ass straight back to bed. After watching TV of course :D  Now, this morning, it was raining, and I didn't take a jacket (I was thinking of going back to get one, but I couldn't be bothered and my round isn't anywhere near my house) which made me want to get back to bed more.   I got back, no problems, I watched TV, no problems, I went to sleep, no problems. Then about an hour and a half after falling asleep, I was RUDELY awakened with the sound of hammering below my room (I've got the only room upstairs), now, I tried to ask them to stop, but they just said 'it could be an all-day thing'  It wasn't, they've finished...  I..was...pissed. I knew I couldn't go back to sleep, so I had to go downstairs, away from the hammering. Then there was nowt on telly (see a previous post), in the end, I resorted to watching WWE (I was very very bored)  Now I'm knackered, but I wanna stay up late(ish) tonite to watch Swordfish, on Channel 4 for any Brits reading this:)
