Mostly, I've been at university - the first semester has now ended, the second started (for me at least) today. A whole new group of modules to get through - Principles of Computers, Database Development, Systems Analysis and Design, and Principles of Visual Programming 2. If those titles sound scary, then you're not as much of a nerd as me (who is?).  In the time I haven't spent studying, I've been working on my other website, at www.alltheusualsuspects.co.uk. It's down at the moment, because I'm now hosting it on my own server and ummmm, I kinda broke it. Well actually I didn't break it, just overlooked something EXTREMELY stupid. I've been trying to install Gentoo Linux on it, because I wanted a nice, clean installation with only the basic tools I need. So, I spent a couple of days downloading one of their LiveCD sets, which are meant to make installing and configuring a cinch. They do work, by the way. Unfortunately, I downloaded the version customised for Athlon XP CPUs. Why unfortunately? Well.... I made the daft mistake of failing to remember that while my main system is indeed powered by an Athlon XP, my Linux box is NOT. It is, in fact, powered by an ageing Pentium III chip. So the 2 days I've spent trying to get Gentoo to work have been in vain, because I was a dumbass, basically. The problem will be rectified when I finish downloading another LiveCD set, this one customised for Pentium III chips :P Oh well, nobody's perfect. I suppose I could have gone for the basic version and saved myself this problem - but given my very basic knowledge of configuring Linux, I figured, what the hell, customisation and optimisation can't hurt (hopefully).  Anyway, that was me going slightly off topic. Got so much to think about, I'm just talking bollocks. The website, when I get the server box back up and running, will look just a tiny little bit different from the version you've seen before. As part as my goal of world domination (well everyone's got a dream, right?), I've commenced writing my own CMS (Content Management System) for it. It's by no means finished, and it's certainly not as polished as the professional ones - but I don't care, cos it's mine! And it gives me the opportunity/excuse/whatever to get my head around PHP, which so far has been great fun, if occasionally of the head-scratching 'why the hell isn't this working' variety. MySQL is running as the database backend behind the whole thing, and that also has proved to be a confusing, yet ultimately rewarding experience.  What can I say, I told you I was a nerd!  If very little of the previous couple of paragraphs has made sense, you're probably not a very technical person. Don't worry, it's not for everyone. There's other things I'm not nearly as good at - I'm sure.  At the moment, projected timescale for getting the server up and running ranges anywhere from 2 days (probably absolute minimum) to about a week. It could be longer, but I reckon I can get it going by then, with at least the basic features of my site there.  In other news, I painted my bedroom. It's nice :) It's actually wrong to say I did it, cos I only started it, my grandad did most of the work - he was complaining that I wasn't doing it very well (see I told you there were some things I couldn't do :P) and took over the job. It's a bit of a pit at the minute because we're waiting for some nice new beds to be delivered. Could be up to 3 weeks until they get here though, and at the minute I have a mattress on the floor - around which is a bombsite, which I have plans to tackle tomorrow. Wasn't my idea to make this much mess, it's just cos I had a load of stuff under my bed out of the way, and now.... there's no bed to hide it under. Never mind.  Anyway, I think I might just sign off now. This has been pretty much the longest post I've ever made to this, or any blog. Soon the functions of this will be moved across to the other site though. I'll stop in more often for a while anyway, just to keep everyone updated on what's happening.  Bye for now!
