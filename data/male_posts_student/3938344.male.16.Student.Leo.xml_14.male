I, while walking around with that girl (you should know which one by now, I've written 2 posts before this relating to her) saw one jackass in my class driving by in a golf cart (he works at the golf camp).  Now, I expected him to, at the most, wave to me and call out some kind of greeting before driving away.  I mean, after 2 years in the same class as me, he should know better, right?   Wrong!  Walking to and from my work, we were accosted by this asswipe, who proceeded to talk to us for a good 10 minutes each time.  AAARRRRGH!  I'd worked months to get to even that point, so I am thoroughly pissed at him.  Unfortunately, she was right there, so I couldn't even make a horrifically violent death threat.  Damn.    Of course, if that bastard (or any of the other dipshits in my class) tries to nose in on my action again, I am not going to settle with threatening to carve out little parts of their small intestine while pouring industrial-strength acid over the wounds.  They are simply going to get Ol' Faithful (read: switchblade) in the brain.  It saves a lot of energy and time, on my part.    Now I have to go, I have an entire day ahead of me.  I'll be back later.  I know you'll miss me, but you'll just have to bear the pain of separation.
