At present I am in a school IT lesson. - There's no one for me to talk to as most of my freinds are either in different classes or lying half-dead on a sofa, dribbeling onto the fabric. meh - at least I'm, not. Yet. Unfortunatly (for me) I had finished all the stupid little ECDL tests last term. This achievement was awarded with... ermm... I can't describe it. Perhaps it is written AAARRRRRRRR, and spoken loudly and raspingly. You probably don't get the picture. Oh well.  In fact, daring to do somthing as terrifyingly techie as use the internet is likely to get myself shot in my currant surroundings.  Ah, as I thought, somone's noticed - bye.
