Gave him a chance to play in basketball team again  yet he still takes it for granted, tis no the 3rd time... yet tis is the 5th chance tat we have gave him.... Yet, he shows his gone damn fucKinG BloodY attitude.. As if the whole world owe it to him.... My mum  dad are really in a sorry state now.....especially my mum, who constantly worry for my brother.... whenever i see her in tat sad state, i can't help but think why my brother dosen't change a single bit..... We lay down rules for him so tat he could  return back to basketball.... yet he dosen't really follow them.... still shows his fucking attitude last nite.... my mum got really pissed off while trying to call his teacher in charge  the sch.... but all she could get was no answer.... Damn fucking retarded the school.... i still can understand if the teacher turn off their phone, but no able to get through the school phone is another matter.... Now she is off to sch to find my brother.... In another few days time i am about to start sch.... i wonder how all tis problem at home are going to be by then.... all i could do is pray tat it ends soon...... So much problem like tis, yet my brother of mine thinks tat tis is all nothing.....
