The dance is the first matter worthy of discussion. Daniel went around asking every girl he saw to dance with Andrew. And almost all of them said no but they would dance with me. I ended up turning 5 people down. That was really weird. Then this one girl met me.....It is a really long story I don't feel like getting into, so I'm just going to leave her out of this post, but bear in mind we were walking around with her in six-flags as well. From the dance, bed. Andrew picked up some girls at the dance. That Temple is a real pimp, he had 5 girls following him and T-Love around. They gave him their phone number and everything. While we were in Atlanta we came to love DMX. I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go.......Inside joke, but anyways, we tried to get Will to add that to his farewell speech..He chickened out. I guess it was the five-thousand people he had to present the speech to that did it. The mall was fun (I got a book and a CD), and half our club got stuck on the subway. That was hilarious, there was one girl pressed up against the window nearly in tears as the train drove away and they were stuck....Sad, but like I said, funny. Six-flags was probably the best part of the trip. Daniel Ayers got his pants pulled completely down in front of about 50 complete strangers, but that's a story to be told in person. Justin, Ponder, and I went around riding everything. On Superman, we kept trying to spit on each other every time the ride turned. Daniel met a lot of black people, and believe it or not, found one he liked. It really makes you think that there is still hope left for this world, does it not? So, after much walking around and making complete idiots of ourselves, all that came to an end, and we returned to the hotel to partake in our favorite hobby, elevator joy riding. We would go to the top, and then come down, and no matter how many people were on there, we would throw our arms up and yell "Whoooo!!!" the whole way down. Today we packed and left for home. On the way I discovered a rising freshman and a rising 8th grader like me. I don't think I'll comment further on that matter. So the trip came to an end, and we all said goodbye to all those crazy people from other states we met. It was a good trip, but I'm not sure it compared to the Orlando trip. So this post comes to an end. I'm out.
