I clicked on the first site that popped up, then left my computer for about 30 seconds to get a can of pop.  When I came back, terrible things had happened.  The site had installed many things on my computer without my permission.  1)  It changed my home page without asking. That's happened before, so blah.  No big deal.  2) It installed two toolbars in my Internet Explorer, and hijacked my search engine preference.  The toolbars would not go away.  It also began generating six pop up ads for every page I browsed, even reputable pages like Fox News and CNN.    3) It installed a taskbar attached to my Windows Taskbar that would not go away.  It was some integrated search feature.  4) It installed icons on my desktop for Porn Dialers.  5) It filled my favorites folder with links to Porn sites.  I started hunting these things down, and most of them would not uninstall.  Some had to be remove with registry edits.  I ran Ad-Aware, which searches for Spyware.  Spyware, if you aren't familiar, are programs that run in your computer that monitor where you surf and send that data to marketing companies, who then push pop up ads to your desktop relating to what sites you like to visit.  I had last done a scan a few days before this event.  Ad-Aware found over 300 pieces of spyware!  It took several passes to remove it all.  My computer is still not acting correctly.  I still get pop up ads and occasionally IE will change the page I'm viewing with no prompting.  Bam, it switches right in the middle of my reading.  Aside for descending into a Howard Dean rage, I can't do much about it.  So this weekend (or sooner) I'll have to completely rebuild the hard drive.  Not the end of the world, since my data is not stored on my OS drive.  But still a pain.  In retrospect, I recall lowering my security settings on IE recently while trying to get a Java program to execute.  I'm sure that allowed this to occur.  I wonder about people who do this.  Do they really think this is effective marketing?  I know they just try to generate traffic to sites in order to sell banner space, and being able to show high traffick numbers helps those sales.  However, the companies buying that ad space should understand what is happening.  The pop ups were mostly for legitimate products, sold by known companies.  And just when I railed about the freedom to advertise!  But at least I can take comfort in knowing that hijacking a computer is a little different from sponsoring the Super Bowl.  Be careful with your surfing.  I can't imagine what this would do to someone with little to no computer savvy.
