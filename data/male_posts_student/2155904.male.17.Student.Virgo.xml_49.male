But it is something that hurt and was one of the loneliest feelings ever.  I hardly wanted to get out of bed and wouldn't have if my mom didn't make me help her clean dishes.  Then I took a shower and I still felt horrible.  So I got on the computer and just sat.  I left my away message on but just sat there staring at Kaley.  Then I wrote her a long letter about my feelings.  It was so hard to do but still it satisfied me just a little.  Then, with my heart racing I printed it out and put it in an envelope for her to read.  Then after waiting around for a while I finally balls'd up and got the courage to push the send button on my phone.  I called her, hoping she had a minute where I could come over and simply give her the letter.  That was really all I wanted to do at that point.  Just give her the letter and then leave again unless she asked me to do something more.  But I called her and her voice message picked up so I left her a message.  Hopefully she will call back soon for I need to leave for Seattle for the night in a little over an hour.  I am so nervous.
