So that means all I have to do is write the damn essay. The downfall is that I misunderstood what my essay topic was to compose of therefore it is completely wrong and I have to go back and find what they want. But that is kool b/c today I am doing nothing so I figure I will just do all of that and get out of my way. As for my social life today I am sitting here whoppie what a lot of fun. I am going to help Alison with her summer reading tho. WHich should be a lot of fun...NOT she is really stupid so I already know I am going to have to explain things to her like over and over again. Anyhow as for Michael I am completely over him. So GO ME. BTW....     Fuzzy Wuzzy Was A Bear. Fuzzy Wuzzy Had No Hair. Fuzzy Wuzzy Wasn't Very Fuzzy Was He?
