I had bought a used copy of this casebook at the bookstore, and I remember thinking it wouldn't be a big deal because only a small section of the book is written in.  Sure enough, it's the pages we have to read from now until thanksgiving that are marked up.  As I started reading today, I was holding out hope that the former owner's margin notes would be perhaps marginally useful -- but about three-fourths the way down the first page we have to read, after the book says "some regulation of policing is essential to a free society," in the margin, this person wrote "regulation good because otherwise people crazy."   Yes, clearly this will be very useful... oh well.
