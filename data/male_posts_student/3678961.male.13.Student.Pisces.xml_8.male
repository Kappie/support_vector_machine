Which is why I'm not going to take the time to do it.  So anyways, I'm going to start ranting (or posting, whatever you kids call it these days) again starting today.  All is well in northern New York. The wannabe punk bike-gangs are still riding the streets, the imbeciles are still yelling at me, and the rednecks are still rednecking. Nothing too interesting, at least not worth blogging like the lawnmower incident. But those types of things start happening when schools starts. A lot.  In the meantime, it's time to go to H*R. NEW STRONG BAD E-MAIL TODAY, I think.
