"The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al Qaida is because there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda," the Republican president told reporters after meeting with his Cabinet." -Reuters  All this despite the reports by the 9-11 commission and most reasonable critiques of US foreign policy post 9/11.   I'm not sure what to do, but blaming people isn't going to stop suicide bombers from killing innocent people.  "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Bombers killed 41 people in two strikes on Iraq's fledgling security forces Thursday, stepping up a bloody drive to sabotage plans for U.S.-led occupation to give way to Iraqi rule on June 30."  And of course there's the 9/11 commission that determined that our air defense systems  urlLink weren't prepared for the hi-jackings . I'm not sure how to take it. It seems to me that no matter how advanced our systems are -even if we had some fucking Death Star in orbit of above the continent- it wouldn't actually prevent people from attacking our country  in the first place .  Okay, I need to pay attention to the spellchecker. It changed "Qaeda" to "Quaida." That's pretty stupid. I can understand not recongnizing the former, but why would it recommend the latter?
