There are tears in your eyes I just want you to smile you say your alone ill be here for awhile I might not exist I might not matter But i'm here when you need me youll see i want you do you want me? We both cried  when we lost each other and when i got back you were with another better then me and smarter then me and i dont wanna stay  Jack without Sally Im sorry, truly you say you are too. but memories just dont go away they just stay and make things worse so much time spent was it all in vain? You have slits on your wrist  whilest i yearn for a kiss and you claim no one wants you yeah im here for you always Jack without sally yeah im here for you always Jack without Sally
