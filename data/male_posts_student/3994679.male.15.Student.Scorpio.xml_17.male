Woke up at eleven, got online, talked to people, took a shower, went to lunch, came home, played Joe in Raw Deal, and now I'm back where I started: Talking to people.   Yesterday wasn't much better either,I was in my mom's van all day because we were driving back from Indiana after my Great Grandma's funeral.   Using a line from Jay in VH1's I Love the 90's. Later, you *bleep*in' *bleep* bags, see you in ninety eight.
