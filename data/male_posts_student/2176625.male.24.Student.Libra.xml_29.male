To make a long story short she    proposed    after telling me 4 months ago that she does not want to spend her life with me  when I proposed to her .   Working 2 full-time jobs is harder then I thought. I don't need the money but I need the experience. Also, I'm looking into IVY LEAGUE schools. Why settle for a UC? I want to return to CA to be with family, friends (and that one woman) but my education and career come first. My mom and Vy-Mom are encouraging an IL institution and as of late I couldn't agree more.
