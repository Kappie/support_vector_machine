The buyer company was buying the seller.  And we had to read our facts and think about the open issues in the deal, and negotiate to an agreement.  The negotiation itself was actually pretty enjoyable -- a fun exercise, certainly.  The week of reading the documents and facts, not as much.  But it was fine.  It followed last week's arbitration exercise, which was to the litigation department what the negotiation exercise was to the corporate department.  Basically, a quick introduction to what their work is like.  In a stylized way.  Next week is our catch-the-typos week, when we learn what life is like in the word processing department.  :)
