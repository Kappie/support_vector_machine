Let's see :  I have to do homework, pay my bills, etc             I want to : build my pc, make a new web site for myself. Draw, write, surf the net.             I told people: make them web sites, help them build computers.   I want to start building web sites for a couple of people, whenever they get around to actually purchasing a web host. With out that, I will not start on a site. Computer repair/building is an always ongoing topic with anyone I know. My web site.....is just a dream for now. So this is why I need my time machine, it doesn't have to be a DeLorean, I could use my truck. That would be ok.
