"Awwwww, how sad," said Mack, an orange weasel witha giant chipped tooth and red stripes, "remind me to cry after I stomp your ashes into the ground!" Just then, a giant robot hand shot out and grabbed Noire, "HEEEEEELLLLLPP!!" she screams. "Hold on... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!" screams Sa2b as he is belted into a far wall. Soon everyone has left an imprint in the walls, except Hobbes who had cowardly jumped behind a dresser. "HEEEEEEEELLLLLPP!!" Noire screams again. Suddenly, Hobbes' eyes start to darken. "He's going feral!" exclaims Sa2b, who is picking up his teeth that had come loose. It's true. Hobbes had the ability to snap and go crazy at will, but usually only when he's  really  mad. At this point, he had only one thing on his mind:  Who are you, cutie?  His eyes became slits, his fangs got bigger, and 3 inch claws came out of each finger. The hairs on his back stand up, and he lets out a loud, "RAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWRRRR!!!" With a couple fast slashes, plus a couple bruises, and robot go BOOM! Hobbes then returns to normal (if you can call it that). He then is tackle-hugged by Noire. "Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I thought I was a goner!" "Umm, your welcome, but could you please stop choking me?" "Oh, okay. Maybe I'll just do this." Then she kisses him. Hobbes just sits there, bewildered. Usually, he'd be trying to put the moves on Foxy. He's never actually met someone who  likes  him. "Um," says Noire, "did I do something bad?" "Naw, just give it a bit to sink in," explains Sa2b, who had replaced his teeth. Just then, Hobbes flies through the roof. "WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! I"VE GOT A GIRLFRIEEEEEND!! YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHH!!" "I guess he does," says Noire.    THE END   -Sane Intolerant-
