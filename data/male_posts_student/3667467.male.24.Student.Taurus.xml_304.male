In the meantime I might just start writing ahead. so for all of you FREDLINE NEWS fans--thanks, mom!--there's more on the way. The other day I went to the University of Buffalo for some research, and found a crappy newsletter called The Journal of Truth, or some crap like that. It was crap. I could make better crap than that, and in fact, I already do. Maybe I should print out FREDLINE NEWS and enlighten the inferior competition. We've already defeated Edline News, in what will prove to be our Poland. The Journal of Truth already looks like France. AHH Ha Ha Ha hA!
