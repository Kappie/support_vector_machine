Yet I cannot complain about it to the fullest extent because then I would be steriotyping.  Yet some steriotyping is necessary and good, so long as the person who is steriotyping gives reason.  But I don't have time to give reason.  My attitude reflects the attitude of so many others.  I can't say like who, though, because then I would be steriotyping.
