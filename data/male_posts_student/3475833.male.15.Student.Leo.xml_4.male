Right? Hell no, I went and got rid of a few things and it went to hell. Not only that but... I dunno. I gotta talk to Josh. Hopefully he can salvage it.... It's not that friggin' hard.  Bleh. I hate it. I need to get to sleep too. I keep depriving myself. AND I never got around to reading. Bleh! I wish school would end. Then I could stay up all night reading. It was a good day tho. Can't complain.  What I can complain about tho, is that fact that Akron U turned me down for post-secondary. GRRR! I hate french. Because of the 'C' in there I didn't have a 3.75 cum avg. DERN! I wanted to scream after I found that out. And apparetnly, I've came to a revelation, Alyssa is smarter than me! Who woulda thunk it. I know this already, don't have to tell me twice.  I'm a little weird on some stuff she talked to me about tho. I dunno. Nothing big. I just didn't see it. My problem, Not yours. Unless you happen to be Alyssa reading this. Loo. Then I think maybe they would involve you then.  Oh hey! Tomorrow is Amy's grad party! Yay! I can't wait. I love that girl. She's such a sister.  This is a lot longer than I thought it would be. Oh well, I guess that's why I call it the Abyss of Words. Abyss, never ending. Hey, Wanna know something? I love Alyssa. Just thought I'd point that out. Loo, i'm sure it didn't need it, but oh well.  Eh, Nothing else to say, really, or, at least, I can't think of what I was going to say. More to come later. I think this is more than I've ever written before.
