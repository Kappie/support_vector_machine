I haven't precisely decided how to use my friend's and enemy's names. Should I make up different names for these people? If they found this blog, should I care? I don't know, but I sort of want people to know about it.  As for the beginning of my summer. It has started off pretty well! I went to the mall yesterday and forgot to pickup khaki cargo shorts. Not like I don't already have a pair, but they're wrinkly. I hate wrinkles and clothing that hasn't been worn at least once. I'm picky. I can't believe I forgot. I did pick up a book, Lab 257, and a video game, Project Gotham Racing 2 (PGR). I've been meaning to pick that up, but I was busy when it came out. The original PGR was by far my favorite racing game ever. The sequel is a huge step up, but it can be extremely challenging. It definitely tests your patience.  Tomorrow, I am supposidely going to see The Day After Tomorrow and go out to Ruby Tuesdays with my family. But a friend also invited me to a Halo session Monday night, which I obviously wanted to attend. Not only for Halo, but to get out of this house. I know, I left it on Saturday and Friday for about 6-7 hours total, but it'll drive me crazy soon. At least I get my driver's license on June 2, I can leave whenever I get the urge. I haven't told my parents about the Halo thing, because I always doubt it will pan out. I also heard something about paintball, but I've never played and don't have the equipment, but I never miss an opportunity to make an ass of myself. I'd like to go to that too, but I don't know when that is either.  I am a bit confused. I am also planning on opening two web sites over the summer. I am halfway done with the first one (it's much smaller). It allows you to select and change your online mood. It'll also all you to add people to your mood "friends list." So whenever you change your mood, or just visit the site, you can find out how everyone's doing. It sounds easy to do, but it's more complex than you'd imagine. The other site is a bit underwraps now, it's a combination of Neopets, Tropico, and Grand Theft Auto. I'll keep posting!
