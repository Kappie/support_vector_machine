I say most because their are those few out their that feel it inside them and have that strong feeling that covers their whole spirit.  I may be a bit of a romantic but love is more than a feeling.  I is a force itself that is meant to be shared.  To show love is to express your inner most self and simply communicate with someone.  Love is such a great and powerful gift that we were given.  So fellow teens, love does not have to be physical, not in the least bit.  Just talk and let your spirit set free to share.
