In Michigan, the temperature has always been no more than 65 degrees and gets pretty chilly at night. I hope the summer heat will be coming soon. I want to go swimming! My family hasn't even opened up our pool. We usually open it over Memorial weekend, but being how retarded the weather has been, we can't. On a lighter note, I watched October Sky last night. I started it at 12AM and it ended around I think 2 or 2:30AM. I really like that movie a lot. It's such a gloomy movie but in the end it gets all happy. I have to go to work today around 5PM, so I'm really looking forward to that, note the sarcasm. The only reason I'm going to keep working there is I get paid extremely well. $8.50 and hour, and I work about 3-4 hours. Only twice a week too. And there are no taxes taken out. So every week I get paid around $45. It's exciting 'cuz I can actually buy stuff w/o asking parents. And, my mom actually had to borrow money. That made me feel happy! Still hoping to see TDAT and Spider-Man 2 soon. I think my dad wants to see both, so maybe he'll take me...
