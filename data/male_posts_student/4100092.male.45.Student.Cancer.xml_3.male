As a matter of fact the only campfire I ever experienced was standing around the trash cans they lit in the neighborhood.  There was this one time when I was about eleven-years old, but that involved a field, the fire-marshal's son, a book of matches and some youthful curiosity (which was a really bad combination); this most certainly is a story for another time.  For this camping trip we would take as many provisions as humanly possible.  Our truck would be so loaded down that we looked a little like the Beverly Hillbillies.  Even with all that stuff we would always invariably forget something.  It seemed no matter how prepared we were it was insufficient.  We were lacking in some way.  There are times when I am given to stress all that I do not have.  It is the nature of compelled humans to gripe, as much as it is in our DNA to live in a constant state of discontent.  The pressures of life seem close in and produce the same sensation as claustrophobia.  All the things we have to make our lives more convenient and yet none of them can deliver us from both what is inevitable and that which is really needed.  I have always laughed when I think of the analogy given by Douglas Adam's as he helped point to this conflict.  Douglas infers that all we really need in life is a towel.  In the story "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy he informs us that a towel is "about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have".  You can wrap it around you for warmth or wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat.  You can even wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes.  As Douglas Adams so poignantly puts it "any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, win through, and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with."  It is not silver or gold, nor car or plane, simply a towel.  This same idea that we don't know what is important can be seen in the scene from Steve Martin's "The Jerk".  In a despondent moment his character says "all I need is this chair".  These analogies help remind us that "what's happening" is often "not what's going on". There is more to it than meets the eye.  There is more happening around us, we easily lose perspective.  There is aneed to reclaim the right perspective in the process of awakening.    I am often asked why it is that I do not panic over deadlines.  Why it is that I seem to be able to look the most fiercest dog of the corporate world eye to eye with little fear.  Is it arrogance?  Is it a lack of intelligence?  It is an awareness that my most ardent adversary is simply human, he has no more power over me than I allow him.  I see that my most severe trial is only temporal.  I carry a keen awareness that "this will pass" and that I really have more than I need.  The nature of that awareness and the well of that provision is beyond me, it is most certainly relational.  I often speak to skeptics about this "luck" I seem to have.  If it is coincidence (and I think it more providence than not) than may I be on the right side of chance as much as I can.
