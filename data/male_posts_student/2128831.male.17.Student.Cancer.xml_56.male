I am the one who will hide and I will be the one to die without tears, for I am that boi."  Words spoken at alow that seem fitting for the feeling of depression lurks on all shadows  What Can Be Of The Most Use To Myself/Others? What can be of the most use to myself and others? Why do I even have the need or desire to focus on such a thing? What can be of the most use? What the hell does that mean?  Use = benefit. Okay... what can be of the most benefit to myself and others?  What I really want to say is... what can be the most benefit to others and how can I provide that? Why? Why is that so important to me? What do I care how others' lives can improve because of something I do? Where does this urge come from? Or is it that I really just want to care for myself?  Do the turnarounds: "What can be the most benefit to myself and how can I provide that to myself?" Is that more accurate? Let me sit with that  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  (still sitting)  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........   Intellectually, as I review my life, it seems my life has been a mixed bag of doing things for myself and doing things for others. but there is an uncomfortable emotional charge that comes to the forefront as I reflect on my relationship with others, myself and with life/reality itself, and it seems that this is mostly due to the fact that many, many times I felt that I was giving more than I really wanted to give or not giving when I really wanted to give, and sometimes not receiving as much as I wanted to receive. So with respect to the question above, "what can be the most benefit to myself and how can I provide that to myself?” I can see how that is really relevant. in fact, I would say that the most dominant source of discomfort for me has occurred when I haven't let myself be me, and almost always that was due to fear of what would happen if I did. So I had this double whammy sensation going on inside me: the discomfort caused by fear itself, and the discomfort of restricting something inside me that wants to come out, something that really felt good at its core.  What I had was tenseness on top of tenseness. Not a great experience. Let's do another turnaround: "What can be the most benefit to myself and how can others provide that to me?" Does that ring true? Seems like it does, and pretty loudly at that. Many times I’ve looked to others for appreciation, comfort, etc. and to be honest, I felt the discomfort the moment I acted on the impulse. What I felt was the sensation of emptiness, a hollowness or pulling away from the center of my chest because I thought that I didn't have something that I was supposed to have, or at least desired to have.  There was also the sensation of being at someone else's mercy that sense of hopelessness and helplessness because I believed that someone else controlled my life.  What naturally followed was the tentativeness in my behavior, the "walking on egg shells", in an attempt to "do the right thing" in others' eyes so that they would give me that appreciation, comfort, or whatever it was that I was seeking from them.
