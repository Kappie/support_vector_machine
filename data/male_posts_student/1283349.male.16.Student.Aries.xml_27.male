Yesterday I gamed from...oh, 1 pm to 1 am. Rawk.  And at the moment, I'm just quietly enjoying myself, reading some bookage, listening to some moozic, dreading the next week of school, and plotting to buy Dynasty Warriors 4.  Just picked up the Tome of Horrors, an utterly badass monster-adding-supplement for d20. It's seemed to include all my favorite monsters that weren't put into the monster manual. Despite the $30 price tag, I believe it's money well spent for the 500 or so monsters included therein.  Amanda, post something! My brain is empty.  -Dice Squirrel Mellow Like Jello
