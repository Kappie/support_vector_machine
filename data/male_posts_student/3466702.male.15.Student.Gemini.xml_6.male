Her son bootlegs movies and cd's. she is a lawyer.(i thought the apple didnt fall far from the tree.) her other son is in the army. he got this phat azz truck with some 26's that keep on spinning. 3 tv's and this loud stereo system.man.that was the tightest truck i have been in in a while. but any way, we went to the mall like we always do when i come over here. i am going to kj's tomorrow to get me some girbauds and some other stuff. it comes cheap when you know the man that owns the place. well that about all my sunday was cut out to be. except for the fact that i had to watch 4 bad azz baybay kids while they were here this morning. omg. they so damn bad it dont make sense. they keep running and running and running. then they eat and run some more.i thought i was gonna pass out when they came in the door.i had just woke up and here come the freaky four comin through my door. well i will holla.                             *This blog is finsihed*
