In the morning, I went to the polyclinic to look at me leg again. Sigh. I knew waiting time's gonna be long. I am almost finish with book 1 of HZGG, so I decided to bring the second book along!   Aha! I was right! I even have time to read 70 pages of book 2. I don't know how much time elapsed. Definitely more than an hour. Yeah.  Well, the doctor was friendly. He's such a nice guy! Oh my my! After that, I went out and was passing by some chairs when I saw Mdm Matthews. She apparently turned her head at that moment and saw me. He exchanged greetings and I went on my way.   Hmm. CQ and I met later. His house was on the way ma, and we are going to the library. Just so coincidentially, we met Gloria while going down the escalators. Heh.   It was a mad rush to the library! The food takes so long to be cooked!! Sigh. Luckily, we managed to grab a table on the 1st floor. We studied Chem. Heh. I was the tutor. I felt so proud of myself. :P Nah, all of us are equally good.   Okay. My cheng qie act still continued. And today, CQ informed me that if I was to call myself cheng qie again, he would be forced to call me *ahem*. Right. That shut my mouth up. *Shudders at the thought* Well, not for long. I became nu pi. Servant. :P Okay. My nonsense still carries on, with pleasure. Heh.  Right. I am also teaching a class on "Overcoming Your Shyness!" for CQ, Gloria and WQ. They are terribly shy! Aiyoyo! I am up to  Chapter 1: Bring Out The Confidence! . Then all of them went off to do their own things. Eating, devotion and whatnot. Sigh. What a rowdy class I have. Naughty pupils!! So adorable!  Right. Now I have to go back to a new fic I am reading.  urlLink Time Out Of Place  Yeah. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
