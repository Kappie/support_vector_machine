Oh and not to mention senior pages. OMG don't get me started on it!! But anywho, I promised funny stories from what happens to us, and well by gaw I'll give you one!! This happened to me actually. But of course most of this stuff normally does happen to me anyways! Anywho, I get to school and go inside to sign in and get my ID card or whatever it is. I brought my almost a year old German shepherd with me to get a few pics in with her. We go inside and walk into the cafeteria and I wait to sign in and watch everybody else's pics get done. As I do this I hear faint squirt noises behind me. I don't really pay much attention to it. But, I really should have!!! Because next this gush of a nasty aroma fillsthe whole cafeteria andall of its occupants noses!! I turn to look and there is my lovely dogstanding beside her enormous pile of poop that she hadjust laid. I have never been so embarrassedin my entire life!! Well there was this one time...but we won't get into that. I had to clean up her non-shaped pile of poo with paper towels. It was so disgusting! Iabout gagged on top of it!! BLAH! I was of course angry with her but then I realized that she had had a stressful day too because she had been cooped up all that morning at the groomers. So I apologized and gave her a hug. Then we went to go get our pics done together. But yes, it was rather gross and yet I find it to be so hilarious!! Welp, band campis coming up soon, so expect more to come from that!!!  This is Micaela, *signing off*
