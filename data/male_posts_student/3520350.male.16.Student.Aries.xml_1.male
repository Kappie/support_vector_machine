What isn't realized is that is all one can do -  patch.  band-aid.  duct tape.  But  there will always be a mark. There will always be a scar. There will always be a reminder of your past.  In short, pain never goes away.  And each time we're hurt, that takes from us. Our personalities are very rarely affected by the positive  in life, mostly, because humans expect it. We not only want happYness, we feel we deserve it. So when we get it, we not only don't cherish it, it barely even effects us.  Only the negative leaves a scar.  So throughout your life you have a certain amount of strength - a fixed amount. Non-renewable. A gift card of sorts with a fixed amount of it. And each time you get hurt, each time you lose in life, that amount is depleted. One, two, three, four, and your strength ebbs, and you're always  slowly losing at life. You're always being depleted. You always scar.  And so we live out lives, becoming more and more cynical, becoming more and more hurt, some retaliating  by not caring, others rejecting society, still others creating beauty to try to stop the world from scarring further. Nothing - none of it, works.  And one would hope to have nothing on the card at the moment of death, but it never works out that way. Some have something left at the moment where their soul goes to God, and they die fighting, trying to draw one more breath because there is still life within them. Life, so to say, hasn't killed them yet.  And some people lose it all before their physical deaths: their souls die. There is nothing left for them, and these are the recluses, the suicides, the cutters, the burners, the maimers, the killers, the punk revolutionaries ... those without hope.
