My aunt's mother has Alzheimer's disease and is in an assisted living facility.  They apparently had a seder there earlier tonight, and hid the afikomen, but no one remembered where they hid it.  I know I shouldn't find that funny, but it is funny.  (For anyone wishing they knew what I was talking about: part of the Passover seder (seder = meal) involves hiding a piece of matzoh for people to find later (the piece of matzoh you hide = afikomen).)
