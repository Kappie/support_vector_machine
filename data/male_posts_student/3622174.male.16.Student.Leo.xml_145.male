Will it be good to the point where it will be a great day, or a day of infamy because of my brother?  We'll see.  Speaking of him, he got up this morning and was like "I need a map, where do I get one?"  And I'm like "Well, I thought you would find it yourself."  I gave him my map, but, he's dumb enough to not be able to read it.  Oh well.  That's it for this extremely short edition of Blog of Bagel.  I'm off to school in a few minutes, so, for those of you still on summer break, may god bless your soul, because you truly are the lucky ones.  Bastards.  Oh well.  See ya'll this afternoon!
