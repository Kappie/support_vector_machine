So when Mr Lowe sendsthe 2nd Grade Table Tennis teamto Ashfield to vs Epping, when instead we were suppose to go to Normanhurst to vs them, semi-final fever has no effect. The result is that we are now kicked out of the competition, never to find out the result from an otherwise disappointing season. At least failing to turn up at a venue gets a dismissal at 1:10 and skip Period 3.  "grr First Grade and John Chan with his C200 Merc Transport vehicle" The only way we probably could've made it to Normo in 5min was to fit a Rocket out the back of Starlings V6 Beast and an AMG sticker on the Merc. "Jet-powered Teleporters is the way to go" But with obvious depleted resources in a government funded school, one could onlyfind a CD version of Job Guide 2004. Gone are the days with that chunky-newspaper book.   And yes lets introduce an update of 'Its a Girls Life and We like it'  In yesterdays episode, it was found out that infact, not 2, but all 4 girls had bought the same prom dress as each other! *audience wows* And they were arguing whether makeup would suit the dress, and if the seasonal shortage in rainfall was caused by El Nino (yes im serious).  Todays episode, AsianGirl tells of her sudden disbelief in astro star signs, quoting them as 'dumb' (Vocabulary is limited to using 4 letter adjectives).What will the girls do to convert AsianGirl back!? At the end of the episode, an ad comes up saying "Girl TV was proudly brought to you by Bratz" They even have their own plasticine doll lineup, to re-enact that "Shocking moment of Stars are DUMB!"  And Mabel...I just happened  to flick the TV on at 4:22.
