So that was cool, and I won Shemnue today, and already done one disk of Shemnue 2 which is good.  Me and Dave got a valentine's card today, there was alot of effort put into it, we even suspect it was hand delivered (no address on the letter) and there was a chicken in the middle, and it's beak opened and closed as u opened and closed the card. Most impressive, and it didn't say who it was from, weird... but expected from Valentines cards, lol.  Well, I'm being kicked off the computer right now, by a certain self proclaimed Jammy Bastard, Dave, who at this present moment in time is "doing the worm" on the carpet *roles eyes* Bastard.
