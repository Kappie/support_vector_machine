When I woke up(pretty early) I went to the store to buy dinner, where I meet a friend that I hadn't spoken to in almost one year to the dot. We talked for a while, and then we decided to go to the beach after he'd finished work. So we went there, myself , my friend, and three others. I got a few jokes on behalf of my blindingly white skin, but I just laughed with them. I hadn't been to the beach in about 2 years before I went yesterday, and it was certainly about time! The water had a good temperature as well. So we threw some american football, frisbee and we did a little volleyball too... All in the water of course. Then we just sat down talking for the last 45mins. When we were done we went to my old school where they have a sandvolleyball-setup. At first I sucked pretty miserably, but I got a lot better after a while, and I got a whole new perspective on volleyball. Which is that it's actually fun! But as always when I play volleyball, I got an injury. In stead of one of my thumbs which is usually most likely to get hurt, my left bigtoe was roughed up a bit. So I'm hoping that it'll recover for when I'm going to play tennis today.  My parents came home from their vacation last night. They thought I'd been very good with watering the plants(!) and they brought me two killer t-shirts as a present. So it was good to be home. Letterman was unbelivable last night! It was like the best episode of Letterman EVER! Well, some episodes may have had better jokes, but last night's show kept it funny throughout, which made me very happy.  I have to get ready before the bus comes now. See you when I see ya.  Song Of The Day:  Pretty Girls Make Graves - All Medicated Geniuses   Late.
