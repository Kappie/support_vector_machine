But I just feel like giving that place sometimes. I will not be doing anything fancy to this blog, let not for now. No extraneous sidebar content, no fancy layouts. Just the default template and my words.   Working and going to school is for the birds. I don't understand how people do it. I am enrolled fulltime in art school and I just began working for Gap. Inc. (See how I made it sound all official and stuff?) So anyway, I had a 2 hour Color  Design class yesterday, and work immediately afterwards. I worked for about 7 hours until 10pm. then i had to be back at 8 in the morning to work until 5. My feet are really killing me. I don't see how people do it. this is really gonna kill me and it's all my fault. I keep volunteering for hours because I need the money, not for school, school is free. But I have bills. I'm kind of an adult with responsibilities and debts. And I gotta eat. And be online. And commute, etc.  And they don't pay much by the way.  More later....  (See, I could never post shit like this on my regular page.)
