I made a couple of business and pleasure calls as a result. Business as in getting shit ready for Vegas.   It's almost 1:30 AM and I've gotta pick up the rental car at 8:30 AM... woohoo... running my body into the fucking ground still. My body is really gonna love the 100 degree temperatures in Vegas combined with booze.   Anway... back to work... it had its moments since Julia stopped by before she takes off for training in Florida. It's cool working with Tania again also. They're funny girls. Of course they're usually laughing at my demented sense of humor. Yep... demented. I mean I joke about old people dying, marrying corpses, and the boss working on his "pipeline" report in the back restroom. I'm gonna make a fine professor one of these days.  Viva Las Vegas!  ***
