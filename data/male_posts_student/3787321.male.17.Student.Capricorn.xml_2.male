I did not do well for mid year i got 2 A Level pass and 2 AO pass, i was able to meet the criteria but i was beinf forced to drop my fmaths, lucky i was given a chance to prove my teachers wrong. It seems that Jc lifes is too stressful. Much worse with the sickening PW work that i cannot imagine that i have to spent 50% of my time jus for the sack of a mere 10% of Alevel results.  Couldn't be botherd with it. ALL I WANT NOW IS TO WORK HARD FOR S PAPERS.......i am hoping for a SAF SMS scholarship if i do well.   Took part in the national swimming championship, my timing deproved got last for my 200m breasts heats and an average results for my 100m breast.Took a lot time then to mug and domy work and I PRAY EVEN HARDER TO HOPE FOR EVEN MORE LORD'S BLESSING.  I couldn't go down for my sch NCC training as they have switched it to Friday when i am still having sch lesson. It's pathetic and i am not sure about how they are doing but i am hoping for a good results back.  Knew that Hafiz and farhan were posted to bv i was so happy it's seems that it's better.  HEY NEED 2 STUDY PHYSICS NOW MUG MUG MUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
