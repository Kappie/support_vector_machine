You're probably thinking that as a teenager my problems are trivial and unimportant, and you may be right, but goddamit im gonna write about them anyway, and maybe ill tell you some more about myself as I go along. Ok, im not particularly happy right now, and there are a couple of reasons. Lets make a start. Firstly there's my job. I work in Woolworths, im sure most people know what that is, its a shop that makes most of its money selling colourfull plastic crap to children. Oh, and lottery tickets. I work on a till mainly, thats the standard job for someone my age. This means I get to sell the lottery tickets, the amount people buy amazes me, i know the money goes to good causes and everything but when you think about it its still an awfull lot of gambling, not that theres anyhting wrong with that but ive never agreed with it. I just dont see why you should give someone else your money, maybe its the scottish in me. Anyway, my main problem with Woolworths is the way then handle overtime, I signed up for a saturday job, that means saturday only, but as soon as they found out that i had finished school for the year they start to give me more hours, now we're not talking a few here, we're talking the whole damn week, they want me to work full time! But heres the real bitch, they have a board they post the hours on, what happens is, next to every employee the write the hours for each day, and you're expected to do them, there's no query first, you just do them, and if you actually get up the nerve to go and tell the manager you can't do a day, you get dirty looks for a least a week. So im stuck, these guys are taking away my holiday, and theres not much i can do about it, especially as im one of those people who cant say no to anyone. I don't know what to do, and this isnt the only problem long hours are causing me, but thats for another post. I hope the above made sense.
