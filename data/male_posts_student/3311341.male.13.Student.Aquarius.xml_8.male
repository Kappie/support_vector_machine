I spent a couple of hours in the battle dome, today. I upped my percentage of wins to about 81%. I still need it to be above 90%. I wonder how all the people with the good pets get so good... I guess it takes loads of discipline, which I lack. I'm sad about my life. I'm pretty hopeless for what I have left to do. I get bored with almost everything, and I get mad at people for little problems. I need help   urlLink This  is my brother's journal... He doesn't update his as much I do. But he probably started like this.  Are journals supposed to be depressing? I feel like I'm not writing about anything good. Sorry about that. Email me with your comments, at Gandrolok@hotmail.com(opinions on my journal, only, please)  My brother went to a prom alternative with the youth group. Everybody keeps asking him how it was and stuff but he says "Alright, I guess." He's strange like that.  He babysat us while my mother and two sisters were at their dance recital. I didn't like him as a caretaker. He yelled alot and was extremely careless, and kind of selfish(not to say that he's a bad person, just not patient). Gar, how do people type so fast. I've spent all day editing this post to fit my schedule, and what I've done. And I guess I'm done for now.
