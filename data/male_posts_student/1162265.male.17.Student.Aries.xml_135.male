Oh well, it's a method of speaking, but I can't write currently.  I've seriously contemplated writting a million things, but I can't, something is eating away at me, and I really don't know what it is.  It's like this burning sensation down in the pit of my stomach.  Damn, I really need to just do something pointless.
