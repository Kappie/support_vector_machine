I just spent few minutes going over what is so different about it compared to PDA and the only major difference is... TDA uses a touchscreen instead of using handwriting recognition. Hurray! Whoopee!  It's interesting concept but I rather see the product in action myself rather than believe in hype... You can find more information about it below...   urlLink Jackito-TDA official site
