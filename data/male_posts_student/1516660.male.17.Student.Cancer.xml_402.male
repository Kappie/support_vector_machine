Before that, I made a bet with CQ. I will treat him ice-lemon tea when I passed and he fails. So, even if both of us fails, he will get one ILT. Unfair right?   Yeah. The results are as shown: CQ gets 2 bottles of ILT. Yep. It means I passed and he failed! Actually, I did not pass the way I liked. I got 47/100, but I want to get 50 and above. To me, 50 is considered passing. Sigh. Even the Ice Lemon Teas are gonna get sold out soon. Meow moo meow!  Okay. I also found out my MT score. I got a B4. Cheh. One of the lowest in class. HaHa!   Right. After that my PW group and I went to Boon Lay Primary to interview the vice-principal. Yeah. We went to collect the results from YuHua Primary.  Heh. The interview went quite smoothly. She brought up even more points, and I am very glad for that. :D  Okie. We went to Mcdonalds for lunch and analysis of our results. Heh heh. Lets just say our surveys are very satisfactory. Very statisfactory indeed. ;)  Okay. Me and Kelvin took 187 back. It's a 50 minutes ride back home. Yep.  Okay. I go watch Nip/Tuck le. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
