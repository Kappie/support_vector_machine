The relatives are here from California  I suppose I should be upstairs talking to them, but I'm going to be going to bed soon anyways and I really wanted to update everyone who doesn't read on what I did while I was gone for the last three days.  I make myself sound like I'm in a bad mood just there.  I don't know what I'm thinking right now.  Sometimes I think I type just to fill up space.  The same is to be said about those who talk to fill silence.  We are one in the same, I think.  Well, on to more uninteresting things.  So I went to Chicago, the windy city.  It wasn't very windy on any of the days.  We went to the aquarium, the art institute, the John Handcock building and the technology building with the omnimax theater.  I think we went to some other places but I forget.  It was fun the first day, but then I got amazingly bored the other days.  I'm not sure what to say about the city of Chicago in summary, but it was a good break from the norm of my summer.  I haven't done the song of the day in a while.  How about that?  Today's song of the day is: "In My Place" by Coldplay.  I suppose I will go to bed now.
