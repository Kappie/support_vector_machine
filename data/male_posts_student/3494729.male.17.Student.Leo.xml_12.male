I think I got my ass thoroughly kicked by the SAT II tests yesterday, but I cheered myself up by stopping by Best Buy and adding The Starting Line and the newer Something Corporate CD to my ever expanding punk/pop-punk CD collection, and by popping my awesome new Pac-Man antenna ball onto my car. Good stuff.  -alex
