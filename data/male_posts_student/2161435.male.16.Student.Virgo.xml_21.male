Some of those security dudes were harsh, they threw some of my mates around and stole one of my mates! Capdown and the AKA's rocked too! Although I thought capdown were alot better than the AKA's, but they were really good for supporting bands. But the bad thing was I came out covered in beer, water and ice cubes down my top. But it rocked!! \m/ Anyhoo..I'll shutup now. Today I had my literature exam, it sucked monkey butt because I didn't manage to finish it all :-( it's not right that we only have 1 hour 45 minutes to write 3 essays...grrrrr! I really hope I didn't do really badly. Tonight I'm watching the last ever friends god I'm excited. I'm getting ready to cry already...and it's 3:20pm!
