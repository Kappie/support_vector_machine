CME lesson wise, what we did was just to complete the page where the CONDUCT is on, and have sentences formed from each letter of it.. and talked about racism.. blacks, whites, yellows, niggas. blah. our maths cum form teacher is going off for NS reservist soon, so we'll be having a relief teacher from now on.. duno until when, but i kinda look forward to his teaching...  Today was a real rainy day man, rained twice in the afternoon.. and i got a bit wet from the rain around 2.45pm... but yeah, managed to get a cab to go to CS, before the real stuff came... phew..  Actually wasnt planning to go to Century Square today, but since Kun Long and Kenneth were going, i tot it might be good to join in the fun too... kinda hate boredom these days... otherwise my mind will think of all sorts of things again.. sigh..  Played WMMT and ID v3 today, but again, its mostly WMMT... i got my timing on New Belt Line to 4'43... super happy, to top it off, my R32 in ID got its shomaru time reduced from 3'11 to 3'10'876 in the first run, but the second one was a real pleasant surprise.. a 3'05 !! a great leap !! Uber happy today !!  After that headed to Popular in Tampines central.. since the one at CS was too small and had nothing to see ard.. headed to the hp shop where Sherman asked for the price of T630.. wah.. drop again... need to pay $280 only if i traded my 3100... not the $318 before.. We bought 2 EA classics, and got 1 free. but we shared the price equally among the 3 of us.. since each taking 1 game... and i bought a box of CD-RW and DVD-RW too.. made full use of the 15% discount NKF voucher... haha...  Went back home to see doc, guess what ? they start at 7... i got there at 6.35.. decided to head home first, den go see.... come back, wah the crowd was like so many.. waited from 7.20 to 8... den see doc.. the doc was like pampering a small kid sia.. keep patting my arm.. and showered a lot of "motherly" care on me... whaha... but good la... better than one dao one.. hehe. Been sick for over a week le.. den see doc..  Btw, Bought a box of rojak home for my parents as a surprise, but they didnt really appreciate it.... or so i suppose..  When nearly reaching my house, suddenly 3 sms came at the same time, making my phone ring a big big beep. was wondering... got 3 pple send me sms at same time ? rarity leh... but all came from Karie.. she was like all urgent about getting a extra hp for her fren... but i think she got too urgent, and scolded me vulgarities in the last sms, say i didnt wanna reply.. i was like har ? O.O"?? Then i msged her on MSN... she, as per usual, was kinda the not interested to talk to me... with a tone that friends doesnt use.... i wonder, wads her purpose for doing this.. i see her blog, was like all happy and stuff, but to me, shes cold as ice. or maybe even colder. sheesh. i doubt Saturday i'll be off to the movies with her and her friends... since, i'm the only one, and i'm kinda short in that gang too, i suppose. bleh, one step at a time ba... -.-~  Well i hope shes cooled down, my medicine doing the work, and everything's gonna be OK tml... had a very happening Tuesday.. just like last week. oh, forgot to mention, yesterday was the first week old of my blog.. haha.. 1 wk, and this much crap le..lol.. blogger can tahan anot.. i wonder... Ok la, i'm off to do my things le, and to sleep early tml...   Man.. all this blogging... kinda takes up a long time.. this entry took like.. 40 mins ? i'm getting burned out here... saw the article.. on burned out of blogging.. disturbing the normal rhythm of pple's normal routine.. i guess i'm one of them too.. but i'll try my best to blog everyday, and whenever i have the time.... and not to be this lengthy, haha. >."
