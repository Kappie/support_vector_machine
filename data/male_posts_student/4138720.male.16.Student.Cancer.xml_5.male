Especially when I get in trouble for my hair being to long in the first 5 minutes I'm there. Honestly, what's up with that??? 1) My hair is not to long. 2) Could you at least let me say hey to one person before I get in trouble? 3) I'm not going to cut it anyway, so why waste your breath? On top of all that, I have almost 2 periods of nothing. Yes, nothing. 6th period I'm getting out of Spanish to be a "teacher's aid." And 7th period I'm in a class that I took last year so I won't be doing anything but playing games on the computer. Talk about patheticaly easy... Well I don't really have anything else to say. I'm looking forward to tonight and this weekend. Life is so much easier when you can drive. Peave out... War in
