Let's mic former President Bush, sitting in the first row, visible on every pitch, but not mentioned until the 4th inning.  Or how about showing some computer-generated fireworks every few minutes?  Or "Skippy" or "Snappy" or whatever the animation's name was showing us how to throw a slider?  What about some graphics about all the players' favorite breakfast cereals?  How about airing the game in 3-D?  Or HD?  Or as an MTV music video?  I don't understand.  Just show the game.  Relax with the special effects.
