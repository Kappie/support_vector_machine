I am tired of every baseball announcer using the words 'of late.' Why don't you think of something else!?!? Say lately or something. But do not use the same phrase over and over!  I bought my sister this CD a long time ago and I never listened to it. I was at her house yesterday and I made myself a copy of the CD and it's pretty good.  Finally, if it is my time to die then it is my time. What does it matter anyway? There are 6 billion people in the world, why does it matter if I die anyway?
