He's an alright guy, but he has a new girlfriend every 6 months, heh.  He's also a Vietnam war vet, and he's told me some stories.  Like, stories you don't go around telling people.  I saw Dan Keesis there, too.  He was bussing tables, and we talked a bit when he was free.  What a worker.  Funny, he asked 'Where's Kim?', much like everyone else.  Well, except the broker guy.  He asked 'wheres your girlfriend?'  and I hadn't even told him anything about having one.  Guh.  So I had to explain what was best:  "You guys are too lame for her." XP  It was good food.  Ummm... I didn't do much else today.  I wish armyops would let me log in!
