I first saw her in Strawberry on the Shortcake, though she's been in other things since.    Rina's got the "girl next door" thing going on, even for those of us who live quite a few doors down the block from Japan. Insufferably cute, tantalizingly innocent, and yet convienently street legal, Rina's got all the "jail bait / buddy's attractive sister" taste with none of the calories.
