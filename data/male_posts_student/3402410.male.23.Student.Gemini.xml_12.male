You'll recall I purchased upwards of fifty compact discs during that period. I attributed it to trying to fill the void in my life with material possessions. However, what I failed to highlight at the time is the fact that I'm a total shop-a-holic.  For example, I own four copies of Suzanne Vega's album Solitude Standing on the original 12" vinyl. Why? Well, I inherited one of them. The other three? Well, each time I'm in a record shop and find this gem I tend to buy it, despite the knowledge that I already own it. I mean, it's usually only like $3.99 or something, how can I say no? Surely I'll come across pretty ladies in the future who will be unfamiliar with Tom's Diner and so I'll be a generous devil and give them each a copy. Of course, these pretty ladies will need a turntable. I am only romantically interested in women who own turntables however. And I like to think that any pretty lady I meet who has a turntable already owns Solitude Standing. And if they don't, well, I'll be frank: their prettiness gets demoted to kinda cuteness. And hell, the album isn't really all that great. Of course Tom's Diner is fantastic, and who doesn't love Luka? I even have time for a couple other songs. But as an album -- as a total  thing --  it stinks. No, I keep buying this album because the  idea  of Suzanne Vega is actually cooler than her music.  (Clearly I need my own radio show. Six people would listen, but these six people will be the coolest cats ever to enjoy FM.)  So I did K Records a favour tonight and bought quite a few CDs from them. How many? I don't want to talk about it.  Okay, I'm about to go somewhere else with this post. Let's get a new title going on.    Scream on: Part II      I owe someone a mix-cd. I've decided to make it the last mix-cd I ever make. The process, or I should say  my  process, is a long and arduous one. I end up listening to almost every single cd I own, getting frustrated, and eventually just slapping random songs on a disc that have no business being together. The don't-try try. If I actually attempt to make a great compilation, the amount of sweat and tears I put into it completely dwarfs any of the enjoyment obtained by the listener. They will never understand what these songs mean to me. And because of that "crime" of theirs I end up harbouring resentment. How could anyone not love something as much as I do? I refuse to recommend anything to anyone ever again. And after this mix is complete, no more forever. I'm keeping everything I love to myself. Nobody can hurt it there.
