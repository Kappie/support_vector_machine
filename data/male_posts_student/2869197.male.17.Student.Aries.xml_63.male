As some may know, I have a sickening and self-mutilating habit of picking at the pimple-scabs on my face. Some people sitting in front of me noticed and started whistpering and giggling. I felt something then. A deep sensation in my stomach, like someone replaced my lower intestinal tract with a bottomless pit of despair and endless black. It wasn't good.   Now, a normal person could care less about this feeling, but for me it is a sign of changes in my life. I've become more social and thus am more affected by society. Honestly, 3 years from now I wouldn't have cared what those people were giggling about. Heck, I probably wouldn't even notice that they existed. I don't like this change. I want to return to my world, my pitiful section of the universe were God and I breathe and think and exist without outside judgement. But I doubt I can anymore; society has spotted me and is hunting me like an eagle hunting a little mouse. My only hope is to return to my sense of uncaring: that their opinion not only means nothing but that they won't even be in my life two weeks from now. *Sigh* If only it were again.
