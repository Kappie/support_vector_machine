He was quite badly injured and unfortunately for the guy he is suing, was very near becoming a professional golfer.  They want my brother to go to court and give evidence saying that yes this man was good enough to be a pro golfer but since the accident wont be able to play any more.  The problem being though is that my brother plays golf like a cacti. so why do they want him? Because my brother shares his name with an ex pro golfer who now lives in gloucestershire.    Just to add another dimension of weirdness to this: my brother was also in a taxi, that crashed, in manchester.  There is also a film about a golfer with the same name (although not based on the real pro golfer).  So now there are 3 people with the same name:  two are golfers, the other is an embarrassment to the non golfing community  one is fiction, two are real,   one lives in gloucestershire, one spends half his time in gloucestershire and manchester and one lives in manchester  The non golfing slack-jawed idiot is being asked to testify about a golfer who was been in the same accident as he has, in the same vehicle, in manchester.    But if you knew pete, you would realise just how much things like this happen to him
