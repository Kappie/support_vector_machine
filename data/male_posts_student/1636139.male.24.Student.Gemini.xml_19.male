My former landlady Betty Ann introduced me to it  I now try to make it at least once every term. Usually, I use 3-4 squash  it lasts me about a week. 
  
The other event of note for today is that I finished reading  Sophie's World , which has taken me about 5 weeks of irregular reading to get through. What a book though! I'm exceedingly glad my sister cajoled me into reading it just before I left TO. I heartily recommend it to anybody with a casual interest in philosophy who also enjoys reading. 
I recently purchased a book called  Barbarians led by Bill Gates  from Amazon after reading a glowing appraisal of it on James Gosling's home page. I think I'll read that next.
