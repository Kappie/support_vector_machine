My good friend Kari (from PA, the one that comments on here on occasion) and her best friend Kendra, also a good friend, played a prank on me saying they weren't friends anymore and hated each other. It started on Wednesday when they actually had a legitimate small fight, but easily reconciled. Instead, they told me that they were not friends anymore, and where I found out was Kendra's online diary ( urlLink see it to read how she has been doing that her last two entries ). And then I asked them what happened. My only hint to that it was a prank was when I called Kendra and she told me that the fights were over "stuff" and couldn't give me specifics. However, they were so good at it, that I found out when they called me today (Kari's birthday party) and Kari told me to talk to one of her guests. The guest was Kendra, and she explained how the whole thing was a prank.   Now the dumb part... I feel so dumb, because I am the master at pranks, and nobody has ever been able to do something like that to me, because I always figure these things out. I am so proud of them though, because they put so much work into it, so much time spent making sure they aligned their stories just right so there were no holes in their stories, and so much more... including Kari even making fun of her on an e-mail, and saying that she is glad Kendra will no longer get in her way. I even thought that maybe it was all a hoax, but I dismissed that theory saying, "No, Kari and Kendra aren't that mean."  Well they are!  I tried some feeble attempts to get back at them while we were still on the phone, and they worked, but they're not nearly as good as what they did.  So no, Kari and Kendra, I'm not mad. In fact, I'm proud. But do it again, and face my wrath! AHHH! BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID!  Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
