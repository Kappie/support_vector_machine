I have been very remiss in writing blog entries, and not writing one for two weeks cannot be excused.  Today you shall hear about the tragedy of my papers.  History- 10th March 2004 - This was the first paper, and the one in which my panic attacks started. Though we hardly had much course, I was so freaked out that my productivity declined to approximately 20% of what it normally is. The paper did not, however, go badly and with a bit of luck I expect something like an 80 in it, which is extremely good for history.  2- Geography- 12th March 2004 - I am stupid, I left two whole chapters in this. Another effect of panic. In case someone has any tips on panic management, please give them to me, I ve managed to majorly screw up my papers this time, However, it could have been a lot worse. Am expecting about 80 in this too.  3- English- 13th March 2004 - What does one say about English? As apapers go, it wasn't bad, with the notemaing, the only thing I hate being easy, 75-80.  40 Maths-15th March 2004 - Now this was FUCKED! FAAKED MAJORLY. I don't know what happened but I forgot everything I had done in half my chapoters, and I'll be lucky if I manage a 60.  4th- Economics-17th March 2004 - The only redeeming feature of this was the fact that the Indian eco part was easy, sine I fucked up stats. Useless set of papers
