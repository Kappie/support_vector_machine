The instructor took the first few pages of a court brief and messed up the footnotes, and our assignment is to rewrite them correctly.  Fine.  Not a big deal.  On the bottom of the instructions page, he writes, "if you're interested in this topic, you can find the complete brief at [internet address]."  Uh, you mean the complete brief,  with all of the correct footnotes ???  Did he not realize that he was giving away the answers there?  I didn't look, because (a) the assignment is easy, and (b) come on, could someone really be desperate enough to cheat on this thing, worth 10% in a pass-fail class? and (c) I really feel bad for the professor because clearly he didn't intend to do this, and it wouldn't be right to take advantage of his carelessness.
