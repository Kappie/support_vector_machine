The Chinese "O" levels Oral examinations was looming closer and I had to prepare for it(mainly requiring it because of myself closing both eyes to the outside world). I couldnt sleep well the last night somehow and had to read myself to sleep, had 5hours of rest time in the end only.  Reached my tuition teacher's house late by 15 minutes at eight forty-five, and was made to settle down staring blankly at the headlines "TI GAO LAO REN DE FANG FAN YI SHI"(whatever that means). I struggled to swim through the words that kept reflecting in my mind as just being armies of  brave ants battling the ferocious tarantula that was feasting on them. It took me a while to regain consciousness of my surroundings when my teacher stirred me from watching the spectacular scene.   She then tested me on some of the topics in which my mind was wildly attempting the grasp at the concepts muddled up in my brains. Realising her futile efforts, my teacher starting ranting and raving over the proper behaviour and attitude I should have...then she brought up the horrendous topic that I had tried my best to avoid in the past few months- the failure at the last Chinese O levels, which deemed me unfit to remain in the Higher Chinese Stream, of which I had a cataclysmic showdown with my mother over the question on pride. My tutor mentioned a student, one of my contemporaries, of have grasped a lower standard of in Chinese, but yet still far surpassing me in the "O" levels examinations. It was because of his attitude, his sedulous aims at excelling the subject, his immaculate method of working, that caused him to overwhelm me. And I, on the other hand, was slacking away, having mindsets of belittling the subject, indolent in my every endeavours in preparing for the Chinese examinations,have had no interest in my work at all, and concentrating all my efforts on the one that had completely changed my mind and made me place my fate in its hands; The very paradigm of evil, destroying the lives of many people, turning them into advocates of their own destruction,unconsciously- The Computer.  Then I started reflecting, had my past attitudes been morally correct? The addiction, was it worthwhile? Is my future worth wasting over it? My tuition teacher said I was a bright boy, but it was because of this addiction that undermined my intellectual abilities and left me with nothing but the scraps of society, if I continue venturing towards this path of evil, it will only result in me being reduced to nothing but waste  material, no better than the piles of trash stacked up high in the landfills. No one would want me, love me, let alone keep me. I would only die in the flames of Hell if I were to continue my foolishness.  Somehow...I felt her efforts were just attempts to bamboozle me. Somehow, they were words of kindness, acts of benignity, ever so  loving, only felt from the love of my parents. Right now I do not  know what to do, I just feel ever so confused...should I change?
