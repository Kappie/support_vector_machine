I should hve gone much earlier so i wouldnt be feeling so sh*tty right now (not to mention my stupid headache). The other bad decision was actually deciding to wake up for school today. If i had known what was going to happen in school today i wouldnt hve bothered dragging myself out of my cool and comfortable bed. What happened in school today u ask? well basically NOTHING happened. No lessons, No new exam marks, and No teachers for crying out loud. I cant believe my chinese teacher actually didnt come to school, and my bm and sej teachers didnt even teach anythin today. I was so bored i actually ended up reading the latest issue of the Seventeen mag.. just goes to show how desperate i was. This was definitely NOT my ideal way of spending 6 hours of my life. About 10 people were smarter than me - they didnt turn up for school today! Why cant these people tell me when theyre going to miss school so i can make plans to spend more time with my bed..??  well looks like Greece is playing Portugal in the final on monday morning. I must say i thought Czech Republic would go through considering they were in better form throughout the tournament. But now i guess on paper it should be Portugal winning the final, although i hve a strong suspicion Greece might just pull off another giant-killing feat like what theyve been doing since the start of the competition...  Bets Anyone??   Turns out im going to see spiderman with my parents on sunday so it looks like i dont hve to drag any of my friends out after all. Ive heard from some that its actually quite boring, but hey thats probably the best show out now. Waiting in line behind Spiderman is King Arthur which is due out on the 15th i think. Starring in that show is none other than Keira Knightley!! This is gonna be one movie i dont want to miss....
