I mean, some of the people came to this meeting in business suits (for a package-handler job paying $8.50/hr.).  Of course, some people there also looked like they could hardly stand up, and I really wonder about all of this...I mean, if the economy is so bad that we have people applying for barely-minimum-wage jobs in business suits, what happens to the people at the lower end whose jobs they take?  This whole looking-for-a-job thing has also been quite the eye-opener.  I had it SO good back when I was working for Lianda and didn't have to worry about finding a job every summer!  But now...well, there isn't really anything available in the legal field (at least, that I've been able to find or that anyone has told me about), so it looks like I'm going to plan B:  manual labor.  But hey, this could be the perfect combo:  if I can work and get in shape at the same time, then do some interning with the Cleveland Public Defender, that would be the best of both worlds! (aside from the $8.50/hr., but I can manage...)  It's also opened my eyes to how hard it must be for people with "just" high school diplomas and whatnot to get jobs that actually pay anything. It was only partially a defense (and mostly the truth) when people at the DC Public Defender said that a lot of the people caught dealing drugs did so because it was the most feasible way for people down there to make money.  It was pretty much that or work at McDonald's or Starbucks or some place like that - and when it comes down to making $50 or $250 a night, I think the answer would be pretty obvious for most of us, too.
