I heard about these "blogs" a while ago, and after finding one on accident today (of a guy I've heard of), and I figured this would be a good way to express my thoughts and feelings to... just something. Maybe if I brush up on communication here, I'll get better with speaking in real life (yeah, right...). But I look forward to jotting my feelings down, so later in life, I can look back on what I had done.  That is all... and by all means, don't lose focus.
