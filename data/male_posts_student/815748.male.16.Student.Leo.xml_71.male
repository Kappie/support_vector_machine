I really have to get my head in the game, though, at least when it comes to class.  Judging by a few sources and some events that happened, I think I might actually have a shot, though. Nevertheless, it's going to be tough getting the dynamic ready by Thursday.  I've been shooting a little video for my movie.  It's going pretty well.  I came off as either smart or nerdy in math today.  I was explaining to Mr. Stanley (irreverently, as always) that he had put QED where he should have put QEF.  Most of the class had never heard of that.  But class itself was really relaxed and fun.  She wasn't there to witness my irreverence and intelligence, though.  Today in chemistry, we had a free, but we were supposed to be in the library (so we were).  I hung out at a table in one of those rooms with Ian, Matt Woolf, Melody, Melanie Joubanian, and Jing.  Ian and Woolfy mostly played on Ian's palm pilot; before we had listened to some music on it like that Leidenstadt song, to which I sang along.  Apart from a couple very short games of go, pretty much all I did was watch Mel, Mel, and Jing talk girl talk and look through a People Magazine.  Melody said that I shouldn't talk about her with other people, which was a little annoying because she talks about me with other people.  Oh well, I guess I won't hold it against her.  These days I've been talking about the Lor/Mel relationship almost half as much as I've been talking about my own designs.  The way I justify this without sounding stalkerish is that if I were the US, then it would be in my national interest to observe the foreign affairs of Britain and its girlfriend France.  Plus, it's good gossip.
