Don't worry, I'm not all that interested in taking over the world - well, I am, but in a nice, minimal-violence way (as opposed to slaughtering millions of people, cos all that really does is piss them off).  It's about time for the assignments to get handed out now - got one of them today, in fact, the one for my Web Programming module. The other one (for C Programming) I've seen, but hasn't officially been handed out yet (mainly because we haven't covered all the topics we need to yet). However, I've tackled bits of each, and they both seem pretty straightforward. Even to get Distinctions. A few of them will come in nicely!  For C, I have to produce a command-line program that outputs a 12-month calendar to the screen, 3 months across and 4 down. Already got the basic principles in there - I have code that outputs placeholders for the days, in 3 month blocks. All I have to do now is integrate the functionality of my earlier program, which only outputs the calendar in a single column. I reckon I'll have it done for next week :-)  The Web Programming one is a little more involved - produce an ordering system for a company selling Elvis memorabilia, of all things. Track stock levels, award free gifts, and produce an order confirmation page before squirting the completed order to a text file for processing. All using hidden form fields, we haven't (unfortunately) covered cookies - although I reckon hidden fields are more appropriate to this use in any case, so no reason to complain.  Also, we did a sample test for Networks and Communications the other day. 20 questions out of the real test's 50, about all we can reasonably expect to get right since we've only just started to cover the actual Networks side of the module. I got 17 out of 20 right - in other words, well on target for a Distinction grade there as well!  And as for the Visual Basic module :-P No problem. End test here we come (although not until the middle of January)!  So I guess I'm either a god, or at the very least a seriously smart guy :-P I know I probably don't compare to those people who know Java and stuff like the back of their hands, but I don't care :-P  Oh, and I love my girlfriend - Jade, if you read this, I LOVE YOU! She's practically a goddess, and I'm really really lucky to have someone so special in my life :-) Everyone should have someone like Jade in their life - but you can't have her, she's mine :-P  Ok, I suppose I should get on and do some more funky coding tricks now, so I'll end this here!
