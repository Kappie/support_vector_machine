Stupid Cartoon Network's [adult swim] got me hooked on it.  The first season is really great... there's a lot of weirdness that goes on in the storyline and most of it is interconnected to make you want to try to figure out what's going on in the whole scheme of things.  Quick breakdown: Takes place in a city called "Paradigm City".  The city of amnesia.  Approximately 40 years ago something happened to make everyone lose their memories.  No one knows what happened.  Bits and pieces surface every once in a while to give them glimpses of their past.  Fortunately people remembered how to use electricity and machines and that sort.  ANYway, check it out, it's fun.
