Not that I really plan on changing this (it DOES make them speed up and/or get out of the way most of the time), but it was a good observation.  Now I just have to hope that my insurance agent never stumbles upon this blog... (but I'VE NEVER GOTTEN IN AN ACCIDENT...at least, not one that had any reports filed and/or caused any "serious" damage to anything except my wallet).
