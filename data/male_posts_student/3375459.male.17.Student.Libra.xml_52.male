I’m not going to tell you. =p  In school, we were brief on what to take note of at the site. The brief ended in less then an hour, and so we the brothers moved on to the site (old warehouses beside the gallery hotel) without waiting for our tutors and classmates. Even so, we have to stop at Sumerset station for the tutors to lead the way. Let’s see, we jaywalked to the Singtel building right outside the left exit of the station. Then we passed by the “Mistress Block” (where man’s kept their mistress as told by our tutors). Pass by River Valley Primary School before reaching out site. Boy was it a ‘Short Walk’. I fell like a blur cok over there and I dun even know where to start off. Should have read the brief earlier and planned ahead, LAZY ME. My group dispersed leaving me scrolling around there, well at least I did 1 sketch of the Robertson Bridge.  I wonder how Tanjie is doing, her reply seems so lifeless. Anyway, the brothers except for Lester gather and had a little “Childish Period” before we head on down to Cineleisure B.K. for lunch.
