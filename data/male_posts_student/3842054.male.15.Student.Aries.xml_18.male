I was there today on the order of my moms buisness, so my brothers and I  went to Cityplace while my mother was in a meeting at Dreyfoos. We got lunch at Cityplace, and then we got Gelato at Bacio. Then we went to barnes and noble, restoration hardware, then the taj mahol of all schools. I guess their little trip inspired them to want to try out there no matter what. THey were even picking their spots where they are going to eat lunch when they go there.   So we go home, and i go to katies. Yeah. Then i went to the mall with Andrew (My brother www.chuckie9225.blogspot.com ) and his friend christian. Yea. I bought the sugarcult CD from hollister and i had mcdonalds for dinner. I ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING TODAY... even if it isnt interesting.  Tommorow, I go to the mall wiht Brittney and Becca, who i havent seen in MONTHS. Yea. I would write something deep and thought provoking.... but im too tired. Cya.
