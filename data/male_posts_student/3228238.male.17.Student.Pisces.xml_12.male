     
      Happy those who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, nor go the way of sinners, nor sit in company with scoffers.  Rather, the law of the Lord is their joy; God's law they study day and night.  They are like a tree planted near streams of water, that yields its fruit in season; its leaves never wither; whatever they do prospers.  But not the wicked!  They are like chaff driven by the wind.  Therefore the wicked will not survive judgement, nor will sinners in the assembly of the just.  The Lord watches over the way of the just, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin.  Psalm 1
