I like her, smart gal she is. Works at the teen crisis centre, I believe.  Anyhoo, so here I am, sitting there sober, and everybody is trying to get me wasted. THANKS MOM!  Then my aunt pushed my cousin into the kiddie pool, and she dragged her in with her...Lotsa things I seen that I wish I did not see....*shivers*  But yeah, drunk people are a lot of fun to watch. But never do as they do...No.   There's that reverse serendipity again. I could have went and seen a great movie with my friends, but instead I went and watched a bunch of adults get drunk.  I live a charmed life, I do.  Not to worry, I'll get to see it on sunday with my uncle...hopefully.   I still don't really even know why I'm so freakin pissed off. I guess I'm just looking for reasons. Fuck matt, you're such a dick sometimes.
