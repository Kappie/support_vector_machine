I was sliding through alternate universes every couple minutes with Amy and Amar and possibly Jordan *Sturm, although I have a feeling he might have just showed up every universe as a different person.  I only saw myself in one universe, and I was flamboyantly gay.  Other universes included what looked like Ameteria from Mystt exile and a giant pizza hut. Either later in that dream or in another one entirely, I was with a group of people and I had somehow obtained a pet fox, but it just acted like a dog.  I was with Ashley and she had the tiniest cat I'd ever seen, and it kept attacking my fox.  My fox was really smart but not always obedient.  And I was sleeping in a large loft room on a tiny little bed.  And I had a cell phone with text-drawing porn on it, although it was utterly pointless and hard to identify.  Now I'm remembering something else, possibly unrelated.  Jonah playing a gameboy game trying to 'unlock' a musical.  Well, I'll update as details fill in.
