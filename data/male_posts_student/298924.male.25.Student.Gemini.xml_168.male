My earliest memory of my boy Eulus was going over his house for a sleepover (I know that's not the term reserved for little boys but "overnight party" sounds hokey)....anyway, we played footbal in his yard for a while and then watched movies....Karate Kid was the feature that night....  I remember that Eulus was in my second grade class, but he got into the Fulton County Majority to Minority program and transferred to Heards Ferry....  Well somehow or another we ended up ALWAYS over one another's houses....spending whole weekends....we would start off just going over to play some video games....or going to some movie....then somehow the whole weekend would be gone....and it would be time to go to school the next day....sometimes I left straight from his house to go to school....we were both the smartest people we knew....we would debate and debates would turn into arguments....we would fight all the time....we would also play contra and bionic commando and tecmo bowl....he was my best friend....  We started middle school and I was at Camp Creek and he was at the middle school de jour for Fulton County, Ridgeview....at that time my friend Nile was also one of my best friends and I remember a moment that played out like a bad 80's sitcom....you know when a person has 2 best friends and they meet and fight each other....well that happened with me....Nile was outspoken....and Eulus was no punk.....so they used to disagree all of the time....they probably don't remember that....anyway I had a Super Bowl party in 7th grade and those two of course were beefing....and it turned somehow into me and Eulus beefing....I don't remember much else about those times but I know we were going in different directions for a while....  High School started and once again we were at different schools....it's funny because when I was in middle school all I could talk about was going to Mays High and I ended up at Westlake....well Eulus went to Mays....if you know anything about Atlanta, you know that as far as elite black high schools go, there is Mays, and maybe Douglass (I hope the Drewski doesn't read this) and then everyone else....Well we each did our things at our respective places....both of us doing fairly well, towards the end of our high school journeys we started to kick it more....he had a car so he was able to get around....  Anyways one day we were discussing college on the phone....I was on the fast track to Xavier, and I had also just visited Howard University, which I liked alot....he was headed to Tuskegee to be a Vet....he always loved dogs....both of our fathers had gone to Morehouse.....but for some reason we never really thought much about doing it....we had gotten the same SAT score (I believe)....and briefly we discussed the fact that both of us had recieved full scholarship offers to Morehouse....so somehow it ended up that by the time it was all said and done we both not only ended up at Morehouse, but also both started summer programs on the same day....  Freshman year he stayed in Graves Hall, which is the honors dorm at Morehouse....I stayed in Dubois with my boy Nile (who also ended up at Morehouse through happenstance)....we went on a road trip to Howard for their homecoming (they crushed Morehouse 55-3 or something...but we didn't even go to the game)....we also hit up a med school tour with the Health Careers club that took us BACK up to D.C.....as the year progressed we kicked it more and more....we decided to room together Sophomore year....  Sophomore year could be a whole post by itself....some of the highlights were homecoming, the Holyfield fight/the night our room flooded, the yelling across the way at Will and Phil, the adventures with Seante`, the many drinking sessions at B.J. and Fza's, the time I went to Miami and missed the wildest Eulus related Morehouse moments, and on and on....we had alot of fun....and I know I was a bad roommate, but he put up with me better than anyone else has....  Junior year he went to Stanford for Spring semester and that was rough for me....in alot of ways I kind of "found myself" during that time, but it was odd without my best friend....the nigga that knew me best and could probably help me see my way through alot of the stuff that was going on....senior year, we kicked it more than the law should have allowed....we had some rough patches in there, but it's all been worthwhile  As we have grown into adults Eulus has always been one of two people that I KNOW without a doubt I can count on for ANYTHING....when my pops was sick he was the first person there for me, as a matter of fact I was at his house when I got the phone call about my dad....I know I can count on getting a call from Eulus once a week....his family is my family and my family is his family....he is the brother I never had.....  Well my nigga Eulus is turning 23 today....he is persuing an advanced degree at University of Maryland-College Park (go for the Ph.D nigga!!!)....that's my nigga for life and I wish I could be up there celebrating with him....do the damn thing homie!!....don't party too hard!
