X) This year, however, I put some effort into a present. A few months (perhaps weeks) ago, Zefer linked me to a site where you can type in your address and get a nice aerial image of your house taken by a satellite. The images are black and white and kinda hard to make out, but since our house has that massive garden in back, it's pretty easily distinguishable. Anyways, I took that image of our house/garden and added in the name of my dad's farm business and the year it was established in MS Paint. Then I got a nice frame to put it in at Wal-Mart. I think it turned out to be a pretty snazzy Father's Day present. He seemed to like it.  After that, my sister and I played badminton for a while. And then we went to Subway for supper. Mmm... subs.
