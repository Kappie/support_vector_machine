Now this guy seriously needs to be slapped, and I mean slapped damn hard. First thing I noticed right from the start is that this guy never said men or women, he keeps saying boys and girls which leads me to believe that this 30 year old probably is still stuck in the preteen "girls have cooties" stage of his life and he probably still lives in his moms basement. Next thing I noticed was his star trek analogy, nothing screams DORKWAD like the ability to make an actually analogy to star trek that is understandable to other trekkies. But I'm too tired now to fully insult this idiot but I suggest you read the article and make you're own decision on how stupid this guy is. -Matt
