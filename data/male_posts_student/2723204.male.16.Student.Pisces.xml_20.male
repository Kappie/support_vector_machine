Deafening is the silence, amidst thoughts so chaotic, Why can't I play on? For a note, did I play wrong?  Inspiration leaves, leaving me cold. And thoughts about her, where did it all stem from? Her voice I hark, but none could I hear  My piece is she willing to listen, my song, she wishes to hear. But why can't I play it in front of someone I hold so dear? Fatigue overwhelms me, as she listens impatientily. For I have waited for her to come, waiting all night For i know only after my piece you've heard, will I ever sleep so tight.  I wonder when will she return. Musty and lonely is the room as the door she closes. Please forgive me for this piece gone awry. For your return will I await, and a better piece will I play, that's my promise. My emotions would it reflect, your heart would it touch.  But please do not leave me alone............... For your guidance do I need, your help do I seek. Please teach me how to play this piece, this piece of Love. Please come in again, to show me how..........  Please...........
