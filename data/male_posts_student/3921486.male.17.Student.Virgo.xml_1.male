I make it more complicated that it is. I wont stop thinking about it.  Yeah i should just relax and not worry about anything and my hair will probably be healthy.  If not i'll have an old man hair. So from now on I won't try to mourn about that pass or worry about the future.I know I say it a lot but I don't really follow it.  So am going to stay in the present and the present only.
