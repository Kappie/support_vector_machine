Too many websites to design. Too many forums to check every day. Not enough damn time! Or maybe I have the time, but don't use it well - that's what I'm starting to think. The trouble with me is that once I get stuck into something, I lose track of the time and the hours fly by. I really should manage my time better.  That's enough use of the word 'time' for today, thanks. On a different note, it's finally the weekend! Horray! Things to do over the two days? 1) work 2) finish the review I'm working on 3) do some work on my Computing coursework 4) do some homework for a change 5) install driving test program 6) phone Sony up and have a go at them for being outstandingly lazy 7) cancel my PS2 magazine subsciption and get a decent one. Well, that's the theory anyway! I know I'll probably waste saturday by waking up at 10:30 and then spending the rest of the day at work.   I must manage my time better I must manage my time better I must manage my time better I must manage my time better I must manage my time better
