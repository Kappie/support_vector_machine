There aren't many of my friends from school left there. Its not a town that tends to retain people once they leave school. The majority seem to go off to university, and never return. My best friend Nick is still there though, even though he has left a couple of times, he comes back.  It was nice to see my parents, I don't spend nearly as much time visiting them as I should. It was also good to catch up with Nick.  At the moment I'm thinking about what I will do when I finish Teacher's College. I've been thinking recently that I will probably move out of Auckland. I've been here for almost ten years, and thought it was only going to be temporary. I first came here when I joined the RNZAF, and then after I left there I just stayed, got married, and just never left. Now I'm thinking that perhaps its time for a new start, a new location. I'm not sure where I would want to go, but the Waikato is definitely an option. But would I ever go back to my hometown? I don't think so. To me it would feel like a step backwards, like admitting I couldn't make it outside, and I was retreating. Anyway, I have a couple of years to think about it.
