When I woke up this morning I sort of realized something. Summer's almost over and I did almost everything I wanted to do. I think the only thing is that there are certain people I wish I hung out with more than I actually did.  I've been told that I'm pretty good a keeping in touch with people. I suppose I am, but there are certain people which I think fall through the cracks. This could be in large part due to the person on the other end not wanting to keep in touch. That's cool if they don't want to, but sometimes I wonder if it's cause they read my intentions wrong?  I still have about 7 pages... 5 if I make it 12.5 font... to do. I don't feel motivated.  Indie bands playing today... I wonder if there will be as many punks, midgets, goths, pregant chicks wearing bikinis, guys with roses attached to their nipples, etc.  **  **
