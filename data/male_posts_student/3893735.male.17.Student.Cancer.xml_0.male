But every single teenager in the world does, so I cant complain about this, coz my situation isn't bad.  GIRL troubles- Every 17 year old guy knows what I'm talking about! You chicks are crazy! Feelings changing more often than a baby's nappy... I still love you, but not as a GF! Hoping that you realise how much you mean to me as a friends some day soon, then maybe we can spend time together.  FRIEND troubles- Now this is messed up! Wouldnt you think that the boys you hang out with for 3 years are ya best mates! Well obviously not, as I'v found out recently! Teenage guys can be worse than chicks, they love backstabbing each other, the problem is when you start to do it to you're own group of friends.  DEATH issues- I really dont wanna accept this whole death thing, everybody dies... but this is my greatest fear in life! Losing the people that i care for the most, its like all of you'r love has gone to waste or somthing... Once i can accept this I will be there for my friend who needs me.  SCHOOL problems- School has to be the most boring place on earth! Everyday i go there do my lessons, then at recess and lunch times i just walk around from group to group talkin to random people, some ppl who i really like i avoid, I cant hack that either.  MAKING the RIGHT decision- Thers another problem i'm gonna be facing soon, thats what to do when i leave school, which i really wanna drop out of! I need to decide where i want my life to go, I love art... But im lazy, to be successful in the art world it takes motivation.  {A CONFLICT INSIDE ME} Thers all of these emotions inside me at the moment, anger, love, hate, lust ect... Its pretty hard for me to act happy while i dont know how i'm feeling, its so strange... theres only one person that makes me truely happy, but there alot of great friends that can cheer me up... I guess I'v been down these holidays because I dont have a GF and my mates seem to be busy every day.  BORED AS A MF!!! Need a CHANGE of scenery. well not as a mf, coz at least then i'd be doin somthing lol... All this time alone, makes me think about times that were better, places i wish i could go back to, ppl i wish i could be with again, i wanna go back to europe live there for like a couple of years. Anyone wanna come with me??? It'l be mad fun.
