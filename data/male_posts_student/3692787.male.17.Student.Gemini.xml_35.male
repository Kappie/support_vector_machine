Diba yan yung sinulat ni Alden? ;) ------------------------------ I love the smell of tyranny in the morning...  My plan for world domination has begun to unfold. Don't blink, 'cause you might just find a long wire sprouting from the ceiling connected to your cerebellum when you choose to open your eyes. You will be hooked to what is known as "the collective," where all thought patterns are monitored such that, in the event that we find certain rebellious emotions beginning to well up in you, we will be duly notified and you will be subdued.  But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's take it from the top.  First off, I've already mentioned  urlLink my vice grip on technology and how I intend to cause panic and chaos the world over.  Next, I've given you  urlLink a taste of my elite global domination training program.  Then, I gave you  urlLink a hint of my immensely powerful telepathic and telekinetic powers.  Lastly, I've been ridiculed my entire life because of my name, so what better way to make people respect it (and me, ultimately) than to  force them to respect it?   In traditional evil villain fashion, I shall reveal to thee mine plan so far. And yes, you are dangling over a shark tank on a rope with a giant laser beam aimed at your forehead right now, though you're likely to escape... BUT THAT WON'T STOP ME FROM REVEALING MY PLAN ANYWAY!!! AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!  The foundations of my plan is not to be found in previous entries. It revolves not on contaminated diskettes, mandatory rap anthems or my evil powers. Rather, it revolves on a much more massive and powerful force, a pseudo-realistic matrix that has captured the hearts, minds and souls of the populace. It is a body much more evil than I, causing many to spend countless hours as mindless drones desperately searching for some form of indirect contact with other organic life-forms. It is a force that I like to call...    Fear this, bitches!  Yes, friendster. While you are certain to question my sanity, think about "the math" for a bit. I can have up to 500 friends, right? Suppose I found a way to turn those 500 friends into loyal minions, say, by posting a Bulletin saying "if u dont swear ur undying loyalty 2 me ur acount wil b deleted..." Bam! 500 minions just like that! Too small a number? Then add, "...pass dis on 2 all ur friends or ur account wil b deleted," to said message. Suppose all my friends have 500 friends themselves. That means each of my friends will have 500 minions, and my minions' minions are therefore MY minions! Check the digits: 500 x 500 = 250,000! A quarter of a million! Doing the same to my third degree friends, 500 each as well, turning them into my minions' minions' minions, and everyone in my personal network would have sworn their undying loyalty to me! Don't think that could lead to a lot? Blow your mind on this: 250,000 x 500 = 125,000,000. That's 125 million evil minions all grovelling at my feet! Well, give or take a couple hundred thousand, considering multiple accounts, common friends, etc.  Granted, that falls a little short of America's 293.9 million and way short of China's 1.27 billion, which means my military strength might be lacking, in numbers at least, should these countries somehow get all their citizens to oppose your campaign. Ah, but fear not! Take solace in the fact that I am not alone! There are plenty of other people who want to rule the world! I shall make friends with these people and form alliances (just like on Survivor!).  How many friends do I need to make? 51. No more, no less. Why? Well, if each person does the same thing on friendster as I did, then: 51 x 125,000,000 = 6,375,000,000! That means we 51 hopeful overlords will control 99.84% of the world's population! And how, pray tell, am I to get them to follow me?  By fear!  I will threaten them using my aforementioned contaminated diskettes, since most aspiring overlords rely heavily on computers and the Internet.  All I need now is some sort of hierarchal scheme to keep things in check. I have to make sure that they know I'M the one calling the shots, since this was, of course, my idea. I shall hereby appoint myself as the godfather of the Domination Preparatory Society (DPS for short). My next ten tyrants will be the "founding fathers," who will handle the trivial tasks that I needn't waste energy on. Ten more will be in charge of surveillance and espionage, making sure no one is getting any "ideas" on stopping DPS. Twenty-five of the other tyrants will be normal members, but they can upgrade to "Area Boss" level by paying a small fee, which will change nothing really, it's just that they might prefer that title over "member." Five more of the tyrants, hand-picked by yours truly, will be the  alalays . They're the ones who take care of all the dirty work. Should we be discovered in any way, one of these people will be used as the scapegoat. Basically, if this were a video game, we have five lives and that's it, Game Over. Oh, and one of those five will be my right-hand man, who will be uber-loyal and stuff like that.  And with that, I take over the world by force. Honestly, what's 10 million strong  compared to 6.375 billion strong?  Then again, I might end up with all the panisies who don't know how to hold a gun and stuff. Oh well. If all else fails I can always rely on my immensely powerful telekinetic abilities. Even if someone manages to stop me, I can at least raise some hell before they do. ------------------------------ completely wrong thought of the day: I have a question. You know that show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"? My sister and I suspect Thom Filicia is a Filipino. More than the fact that he looks Filipino, his name is so pinoy too. t-H-o-m *emphasis on H* But still, Filicia sounds kiinda pinoy too. Whaddaya think? (obviously, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, never mind then)
