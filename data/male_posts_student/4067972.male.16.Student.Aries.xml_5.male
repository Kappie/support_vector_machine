This one was a repo that was reposessed about a year ago, and she was taking us over there to see if there was anything we could use or sell at the rummage sale we're having this weekend.  So, we went over there and looked around.  I found some percussion stuff that seemed nice, but what do i know.  So i'm gonna take it to Mr. A sometime and see what he thinks.  My brother found something a little different.  He tripped over a box and a plastic penis jumped out and attacked him.  I laughed hard at him...no pun intended...heh.  It seems to me that that's not something you would leave behind for someone to find, but ya know.  We didn't go back into that room.  Who knows what else is in there.
