Oh yeah, besides playing that infernal Lineage 2 beta that I got into, I think I am going to make a web site for TKD.  That, and Microbiology is pretty cool, but my group sucks cause they are all dumb.  I mean, shaking the inoculation loop to cool it after sterilizing?  Good idea... If you're dumb.  Anyways, I should go do something productive.  Like sleep.  Sleeping is good.  Healing is good.  My body is still feeling weird, but I am very loose still.  Cool.    I wonder what Sammy is up to...  I hope Utah is fun.  Oh yeah.  I think that if people are going to spend 10 bucks to go watch Jesus be tortured and killed, then we need to see the bodies of those people who were killed today.  I wanna see the hanging bodies.  Call me sick, but if you want to get affected by something, then you need to see it.  No shelter here.  This is the thanks we get from a people who supposedly are grateful.  Sound grateful to you?  In the words of Mohammed (other crazy instructor who is originally from Iran) "These people are like, yay, Americans!  Thank you!  NOW FUCK OFF!"  Meddlers.  That's all we are.  Now our innocents are dying, too.  But should we care when we kill theirs?
