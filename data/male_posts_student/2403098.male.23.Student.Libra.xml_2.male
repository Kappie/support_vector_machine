ANYwho, I'm down at the coast visiting the family for Thanksgiving, feeling quite the fatass at the moment, I love to eat, I wish I didn't.  When I get back to Norman, it's definitely 'go-time' with the whole working out thing.  Note to self:  price personal trainers to see what the going rates are.  So I copied Lauren, she started an on-line journal, why shant I?  I don't know, seems fun.  Hers was nice, mentioned nice things about me, us getting back together as friends in whatever context that might evolve.  OOH thanksgiving = thankful shit.. So what am I thankful for?  I'm thankful for friends, I'm thankful for my family who is quirky, but always there for me.  I'm thankful for my dog, Boomer, because I think that he's a special little creature.  I'm thankful for all the opportunities that I've been granted, and for no good reason either.  I did nothing to deserve probably 99.79% of what I have, and for that I'm truly appreciative.  I'm thankful for the opportunity to have attended college, and the support to get a higher degree should I desire.  I'm thankful for my car, even though it sounds weird right now, I'm so glad I at least have something when so many people have to walk.  Okay, so really I don't know ANYONE who walks around or literally "RUNS" errands, but still, I'm thankful for it NONEtheless.  I'm thankful for so many things, that I'll just have to cut a lot of them short, much like a rambling acceptance speech at an awards show.  *Pointing my award up to heaven*.  Thanks to the fans, etc.    So I am glad that Lauren contacted me.  I never like discord between people, but it's so difficult sometimes to know what to do when you feel hurt in a situation.  It constantly amazes me just how powerful human emotions are, and words as well.  I could say things, and know that they are merely a compilation of words grouped into sentences, and change people's entire lives.  So strange, so scary, so... so... whatever Jesse Spano.  Aiite, I'm gonna stop this now.  I could write for probably 10 hours because I'm WIDE awake after my post-thanksgiving nap, yet my entire family is asleep.  I'm bored... not much to do out on the town in Rockport, Texas on a holiday.  Hell, if it was any given Saturday there still woudlnt be much to do.  I could go get drunk at a local dive with Vietnamese shrip-boat captains, or find myself chillin' with some locals, but I doubt that'd be more fun than sitting in my pajama pants and drinking alone.  As I always say- NEVER drink by yourself... (unless you're alone).  Peace out, God Bless the USA, and all that jazz.
