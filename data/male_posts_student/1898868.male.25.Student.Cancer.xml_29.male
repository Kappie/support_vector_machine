CHARACTER A: "Main character;" teacher on summer break, 25-ish, guy, his big conflict is that he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life - he likes teaching but isn't sure if it's what he wants to do; in a loungy/rock cover band with B  CHARACTER B: Friend of A, unemployed, looking to make some money however he can, old friend of C; in band with A  CHARACTER C: From a wealthy family (his dad is an alderman in Chicago), has no job besides a silly job coaching a high school girls club lacrosse team, old friend of B, is has a gambling problem, needs money to pay back a debt, engaged to G  CHARACTER G: the girl, engaged to C  SEMI-PLOT OUTLINE:  -Starts out on the final days of school... One of A's friends at school, another, older teacher has connections to a big street festival that is going on in Chicago at the end of the summer and he gets A's band to be featured at it... says he's looking forward to it...  -Characters A  B go to a party because C has recently called B saying he has a job for him... at the party, C tells B he wants him to steal his fiance's engagement ring (G's), and he tells him how to do it (how to break into G's apartment and get it... Meanwhile, A  G, who don't know each other or who the other is, are hitting it off in an other room at the party.  A gives G his phone number.  A  B leave.  -Next night, A  B break into G's apartment and steal the ring so that C can collect on the insurance money (he has a gambling debt).  They then drop the ring off to C as directed... C pays them $500... Meanwhile, A realized that it's the apartment of the girl from the party yesterday!  -G wakes up and notices the ring is gone.  She is trying to figure out where it could be... calls A to ask if he noticed it on her finger the other day at the party (because he gave her his phone number)... A, who likes her, suggests they don't talk about it now but meet later for a drink or lunch to talk about it...  -C ends up seeing them out at lunch together.  He doesn't know that A was B's partner, and A can't say anything in front of G.  So C gets all upset, and threatens to screw over A.  He says his dad is an alderman, and A just laughs, figuring "what can an alderman do?"  -Next day, A wakes up and his car is being towed.  He runs out there with B, and they watch as it's getting taken away.  Meanwhile, some of A's students from the high school (on summer break now) drive by in a convertible and say something insulting.  A doesn't really pay attention to them, but B gets all upset and writes down the license plate number, saying he'll get them back.  -Character B, unbeknownst to A, later goes and intimdates the high school kid, and tells him to mow A's lawn.  He keeps intimidating the kid and say "that's what you get for laughing at the misfortune of others" (ridiculous thing for him to yell at him for)  -Next day A wakes up and hears someone mowing his lawn.  It's the kid from the convertible.  A tells him to go home.  -Next day A's principal calls and tells him to come in.  The parents of the kid have complained... Principal tells A that he's on thin ice as far as being allowed to return next year. This pisses off A and makes him even more confused as far as whether he wants to return...  -Thus, we introduce a private investigator from the Chicago Public Schools, whose job it is to find teachers who are not actually living within the city limits of Chicago and report them.  The P.I. has been told by the principal to watch A, because he's looking for an excuse to fire him.  -A's car is gone, and so he needs to take cabs to get around... two or three terrible cab situations could occur (a la Joe Shafer's experiences): (1) the cabby doesn't have change to give to A and so he keeps him hostage in a cab while he drives around and tries to get change, and (2) A is attacked from behind as he walks from the car by a cabby (who made a bunch of wrong turns) and is unhappy with his tip.  -These cab situations scare A out of taking more cabs... eventually he just asks the P.I., who follows him everywhere, if he can just get a ride from him (b/c he's still following him anyways)  -A, B, and a few of their friends are every once in a while playing in their band at a bar.  They have a rival rock band who takes themselves very seriously and gets most of the major shows/bars.  This rival band has a leader who is extremely upset that A's band has been given the street festival show, which the rival band was counting on getting.  -In the meantime, on his way home from a bar late at night, A is suddenly "kidnapped" by a bunch of tough guys in a car.  They tell him that they know he's "friends with C because they've seen him talking to him" (the day C found A at lunch with G), and that C owes them money.  Because they're friends, if C doesn't pay then they will hold A responsible as well.  A tries to tell them that he's NOT friends with C, but they don't listen.  They just drop him off on the side of the road and pull away.  -A is totally confused and doesn't know what's going on.  For information, he goes to the P.I. and tells him he'll give the name of a teacher at his school that doesn't live in Chicago if the P.I. will do some investigating for him.  The guy agrees, and when A gives him a name, the P.I. finds out about the tough guys in the car... He finds out that C has a gambling problem, and that he once borrowed money from a guy at a casino. He lost the money and was unable to pay the guy back.  This is one of the reasons that C is trying to scramble for money and had B steal the engagement ring back so he could get the insurance money.  Nevertheless, C still owes big money.  -C's dad, the alderman, wants his son to prove himself, and so he puts his son in charge of the big street festival coming up.  -----------------------------------------  Something big will go down at the street festival.  I'm not sure what, yet, but it will be good.  C needs to make a whole bunch of money, so i think he should be planning something that will make him money but still make him look respectable in front of his dad.  Maybe he will have the festival be robbed or something.  I don't know yet.  But the festival will be a big thing that brings a lot of the pieces of the movie together - G will be there (who C has been trying to "bump into" as much as possible, at the gym, the supermarket, etc), the rival band will be there (who have been threating A's band and A), the casino guys will be there, maybe any other characters), maybe even the high school girls that play on C's lacrosse team (which he may use in his scheme)  -----------------------------------------  The movie will end with things being somewhat resolved between the characters.  Nevertheless, A has become disillusioned with Chicago and has made up his mind to move away (maybe to the pacific northwest).  Thus, his "need" throughout the movie is resolved.  He has decided that he will continue to teach, because he likes it, but that he no longer wants to live in Chicago.    The clincher will be that as he is driving away, he goes to stops to say goodbye to G.  He doesn't realize it, but she slips something in a card to him.  He opens it up, as she requests, when he is outside of Chicago.  It contains the engagement ring (which she has somehow found out about, and taken from C and now given to A).  It is totally off anyone's record, because it has already been reported stolen, and so he can do whatever he wants with it.  Assuming it is worth a lot of money, it will be good starter money for him wherever he goes...  ----------------------------------------  Well, that is the idea we came up with.  I'm pretty sure I left some small parts and characters out, but for the most part I got it all in.  What do you think?  It's a little bit of a different style than the last idea - I think it would be a comedy, but more because the characters and situations are ridiculous, not as slapsticky as I think the Jackass-type movie may be...  Let me know if you like it!
