I do not think the world of myself, however much it may look it, and I certainly don't think I know everything. I will admit that I tend to have a hard time accepting different opinions than my own, but hey, this is my blog ;) Anyhow, I plan to post my personal opinions on everything from politics to anime's, and if I happen to get any reader's than more power to me! Hope to talk to you soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sincerely,                                                                                                                                                     Jeff Graham
