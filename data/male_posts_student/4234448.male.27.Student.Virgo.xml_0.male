Among the mothers and fathers of the children, heated discussions took place.  It was agreed that danger still existed.  A change in kings would not change the plight of king’s subjects.  The Empire and its kingdoms had always outlived its individual rulers.  Egypt, however, was not there home.  If their children were to one day strike at the foundations of the Empire, fear served only to lock them out of their homeland and its promise.  For years their people had lived under the threat of violence.  Nothing would change if they never returned.  Their journey home would be a gamble based upon a hope.  It would be an act of faith.  Not long after their return, the people of Nazareth gathered to dedicate themselves to the upbringing of the children.  Together they pledged to nurture the children with tenderness and warmth, to model the generosity of sharing, to reveal the beauty of creation, to demonstrate the meaning of care for others, to spur their imaginations with stories, to humor them with play, to equip them with the history of their people, to strengthen them with the customs that enabled survival and resistance.   The children became the joy of the people.  They grew and became strong, filled with wisdom.  The presence of God was in them.
