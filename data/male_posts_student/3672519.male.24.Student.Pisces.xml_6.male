My parents immediately dumped twenty fledglingkoi in, and realised that they spent most of the time huddled in a corner at the floor. The useless creatures.  After several trips to afish farm in pasir ris and a row of specialty aquariums in serangoon north,I came back withfifteen archer fish,five mud suckers, a pearl arowana and a silver arowana, two gar pikes, and what is known in chinese as a "white nine-fin dragon".  I realised that with every purchase the inhabitants were becoming increasingly carnivorous,and really, there's no escaping the past. I've spent the last ten years keeping almost every conceivable breed of freshwater carnivore available illegally in Singapore, short of crocodiles and pirahnas. Already, delirious dreams of clever pondpartitioning are brewing in my head for an alligator snapping turtle, an indonesian fire-peacock snake-head, some Thailand leaf tigers and not to mentionour decade-long family talisman of fortitude,the very alive and insatiable long-neck turtle who is now impossible to carry because he will stretch around and bite your fingers off.
