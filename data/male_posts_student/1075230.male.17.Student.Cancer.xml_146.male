I did a bunch of tests in the morning (I think I did more tests in a single week, then the previous months combined). Also, started working on units a bit. However, there were still some stretches when I slacked off a bit...    One of the key events during this time was the Focus Wonderland Trip, this was a rather fun event, as I have never been - unlike the rest of the people here *looks around* My first time riding a roller-coaster was... um.. not as exciting as I thought it would be. It was definitely an experience I won't forget, and definitely something I've never experienced before... but I don't get why people would be afraid or go pukey just cause of roller-coasters! ^^;; (no offense to those that do). It was a really fun day...   For the last 2 weeks of school, for like 5 days, I slept at 4 am, and the rest I slept at 12am. I recall pulling off 5 tests in a single day, and 11 tests in the last week. On the final night, I pulled off 4 units ^^;;    It didn't help that I lost my agenda during that last week (as if losing my science and math textbooks over the year wasn't enough). Also the line-up at the test centre was interesting... I've heard of it, now I got to experience it ^^;; really, there wasn't any need for the line-up. Everyone rushed to take tests in the morning, while period 3 and onwards, it was like empty.    What did I learn from all this? One can finish 80 units and like 25 tests in two months. One can work if one is motivated to. Never take breaks - you  think  you need one... but you really don't. The best thing is to keep working while you can. Taking a break will cause you to lose your pace. Start working at the beginning of the school year... immediately.    Ah yes, it was around this time that Saturday School ended too.. it was fun this year, like every other year. Got to meet up with some people ^^;; Actually met Aaron at Sat School before normal school... and to think that this was a person that was at my old school for 4 years of my life... and that I never talked to him then, lol... same goes for Dickson. I guess there was this kinda barrier between immersion and non-immersion people...   ~Chronos
