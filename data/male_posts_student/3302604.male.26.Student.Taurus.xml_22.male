Not a bad little showing if I do say so myself, I had that unusual feeling of looking at the question, not really knowing what I was supposed to do, but as I worked through it, the whole thing slowly unfolded in my head. I think i probably did better than I thought I would as I managed to quote the mathematical proofs verbatim, with all the fiddly tedchnical guff that normal people manage to forget. So here's hoping.  All this, of course will become academic (har har) by this afternoon as we have some kind of weird Physics typew module exam today. Yeah, in a maths course, but trust me, that's the most normal part of this course. Fortunately, all of the people I have spoken to have as little a clue as to what's going on as I do so that's a bit of a relief. Anyhow, we've got a bit of a leaving do for a couple of thye guys at work this evening so even if it doesn't go so well there will always be an excuse for more alcohol. I'll probably try to do something like I did yesterday when, idly flicking through the notes pretending to revise, I noticed a bit I didn't know and lo and behold it comes up. magic  Further to yesterday's moanings, now England have managed to beat somebody (anybody) all is right with the world. The sun will shine and we'll probably win the tournament (if you ask the experts). Yes, we managed to beat Switzerland (as expected) and suddenly the experts' opinions of the team have swung right round again.  Isn't it annoying always being right.  Jack
