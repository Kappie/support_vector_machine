" urlLink Control Room ," the movie in question, "is not worth [Melody's] time or money."  But then when I was talking to her on the phone she asked her father whether she could go.  That girl is confusing.  So as for Loren and John, they also seem ambiguous.  I was about to say something to John but then I remembered he's too cool to read my blog.  Anyways maybe I need to get some substitutes.  Like Craiggers.  I've been saying the word "awexomezors" a lot recently.  I think I'll stop.  Well saying it online anyways, maybe I'll start saying it out loud.  And then get shot.  In other news, Daniel Waldinger is a cool kid.  Have you seen the music video for this?  It's freaky.  And apparently Michael Stipe is a director now.   urlLink      Have you ever seen the televised St. Vitus subcommittee prize Investigation dance? Those ants-in-pants glances. Well, look behind the eyes It's a hallowed, hollow anesthesized "save my own ass, screw these guys" smoke and mirror lock down.
