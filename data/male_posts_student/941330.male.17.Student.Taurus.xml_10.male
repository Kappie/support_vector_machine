Wtf is this...if we have one source card too little, we fail the whole goddamn research report?   That's just bs  ...Lott is a decent guy, but his rules are way too harsh. Speaking of harsh...Mr. O rags on Thi like daily...Thi: "I walked through some sprinklers, they sprayed up to my knees." Mr. O: "So I guess   they went up 2 inches?  " Wow. I want the tennis team's $35 polo shirts...the absolute personificiation of awesome. PE...still one goal scored on me. Woohoo.   No more stepping on my shoes!   Yeesh. Track was pleasantly bearable today.   Tourney: Jennifer trounced Claire (we still love you though!) 11-0 (roughly). Jason beat Shanil 10-6, but Shanil didn't want to finish. For the quarters, I'm betting Jason will beat Alex cuz Jason has the size. Alex has bad dribbles and is pretty streaky...but if he's got his shot (though   don't tell him he has it, it'll jinx him  ), then he can win. Abdullah and Jennifer...such a mismatch, I'm wasting space here...I mean come on,   Jennifer wins, no contest   :-D Eugene and Sunny...Sunny's a decent player, but honestly he's not in Eugene's league. Erik and Ankur...Ankur won their first match, but if Erik shows some of his rumored post skills...I say   it's a toss-up  .  "You might gotta go get you some Scooby-Doos, you gotta throw in the Scooby-Doos...  those are shoes by the way..."
