After a very long, boring trip (with me sleeping on the floor of the van) we eventually made it to Ohio.    the trip there:    so I was sitting there tired of the dog scratching to sit on my lap, so I went into the back (we took out the seats) and sat on the floor. I pulled out Joe's Patented Duct Tape-Box-o-Rama and played a quick game of Premiere Smackdown WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-Perstar vs. Team Anal. Aftera quick beating, I decided to build a new deck out of the cards I had in JPDTBOR and the 2 binders I had with me. I built Underedge. So the deck sucks, but it was something to do on the ride down. Flair 2nd or 3rd turned it. I slept for quite a bit of the way, too. My grandma was driving the lead vehicle (there were 2 vanss, my dad and myself in one and my mom and grandma in the other). We were following her, and she doesn't speed. At all. She needs to learn how to speed so the 7 hour trip is only 5 hours next time, like normal.    arrival in fairfield, oh:    so we arrive around 9CST 10EST and we go to her apartment. they're all down and shit cuz she's leaving, so we kinda just talk for a little bit, they go to a hotel and we chill in their apartment. me=couch, grandma=futon, mom=their bed. aqua teen wasn't on. no aqua teen = no happyness. bitches.    the morning after:    we pack up the vans, and get ready to depart. after a sobby-30-minute goodbye we get on the road, and go eat at Frisch's Big Boy. I don't know why they call it that, when the food isn't that "big". We get on the freeway, and make our first stop in Shelbyville, IN a.k.a. Hell!!!    Shelbyville:    Shelbyville has never been good to us Wisconsinites. One of the first times my sister ever went to Ohio, her car broke down in Hell. The people here are bastard asses and should all be killed. This time, it's where all tha " drama " happens.      tha drama:   So, my sister pulled in front of my grandma, and we pulled into a gas station called Big Foot. She's like "i have to go to the bathroom". She goes to the bathroom. I take the dog to go piss in the grass. Sara decides she feels bad leaving her job. Roight. Her job. *wink wink* So she grabs her clothes and heads back after a nice half hour "Make the right decision" talk. *sigh* Here comes uncomfort.   uncomfort:   What's so uncomfortable about this? There's only 2 seats open in the van, and one is the drivers. the dog  was  supposed to be w/ my sister, but she's not coming back. and she's not keeping our dog. so the dog has to ride with us. we clear off a spot on the futon in the back and I get a nice long 7 hour car ride SQUISHED INTO A GOD DAMNED MOTHER FUCKING BALL. Un-fucking-comfort.   the ride back:   did I mention I   HATE   Indiana? The people there suck, it's damned boring, and it stole Gencon. Let's not rant about that. I slept quite a bit on the way back. It was uncomfortable. I better not continue or I'll keep bitching more and more.   now:   in two weeks my sister is driving up here. yay.   post.over
