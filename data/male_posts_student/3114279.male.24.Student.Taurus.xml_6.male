      You know, lots of people warned me not to work at Service Zone. Lots and lots of people. But I didn't listen to them, and worked at that dank pit of stupidity for just three days before quitting. Nobody there knows about computers. It's amazing Dell sells anything whatsoever. In that three days that I was there I was yelled at by the payroll lady for Service Zone's errors three times, because I didn't do things they didn't tell me I was supposed to do, and I was lied to about how much I was going to be paid. So I quit. No big deal. I'd find another job. Little did I know that same lady would lie to unemployment about my status, preventing me from going back to that, and then even after two months of calling not send me my w-2. I thought it wouldn't matter, because I only received one paycheck and it has all the tax info, so no big deal. Anyway, I needed the employer number, so I had to call several times once again before I finally talked to her, and she got very angry and told me she had to call corporate for the number and it would take about 5 days. 5 days? What does she have to use, the fucking pony express? And this is a computer place we're talking about here! So I called corporate myself and gave them the what how, and then this lady calls me back today yelling at me to stop calling corporate, like I was some type of stalker. I called them once. Argh! I got the number, which kind of irritates me cuz I wanted to report service zone to the IRS. Anyway, the point of this long and boring story is that Nick and I should start an enemies list. So here it is thus far:  ENEMIES: Jill Milton, employee of Service Zone Adolf Hitler, fascist dictator and murderer of millions.  We'll add to it as we go on.   My next post will be funnier. I just had to vent.
