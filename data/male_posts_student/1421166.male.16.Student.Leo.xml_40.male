Haha...then she'll come up with all the funny lines like "absorb the sunshine!!!" Diao...everybody else says it doesn't make sense. Oh well...as long as it means something to us. Yeah man! Absorb more sunshine!!! (reminds me of plants:photosynthesis) I've decided that...Bruce Almighty is...a CRAPPY, LAME, but still MEANINGFUL show. I'm serious!!! If you think Jim Carey shows give nothing for the Brainy or Emotional one, then you're wrong! Cause, the story tells of God's wisdom...and on the other hand, a "god with all brawn but no brains"(that's Bruce starring Jim Carey). And then again, it speaks of a Christian that complained that God was not doing His job, to a Child of God that gave up his life to Him, and submitted to His will. And not to forget the great meaning of love, when Bruce prayed that his girlfriend(the one in FRIENDS, forgot the name) would be happy, no matter what that means. T.T...ar...so touching...*tears*...what sacrificial love. OK...behold...the meaning of love(my definition), love is the complete willingness to do what's best for the other, disregarding self and personal desires. Well, give me your views. Anyway, I still think love can't be reduced to a few words.For more information, please check out 1 Corinthians 13 in the Eternal Life Manual. Today. I went to school. I had like Chemistry. All about Redox Reactions. Then, went to meet Yen, Min and Jie. It was an ok time...just sat there and did some of my work. Then, went home and ate and ate and ate!!! haha...good thing I'm not a girl. If no figure would be quite a problem...haha! Then just watched TV and play computer again. Some life. Oh well...at least jie cheered me up. I just hope things will be more exciting. I still miss my friends...if I still have any, cause I feel like I don't have any. But as jie said, I'll get over it soon. So here Iam, being happy and crappy again...haha!!!
