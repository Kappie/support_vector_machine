I'm writing this post on it... everything's all set up, except transferring my Address Book contacts and the rest of the Mail messages I haven't already sent over. All in less than an hour, everything was all done up. That's using an Apple for you. My jaw is still dropping over the performance jump! Of course, after using a 466 G3, anything could be better. But Quartz Extreme has really taken it to the next level. Everything is SO SMOOTH! And talk about fast. And it's so silent! Man, that iMac really always sounded like a wind tunnel (the Bondi Blue iMacs were before they became convection-cooled), but this is so quiet. I will have a hard time sleeping... it will be too quiet in my room. LOL I like this SuperDrive. I'm watching Bridget Jones' Diary right now on it. Amazing how it does in the background, really.
