Political parties are simply trusts, oligopolizing government planning. Whatever happened to people like George Washington? He didn't put up with this kind of crap. And neither will I! You must all be destroyed!   Hypocritically, I'm starting my own political party. Fred Party Platform so far:  Find that Osama guy Aquire Canada (except Quebec) Control Afghan opium fields for highly taxed and controlled marijuana market Bring back veterans' benefits John McCain for President Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General Miss Aretha Franklin, The First Lady Nationalized Heath Care, for the most part Change name of Rhode Island to Rhodeland, for obvious reason Bust Ticketmaster Dissolve Buffalo City Government/Build Bridge with money saved Move President's Day holiday to Election Day Kill Flanders One year of military/volunteer service for all young adults Honorary championship trophies for Cubs/Red Sox/Bills Leave the Indians alone End the Death Penalty (except for Flanders) Schooling no longer mandatory. Neither is giving health care or welfare to anyone without it. One civil union is acceptable. Getting benefits from second and third marriages are not. If we ever have to fight another war, we're going to WIN it No more Income Tax; higher sales tax instead Broadband for everyone! National Identity Cards for everyone!  Fingerprinting too! Colin Powell gets an award just for putting up with the rest of us. 50 cent/gallon gas tax on personal vehicles to support better public transportation And we're switching to Metric, so forget I said "gallon" $1 coins, and no more pennies  I got more GENIOUS ideas, but it's late.
