Their planned 2002 tour never materialized because of child pornography charges against Kelly. Now they're set to open "The Best of Both Worlds" tour Sept. 30 in Chicago. The U.S. tour, which takes its name from their 2002 album, will travel to more than 40 cities before ending in Phoenix on Nov. 28. They appeared together last year at Jay-Z's concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, faces 14 counts of child pornography in Chicago and has pleaded innocent. In March, prosecutors in Florida dropped all 12 child pornography charges against Kelly, 37, after a judge ruled that photos allegedly showing the R&B singer having sex with an underage girl were illegally seized. Kelly's new album, "Happy People/U Saved Me," was released Tuesday. His hits include "Ignition," "Step in the Name of Love" and the Grammy-winning "I Believe I Can Fly." Jay-Z, 34, is the leading nominee for the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards with six nominations for his jarring video for "99 Problems," which depicts his own murder as a metaphor for his retirement from rapping. The awards will be presented Sunday in Miami. ___ On the Net:  urlLink http://www.r-kelly.com/
