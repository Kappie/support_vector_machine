Current Mood: Angry- mostly at myself Digits of Pi Calculated: 3.1459265  I'm just going to open right now and tell all of you that I’m sorry.  Mostly Garret, I’m just too stupid to notice that I’ve been a jerk and everything. Jason if you could, just let him know that I was just really angry at no one, and I'm sorry that I had dragged him down and burned any kind of friendship we had left.  I feel like I just lost someone I cared about again, and really wish that I could start this year over like how it was suppose to go.  It seems that right before every summer I screw it up again, well I’m sorry.  I've removed any kind of post that would pull you down, and hope that I won't post anything like that again.  I've actually talked to God last night; it was the first time in about two weeks.  If my sister reads this, I don't care if it sounds stupid or whatever; it’s just what I believe and what I think.  Oh God, I just want everything back the way it was, but I’m on the point of giving up.  Like Mrs. Griffins favorite saying, its like sand through my fingers.  Its true, friends are hard to hold onto, especially when they make others, you feel left out.  And now it’s my turn to feel this way.  God is about the only person who I can talk to nowadays, and I really need His guidance if he can give any.  I know why you (Garret) gave up on me, I was becoming too worldly I guess, and since you wanted to remove yourself from all these worldly things, I was next.  Well, I’m sorry for acting stupid, and I guess then if you really don't care about me anymore that’s fine.  I've known how stressed our friendship has been and it causes you more tension than its worth.  Jason, you were right, God can be my friend I guess.  I'm beginning to think it may be a good thing not having any close friends, because then there is no one to leave you.  God will always be there whether I know it or not, and I respect that.  I estimate that by the beginning of next year I shouldn't have any close friends, and I’m ok with that.  I hope that Garret, you and I could go to Pennsylvania once more some day, maybe for a week.  Thanks for being my best friend for a while, you were really cool.  Thanks Jason for being online, you were the only one who asked me about my day or how I was and I’m grateful for such things.  And I thank God for always being willing to accept me even when I’m stupid.  And of course, I’m sorry if I screwed up anyone’s feelings and I’m sorry I messed up peoples plans, because I know from experience that everything is better if I just keep my mouth shut and leave people alone.  ~Later
