We founght about everything but religion this time...and the worst part she said she really didn't want to go out with me...but didn't want to dump me cuz she just couldn't. She did say that she knew we had to break up...and I didn't want these stupid games anymore.  They had been going on for 3 months or more, and I hated it. Its been tearing me apart horribly...and frankly, mentally I feel drained. I need to go on a long overdue vacation away from everyone I know. Maybe I will go to Wyoming with my father this weekend...  Anyways...I decided to break up with Jadie. I said I was tired of the games and hated her for playing them on me constantly so I said I would see her later...much later. She didn't get it. So I said we were done...and she got offline. So I called her. She just cried the whole time...So I hung up. Then my dad came in (Mr. Sensative and buzzed on beer) tried to cheer me up only the way a half drunk father can. So I got pissed off and went to Jadies going almost 90 mph on the gravel road...  I sat outside her house for 40 minutes before she noticed my car. She sat inside for a while then decided to come out and talk. She rested her head on my shoulder. And I kissed her forehead. I tried to find the words...but none came...I couldn't believe that I had just dumped Jadie. She is the light of my life...and I dont think that I could be in a right and proper state of mind without her...  I think we are starting to be okay...kinda...I dunno. Im terribly confused. I think she doesn't want me to go...because she knows if we are totally done....then Im not going to have anything to do with her...simply because she has hurt me really bad. But she says she is living a lie by going out with me...  I love her terribly. And I really want her to be happy... I dont know what to do. We seemed okay when we were watching Patriot with her parents...but as I left I sensed some hostility...I dont quite know...  I have had many people ask me if I loved her...are they stupid? Of course I love her! If I didnt' it wouldn't be this hard to let her go...think if you hadn't eatin in days....you have a glass of milk and a slice of pizza...now throw that away...thats like me...okay...and if you dont like my analogy then F*CK OFF!!!  All I have left to say is:  Se amo Jadie siempre....
