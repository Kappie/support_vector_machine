My GCSE's finished on tuesday and now I'm found at a loose end. So now i decide to join the  wonderful world of work!  Fun fun. A note to all of you out there,  don't  apply for a job in the same place as your parents. Oh the embarrassment. Never again I tell you, never. Is it in a parents job description to be embarrasing at the most inconvenient times?? Look ^ my mind is wondering! Never felt that before, tis strange! Ya so back to work... I find myself in the desperate position of trying to earn enough money over the summer to buy a car AND insurance to boot, and enough mulah for a week in Devon with the lads. We're talking some serious workage here.  *shoots self for using suffix "age" and sounding like one of wards dreaded proles*  At first I thought that working would be kinda cool, until I realised that where I have applied to work the day starts at 0815. Ah. More lovely early mornings then. No peace for the wicked so the saying goes, or something like that. Well I'd love to carry on depositing my thoughts here (no joke I'm actually liking this!) but i seem to have developed a sore wrist from typing more than I was ever supposed to so I shall bid you all a fond farewell and  hope I get some comments!   *shakes fist*  Adeiu, Jim x
