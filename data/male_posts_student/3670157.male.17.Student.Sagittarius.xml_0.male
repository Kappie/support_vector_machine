Anyway I was also influenced by a conversation I had with a friend last night that really upset me. And after driver's ed I felt like my will was just broken and my whole being was gone and shattered.  I lie shattered here  My will has broken Overwhelmed with growing fear Life's a minor token  Chorus The World has turned away All I can do is pray that you hear my cries send Your love to bind these lies Lift up my heart work through me loose these chains, set me free  Emptiness fills me up The Death of man lives within My desires grow corrupt I see darkness coming in
