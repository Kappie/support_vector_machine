He also has lots and lots of really goog links from other media people (lots of variety and points of view).   UPDATE:  Damn - how about that. Jeff linked to me off his site. Welcome anyone who happens to drop by off from Jeff's site.   YET ANOTHER UPDATE:  If you haven't seen all of the links Jeff points out, you really ought to check  urlLink this one out . Tony Pierce puts things into a perspective that I admire. I don't completely agree with him, but at least he has some points that are worth considering.
