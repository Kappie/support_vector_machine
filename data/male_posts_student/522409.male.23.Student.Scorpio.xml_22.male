My frustration at this point comes equally from the realization of my situation's baffling parallel to the story of Sysiphus and the fact that I should grow up and be happy with everything in my life that's going exactly as it should.  Plenty of people have it worse than I, and yet I find it necessary to continue letting one person dominate my entire emotional state over the course of 3 or more months.  And it sucks... because time has proven that there's absolutely nothing in this world or any other that I can do to change my situation aside from getting the hell over it.  For once, you'd think I'd just do what's right for me instead of being the idiotic dreamer I insist on being.  Everything works so well in my mind that I can't imagine things happening any other way.  "The predictable is the thing I am incapable of predicting."    I quoted that in my livejournal back when I used to keep one.  It's a quote from this book, "The Fundamentals of Play" that was billed as the Great Gatsby for the end of the 20th century.  It was a great book, and the paragraph surrounding that line rang bafflingly true to me.    Whatever.  I'm done.  Today's been one of the weirdest in recent memory.  It's time for it to end.  And I've got rehearsal in Boston at 1.  So yeah... time to roll.  G'night.
