The 4th generation iPods cost about 23k and 27k respectively. The site is not updated so dont bother going there. So who is going to buy one and lend it to me ?  Project Billboard is still alive but due to some really ineffecient senior programmers(seems they are following my example) , the project is stalled... All those who have any knowledge of ASP.. Contact me . You might just be a part of one of the most successful ventures of Exun after Exun (The Event) and DomainSquare  Zzzzzzzzz....
