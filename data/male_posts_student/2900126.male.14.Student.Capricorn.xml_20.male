So yeah and last night I felt like I was very lonely because I was single and then  again I want to stay single because I'm too body conscious and I don't see how anybody could like me. But there are people that actually like and/or liked me like, beka ( dumped me but it's ok), megan, regina, anna sands, and some other people. So yeah I don't know why they like me seeing how I have low confidence, I'm body-conscious,and when i'm depressed I cry (i.e. when I failed my algebra test). So yeah well off that subject.  Well now it's storming and for some odd reason I'm fascinated by storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and natural disasters (don't ask why)but yeah well i g2g.
