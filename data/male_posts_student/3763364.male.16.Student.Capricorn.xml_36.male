Did you know that the tides are controlled by the moon? As the moon orbits around the Earth, it's gravitational pull attracts the oceans, drawing them in one direction or another. The ebb and flow of the tides.   Up and down. Ebb and flow. That's the way of nature. That's the way things are.  A talented singer can hold a note for a very long time, probably as long as they'd like (yes, I'm talking about you, KENNY G!), but that wouldn't make for much of a song. A song has a variety of notes, highs and lows, bass and treble, all that neat stuff that makes it sound good. It is diversity of soundthat makes good music.  Life just happens to function in the same manner. Life has its lovey highs, it's sad sad lows, but it isn't always that way. The song must change. I was one happy. Now I am sad. Odds are I will become happy sooner or later. Perhaps the low-note will last a little longer than most, though. Hey, maybe it won't. Who knows.   Like the tides, I have receded into the abyss, but I too shall return to the shore. To high up.
