End up at night, my new neighbour found it outside the lift door and my dad was going out and he saw it too and he brought the crab home.. -_-" that freaking crab is so damn smart knowing that he's going to be cook today and he run away for that little hope for him to carry on his life! haha.. Anyway I didn't went to the interview just now my friend was at Boon Lay and I don't want to go to the interview alone may be tml then I go ba.. Don't know why suddenly I feel so sad right now..
