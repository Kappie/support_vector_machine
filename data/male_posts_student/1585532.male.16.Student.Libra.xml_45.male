Competition was horrible, except for this one girl that was about 13, she was better than me!  As a matter of fact, I'm going to say hi to her on this post because she was damn good, I don't know if she reads it, but whatever.     Hi!! Damn you're good at DDR, hope to see you around sometime, it was great playing DDR with you!  Thanks for playing with me!   Anyways, I played that and got really burnt out after playing for so long, and I was trying to max combo Dam Dariam on Standard, but my reaction time was shot.  Should've done it earlier.  Afronova was awesome, I just put it on light so I could do those damn cool 360 moves.  I love doing them..people stop and stare and go "wow," which is always hilarious.  Anyways, I'm gonna wrap up this post.  Hope I see that girl again, she was badass.  -Signoff-
