Using her results to compare with mine is like comparing heaven and hell. This is totally crappy man. THAT'S IT!!! She'll be my sole motivation! I'm gonna work hard and score good marks so as to prove that I can be like her. It's gonna be tough work but I'm sure if I have the determination and patience, I believe I can succeed. Though LY might not know that I'm using her as my motivation and gauge, I just hope that she don't mind if she finds out. This is when my journey starts......
