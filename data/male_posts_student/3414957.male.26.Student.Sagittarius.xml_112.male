This guy at work was bitching and moaning at me, about how the work studys' don't do there job and thats why the big boss made new rules in the room. I am so tired of people bitching at me for the rules. If everyone used the computers for job searches and to play simple games, we would all be fine. Thats not the case though. You have idiots who spend all their time in chat rooms trying to pick up on "women", people trying burn cd's in a government room, people who are curious and try to alter or edit things on the computers and the list goes on and on. Thats why the rules keep getting more ridiculous and stricter. Get mad at the other people that use the room and that mess it up for you  not get mad at the people who keep the room open and make sure the computers work and help you type and surf the web!!!!!! I don't make the rules of this room. I am paid to keep the doors open, help vets with pc problems and thats it. Anything else I do is extra and out of the kindness of my heart. I don't think I will "go the extra mile" for these people. Robotic, I must be robotic!!!!! Arrrghh this world is sooooo frustrating.
