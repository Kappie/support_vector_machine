The night went ok, we started a game of manhunt which I struggled with, but to be honest the atmosphere was ready to split... and it did.  The Year 8s of the group (including Dickhead Dean) started shouting and causing loads of noise (You could feel the eyes of everyone looking out of their windows lmao).  Sam went in, everyone was like 'WTF' and the whole thing was in chaos for a while.  We all trapsed around for a while, again like 'WTF' until we decided to go to Tesco.  We all bought somethin' and James went and bought a massive bar of chocolate again (hehehe! yum yum) but he didn't give it to anyone for ages (noooooooo!).  We went up to the Garth where there was this wedding going on!  A blue van turned out of the road with loads of cans dangling off the back lmao (wedding vehicle with style).  Craig and Sam bliked up and down these slopes and eventually Kayla and Craig's sisters (oh god) turned up.  We stood there chattin for a while.  An old woman kept pointing out of her window and Craig's sister (oh god) and freaking them out a bit lol.  Sam then had a real go at Kayla for no aparant reason, which was really out of order, and then told her to "F*** Off"!  God knows what was up with him.  Michaela went after him, shortly followed by Craig's sisters (oh god).  Me, Craig and James sat up by the Garth for a few mins until Craig went in.  Me and James went to Sam's house where we met with Dean (the dickhead) and Michalea and Craig's sisters (oh god) outside on the drive.  Dean sat there being as insensitive and as childish as possible whilst Kayla sat there sad (I don't blame her, a certain person was being horrible... Sam!)  James dished out a bit of chocolate then after Dean had made a few more insensitive comments about Kayla, mentioned something about his... *cough* disability *cough*.  Dean chased after James with a deadly... broom, then an axe! lmfto!  He went then so did Craig's sisters (oh god).  Kayla hugged Sam, who eventually showed his face outside the house.  Me and Kayla went round the corner and met back up with Jo, Dani, James, Craig (who had come back out, without his sisters (oh god) this time).  We stood chatting for a bit and James kept flashing his freaky belly button lol.  After that we all made our ways home.  It's now bloody cold outside and there's a crescent moon out tonight... in case your were interested lol.    Night Night!
