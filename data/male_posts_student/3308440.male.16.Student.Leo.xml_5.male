Ah well no worries at least I know that i have the I.T. course at college sorted so that will be fun, i can't wait for next year to be honest you know starting 6th form college it's gonna be fun.  Anyway time to go now think i may go play football with some mates, I aint decided yet so see you all around   Current mood:  Lazy  Current music: U2-Elevation
