I also got a three way plug for my light, ac and clock all in one switch which doesn't apply to anyone but me... hehe. I went to the movies with Matt and Jay H. We saw Sinbad... Nicole I was supposed to come but she wasn't allowed to. Then we went to Friendly's, lots of laughs... I wanted to be Santa by paying for my shake and then running away without grabbing the shake but the shake looked too good to be Santa. Woof... I just realized Santa sort of is like Satan... just switch around the N, T and A. This is very general because I have short term memory loss and I can barely remember things I did the day before or even the same day! I'm shot. Tomorrow I'm hangin out with Laura M if she feels better so feel better Laura! haha ok goodnight.
