We found miles and miles of baby clothes and incomplete dining sets. One woman was selling individual disposable baby diapers for a quarter a piece. I was without coin, so I couldn't take advantage of this incredible bargain. Garn! I guess I'll just have to go another day making that long trip to the bathroom.  That evening, I returned Mr. Trilingual Hunk's phone call and we headed off to a bar in Pittsford. Yipee. I won my first game of darts, and I had a good time trying to convince a very very drunk girl that I went to high school with her.    Me:  You don't remember me?   Drunk Girl:  blah blah blah  Me:  You don't recognize me because I use to bleach my hair and wear contacts!  Drunk Girl:  blah blah blah  Marc (trilingual, bicultural, medical student hunk) thought it was cruel and I stopped trying to convince the young woman I had attended Pittsford-Sutherland High School. Ick. How could I?   Drunk Girl:  What is your nationality? (my other favorite question of all time)  Me:  American. I was born in Los Angeles.  Drunk Girl:  Noooo! You are far too beautiful to be from America.  Me:  I agree with you completely. I like you, Lindsay.  Marc, most evidently, leads a very comfortable life. I have never been allowed to enter a house so gigantic without being paid to clean it first. My humble beginnings did not prepare me for his huge house. Before entering, I started to cry, wondering why my grandfather and my mother, who worked so very hard everyday of their lives, could never live in a decent house, could never own a car, never have a backyard, or even piece of mind. What does a rich boy think when his poor date starts crying at the disparity of their lives? I don't know and I don't care. The tour of the house took about one or two hours. Too many rooms, too many bathrooms - one huge jacuzzi.   Sheila Prakash Vakharia - Mother Theresa, and not just because she's Indian. My lovely Hindustani Princess, adored by all. Of all her fans, I had the honor of being her conjoined twin all year. We had a great time eating and watching Conan O'Brien. Because of her, I met a score of fabulous freshman, and gained a score of fabulous pounds. She endured my delusions of impossible relationships, and waited painfully while I sank into my diet of vodka and sleeping pills. Always there when I emerged from my regular excursions into hell, I couldn't express how much I admired her patience. I never use the word "friend" lightly, like many people who claim to have "a lot" of friends, because being a true friend is taxing, and being my friend, even more so.   urlLink    Princess Sheila  late minion, Rex. urlLink
