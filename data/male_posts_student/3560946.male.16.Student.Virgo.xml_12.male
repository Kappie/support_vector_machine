You can write an E-mail to zacharyklaas.lavalon@blogger.com and what you write should appear in the web log.  In fact, to test it out, I've filed this post by means of this E-mail address.  If I find that outsiders or otherwise ne'er-do-wells are abusing this access, I will disable it, but for right now, it's good to get people posting!  Xon, perhaps you can give it a try?
