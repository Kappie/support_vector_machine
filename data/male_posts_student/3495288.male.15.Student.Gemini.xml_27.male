Daniel if you did come online last night and waited for me, i am sorry. My parents redecorated my room. Well at least its more spacious. By the time i got home it was already 12am and my father was still fixing a few stuffs to put the computer. I thought of calling you but instead i didn't because i scared later i call your mom pick up and scold me.  Sorry Daniel,  if you waited for me last night.    Ok here goes! haha. Well woke up really early in the morning, about 6 am, just to get ready a few stuffs like iron my clothes, packed my bags, shower, wore my clothes, cook breakfast, ate breakfast and so on. Everything was ready just in time for me to go to school for Band. I recieved a call from my instructor saying that he will be coming late as he is not feeling quiet not well and be visiting the doctor than he will pop by the band and see how things goes. After that, off i went to school in the rain.    Ok lets skip a few parts. The last part of the band schedule programe for that day was that ALL FOUR MAJORS have to conduct the band. I was already trembling because i have never conducted a band before. I went into the store room and pretended that i was conducting a band but instead i conducted a bunchfull of cockcroaches which were just flying from one end of the room to the other. When it was my turn to conducted, i shyly came to the conductor's stand (still shivering) and started to move my hand gracefully. My instructor helped me a little by telling me to imagine a dot in the air and keep hitting that dot, instead i used my friend's head as the dot hahah, there were a few times he stood behind me and hold my right arm asking me not to move my shoulder and keep my arm out and straight. I was conducting like a blind bat, just conduct any how hahaha.    After band i went home, while on the way home i caught up with my long lost friend, WEN XIN!, it was already 2years i have not talked to her and see her physically. We hugged and we talked alot. Tell each other story and all hahaha. Soon i had to go. Once i reached home i changed into my singlet and short pants. I decided to try out something different for my Circus act. For this past few months i have tried to do hand balancing. But yesterday's solo practice was a little successful because i managed to get my legs up in the air but then i tumbled over and hurt my butt and my ankle. Yay! now i can do Manupilation, Ladder, Spanish Web and Hand Balancing.    By the time i did that it was already 3:15pm. I quickly took my towel and had a shower. Got ready to meet my teacher, Mdm Anisah, to go to Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary for a cermics exhibition. I was kind of late. We alighted the bus and went straight to the school. Once there my teacher asked me and my friend to go up first as she had to use the toilet. Wah! greated and escoted by this girl. We entered this room, got air con so good!, and there is this potter on the wheel showed us how to make a few pots. He was quiet funny with all those jokes. Then there is this guy who sat next to me, he was from the school and he was quiet cute though. After that small class i went to the exhibition at the hall and decided to sketch a few of the pots there. Once done we all went to the forth floor and ate a few snacks. There were very little people there. Students leaders were seated at the back. The guy who sat next to me was there too. When i was done eating a few sushis the guy kept staring at me.I just like smiled at him and looked away. After that small snack i went and tooka bus back to Admiralty Mrt Station. From there i went to take a train and headed towards Jurong.   When i reached Jurong, i recieved an sms from someone whom i do not recognised. Well i just ignored it. Then i went to Dover mrt to go to Anglo Chinese School (Independent) to watch a concert which Daniel is in. I was lost at first when i got out of Dover so i asked the lady at the passanger service counter, she said i had to take 74 from the right of the station. So off i went, down the stairs and waited for the bus. In the bus i was a little scared because i do not know where to alight. Luckily there were a few people going there. So i just follow the crowd haha. As i was entering the school. I got a little scared because i have never been to a school that is very big and has a boarding school.I have been to ACS before but that was at a different location. I was kind of worried and scared because there are alot of strangers around, hot, cute and muscular guys around and Daniel wasn't around. I had no ticket at that moment. Luckily i saw Daniel at the back and got my ticket from him. The Auditorium was really cold. It waslike an ice box in there.    When the show started i was kind of excited because i have never been to a concert with chamber emsemble and guitar group. The show started with Choir, happy to see Daniel like walk from the side of the stage to his position. Hahah the strangest thing is that i sat the the right spot where every thing can be seen clearly. There were only like 3 other people who sat in the same row with me. I knew Daniel could see me because i could see him like looking at me. The strangest part was that when the choir boys sang the counters love to lean forward. They look as if they were going to fall!. Usually when i sang in my primary school choir, i have never like lean forward and sing with so much expression. Seeing Daniel sing it made me feel like he is a professional. He sang as if he was one Singapore Idol. haha. They all sang really nice. Only when the choir boys came out i would clap really loudly hahaha. After the boys sang, it was the chambers. From Violins till Bass. It was nice. But when the Guitar players played...i only enjoyed one song, forgot the title, there was this song which was really really really long. I almost feel asleep. After that was Choir again, YAY! get to see Daniel again, they sang. At first i thought it was going to end after the choir end because usually concert would be about 2hrs long but instead after the choir left, more songs are being played by the two other groups. "When is it going to end?", i said to my self. Luckily all three groups combined and sang together. Heheh it is fun to see Daniel sing. After the show the choir guys sang again, they sang a song from Lion King i think? no no...it was Animal Kingdom. I waited for Daniel quiet a LONG time after the show hahah. I saw Daniel's siblings after the show. They were like walking around and around and around waiting for him. I think what Daniel said was right. Daniel is younger looking that Titus hahah. Oh Daniel... i think You have a better body that Titus. I like Daniel's playful little brother... so cute! he like climbed up this smooth slope like Spiderman hahah. So cute! Daniel came out from no where after the long wait. hahah. We sat down and talked for a few minutes. He seems to be in a rush. I paid him, i owe him teb bucks coz he paid my tickets. But too bad Titus came and called him to go. Well then i too went off home all alone. Hahah. At least i enjoyed my day.   Came home SUPERLY TIRED. After a good warm shower. I went to sleep.  Well that all for now. Kinda long winded hahaha. Well take care all. Bubbye.
