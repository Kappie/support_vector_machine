I was so surprised to see that I was 4th in class. I would never have dreamt of this. I'm waiting for my Mom to reach home now. I wanna tell her the good news. Then after sectionals, my Section Leader gathered the secondary 3s and shared with us all the stuff he learned in Clarinet playing. It was really a time of learning. And he did quite some handing over. It was exciting and fun. But I guess, all this is for our challenge ahead. Our leadership days. OK...gotta go. Competition is next Friday! Wish me all the best!
