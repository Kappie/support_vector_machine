Anyway, it is probably more of a combination of the two candidates for this coming years' election, Dick Cheney (Brainwashed by Haliburton, scratch that, probably evil to begin with...) and John Kerry ("Mr Kerry! Do you  have dreams about Vietnam!?" "We were brainwashed into suggesting him for the purple heart"). Also very disturbing was the overbearing and undeniably creepy mother (Streep) who's only talent to mention is chewing ice (shudder)... Denzel Washington gave a decent performance, probably the best of a conspiracy theorist since Mel Gibson. Overall, the movie was better than the ending...
