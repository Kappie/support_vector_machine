Speaking of my mom, she had a run-in with a popular fat lady's clothing store this weekend, and she came out the loser.  It makes me wonder how many other people have frustrations like this?  Let's see, how can we put something together, like a bulletin board, where everyone in the known world can access it, and keep it cheap?  *gasp*, the internet!  Will investigate what domains are available, more news to follow....    BTW,  Love ya honey..... Hope The Boy's ok...
