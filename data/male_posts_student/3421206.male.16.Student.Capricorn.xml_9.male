She seems pretty cool. I have heard some stuff about her and I was recently introduced to her. We talked on the phone a couple of times. She called not too long go and we talke for a solid hour and maybe some more. We share the same interests predominantly. Her favorite band is the All American Rejects where my favorite band is The Jimi Hendrix Experience/Band of Gypsies. But hey these things happen ya know? She's weird though. So a I so I guess we fit right in. I think she is pretty cool. I am supposed to go meet her sometime. Either at H'ville Family Fun Center or Nashville Shores. But I am hopin she will come with me to the show I might be playing atwith some members of my band(Los Barqueros=The Boatmen). Although I haven't asked her yet. I will next time we talk. Hoefully she will say yes and com along and have a good time. Ya see my date for that night decided not to talk to me for...well going on 9 days now. So screw her. Even if I dont go with anyone I will still have a good time. Good times....good music...good stuff. Heh heh. Gregg is gone again to gym camp. 5 days. Gregg recently went to Vegas for a week. He is a very busy person it seems. I'm not. I dont have t work until Sunday which is just fine by me. Gas money! WHOO HOO!!! Thats a rarity. It happens. Well dinner is just about ready. And I choose food over all of you guys. So cyaz! (God Bless Jimi Hendrix!)
