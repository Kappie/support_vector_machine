I have been this lazy fuck since my last post, as you might notice, because no post follows the last post except this post, which has a significant time difference, which is why I am a lazy fuck. Understand? I don't.  Becca's gig was bloody awesome. Allow me to recollect. Several people (Alanna, Elise, Kevin, Brock, Laylee, actor-god Eric) arrived to listen to the precursor presentation, which was performed by a pleasant chap named Daniel Shank ( i think ). He wrote excellent poetry and essays. However, the greatest quantity of people arrived to listen to Becca Becca fucking-goddess-I-love-her-and-her-pickless-guitar. She played my personal fave  Morning Sickness as the second song!!!  One moment: conniption.  Okay, better now. But anyway, a whole crowd of school mates flooded in to listen to  holy divine  songs. This included Rachel, Evan, Katherine, Tarah, Lauren H., etc, as well as DOY members (e.g., Morgan). Becca is goddess. Sorry. But she also played "Telephone" (or "my telephone" I forget), which rocks everything.  Change subject: Her songs were damn excellent. All of them.  Change subject again: I am semi-free, for I turned in the hellish English paper I referred to in earlier posts. So that is over. However, señor Oh-My-Gawwwd (that's how he says it) Espinosa is giving us some shit test that no true human can actually study for. So that will be absolute hell.  Heather wants my Gollum voice on her cell phone. I am happied.  Lessee....nothing else to ramble about. Wait, I wrote something a few moments ago that I personally like. Though I may like because it is the only thing I have written in - what? - a month, perhaps.   Transparent  Glass ball Hovering between the glare of One thousand suns streaming past Some inborn light No light will last Because ever light has a shadow Thrown off carelessly And it constantly changes The light and the shadow Always, when one changes The other Changes And the photons filter through The clear sphere Bounce off my retina, invert Invert again, but I have myopia In both nuances of meaning Glass balls are light bulbs And crystal orbs That the cheap seer plugs in To see my face, warped in the glass Except that little bubble That the blowers couldn’t suck out They’re only blowers And they were creating a glass ball That had a bit of blue to it Or any color you would like To sell to some cheap seer in the Palm and tarot shops That spit artificial light from light bulbs And every time the night goes dark My vision It’s blurry Because I don’t want to use my lenses I want to see by myself It never happens like that Too many shadows to blend Made by one thousand suns Streaming past my car window And shining on the Glass.   Cheers, mortals. I cannot feel my toes, which are in my socks, which are in my boots. That says something about how cold it is.   listening to:  Ben Folds Live: Army
