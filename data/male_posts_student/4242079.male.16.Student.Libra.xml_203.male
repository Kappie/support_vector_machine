She didn't constantly talk to me on msn if i didn't initiate the conversation or call me repeatedly. She didn't pray for me. If she was frustrated with any mixed signals I may have sent her, she didn't let it show. At least not around me anyway. She understands that I am a growing, changing person. Especially at this point in my life. I think she knows what I'm looking for, and I think she knows where I might find it. She's content with who we are.   Shyla. I do consider you to be one of my best friends, and we do go back quite some time now. Thank you for being around, and thank you for understanding me. Happy Birthday.
