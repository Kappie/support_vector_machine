So I get there and there I see one of the biggest piece of shit plastic table I have ever seen. It looked like the sun ate thru it and changed it into 3 different shades of puke green. It was so dirty and had bugs all over it. How fun it was to pick it up and haul it over to my house. Just a little paint she says...yeah right. I will probably be taking that thing to the dunp next week!   It was fun seeing my Aunt  Uncle again. I used to see them all the time but since school and work, I dont get to do that many things. My Uncle says he is really proud of me and all but it sucks never to be able to plan for a nice longweekend or something.   I just think that I deserve more. Hopefully, when school starts, I will breeze thru these classes and have fun. I cant wait to take some journalism classes and show these punk ass kids what a real story should look like, instead of sloppy joe updates and whats the schools favorite color.
