Tomorrow I have my German oral exam, after calling my examiner a dragon last week (and yes, she did hear me) I am not entirely looking forward to it. On hindsight I think she not really like a dragon - more like  urlLink The Watcher  from Lord of the Rings [I'm not a big Tolkien fan, just someone bought me the game at Christmas which I felt obliged to play].  In other news a small ray of sunshine hit my inbox this morning with news that Ross Noble has returned from Australia to unveil his new show 'Noodlemeister'. Which is a good thing but it now makes my t-shirt for the 'Unrealtime' tour look somewhat dated. If anyone does want that t-shirt they can buy it off the site at the bottom as well as find listings for the new tour.  Music: REM - Low Mood: Alone Site:  urlLink http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/
