I dislike people who are deeply, stubbornly religous, and I dislike people who are deeply, stubbornly, unreligous. i would enjoy spending time with neutral people in general. Maybe not neutral, maybe willing and open-minded. If you are deeply passionite about religion, or you're lack there of, don't worry I dont dislike you, i just like the concept of you. I'm sure you are actualy a beautiful, wonderful person. But in all seriousness, watch nightline, it's good for you. Kopel is a conceptually cool guy. / Rip /out/   "Close my eyes just to look at you, taken by the seamless vision, and i close my eyes,  ignore the smoke ,  ignore the smoke ,  ignore the smoke ."
