I went and saw M. Night Shyamalan's  The Village  this afternoon. I'll say straight away that I loved the film. I think it is his best film to date.  urlLink  The Sixth Sense   was a good film that I really enjoyed and had a nice twist that I wasn't expecting, but for me over time it loses a bit of its appeal. While I consider it to be a well-made film, I don't plan on buying it because I know it will go the way of  Jurassic Park  (i.e. it will sit and collect dust on my shelf after being watched only once). Never saw and don't have any desire to see  urlLink  Unbreakable  . I thought  urlLink  Signs   was a good film that spoke to the spiritual nature of us all, while at the same time speaking to the skeptic and those who have gone through crises of faith. It did its job, and did it well, and was a story of redemption on a certain level.   The Village  is totally different from the above films. It does have the type of suspense Shyamalan is known for, and while the film does have thriller moments, I would not label it an outright thriller. But the twist endings Shyamalan is best known for is oddly missing in this film. The movie does have a twist to it, but it exists mainly in the lives of the characters and their simple village. Unlike  The Sixth Sense , this film's ending slowly evolves as the movies progresses, climaxing about three-fourths of the way into it. Right from the start I began wondering what was going on, then I moved to a sense that something wasn't right with this village and the village elders that ran it, then I slowly began to realize what the reality was. All of it was confirmed, and then the movie began the wind down and finally ended. When it ended we were left basically where we left off, with the status quo uninterrupted. This is probably where the unexpected comes in, because in Shyamalan's past films the world around the main characters has totally changed, along with their view of it. But in  The Village  the world is left roughly the same, except for the obvious characters who have always know what has been going on. All the actors made great performances in this film and really gave it a lot of depth. Of these I recognize Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, and newcomer Bryce Howard (the main characters). The other actors were great as well, but it was the main characters that stood out and gave  The Village  its soul.  The main characters are as follows: Edward Walker (William Hurt), the de facto leader of the village and the one man the village elders, who make the decisions, look to for guidance. We quickly realize that it was him who first established the settlement, along with the rest of the elders who agreed to follow him. Then there's Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), the quiet young man who knows no fear and seems to be curious about the woods, the creatures, and the world outside (known as "the towns"). The character of Noah (Adrien Brody) is a mentally disabled young man, essentially a little boy in a man's body. And there's Ivy Walker (Bryce Howard), who is the younger daughter of Edward Walker. She is blind, but she is smart as a whip and can see more than most people (a cliche, I know, but she pulls it off in a subtle and non-clicheic way). All four characters are involved in the story in some way and make the story happen. The other characters are nice and very well acted, but are simply backdrop.  I've debated whether or not to provide spoilers, but I can do this fairly well without. The one thing I really liked was that the movie was essentially a voyage of discovery for the viewer. We aren't shown the truth about the village or the circumstances in one sudden twist as in  The Sixth Sense  or  Signs . It is slowly revealed and we slowly begin to see what's going on, with our suspicions confirmed at the climax. Many Shyamalan fans who are now accustomed to his now clicheic twist endings might rebel against this, but it doesn't detract from the film. It was a conscious choice by Shyamalan and it worked.  Another nice twist that I liked was in Joaquin's character. He's not the hero in the film. You think that he might be based not only on the massive advertising, but also based on his fearlessness of the creatures and his eagerness to venture into the woods. But in the end he is not the one who enters the woods and confronts the creatures. Its the one person you would not expect, and not want to enter the woods (actually there are two that enter, the second being the one you don't want to enter, depending on how you feel about the character). And there's also a minor hero in William Hurt's character when he agrees to the journey and defends his decision vigorously to the elders. The villain in the movie is two-fold. On one end it is Adrien Brody and the action his character takes that leads to the unfolding of the story. The second is the village elders and their secret, and one might interpret their choice as a denial of the truth and freedom, as well as the perpetuation of fear. But they have their reasons and when you learn of them you tend to feel sympathetic and understand, even if you don't necessarily agree with them.  The advertising for the film is rather interesting. They've basically pulled a  urlLink  Master and Commander   on us. We all thought  Master and Commander  would be this big action flick; a  urlLink  Gladiator   on the high seas. The reality was that it was more dramatic and visual than action packed. The same is true with  The Village , although it may end up biting Shyamalan and the distribution company in the ass. Its billed as a horror/suspense/thriller. Its none of those things, at least completely. It is not a horror film because of the discovery nature of the picture. Horror films are packed with fast-paced action sequences that scare you, and  The Village  has few, if any, of these. Certainly not enough to qualify as a horror film. There are elements of suspense in the film, but they are quickly resolved (minus the main "battle" sequence that serves as the climax). Same for the thriller aspects. Its a voyage of discovery and a story of the village and why it is there, with elements of suspense mixed in.  The problem is that people now expect suspense and thriller movies from Shyamalan. Part of this is his own fault for making three of these types of films in a row. The other part is also the ad campaign for  The Village . With  Master and Commander  there was not only a sense that there was some drama in it, but there was some great action in it as well. But with  The Village  not only has Shyamalan painted himself into a corner with his past three flicks, but when people go to see a horror/thriller movie they want exactly that. This movie has no horror and little thriller, if any. And while it looks beautiful and was very well shot, it doesn't have the gorgeous shots that make  Master and Commander  a truly great film.  Master and Commander  was a celebration of old naval life on the high seas. One cannot say the same about  The Village . There is a sort of admiration of the simple way of life that shines through, but there's nothing that comes close to the celebration of nature that we get from  Master and Commander ; in fact, one might say we get the opposite. Therefore, many will definitely be disappointed. As I walked out of the theater, I believe I overheard one teenager say to his friend that the movie "sucked". That's because it wasn't what they came to see. Of course, this movie isn't exactly aimed at the teenage or college demographic, but still. I dare say its like going to see a movie billed as a science fiction film, only to discover its closer to the present day and not so much science fiction as you were led to believe.  That being said, go see the movie. Its definitely worth your money. Its different from Shyamalan's past stuff, but in a good way. He hasn't quite gotten out of that twist ending corner he has put himself into, but he's done a good job at working his way out. He proves once again that he is a great filmmaker.
