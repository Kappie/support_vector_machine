My sister picked me up from Gritty's after work, and we went to some Clam Festival a few cities away. Why we celebrate clams? I haven't a clue. I don't even like clams. They did  have some pretty yummy onion rings though. :) She, her boyfriend, and I did some little quarter-gambling thing very similar to roulette. And what do you know, we doubled our money! Too bad we only started out with $2. Then we went to her place and rented School of Rock, whichwas pretty funny. Jack Black cracks me up. That night, I got to sleep in the AC room. Ahhh, AC. Of course, I slept like a drugged panda. ;)  I HATE YOU, GOOGLE ADS.
