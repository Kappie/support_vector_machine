I just hope ur not like some any other "guy" I know who messages to us things  thangs of his whatever-happened-to-you  intro and that'll be the last message u will hear from him in a millenia or so. You know what I mean? Are u scared?   Shoot, I need to get more of those strong coffee in my bloodstream. ASAP. Its just one of those lanky days. *yawn    Rox,  I will refrain from replying a  "You didn't answer me when I was greeting u at messenger a few days ago. Have you received it? Just checkin' why u were screwed"  message.  heheh.
