Pirates are really mean, they are always talked about as being guys with beards and a sword and a peg leg but thats not true. My grandpa is a pirate and he told me all about them, they live in huts down by the river and go fishing every Sunday. My grandpa still tells tales of where he was fishing and caught a big ship and climbed aboard and flew into the night sky, but i knew right away that that was fake since only the guys from Styx can fly in a ship. The pirate leader, Danny Devito once rode his go kart through wal-mart and cause a hocus pokus of mumbo jumbo that only i would recognize as the work of pirates so i shrunk myself and shot my rope-gun onto the go-kart to follow him. Here is what i found out, all of the pirates ride around in a limo all night eating toilet paper and weaving quilts so that one day they can throw the GIGANTO-QUILT up in the air and block out the sun. other than that they like to do figure skating and watch tv aboard the big ship called "The Big Ship". When there is an outbreak of violence in the Pirate Community they listen to Garth Brooks musick and watch the Cabbige Patch kids till they fall asleep but occasionally they eat a man and set fire to his poodle, but that only happens when there is an alignment of the planets on a penny. Abraham Lincoln once said that four peolpe scored in tennis or something like that and it outraged the pirates so they set fire to his tomatoes and ate sub sandwiches and other than that im now training to be a pirate so i can set fire to poodles and maybe if im lucky set fire to Cody's tomatoes and then i will have the pleasure of knowing that im a pirate. But the training to be a pirate is hard work. You have to play base-soccer with a 10 foot club on stilts while walking a tight rope singing mary had a little HAM agianst two rhinos and a beaver named Andy. I talked to one of the newest pirates Codytheevildumbuglyblackafricanwhorepirate who saved the pirates from the scarvey's by yelling "arg matey swab de poop deck the scarvys are a comin'...arr" but then trajically he got hit with a flying plunger and swabbed the poop deck with his face while falling over wickedly dead. Before that happened though Codytheevildumbuglyblackafricanwhorepirate was in Nam where he had to throw his evildumbuglyblackafricanwhorepirate-leg like a boomerang and kill the Russians and got rid of world hunger. But now he is dead and on his gravestone it doesnt say his name because it costs 8 cents a letter but rather it says GUY, for some, thats all they need to remember him.
