It ended up boiling down to one of those preteen girly type movies with a "meek-girl-gets-empowered through motivated friends" theme, but with essentially adding 2 black guys who try to add funny and only SEEM like they're detrimental to the plot.  Seriously.   Shawn and Marlon Wayans both play FBI agents who apparently often screw up their assignments,  and are on the verge of being fired until their hotheaded boss gives them a rather simple assignment noone else will take.    Take two snotty rich girls in potential danger of being kidnapped, and escort them from their private jet to their hotel in the Hamptons.  Easy, right?  No.   The Wayans brothers get into a little slipup, of course to further the rather weak comedic plot. The rich girls' dog ends up nearly falling out of the car, forcing the two agents to pull over rather bumpily, leading to the girls' massive injuries of, you guessed it, a bleeding lip and cut nose.  The girls refuse to go to their party in the hamptons with a couple bandaids on their face, and they want to complain to the FBI chief about it. The two FBI agents, knowing they can't screw up again, end up convincing the two prissy girls to stay in another hotel nearby and stay there secretly, which would of course halt their plans but keep them safe, resulting in not getting fired. End of story, in reality. Shawn Wayans decides this isn't enough of a movie, because surely noone will pay for a 20 minute film, and in the two girl's stead he has himself and his partner get done up of course like the white chicks.  Actually there is reasoning behind this, because the two officers believe they might be able to stop the potential criminal and get back on the boss's good side. And there's two other officers, who add a good portion of the comedy (and not much else) by going back and forth asking each other things like, "Who would you do, Carmen Electra? Or Pam Anderson? The catch is, they both have yeast infections!"  Soon after they get to this revelation, the movie quickly gets less funny, unfortunately, and the plot gets confusing. The two new white chick replacements go through the usual "man in drag for the first time" problems, such as wearing tight pants and walking on heels, and they make friends with the actual girl's buddies. Blah blah blah, sappy womany friendship, blah blah, criminals found, FBI agents save the day, yadda yadda.   At first what seemed like such a promising film ended up being one of the most mediocre comedies ever written, especially by the Wayans brothers. It's almost saddening.   All the same, if you're into nonsensical plots behind squealing teenage rich chicks and two black Mrs Doubtfires, go ahead and see it. It wasn't the best movie for damn sure, but I suppose someone will appreciate it more than I did..  Better luck next time, Mr. Wayans?
