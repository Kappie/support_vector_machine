She said that since I wasn't here for half the term, she had too little on which to base my grade, and that I do A- work.  Colleges don't (for the most part) see term grades anyway, and since there were so few grades this term, it won't bear that heavily on my final grade.  What else...  I got my first team sweatshirt at Mock Trials today, but according to Steph, it will be too hot to wear it for the rest of the year.  I wore it a little bit today, though, because gym was cold.  Archery is fun, especially now that Ms. Perkins told me what I was doing wrong.  Dan Jung is strange; he was complaining about how this black girl kept talking to him, even though he was talking to her plenty.  ER: The Complete Second Season came today.  Yay.  Chemistry test tomorrow.  Boo.  Arnaud leaves tomorrow.  Yay.  Nationals starting Wednesday.  Yay.  Loren doesn't like my song.  Too bad.  I don't know how to end this, so I'm just doing one-line paragraphs.  Wait, let me see if I have any quotes... Aw heck, I'll just steal the one Loren wrote down because I was in that class and he'll probably never get around to posting it anyway.
