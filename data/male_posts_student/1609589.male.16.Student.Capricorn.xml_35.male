How, may i ask, if im in a different place, would i know what 9 stands for? What If i lived in a place where the area code was 948? What then? Would i call 948 and get some other guy's number? No. I appreciate you people's endless endeavor to make everything as short as possible(you can see an example of this every time someone types "ttyl" or "lylas aaf" or "sdjbnsinsijslfghslncvoauefjvmsldjkf"), but that one is just impractical.  Okay, on to the actual journal part.  I'm going to TGC tonight at about 7, I'm trying to round up people. I have Jason(possibly alex) and Eric, but nooo syed's not on. and we haven't been able to get a hold of Todd. Who knows, this might just be a 3-people thing. We'll see what turns up.  How exciting for the average reader!
