The entity of performing the play.. that was fun. But pretty much everything else about it, minus a really cool cast party at Cassedy's, was hell for me. I really don't think I ever want to be in theatre again.  Brandon said this at the "Magic Circle" before the third performance: "The theatre people were the most inviting, welcoming people in this community."(something really close to that, anyways). I have had the exact opposite experience. I wish you people were as inviting and welcoming as he says you are, because I could really use some inviting and welcoming, dammit.  I used to also have a huge respect for most of the junior guys in theatre, but a lot of them just turned out to be very different people than what Brandon was talking about. Only a very small percentage actually seem to care about and listen to their peers.. what kind of team operates like that? If you didn't say anything, you are correct. Without respect, what kind of team are we? We're just a bunch of boys and girls putting on a play. Not a cast..... no.. not yet.
