Although I will not be able to give you all GMail invites, I will post here when I have any available so keep checking back. It seems to me that GMail is Not giving out many GMail invites, if any at all. Anyways I am still on the search for those invites. Anyone i find will be posted here.For those of you searching i have some suggestions. I got my account through  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  and I think that is the best way to get one. I am still posting a swap there every day.There is another cool site I found that gives away invites called  urlLink www.geevite.com . You have to pick for numbers from 1-9 and if they are the same as the random lottery numbers you win an invite. You get 100 tries a day, and I try everyday. Again any invites I get there will be posted here. By the way, anyone who wants on orkut invite just post here and i guarantee you will get one. On other news Willie Williams will play for the Hurricanes this upcoming season. Willie Williams was one of the top recruits in the country and I am happy to have him playing for UM. The Canes are always a top team in college football and we have definetly been the best teamover the last five years. Miami continues to sign top prospects and contiues to produce NFL stars. Hopefully they will continue to produce National Championships.  See you guys later, Carlos
