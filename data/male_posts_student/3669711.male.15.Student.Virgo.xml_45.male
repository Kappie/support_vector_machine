Whenever i opened a program, even  urlLink Firefox , my mouse pointer would lag, jumping around.  Also, i couldn't click on anything.  If i did click on anything, it would pop up after the computer stopped lagging, and then go back down, maybe several times.  I finally got frusterated, and thought it might be Firefox 0.9, because it is the newest thing i had put on my computer.    I promptly went to the  urlLink Mozilla  homepage, and found out that there had been a new version released: 0.9.1.  I downloaded and installed that, but found no noticible difference.  It was still lagging when i opened it, or when the dialog came up to tell me my downloads had completed.  Next, i thought it might be the theme i have running, so i found a new one... but i still sensed no change.    Finally, i looked at the task manager to see what processes i had running.  There were about 36 running, and i checked all of them to see what they were, just system stuff, and stuff for my video card and printer.  I went into msconfig, and disabled all the stuff starting up that wasn't really necessary.  Then i went into Spybot S  D and did the same.  I restarted, and everything is working  beautifully now.  Must have been all the processes i had running.  Lets hope that the computer keeps running like this!  Lates
