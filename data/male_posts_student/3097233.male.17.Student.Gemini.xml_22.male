She did not just visit one, but she was in all of them, colour, black and white, name it and she was there... My night was restless and I didn't get much sleep, though this morning I didn't mind because I got to see her, 'interact' with her, to a dreamlike extent I guess, what my brain wanted to happen... I lay awake for at least an hour, staring at the ceiling, or at my green bed sheets... Thinking of her constantly. Knowing my luck she will be reading this one too.. Think I'm some stocker or psycho or something... Not that it matters right now because she has basically said to piss off and wants nothing to do with me from now on... With luck it was just anger spew and not what she meant... I hope...   I may as well recite some of the horrour to my readers huh? If they excised even or if I am just writing this for my autobiography or for my own hell and pleasure so I can get what in bugging my mind out on paper, [essentially].   I promised that I'd try and cut back on the flirting, because after all she is dating somebody.. I got the feeling that she still wanted a little flirting, just for fun but not too much to make her want anything.. Well that I read wrong totally, I should just ducktape my hands behind myself and do the world a favor. As a matter of fact that is what I told her too, that I should keep my hands to myself and do the world a favor, yet.. As the world of women go this made her upset/mad/pissed/angered/etc at me and she vanished from online... I would like to say, the only thing flirtatiously today was when she poked me I licked/sucked her finger, a typical thing that I've done for a long time, normally just a nip on the end of the finger or whatnot. Well as of right now, it is 8:09 pm, which is 20:09 Military time, on PST [I'm in Oregon, remember]. Either she went to bed, and I won't see her tonight, maybe not tomorrow even, or ever if she is that upset at me.. Or like she told me before, that she says things she doesn't mean when she fumes and it is best not to take it to heart and just give her time to vent alone. This is why I did not message her when she logged off, I'm sure that would be like bringing in a CAT to help with a 20 foot whole I dug by hand. Or the straw that breaks the camels back, whatever way you want to think about it.. Anybody that wants I guess can email me and tell me what they think, all you have to do is send me an email at:  urlLink falcion@gmail.com : and tell me what you thinkI should do or any thoughts on the matter, I'm the clueless boy in love with a one of a kind girl. Thanks for reading, I might write later on tonight if I have time and my dad doesn't need the computer forwork... Mom's calling now, I'll see you all up a little on the page.
