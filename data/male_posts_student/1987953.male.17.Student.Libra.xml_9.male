On his old page, www.stephenbergey.com, he has a new chat forum everyone should become a member of. I will spend a lot of time there because I am the moderator of most of the topics. If there is a thread or post I deem offensive, bye bye. I can also talk Mark into suspending your registration. But I am lenient, so have fun! Just don't offend the viewers badly! Insults are okay, just watch it! Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >  "We believe and know you are the Holy One of God." -John 6:69 NIV
