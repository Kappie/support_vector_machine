Too many individuals today are close-minded; therefore making decisions that are one sided. What I am trying to say is that we need to travel roads that have different streets to reach our destination. Professionals tend to look at what caused the problem, but fail to look at different solutions to avoid the incidence from occurring again. Ethical decision-making relies on the power of an individual to see different avenues to conquer problems that may arise. Being wise, making appropriate decisions, and confidence are the elements of success to provide excellent answers to the questions that an organization may stumble upon.
