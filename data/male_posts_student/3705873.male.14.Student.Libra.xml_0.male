After four hours of sleep, I was woken up and told that I had to go to school. Not even my school - some other one I might go to if I crap up my exams. Met a couple of cool people, but it still doesn't balance having to get up at 7 after going to bed at 3, having to wear a suit (even though it  is  nice), and having to spend 6 hours at school. Not working, but at school just the same.  At least I'm home now. Life has become sucky again.  Oobs.
