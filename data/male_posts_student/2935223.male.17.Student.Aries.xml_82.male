When I went to bring Tina home to get her IPod we listened to Chimera on the way there. *never really liked that stuff* So I took it out and put in the first CD I could find in Brittany's car, which, Ironically, was entitled "Who do you  LOVE  to  HATE. " Isn't that funny?!?! Huh? You bastards.  It's funny, people post in their blogs puts around topics and hint at things, and what does that accomplish? nothin' much. I get right to the topic, what does it accomplish? People hate me, but at least something gets done.  ************************  About 2 and 1/2 hours ago I got back from Brittany's house, I went there to eat Jell-O. If it weren't for the Jell-O, I honestly have no idea why I even got to Brittany' house. I normally woulda left after being dissed at Tina's house. I went down there and basically spent an hour and a half being ignored/dissed/pissed off.  It really is the little things that get to ya.  I'm such a hypocrite....I'm putsing around the topic.... LOOK!   Either way, it blew ass.  **EDIT**Then I took a nice long two hour shower/bath. Much needed mind you. ************************  I feel so damn lonely. All of my friends either have girlfriends or are seriously interested in sumone who likes them back, what do I have? My computer. Probably the only thing that brings me comfort nowadays.  "You try so hard to be someone, that you forget who you are." Those words were just sung in the music I'm listenin' to. **SPIDERMAN 2 Soundtrack. Thank you Kathleen**  I spend so much time with my computer, hiding all my feelings away killing things and such, that I think I've forgotten how to successfully interact with people. See...people have these things called "feelings." Computers don't. They don't have feelings, they don't make me feel lonely. I talk to my computer, and it takes the information and puts it on the screen in front of me, and I feel satisfied.  ************************  Less people seem to visit my blog day-by-day. It may just be the internet, but, even that gets me mildly depressed nowadays.Boy, I am a sad excuse for a life form.   "But I have a purpose"* she is the one* "and I have to fight this"* she is the one* "villian I can't knock down." *she is the one*  Man, I love this sountrack.  Either way, it's probably because of my retarded teen-angsty ways. "oh my god, the world hates me so much. My life is terrible. Why does everyone hate me?" heh...where have I heard THOSE words before??*cough* previous topic *cough*  I'm gonna go now...  I know that I forgot sumthing....oh well. Peace Out!   Spense
