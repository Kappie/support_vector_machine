Michael, you are disqualified from the jonah's pocket sweepstakes because you had been posting.  That means I get all the lint, the loot, and everything else at youth group.   I must appologize for the cuelty of my parents.  If it makes you feel better, I'm at my computer unable to work on my report because of my dad's horrible guitar playing.  You try and think with this racket.  Jonah, I don't understand the new scheme.  Everyone else, post, for the Admin. commands it. So the rest of you are also Admin.s, but I am the origional. It's like vampires. I'm the Admin. King. But thats about it. I have nothing else to say. Except that I took Kaylee out to see Tech's Faculty musical! Well, technically my dad took us, as well as my sisters, but we had fun anyway. More on this later, probably in the lobby(check the new links)  There are times for breaking down, and then there are times to get Funky. This is one ofthose Funky times
