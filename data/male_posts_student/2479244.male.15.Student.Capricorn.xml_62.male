Classes become more boring, clocks go only 1/3 as fast as they used to, and people become 3 times more irritating. But, fortunately for me, I know that there is always one thing that brightens up these lengthy days. I like it because whenever it comes along I can't help but get energetic. Everything is so much better and quicker and more enjoyable. Classes are more fun, humor is better, smiles are easier, but unfortunately, time goes by so much faster. What a  fucking  shame.   I wish I could just trick myself into thinking it was a miserable experience and let the placebo effect slow time down, all the while I am secretly enjoying her company like I always do. Yes, that one thing that brightens up such shitty days is a her and she has a name: Heather. It's been such a long while since I've even considered being involved remotely with anyone, but this last month or two has been one of the most enjoyable of my life, and I say this in all honesty. I wouldn't trade any second of it for anything, and I realize that to me that is such a big deal. There are very few things I can enjoy so much. It seems weird, but I even enjoy the anger and the "abuse," the pity and the loathing, the make-believe insults and the efforts to make me look like a fool (which seem to work quite a bit.) Yes, to other people it seems very awkward, but I know that it's all just there for poking fun.   So I hope for these last days, and all the last days after that, I will feel this way.   Woo.
