Never offer to share an apartment with your best friend's boyfriend/girlfriend... what happens if/when that boyfriend/girlfriend becomes ex-boyfriend/girlfriend?  If all goes well, life will be fine.  But when ever does all go well?  All this really does is put you smack dab in the middle of a relationship (that's not yours, mind you), hearing all the good and all the bad, without anywhere to just get away from it.  Suddenly all the little things that bugged you that you tried to ignore come roaring back and just leave you frustrated with the situation.  Plus there's always the possibility of the original friend not feeling able to visit.  Another bad thing would be if you really like your roommate.  Then it just gets bad for you, trying to have to juggle friends, and that is not a pleasant hobbie... trust me.  Learning Life's lessons... the hard way.
