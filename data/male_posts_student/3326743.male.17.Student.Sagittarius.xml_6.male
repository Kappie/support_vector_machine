I'm not one of those people who says you need to read between the lines, but Paul says he is mindful of Timothy's tears, and he seems to be giving encouragement.  If anyone was going through a hard time for their faith then I would recommend II Timothy.  I've been trying to read more since I have more free time now.  It really helps on the epistles to read the whole thing at once.  Mr. Huff was right.  It would be cool if instead of doing a chapter study we did a book study.  It would be a lot of work though.  Well, I don't know all the reasons why no one else has posted, but we'll figure things out at the meeting.  See ya.
