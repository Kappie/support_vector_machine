Then, wait about ten miuntes and put her back on the line while wildly screaming some random woman's name.  Like this, "Oh, yesss, (insert name here)"  Then when she asks what's goin on, simply say, Umm... "I'm sorry hun, I didn't realize my time was up.  You were saying something about the time billy called you.... blah blah blah.... it doesn't matter what you say after the "my time was up" part, but you do have to somehow tell her w/o straight up telling her that it was phone sex that her time was up for.
