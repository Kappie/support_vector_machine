I'm getting used to the South, I haven't seen that many Confederate flags (if you count a Confederate boogie board I saw...).  The people are really nice, I haven't heard any country music (but I have gained respect for some of it), and I have yet to burn my lily-white ass...  All in all, I'm having a great time.  It's just so hot that I don't have much patience to write, and blogger's publishing is down...  Go America.......You know, I wouldn't really consider North Carolina to be the south if it didn't have the Confederate flag, and if it did have a wider racial spectrum...
