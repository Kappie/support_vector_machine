Well, the fact that I'm a psychopathic serial killer could possibly strike fear in the hearts of some... but for the most part, people are cool with me going on my killing rampages.  ^That's all a joke, if you don't know me... (or is it? muawhahaha...)  Here's a list of official phobias that kinda sound like my name:   Cyberphobia  - Fear of computers or working on a computer.  Cyclophobia  - Fear of bicycles.  Cymophobia or Kymophobia  - Fear of waves or wave like motions.  Cynophobia  - Fear of dogs or rabies.  Cypridophobia or Cypriphobia or Cyprianophobia or Cyprinophobia  - Fear of prostitutes or venereal disease.  Psychophobia  - Fear of mind.  Psychrophobia  - Fear of cold.   Come on. Fear of  prostitutes ? This is just more proof that people like to make up things to justify themselves. Do people really have a sincere feel of dread at the sight or mention of a prostitute? Don't get me wrong, I think selling your body for sex is wrong, but fear of prostitutes? Weird. Each man to his own I guess.  Hey, my big bro Abe linked my blog to his blog, so I'm going to return the favor. Go check out my brother's web log or BLOG at  urlLink http://www.onarresdesign.com/blog/ . He's a cool college kid, so his life should be somewhat more interesting than mine. Here's a pic of him...  urlLink      Well the reason I mention fear is because in 20 minutes, I'm going to head over to foursquare church over on challenger to play in the school's spring concert. Now... I'm not in band, though I play alto sax. I told Mr. Lee, the conductor, that I would play in the concerts if he would let me go on the band trips to Biola and Anaheim... So now it's time for me to fulfill my end of the bargain.  The problem is that I have not practiced with the band. Even more of a problem is that I haven't practiced the music at all. As I type this, I still have no idea what it is we're playing tonight. I guess I'll just have to wing it.  And that's what I'm fearful of as of now...   Cyisadummyaphobia : Fear of not being prepared for a band concert... or just fear of Cy not being prepared for something... Use it. Just like "Get your face out of here"...  Anyway, Mr. Lee just called me. I've got to go! See ya later and um... GET YOUR FACE OUTTA HERE!
