I mean... You know what I mean...  Haha... Muthusamy is going to get the "Diane(Survivor 3) Award." Because that's exactly what he does, boss people around with his big fat mouth... Actually it isn't fat, but it's black. So anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around, and when people stand up to him, he cries. There was one particular time, when the rehearsals for OM were to be done in front of the Vice-Principal, and Diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy. So naturally everyone protested and yadda, the case was brought to the teacher. In the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears, Diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group. Oh my heck, how many people have an attendance like you... I mean I don't even go! We were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers, because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing, and just go on doing what he wants to do...  Actually it's pretty sad that I'm probably not going to do OM again, because I really loved the experience of staying in school till late, and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods... Haha... Go OM!
