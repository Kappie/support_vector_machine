We have lost many more American lives by attacking and occupying Iraq rather than if we would have dealt with the Iraq "threat" diplomatically. Not to mention all the people dead who had nothing to do with this crap at all. Bring the troops home. I do not want to see any more lives lost in this senseless war.  Shelly has gone to seek shelter from Hurricane Charley... It's making landfall down there anytime now. I'm listening to internet radio and it's making landfall around Port Charlotte/Sarasota/Fort Meyers... supposedly. Doesn't mean they're off the hook. Pressure is dropping... 125 mph. Certainly not the worst I've ever seen. I think people are overreacting... I've seen them all before time and time again. I do have to say, better safe than sorry. I think it will go a little further south than the tampa area... I was originally thinking Naples, but it moved, so a touch north. Yes, it will be bad, but only in a range of a few miles around the eyewall. Pure luck... on Friday the thirteenth, at that.
