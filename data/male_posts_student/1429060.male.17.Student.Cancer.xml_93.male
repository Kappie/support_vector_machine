Poe doll dances around every night at precisely eleven fifty-seven pm its eyes begin to glow with the digital burn and I watch it rising out of the floor with a purple mist creating its tattered robe barely smiling through its stitched mouth it dances two feet off the floor spinning feverishly in a wide oval and the tatters fly out in a ring around it it sings with a faint wail a faint wail the cat's cry in a human throat of a little serene and faintly ominous thing? and the spark on its back begins to spread leaping to its tatters and its stick hands held out like a scarecrow and then lights up the head in a blue yellow flame its eyes are burning brighter than its personal inferno the Poe doll begins to wobble its tatters are fluttering unevenly and its wail dies away the Poe doll sinks back into the floor at twelve eight am precisely the grisly cadaver of a dream I sewed its lips together and lit it on fire.   Does someone have any insight into random thought who could explain this?
