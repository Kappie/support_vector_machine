After that, i wasnt accepted back into my home school and was sent to davis junior high to be evaluated (in which i passed with flying colors.) This was obviously a bad decision on my part to say those things, i had never had any kind of history in the past and i had never even gone on a trip to the office. After i got out of Davis Junior, it was a battle to get me back into my home school but we succeeded. After being at school for 3 weeks things were going great, i was having a great time with school and anxiously waiting for summer vacation like everyone else. Until at the beginning of my 4th week, i was going to court for what i did, it wasnt really any big deal because my lawyer breifed me on what the outcome would suppossidly be so i wasn't too worried.        After walking into the courtroom and talkiing with the judge things werent going too bad, but they werent going too great either. The judge decided that in the victim's defense (the "victims" were not present at the hearing) she would remove me from my school, we had a meeting with the victims before i went back into the school where they agreed at me going back to my school. So after working so hard and doing everything that was expected of me, somehow i still came up short, now i have to try and fit in with a school of totally new people. I had talked to one of my friends at my old school who has connections to a few people at my new school, she commented that everyone over there thought i was a "weirdo."   Right now im at a loss, and dont know what on earth to do, or what im doing.
