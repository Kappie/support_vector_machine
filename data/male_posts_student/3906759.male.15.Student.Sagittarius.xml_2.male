There will be times when one will need help in college.One can learn fromtheir mistakes, but better to learn from a teacher. This picture showsthat you can ask questions and get answers. It's better to ask than not to say anything at all.Don't be afraid to ask questions to problems you don't understand.   (Picture will be posted soon)
