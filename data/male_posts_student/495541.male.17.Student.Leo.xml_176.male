I took the time to register my blog here and I think anyone reading this with a blog should do the same.  The site is called  urlLink eatonweb portal .  It's pretty much a huge weblog directory and you can search by topic and region etc.  It's pretty cool really.  I everyone to register because it's cool to read peoples blogs from around here.  So yeah!   Listening to: DJ Format - "We Know Something"
