Yes, I read each and every post. It's kinda hard to stop when you've already been reading 80, 90, 100, 120, and 135 posts because you keep thinking "well, I've made it this far, why stop? Besides, what she's writing is funny. Just 30 more minutes and then I'm definitely sleeping." That's how it goes for me anyway. Well, I'll tell you while that may have been a good idea on a Friday or Sunday night, it's a really bad idea when you need to be at work tomorrow because it means that your sleeping time is cut in half. Bad idea.  That is all.         -- Feanor
