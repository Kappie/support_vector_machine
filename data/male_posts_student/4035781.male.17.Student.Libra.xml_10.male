Very cool guys, lots in common with a bunch including University courses and love for martial arts and just having fun. Had some crazy misadventures, and practiced our clown car routine with a jeep.  Played some "night soccer" got me in some trouble with my folks, but whatever, slid right off my back like water. Partied last night, was great. Oh, also sold my old compound to Josh, yay! Today, did some driving - was all good with instructor and my father but my mother is a biatch to drive with. She needs tranquilizers I swear.  On the up side I think I'm safely over breaking up, yay! So, time to set off after that rising sun. Meeting girls is hard though, least while not in school.  All I feel like saying for now, if you want more information please contact the Jester.
