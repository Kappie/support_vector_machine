Then about 6th period...ill jus tell the truth, im tired of hidin it...the girlz suck really bad. I mean they cant even run 2 linez on time!!!! *cough* meagan *cough*...i mean shit, if u cant do it, then its gonna piss me off...and im not that pissed that often, but lately vball has jus been gettin on my last nerve...then we had to scrimmage the varsity girlz...i mean damn...they need some serious help...no joke...they cant pass, they cant hit, they cant do anything!...wtf!...and this is varsity for cryin out loud...we beat them 25-9, 25-10...and we could only hit backrow and tip when we r at front row...HOW EASY DO WE HAVE TO B ON THESE GIRLZ!...i think they need to get use to us poundin the ball in the front row and stuff, so when they play bigger competition, they will b ready. I mean damn...they cant do anything!...my God b with them this season. And im jus fed up wit vball in general right now folkz...im not diggin it lately...i mean im sooooo burnt out. Like everyday when i go to practice im like, "y am i here?...y do i put up wit pplz stupidity and stubborness?"...i want this summer vacation to b the most enjoyable summer ever!...all i really want to do is hang out wit stephanie, have a blast wit my friendz, and relaxin. Stephanie is the only one keepin me sane right now...and i am blessed that i met her and for all the thingz that are happenin between us right now...:D...i jus really need a break to get rest, get my competative spirit back, and start to like vball again...cuz right now...its not on my top 5 thingz i want to do...so yeah...thats my opinion...and if u have a problem wit it, then live wit it cuz i dont care what u ppl say...im sayin what needz to b said...live wit it!...payce outside!
