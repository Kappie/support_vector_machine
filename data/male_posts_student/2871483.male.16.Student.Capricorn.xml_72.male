For all of you who tried to make me talk about it, I appreciate that you care, and I'll talk about it later.  -  For everyone else who decided to act like a total fucking asshole to me, don't be the least bit surprized if you wake up with a pitchfork in your chest and a horsehead in bed.  And you wish I was fucking kidding.  -  I haven't slept in two days.  Well, that was the case untill I got a four hour nap, which sucked.  -  This stupid migrane keeps coming back, and I had to indure marching practice with that.  Okay, if you don't think thats a big deal, imagine you're trying to pay attention to your rank in the hot, hot sun, with Dr. Beat beeping it's infernal death cry, Julie being super bitch (which is redundant to say.), no food or water, no sleep in two days, and you've got a fucking migrane to deal with.  Yeah, sleep was glorious after that, even if it was only four hours.  -  A good midnight snack.  Make a quesadilla (for those of you who don't know what that is, it's cheese melted in a tortilla) and put pepperoni's in them.  Oh, it's fucking good.  -  A lot of people in my house could tell there was something wrong with me, because I was eating marshmellows, my comfort food.  Anyone who's seen I Am Sam, remember when Michelle Phifer was chowing down, thats exactly what I look like.  -  I'm gonna try for some more sleep.
