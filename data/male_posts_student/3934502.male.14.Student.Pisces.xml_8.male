Not that it's supposed to be a great achivement, but more like I haven't actually passed up the previous few maths assignments. ^^ I wouldn't be surprised if I failed my maths... Anyways, I'm still on "good" terms with Samuel Kwek (Shamuel Quack/Sa Mao)... If you're from 2B you should know what I mean... Heh heh heh... Sacarsm aside, as I write this post right now I can hear a lot of booming in the distance. I know it's pretty rainy these days, but these booms aren't the normal rumbles of thunder - instead they sound like cannons... And  very  much like cannons at that. I wonder if it's a live-firing exercise out there... But the sounds just come from every direction in the north, so if it is indeed a live-firing exercise, I must say it's pretty darn far inland. Then again, I could be wrong. Thunder is, after all, quite frequent in this areas and it wouldn't be much of a surprise if it was thunder. But it can't be, because the booming just stopped altogether... Oh well who cares? None of my business riiite? The whole day I was confined to the house to read and read and read... Books of course, but I managed to get a few minutes to myself and the computer, as I have just done to write this blog post. My mother had a leg injury last week because she fell down, and during her retreat on Friday, she fell down again, so now that leg injury has gotten from bad to worse, so she's pretty much disabled for some time to come. As of yet, I don't think she might be able to go to work, so that means she'll probably be at home for the next few weeks... Eeek! Byee... My time online is up!
