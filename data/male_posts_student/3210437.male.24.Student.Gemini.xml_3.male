So, in my beginning...   THE FAMILY   I was blessed by God even in my very first moments because I was born into one of the most wonderful families.  My father and mother were very loving and excited about me, their first and only son.  Though I have always been, and continue to be, closer to my mother, I do not fit the stereotype of having a distant father.  In fact, if anything, my father and I were too similar.  We were so much alike that it caused frustration.  Regardless, I cannot think of a single basketball practice, much less a basketball game, that my father didn't come and watch.  He was always there and always loving.  In my opinion the most damaging thing the stereotype of "homosexuality being the father's fault" has been the destruction it has caused in my father.  Despite my continued reassurance of his innocence, he continues to blame himself.  It is one of the two nearly insurmountable problems my father has with coming to terms with my sexuality.  As I already said, my mother and I have always been close.  I don't find a problem here.  My sister and my father are closer than my mother and my sister.  I think it is primarily a personality issue.  My mother and I have more in common; we view the world in a more similar way.  Even as a child I can remember talking with my parents about school or church and finding myself thinking more in line with my mother than my father.  So, for better or worse, I feel a strong connection to both parents, but a stronger connection to my mother.  Jennifer, my seven year elder sister, was very excited about the new baby when she learned I was to be born.  She didn't see me as competition; instead, she saw me as a toy.  She loved to take me off to her room and set me up in a high chair and pretend she was my mother.  And, as I got older, she began to take me to her room and "play school" with me...her as the teacher and I as her student.  We never fought too much, and I attribute it to the fact that we were so far apart in age that there was very little ground upon which we could argue.  I looked up to her.  She was my big sister, and despite challenges, we still love one another deeply.   THE STAGE   I grew up in Clinton, Tennessee, a small town outside of Knoxville, and my family faithfully attended one of the local Churches of Christ in neighboring town Oak Ridge.  This small town and my very conservative upbringing made many of the challenges I would face in my life more difficult.  Being gay in Clinton wasn't a popular thing (and still isn't).  Of course, I wasn't the only gay person in town, but no one really knew we existed.  Years later my mother would compare the situation to the albino African Americans years ago who used to live as African Americans in one town but then leave and go to work as white men in another town.  These men could work as white men in these distant towns where their families were not known.  We, like the men working as Caucasians, are a silent minority.  There is no visible outward sign (unless a person is a "flamer"...who makes their sexuality apparent).    If you passed me on the street, most of you would not have any idea that I am a gay man.  And I know that is true because it happens every day.  How many gay people did you pass today?  One?  Two?  Ten?  Who knows?  I don't even know.  I can't know how many people I pass that are gay because the homophobia that runs so rampant in our society causes self disclosure to be a rare thing (and gay-dar can only do so much!).  What I do know...I live in Abilene, TX...there are three conservative Christian Universities in this town.  There are more Baptist churches and Churches of Christ than I can count.  There are LOTS of old people...this is a retirement town.  This is a conservative Mecca.  AND, in the midst of all of this, there is Exodus MCC.  This little church that is open to gays and lesbians has reached 125 members on a good Sunday morning.  More than that, there are hundreds of other gays and lesbians at the one gay bar in town.  We are everywhere.  You may not know us...or more likely you may not know you know us.  But, you do.  We are your friends, your family, and your co-workers.  The most important thing I am trying to say: we are just like you.  What I wanted to show in my "beginnings" was how "normal" I am.  My family is not so different from yours.  In fact, I was luckier than many of my childhood friend to grow up in a family free of divorce.  I hope that you will continue on this journey in time with me.  Now we know the beginning...next will be the dreaded...ADOLESCENCE!!  :)
