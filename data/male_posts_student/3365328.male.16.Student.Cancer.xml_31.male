I've been mainly hitting the beach (not literally) every day, and getting irritating amounts of sand and salt all over me. But I'm not bothered, I get to waste away the days floating on the sea on a rubber ring! Not to mention the endless bikini-clad ladies on the beach...  On a side note, if you don't own the Kings of Leon album Youth and Young Manhood, then go steal it from your local library or something. It's the best!
