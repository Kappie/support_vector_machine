It is too early to tell if this will develop into more than just sporadic resistance to injustice inside the Muslim community, but without a doubt I think these two articles represent the sentiment of a lot of women in the Muslim community. What I am thinkingmight, might, happen in the next decade is a resistance to the corruption of Islamic clergy and the Muslim community as a whole, especially the hypocrisy. This is what Islam is about... hehe  urlLink Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque    urlLink Woman's Mosque Protest Brings Furor in the U.S.
