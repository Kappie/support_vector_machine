To change the subject for now, Wednesdays continued to be nice.  Today was pretty much a breeze.  Nothing even worth mentioning really.  Which is fine with Tyke.  After school was ok.  Stayed after for about 49 seconds and then went home.  He left after about 10 minutes at home and went to Factoria to get pictures taken for his passport.  It is fun getting all of this stuff done.  Then they went to Gottschalks for his mom and Tyke got some socks (he's excited to wear them tomorrow tee-hee-hee).  Then they went to the fabric store by Farget and got some dinner at Teriyaki Bistro.  Came home and ate that well.  It tasted good.  Then he played some ESPN and shot some downstairs hoops.  Oh, Tyke just went away but Amed was saying something to him online.  Then he closed the window.  Sorry bout that.  Tyke doesn't have strep throat to answer that question but his throat still does hurt a little bit.  The rest is just some cold stuff.  And yeah, things aren't perfect in Tyke land.  It's one of those situations where...damn, this is really hard.  It's something Tyke wants to talk about on here but he knows he has to be careful because of past times.  It should now be obvious at least about what Tyke is hinting at though.  But this is a really tough thing to talk about.  And the times at which Tyke most wants to talk about it, he talks about it the least.  Which isn't enjoyable.  Why this happens is because Tyke gets too busy and then wants to get some sleep so he decides to stop himself.  But it just makes him think about it more.  It's probably about time for a Dr. Phil Lelee chat.  Those are usually pretty helpful.  They at least give Tyke some good feedback.  Amed chats sometimes give some good feedback.  But they don't match Dr. Phil's.  Nonetheless, Tyke can't do anything about his situation.  That has always been the worst part of Tyke's life.  He really wants there to be something he can do.  But there has never been anything that would help.  And as you have read before, he tried.  To no avail.  That has been the result from all of his attempts.  Even dating back to elementary school where things were really much simpler.  The girls didn't really have boyfriends back then and Tyke only had a limited supply to pick from (poor use of words there).  But now everything seems so much more complicated.  And if Tyke reads this in 10 years he will think he was being a stupid jackass.  Well, probably not that but he will most likely laugh this off.  This must be what adults in movies and TV and all that mumbo-jumbo mean when they say that high school is a bunch of drama.  Tyke doesn't think that he has drama in his life for most of the day but then at night he just feels like he is too caught up in the moment to realize it.  At night he has hindsight.  And hindsight is always 20-20.  In reality it is just way too complex for anything to work right at this stage.  And waiting sucks.  Waiting is so very hard.  Maybe it is easier because Tyke hasn't had a relationship in the past that he is waiting to have again.  But Tyke feels it is harder because Tyke doesn't really even know what he is missing out on.  Because maybe if Tyke knew, he wouldn't be missing it so much.  He would realize that his imagination isn't really what it is.  But that doesn't seem right.  It can't be right.  T.Y.K.E.
