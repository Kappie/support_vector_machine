For high school aged persons... or those who want to just goof a bit...  You are a member of what groups or activities?   Band     Sports club (Basketball, Football, Track, whatever)     Cheerleader     Science Chess, or Computer Club     Newspaper or Year Book Staff     Nothing... you just want to be left alone.     (Be patient, it may take a few seconds before your browser reacts)   and you could choose more than one answer, and so i chose the first two obviously, so heres what i got (SUCH a joke!) :  "Will you be a Happy Adult??" - Results:  You will be a miserable, neurotic, whiner of an Adult!~! You are a Preppy Jock/Skank Bitch who makes the lives of those who do their own thing miserable in a lousy attempt to make yourself feel bigger. Grow up and get a life!! Just because you are pretty/handsome and popular, with Daddy's money to get you the coolest styles and fast car doesn't mean you are the shit. You are an asshole. Accept it, and now change it. High School is nothing in the greater scheme of life, and once you graduate, you won't be the same "Popular" person you are now. Real life isn't about gossip, styles, nice cars, and money. It's about being kind to one another, accepting responsibility for all your screw ups, working your ass off to pay the bills, and wondering if you'll be able to make rent next month because you might be "downsized" or how to pay for the braces your kids need. And I don't care HOW much Bling Daddy's got... he won't bail you out for ever.    how off is that? i mean, come on! lol...wow...the world these days...  LOVE YOU ALL!! *blows hugs and kisses* moo ~ lauren
