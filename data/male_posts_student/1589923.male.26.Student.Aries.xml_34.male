So much so that sometimes, i find that i can't really relate to ppl very well or ppl relating to me. Maybe i'm too much of an aloof person? i dwell in being alone? to totally isolate myself and not speak a single words. To save my breath for last. I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with me? Do i have a problem interacting with ppl? I feel like i no longer know myself or who i really am. I m not sure if the things i say, the words i type, the things i do even make sense at all. And i m simply just living each day without knowing why. What defines me? and how do i know that this is what makes me unique and different from everyone? In a positive way or an abnormal way? I feel that i have lose myself and i'm trying to be someone that ppl will feel comfortable with. in the process, i really think i am trapped in numerous mirrors of myself, searching for the my real identity. Is this how my life going to turn out for the rest of my existence?
