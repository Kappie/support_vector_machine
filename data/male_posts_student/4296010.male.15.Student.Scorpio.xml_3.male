I hate everything about you Why do I love you Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven't missed you yet Only when I stop to think about it... I hate everything about you Why do I love you Only when I stop to think About you, I know Only when you stop to think About me, do you know I hate everything about you Why do I love you You hate everything about me...why do you love me? *sings " Home "* I'll be coming home Just to be alone Cause I know you're not there And I know that you don't care I can hardly wait to leave this place No matter how hard I try You're never satisfied This is not a home I think I'm better off alone You always disappear Even when you're here This is not my home I think I'm better off alone Home, this house is not a home By the time you come home I'm already stoned You turn off the tv And you scream at me I can hardly wait until you get off my case No matter how hard I try You're never satisfied This is not a home I think I'm better off alone You always disappear Even when you're here This is not my home I think I'm better off alone Home, this house is not a home This house is not a home I'm better off alone *finishes singing all these wonderful songs by 3 Days Grace and my hands hurt like heck from all the typing* *yawns* I'm very tired, I think ill sleep soon. That way I can wake up early and go and buy 3 Days Grace's CD in the morn and have these wonderful songs. Well nighty all.
