Well, technically I still have to show up at least 5 more times throughout the next year.  Long story. But it sure feels good to be free.  Powell Street Festival happens every year during the first weekend in August to celebrate Japanese cultural heritage, specifically the small population of post war Japanese immigrants to Vancouver.  There was sumo wrestling, traditional dancing, games, arts and crafts and best of all, food! I'm so hooked on this delicious dessert called imagawayaki, which is a small pancake treat with red bean paste in the tasty middle.  Standing in line for this under the hot August sun was worth my while.  Later in the day, I went to Playland, which pales in comparison to Canada's Wonderland, and I overcame my fear of coasters.  The trick is, during the free fall, open your eyes and let yourself fly off the seat a little.  (After some of the coasters in Wonderland, I didn't think I'd ever go on one again. ) I ate so well today, too. Lots of imagawayaki, cotton candy, churros, and it is only 10pm.    I conquered the fear of coasters, but I wasn't prepared for the Haunted House.  Sure it's a silly little maze with actors ready to jump up and scare you, but I forgot that I can't even sit through a horror movie I'd already seen once before.  Luckily I had someone with me to roll me out of the Haunted House.  It wasn't so bad that I covered my eyes and ears the whole time...was it?  So cousins, stay posted.  Remember that even if you have nothing to say, it is still worthwhile hearing whatever it is you have nothing to say about. Make sense? Good. Keep writing Ronald, Jun, Lovielyn, and Cin!
