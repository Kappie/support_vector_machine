The 25th anniversary celebration presentation I mentioned earlier was postponed due to lack of interest, everyone was busy.  Our scholastic bowl finished our season second regionally, which I think is pretty good... On a related note, last night I went to a trivia night at someone from work's church. There were 4 other librarians there, plus some other people, and we came in first! $120 grand prize divided amungst us, although we did donate some of it back to the chuch. It was much fun.  Did you know that golf is technically an acronym? yes, it is. It stands for gentlemen only, ladies forbidden. Go figure.
