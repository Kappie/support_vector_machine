Here's a list of recently rediscovered songs:  Stray Cat Strut - Stray Cats Still Rock and Roll to Me - Billy Joel Uptown Girl - Billy Joel Song 2 - Blur Lust for Life - Iggy Pop Sabatoge - Beasty Boys I Smell Sex and Candy - Marcy Playground The Freshmen - Verve Pipe  Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.  -  I had a crapload of homework this week.  And you will all be proud to know, I finished ALL OF IT!  Woo for me!  That, and Mrs. Klaas moved the paper to Monday.  -  Career unit was pointless this year, just helped make worse that sinking feeling I get when I think about college.  -  I found out it's really easy to peal stamps off of letters.  I guess those college information letters have some use.  -  I took the bus home the past two days, it felt weird.  -  And, to the many people I promised that I would see Hello Dolly on Opening night,  I'm sorry!  -  I've been trying to eat healthier, having salads or sandwiches at lunch and for snacks, eating a full dinner.  I figure it's about time I take care of my body.  (Not that I won't still eat junk crap.  I don't have that kind of willpower.)
