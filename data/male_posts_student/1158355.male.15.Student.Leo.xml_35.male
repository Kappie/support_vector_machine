Today, another boring day. Just like every other school day, I can't fuckin do my homework. I think my brain is decreasing in size. Shut up Paul. Track was pretty fun. I saw Dan and Pat doing silly walks in Badminton. That's a cool sport, I should of tried it. Well, today in track I ran with Matt K the whole time and we were doing pretty good... RIGHT MATT! We had to run inside the border of the high school around 15 times. It was funny listening to Matt's silly breathing and my SECRET EATING! Oh ya, as you all know my ex girlfriend is now going out with someone she doesn't like at all. It's very strange. I don't think people want me telling other people these things but what the hell! I just have to say Maria, you are a brave one to stand up against war tomorrow even when getting put down as a cut. God speed. You made a great decision. I would make that decision but I'm retarded and could care less on how our money is spent. I'm gaining back my talent at drums for anyone who wants me for a band. I play drumset even though I have a band, we just never started. Ok, GanGstA GoO iS OuT, PaYcE
