We struggle beyond it all, and needlessly worry about what we're told is important, but we really have no idea. Yet no one seems to mind. Attachment is inevitably made, yet hard to do, the bond kept, and is seemingly unbroken. Yet, at the point where permanent detachment is utterly inevitable, it seems easier than ever, and no one seems to mind...  Did you forget me already? Of course you did... There might be a special place in your heart for me... but that makes it easier to forget... Omoshiroi desune?  There's no way to cast a net of safety in this situation. It seems, we work so hard, but in the end, does it really matter? No, it does not. In fact, it never matters. No matter how you go about it, or what you do, you will always end up the same, so there's really no point. I could have tried harder, and gotten to exactly where I am, 'cept with a few different numbers here and there, but that's all. And that's not even important.  In fact, what really should be important, doesn't seem to be at all, to anyone else, that is. Close ties formed in "friendship", supposedly necessary for the quality of humanity, but completely ignored when it might be threatened. It seems that that sort of thing is what is most relevant, since everything else determined is determined as such by only trivial matters. Academia means in fact, nothing, and that would be proven if I, of all people, could advace just as much as the next person.  So, it really is all the same, and as such, continuation on that same path is completely indistinct from another, b/c the yeild is the same. And even if its not, what matters will be. What matters is love.  I'm Deadinside, and try to figure that one out.  "Hate your enemies, save your friends, find your place, speak the truth."
