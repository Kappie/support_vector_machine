If a half truth is a lie, it can be implied that  Truth = Lie x 2  Therefore, truth is two times worse than a half truth. It can be concluded that telling half truths is better than telling the full truth.   Excerpt from  A Mathematical Breakdown of Morality , Fay Reese.    Chapter One    The bells of Saint Samuel tolled, ringing over the city below them. The bells told all below that it was now twelve, and the sun told them that it was still daylight. Two rival factions stood facing each other, makeshift weapons in hand, such as oak-handled brooms and butcher knives.  On the east side of the city there stood the Prophets of Change, a party of religious zealots who felt that bloodshed was the only way to move the world on. They are famous for their acts of self-torture.  On the west side stands the Guild of Iron, a party of men and women who devote their lives to the creation of both life and merchant goods. Though they hate death more than Mega Theorin, they are all willing to kill if it means others won’t have to suffer such a fate.  The obvious differences between the two have led to their fight.  Dais, a member of neither, watches through a looking glass, his mortal frame located within an apartment building safe from any blood that will fall this day.  Behind him lies The Book of Half Truths, considered satanic by both the Guild of Iron and the Prophets of Change. Not many can fathom the meanings included within the book, and those who cannot simply put off the book as a juxtaposition of nonsense and garbage, and accuse those who have the knowledge to read it of being liars. This is because those who know the prophecies contained within the book refuse to tell the undeserving.  Dais the Huntsman, who understands Sage Halen’s forecasts, has the book open to the page where the event unfolding outside his window is located. The words read.    And maybe the folly of two,  Two who are many,  Will clash,  Like church bells,  And unleash a bloody hell,  Merry blue!  Chop chop, before all else!    	Often prophecies make little sense, and are written so that they can be applied only after an event has happened. Sage Halen’s divinations are likewise, but unlike other forecasts into the future, they are rarely applicable to anything but one certain event.  	Outside, the killing had begun, and it already looked to be certain death for the Prophets, for the Guild was putting their hammers to good use, bludgeoning countless men and women to death.  Dais couldn’t help but chuckle as a zealot of religion stabbed out a guildsman’s eye with a fork.  And as suddenly as it had begun, it ended. The city watch had come and put an end to it, apparently out of nowhere. Them in their blue uniforms, some now stained faint shades of dark red, had rounded up both parties and marched them off to the city jail, where, no doubt, the battle would continue unless they were put in separate cells.  “Just another day in the city Xesses” Dais said, apparently to himself, but you never knew.
