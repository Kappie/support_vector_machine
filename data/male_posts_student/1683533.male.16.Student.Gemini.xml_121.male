We went on this motion simulator ride for 4 bucks and it sucked.  Also the train wasnt open for the season yet :( I still had alot of fun.  Tomorrow I got no work so I am going to Peking Buffet with her.  There wasnt a band practice at all this break.  My schedule was fucked up cause of work.  Sorry, but I will schedule something next week (talking to bandmembers).  Plus, Marty wasnt home yet.    Work is cool.  It's not hard, and it isnt too bad of an environment.  My nickname is Jerry cause when a guy gets a perm it's called a "Jerry curl"  I told them it was natural, but it stuck.  It's cool, I dont mind.  Some of the other guys have nicknames...well one...his nickname is "Tank"...I actually dont know his real name. And I get free food on my break too.  I got off early today cause it wasnt as busy and I am working Thursday and Friday next week.  I am exhausted from the walking at the zoo and work.  So I am just gonna sit back and listen to some music and take a shower.  Later I might go for a walk.  "Good morning, my rival." -Alucard
