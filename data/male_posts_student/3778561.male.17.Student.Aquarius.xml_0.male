Numbers for the Liberals took an early lead 20 seats here in Atlantic Canada went to the Liberals, 3 to the Conservatives, and 3 to the NDP. I think it was a jolly good show! I am just glad that a Conservative rideing here in ole Newfounldland switched over Liberal! Good job Scott Simms, I was up untill about 1:20 am last night watching the resuts pour in from around the nation. But at 11:54 P.M. NST it was announced that the Liberals would have the minority government then a sigh of releaf come apon me and I was glad! Well  I slep in this morning till 9:30 A.M. that is good for me I am usually up much earlyer! But ahh well that is about all I have to say for now. Until tomorrow!
