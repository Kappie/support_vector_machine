I could see those guys anywhere and just be totally thrilled.  I am starting to run out of steam this week. So much is going on at my bookstore job and my rescue center job that I won't even bore you with all of that. Let me just say that it equals 60+ hours of my time this week. At least I am taking the time and money to see a few good shows; music is good for anyone. Even if it adds to the 'happenings' in my date book, I think it is worth every extra red vein in my eye. School registration is next month and, I am at least stoked on that. I have been spending my free time at home and work reading alot. I finished a few more books; most of them have been good. I actually went to the new library a few days ago and it was really nice. Maybe I will spend more time there, looks fun. I am attempting to write fiction again. Maybe I will just disregard all negative thoughts on my skills and just pour words on to paper. Oh fuck, I really should go to bed, I am creating a sleep deicit that I will not be able to catch up on for a few more days.  Mimi flew to Pheonix today for a business meeting and I am just hanging out in my boxers. word. screw off.   current mood:  distressed current music: The Fire Theft - Uncle Mountain
