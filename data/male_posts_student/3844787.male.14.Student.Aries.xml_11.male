You must understand though, that these short snippits of film do not show the finished work, it is merely a sneak preview of behind the scenes at skarz!  Luke is starting too trust himself more with a skateboard, so now you will start too see better tricks and bigger things, such as high ledges and long sets, hopefully he should be learning to flip some sets pretty soon. We now havesome new skaters on the team, these are James O'Brien and Lee Quirke, we are trying too get as many skaters as possible, we may even be starting a bmx section to the dvd, but we're a bit sceptical as too whether this will go down well.   As you may well know, it is the summer holidays here in the U.K. So we should be getting much more footage, and the DVD will be up for sale before october, the only real problem is, the way we're going to get the postage sorted out, we may even have too set up a PO BOX or something, but that costs, so i might be setting up a paypal account, all donations are welcome and needed!   If you have any suggestions or comments post it in the comments area in here! Thankyou!   Signed, Luke
