There was a day way back in may, oh soo long ago ;). You were bored, and we were in our talking phase. You told me to come up, and I of course wanted to so I did. When I got there, we had our fun little LOTR trivia dealio, cause we are both dorks like that, but I love it. Then we went for a walk in dark hollow. Just a nice simple, fun, walk. The world faded away behind us, and it was just you and me. You found out I was nervous about you, and I still am just fyi, but that also meant I could open up to you. Then on the way home built up my courage and got to hold your hand. Such a lil accomplishment in todays sex minded world, but it meant a lot to me. And they lived happily ever after is the ending to that lil part. Cause it is is true, been happy ever after that, and I hope you have been too, deep down inside, where it counts. I know there has been a lot of shit going on, but I hope on top of everything, where it really counts, you are still happy. Thats what matters :-*  Now for part two of this. I dunno how much I will be able to talk to you till u get home, so I wanna explain this here so I can save those minutes that cost you so much. I was talking to Heidi today about how nervous I am that your coming home. I want you home, yeah, but I love being with you and don't want to screw it up. I really have put so much "into" this month, and I just don't want things to fall apart once your home. So I am asking you to do me a favor. If I get too "in your face" or overbearing or pushy or anything, just tell me to back off. I know you are going to need some space once you get home, and I am not the only person in your life and there are plenty of other people you are going to want to see. So just tell me if I am getting annoying before it makes you or me snap or anything. On the same token, I don't wanna distance myself or anything too. I know this all sounds weird, but me and heidi decided it made sense, so there, lol. I'm just not used to actually having you be here when I want to be with you, so things are going to be odd. But y'know what, that is us, i dunno what we would do if things were normal.  Now I am sorry there is so much to read on here. It is all weird since its out of order too, but oh well. I hope the rest of your trip is as good as possible. Hope the pool went well and no one freaked out or got mad. I smashed my hand today and my finger is swollen and my back is all sore, so it was a good day, nothing too bad ;) hehe. I love you.
