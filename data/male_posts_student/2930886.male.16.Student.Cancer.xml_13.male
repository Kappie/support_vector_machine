I think that scares me a lot, I am scared to fail at life I don't want to become just another brick in the wall, I want to be an individual just someone who is the best at what they do and enjoys what they do. But lets look back on the year that was my sophomore year in high school. This year I had a not bad schedule, it wasn't too hard or too easy just right. English was my first period class and I already commented on it in a previous post. Business law was my second class and I also posted on that last week sometime. My third period class was Gym/Study Hall. First of all I am amazed that some of these people have been able to live 15 years of their lives in this world without being shot for being so stupid. Especially those want to be thugs/pimps who are just dumb pieces of shit who will end up in jail or working at one of the local retail stores like Walmart. Gym wasn't that bad this year, had some fun meet some new people, some hot click in my class, which I was lucky and I sure would have banged Mollis in a heartbeat. Well fourth period was with Miss Brooks. I mean people made her out to be much worse than she was, she wasn't that bad. People we only got homework once a week a test every couple of months, it was easy, so what she gave us a shitload of stuff to do at the end of the year. We were better prepared for the final than Mr Priohs classes. Even though she is big fat and black and from the south I mean really I don't have anything against her like Dan does. Dan is the biggest racist I know. Fifth period with Mr Yaffe was probably one of the best classes I have had in a while. It was fun playing jeopardy but we also learned some cool shit that actually may help us in life. Jeopardy was fun with Mr Yaffe and if ever need help making some sort of powerpoint or something I know who I will go to. Period six was French 3 with Mrs. Bontemps. I mean people made her class out a lot harder than it was; and at time it may have been harder but I don't know I enjoyed this year we had some fun times just sitting around talking even though people who don't participate or anything get better grades than me I still know I smarter than them. It was fun and she is leaving for a year, I don't now why she is a good teacher and I don't want to have to put up with a new French teacher for a year then hopefully have Mrs. Bontemps come back. Come on people so what she didn't curve, we all passed and no one at Stratford High did; and their teacher wrote the test. Period seven was with Mrs. Pappano who was one of the best teachers ever, she is fun and she actually teaches the stuff not like some teachers who don't do anything at all with their classes. I think I learned more in 1 week in her class that I did in all of Mr Smiths class. I hope that I get her in the future for some math class or a study hall because she is a good teacher and fun too. Polish which was another class I took wasn't bad, it was at Yale once a week. Even though it conflicted with my schedule for track I didn't mind, because there was some fine ass there. Fun I learned a lot especially Brunos bakery in New York City, which had some of the best desserts I have had. And I saw Times Square which is over rated but it was cool.
