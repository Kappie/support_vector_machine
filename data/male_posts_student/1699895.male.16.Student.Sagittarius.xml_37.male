Yeah, Im grounded till spring break =( but at least im not grounded during spring break. That would be f'd up. To make a long story short, I did something wrong.  Well, not too much going on other then that. Today was just a tiring day i guess.  Got home and started homework since I had so much, and im still not done, so I should probobly finish it.  Wings lost 4-1? Tigers won 7-0? WTF?!  ttyl
