Don't get me wrong, high school is fun and I like it and it's almost definitely easier, but it just feels like everything we do now is for the future. Tests, grades, sports, clubs, service...we don't do anything for the sake of doing it anymore, which is why I want college because all those obligations would finally be over (though there will be new ones like money and units, but whatever). That is why junior high was so good, because we still had no worries and we were old enough to enjoy it. But back in Thornton I didn't know 99% of you guys (cuz roughly .01% of Thornton graduates are in honors classes [Erik, represent! and Alex...kinda]), so I'm glad for high school because I know all you guys. And there's where we reach a pleasant little Catch-22: the more successful we are in high school and the better the college we are admitted into, the fewer of people we know who will be with us. Maybe we could all just turn stupid and go to Ohlone together :-D But that won't happen, and this inexorable parting of the ways is the bittersweetness of growing up. No, I'm mostly fine with it. I just wish I had more control over things.  The CAHSEE was OK, no big deal...I needlessly wasted a bunch of fancy words in my essay like amalgation, obfuscate, and rhetoric. Silly me. It was fun with Jason while taking the test, though he continually insists on making passes at me...uh, don't ask. Lunch, we haven't had any tournament games in a few days. Claire (who is also now officially one of The Guys) had a very sharp scarf on. Alex whispered some joke about it to Jason, but sadly I'm not Daredevil so I couldn't hear. I got locked out of the gym in PE. Yes, that's pretty sad.   Track was damn hard, friggin'...a million squats and lunges, then a million more squats and lunges, then frog-hops, then a million more...you get the picture. (Weirdly enough, the freshmen aren't that bad. Which kind of contradicts the definition of freshmen, but oh well. Can't believe we were once like them...) I live for after practice though...just hanging out with the hurdlers and badminton people and feeling that endorphin-induced post-exercise satisfaction. I like my spikes. They're cozy and they remind me of...ballet shoes? Except...blue and black Nike ballet shoes...with spikes!   Belinda dragged me into the girls' locker room against my will...nothing happened, nobody's privacy was violated or anything weird like that...I was expecting a lot more, but all they had were a bunch of really old and tall tall lockers. None of that rumored stank though. Whew. Still, it was...an experience not to be forgotten. Life-changing stuff, you know. There is no secret of the universe more sought after than...seeing the girls' locker room. Oh yeah. People like Erik think the secret of the universe is really donuts. That's a common misconception though, completely understandable. Pat was dying of lack of oxygen intake in the gym so he came outside to talk with me about science teachers with bad African accents who can't count and scare people after they run into poles. Then Alex and James and I talked about how oranges and stress cause pimples. Abdullah wrote "Jattman" on Tina's essay...yes, Simran's influence permeates everything. Then Alex and I walked home, and talked about something like...snapping off noses. Mhm.  On a completely unrelated tack, I sometimes feel the more people know me, the less they like me...or maybe it's just me...I don't know...
