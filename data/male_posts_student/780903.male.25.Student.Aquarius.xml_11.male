If I do my laundry now, by Monday I'll have 3 pairs of socks that are dirty, 3 pairs of boxers, a couple of t-shirts, and maybe a pair of shorts that will all need laundry again.  And there's nothing less fun than getting to a new place and already having laundry to do.  But if I wait until Sunday, I'll have a hundred other things to do -- like alphabetize my CDs, test my pens to see if they're out of ink, and sort through random piles of paper looking for the ones I'll need to start a new random pile of papers in my dorm room -- and won't want to do laundry.  And then I'll end up going up there with no clean clothes.  Which is stupid.  So I guess I should do laundry now.  Or tonight, after I take my socks off.  Or now, but take off my socks.  And if I go anywhere, not wear socks.  Or wear socks with holes in them that I don't want to take with me anyway.  See the dilemma??
