Or the other girl who will remain unnamed who is a friend of a friend of mine. I miss having a reason to go out, and I miss having someone to spend the night with. I haven't woken up beside someone and felt happy for quite a while now. I don't really miss the girl that much anymore, but i surely miss the feeling.  Guh. Search for a roomate is slow and unproductive.   the two of you. the two i've always loved but could never have. the notes are in the drawer. will never be the same
