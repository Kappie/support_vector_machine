Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Accidentally in Love -Counting Crows  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #43  It seems almost a fairy tale that eleven years after their emergence the Counting Crows have finally written their best single ever, easily trumping past attempts to breed rock/pop with jangle poetry. Maybe more a demented fairy tale (not unlike the  Shrek 2  film that it plays the theme to), the song is called “Accidentally in Love,” a feel-good pop romantic with folly for lyrics and the occasional racy double-meaning that we knew  Adam Duritz  (vocalist) just couldn’t leave behind (prime example: “Just get yourself inside her”).  Durtiz’s  snaky verses spiced with bouncing call-backs speed into an all-or-nothing chorus that serenades with one of the finest come-ons in musical love history (um, well, “Come on, come on!”). I guess what makes the song, aside from chugging electric-acoustic chords, is  Adam’s  tenderness, a quality he has previously hidden (past lyric: “We spend all day getting’ sober"). Remember when  Enrique Iglesias  paraded around assuring that “you can’t escape [his] love,” all the while making like  Schwarzenegger  and leaving little of  Anna Kournikova’s  body untouched?  Duritz  counters that brilliantly by telling his opposite that there’s “no escaping [her] love.” He’s the one who deserves to be touched (and we've all been waiting for that summer anthem that makes us want to feel Adam Duritz).   The Verdict:  9.1/10 - The Fork   (4.55/5)     2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry
