I was late coming back from lunch today. I just went home by myself for a change. I usually go with Josh and Alyssa, but today for some reason I decided to go home. At home I warmed up some left over pizza from the other night. I went through and burned some of the songs I downloaded last night. I like 80s, so they were all 80's songs. Anyways they didn't say much about being late. It was somebody else in the office.   Well Wednesday I got to job shadow at the police department. It was great. I got to spend all morning there! When I first got there, we sat down and talked. It was great because they had 2 boxes of donuts to eat. So we talked about police, what he liked and didn't like. His name was sergeant Thornsberry. He was great. He has a very good sense of humor, but knows when too much is too much. After that he gave me a tour of the station. It isn't that big of a station, but still it was fun. Then I sat down and talked to the chief for about a half hour. He was great too. I talked to him about there different types of calls and there salaries. Then sergeant Thornsberry came back and I went with him to go out patrolling. It is like a dream come true to go out patrolling in a police car. We stopped all over and got to pull someone over for speeding. He showed me everything about the car, like what's in the trunk, the radios, camera, and the radar gun. I had some much fun with him. Later on he got called back to station to do something more important, so I went driving around with another officer named Gary James. He was a very neat officer too. We went around some more patrolling. While we were out, I asked them if there was any laws against people following cops using scanners. He said "We might be able to pull something out. Why? Have you been doing it? You don't drive a little red car do you?" Ha, I about shit my self, because I do drive a little red Mercury Tracer. It was so funny. He just started laughing and saying how he seen my like 4 times last Saturday night and stuff. I just thought that was really funny how they know what my car looks like. But they would have to because I follow them all the time.  Well I gotta get going. Its time for me to patrol the school hallways. Until we meet again, eric
