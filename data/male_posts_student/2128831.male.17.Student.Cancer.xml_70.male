This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to a verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephemeral, in transit? In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.    How am I to react to this slander?  Well, life and fate shall sentence the ignorant and the fools.  Will I delete them?  No.  Will I let them stand? Yes. To these  rapscallion or for their stupid asses sake a rascal, ne'er-do-well peice of shit individauls it seems to me if they have any balls or a dick for that matter that a message with some identifing factor would have been placed.  But alas these dickless, spineless subhumaniod developmental rejects don't have the gonads that it takes.  *smiles* Yes, Fabi and I will fuck eachother and gladly go to Hell for it. Better than any sex you will ever get I assure you.  *smiles* Baby, I heart you massively! P.S.- to these individual look on the comments for Friday March 19th, 2004 Fabi wrote in response to you, and all other readers indulge yourself in my boi's writing... And on a final note to whom it is be careful, very fucking careful.  YOU FUCK WITH A FLAMER AND YOU ARE GONNA GET YOUR ASS BURNED!   Long time, okay like 3 days… I had to prove that it didn’t own me… I was worried but see below!  Mrhahahahahahahahah! It don’t!       18.75 %          My weblog owns 18.75 % of me.  urlLink Does your weblog own you?   As for thinks that might … writing and Fabi.  He is the bomb shite, yo!  It is so amazing to have an attractive, gorgeous sweet, kind, smart, caring, sensitive, mature (did I mention hott?) boi to cradle in my arms and to be able to love him as much as he loves me.  It is tres spiffy!    Ask me how long will I love you? Will I love you forever? No, I won’t. Will I love you for as long as the sun shines? No, I won’t. Will I love you for as long as time permits? No, I won’t. But, I will love you... Until the day you stop loving me. Or will I love you, until the day you stop loving me? NO. I will still love you... Even after you've stopped loving me.   I am very touched for what you have said to me, It worth more than a million. I am appreciative to what you have done, I do not know what good can I give in return. I try to protect you but if I do that,  It may do you more harm than good. I remain silent. Your words hold so much resonance for me, They are all in a book and I cherish it like a bible. The journey is uncharted, but I want run to the long, winding road laid with rubble. I know you will support me through with confidence. And the resonance my heart, The calling out towards you I know not where I am  Or where I shall being going But I will do it by your side My promise for always   I don't hate anyone. Maybe sometimes I wish I did, but I don't. The impulse is to follow this statement up with: "except... [and make jokes about people who do annoying little things I don't understand]." But, the truth is, I don't hate anyone. Temporarily, I get frustrated with lots of people, sure. But, how do you hate anyone at all, if you know "where it's at," to use a lame phrase? I mean, really?! Do you know where "it's at?"  Have you realized in your darkest hour that you need something, some kind of help, some kind of drug or whatever to get you "normal" again? Because, whatever it is that you feel, you just don't "feel" NORMAL! You can lay in bed for an entire day or a week and you feel like a disaster because you just can't MAKE YOURSELF do the things you have to do. Or, you just need something to get you "jazzed" about living again (i.e. fucked up)? It's all, your life, a series of barely-controllable circumstances you were born into which are YOUR responsibility to learn how to CONTROL in a way that you see fit AND in a way that society sees fit. It doesn't matter if your father was a drunk rapist who ended up in jail or that your mom tried to have sex with your best friend once when she caught you and your buddies sneaking a drink from the liquor cabinet... or that you were taunted and beaten mercilessly throughout your high school years. None of this matters. Your job is to make the best of it and not to implode or explode, but to simply FIT IN. In the 1950's they wrote actual self-help books which were GEARED toward teaching people how to be a "cog in the machine" (YES they actually used that phrase! At that point in time, the industrial revolution was seen as a brilliant evolutionary step!)   It's true, you don't remember making a conscious decision to live on this planet; you just popped out of the void into this life. But, still, not being prepared is no excuse. You're here. Deal with it.  If life goes you cherries then make pie.  And if you get a shit load of them well, there is cobbler  Perhaps you were born a minority in the good ol' USA. Tough titty for you that it's going to be just that much harder to achieve your goals. Maybe you have a chemical imbalance that most people just don't understand (which is funny, if you think about it, because just about everyone is chemically imbalanced). You might start taking a pill out of desperation that really starts putting everything into "focus." At this point, you're shocked. You wonder: "Who am I? I seem to be dependent on a chemical reaction... this little pill makes seemingly insignificant chemical changes in my brain that makes everything about my personality that I had previously known and loved as 'myself' (to whatever extent possible as a self-hating, confused, depressed creature) completely DIFFERENT and more "normal" and BETTER!... Suddenly everything is just... hard to explain... but, everything is different. I'm a different person, I'm a person much closer to what I've always wanted to be!"  And what happens when it's time to ease off the chemical? Who are you then? Who are you when some "authority" switches you to a new chemical as a replacement?  Well, it would seem that you're fucked. What are you? You're not your memories and you're not your thoughts. The chemicals have proven that: with new chemicals, all your old memories seem false, all your thoughts are different. Everything is different... and yet, there you are... still in your skull, watching the world unfold. But, are you actually prepared to say you are nothing more than chemicals? This makes all thoughts secondary: Bach and Mozart weren't creating brilliant music; just the fecal outporings of chemical reactions! Was Einstein a genius? Of course he was!
