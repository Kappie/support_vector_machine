How mooful is that? Very! Quack Quack Quack.  After HZGG and lunch, I had plans to play my FFX. However, I was quite held up donwloading songs and replying to forums, so meow for me. HaHa. I finally got Sugababes' Too Lost In You from Kent Kent! After so many meows at downloading, I finally got it! Thanks Kent Kent. She gave me other mp3s too, all of them very nice! :)          Around 3, I switched off my computer to go play my FFX. Alas, my mother was busy with the taxes, so I laid on my mother's bed. Yeah. You should know the story. I fell asleep! Heh Heh. I slept and slept till 5, when I almost rolled down the bed. That meowing brother didn't wake me up!   Hmm..I watched a bit of Unbeatables, then reluctantly (and tiredly) went down to buy dinner. As usual, my brother ate the yu pian tang and I ate fried rice. Even ducks meow! After eating, watching TV and bathing, I came online.   MNI is kinda crazy today. When it can go fast, the pages load quick. When it goes slow (it does on a whim), it can go REALLY slow. Geez. Anyway, on the Mature Discussion (Politics/Philosophy) forum, there's a certain immature idiot running around. She's a young girl, a Christian Republican. I have never seen such a stupid, narrow-minded person such as herself. First of all, she, like over-zealous Xians, think that Christianity is the best religion all around, and bash people for not being Christian (she said to a wiccan: "you better rethink your life, your afterlife isn't gonna be pretty", which means the wiccan will rot in hell. Being a Wiccan, I was personally offended. I did not butt in, because that's not my place to). Secondly, she is the sterotypical Republican. She agrees with Bush, whatever he said, simply because she agrees with him. She sticks to the Bible, for which she believes that is the true word of God. Honestly! She reminds me of Bush, that fat idiot. Whenever someone agrees with her, she goes all happy. When someone disagrees and puts a well-said argument, she will whine about being attacked. Everyone has been telling her that, but she still goes on attacking all the same. Sigh. I wanted to contribute my two cents, but I'm afraid it would come out heated, and have galleosn docked off me. So nah. Let Cindel deal with her.  Oh well. I think I end this blog le. Meow meow meow, meow meow. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
