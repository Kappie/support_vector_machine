Dono y his freq always diff from me one lor… when smt tok things he sure hav things to say, n when ague he would always say tt I am right and he is always wrong… lame right?? 4 example, when I told one of my fren tt I had a Christian name n he overheared it, he said do u noe wad Christian name r for??? As if I dono like tt. bUt Of coz I noe lar, my this name is my ah-ma n other family members giv one, n they noe the meanings of it n they told me b4. n so does he means tt I dono wad it means????? Arrrrhh. Basically I felt tt he juz think he noe much more things lar, which is e truth. But he don hav to project a image which make pple feel tt he himself don.. N also somewhere las yr, a news article abt e commandos unit was disqualified from best unit comp, n when he mentioned abt this to me n my frenz, I continued conversation. N guess wad?? He said tt ‘as if I noe liddat’. Wad the f is this man.  Haiz, lets 4get abt the sad part.
