Back when I was a child before life removed all the innocence, I wanted to be a superhero so that I could save the world from all sorts of evil. But then later, as I grew up, I became more realistic and I narrowed my choices. The jobs that came to mind were doctor, engineer, and lawyer among others. Why these jobs, you may ask? The answer is simple. It pays big money when you have these jobs.  That aside, never in a million years would I have imagined that I would want to become a radio deejay but to tell you the truth, up to now, I still fantasize on becoming a superhero like Superman so that I can have X-ray vision. Seriously though, when choosing an ambition, I believe that one has to be realistic that he or she can be able to achieve his “dreams.”  So do I believe that I can become a radio deejay? My answer is yes and I am not being cavalier when saying that.  Up to this day I still ask myself the same question,” Why do I want to become a radio deejay?” and up to now, I am still clueless. I think that the main reason behind my desire to become a radio deejay is because of my liking to talk. It can even be said that my hobby is talking. Sometimes during my spare time, I would even talk to the bottle in front of me just for fun although nothing would beat human companionship. I just love to talk and I believe that I can talk on virtually anything and everything to anyone and everyone.  Another thing is that I love entertaining people. To me, nothing can beat the satisfaction on having to know that I have made the worst day of a person’s life and transformed it into the best day of his or her life. When I crack a joke and when I see the smiles and laughter lit on the faces of closed friends and loved ones, it just gives me a glint of satisfaction. So imagine how would I feel if I was able to entertain millions of people all over Malaysia if not the whole world.  I would like to share with you my personal experiences just to tell you roughly how I would feel. Right now, I am currently SMSing someone that I speak fondly of and sometimes I would crack a joke or two. I would wait anxiously for her reply and when I get one and  I see the message reading, ‘That’s so funny.’ or something like that, I would be on “Cloud Nine.” I would imagine her holding her Nokia phone, smiling at the silly joke that I had just made with her back on her couch and biting her tender lips while giving me a reply. I am sure that everyone has had that feeling before and multiply that exact same feeling by a thousand and the answer won’t be close to what I would feel.  One quality that a good radio deejay must possess is the ability to gain the attention of the people. A radio deejay is “talking” to millions of people and he must be able to gain their attention and if he or she can’t do that, then it means that “he” isn’t a good deejay. When holding an event, and you see several thousands of people looking up at you in awe and listening intently to whatever gibberish you have to say, it just boosts your confidence and it urges you to do more of that. That happens to radio deejays on occasions when they become “emcees” for a certain event but that is also similar to what happens when you are speaking on the microphone on one end and having twenty-five million people listening on the other end. One most not deny that whenever he or she wants to be in the entertainment industry, it is also because of fame. Sadly, that mostly happens in the west and we are in the east. In countries like America or Britain, if you were to be a well-known personality walking in the street trying to lead an average life, people from all corners will be streaming towards you wanting a “piece” of you. In Malaysia, people will know your name and say “hi” whenever they meet you, but that is the most. Although, you do get free merchandise and celebrity endorsements courtesy of your new-found fame and it is easier to mingle with the opposite sex if you are famous.  The pay of a radio deejay is respectable but if you are expecting a fat paycheck, I advise you to take a “rain check” and choose another career that would suit your wallet size. But as for me, I want to embark on my course to become a well-known radio deejay in the mould of Ryan Seacrest and Rick Dees.
