Everyone is in such a hurry. I've seen women putting their make-up on while driving in traffic, I mean come on!!! One bump and bam... there goes her eye. But it doesn't seen to matter to these people how dangerous or fruitless these things can be, they are compelled to shave a second off here and there in some great rush. But what are they rushing to? What's the big frickn' hurry?  I think the ultimate example of this stupidity is the cell phone. Now, let me just say that some people (doctors, etc.) really need these things. But is everybody so starved for time that they can't call somebody from home or the office? Or, God forbid, stop over and talk to someone in person. Is their brain going to explode if they have a couple moments of silence? Its insane.  It seems like nobody reads books anymore, they take up too much time. So they miss out on great ideas and stories so they can watch another reality show. They can't stop and read a newspaper or journal, nope too busy for that. So they only hear a 10 second news clip when its interrupting their favorite radio station. So we have a lot of ignorant people waking around that only believe what they're told because they don't have time to form their own opinion.  What ever happened to "stopping and smelling the roses"? We need to make sure that in our constant rush towards... whatever... that we don't miss important things in life and in the process fail to appreciate what we already have.
