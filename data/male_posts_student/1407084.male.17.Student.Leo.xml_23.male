But by the time we had to perform, as usual at  band functions, we were all pumped and ready for some field showage.  We performed our field show, and it was great. We waited patiently through all the other bands to find out how we did, and boy was it worth the wait. WE BEAT SOMEONE! I really couldn't believe this when they announce that we had a second place trophy. It was nice.  Anyways... other than that.. I had some good fun times with a couple old friends that I haven't done anything with for a while. It made me feel good.. they think I am funny, for some reason. I suggest you all go leave your little cliques behind for a day and go spend some time with friends you wouldn't normally hang out with. It's worth it, believe me.  Lately, everybody seems to be clinging on to all their friends like they are all going to dissapear tomorrow. I don't see why it is so hard to reach new people for some of these friends. Should I call them friends? One person that I know is very friendly, but won't ever invite me to any youthly gatherings that they host because they don't know me well enough. I have invited them to mine, and they come, and I get no compensation. I don't mean to sound greedy, but this seems to be happenening a lot with more people than just that one friend. I just wish that the people I know that invite all my friends to do stuff with them, whether it be parties, movies, bowling, or even freakin' going to pick up some burgers at mcdonalds just invite me to also participate. I could have parties all the time, but at this point it feels to me that if nobody else ever invites me, why should I invite them, or ever have them at all?   OK new topic. Skiing. 1..2..3 go I want to ski. It's been like a year since we've been able to hit the slopes. Every time I walk into my room, I get depressed because I see my skis just lying there all lonesome and unused. Sigh...  Well, I'm tired of writing this, so I am going to go play counter-strike, which is what I do when I'm not invited to things. Bye.
