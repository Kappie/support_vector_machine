I mean, the program was almost dead a few years ago, and to start over again with a classload of freshmen(who, by the way, did manage to get their act together) and play the way we did was phenomenal. Even better, our director basically gave me a solo bow after the 2nd and 3rd pieces (logical I guess, I had the melody and no trumpet section to back me up), and the audience ate it right up. I got some very generous applause. Best of all, Martha was sitting in the 2nd row and saved me a seat :) So after the band had rocked the hizzouse, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the rest of the fabulous concert together. Her host family left her behind after the concert was over, which was kinda sad, considering she's been there for the whole year. But I got to stay and talk to her for an extra half hour, which was awesome of course. Hehe, as you can tell, my ego is soaring. Life is good. Unfortunately, I can count on my AP and math exams to chew up the next week and spit it out. Well, after that it's Christmas, but no Martha... I'd better enjoy these last days as much as possible :)   So much has changed since I made that post five months ago, and yet I find myself in the exact same position. Today was the last day of school for the seniors, and I have to admit it totally caught my dazed sinus-infected self by surprise. I wanted to say goodbye to everyone that I could, even though I'm going to graduation. I just get the feeling that I'll never see some of them again. Whelp, it's time to start getting ready for Bravo. Wish me luck.
