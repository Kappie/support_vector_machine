On Saturday morning, I went bright and early (10:00 am) to the Junior Bridges meeting, where we did relatively nothing for three hours but repeat our summer experiences indoors. Afterwards, Elise and I joined each other with Whitney A., one of her friends, Laura (companion of Elise), and Nisha at the not-so-nearby McAlister's, and we all had lunch. Elise made me (she really did make me) eat a pickle, and, like I maintain, it was disgusting. I washed it down with cheesecake. Elise hit me several times for being ridiculous. She makes me so very happy.  Then I went home and killed myself with car wax.  That evening, I drove to Alanna's house, for we were planning to see Big Fish. (Brock drove his bloody nice car to her house.) Brock was there, and so was Morgan, and so was Laylee, but Laylee couldn't go to the movie (goddamn regulations). Laylee and Alanna were showering when I arrived, so I watched and listened to Alanna's computer with Brock and Morgan. Alanna asked me to call Brock wordy-durds for her, so I complied: "YOU FUCKING CUNT! WHY ARE YOU SUCH AN ASSHOLE?" I apologized to Brock.  Big Fish was sold out. We rented A Life Less Ordinary instead, and watched it at Brock's house. Morgan had me scream "Get your hands off of my woman, muthafucka!" in the car on the way there. And Wesley definately thinks I am not human. So fun.  I wrote this of late, and was encouraged to post it:   Your back is bent against the side of the mattress Head, thrown back to touch the frame And your eyes, closed As the blood rushes to your ears And feeling that peaceful euphoria on ultimate Calm, in one spot One single place in the universe Where everything is correct, for one hour One hand flung carelessly to lay on the floor The fingers slightly curled And the other in my palm, for me to hold As I peer over the mattress edge At your eyelids, and half-open lips Lightly laying one hand on your naked stomach For the sake of feeling flesh And muscle and tissue, pulsing For the sake of inhaling your exhale For the caress against skin, produces a dizzying Carbon-dioxide-inhaling sensation, like I can’t breathe And I drink my own dopamine That tells my body, you are attracted to The body that hangs over the edge of the bed Even if it isn’t for sex or marriage or legality It’s a natural love potion And I want to roll over and sigh Writing on her stomach in Sharpie:  The scents of your natural perfume And my sense of compassion for you When your back is bent And your heart inhaling The quiet lullaby of your breath Weaves the dream over my eyes And allows me to sleep more deeply.   Cheers, mortals. Have a nice evening.
