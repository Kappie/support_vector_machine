I usually laugh to lighten the situation, so that it isn't so ghastly serious all the time, but today I found out sometimes, it has to be serious, you can't just turn everything into a joke, you must be sincere at some points in your life. In fact the thing that I would change in my personality (and I've always wanted this) is to be able to take things seriously, it's too not laugh or try and make jokes when something is serious, it sad. Also another is the ability to trust people, but that's another story. The Protagonist is out.
