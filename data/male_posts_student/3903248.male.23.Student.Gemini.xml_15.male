Let's look at it this way.  Nog will obviously have the tougher first fight.  I'm looking for Fedor to end Ogawa's existence in roughly 2 minutes, give or take.  Sergei is a very decent fighter and I think he will give Nog a hard fight if he can stay away from the "Top Team Special."  Unless Nog can finish Sergei quickly, regardless of his stamina, he is going to be somewhat gassed by the time the final match rolls around.  If I had to pick it.....  Nah, I can't do it.  It's too close.  As for the other matches:  Randleman over Waterman  Silva over Kondo  Aleksander over Mirko....  Yeah, I said it, WHAT!?!?!  If I'm wrong on any of my picks, I'll accept that.  We'll see on the 22nd.
