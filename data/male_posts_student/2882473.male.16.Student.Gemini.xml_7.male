I shall now do a post in the style of his grumpy ramblings:  I think I'll start with Cocacola, as I would think you all know, is a company/corporation (see nonnesuch's blog for the difference). I would just like to say how evil I think they are, firstly by their adverts on tv. In UK, their most recent advert shows a woman singing some sort of song, and handing out free bottles of their well known drink. I hate this because the song being sung sounds vaguely religious, like the ones you would hear in a modern church choir. Linking their product to religion, drawing their evil influence on possibly good-hearted people arghhhh!! Also, handing out free bottles, corrupting the minds of people, giving the impression that it is good value.... It almost had me convinced, but I soon realised what they were trying to do. Secondly the appearence of bins at school, with the CocaCola label on them, is terrible. How evil is that!?!? Advertising to young people in the school... it's not even a healthy drink, which leads me on to my next point: The drink is awful, costing possibly less than tenth of the price to make as they sell it at. All it is is water and flavourings with a bit of CO2 bubbled though it. It's terribly bad for your health too, dissolving teeth..., increasing the acidity of the stomach, dehydrating you. Why do people keep drinking this filth, it's horrible.  SAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU STILL CAN!  Well, that's today's little moan out the way.
