I stayed up all last night and my friend Adam (aka Buffon) came over at about 2.00am. We kept ourselves amused by playing low-budget online games and watching videos of skateboarding bails. Time soon passed and we finally got to 4.30am. We left for Styal Country Park with camera in hand. I took tons of pictures and I'm really proud of them all. View them at  urlLink www.flickr.com/photos/slow_chemical . It was a bit of a hard thing to do to stay awake all night just to make sure you leave the house on time.  I was exhausted by the time we left, which was at about 9.00am. I still am! And all day it has felt like we are 5 hours ahead of time. We got home at around 10.00am and barely had time to have a bit of a rest because I had to go out again. Adam and I had been invited to go to Laser Quest! It's so cool. Incase you don't know what it is, it's like a real-life Unreal Tournament, but with lasers. Everyone gets a target-pack attached to them and a laser gun. The aim is to run around the terrain, avoiding shots from other players, and to shoot as many people as you can. We had two twenty minute sessions. The first time I didn't have a clue what was going on, and I barely shot anyone because I didn't know we weren't playing in teams! So I only come 15th out of 18 players that time. But I learned from my mistake the second time around, shifting my score output to 3rd! Buffon and I worked together a lot in kicking mucho asso. It was so cool, I really enjoyed it!  Then I went to meet Mandy in town. I didn't know if this was a good idea or not at first. Things seemed really weird between us. But in the end, I ended up giving in to her and giving it one more final chance. And I do mean it when I say final chance. It's not that I don't want it, because I do. It's just that I'm still unsure if it will work. But it's down to Mandy to prove if it will or not. Anyway... she was being extremely loving! And I was being extremely dopey because I was, and am, knackered. I am still half-expecting that things will change back to how they used to be, and it's scary. But still, it's amazing now like it always should be, so I'm gonna enjoy it while I can.  Whilst in town, I went into Music Zone to buy a Fear Factory CD. I had to choose out of 2 CD's, so I asked Mandy her opinion. And what an opinion. She ended up offering to pay for the CD I didn't choose which was really nice of her! But she's a sneaky one. I was queing behind her to pay for the other CD, when she grabbed it from my hand and payed for that one too! So she payed for both of the CD's I wanted! I told her not to, constantly! But she wouldn't listen. How nice of her! So with the money I was planning to use on a CD, I wanted to buy Mandy something with instead, but still she refused. So I bought a DVD instead - Donnie Darko. I have heard lots of good things about this movie so I will watch it sometime soon.  Anyway. I am exhausted. I can guarentee I will be asleep within one minutes time.
