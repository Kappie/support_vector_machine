I'm gonna find some Baha'i quote that I want to remember for the day.... and then get something from the Bible, and just publish the entry.  Never click links when you have something important open.... damn.  Alright, a Quote from "Divine Philosophy". Today the enmity and rivalry existing between the religions are over mere words. It is an established fact that the followers of all the religions believe in a reality, the benefits of which are universal; which reality is a medium between God and man. The Jews call that reality Moses, the Christians Christ, the Mussulmans Mohammed, the Buddhists Buddha and the Zoroastrians  156  Zoroaster. Now mark well that none of these religionists have ever seen the founders; they have only heard his name. Could they overlook these names they would at once realize that all believe in a perfect reality which is an intermediary between the Almighty and the creatures.  	(Abdu'l-Baha, Divine Philosophy, p. 155)  Okay, that's done.  Now a proverb from a book of the same name.  I guess God let this one stand out to me, because I didn't really take time to understand this ones meaning, but I felt I should post it.  9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.  	(King James Bible, Proverbs)  I'm officially a philosophical fanatic.  I really don't have much of a life, I'm all talk....
