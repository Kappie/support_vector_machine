One example is Radzi(my friend)he got steadywith (2) only for about twoweeks. (1) is the only girl i thought of living my whole life with. Imagine--> me married to (2) then a few month later we get divorced. What the F. who would take care of my children(if have one lah..). People who get divorce... hai..is..is...cant stand them. So i take a few days more to think of this.
