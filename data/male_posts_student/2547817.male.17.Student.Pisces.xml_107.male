Angeline's got a high fever and I'm very worried for her. Family went to this restaurant for lunch and were treated like V.I.P.'s after which a crazy cook lady came to me and said she was having cookies for lunch. She walked away, then came back and said "excuse me, coffee too". I smiled.  Took a nap on my bed for the first time since then. Pillow was musty smelling. We used to talk on the bed. It's sacred ground.  Just spoke with previous entry's "she". It's sad coz the girls who I'd expect to be able to handle it -can't. I'm numbed again. Just like a political aftermath. It's good in a way, coz I become un-feeling, to hurt at least. She tells me that I'm not the first good friend to do this. Gee... then I wonder who it falls to then. Deja-vu. Then again, boys are dumbasses, so it's always our fault. I'm going to leave her be, and pray. Pray that God works in her life. She is capable of big things. I'm not going to stop caring, or forget this, and her, and what she's done in my life. At very least, I'll have a few very good memories of a very good friend. At this, a farewell salute to you, very good friend. I can only hope, that what you believe currently, fades to new light in time. Love you and take care.  A new day and perhaps a new Dawn.
