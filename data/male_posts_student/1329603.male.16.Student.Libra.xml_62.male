Jon, England - I'm a free speech fanatic and I make no bones in saying that I believe the right of this person to exercise his freedoms is justified. However, I am fully against prejudice of any sort. It must be made clear, at this point, however, that if this person has been brought up and has this prejudice it is not possible to condemn him for saying what he believes. It is only possible to condemn his upbringing and beliefs to date. My message is this: we must, instead of aiming at those who fight race through words and acts, aim at those who persuade the young that those different to us are 'wrong'. In this way, we will filter out racism at a greater rate than what we are doing at the moment. I must point out that no-one seems to have made the point that millions are dying in the world as we send this email amongst ourselves. What is a greater problem? Some poorly-raised individual who wants to share his views, or the fact that millions across the world live in poverty and death? That in some countries, this man would be killed for saying what he believes, if it goes against the system? Believe me, I consider racism to be a problem. But we must accept the fact that there are bigger problems that no-one seems to give a damn about.  And here we are, the last night of Pirates is finished, dead, gone. Sally didn't let me hug her... waaaah.. Rachel did though, she was happy when I did ^^. She's cool. But Sally is also cool.... Waaah.  Rhiannon couldn't come. Shame, but not life-threatening, I'll see her at some point.  All of our cool sixth formers (apart from Rachel and some other ones ^^) are leaving at the end of this year... damn. Alastair Stanley, Sally, Stefan, 'The cool short blonde one', and many more wonderous individuals. Who can forget Sam Taunton... He was in a coma 6 months ago and the whole school prayed (not literally prayed) that he'd be back with us in September. And he was. We love him dearly.  OOOH the woman who played my mother in Book of The Banshee came to see us! We ought to wring her filthy little neck but she's so good looking and has wonderful copper hair... *_*  Can't think of anything else to write other than... waaaah it's all gone!  "For today our Pirate 'Prentice Rises, from indenture freed, Strong his arm, and keen his scent is, He's a pirate now, indeed!"  From   My first Solo Bit ^^   In   The Pirates of Penzance   Love, Jon Roskilly
