I am about to pee my pants, I am so excited. yesterday the cable guy arrived with two brand spanking new digital video recording boxes and promptly changed the rest of my life..  I can now go to the bathroom without missing part of that computer show on G4TechTV (whatever it is now). I can pause television on a whim, and(if i choose) come back hours, days, weeks, or even months later and finish my show. Damn.. I was so excited, I spent an hour just looking at all the movies on television during the next week and picking and choosing which ones i wanted to digitally record.. and seeing that there are about 18 movie channels that we get now, there is no shortage. Damn... Who needs friends when you can watch movies for the rest of your life?
