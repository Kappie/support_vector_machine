They will crave brains. Delicious, deep fried, human brains.  Catching three billion gnats should prove to be rather cumbersome. To accomplish this mighty task, I will enlist the help of many thousand specially trained, undead ant-eaters. They will be specially trained to eat gnats instead of ants.  Now, I just need to catch a few thousand ant-eaters, kill them all, bring them back from the dead under my control, and give them a bloodlust for gnats.  As you well know, ant-eaters are fierce predators, and in order to subdue them, I will enlist the help of 17 undead badgers, three atomic monsters (I was thinking Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra), and a genetically engineered screaming albino gorrilla.  The badgers will be easy, as I have an illegal badger farm behind my computer desk. The atomic monsters owe me big time. I'm sure I can engineer something along the lines of a gorilla in my laboratory. Although I do believe I spilled egg-nog on my Albino-izer. Thats the machine that will make the gorilla white.  The only problem now is storage...  The battle will be cataclysmic, and the casualties severe, but I have to do something to pass the time, right?   Necromancy, truly LUCICROUS. LUDICROUS I SAY!  I'm well on my way to Professor Farnsworth status.
