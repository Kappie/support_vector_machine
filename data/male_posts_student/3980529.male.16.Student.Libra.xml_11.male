Anyway, with all the anticipations, here are a few things you HAVE TO follow:  1. Don't follow crap, as in November 9th is the release date, any other release dates for Halo 2 just DOESN'T MATTER.  2.  No Demo UNTIL THE GAME COMES OUT!  Yep, so ilovebees.com... no no, it's just hyping you up for tons of info on August 24th, nothing more.   3. NO ONE HAS THE GAME!!!  If someone says they have the game or something, you know what you have to do, no, not get proof with pics, but actually SEE THE GAME for yourself, although it will only be a BETA game, hey, proof is proof, and even pics can't prove crap.   So there you, I know EVERYONE has been waiting forever for this game, but just hang tight, what makes me NOT want to wait for this game is the fact that school is two months in already.  Which means homework... projects and yeah, sleeping early.  So maybe that would be a way to get you "less" hyped up for the game.  I'll be updating frequently with matches I have had, and remember this is MY MULTIPLAYER NAME:  Deadmeister, so if you hear that name around the blog, yeah that's me!
