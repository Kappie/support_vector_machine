These people either don't know (bad), or don't care (worse), what the UN really is.   Take for example, the UN Council on Human Rights.  This council is responsible for safeguarding the simple inalienable rights of every member UN nation.  You would think that the United States should at least be  on  this council if not leading it, wouldn't you?  What nation's citizens have more freedoms than those of the United States?  The truth is, the US was voted  off  the council, which is now headed by the delegates from Libya.  Libya is as far from being a "free" country as Al Sharpton is from being President of the United States.  Quadafi, the leader (dictator) of Libya, has had his country bombed and put under economic sanctions during the Reagan administration for harboring terrorists and seeking WMDs.  Is this really the best choice of country to be on, more or less  lead , the Council on Human Rights?   Take Rwanda for another example.  Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were murdered during a bloody, uncontrolable, civil war in the early 90s.  What did the UN (which is responsible for peace in Rwanda) do about this atrocity?   Absolutely nothing.   The blue helmeted UN peacekeepers stood and watched, weapons in hand, while this genocide took place.   Think about this the next time you hear John Kerry talk about how "important" the UN is.
