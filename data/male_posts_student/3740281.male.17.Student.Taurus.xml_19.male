Today's read "Time is valuable, spend it wisely." It made me wonder what i could do to spend my time wisely. Stay on aim all day and not do jack shit? i mean i do that all the time, i swear ive spent 2/3 of my summer online and the other 1/6 with the friends i was talking to while i was online, and the other 1/6 at the gym. which by the way, the gym hasnt helped at all...im still weighing close to nothing...but anyways, why spend all this time online? its not exactly necessary...so, time to cut down. i'll still be on every night most likly, but never as long anymore.  time cannot be spent wisely unless it is spent with you
