Nevertheless, we emerged from the station confident we would have a great time.  The first thing that hit me here was the humidity. It must have been 33 degrees as it felt very sticky indeed. We needed to book into our hotel to ensure we could dump our heavy bags somewhere. We're staying at the hebei hotel which is 5 mins walk from the train station and conveniently designed for travellers from yuqi's home province. The room is a fantastically cheap 148 yuan per night, which is less than 10 pounds!  After a brief encounter with a hotel organised tour guide (who seemed to know less about the area than yuqi did) we decided to shop around for tours ourselves. In the end we found a very helpful company who is taking us to the yellow mountain (huang shen) and another city for a couple of thousand yuan. Not bad for 5 days travel and accommodation :)  other than that, we browsed around a very trendy high street with lots of designer shops and stopped for some food and drink. Later, we went back to the hotel to get cleaned up before seeing shanghai at night.  We left late, after 9 pm to see the city. It's lovely at night, but we left it a little too late to see the significant sights. In the end, we were being approached every 2 mins by someone begging or trying to sell up something, so we headed back to the hotel.  I must say, the shanghai accent is very strange and hard to understand. It's almost a completely different language, sounding a little like japanese. Even yuqi has some difficulty understanding it!  My mobile battery is running low, so that's all i have time for until i can find a chinese plug adapter for it. So goodbye for today :)
