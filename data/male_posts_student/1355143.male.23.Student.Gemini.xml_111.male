But nice to know that our little community continues to grow, if ever so slowly.....  I am at my desk, was another late night and early morning but I am getting used to it, becoming more of a robot every day and actually enjoying it, which is a bit sick! But hey ho, whatever floats your boat!  Apart from work I don't really have much of a life so I wont even pretend that I have anything interesting to say, all I wanted to do was encourage more people to post so that at least I know that other people are doing interesting things (this is turning into a bit of a sob story!).  Ciao for now,  A
