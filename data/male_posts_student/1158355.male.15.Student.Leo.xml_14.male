We played HALO, pretty sick game, with the trucks. After that we went up to the High School and played football... for like 2 seconds. It got too cold so we went back inside, then went out into the neighborhood and shoveled 2 driveways and each of us got $20 each. When I took my glove off, my thumb was all black and I was going crazy thinking I had frost bite. Ended up being the snow seaping the leather black color through the glove and into my skin. When I got home I had to babysit my younger sister Alison. The whole thing was pretty annoying... I'm not gonna' mention why but I have to thank a couple of people for bringing me out of what happened. You know who you are. Ok, I'm STARVING! good night... ANGELICA WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU!!!!
