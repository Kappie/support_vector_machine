This girl at work, Maria... makes me angry! She gets mad at me for no reason.. I don't care much.. but I don't like people leaving mad... fucking vegetarians. Well anywayzz.. The last week has been pretty uneventful, so I skipped this blog.. Thought of writing in it, but I'm all like.. "well, it would end up being a shit entry..(now i think about it, All my entries are shit.) " Well anywayz... I wrote a new poem.. dun remember exactly when, and I dunno even if it was before the last entry and if it was mentioned.. But its called "Meanign of Life" you can find it at the poetry section at  urlLink http://clams.animeconnection.net  or at  urlLink http://clams.deviantart.com .  It's really bad compared to the ones I wrote with feeling. But meh  X_____x...  So basically, heres the low-down on my life...  I'm a 15 year old boy from Ottawa. I live in my parents basement and go to a catholic-french highschool. I excel at Math and Computers. I have more than one best friend and lots of secondary, less important friends. I don't smoke (or drink ^___- ) and I am highly against it. My parents divorced when I first started school, which I think might've caused alot of the problems I had at school up to grade 6. At grade 7, I changed schools for the 4th time to get to a place where I ddnt fit in, but I wasnt outcasted. After that, I got to high school, where I spent a year being a total slacker and watching my grades fall from a 85 to a 64 average. I was disappointed. Every once in awhile I write poetry. Its fun and keeps me outta trouble. Sometimes I get lonely.. but I dont care...gives me poem fuel. ^______^  So thats the low-down...
