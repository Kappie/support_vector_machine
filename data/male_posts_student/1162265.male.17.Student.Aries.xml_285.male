Rocket- "I need a joint." Tiago- "Instead of smoking, man, You should snort coke.  It's really far out." Angelica- "You snort Tiago? I prefer a good toke." Rocket- "If you like I can get it for you." Tiago  - "You can? Well go on. Move your ass." Tiago- "But the choice stuff is coke. That's a real nercotic." Rocket and Angelica- "Narcotic!"  It's really funyn because in portugese he says  "intoxin" or something like that and Angelica and Rocket are like "Intoxico!" Haha.  And it's even better because Tiago is seriously high through the entire movie.  It's even better because seriously, that movie makes you want to smoke weed, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE smoked weed in that movie.  Rocket and his friend (Stringy?) hitch hiked with this guy from Sao Paulo, and he gave them weed.  Rocket went home with this lady she smoked weed.  Angelica smoked weed.  The Tender Trio smoked weed.  Carrot Smoked Weed.  Blacky smoked weed.  Li'l Dice smoked weed.  Everyone in that movie smoked weed, except the hot girl in the bakery who they only showed for like 2 seconds, but I'm sure she smoked weed on the weekends.  Ain't it funny?
