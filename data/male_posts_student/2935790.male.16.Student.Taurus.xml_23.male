Whenever you enter a room traveling above walking speed, you must hold an object (preferably a firearm) at a potent 90Â° 'strong-arm' angle, and scream, "Get on the ground!" or, "Put your hands above your head!" at least once, and it has to be at least 4.6 dB (decibels) louder than your normal voice. 2.  Anytime you witness an awry or corrupt occurrence you  must  intervene by means of physical, verbal, or mental force, but don't waste your time trying to shoot mind rays, only I can do that.  Trust me, I'm awesome. 3.  If someone is really stupid, like  really  stupid (ie "The Cheese Dentures Incedent" hahah) you  must  kill them.  What?  Oh, right, there are laws against that. Well...Kill them, then kill anyone who objects, and just to be sure you're safe, kill yourself. 4. Buy me a digital video camera, I'll love you for life and I'm serious.  Aww hell, I can't resist that smile, I'll always love  you .  It would be appreciated though.  There you have it, so now it is up to you.  I leave you with these words of wisdom passed down onto me by my good friend glucose;  Be awesome, kick some ass, and don't be stupid.  Practice every day, you'll know you've achieved awesomeness when you can shoot mind rays like me.  G'night!
