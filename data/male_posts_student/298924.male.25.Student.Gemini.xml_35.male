As I typed my last entry, my personal space was violated....someone entered my home and took small items, but even more frightening took whatever sense of security I had in that little shack....  My roommate is shook....I am shook....our parents are shook....and thus ends our happy home....it is very highly likely that I will move into a far more expensive, but also far more conveniant (and yes, safe) apartment in the Meharry Towers, the closest thing to student housing that we have here....  This morning I bent my key as the door was closing....a bent key.....yeah that just about sums me up right about now....you figure it out....
