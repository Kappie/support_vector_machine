It was nice and relaxing and too bad it was so expensive =P and too bad yuki couldn't come... and hoshi and r2vq ^^;; =P oh, and the rest of KKEY... and um... those... other... ppl that go to anime...   - mostly in my week off, i've been gunbound-ing a lot... want to get arcangel wings... so expensive =\ and the usual lj-ing, konquest-ing... and today, i did a massive multi-hour clean-up that left me drained. oh well, everything is nice and neat now.   - as expected, my dad wants me to do work to prepare for summerschool. he's also forcing me to wake early to prepare for school. yes... how bout we all spend our lives preparing for death. that way we'll all be nice and ready for the coffin.   - will try to read a bunch of books, play some duel monsters, create some kinda board game that i haf tinkering in my head, and watch X/1999 (anime that sounds interesting). Oh, and will try to get to CNAnime. Exercise, summer school and learning some computer languages are also on the menu  aaanndd that's basically about all... i could already imagine yuki telling me how boring that is... =P    EDIT: wow, blogger looks so nice now! kudos to google for making it so prettiful =P oh, and to keane, yup, i put my titles where it says title now ^^;; sry bout before, thought i'd be... um... coding-ish-ly...?   EDIT #2: noooo... it's not possible to archive the rest of the posts that are not visible on the home page =\ the blogger thingie prevents copy and paste in this edit section... *sigh* there goes a dozen or so posts >  i was able to back up the posts starting from this one to keane's "click here for anime north picture" post... anywhere from that point on to my "of memories and present" post is not back-upped
