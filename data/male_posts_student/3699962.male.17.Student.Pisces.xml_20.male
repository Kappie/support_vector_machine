I dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before...'   I got myself in for a whole lot of trouble today. I unwittingly got myself as the head of some planning committee for a carnival happening on Racial Harmony Day. Ouchies. I'm just hoping God helps me through this!  I picked out a couple of pictures to put in my locker already. It's cool! Cause I got myself some photo clips specially for lockers. Hee. I should put up a picture of it here when its done.  Sigh. Changes... Gerald from my secondary school's leaving for New Zealand tomorrow. When I saw Jocelyn's nick saying we should meet at 6 at the Changi Airport MRT Station, I seriously thought it was 6am! Well anyway... So many people that were in my life are going overseas already. There was Jessie, Aarika and now Gerald. Joanna's going overseas soon too. I think it's a matter of time before I decide to leave too. Sigh.  Nostalgia sets in as the memories I have of those peeps sorta surface.  Sherm.
