After speaking with the person, they didn't want the chequed ripped up, thus voiding it. No, they wanted the blank cheque mailed back to them. Why, you ask? I'll never know. Oh well, it's on its way to Hazelton tomorrow.  and i'm out, 8 hour shift tomorrow is gonna be killer  jared "insert witty remark here" euverman   listening to : the TV i'm too lazy to turn off  feeling : tired  quote of the day :   "It's raining"   - Daniel as we started to play beach volleyball at 8 am.
