So, we go on about our lives, and eventually, we forget about our unanswered prayers. Then one day, out of nowhere, BLAM, God listens. So where was the prayer. Was it lost in the mail? Was God's inbox a little too full? Or was He simply waiting for the right moment to respond?   A while back...like maybe 10 or 11 months, I was still big into God. I used to pray that Crystal would find God. She always said he hated her. I told her otherwise, but she never listened. So I prayed, that God help her know Him. Eventually, I gave up. Then, I started falling away from God. Some of my personal views and beliefs aren't in agreeance with the church. Most of them are, but there are the few exceptions. Anyway, last night we had a talk. She's been talking to Barry, and now we've decided to slow down a bit. Well, a lot. She wanted to act completely like friends. I can't have that. So we agreed on holding hands and kissing each other goodbye. She challenged me to put my life in perspective, and when I look at it, I have really grown away from what I once was, and what I love. I don't know where I'm going with this, but I do love Crystal, and I guess God knew exactly when he'd need her to find God, because I'd need to find Him, too...   urlLink  postCount('prayers');
