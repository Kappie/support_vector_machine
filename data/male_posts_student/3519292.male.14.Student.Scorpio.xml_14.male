I can't stand it when people who are not educated on a given subject profess their extreme viewpoints as if they had actually taken the time to develop the ridiculous opinions they feel the need to express. They ramble on without regard for attempts by those with actual knowledge of the subject to point out the flaws in their erroneous beliefs, and refuse to acknowledge any reasonable argument against themselves. I'm sorry but "STFU" and "NUH UH" are not adequate responses when confronted with major design flaws in one's theory.  If I am ever out of my depth in a certain topic or discussion, which does not happen often, I prefer to listen to those who are more well informed than myself and ask question to better my own understanding. I choose not to accost those I should be learning from with incoherent babble, but to conduct myself in a scientific demeanor, so that I might eloquently express myself to some tragically unversed fool in the future.  In closing, Please, you mighty offenders of civilized discourse, stop pretending like you know everything. You are annoying those of us that do.
