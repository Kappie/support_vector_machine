I return to the life I left behind of small town livin and the girl I could picture growin old with. Right away when I come back I am told my grandmother has cancer and it is really serious. This nearly kills me because I used to spend summers with her she was practicly a second mother to me. I went on though I was together with my old gf again and everything was going good. Then my mom has to end up having back surgery. I spend a whole morning waiting in a hospital waiting to see if my mom is alright. Then I get a call from my gf to see if I'm still gonna pick her up so we could go do our voulenteer work together like we always do I tell her I'm at the hospital and I'll be on my way in a bit so I head out and she is already at the place we voulenteer. We do our work and she is seeming extremly pissy so I ask her what's wrong and she says nothin. We finish up our work her barely talking to me at all. Then on the way home she tells me she can't see me anymore. The only reason she can give me is that she has changed and I havn't. WOW!! Now my life consists of daily work outs in preperation for football my mom is still outta work and now my ex is hangin out with my friend and everyone that i actually still get along with after a year long absence. It all just pisses me off. Not to mention this lame ass town that I'm liven in is driving me nuts with nothing to do. I swear I'm gonna go nuts and sneak back to Brazil. It was nice bein home for the first day then it went to hell.
