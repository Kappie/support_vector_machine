MTV Latino is aired all over Latin America, and is also available on several satellite and cable packages in the U.S.  Go to the  urlLink Squirtgun  website to see the video, I saw it, and it was pretty good, it guest stars Kris Roe from the Ataris  Also another punk rock musician has made a blog...The bassist for Squirtgun: Mass Giorgini.  THere will be a link to that on the side right after I finish typing this post.  Also listen to this: 4.03.04 - Flav's main guitar from the early days of Squirtgun in being auctioned on  urlLink ebay . This guitar was used on Squirtgun's debut CD in 1995. It was also used on Screeching Weasel's Wiggle and Anthem For A New Tomorrow, and several other sessions. Flav bought it new in 1989 and used it in Rattail Grenadier and Squirtgun. Bid here on a piece of punk rock history!  That would be really sweet to get that guitar...I mean it was on a screeching weasel cd...lol this is what it is called on the bidding site:   Epiphone SG Squirtgun Screeching Weasel Guitar      Well that's all for now, i found alot of good music news today :)
