(mind you, the only tolerable movie version of "hamlet"... surprise, surprise... the infallinble kenneth branagh does the impossible.)  i hate babbling.  especially when i'm just doing it for the sake of babbling.  no i love it.  and particularly when i'm doing it for that purpose.     i swear i'll not let insomnia rob me of another perfectly good night's sleep.  oh fine... i will.  i know i will.  i just reminded myself in talking to melody that i haven't seen kenneth branagh's "much ado about nothing" in far too long.  gah... that just roped me into 2 or so hours...
