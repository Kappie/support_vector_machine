I have a Maths (Pure 1) and two Design Technology exams, hopefully they'll go OK.  I've got two Chemistry exams on Thursday, Im dropping the subject after those exams, I don't need it, I don't like it, and I don't want to do it.  I start work next monday, which should be alright.  I spoke to my mum the other day about the possibillity of me going over to the USA around November/December time to go to Michael Jackson's Trial, I know he's innocent, but I want to be there to cheer for him when he comes and goes from the court room, and I want to boo when Tom Sneddon walks past. Hopefully my parents will allow me to go.  I need a hair cut, I haven't had one in like 7 weeks!!! I usually have one every 3/4 weeks, but some for some reason I aint had it cut for ages. I can get it to come down to the tip of my nose now. Might wear a hair band to school tomorrow - would be different.  I must go now, and do some more revision for my crappy exams. I'm probably going to end up re-sitting one or two of them, so I'm just not motivated to do the revision - sigh.  *Tibsy, has left the building*  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - The Way You Make Me Feel.
