I must give my tidings to a great game that I will miss much (well, sorta).  Final Fantasy XI FFXI That game that you play so much Your addictive little drug The white powder found on your nose...  There are many names for the game.  Some of them explain the game better than others.  I had about 18 days on my game before I had to quit (btw, I quit for many different reasons, not one reason alone).  One thing that I am glad of: I don't have a F***ing 60+ days on mine (I'm looking at YOU Adam)!!!  It was an addiction... well, sorta.  But it was fun as anything!  Yeah, so, it is now gone and I will never play it again on my own character.  Well... yeah, now onto summer (it should really have a kick ass name... like... um... Ass Kicker of School... or something... you know ^^;).  I have a pile of crap to do before school starts.  Lemme make a list: Learn Japanese, Run my ass off, Run some more, Get in shape for running, Learn C++ (o.O;;), and have fun while doing it all.  It's a crazy schedule that I have to make to do all of this.  I hope I can do it ^^;.  Oh, and throw in all of this random  junk like volunteering for things so that I look "well rounded" to colleges.  Yeah... I'm gonna be busy.  Wow... I SUCK at ranting.  I want to rant, but I can't think of anything to type.  Hmm...  Well... um... I know!  Guess what?!?  Me and James actually fixed* his computer.  I think by some miracle God has given us the power to cleanse computers of disease (wow, that sounded much better in my head).  Ok, well, I'm tired (if you can't read the title... failures...).  I'm gonna go and do stuff on the computer and then do whatever it is I do...  Yeah, without Final Fantasy XI I do a lot of junk... You'll see!  Really!  I don't have a problem!  *Runs away to the... computer...*  *By fixed we do not actually mean totally, but compared to before it is a god unto itself ^^
