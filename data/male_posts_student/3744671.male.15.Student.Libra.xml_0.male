Well, for those of you who don't know (shame on you, j/p) the original Star Wars Triogy is being released for the first time on DVD as a box set! It'll have all three original films; that's A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi. Plus extra features you can't find anywhere else!  Start savin'! With all the cool DVD's AND video games coming out in the near future, make sure you have some spare cash lying around!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
