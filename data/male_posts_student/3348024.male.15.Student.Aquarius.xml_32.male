That's right.  I do.) I ever did drink.  I didn't drink too much though, because Amber's mom knew we would be drinking and I had a good idea that we would probably get caught and I didn't want to be too fucked up when we did.  Then, after everyone was done drinking their vodka and OJ we went to Java Jim's... And it sucked.  The band was possibly the worst band I have ever heard.  Their lyrics contained all "MAHHHHHH's", "GAHHHHHHH'S", and "RAHHHHHH's."  To go along with the crappy vocals, the vocalist was fat and was wearing girls pants and a tight shirt.  Sooo... we went to the outside area and as we walked throught the door, some A-hole started bitching at us, telling us to close the door because the neighbors would call the cops if we left it open because the music was too loud.  Ya know what?  Fuck you, I don't really if they pull the plug on that band, they suck.  Sommer, Chadd, and I left about 15 minutes later.  When we walked into the hotel room Kathy was in there and she said, "I found the orange juice, where's the vodka?"(we put the vodka in the safe and took the key.)  We said we didn't know and went swimming.  Then she went to Java Jim's to get the rest of the people and they gave her the key to the safe.  lol, she was pretty pissed off, but we didn't get in trouble.   Ok, honestly, who puts a mirror in front of a toilet?  Honestly, I don't like watching myself pee.  It's just really weird.  TBC
