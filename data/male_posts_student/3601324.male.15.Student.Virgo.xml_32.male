Zefer:  I have no clue what autism is, though. =b  Urza:  It's like "living in your own little word".  Zefer:  Shit.  Zefer:  I want autism. =(  Urza:  ...it's a mental retardation...  Zefer:  ...Oh.  Zefer:  ...I'm not sure I want autism.   Urza:  Pity yiff, Baha?  Baha:  ...What?  Urza:  What?  jd:  what?  Zefer:  Am I supposed to say what?  jd:  probably  Zefer:  'What?'  Urza:  Way to crap on the oysters, Zefer.   jd:  it makes them taste better  Zefer:  How do you know that?  Urza:  Well I guess a negative plus a negative has to equal a possitive, eh?  Baha:  It's a negative multiplied by a negative.  Baha:  A negative plus a negative would equal a greater negative.  Urza:  I rest my case.  jd:  i rest mine too.  Zefer:  I don't have a case.  Urza:  Yeah, you do! A NUTCASE!  Urza:  *sitcom audience laughter*  Zefer:  PWNED. =(  Baha:  Going now...   Zefer:  But... hmm... Saskatchewan is close to the US border as well, but it's friggin' FREEZING there.  Blitzy:  and saskatchewan is in the middle isn't it? because then it makes sense it being a lot colder in the winter  Zefer:  Yeah, Saskatchewan is kind of in the middle.  Blitzy:  then it should be colder because it doesn't have any sea around it  Zefer:  =O  Zefer:  I see.  Zefer:  Didn't know that. =b  Urza:  Wouldn't places BY the sea be colder?  Rob:  Yeah.   Zefer:  I don't know how it works, but it seems true. =b  Blitzy:  nah, which is why the UK is never that cold, because it's an island and surrounded by the sea  Baha:  We had a question about that in Physics...  Baha:  I just wrote something about pirates.
