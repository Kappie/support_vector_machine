White lights with simple silver and blue decorations and and and it is 7 and 1/2 feet tall!  So, we went to make cookies and Samantha was in charge of them and well.... She can't cook worth shyte.  The first set of batter was like hard as a frickin' rock, to the point that it stuck to the electric mixer in this big ball of stuff.  It then would alllow us to get out the dough so we tossed the bowl and the dough into the garbage...  then the second batch she decided to add milk which wasn't in the recipe at all!  So then these cookies thened out running, I was like great! Lol, I needed that, so she puts them into the oven and the nice fishy smell comes out of the oven as they are cooking.  So we pull them out when they are done and there are the ugliest cookies in this entire world!  So, they stuck to the pan as well....  And so we named them scratch-and-sniff cookies.  Lol, when Sam told me this I decided to really scratch-and-sniff them, and may I say I am not blonde.  I didn't fall for the scratch-and-sniff sticker on the bottom of the filled bathtub!  Although I was very tempted... It was banana!  So, anyways then we had to drop Mike off at his house  *tear* I was having fun, he is really cool! Gosh! I mean he has some issues that I want to help him with. I care a lot about him and all of his life's drama is sooo unnecessary and unwanted. I swear that he is someone who doesn't deserve this negative treatment. So, anyways then we went back to my house with Shane and Sam and the doorbell rings and I rush to the door and slid on the wood floor and and hit my arse flat on the ground. And, while me and Sam were making smores in my fireplace Chris called and I talked to him, he is also a cutie! But, then one of the cutiest guys here in Virginia Beach, the closet-case calls! OMG, I loved talkin' to him! Lol, I fell again this time out of my chair when on the phone and eating smores, it was very talented. I loved my fall.com! I wrote another poem for Jared! Tehe, long time, no writing for poetry, so yet again Jared inspired me again!    Waiting  Across the distance, 1,100 miles  I wait with heavy heart  Knowing your voice makes me smile  Only more 30 more days to keep us apart   Only 30 more days to stop us from it  Although I would wait 20 plus years more  I still can't wait to see your face when I open up my door  I would hope that you wouldn't with to quit   Only 300 more days till we will greet  To the time once your sparkling green eyes, to mine meet  I can't wait to feel your embrace  To look up and smile and stare at your sweet face   Only 30 more days to I can enjoy your company  Laughing, giggling, and so much more glee  I can't wait to hold on to you tight  And, to fall asleep with you in my arms at might   Across the distance, 1100 miles plus  I am waiting with my heavy heart  Know you can please me  And in thirty days we will be
