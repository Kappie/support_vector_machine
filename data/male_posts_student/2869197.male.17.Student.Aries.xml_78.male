There are things that I wish to say: witty retorts, friendly expressions, knowledgeable dicussions. But I can't. The words don't come to my mind. The words that do comedon't leave my lips. Andit's not only words. My body is arevulting mess,I cannotdance or sing or even look right. I have no skills, I cannot draw or build or work. I don't even have enough willpower totrain these skills.My thoughts tend to remain mine and are never shared or expressed. This saddens me. I cannot explain why. I should be uncaring as to whether people know what I feel. I'm a loner, and a male loner at that; remember the rock? But I do care. I want to share, to teach, to learn. But alas. It is not so.
