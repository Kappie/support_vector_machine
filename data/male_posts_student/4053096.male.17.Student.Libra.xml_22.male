Mr. Entriken (or however you spell it), taught our class this morning. I guess that Brandon is gone somewheres or something. Yeah. After church we went to Greenbriar Bar-b-que, because Mrs. Donna is here. She's here because Anthony is coming back from Iraq. So that's cool and all. Greenbriar is awesome. Really good. When we got there though, we got there at 1:00 and there were like a billion people in front of us. So we had to wait for the like, ten groups of two, the group of 20, the group of 7, and some other group. It took awhile, and I hadn't eaten breakfast. Talk about agony. oh well, I'm fine now. Bible Bowl study started today. Fun stuff there. Yeah... We have a whole stinkin' bunch a guys in our class. They're all at that age that they think that they are really cool, but in reality they are totally not. More like, really annoying. Well, we have them and Chris; but it's hard to make a distinction at times. ugh. Chris made me  really  perturbed today in BB class. We were talking and Chris said that he had "hired servants" (we were on that topic) because he had some kids at his school doing his homework for him (which probably isn't true anyway). But then Dad said that that wasn't really a good thing for him to do. Then Chris, and I quote, said, "Well I'm taking a college level history class, bud." And I'm like (to myself) "Bud?  BUD ?! That's my   Dad   you're talkin' to!!" I so wanted to beat his face in right then; but I didn't say anything; I held back. UGH. He has no respect. And he's all bragging about driving before David was. And Dave and I are like, "no, David got his permit before you". And then he starts on this whole "I was driving before I got my permit" thing; which probably isn't true, but still. I hate those people that think they know everything and try to tell you that you don't know what the crap you're talking about, when in reality, they are the one that has no stinkin' clue. They make me so freakin' frustrated. Ok, I'm starting to get a little fired up. I had better stop.
