What happened to the good old days of volcanos and surprsies?  Next, social status:     It doesnt seem to have any affect at all.  Whoever you were before means nothing now as you are remembered by 6th and 7th grade.  Last, relationships:     I've been noticing these a lot.  You may be thinking to yourself, "Gee, Nick must be really lonely now.  So he's spying on other people."  But I've got 80 years to go before I start to be the horny old man hiding in the bushes asking you and your girlfriend to kiss.  Anyway, nowadays, I've been finding them a lot more funny than usual.  All the flirting, all the staring, and all the ignorance.  When everything ends (and they always do) the people act dead.  We constantly forget, WE'RE KIDS!  I blame it on school, to be honest.  We're treated like children for most of life, until we get to middle school.  Then we get shocked into adulthood and it has an effect on EVERYTHING.  Just my feelings on a few things, no real purpose.  I just had 900 something hits I didnt deserve.  Go America..................  BOO
