I went to the law school bookstore to buy some paper for my printer and made an impulse purchase -- a miniature stapler for $3.00.  It's sad when a stapler becomes an impulse buy.  But I needed it.  Because when I handed in my legal memo -- which needed to be staple, according to the instructor's oh-so-informative "last minute questions" e-mail -- I had to go lurking around the administrative offices until I found one with a stapler right on the front desk that I could sneak in and quickly use.  I saw "Red Dragon" last night.  It was okay -- for a scary movie (not my usual preferred genre -- I like my movies short and funny) it was pretty good.  Today is "Field Day" from 12-5, featuring activities like Tug of War, Dodgeball, and Check a Footnote in Twenty Seconds.  Or something like that.  I have rehearsal from 12-2, so I'll be late to Field Day, but according to what people have been saying, the turnout won't be that good anyway.  More about Field Day later.
