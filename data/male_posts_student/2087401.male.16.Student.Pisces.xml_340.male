When is the blog going online? What is the name of the blog?  Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title?  Who is Joining the LN Blog?  Is Nathan going to be administrator?  Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium?  Is Marten Joining?  If Marten is joining can I join?   Answers would be appreciated!  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
