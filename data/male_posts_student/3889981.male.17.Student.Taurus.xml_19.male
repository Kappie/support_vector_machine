In any case, it is terrible to assume that I have been lazing my time away while I have been away from this blog.  It should never be assumed also that I have been using my time with maximised efficiency because that would have been a lie.  Singapore Idol - the first two episodes have been, unfortunately, like its American predecessor - putting almost as much camera-zoom focus on the uncut, uncensored and untalented compared to those that has the power and the vocals.  I'm going back to my seat though.
