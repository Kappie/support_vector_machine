Its the same throughout the year.The temperature varies from 25c to 35c all through the year.There is no winter , no hot summer . Its warm, humid with inter-mittent rains all round the year.Rains are unpredictable and of short spells (reminds me of Seattle,US).       So no sweaters or overcoats in S'pore.Just normal clothes would do.That is a nice welcome from the damn Delhi weather (Dai Venky , I know you will disagree with me ).
