Sorry to you vegetarians and turkeys out there, but you're either too edible and/or unable to eat the awesomeness that is a turkey sandwich.  Every time I go to a place that serves turkey sandwiches (especially Chilli's) I order it. I mean, I prolly could survive in the middle of nowhere with no human contact if I had an infinite amount of turkey sandwiches. As sad as this may sound, eating a turkey sandwich makes my day.  You should know, however, that that isn't sad because turkey sandwiches kick ass.  I saw "Dodgeball" today, and Chuck Norris was in it. So I recommend that you watch it, because Chuck Norris is the badest ass person ever, and he makes the movie totally worth it.  Also, the movie's pretty funny.
