Sadly for you, I have just been buying time for which to compose a newer, longer post for all 2 of you to read !  The site statistics are promising, so I'm expecting quite a number of avid readers this time around.  Yesterday was interesting, mainly due to the fact that I purchased a number of interesting items during my shopping trip.  First of all, it was a Peter Kay Live DVD : 'Bolton Albert Halls', which I would highly recommend to any fan of his excellent comedy series, 'Phoenix Nights'.   Quotes : "Don't pull that ... It's for warden !" ...  followed by  "Sorry, It's me grandson ... He thought it were t'big light".   The second purchase was a very good guide to Photoshop 7, 'Photoshop 7.0 A - Z'.  It's a great book, with a really good cover price of £17.99, the average Photoshop book being £30 !  It explains how to do absolutely everything under the sun, and is illustrated with full-colour screenshots throughout.  The Appendices are also incredible, with a comparison chart, plugin descriptions and recommended websites.  Well worth buying !  The final purchase of the day was the stunningly funny French film 'Les Visiteurs', which if you haven't seen it, is about a French knight and his servant who get transported to the 20th Century ... Monty Python meets Blackadder, definately.   Quote : "Look Sire, a Moor !"  They procede to smash up a car.
