I can only shout at the top of my lungs, and that's about it. No other accents, all I can do is shout. Kinda sucks, knowing that I can't break out of the stereotypical shouting character.   I've learned 3 new songs for the guitar! Smoke On The Water, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Heartbreaker! Go me! I'm getting better everyday.  Wow, it's hot here in Washington. High today was like 97. Crazy how we live in the Pacific Northwest, yet it feels like California. Someones fallen asleep at the weather controls.  Got nothing much else to say...shout outs to Ashlee, Jimmy, Allison, Ally, Steven, Ben, Ben, Tom and the rest of the cast in the play! Great job, guys!  ---Ben B, who heard the London is drowning, and he lives by the river. Mood: Happy Listening to: The Clash - London Calling Thought: I suck at acting.
