Then nothing else happened except I got a double bass drum peddle, a Matrix Reloaded and Linkin Park poster and new furniture and a rug. Wow, I am spoiled. Thanks to my dad, I love the guy. Then Jimmy came over for a bit to see some stuff (furniture) and he showed me his burnt illegal Matrix Reloaded on DVD. Then I heard the Jamaican music, thought it was the tabernacle across the street but it was only a little party blasting music. I went to go see it and when I finally saw it the music stopped, you know what that means! The girls stopped dancing! Ok... I'm going back to see it because the music started again and I wanna see girls dance... because I have no life... and I'm desperate... and I use spoons, not forks. JESUS! THIS MUSIC IS SO AWESOME!
