Spiderman 2 ROCKS sia! cool lah! haha... i think the CGI was really good and besides, there were some really cool jokes! even though there are times that i got really pissed with the fact that they got alot of the facts wrong, man... the whole show on the overall was really fantastic! haha...  Hmm... what can i say lah... Kirsten Durnst is really good looking lah! and wah lau... why in every Spiderman show, there is showing of her... essentials?! damn it... can get people's mind to wander one ok?! haha... anyway... really realise how much i miss the company of my secondary school friends especially people like Shawn and Zhi Wei! haha... Rating is damn fun and a well missed activity that we always do... but... it's good to do it with you guys again!  haha... wah lau... Zhi Wei, don't monk us lah... we all know the truth lah! haha... Shawn, i buaya?! haha... no lah... somebody in the middle of the movie also can spot girls ah?! haha... just as we were watching fighting scene somemore! wah lau!  haha... anyway, the jokes in Spiderman 2 are also quite cool lah! haha... like the lift part where Spidey converses with the guy about his costume... haha... 'it looks uncomfortable', and spidey simply replies something like, 'it's ok... just that it rides up the crotch at times'! haha... anyway... still go the part where he jumps over the building screaming... 'I'm back! i'm back!' and falss to say... 'ow... my back! my back!' haha... i think the show has an equal balance and something for other movies to learn from! haha...  heex... Rinoa chio right?! haha... yeah well... wish that i could be as lucky as Squall and find someone who loves me or rather... someone whom i can be with like Rinoa.. doesn't have to be as chio... but... i don't mind! haha... no lah... just want someone whom... aiyo... i can't explain... nevermind... haha... okok...
