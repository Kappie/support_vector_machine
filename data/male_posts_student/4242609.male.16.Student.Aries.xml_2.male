Here are my thoughts:     Chad Pennington looked very good, as usual    Curtis Martin is a lot more healthy than in years past, he will have a very good year    Vilma is a beast. He better be in the starting lineup by the time the season starts    The first string defense looked good as a whole. Of course, they were facing a backup QB, and Duece McCallister only had about 2 carries. Next Saturday's game against the Colts will be a much bigger test.    If Pennington gets hurt, I will kill myself. Brooks Bollinger is awful. Ricky Ray looks even worse so far. Hopefully one of them will step it up soon     The Yankees continue to roll along. I'm happy that we are playing so well and probably have our best team since 98, but it would be nice to be in a close playoff race for once. With a 10.5 game lead over Boston, and a 10 game lead over Oakland for homefield advantage in the playoffs, there doesn't appear to be much to get excited about until October. At least there are some other good races though. The AL Central, AL West, and both wildcards should go right down to the wire.    Team USA Basketball is a joke. Whether we lose the rest of our games, or win the gold, I really don't care. This team is boring to watch. If we win in a blowout, it's because we are supposed too, and are on a different level than the rest of the countries. If we win in a close game, it isn't exciting, it usually means we played like shit and were lucky to pull it out. And then when we lose in a blowout like today, it's just a total disgrace. I'm tired of just trying to put an all star team together. Find guys who fit what the team is trying to do. Or better yet, forget the NBA, and right after college season ends assemble a team full of college players. It will leave more time to practice, and will give us team basketball, instead of 12 superstars running around heaving up shots and turning the ball over. Maybe then, by the next olympics I'll watch more basketball than badminton.
