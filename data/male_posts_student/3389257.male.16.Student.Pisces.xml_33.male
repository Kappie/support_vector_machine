Lacened with revison and none too pleasing at that. Science. Haha. What a thing. Science is much like Jo; It smells funny and makes me want to kick it. I like kicking things. If I could, I'd go pro. I cannot. The pay is quite frankly rather pantsy. "pantsy"-to be very much of a rather bad qaulity, see pants.
