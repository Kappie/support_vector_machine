"Airell!! i asked for the camera first okayy!!"   "can you just let me use it for a moment or two?"   "no! i gotta do my practical!give it back to me!!!"   "here have it!!! slut...."     this only proves that the teenagers in singapore can only think of the cold and hard aspect of life!  RESULTS! MONEY! SUCCESS!! A 9-5 JOB!  i noticed that this is the only way i can survive in singapore. but please?!?! where's the more humane side of life?? love?friends? care? concern??integrity??     all these happenings only blatantly reflect that life in singapore is like a complete regimented schedule. we seem to know when we're gonna die and we cram everything a few minutes before we die. if i had a chance..i'd rather be oblivious to the fact that i'm gonna die one day! i'm just gonna live till i die. sigh..stress is shit! fuck you stresS! i hate you!! i freakin hate everything that you fucking implied upon me. i can't take it you bitch! fuck you stress! fuck you!!! man..i can't help swearing.is that what we really want in life? a nice coffin to sleep in? its sounds so sardonic. but ironically people are somehow "craving" to die nowadays. and i can't help it but i know i feel almost the same way too.  and during mathematics lesson..mrs cheng gave my a session of berrating at me. i finished my math homework but she reprimanded me for not helping my friends.. can't help it. sigh.. i thought to myself -you want the blind to lead the blind???-  another typical shitass example is lihui! his nick "i'm gonna claim back my topspot" who the fuck cares! if you wanna work for it. go for it!and thanks for that shit ass lecture you gave us "in SoS our midfieldare the ones that are failing our team bringing in our defence. WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT?!?! you wanna blame it all on us is it?! motherfucker.you can't take it..just quit shit ass wuss! backstabbing us like fuck! you think all of us have a wicked and sad little pee-wee mentality you have?! if i had a fucking weapon that i could kill you with. i'd do it if i had a chance! fook you! you're such a wuss..  well..i've said all i wanted for today.thanks shafik you are deeply gratified..i love you.
