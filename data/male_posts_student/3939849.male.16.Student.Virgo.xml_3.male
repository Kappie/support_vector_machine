The PZFN will be better than before... way better... One of the most important additions will be the incorporation of the  PassNet  technology I've been working on. I know it doesn't mean much at first but just listen. Ok, some of you have heard of Microsoft's .NET Passport and know that this is a system that allows one username and password for multiple sites... Well that's kind of what  PassNet  is.    PassNet Technologies    In Production by: PZF Productions / Acetone-Studio Developers    Key Features for Users:     One user account for all PassNet supported sites.    Key Features for Webmasters:     Any site can become a PassNet site!  Inlcude scripts will be available in PHP, ASP and CFM (and more in the future)...   Can be easily used in co-operation with a database to give users different levels of authentication on a site.     How is it possible?     XML! (more on this as this at a later date)    If you have any questions regarding PassNet please email me at mepcotterell@gmail.com
