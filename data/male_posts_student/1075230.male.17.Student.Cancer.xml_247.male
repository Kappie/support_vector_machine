God, i think i need more sleep. *looks at sleeping Dusty* she's so dammed cute...  well, wat was i saying? eh dunno, missed that train, let's see...i guess i can tell u about a dream i had last night. something about an opera, and a costume. masks. friends i dont kno in real life. running. dark big places. o_O seemed like a comedy. meh, no words to fully translate it.   *rubbs eyes* im thinking of using my tarrot cards to get dish out some lottery numbers. normally i wouldnt ever consider it, but it was something my dad said:   we were watching something on notradomus..however u spell it, and i said: "i dun get it, even if u had those powers, why would u wanna tell the future ne way?" "Yeah," agreed my dad, "but id try to win the lottery"   that kinda stuf wid me, and my tarrot cards haf kinda been catching my eye lately. wat the hell,, maybe ill try it out. i bet they feel neglected ne way.   ^.^   wow man, i feel sooo tired. *rubbs eyes* ^^dont worry tho, im otherwise my normal bitter self. lolzzzz  *hugs for everyone who reads this*!  ~Hoshi
