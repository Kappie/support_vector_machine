Although medyo foul trouble yung offensive idol ko(Cardona) step-up naman ung hangtime idol ko (Yeo) The speed, elevation and hangtime plus the hook plus the turn around jumper (Casio) plus Cabatu's BLOCK (oh yeah!) gave DLSU a 1 point victory over UP (SUCKERS!). That made my day happy, although my damn tutor had to come and ruin it. Wierd nga eh, napanood mo niyo na ba Austin Powers: Goldmember? Hehe, yung nunal ng tutor ko, parang si Number3. Although not THAT BIG, still the same BIG reaction. HAHAHAHAHA!!! *GUACAMOLE!!!*
