The clothes may be poor quality, and often ugly- the stores might have the atmosphere of a Chinese sweat-shop, but my real problem with Old Navy is the television advertisements blaring 24 hours a day.        An orgy of colour, beauty, and retardation   These ads seem to be formulaic.  You take a couple beautiful people, video tape them doing stupid things and make them smile.  You then throw in some weird progression of events and add a few unintelligible lines.  Worst of all Old Navy could probably show a video of a child cracking it's head off pavement and they would probably still see sales of their slave labour wares (yes, little hands do make little stitches).    Every-time I see one of these ads I change the channel- they are eerie, they make me loose faith in humanity-- and I think could even make me suicidal if my exposure was increased.  Old Navy commercials are pornography for christian-american-hillbillies, they project images of american stupefaction- and of the homogenization of culture in America.  There is also some real racial stereotyping going on-- you have to appeal to every "visible minority" and the formula for that is: 1 mulatto person, 1 asian person, with a variety of white people to interact with.  So to sum it up.... I hate these fucking ads!
