I watched this show religiously back in the 70s and 80s. It will be nice to finally see some new adventures on our TV screens soon. The special effects team also worked on the film  urlLink Gladiator , so the series will finally have some nice-looking special effects for a change. I do have to confess, though, that it will take some getting used to a Doctor who's ditched the old-fashioned clothes for a t-shirt and leather jacket!  Can a revival of  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000  be far behind?
