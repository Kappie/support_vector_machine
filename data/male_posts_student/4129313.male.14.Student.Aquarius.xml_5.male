First period we had a notebook check, but not all my notes were checked and I got 100 anyway. If I realy have that many notes, then I guess freshman year is gonna go bye quick seeing as I take so much notes I can pass anything I want.  As usual, I read all through second period, took awhile to snap back to reality when the buzzer rang to pass to next period.  Third period a friend of mine was arguing with the teacher about how to show his work. He's lucky he didn't get kicked out. He wasn't showing his work on his homework, claiming he can do the whole thing in his head, it may be true about the head thing but it is required to show all work on each problem in that class. Otherwise he would be accused of cheating. I did the same thing when I took 1A the second time, but then I just stoped doing homework all together, and at the end of the year I had to make up everything, with no extra credit.  Fourth period EVEN MORE students were put on seat restriction for having an F in either accademic or citizenship grades. At this rate I will be the only person in the back of the room by next friday. The seat restriction isn't doing much to help either, almost everybody in the class knows each other already, and are willing to talk to anyone. Cheating alone will take 50 out of 100 citizenship points, gum is 20, talking out of turn is 10, cursing is 20. They all know this, and still they continue to chew gum, speak out of turn, curse, and cheat. Hopefuly she will realize that this system isn't gonna get her anywhere and just send those fucktards to detention or something.  Fifth period we played hocky. (with an actual puck this time) Some asshat decided the team would benifit from me being goaly. Everybody knows by now that I can not hit, throw, run, jump, or block for shit. It ended up as a tie game, but I knew we could have won if somebody else was goaly. At the end of the period the idiot coach wouldn't unlock the doors and let us in to get dressed. I was 10 minuts late for lunch, and had to get to the back of the long line.  Lunch I again had a salad, with everything, turkey, a role, and ranch dressing. I don't know what it is, but I just can't stop coming back for more each day. I was caught trying to get 2 milks again, but this time I tryed to grab a chocolate and a white thinking it would be ok. It wasn't. They realy don't want me to quench my thirst do they? My friend came to the conclusion that my other friend's head looks like a dick head, because he shaved his head bald for ROTC. I started bustin up laughin right there on the spot. People thought we were crazy lol.  Sixth period we learned some new stuff. Reviewed some old stuff. We already knew that fahren means to ride, but with that conjugation thing it comes out as fahrt when coupled with a Ihr. Everybody busted up laughin when he said "Ihr fahrt ein fahrrad."  My front tire was flat again on the way home. I went to 7/11 to pump it up and met up with my friend Raul. He said he'd come over to my place tommorow on his bike. I told him to bring lots of water lol. I was going to burn him a copy of Halo, because some ass hole broke the other copy I made. It's only gonna cost 75 cents this time. I got home to find the shiter was cloged, my little bro playin NFS:U and my littler bro watching cartoons with his pants unziped and without a shirt. I flicked his ear to get his attention and told him "Zip up your pants and get a shirt on, your not a male striper." He's always trying to pull this shit, he's realy bulgy in the stomache area so his gut hangs over his belt. I realy hate it when he tryes to pull this shit, he looks like a fucking striping trucker who has just been forced to bathe.
