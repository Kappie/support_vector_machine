InfoWorld (in English), quotes Bernd Plank, a spokesman for Munich town hall, saying that he expected that the administration would take a maximum of 'two to three weeks' to decide whether the EU's Directive on software patents could affect the city's plan to switch to Linux, and that would be no 'dramatic setback.'"  -- www.slashdot.org  This is good news, that proves that Linux has a huge foot inside the German door of IT, thats good.
