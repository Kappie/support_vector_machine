Asked him what were the new cars he has seen recently . He replied "I am not crazy abour cars anymore , I am crazy only about Pokemon".                            Remember reading in the Newspapers sometime back that Pokemon is the latest craze among pre-teens . I have very little idea of what Pokemon is , but there is a lot we could infer from What age groups ---  do what , to learn about the emerging culture .
