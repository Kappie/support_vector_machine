Most of his friends were there and he had a fun lunch going out to lunch with Tina, Dottie, and Purdy among others.  It was fun and...well, it was just fun i guess.  Then since he does not have school the next day he went with Macaroon and his friend to Best Buy which was cool cuz he got Desperado/El Mariachi for like 8 bucks thanks to his Best Buy bucks he earned from McDonald's.  That was good.  Then he went back to Macaroon's house and played DDR2!  It was fun and there are some really cool songs on there.  They then went to McDonald's and GI Joes and then back to Tyke's place.  There they watched MNF and waited for Skippy and Karla to come over.  Tyronius decided to come over too so he did.  BUT...the person Tyke wanted most to come over did not.  Tyke called Tina when he was at McDonald's and she said she had basketball but she would call him afterwards.  As usual, she did not call him.  Maybe Tyke is too forgiving but he understood and sorta didn't expect her to call, even though he wanted her to and was disappointed when she didn't.  But he and the gang still watched Desperado and a good sex scene always lightens up a crowd.  But then everyone left and Tyke was left alone to do nothing but sleep.  So he did so.  But Tyke still wanted to hang out with Tina or at least talk to her again so he could try and get her to come to his game on Tuesday at Lake Sammamish Field 9 at 11 AM.  Yeah, that is kinda early but still.  Oh well, maybe she will come anyway.  Yeah, right...fat chance...HA! more like no chance.  Oh well.  Eh.
