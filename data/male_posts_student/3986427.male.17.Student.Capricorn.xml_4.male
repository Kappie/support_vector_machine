I already have an older iPod (2nd gen, 10gb) which I've used like every day for almost two years now. Anyways, the old iPod goes to my younger brother, who isn't as picky as I am when it comes to gadgets.  iPod pictures:   urlLink 1   urlLink 2     I also got a word from AppleCare today. They said my  urlLink PowerBook  has been sent to the Netherlands to get it's pixels anomalies fixed. The bump, however, is not likely to be fixed.    I sent my PowerBook to service the other day due to  urlLink pixel anomalies  in the LCD-display. The bump came after I slipped on ice like three days after I got it, and it will cost a lot to replace the part that's bumped (luckily no hardware was damaged). They said they would try to straighten it out, but it won't be good as new.
