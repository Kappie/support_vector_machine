They won in a last at bat stance by Paul LoDuca in the ninth inning. Woo... go Marlins.  I just sat around earlier in the day, until we went to home depot. We're making some kind of patio on the side of our house. 4 days till school. Im watching olympic basketball. Im tired. Goodnight.  I know, i know, Story of the Year twice in one post... but i only listened to them and Something Corporate today, and i really wasnt paying attention when i was playing SoCo, so i was more emotionally attached to SOY... yeah, whatever.  Sidewalks Story of the Year     The bridge is all crumbled. The water soaks into rocks that fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.) The town that we lived in. The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow  Over the sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. Or  Out on the front porch, watching the cars as they go by (Eighteen blue, twenty one grey) Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive, Out on our own, To speed away  From the sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. Or  All of the days have passed us by, All of the sun is gone... away.  Sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks, Running away from the streets we knew, Sidewalks, Like the time we thought was made for you. (Sidewalks) The bridges are crumpled, (Sidewalks) The water soaks into rocks, That fell at the bottom of the road.  I like this song so much. It doesnt really ahve to do with love, which is original, which i really like. Good music video material... original stuff... we'll see.  GOD SEND ME A SCHEDULE TOMMOROW!!!
