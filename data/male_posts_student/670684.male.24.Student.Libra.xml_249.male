I found the constant inspiration I'd been lacking since Centenary...I came here with questions, and leave with different questions.  And I'll miss another 37 kids.  I thought I had prepared better to deal with it, and it will be a little easier, which might not be fair to the kids here, but hey, it was just three weeks ago that I was experiencing the breaking of full-time bonds for the first time in years...I'm an old pro now.    I lost the last game of Mafia, and it was all my fault.  Kevyn, Dennis, and I were left, and I had earlier suspected Dennis of being in the Mafia, but lamented that I never truly knew when he was in it.  I waivered based on my own inhibitions, and voted against Kevyn, even though Dennis gave me ammo against himself.  Kevyn wasn't his usual self enough, though.    I'll miss trying to read Richard's face in Mafia.  Or Trevor's.  Or answer one of Adam Heart's questions.  Or give Boody a high-five.  Or suspect Wu of wrongdoings that I haven't seen, but it's obvious he was in the middle of.  Or ask Ryan about religion.  Or Ryan about TGIF or Texas.  Or Kieron about Angels In America.    I'm not sure if I know the girls here better than I knew the ones there.  It's tough...it's only been three weeks, but three weeks of constant bombardment with these people makes it easy to forget the conversations with the Laurens, or Jackies...now I focus on what Sarah or Ana or Liz or Katie Beth said to me today.    I think I did a good job.  I'm fair.  I don't expect things from them that I didn't do myself in camp.  They get in less trouble if I did it when I was a camper.  Granted, I was a damn good camper, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  Next year when I do this, if I teach, I will really miss this interaction.    I played Benny Mardones at the dance.  They liked him.  It's an incredible song.  Hopefully they'll think of TIP when they hear it again.  Same with Dirty Dancing's  I Had The Time Of My Life .  I did so many of the same things in high school that these kids are doing now...it makes me feel good about who I was.  The question is, am I becoming the person I have the potential to be?  I think this camp got me closer to that direction, not in terms of learning anything, but just a great inspirational reminder of how great things were, and that things can be that great now, even though I'm six years older.    As I played Tommy Rugden's  Bang On The Drum  for the last song, I wanted to dance with the kids.  In a way, I hoped one would ask me to dance...it wasn't slow dance, just a line dance as we sing  I don't want to work...I just want to bang on the drum all day!   We don't dance with students as policy, but I needed to be asked...I didn't want to be the old guy looking like he was trying to recapture youth.  Then I thought, maybe I'm not recapturing it...maybe I'm still young.  Why does 23 need to be old?  Inspiration and exeuberence tie together.    I'm ready to write the letter to the GDI kids now.  Too bad it's late and I need to be up in six hours, and I only got four hours of sleep last night.  WEET!
