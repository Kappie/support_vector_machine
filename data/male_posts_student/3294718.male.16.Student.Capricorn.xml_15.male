Houley has decided that for today he will be the helper mummy.  This one's short because I gotta go to bed. Don't laugh; my last two mornings were rise and shine at 5:30, pitiful for the last week of school. I'm just glad Travica's deadset on playing through his injuries tomorrow so I don't have to fill in and do the whole thing again. Why Alexandria? I'll tell you why NOT: 1) It's stupid. 2) It's got the worst weather of about anywhere, even like Neptune. 3) It's not even close to centrally located. We're playing  Bemidji  for crying out loud.  Which leads to my helping... To italicize, simply type what you want itaclicized, then highlight and push the slanty I at the top of the window. It'll surround your word with html... it works. Also, in blogger news, there's something very new about "Photoblogging." That oughta help. Lastly, Hawkeye oughta rock at Halo, especially if El Jefe did so well as he did on no previous playing experience.  As for my books, I've gotten into a sort of classic sci-fi rut of types. I've checked out a bunch of Heinlein, which I'm bound to read all day tomorrow, and looking for Vonnegut, who sounds really awesome. Fantasy was great, but George R. R. Martin's just not cutting it for me, don't ask me why. I'll still read Wheel of Time, of course. I'm morally and, in Massachusetts and Nevada, legally obligated to finish out the series, no matter how hard the man tries to light it up like the Hindenberg. It's just nice to be able to read for pleasure without APUSH crammed down my throat.  My most starkly conservative aspect is my overwhelming distaste for activist judges... or at least, that's the one that's come to mind.  Some trivia for you poor souls. Don't cheat, or you'll feel hollow. Don't tell anyone if you know the answer, or you'll contribute to their hollowness. I worked on this one many hours, but after solving it, it rewarded me with a sick sense of accomplishment like I've never felt in my life: What is the longest single-syllable word in the English language? To let you know when you're donesky, as well as to torture you further, the word is NINE (9) letters long. Best of luck.  And I'm spent.
