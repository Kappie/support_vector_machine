Research causes damage, since it's tiring, takes a lot of muscle use, and repetitive; sometimes you just fall into a routine... or into a bed of sea urchins, like I did two nights ago.  I was out collecting cryptic fish from tidepools at Resort Point in Palos Verdes Estates, CA, from midnight to about 8 am.  Needless to say, I didn't sleep for over 24 hours, but I'm still not sure how I went from squatting to having about 20 urchin spines in my hand and arm.  I spent about 45 minutes picking them out with a needle and tweezers.  It was great.  Then I went back to work, squatted down to grab more fish, and prompty fell backwards and slid down about 4 feet of rock, urchins, anemones and angry crabs.  At least I was wearing my Gorton's Fisherman gear, so I didn't get soaked when I fell in the tidepool.     Like my yellow bib?  I used to be the balance beam champion of kindergarten at Fairview, too... What happened to me?  (Answer:  I stopped doing things that require activity and I eat too much)  So yes, I'm a clutz, but apparently so is Sam (the new cat).  I'm not sure what the retard did, but he started limping around really hard last night, and still is a bit today.  I hope he just twisted an ankle (pawkle?) and didn't do anything serious, 'cause frankly I'm poor and can't afford vet bills.
