I politely tapped on the door and gestured for him to let me in. He flicked his hand signaling me to bugger off. Boy.... Nobody messes with me! I took a cab and told the driver to beat the 74 to the next bus stop. It had moved on pretty far so I ended up at the bus stop before sunset way. At the junction before that, the taxi stopped at the light and I paid the man $4, telling him that we wouldn't have time to complete the financial exchange later. At the bus stop, I thanked the nice taxi man and hopped out. Hailed the bugger's 74 and BOY OH BOY you should have seen his face when he saw me. I got on, slammed my wallet onto the reader, stood there staring at him, and after a long pause, said "hi".  I then walked over to my two very amused friends who'd seen what'd happened but didn't know how I got there that quick. Before I got off, I walked up to the old jerk, smiled contently, said "bye" and got off.   See, I handle difficult situations well don't I?
