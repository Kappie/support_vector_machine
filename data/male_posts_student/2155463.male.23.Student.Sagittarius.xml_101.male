I really had no idea what to expect, so it was a little like still being a volunteer (I did the filing run, etc.).  And I had to do a lot of exactly what I HATE to do most (i.e. waiting around and doing nothing) - sometimes I feel like a puppy when I get like that, where I walk around and investigate everything, then feel like laying down and going to sleep after I run out of things to do (which doesn't take very long).  Anyway, I finally started getting a feel for some of what I'm going to be doing towards the end of the day.  One of the really cool things is that I'll probably be asked to stand in on arraignments (where the client gets charged and a lawyer gets assigned) and do expungments, both things that will get me really involved with our clients (which is great!).  Aside from that, I'm still pretty much in the dark - I don't even know if they're going to be able to find me an office or cubicle with a computer and a phone! :(
