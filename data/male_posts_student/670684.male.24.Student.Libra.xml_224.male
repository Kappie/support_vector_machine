A few things I said at the bar that probably would be best left unsaid, but they involved others, so I'll throw it off as catty gossip and hope I never feel the repercussions.    I watched HIGH FIDELITY again (folks, as long as I'm on dial-up, you're not getting any links).  I was in Chicago when they filmed it, lived a mile from the area where it was shot, can tell you exactly what direction Cusack was facing every time he is on the El platform...and I didn't like the movie the first time.  Not at all.  Many friends came up to me and said it was going to be my kind of movie...an introspective look into personal psychoses, using music as a backdrop to life because music is the backdrop to life, at least it is in the movies.  I didn't get into it at all.  I didn't like the girl the movie hitched on...why get so attached to such a fruity bitch?  Cusack came off as overtly whiny, and in the end he gets back together with a girl that I never really felt any pathos for.  Go for the music reporter!    It wasn't so bad the last time.  Cusack was still happy to just complain, and I still don't like the chick, but I appriciate the search, and the silliness and folly of it, but the knowledge that he has to go on the search.    A girl  cheated  on me a few years ago...not in the grandest definition of the word, but enough to warrant speculation and get me upset.  In response, I got ahold of the girls I had dated to that point and asked them all if they had ever cheated on me...not to accuse, but to see why they did if they had.  None of them had.  In retrospect, I can see that writing a letter saying "Did you ever cheat on me?" is not the most strident way to extend friendliness with an ex, but I was a sensetive world-loving guy at the time who only really cared about himself (most of the world-lovers do, and it's a terrible realization), so how else did people live but in relation to me?  Anyway, I wasn't looking for answers...my mind was made up, and I just wanted to know if they agreed with my choice without telling them what my choice was...because the greatest thing about an ex-girlfriend is that honesty can abound in an exes relationship.    I don't think I'm looking for answers now either.  I'm not asking questions really.  John Cusack's problem was that he asked questions like why and what and how come.  No good can come from that, you just get saturated in the past, and your questions just become mechanisms of nostalgia and attempts at reconcillation.  Catherine Zeta-Jones isn't going to suddenly embrace him and they can move on from where they once were, listening to Anthrax and making the headboard buckle.  You can just watch, listen, see what is different, remember what it was before, try to track where they went, smile about it, enjoy the time, and wonder why their strengths seem to be your weaknesses.    Everyone needs to read a Richard Powers book.
