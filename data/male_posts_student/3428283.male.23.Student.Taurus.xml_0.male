In a war where 16 million Americans served and over 400,000 died, it is a wonder why it took so long for a memorial to be built for them. The Memorial honors not only those who died, but also those who survived, those who considered themselves "the lucky ones." While the importance of the National Memorial is not diminished by the passage of time, it does mean that many of those for whom the Memorial was built are no longer alive to see and receive the thanks of the nation. I can't help but wonder why it took so long for these veterans to be recognized, these men and women of, what Tom Brokaw terms it, "the Greatest Generation."
