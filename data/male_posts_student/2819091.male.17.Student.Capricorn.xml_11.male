How I constantly wish to be with her, she is so beautiful yet out of reach, all I can do is try to make friends with her; hoping that she will like me; hoping that she'll come near me; eternally hoping for a dream, a fantasy...  Wishing endlessly for a farfetched fantasy to come true.  Why can't I let go?  She is gone; I know that she has someone else in mind, someone who is her exact equal, someone who is beautiful...  Not someone as hideous as I.  Damn it...  Why can't I let go?  If only I could erase my memories, remove her from my mind, delete her whole existence out of my life, I will finally let her go...  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  Yes...  A new dawn that'll finally let me live my life as it were before I met her, meeting her was like a curse, a damnation in my life.  Her everlasting kindness that strengthened and brightened my day, the hugs that she gave me...  She was the only girl that ever shared the beautiful feeling of love and friendship with this hideous monster.  How beautiful this friendship was...  Though this monster knew it wouldn't last; the beautiful angel that graced her presence with the monstrosity was leaving.  Damn it...  The monster swore at the Fates for this predicament, the monster had become too well-adjusted with the angel that he couldn't bear to become alone all over again.  The angel would not do anything about it since she never knew about the monster's feelings for her that she left without thinking twice about her friendship with the monster.  The monster couldn't do anything anymore...  She had already left without saying goodbye.  Damn her kindness, her friendship...  The monster was alone all over again in this cold, barren wasteland without anyone that the monster could spend his entire life with.  Only loneliness...  Damn her.
