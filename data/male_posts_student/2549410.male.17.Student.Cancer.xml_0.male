       
      Since I've met you I've come to know, All the Feelings you've never shown, Your Senceless Smiles, Your Filthy Styles, Your firework kisses, Those things that I miss is, The things that I love, The things that I'd shove, Shove to you hard to keep them inside, Keep them and show them and never to hide, Your feelings for me as my feelings for you, Your feelings of joy the words of I love you, Changes now consume your soul, Changes Change but never more.
