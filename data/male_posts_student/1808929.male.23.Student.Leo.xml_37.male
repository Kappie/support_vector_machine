These last few days haven't been too eventful (studying and all), but one of the cool things is that I've made some connections to and between old friends.        I recently got a random IM message from Anup Shetty and I found out that he's in his first year of medical school at UT Southwestern in Dallas. This was really cool news. Anup Shetty and I knew of each other all through our time at Duke. Our last names were close to each other, we took a lot of the same pre-med classes, we were in the same freshman dorm and we had a lot of mutual friends, however, we didn't (and still don't) really know each other that well. Now that I'm in Fort Worth I've realized that there are just some occasions (namely basketball season) where you wish there were some other Duke people around, and who else is better than Anup? He's a real nice guy and he was even more of a Cameron crazy than I was. I'm going to have to get over to Southwestern sometime since there are now about 3 people I know over there.       I was chatting with Will McKnight last night. Will and I went through grade school together at Krum and we now both live here in Fort Worth. He said that he ran into and spent some time hanging out with Caleb Stone and Jeremy Villeneuve recently. Caleb and Jeremy were also friends of mine all those years at Krum, but I haven't seen or heard from them in 5 years. Will was also able to get a phone number for Tim Purnell. Tim was one of my best friends at Krum, but after he graduated from Krum I lost touch with him completely. See, this is what happens when I spend 4 years out of the state. Tim is married now and apparently lives in Sanger somewhere. I'm planning on contacting him sometime soon. How do you make that call though? "Hi, this is Doug. I haven't heard from you in 5 years. Sup?"       Finally, I just found out that one of my current TCOM classmates, Liz Rankin, knows Will McKnight from Austin College. She dated Will McKnight's roommate at some point while she was there. I wouldn't have figured there'd be a connection between the Krum and TCOM spheres of my life, but I guess there's only six degrees of separation between any one person and everyone else on the planet so I shouldn't be surprised.        Finally again, I found out that a Texas friend of mine is pregnant. I won't say whom, but she's already 5 months pregnant. It's been about 5 months since I've seen her also.        That's it. I've got to study now. This time around it's genetic disorders. Peace.    Songs of the day   Linger , Cranberries, 1993.   Ava Adore , Smashing Pumpkins, 1998.
