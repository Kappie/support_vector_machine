I'm not so sure if I prefer this template over my old one, but I'm willing to give it a shot.  I'm hoping to try out some of the new features, like the  comments  that can be posted by anyone who reads my Blog. Since my old Shoutbox seems to be out of commission, it's nice and convenient that this option has been added to the site.  Though I don't seem to be posting rants/glorious insights on a regular basis, I do tend to keep the information in the right column up to date.  Ciao!
