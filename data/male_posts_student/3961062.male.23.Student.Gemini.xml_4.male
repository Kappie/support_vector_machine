What frightens me is not so much his take on the new  urlLink movie  or its possible effects, but how he paints the Bush admin. as a utilizer of fear in order to maintain power. While I don't totally agree that the tactics Rich details are actually being used to the extent in which he details them, I do sense that Bush's campaign has adopted a more negative tone compared to 2000. That's not good, because I believe part of the reason Bush won in 2000 is because he took the high ground in thecampaign and didn't allow himself to be pulled into mudslinging. Yesterday I saw a Bushad on FNC that was basically a bash of Kerry. Fine. I'm just concerned that this stuff won't work. W is known for being steadfast, fornot letting his opponents fluster him, but negativity shows that you've been irritated. Perhaps I'm over-reacting to one ad and this op-ed, but I think in a campaign based on fear and negativity, the Demos win every time. After all, they're the masters at crises-based demagoguery. Bush needs to take the high road, or he's going to soonbe joining pop on the golf course.
