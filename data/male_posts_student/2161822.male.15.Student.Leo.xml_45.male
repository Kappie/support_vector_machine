You know what I hate. Memorizing things. And having to recite it. I'm really not good at it, but that's life. So I'm thinking Wednsday is gonna be interesting. The whole situation isn't fair at all, and I need to think of something to get back at you with. Too much that you know about me...you don't win though. We'll see. I guess you're in my blog now. I hope you feel special.  Listen to H.I.M.
