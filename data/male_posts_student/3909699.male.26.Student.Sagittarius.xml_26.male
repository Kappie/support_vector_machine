I'm supposed to keep moving, but the temptation to just stop for a bit is massive. The place where I've come to rest is  urlLink Fr. John Stather 's house in Colchester, a 4-bed semi on the Roman Road that he gets rent- and tax-free for being deacon of St. James'. I have the room in the loft. On my way out of Copenhagen I saw two funny storefronts. One of the batteries had fallen out of my camera and I couldn't find it, so I have no evidence of this, but I saw one store called BIGE KÃ˜KKEN, which was funny enough until I saw a ladies' fashion boutique called SLUTSPURT. My plane was delayed so I didn't get into Colchester until nearly one in the morning, and then obviously had to sit around for another hour eating leftover Thai food (the Colchester variety being somewhat shitter than the Sydney standard), while John procrastinated over writing his Sunday sermon. John is much the same as he was when we were up at Durham, I guess. He still survives on very little sleep. I was really surprised five days ago passing through here at how tidy and civilised the house is - John's room in Shoichi was a complete tip, trash strewn everywhere, with a pungent male odour. I surmised that possibly John had actually cleaned up in anticipation of my visit, which hypthesis is borne out somewhat by the fact that the place is now far more entropic. Also, there's a hell of a lot more space to absorb John's spread.     Fr. John's vicarage (actual size) * *Turns out 'slutspurt' actually means like closing down sale. Humph.
