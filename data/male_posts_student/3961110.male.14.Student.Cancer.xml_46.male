The result is 31.3 seconds of pure kantana action :) At 24 fps, this little flick is rocking, with kantanas, dai-kanatanas, throwing knifes, shrunkiens(might remove this later on), short swords and axes mixing with blood and little dudes. Theres like 24+ layers, so I had to switch resolution to 1280x1024 to get more stuff on screen. I will post a screenie later.   I wonder how Beckett is getting on with the site? Also, I have decided to have a full forum (invision prob), and I also putt Tull in charge. I also advice him to look at  urlLink this skin resource site . Its pretty l33t for Invision boards :) James better start to create some stuff in Flash, his wee exuse of no access resources is rubbish >:|  I produce 0% resource content Flash, with 100% of my own work, all drawn inside Flash.   Have to go to work tomorrow, must earn cash for l33t hockey stick and mp3 player.   Have fun the rest of you,   Jamie  ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
