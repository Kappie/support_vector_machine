Hmm...good work!  Okay...after studying these chapters in the morning, I went online to wait for the return of Father. We are going out today afternoon ma. Meow meow meow!! I mainly checked my mail and read forums.  Father came back at 11, and we went off. First, my mom went to Ang Mo Kio to buy incense and other peripherals for praying. Stocking up, supplies were low. Then, we went to Balestier Road to eat the chicken rice from some famous store.  Woah! The rice taste super! Oh! The chicken meat too!! Sumptous! So tender and smooth! The chicken parts...hmm!! The fish head in some sauce is nice too! And you know what? While eating, we saw some celebrities walked past. Jack Neo, Mark Lee and the Chen Jianbing. The actors from the Comedy Night lor. Woah! Everyone was staring at them as they walked past. Me-ow meow!   After the fulling lunch, we went to the Popular in Toa Payoh. I wanted to buy a SS assessment guide. Ayiah! They don't stock it there. But, I found a great find! Charmed story books! Lots and lots of them! YaY!! I got three books! Date With Death, Gypsy Enchantment and Between Worlds (the one which I wanted yesterday! YaY!!). Meow meow meow!  Then, my parents fetched my brother home. We (the three of us) went to Causeway Point to check out the Popular for my book. The parents went to deal with their CPF whatsoever, and I went to Popular.  As again, nothing. Sigh! My luck! While waiting for my parents to come up after their CPF business, I read the SAT and PSAT guide book. Woah! The English section is damn easy man! All primary school stuff! Meow meow meow! I had so much fun doing the exercises.   Okay..after a while parents came. We went to Courts to pay bills. I brought a CD-holder there! So cute and innovative! We then went to Shell to pump diesel, then returned home. I played a couple of games before going to eat dinner.  We ate dinner at 768. Then, I went home to watch Holland V. Woah! Today Su Hao told LingLing his feelings towards her. So sweet! LingLing rejected...because she's not ready. Please be ready!! Everybody wants them together! And hor, hahaha!! Good for LingLing! She kicked TianCheng in the face! YaY!! And tomorrow, Ying TianCheng is gonna die by being struck by lightning. I thought he's gonna drown. Whatever. He dies! YaY! AFter that, watch TV lor.  I gotta go le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.
