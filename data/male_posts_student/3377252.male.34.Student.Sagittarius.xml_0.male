It is not totally explicit in these works, but it is my opinion that our "founding fathers" already believed the churches at the time did in fact had many Christians because their membership in the body was not based upon works of men but one man and God, Jesus Christ.  It was their hope (I would like to imagine prayer as well) unity can be achieved by tearing down those man-made barriers which supposedly divide us.  I am reminded of a verse, I know it is out of context and my ACU professors would cringe at I taking such liberties, but there is freedom in Christ so here it goes:       MT 19:4 "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator `made them male and female,' 5 and said, `For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh' ? 6 So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."  I Know, I know it is about marriage but the church is made whole by the sacrifice of Christ, what is it about us that thinks we can do anything to separate what God has joined together.  I don't know the knots which God ties are pretty tight and complicated for someone like I to untangle.
