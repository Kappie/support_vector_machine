ZuluChim: hey-ness Pharsalus8948: is that like what a horse says while he's eating with a long face at a bar? ZuluChim: very much like that           That was a bit random. I need to post a story that I've written, but it is very long and I don't want to post it all at once. After I post this blog, i will post one portion of my story, then so on and so forth.
