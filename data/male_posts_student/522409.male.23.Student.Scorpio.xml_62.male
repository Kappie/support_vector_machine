A week from today, I'm jumping out of a perfectly functional plane at 13,000 feet with Jess.  So much symbolism, so little literal translation.  At least she's made mention of it.  That's got to be good, right?  Or at least not bad?  What's important is she's thinking about it.  Oh, you thought I was talking about the Jess/skydiving thing?  The old jazz song was wrong.  It's not spring, but summer that can really hang you up the most.  Or at least for me.  Part of my world goes on pause while I spend three months 100 miles from Boston in a place that may as well not exist the other 9 months out of the year.  So strange... people, places, feelings, that can never be duplicated or fully explained outside the context of the Cape.    I hardly ever notice the part of my world that goes on pause for the summer.  I mean, I notice, but I don't worry about it, until this year.  This year, in the months before hitting pause, important and cautious developments happened.  I wish I'd had one more month before suspending it all in midair.    Maybe I don't need to wish things were different.  They're all as they should be, or so the theory goes.  How to accept that, though, when it seems like there's more that can be done?  I'm oversharing because it's late.    I got your "goodnight" IM tonight... missed you by a minute or so.  That's always the way, but that's no matter.  We'll talk soon enough.  Theme party in 4 days.  4 days?  And me with nothing but my mixers purchased.    Goodnight.
