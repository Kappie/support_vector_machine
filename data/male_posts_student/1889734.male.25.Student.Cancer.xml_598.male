Took me awhile, only because I could not "skim read" like I usually do, I had to actually read every word so as not to miss any of the subtleties of it.  I was impressed.  A book that held up to the hype.  The way that Herbert gave you information, without seeming to give information was astounding.  He would drop numerous references in dialogue that were major points of action of a character, but not reveal the actual MEANING of the reference for 200 pages, yet he did it without frustrating me.  I have thought about this for days, and I can't figure out how exactly he did it.  Maybe because the background was so alien yet so similar, I found I didn't WANT to know everything about everything, I liked the mystical mystery.  During every traditional action plot point that was resolved, there was also a resolution of minor background and character motivation points as well.    In all, I would say the most impressive example of how to tell without telling, how to tell JUST enough and how to weave together an amazing amounts of intricate plot points with each other.  I think, and I think this is true of all Sci-Fi/Fantasy, it all starts with such a detailed, well thought out and plausible universe.  I could tell that Herbert probably had tons of volumes of writings, notes and prep work to build the universe that never even made it into the book, or were only casually mentioned.    The ONLY major issue I had, was the ability of the elder Liet to sway the Fremen and find a place among them, when it was obvious from Paul and Jessica's interaction that that was next to impossible.  Somehow, the Liet's were seen as ultra-powerful, yet not a threat to an individual sietch like Paul was.  Also, was Liet ever considered part of a Prophecy, like Paul, which I think was a major reason he was allowed to live.  Herbert tries to smooth that point over with an epilogue describing the elder Liet's introduction into the Fremen society, and his ability to introduce his ideas and radically alter the Fremen existence, but it was still a bit weak to me.    I would recommend this book, re-read it if you have read it before.  Todd, it is applicable to your work for his ability to hold meetings and conversation that didn't seem there just to pass information.  I am tempted to dive into the further works of Dune, but am leery if only because I think maybe it's best to just wonder, I may be disappointed with the literal answers (ala, The Force in Star Wars!).  What do you guys think, should I continue to read more Dune?  I'm also going to watch the movie again, though I will be getting it from the library, God save my soul.
