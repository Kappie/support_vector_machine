Reason 1:  VIP suddenly seemed the right programme for me after the briefing on the system of learning and the style of education. I also found some of the rooms quite cool. The system sounds so unique and unlike the normal curriculum   Reason 2:  The teachers gave us a surprise. We went there, surprised to find Mr Koh as one of the organisers, and Mrs Jay and Mrs Lai advocating the subjects of literature and math. Life in VS GEP would be not as lively without these teachers that have taught me.   Brief Program that day.  8:30 am to 9 am:  Registration and collection of handouts 9 to 10 am:  Talk by Mrs Chan and Key Personnel on VIP Curriculum and admission procedures 10 am to 12 noon:  Open House.  An opportunity to have lesson previews, interact with teachers teaching VIP etc.  Actually I also met a few of my friends, about 4 from Dunman and 1 from Nanyang.
