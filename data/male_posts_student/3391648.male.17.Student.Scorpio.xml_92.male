We are going to still keep these serious discussions, but need your help in sexing m3r, up so to speak. Submit your suggestions for making m3r more interesting. I think what m3r needs to do is apply its philosophy more. Soon we will be postering the school to a greater extent and we aim to take greater control over the school environment in this way. I think people should be reporting to m3r the discrimination and problems they have faced at school from students and staff. This will go along way towards making m3r a more interesting and more useful website. Your submissions for posters to do with any issue are welcome too. Thanks.
