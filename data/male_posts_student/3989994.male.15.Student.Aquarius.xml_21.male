It hurts no one. Sometimes you look deeper and you realise, people change. You cannot stop it, you can only stand and watch. There are those whom you liked for what they were, when change happens to fast or you are suddenly shakened, and wake to a totally different person, you are left to stand and wonder why?  A person is liked or admired for his qualities but not only is it just that, unknowingly you make certain bonds, links with that perosn and you cannot alter that, when he/she changes and suddenly drives you away more often then not u are left hurt and broken. People are the what makes most things live. Simple words could bring a depressed man away from the buildings edge, but those same words could stab a man so badly he rather die then fight to live.  A person broken by another is a person no longer. He becomes an empty shell, with mind but no love, no feelings, no emotions, the anithesis of passion he becomes more than dead. For what good is living without actually enjoying the bliss, not feeling the pain, to live is for a greter purpose never just to amble through life and do nothing.  Every person, every body has done something for the rest of us, for himself except perhaps he may have done in a small way, you not proof gravity, heal the sick or donate millions to charity. The simple words or a kind gesture of understanding of believe or inspiration or the life you lead yourself can change a person heart or his destiny. If you chose not to live do not obstruct anothers way, let him breathe and be exulted by the change from sky blue to the black of velvet.  A persons words can drive through anothers heart, thing before you say, some words may seam sharp but pierce only the skin but the simplest words or actions are usaully the most hateful. Without hate there is no love, and without love there can be no life, it slips past your fingers but that feeling of love is forever, the most stoned person would be melted to feel love. The things we cannot understand is usually the greatest of things. We were not meant to understand all.  The general believe would make out the world to sound in choas but i know that it is not true. After all when the soldiers were going to war and knew they would likely not return did they make calls of hatred and revenge? I believe it were all messages of love.  Let love rest in your heart,  love to you all,
