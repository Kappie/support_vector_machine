Anyway, taking my trombone into Secondwind tomorrow, Ian Brown is going to sort out the buggered-up slide and make it less up-buggered. Then I've got to do my paper round, then I'm off to Tom's for a band practice. Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? Then we wouldn't have to wait as long...  Laura's in Devon... *raps fingers on desk* She's fun to talk to. Not that other people aren't... it's just conversation topics have run out. With Laura I can go over ones I've used before, because I haven't actually done them with her. And if worst comes to worst I could have an interesting conversation about drugs, like I did before with Saz. That was strange.  This is a strange thing to say, but still... my hair feels really nice today. You know how sometimes your hair is crap? Well, mine isn't. It's really soft and manageable, and... don't let me be a hairdresser. Don't let me say things like that again. HELP!  I spent a lot of today playing FFX. Tidus is doing 99,999 a hit... git. Auron's only doing 50,000. Well, when he's at 6,000 health he does 99,999. It's unfair that he has to LOSE health to do more damage. ...I just realised half the people who read this (ie. Scott and Miller, the other half bein... alright, everyone who reads this) won't understand it, but still, you know the basic concept. Argh, buggeryfalloockle. That's the one.  I have a strange urge to write a lot. This urge is not aided by the fact I have nothing to talk about. I'll quit while I'm only marginally behind.  Quote of the day: "It's a greif that can't be spoken. It's a pain, goes on and on. Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone."  From Boubil and Schonberg's   Empty Chairs at Empty Tables   from the musical   Les Mis√©rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
