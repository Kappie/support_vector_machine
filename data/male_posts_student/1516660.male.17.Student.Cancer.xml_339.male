The host, Billy Crystal, is terribly funny! HAHAHA! Hmmm...The LOTR: ROTK dominated the whole Oscars awards. I mean, winning all 11 nominations! By the 5th win, I got so bored at ROTK's monopoly of the award show. Heh. Even Billy Crystal was meowing at Oprah! Heh Heh Heh. Of course, I was online too. I keep running here and there during commercials. :)  Hmm. Mother brought lunch back home (she went cousin-visitng). Hmm. Such delicious BBQ chicken from Admiralty Place. Moo! After the Academy Awards, I went online and then went out lor. Actually, I was kinda late because I was choosing my t-shirt. So little selection!! Anyway, HM was there only.  HaHa. Did I mentioned that Mrs Chew called me in the morning? She accidentally called mah father and she said "wrong number" when she realized that it was not me on the line. HAHA! She told me she's only free on 2.30. Heh. We waited till 2.30 for all the cats (quite a whole lot) to arrive. Meow moo.  Hmm. HaHa. A teacher came and bring Mrs Chew down. HaHa! Chew!! The first thing she asked is our science grades. She was rather pleased with us, most of us got As. :D Hmm. She treated us all to drinks. Coolies! We chatted a lot, about her school (EVG is kinda hard...she had to shout at the lower sec...oh my. Naughty kidlets), about us. HaHa. I passed XC's message to her "tell her meow and say thank you". HAHA! She said "oh! I got so many meows!". What a fun teacher! We chatted till about 3+, when she has to do her work. Me and KentKent went home.  Hmm. I went home, bathed and came online. Ayiah..I was deciding whether or not to put Poly courses in my choices, ya know, to be my safety net. XC told me to just put PJ and YJ. 12 points sure get into PJ de. HaHa. Yeah. Only these choices. Tomorrow register. Heh Heh. Wendy invited me to play MahJong, but I didn't go in the end. Father don't allow. Sigh.   At 6, we went for dinner. Dad wanted to tell me MaMa's leg was amputated today. He used the Cantonese for cut, "Kort". I heard it as "kquack", which means died in Cantonese. I was like "Oh my god! Oh my god!" My father was like "Why are you freaking out over the leg being cut?" I felt so embarassed I misheard a word. Heh. Anyway, I meowed at my dinner.  I came back and went online lor. Hmm. What do I have to add? Er...nothing? Then I go off le. Heh. I am rewatching the Oscars, mainly see Billy Crystal's hosting. Heh Heh. Funny guy. Okie. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
