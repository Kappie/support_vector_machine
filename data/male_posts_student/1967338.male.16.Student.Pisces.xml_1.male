Big office towers, huge shopping malls, even some luxury condos. I figured this orginization had to be something big.  As I neared the address, I stopped the cab and paid the driver. Not exactly a small thing. Cabs aren't getting any cheaper. I sighed and handed over more than half the money in my wallet. When I turned around, purse on my shoulder and small duffel bag in my hand, I saw thatI was in front of 1429 Dunhill. I continued down the street, staring up at the tall buidings that surrounded her. 1431, 1433, 1435... I stopped in front of number 1437 and blinked. Twice. Then did a double take. Number 1437 Dunhill was a number on a stick. And not one of those fancy plaques either. No, it was a piece or wod with the numbers "1,4,3,7" written on in permanent marker. Ok, I thought, now what? After I had finished oggling at the wood on a stick, I realized that behind the sick, there was an alley. A dark, spooky, wet alley. Great, I thought, I'm going to ruin my shoes. Now, before you say, 'Why is she thinking about her shoes? She's about to go on a wild and exciting adventure!' You must realize that these were very good shoes. We're talking, a 600 dollar pair of shoes (that I got on sale for $150) that would now be ruined because of a stupid mission. Oh well, what the heck? Toward the middle of the alley, there was a small door, rusty, metal door. I started towards, it but didn't get more that three steps before I heard a splash behind a dumpster right in front of me. Immediately, I tensed up. Being a single girl, I had invested in self defence classes. I put my bag down on a semi-dry patch of concrete.  No sooner had I turned than someone jumped out at me. A man dresed in black, ninja-style. How original. I made short work of him. A swift kick in the groin took care of him. As he lay on the ground, I wacked him on the back of the head, causing him to lose conciousness. Another guy tried to sneak up on me, but sonn he was lying beside his friend. The third man was a little more difficult. He actually knew a little bit about martial arts. He attacked me from the side, hitting me hard. As I lay on the ground, the wind knocked out of me, he stood back and did the whole, macho deal. Unforetunately for him, he forgot I was lying within kicking distance. Bye bye number three. I picked up my bag, satisfied that no one else was going to attack me, and headed for the door. AS I openned the door, I heard someone from inside say, "Very good, Ms Taylor. Please step inside." I stepped into an ankle-deep puddle.  Bye-bye $600 shoes.
