But, I need to heed my own advice that I pass to others as if I am an old-wise man. I was telling a friend that so far in history; anarchism, marxism and other leftist ideologies have failed to provide a philosophy of life which religion hasdone rather well. Although I have found a philosophy of life that has given me meaning, I know how easily it can be buried in the mounting importance of the political change that this world needs. I cannot lose myself in the political world as I did before...    I saw Big Fish and it reminded me how someone's philosophy of life can change their whole life.
