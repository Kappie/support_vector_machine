Usualy it's either my music collection that I have downloaded or I listen to the radio station "Technicolor Web of Sound" on iTunes, under the classic rock arrow. Here is a list of good songs I've written down over the past few days that somehow I'm going to get.  Tommy James and the Shondells - Crimson and Clover, Cellophane Symphony Ant Trip Ceremony - Outskirts Fat Mattress - Iridescent Butterfly The Syn - 14-Hour Technicolous Dream The Open Mind - The Magic Potion Rameses and Selket - In My Mind's Eye Orpheus - The Dream The Orange Swirl Society - The Fourth Pipe Neil Young and Crazy Horse - Cinnamon Girl Ill Wind - Full Cycle Nazz - Take the Hand Apple - The Otherside Mighty Baby - House Without Windows July - My Clown The jimmy Hendrix Experience - Third Stone From the Sun Kak - Trieulogy: Golgotha, /Mirage/rain The Blues Project - Flute Thing Traffic - Many a Mile to Freedom The Excelsior Spring - It dDonovan - Lalena James Gang - Tend my Garden Christopher - Beautiful Lady Vanilla Fudge - You Keep me Hangin' on
