    
        Res ipsa loquitur  basically means that if something in your possession hurts another person, and you don't have a good reason for it, you're negligent.   Wilson v. Spencer  summed it up nicely: "Thousands of automobiles are using our streets, but no one expects the air to be filled with flying hubcaps."  And I, for some strange and twisted reason, cracked up at the imagery. Does anyone else find it hilarious?
