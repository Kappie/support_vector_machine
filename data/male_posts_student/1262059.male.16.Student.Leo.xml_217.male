Finally deciding on a good plan of action, she picked up Hinotama's clothing, flooded them neatly and walked down the stairs in order to speak with the inn keepers. The man of the house gave her a stern look as she neared the kitchen. His wife and daughters huddled against a corner, the mother wrapping her amrs defensively around her children with a look of horror.  Haruka's cloudy eyes looked at them with indifference.  "Don't cause anymore trouble to our family!" the father suddenly yelled, his eyes filling with what seemed to be tears.  "What happened?" Haruka asked, her mind going over the images she saw of Hinotama being carried along. Who was that other young woman with them...?  "My eldest daughter! They took her dammit! Now leave my house!" he roared, throwing a pot at Haruka. Before it could hit her, she caught it with closed eyes.  "My apologies, I'll leave now," she said softly as she placed down the pot, "but I request one thing..."   Hinotama lowered her head as she entered the inn, knowing that in tradition she was not allowed to raise her head to the men. None the less, Hinotama had her ways to see around and marked every fine wooden corridor, classical paintings and every face of high class that held a weapon or too. The hallways weren't very crowded, so the men who handled her often took turns pinhcing her ass when Saro wasn't looking; Hinotama kept that in mind with a grin. Although all things were going as planned, she had hardly expected the inn keepers' daughter to be stolen. Hinotama glanced at the girl who whimpered with every step; the poor girl would be shared amoung many.   Hinotama suddenly fell to the ground in a great cry, startling everyone in her accompiment through the hallway.  Saro, startled more then any other, asked harshly as he hit Hinotama gently, "What the hell is your problem??"  "I am shamed! I do not know if I can face him!" she cried dramatically, tears pouring from her huge eyes.  "Get up bitch!" another man cried.  "I beg of you," she said with a sob, "allow me to take the girl with me! I do not want to go alone!"  There was a uproar with the men, all crying their protests. The girl, her skirts flustered and hair undone in a messy heap of black hair, widened her slender eyes in surprise and potential hope.  Saro, obviously stressed and wanting to get moving, pulled Hinotama to her feet roughly and pushed her forward.   "Not a chance, she's ours," he announced flatly, and the men gave out a gentle cry of excitement.   The girl sobbed once more, looked to Hinotama desperately and was then taken away.   Hinotama stared after her for the only moments she had left to before she was pushed in front of a screen door with a dim light burning behind it.   She lowered her head to the floor and pushed her kimono ends underneth her knees. Saro tapped lightly, being the only man left to escort Hinotama, and awaited to hear the voice of his lord.   A high pitched voice replied, that was none the less confident and relaxed. "Tell me what became of the strangers, Saro."  "They have vanished, my lord Seishuu, but left a gift for you and their deepest aplogies," Saro replied, sweat beeding down his forhead.  The candles flickered againt the paper door, causing odd releftions that appeared demon-like to dance along it's surface. Moments of silence seemed to take forever to pass, as Saro waited to see if his lord was upset, or pleased.  "Before I lecture you on letting them get away, tell me, Saro, what is this gift?"   Saro swallowed in relief, lowering his head and mumbling, "Just allow me to show you, my lord, and I'm sure you'll be pleased."  "Very well, come in," Seishuu commanded with a hint of agrivation.  Hinotama crawled on her knees into the room, and when told, looked up to the man Seishuu. He was old, very old, lines of age creasing even his bald forhead. Eyes like bottomless pits stared from where he sat on a sleeping mat and behind him, Hinotama could see three figures lying within the sheets. The room stunk of sweat and...other things, but she managed to compose herself easily enough as Seishuu's eyes searched over her longingly. It was Hinotama's time to shine.
