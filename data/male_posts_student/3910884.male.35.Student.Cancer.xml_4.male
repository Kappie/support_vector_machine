They in turn took the PHP 2,700 each and split it up among friends and family members they knew they could trust in regards to paying back the microloans.    The responsibility is shared among the 10 tribal council members and reduces the chances that one person (or group) would monopolize the funds usage and allows self-monitoring of the tribal council. Most of the money went to farmers who grow rice and have already developed a long-term (6-month goal) by either:  1) selling ready-to-cook rice which takes some time but fetches a higher price,  2) selling the rice seeds to other farmers.    Those who borrowed PHP 1,000 are expecting to make PHP 400 at the end of the 6-month project.
