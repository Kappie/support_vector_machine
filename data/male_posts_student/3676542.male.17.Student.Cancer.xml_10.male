Well ,this job earn not much.Each print of umbrella,only bout few cents.Got to print a large quantites to earn more.Problem is time contraint,and not enough labour.This is quite a labour intensive work.Cos no machines are you.Or got,but should say it's tool.From unpackaging,to printing,to drying,to packaging,all done manaually..It's a hard work..Not many pple know how the logo is printed.Not by machines,do mananually using tools..Hard work eh..  Considering  that this job earn very little,my aunt still give me quite alot for doing the job.Take the money,mother sure give me a nagging session,say my aunt they all earn not much,den give me can consider alot..Not i want de oso.my aunt keep pushing the money and ask me keep.  Today  a bit careless,cut hand with a penknife when unpackaging..nvm,unlucky,I used to it.Since younger.Wat to do,born to be a unlucky person.    As  I was walking home from interchange,I used the time to think of her,infact,I'm still thinking of her.Miss her especially during the nite,before I fell asleep.It gets so lonely..She just keep appearing in my mind..Can't help it to think of her.  I  hate the feeling of missing her,hate the feeling when seeing her and him being so intimately infront of me,hate being lonely thru the nite.  I  hate her,hate her for letting me loving her so deeply.   Did  I love the wrong person?  Am  I stupid for single-sided love everytime  Should  I get in between them or Should I give up and sliently wish them all the best?  No  need guess the answer,I always choose latter.  But  for now,i dunno the answer,I love her too deeply.  Why  I'm always the fool.
