But alas! Duane decided for some reason to make himself completely inaccesable all afternoon, not picking up his home phone or cell phone, or responding to IMs. Lyle, while reachable, decided that he had to spend his afternoon studying for the SAT’s. Needless to say, we were quite annoyed, and pissed away several hours playing Red Faction in Andy’s basement. Becoming bored after a while, we decided to check in again with our erstwhile friends and attempt to resuscitate the Ultrazone plan. And voila! Lyle had finished with his SAT prep and was ready to go along with us. Duane, however, was still unreachable, so we decided to just proceed with our plan without him. On the way to Lyle’s house, Andy asked me to call Duane (who lived nearby) in a last-ditch attempt to reach him.   “Hello?”, said a deep male voice on the other end of the line.  “HELLO,” I shouted over the loud road noise outside. “IS THIS DUANE?”  “No, this is [insert Duane’s father’s name here].”  “IS DUANE THERE?”  “I’m not sure,” he responded. “Hold on.”  I informed Andy of the response that I got. He chuckled. A few minutes later, another deep male voice came to the phone. “Hello?”  “HELLO,” I wasn’t sure at this point whether or not I was speaking to Duane or his father. We traded a few hellos before I asked, “IS THIS DUANE?”  “Yes,” he responded.  “THIS IS FORREST. WE’RE ON THE WAY TO YOUR HOUSE. WE’RE TAKING YOU TO ULTRAZONE. WE’LL BE THERE IN A FEW MINUTES.”  “I can’t do it.”  “WHY?”  “I’m hanging out with someone.” I informed Andy of this response.  “Tell him he can bring his friend,” Andy instructed. I did so.  “It’s a lady friend,” Duane said quietly. Again, I told Andy this.  “Who is it?” Andy asked. I (who was by this point only an intermediary between Andy and Duane) conveyed this question.  “Someone,” he said. I told Andy this and he told me to ask him again. I did, and got the same answer. Andy then went on a loud obsenity-laden tirade into the phone that I was pointing in his general direction. I put the phone back to my ear to hear how Duane responded, which was by calling Andy some ass-related thing (possibly an ass-sucker, I’m not really sure.) Andy told me that in order to know how serious it was, he needed to know a cup size. I told Duane best wishes and hung up before he said goodbye. It was hands-down the strangest phone conversation I have ever had. Andy subsequently yelled at me for hanging up before ascertaining the cup size of Duane’s lady friend.
