Life , meaning of live has never really been found out.   Though  some thought they already knew the answer.   Or  should I say, everyone has a different opinion/meaning/reasoning for wat life is..   To  me, life, something which is so special that I can't really understand it.   Why  different people got different life?   It's  a mystery..      I  appeared to be happy at all times, maybe.   But  not all times..   When  i'm thinking bout something,   I'll  look sad, but dun worry..   I  wont be sad, or even sad for long..   For  I know that I'm consider much fortunate then many in the world.   Happiness , something that everyone should have.   I  don't wish to be sad all times, even though it hurt sometime..   I  want everyone to be happy   Especially  her..   I  want to spread what ever happiness I can give to anyone i know.  Or even pple i dun really know..   Smile  always everyone..   Sun  will always rise..   Rain  will definitely go..   Autumn  came, and it's time for romance..
