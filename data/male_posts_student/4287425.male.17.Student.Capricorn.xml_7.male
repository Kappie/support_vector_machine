I only had my doubts since the last time i made a web page i updated it twice and left it on the web for about 3 years.  Actually it might still be around...   I got so many damn complaints, saying "Hey man, update your page". And i'd just tell them to bugger off, since i'd be busy doing things that didn't suck instead.  Ahhh...i love being bitter.
