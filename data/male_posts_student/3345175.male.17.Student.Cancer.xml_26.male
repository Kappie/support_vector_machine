There was nothing wrong, as far as i knew, but i wouldnt be surprised. He didnt do anything wrong, and we'd had a fantastic afternoon. But i sat last night and just cried. For no reason. And people who know me know i dont cry. I can get a bit teary, sure, and i can be crying inside, but it doesnt happen too often on the outside. There was no reason for it that i could see.  It's probably just that i've been feeling really *wrong* these past few days. I seriously keep feeling something bad is going to happen, soon, but i dont know what it is or if anything's gonna happen at all. But i just cried. I sat with my legs up on the couch, shivvering (it wasnt particularly cold), feeling as though i was going to choke, and just cried silently into myself. And it's really worrying me now.  On top of that, i just turned down an afternoon with David, which i totally wouldnt ever do. I was gonna go to his house for a while, and then we were gonna go shoe-shopping with Nicola in Hamilton. And i bloody turned the invitation down. Everything so far with him has been just about perfect - why would i wanna not go?! I've let go of my insecurities and everything. I mean, he wants to be with me right now, and i wanna be with him, and ive accepted it all. It doesnt seem so much like a dream anymore. But i still have this feeling that i've screwed it by the way i acted yesterday at his house, which it'll turn out i didnt. But what am i to expect when i have all this baggage from rejection and being used for sex? Stupid fucking guys! They screw you over when you're seeing them, and then when you finally find the really good one the walls they built are still in the way.  I really dont know what to do, and im having whole periods of non-David related thought (for the first time in a while :P). It's not that im going off him in the slightest: not at all, im just worried. Im worried about how ill screw this one up too and im worried about what this big, bad-thingy is thats gonna come and leave a bunch of people in pain. It would just be so typical that i'm this happy with someone, and then i let something like my fears get in the way, or somebody kills one of us.  That's irony for you. Oh isnt life just a hoot and a half?   Need to go to the library for mother, need to post thingy for my Â£450. What an eventful day im gonna have. Why oh why did i jst reject that invitation?!       You say i only hear what i want to. You say i talk so all the time so.  And i thought what i felt was simple, And i thought that i dont belong. And now that i am leaving Now I know that i did something wrong coz i missed you.  You say i only hear what i want to. I dont listen hard, dont pay attention to the distance that you're running To anyone, anywhere. I dont understand if you really care Im only hearing negatives: no, no, no.  So i turn the radio on, i turn the radio up And this woman was singing my song Lover's in love, and the other runs away. Lover is crying coz the other wont stay.  Some bodies hover as we weep for the other  Who was dying since the day they were born Well this is not that: I think that im throwing but im thrown.  I thought id live forever, but now im not so sure You try to tell me that im clever But that wont take me anyhow or anywhere with you.  You said that i was naive When i thought i was strong I thought "Hey, I can leave, i can leave" But now i know that i was wrong, coz i missed you.  You said, "you caught me coz you want me and one day you'll let me go. You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose." And you say, "stay."  You say i only hear what i want to.         Paging, Crazy...that's Crazy to the reception desk. Thank you!
