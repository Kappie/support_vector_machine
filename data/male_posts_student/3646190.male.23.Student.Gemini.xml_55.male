It is not the laughter of cruelty or contempt, but the laughter of joy and satisfaction that came from my work. I hope that makes sense. It is comparable to when folks cry when they are so happy.  I did not mean to pick on ya either regarding the "trivial" things in life. I just have been doing a lot of day to day stuff that is trivial but just as important as political stuff. Perhaps it is coincidence that it is about the same time that your post appeared on discussing trivial stuff.  Also, it seems my own writing and emotions need a break. I have not had much to say lately because of my focus on politics and I think for now I have spilled a lot into my journal.... I dont know if I will be as consistent as I have been in the past--writing almost everyday.  I do know I want to reply to Anon 1's post on Women in Islam. It has been on my mind and I will make time for it in the following days.  take care
