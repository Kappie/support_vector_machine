I went up to her and gave her my picz and the bracelet i bought her...she was speechless...:)...yeah, then at lunch she came up to me and met me at the vball table, she said that she really like what i wrote on the picture and the bracelet and i made a good guess that she like butterfliez...hehe, and we jus got lost for wordz...hehe, i jus get speechless when i really like someone, that utter quietness, haha...well its all good. Then today we had to do the ventura road run, which was lame...like i chilled for the 1st part of the run, that after that, i kicked into my 2nd gear, and jus kicked everyonez ass except for Bz, cuz that foo is one fast mutha fucka. Then we had weight room and that was it...well hopefully i get to talk to her later on today, she basically made my whole day...:)...later dayz.
