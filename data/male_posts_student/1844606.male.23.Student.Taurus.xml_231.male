The other day I downloaded fifteen songs (mostly rare Wilco tracks from soundtracks and the like) and then tried to put them on my computer. Apparently, you have to be hooked up to the internet and/or continue to have napster's mandatory software installed on your computer.   This is why people steal music.   PS  After doing more research it looks like you have to have the most current version of Microsoft Media or whatever it's called.  My version of 7 or 8 is sooooooo outdated...Plus, if you think you're gonna get wise and just convert it to something more people friendly like, oh I don't know, iTunes, tough luck it don't work.  Copywrite protection beeeeyatch.
