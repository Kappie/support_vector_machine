Through this I found out something amazing: children are transfixed upon a television. It doesn't even have to be showing anything. A blank, blue screen will suffice; the children will love it. Today I played videos for all six of these classes. From Kindergarden through grade six, the kids just sat there quietly. It was amazing. Best classes I've ever had. I noticed that there are four levels of television understanding with kids:  Grade 5+6: Cool, it's video time. We don't have to do anything.  Grade 4+3: A movie! This is funny stuff! Grade 2+1: Wow, a dancing elephant! Kindergarden: [mouths agape. no comprehension until the songs come in]
