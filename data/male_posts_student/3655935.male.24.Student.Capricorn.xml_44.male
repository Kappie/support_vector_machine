This is because if God is timeless, then all reality is simultaneously present and real before him in his “eternal now.”  This would mean that sin is eternally present before God.  It never goes away.  It never diminishes.  In fact, Jesus’ death on the cross is forever before his eyes.  Of course, God is aware of his victory over sin and the resurrection, which are also eternally present before him.  However, these victories are forever mitigated by the evils that are eternally before God.  If God is timeless, he never has complete victory of sin.  Oddly enough, only creatures in time would have that victory because those who are redeemed will eventually live in heaven where there is no more evil, sin, and death.  So, if it is important for God to have an undivided victory over evil, then God must be in time.
