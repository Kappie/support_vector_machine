I end so many paragraphs like that, I don't know, that's the general idea most of the time.  Apparently one person tells me that it's getting tiring talking about stuff, maybe I should just cut her off.  We'll see.  Oh, and here's a quote just for that person's benefit, not actually funny but makes a point:  Me: Do you remember how to get to 2 Washington St.?  Mock Trials is there on Sunday.  My father: Oh, you mean that big fancy mansion?
