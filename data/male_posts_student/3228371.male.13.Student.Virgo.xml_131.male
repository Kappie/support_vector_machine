I need Wilfred's help though... 'cos I need to make a computer graphic-ish logo for something. So yeah... I made a little picture that says Graffiti... black and white though. Meh, whatever. I tried.  So bored. Phew... need to type up an email for band. Blah... I'll do that and then game for a while. I'm off.  Brian, we need to talk.
