Better than Jessica Li's, anyways, but I'm angry that Eleanor had to raise the bar so high.  Speaking of whom, Loren prostrated himself again in front of Jessica Li today; that is getting annoying.  I saw things passionately today.  I don't mean that I had an emotional reaction to the issues of my life or anything; more like I saw my surroundings with an emotional response, like a painting.  It was probably because after we watched "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" in myth, folk tale, and science fiction, my eyes weren't adjusted to the light.

I was the only one who showed up, and I left after fifteeen minutes.  I so want to punch that group, except for like three people.  Today I decided to go to the library a few hours after school.  A CD that I had wanted had finally come in, and I got it.  It's the source of the song that will be on my blog at the beginning of the next school year.  Very exciting.  I also saw the President on the way back.  Oh yeah, in history, Ms. Heidlage was telling us about this essay we're going to write on the final about free-market democracy, and I thought that Gabe should start his, "My fellow Americans..."  Then some stuff happened with Steph that was resolved half an hour ago.  Here are some quotations from the movie we watched in history about Israeli and Palestinian children:   It's their land, but we don't want to blow up.  It's complicated. --- An Israeli parent   from  Promises    Don't speak Israeli [Hebrew] in the camp because the Arabs don't like anything. --- A Palestinian child   from  Promises
