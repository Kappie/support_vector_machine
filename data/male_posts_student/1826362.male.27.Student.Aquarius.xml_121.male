Very few Presidents have won the Electoral College with victories in a minority of the states.  George W. Bush pieced together his victory by winning 31 states (over 60%).  Had Gore won, it would have been with the lowest percentage of states in history.  (In comparison, Kennedy had 46% of the states in 1960 and Carter had 47% in 1976.)   It is worth noting that around 1/3 of Al Gore's popular vote margin over George W. Bush came from Washington, D.C alone where Gore got 86% of the popular vote." the system keeps politicians from ignoring the needs of less populous states.
