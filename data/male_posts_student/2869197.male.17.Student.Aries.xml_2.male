The other two varsity debaters will not be returning, leaving me as the last of the varsity debaters! Cam steped down due to verbal abuse and underappreciation from all the Debate team. I felt terrible. As I explained in my Debate portfolio, I admit I've made fun of Cam on several occasions, but realize that they were foolishness. It really made me think about the things I say in fun which can be taken incorrectly. Cam is an awesome guy and a legendary debater, and I truly hope he reconsiders.   I went to Hage's and bought a Bible cover for the Bible I received at Christmas. It was a thoughtful journey. Going to Hage's reminds me of the commercialization Christianity has gone through. Christian message cards, necklaces, pens, markers, and books upon books line the store walls. I think of the original days of Christianity where your only form of Christian merchandise was a quickly scribbled ichthus symbol on the ground. Perhaps it would be better to return to those days and perhaps not. If you find enlightenment from Christians book, then read them. If you hear God in Christian music, then listen indeed. If not, then don't.  Tonight's First Priority leader's meeting ended late and for good reason. We got sucked into a wonderful discussion of denominational doctrine, sacraments, and the walls between denomanations. It was a fulfilling experience. I personally believe that while denominational preference is fine and dandy, it should be set aside when we come together as the Body. What are these petty fights compared to the great truth we all know and love?
