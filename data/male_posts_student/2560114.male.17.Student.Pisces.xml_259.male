We kept on making some key mistakes, aswell as some stupid onez...but yeah, i didnt play particullarly well, probly cuz im tired and exhausted. My killz were alright, only a few were down ballz wit power, my passing was ok...some games im off and some games im on...w/e, if dan getz pissed at me for bein inconsistant...so be it, i cant b perfect and play really well all the damn time. Especially when im exhausted all the time, and i jus dont feel like practicing or even playin vball in that matter. Vball is jus not my favorite thing to do right now...im jus lookin forward to my summer and lookin forward to spending more time wit stephanie...thats how i feel right now...great! but burnt out aswell...later
