"Oh, come on now," said the friend, "Surely you have met at least on girl that you wanted to marry."  "Yes, there was one girl .. once. I guess she was the one perfect girl .. the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right everything .. I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me."  "Well, why didn't you marry her," asked the friend.  "She was looking for the perfect man," he said.  --I know I put this in my blog before, but I like it a lot, so I'm putting it in again.   I was talking with someone I am acquainted with, but am not quite friends with yet, and she says I am too shy. I am sort of shy, but usually when I meet new people I usually end up listening to others converse with them about things that happened at an event I was not present at, or something that I have no knowledge of. Thus, it is hard to establish common bonds with the people that I meet because others are always busy expressing their common bonds with them and I don't get much of a chance, partly because I am shy. Make any sense at all?  Well then: First order of business (I wish I could put sounds on this blog, I want like the judges hammer from law and order on here when i say that): What is going on this weekend, what are the plans, and who are the planners?  Second order: Hmm.. well I will think of a second order and put it on here right away, dammit.  Third order of business: Math final tomorrow--oh shit.. im outta here  This is the story of a girl/Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!/And while she looked so sad in photographs  I absolutely love her/when she smiles
