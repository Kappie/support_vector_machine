I am rather lonely at this moment, for I am currently in Florida and utterly isolated from everyone save my family, which might as well imply that I am isolated from everyone period. Ani is here with me though. Despite the minor drawback that she is on a CD. But she is somewhat here and she is preserving what traces of sanity I have left.  Alanna and Brock, I very much appreciate the Ani concert CD. (Actually, I love you for it. Recollect how I began wheezing at school when I unwrapped it.) Morgan, thank you so much for just getting the haircut. It is immensely happy. In addition to all that fun stuff, I now own 2 more Ani CD's, a le Tigre CD, a formal suit-like assembly, a pi tie pin (and matching shirt - 3.1415926535...),  Ghost Soldiers ,  A FRANCISCA LIA BLOCK BOOK THAT NOW OWNS MY EXISTENCE , formal silver pins, and a car CD player (yo). Power.  I necessitate updates on Cindy and the Battle of the Prince Charmings. Gracias.  Happy New Year. Cheers, mortals.
