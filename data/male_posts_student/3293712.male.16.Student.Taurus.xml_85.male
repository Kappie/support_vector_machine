I stand on the side of truth and justice, and unfortunately neither of the candidates stand on this side. It is really a choice between a corporate Democrat and a corporate Republican. But Bush is one of the worst Presidents in the history of America, and even if Kerry is only  slightly  better, it is a step in the right direction. After Kerry is elected, our focus will shift to keep progressing towards a better America, and repairing the damage Bush made in our civil liberties and relationships with the global community. I hate to be pessimistic about politics, but how much farther will we go? I will keep fighting for change, but unless the majority of the American public wakes up far-sweeping change will be hard to put in place.  Because I haven't in a couple months, I read Dan Holbrook's blog today. He said something along the lines of "treat the people that I liked like I liked them." An obvious concept, but one that struck me as one of my major problems. I don't know if I appear naturally indifferent, or what, but people seem to get the impression that I hate them. I don't.   Me and John had to work today, and it was a long 7 hours. Nothing much happened, and after work sucked. I did absolutely nothing except read the paper. To worsen my mood, it started raining. Kali called me and asked if I wanted to come hang out with her and Hannah, and I thought about it but decided that I wasn't really in a mood to do anything, I just was looking for something to complain about. So I respectfully declined and instead went over to my mom's house in search or pie and Pokemon. I couldn't find either, so I went to Best Buy to look for Pokemon. It was closed right when I got there, and again I felt let down.  Here is a convoluted story for you: Today I saw Bryce, his girlfriend, and his sister at the bookstore.  But that isn't the right place to start the story. Hold on. Terry told Chris that he 'has a chip on his shoulder from hanging around with that Bryce kid,' because he thinks Bryce is poor. Being the good conservative soldier he is, he thinks poor people, women, minorities, and non-Christians are inferior to him. Oh, and he hates homosexuals, I bet. So anyway Chris freaks out and calls PD a bigot, a racist, and some other words I won't mention. Chris gets grounded for it. The stupid thing is that Bryce is like the most laid back person in history and I have never seen him pick a fight with anyone. I told Bryce about it, and he just took it in stride. PD also distrusts us- he always thinks we are doing drugs or drinking or smoking. Although we have told him over and over we don't believe in that shit, he still is waaay too suspicious.   Parents, the reason that your kids are never home is because they don't like sitting at home. Simple as that. They aren't coke fiends, aren't out driving drunk, aren't out picking fights. The kids are alright, and the reason kids get mad at parents is their lack of trust. Just keep 'innocent until proven guilty' in mind, OK?  I like books I don't get. Have you ever read a book like that? I was just reading one. It was called  Survivor , by Chuck Palahuik. Other goodies are  Catch-22  and  American Gods . Ok, I understood  Gods , but it was weird.  I had this idea today that I could document everything I did in one day for the blog. I could take notes and the minutes and whatnot. Actually, I think that is a good idea and I am going to do it on Friday.   Joey is dead (cancer), Dee Dee is dead (drug overdose), and now Johnny is on his way (cancer).  When the Ramones are gone, who will be left from the first wave of punk? Joe is gone, Sid is gone, Johnny Rotten sucks, and now 3/4 of the Ramones are dead or dying.  What I bought today: 10.00 Gas Punk-O-Rama 9 (with free DVD!) Alternative Press magazine  I don't like AP because it represents everything I hate about corporate rock taking over punk. It always has a shitty band on the cover, and the AP top ten is half emo/half pop-punk. Once in a while, it covers the bands I like, so I buy it. But I still hate myself every time I buy it.   What if we burned a blog mix? Wouldn't that be cool? Split 20 songs 6 ways? It would reflect our diverse tastes. Yeah, that'd be cool.   I like Atom and his Package, and I'll throw a brick at anyone who calls Atom emo.   I reference emo way too much here.  Hey, Creed broke up.   All this bubbling outrage and sarcasm has built up inside me, and I can't even remember what caused it. It was really funny too, because I remember I kept laughing when I was driving around today.  Jeff made a comment on Derby's blog today insinuating that he needs to "get out more." Now I'm don't exactly stalk Jeff, but I'm pretty sure he has two modes: work and home.    Anyone know any other good blogs? I like reading them.  I now feel like today was a success. It seems now that every day is a success to me. You see, a loosely connected group of people, agencies, and governments I call "The Man" is always trying to keep me down. Every day I still exist I spit in The Man's face. I enjoy the thought that I really  am  a revolutionary, that every day I am alive there is still hope for freedom, democracy, and fashion.   Speaking of fashion, it seems that the revolution is finally starting to catch on. Today Bryce's girlfriend told me that she liked my shoes. Everyone says that. But hey, I  was  looking hot today. I was rapidly approaching teen-heartthrob status, and I had to contain that inside my house lest Hannah or Kali start in on their "Josh Mattson" talk.   Well, I didn't go anywhere tonight. There is always tomorrow.   Don't let The Man get you down.
