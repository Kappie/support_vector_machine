Anyway I'm just debating weather to have the dates in greek or english, it doesn't really matter I guess, just makes the archive dates say Ιούλιος instead of July, and πμ instead of am, and so fourth... ah I'm so indecisive. However I really wish I knew/remembered a bit more HTML so I could really modify the why this page looks, mostly I just want to change the space these main posts are put in to a bit bigger, there is so much more room on the page that they could use! oh well ill figure it out, or ask my sister to help me (ok I admit it! she knows more HTML than I do!   but I know more about computers overall... eyah...  ).  I'm really not excited about work this week, my schedule is kinda messed up, usually I go into work about 5, or 6, but tomorrow I go in at 10:30 in the morning, what is that? Like a normal time, cheah... μακάρι (better, or I wish) it could be today, then perhaps I could go catch part of institute... Also on friday I go in at 4, seriously who orders pizza @ 4 pm? k so I would but fish, (I use the conjoining word "fish" here because I just noticed I ues "yeah" way too much) not every day. I shouldt complain, and I'm not really, I just think its odd, and I'm confused, cause I've never gone in at 10:30 before, I guess cause I'm leaving they are giving me whatever slot is left to put me in. But only 8 more days of that fun so yes.  I like fanta orange.  I wonder if they ever tried to, or dose it exist, a dark chocolate icecream, or would that just be nasty. Dunno. Perhaps in mainland europe somewhere, they like a lot of coco in there chocolate there. In fact they tried to tell the english company Cadberries that they couldn't call there chocolate chocolate anymore because it didn't have enough coco... of course they told them to stick it in there ear, england "discovered" (or ripped off the idea from the indans, but made it what it is today) chocolate, and this is how they have always done it.  Well, I should e-mail some people now, but, really I cant be bothered. The sad thing is when its day I'm all like hey, ill e-mail tonight, and when it night I'm all like hey, ill e-mail tomorrow during the day, but neither ever gets done. ah well. ya'll be good now.
