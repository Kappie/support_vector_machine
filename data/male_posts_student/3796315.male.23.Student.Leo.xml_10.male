The chicken didn't turn out that good,because I left it for too long;.. the drumsticks are too huge! Well, but it's still edible ya, haha. COmmited the same mistake by cooking it too long. Beef stew still ok. Michelle is cooking  Mee Sua  with red egg for birthday boy which is me, haha. It's a long time since I had that,traditional birthday. WX came home early from his lecture to help out. He asked: " Where is lead actress of the night ". Haha, no   lead actress  tonight ya.   Tasted the 9-layer cake that Michelle made. It exceeded my expectation, tasted like the real Mccoy though the layers weren't very nicely done. Anyway, waiting for Dominic (our neighbour) to come home from school (QUT-the real University) before we start the dinner. Also hope that Serene will be in time for dinner too ya.   Ok, have to go and help out in the kitchen.  Ciaoz.. The Birthday BoY
