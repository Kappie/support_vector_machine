A lot of people are watching there, number of fans of Harry Potter is still increasing.. The graphics are better than the first movie but darn! I missed the second one.. maybe I should get the DVD and watch it someday.. Harry's wizardry had improved a lot, i can say. Daniel Radcliffe and gang are much older now, can see that they are much more matured.. So what can i say? Must watch!!!
