Ok, for those of you who don’t know eddie (you are so lucky) he is a guy in my grade. how shall i go about explaining eddie. well, first, he has 3 lips. which is overwhelmingly hot. no, no joke. 3 lips; because he constantly lips above his upper lip, so he has developed this irritation above his top lip, that looks like a 3rd lip. eww. next, eddie is really into dungeons and dragons. which is weird.   but, i mean that’s no reason not to like the poor chap. I don’t like him because he’s mean and annoying. i wanted to pelt him with baseballs. so, when eddie is talk, like, for example in a debate, he can’t talk in a fluid sentence. it sounds like this: “and *moan* that’s why i think *moan* that drug *moan* testing in businesses *moan* should be *moan* *moan* legal.” it’s so gross. and during PE, omg this is the worst; ok, during PE he always tries to encourage the kids on the other team. and be all just when there’s a hard call to make in baseball. and it’s not like he know anything about it, he is the most un-athletic person in the world.  the best was when we started our baseball unit in PE, so we all got in groups and did slow pitch and hit sorta thing. so, i was pitching. and every time i pitched something non-perfect he go “nice pitch LUCY”. and so finally i was just like “NICE FACE EDDIE!!!!!” and he shut up. twas awesome. so yea. i hate him. i want to shove his head up his ass. oh, mad do i wanna do that, g2g"   This is what I think of Eddie: Annoying  I don't "hate" him, per se... I just find him incredibley, amazingly, overly annoying... But I feel bad for him...  Anyway... Everytime any teacher asks a question, he is the first one to raise his hand, and then either one of the following three things happen:  A) He will raise his hand, and if the teacher does not call him within five seconds of his hand being in the air, he will go: "Ummm..." every ten seconds until the teacher will notice him.  B) He will raise his hand, and so will someone else, and the teacher will call on the other person and Eddie would groan in frustration VERY loudly.  C) If he does finally get called on, he will pause for a few seconds, then he will say: "*Laughs obnoxiously* I forgot... Come back to me" or "Dangit!! I forgot! *laughs obnoxiously*  That's Eddie for you.  Oh, and always before J.S. Eddie will read a book. And as soon as Tsipi, the teacher, comes he will continue reading until he is told not to. One time, she told him not to read, and he said: "I'm not reading!!" in his high-pitched voice although his gigantic eyeballs were staring right into his tome. And she said: "Eddie! Put the book away or I am confiscating it!" and he said: "What?!? But I wasn't reading!" and she said: "Don't say 'what?' to me!!" and then Eddie said... "I  will  say 'what?' all I want because this isn't fair."  Eddie spent the rest of the class in the office.  This is a picture of Eddie, courtesy of Lucy:     Yes, Ladies and Gentleman, observe the perfect circle that is... Eddie!
