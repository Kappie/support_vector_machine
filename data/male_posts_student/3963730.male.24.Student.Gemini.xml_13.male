I am really pleased,I love them. They are " the mysterious cities of gold ", and " once upon a time.. the life ".        Bothwere on TV in england when I was a child, some time around 1990.     ("cities of gold" played twice on BBC, and "once upon a time.. the life", played only once that I saw, on channel 4) .  I had been waiting ever since, for cities of gold to be played on TV again but it never was, but since 2001 these dvds have been released (only in France) .        I don't remember the ending that these dvds have for cities of gold, so I am not sure that they played all the episodes on TV over here.       I admit I was slow tochange fromvhs todvds,theseare the first ones I have bought and I amproud of them (did you already guess?)  those memories mean a lot to me .   My mum thinks I am becoming a kid again! I agree and I don't see anything wrong with it. I loved them as a kid, and I am so pleased to feel that again. I thought this could be a good moment to mention to her that I saw dvds of two other series of my childhood: the old 80s series' of Dungeons and dragons, and He-man: masters of the universe. So look out for a writeup on them when I get them next time!     Lets make  atoast to being a kid again!  Cheers.     dave      P.S. the one series Imost want to find next is  Ulysses , (set in space) remember that!Who loves it?
