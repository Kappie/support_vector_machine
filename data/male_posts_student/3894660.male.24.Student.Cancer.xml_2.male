Went to temple and got a lot boding good stuff........well at least feels better rite? Bought a nice looking crystal for my darling too......hope her nightmares would be less frequent and she can sleep better.  Woke up the morning yest again angry......y does my dear have to question me like a crinimal early in the morning? The feelign realli sux to wake up to such things......Oh here I am typing den my little doggy "Bobbie" walks in.......He ar....realli KAPOH(curious)..........he is now strolling around the house looking for stuff to nibble at i guess, new stuff. He is a glutton like his mummy!!!  Yest Bobbie managed to conquer his fear of heights.....my dad says i need to conquer my own mental block of computing subject too.......sighz...i simply have no motivation to do it......would I managed to find some motivation to study hard?  TOday going shopping with my dear, den my dear going to cut her hair......wonder how it would turn out. :)       Quote of the day: "Does one love what he sees in a person or what exist in a person?"
