I even chuckled a little bit thinking about how narrow minded it was. I could really care less about it, just kind of interesting.   I guess I have nothing to complain about.. I lost my two best friends.. but after losing them, I realized how constricting they were towards my lifestyle. I'm starting to think I might be better off without them. Hey, if they have better things to do than to pick up the phone and invite me to parties, that's fine with me, I can have my own party.. I'll invite all of you!  Anyways, I'm going to Augsburg on Thursday to check out the campus. Sounds like it should be fun. Aced the math test today. Juries in band are next week, and I should probably practice.   Nah.
