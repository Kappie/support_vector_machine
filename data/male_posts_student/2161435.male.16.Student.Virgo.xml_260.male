In fact, the whole ting was good. Yay! Especially Puss in Boots.  In other news: I am bored now. I have Ju jutsu tonight. I bought a drink from the Co-op in the barbican, and they were on BOGOF, so I got an extra one too. I also ahd fish and chips for lunch, but they lacked something in the salt and vinegar department. Now, I think the last 4 posts on heere are from me, so will someone else   please  write somehing?
