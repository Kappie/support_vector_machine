I have decided that instead of getting a new one in maybe a year or two, i would upgrade this one to my liking.    Well, a couple of months ago, i started upgrading by putting a new 512 MB RAM chip into it.  Improved performance to my liking, and now i can play all the stuff that couldn't before.  At the same time i was thinking of getting a new video card, a  urlLink Radeon 9800  *shivers at the thought*, beautiful card!  I decided against it, because i don't game much on my PC, and when i do game, my  urlLink nVidia  Geforce can play it.    Well, i wanted a linux box for some time now, and after months and months of waiting, i finally have my chance.  I didn't want to format either of my machines, because that would mean losing any data i was to lazy to back up.  And since i ahve so much stuff, it would take days to burn all of it.  So, today i got a new HD.  Its a beautiful peice of machinery too.  160 Gb, 7200 RPMs, all that i would need for a linux box and more.  Its twice as big as my old HD (80 x 2= 160).  I'm going to put some files that i dont' need on my windows drive onto the linux drive, to even up the load as well.  I'm so happy!   Also, i noticed that my DSL modem was getting quite hot sitting under my desk on top of my subwoofer.  I decided yesterday that i wanted to mount it on one of the 'walls' under my desk.  So, thats what my dad and i did today.  It is now safely blinking it's green lights as i download a Gentoo Linux ISO.  Ahhh, the pure bliss!  Oh how i love Technology!    Lates
