What He is releasing is not something that this nation has not really seen before, this is not a unity that can be broken as long as we all walk in humility.  here humility is key!  one thing that the Lord is bringing out of His children is a true serving quality. i feel like He is saying, "just as I came to the earth as a servant, so should all my children opperate in the same humility.  Becuase when I come again to the earth I will be seen as a King, a King of supreme Glory, and on that day all My children who walked the same humility in thier life, as I always have in mine, will be revealed as the kings that they are.  I am the King of kings and I am the Lord of lords, My name will be known throughout the entire universe as that once again, My name is about to be revealed in it's Glory once again to many of My people who have strayed away or stumbled on the path.  amen once again."      I feel like this is really something we as the church of america should approach with all the praises of our hearts.  He is releasing a movement through the Holy Spirit like we have never seen before, AMEN!!!!!!  Pray and intercede over this prophecy so it may come to pass onehundred fold as we expect.    PRAISE THE LORD!!!!
