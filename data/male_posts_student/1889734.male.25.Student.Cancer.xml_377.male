First, I'm amazed by the hack job he is doing on his former boss.  It is rather unseemly for anyone in a cabinet level post to do this kind of thing.  The Executive Branch isn't like a job you and I would have, where we might vent our spleen over a boss that rubbed us the wrong way.  At this level, loyalty and discretion is expected, even if you have princicpled disagreements with your boss.  I'm sure Colin Powell has enough material to fill several books, but I expect he will be classy enough to take his disagreements home with him and lock them away, where they may surface a decade or so down the road, when it is more acceptable to mark out your position for historical record - not to score points against your boss.  O'Neill has broken many unwritten rules here, but beyond that, many of his claims are sounding laughable.  He blows the whistle on Bush's plan to invade Iraq, hatched well before 9/11.  Hey Paul, you ever think that it is PRUDENT to have such plans laying around, long before a need arises?  Would he be surprised to learn that we have plans sitting in the Pentagon to invade Canada?  England?  Mexico?  This is why we have a military, and part of their job is to plan for ALL things before we even consider them possible.  But even beyond common sense planning, regime change has been the stated policy of this nation since the first Bush, and even Clinton had plans laying around.  O'Neill has a decided opinion on the utility of tax cuts, which is fine.  He is entitled to his position.  However, the proper thing to do in such a situation is resign quietly and go home if you are that principled over the situation.  O'Neill hung around and focused his attention on non-Treasury issues, such as the environment and AIDS.    O'Neill's charges really don't require an in-depth defense.  I don't believe they will cause any harm, since most of the claims are easily demonstrated as nothing more than sour grapes over his firing.  Plus, he has a book to hawk, so the more damaging the claims, the more money he will make.    It is simply amazing to witness a complete attack on a sitting president by a former employer.  It is simply ungentlemenly.
