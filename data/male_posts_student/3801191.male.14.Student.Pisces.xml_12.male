Lets see, for starters, this saturday is gonna b the start of the POP sessions...and yes, im gonna have to see Ng Lye Kuang's freaky face again...yep, peeps, if im in IMH on sunday undergoin therapy for severe mental shock, you know wat happened...lets see...lemme explain this in an equation...  POP Sessions + Me = Ng Lye Kuang + Hot Sun + Standing still for 8-plus hours = ME goin MADDD...  Get the picture? Nvm...  On top of that, i got dumped on by almost every teacher...a.k.a. Ive now got a 30cm pile of assignments on my table to complete...lets see...math...history...science...chinese...oh yes, did i mention that ive gota finish the damned poster for IVP? *sigh*  On a brighter note... we had the re-test for the NCO theory test today. Apparently, every single one of us failed the first time round...   Cold sweat pouring down Drenching me into the ground The clock ebbs The slides change The papers crinkle  The soft scribbling of pens Resonates around the room of terrors Bounces off the walls Like a ghostly echo  The time ticks away Ten seconds left   The atmosphere of the room...was just...just...y'know  Well yea...Kejia bombed on that one...and to save herself from the rath of the commissioner, she had to give us a retest...even though she originally claimed that "a re-test is impossible".  So yep, nothing much else today...
