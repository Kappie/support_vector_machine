They are hilarious and put on a great show, though the amount of old gay men was sort of frightening, never thought to see so many queers at first ave, especially middle aged one. It was rather funny though, i went to this band that sings about dick with four lesbians, kinda the story of my life though, can't escape the lesbians. Did not go to the going away party, chickened out. I want school to start. I am sick of sitting around with nothing to do. I hate empty time.  I did not bring home an achingly beautifull punk rocker, or indeed, any punk rocker, but i had a great time with jim beam and Mr. Newcastle and was not dissapointed.
