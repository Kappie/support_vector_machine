Probably one of my favorite movies.  At the theatre, they showed a preview for Blade Trinity! It looks awsome! I won't to see it real bad now. check out the site...but, I warn you, its about vampires and stuff...so enter at your own risk... http://www.bladetrinity.com yeah, it looks pretty sweet!   Anyway, enough gory love movies...I keep forgetting to post something thats really important to me...very close to my heart...EXTREMELY close to my heart...yes...I did get a haircut. haha. jk. I mean, yeah, I did. I'm still getting used to it. Its like shorter than my friend austin's hair...  Still working on my novel, and I got some real sweet ideas. The main character's partner is going to be a vampire. Its going to be so fun.   I'm going to publish this post before it gets to long...
