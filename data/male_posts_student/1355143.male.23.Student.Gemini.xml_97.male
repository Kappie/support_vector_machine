Once again my subject matter is football related but as I sit here in the newly opened Locutorio on Borrell in my England shirt the sense of anticipation continues to build.  England vs. France my friends will kick off very very soon and as soon as my time runs out on this machine I will most probably start on the pre-drinking, on my own if I have to!  Of course, I may well wake up hungover and devastated come tomorrow morning but whilst my optimism still exists I find it worthy of celebrating!  Three of my friends from back home have just left me following on the heels of Steffen and Vali, which capped off 8 days of hectic living in my apartment!  My body was racked for days with various ailments and I have only just started to shit solidly for the first time in a week (sorry, very crude I know!).  The flat is back ship shape and I started to pack up some of the crap that I have managed to accumulate over the last ten months, you would all be surprised by how much stuff is in my room and I may well be surprised by how much I might have to leave behind!  It is strange to think that my time here is coming to an end, it is strange even to think that I am still here considering that most of everyone else left over 6 months ago and I have said hello and goodbye to more faces than I can remember.  I am really looking forward to going home though, my time has come and I am really glad that I will be leaving on a high....  So off to the football I go, wish me luck won't you, we wouldnt want those frog bastards to win now would we ;op  Be good boys and girls,  A
