I was talking with Tony (the resident Tesco security guard) about my swelling balloon tummy, and I have to lose this waist-line and appetite and overall consumption - it's not fair on me, Mother and Father, or my bank balance for that matter.  So, this will be my devilish concoct, well in a draft stage at least, commencing as of 7pm yesterday evening once wise old Tony gave me his personalised diet  plan pack , amidst some personal input I must admit:  - Nothing fizzy (Tony) - Nothing fatty at tesco breaks (Me) - Cycle to work this summer (Tony) - No sugary/salty food (Tony) - More worthwhile occupying activities i.e drugs (E's especially) and work (Me obviously) - Attempt to use household workout gear like the rowing machine (Me) - 3 meals a day (Tony and Me).  So there done, this blog will end if I fail it . . .  A punishment of the highest order.  On another topic, I'm ready for a holiday - the easy part there - saying it. Now going on it will be a completely separate issue. I want somewhere sunny to get a tan and alike, a weekend or a few days in Europe is something I've done and done again and again with Mother and Father, so Ian's timeshare could come in handy. Although I feel as though there isn't nearly enough time to get a proper holiday organised, so I will have to make do with Reading again as my solitary vacation. Alas, despite 3 years since my last holiday, something will work itself out nearer Christmas time. I mean I have plenty on my plate here to keep me occupied and busy until the time where I'm in absolute desperation for a plane trip.  Work was OKish tonight I guess, although Becky's claws still hadn't smoothed of completely, I still loved mentally kicking her ass in my mind, when the customers passing through. You really should see the world I delve of into when I'm there. Makes Heaven look like a shrinking violet. xBuBzx
