Serve week is finally over, no more cleaning up garbage for this year!  It was especially bad today, considering that it was raining hard, and my whole group got soaked.    What am i going to do this summer?  I have a few plans, but i don't know how this is going to turn out.  I want to install some distro of  urlLink linux  on my laptop.  That is basicly my first priority.  Researching what distro is the hard part.    I sort of wanted to work as well, but it seems like i can't find a job. I applied for one a while ago, but i haven't got a call from them yet, so it looks like i'm out of luck for this summer.    My parents won't like the idea of me sitting in front of my computer screen for the whole summer, but that seems like what i'm going to be doing.  Just watching anime, working on my linux plans, and maybe a little  urlLink DoD .  On the subject of DoD, i must say that that game is really amazing.  How one game can keep my mind occupied for over 2 hours is incredible.  I actually found some servers that i really like today, good map rotation!  The thing about that game is that it tries to be realisitic with the weapons.  It makes it all the better when you actually kill someone.  ^_^  Ever want all your music at your finger tips?  No, this is not another advertisement for the illusive  urlLink iPod .  I was referring to the fact that i ripped all the music i had on cd to my hard drive.  Now, i have what i call my 'Ultimate Playlist', full with 223 tracks.  Wow, thats a lot... for me atleast. Think of it, my entire music collection... only 223 tracks. I'm not into music much, i guess. 'Rots your brain' as the old people say.    Lates
