He met up with Dotti and they went into Sanders to watch Dave for extra credit.  Good movie but still too early for it.  In Senyohl today, Tyke found out that he is going on the Ashland trip so that is awesome.  He is definitely starting to look forward to that.  Although the rooming thing is still not worked out.  Lunch was, wet.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, Amed, Purdy, and Dotti all went to JIB together and as Tyke was just sitting at his place Purdy accidentally knocked over her water cup and splashed some ice cold water onto Tyke's lap.  It was a nice mini-rush for Tyke's groin area.  It dried out amazingly quickly for how much water actually was on Tyke.  It was a fun little experience though and it makes Tyke smile.  But for some reason basically from the end of 4th period on Tyke was in a bad mood.  What caused it he isn't exactly sure but he just didn't feel that good about anything.  After school he came home and went down to the funeral home for an open casket visitation with a bunch of his family.  If any of you have ever been to one of these you might share Tyke's feelings.  It was quite weird to see a dead body layed out in the casket for everyone to see.  The floral arrangement and everything was wonderful (a close family friend of Tyke's who does Bill Gates flowers did the whole thing) but it was still weird.  He looked lifelike, as if he could just be blinking or something, but his face was not normal.  It just didn't look right.  The idea though of a dead body being right there was still the weirdest thing.  These visitations are either really needed or not needed in Tyke's mind.  Some people just hate them but others really want that chance to say goodbye.  Afterwards Tyke's house was the house where everyone came to chat at.  There were so many people that Tyke did not know that he felt pretty out of place.  But he did feel as though he needed to be a good host so he made himself have fun by asking everyone what they needed and just waiting on them.  It was nice to hear from his parents after everyone left that some of the people had complimented him.  That is a really nice gesture and it is always heeded.  Tyke headed downstairs for some of the time and chatted with Amed about some grade things and about how Tyke apparently needs a C- in English now.  This whole letter he got is a wee bit confusing so he isn't positive what he needs to do but hopefully he can get it all taken care of.  He does, unfortunately, need to go in early tomorrow to fake take an AP test for extra credit in english.  It won't be the most pleasant thing to do but he can't miss out on points like this when his grade really depends on it.  This is gay that Tyke has to be put in the position he is in when he is an AP student that has had no problems up until this year and that is only because of Senioritis.  Oh well, Tyke will be fine.  Tomorrow will be another busy day for Tyke.  He has to get his wisdom teeth consultation to find out when he's getting them pulled.  So when he finds out he can let you know when you will get a chance to come hang out with a drugged up Tyke.  At least one person said she would.  *siiiiigh.  Tyke is extremely tired so he has started sighing.  His body for some reason just collapsed today.  His legs are dead, his mind is dead, but his biceps are flaring.  Eh, that's weird.  No more.  Sleep.
