Clay Aiken-When You Say You Love Me  I've been watchin' you from afar and the way you make your way 'round the bar You act like you're really entertained And your smile like it's your favorite game Now you're movin' closer to me And our eyes connected emotionally I'm not lookin' for a one night stand (stand) Or a place for a broken heart to mend (mend)  I know everybody here wants to hold ya I know what it's like 'cause I feel the same (same, same) When you look in my eyes There's a part of me that's still afraid  When you say you love me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time To hear you say you love me Like you mean it All I wanna do is make you mine I've been hurt way too many times  They say if you wanna make God laugh (yeah) All ya gotta do is tell him your plans I know that the time is not right (right, right) Didn't know that I would meet you tonight (night, night) Not that I don't really like the attention I feel like the only man in the room Are you really sincere? Is this just something that you do?  Now when you say you love me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time Like you mean it Baby, when you hold me Make me feel it All I wanna do is make you mine I've been hurt way too may times  Again, and again, and again I've been hurt, my friend, till the end You know I been high, I been low I got no place left to go Again, and again, and again When will this search ever end?  When you say you loe me Do you mean it? Baby, when you hold me Do you feel it? I believe the magic in your eyes I will wait until the end of time To hear you say you love me Like you mean it Baby, when you hold me Make me feel it All I wanna do is make you mine I will wait until the end of time Baby, say you love me Come on, baby, say you love me Oh Ooooo To hear you say you love me Baby, say you love me
