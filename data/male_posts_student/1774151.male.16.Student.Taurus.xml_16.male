In other news, winter formal is next week. Rock on. Hopefully i will have a better time than i did at the St. Mary's Formal. Dianna=wearing an outfit entirely out of character (poofy cinderella dress) but thats cool. I really have no idea as to what to say but i feel obligated to post something. O yea. The Hart, Mike, John, Kaj Cd will be coming out before the end of february for all you die hard fans. I forget what we decided to call it.  Hear is a sneak peek of the lyrics: "Once upon a time in the land of heist, when the deer were stoned and so were the mice, we had sex once or twice............................................................................ .... WITH A STAPLER!!!!!!!!!!" Thats all you get for now. We may be putting a song on the website but im not sure. So yeh....the cd is gonna rock cuz we are also gonna make fun of angus's shit CD while we are at it. chuch.
