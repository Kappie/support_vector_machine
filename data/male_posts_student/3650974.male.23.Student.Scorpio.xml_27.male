       
      First off, welcome back to all the kids over at Selleck. We missed you.  Just got back from Kansas City, after an unexpectedly eventful trip. As we were leaving town, Jesse decided we should take the scenic route - that is, the Kansas side instead of the Missouri side. Sounded good to me. And it  was  pretty scenic; lots of green rolling countryside. Saw Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary for the first time, a monumentally imposing structure that reminded me of nothing so much as the Smithsonian. And we made a lot of unexpected detours onto dirt roads to get past accidents or missing bridges.  Then, as we neared the Nebraska border, we noticed a nasty-looking storm looming dead ahead. Seemed like a good time to pull off, have some dinner, and wait for the storm to pass. And not a moment to soon. As we got out of the car outside a McDonalds in Hiawatha, KS, we realized that the town's tornado sirens were going off. And moments after we walked in the door, all of the power went off and stayed off. And moments after  that , lightning struck the gas price sign directly across the street. Then it started raining, horizontally, in 70+ mph winds. Turns out that a tornado was indeed passing only a few miles to the south. We only got sideswiped by the edge of it, but that was nasty enough that I don't want to think about the eye. Between the storm and the detours, by the time we got home, a normally three hour trip had taken over five hours. Now that's pretty damn scenic.  Otherwise, a pretty darn relaxing weekend. We drank a lot, slept a lot, lay around uselessly a lot. Rusty was perhaps a bit more energetic than the rest of us. Jesse and I suspect we enabled him somehow, and we're not sure how we feel about that, but all's well that ends well.  Second session starts tomorrow, which means that I'll be in Advanced Finance, 11:00 - 12:30, Monday through Friday. If your schedule is compatible with mine and you ever want to do lunch, just let me know.
