I did not do much either. Talked to some folk online, my sister kept getting me mad, my room got messy, and next thing I know I am upset.  I still feel upset, and last night I was going to do stuff to myself ( nothing good)  But Theo told me not to. So  Itold him I wouldn't. Then this morrning when I woke up Juli (my dog) scratched me. SO NOW! It looks like I did what I said I was not going to do. Also last night I had a hard time sleeping. (again) I HATE THINKING SOMETIMES! Then once I finally got to sleep I had a "sick dream" sont ask. So last night while I was thinking, I thought that maybe I do not give Rhae alot of attention. Or at least not as much as she deserves. But it is not entirely my fault. We live realitivly...far from eachother. And due to driving I can not always get to her. And that makes me upset 'cause I can not controll something. ( I am human, I have to be in controll sometimes.) And I feel she gets frustarated with me because of this...  I also thought about my own life...I really need to go see Dr. Rhoads....  Yesturday, I also watched part of The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. That was really funny. I want to be Larry the Cableguy's Best friend.  well I think that is all for now...
