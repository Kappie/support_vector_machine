I miss the insulting people to their faces only to have them laugh.  You know your good friends with people when you can tell them that they are fat, ugly, stupid, or really fat.  I suppose I could go out and see my friends.  Hahaha.  I judge people.  It is one of my weaknesses, one of my flaws.  Contrary to popular belief I am neither perfect nor God.  Anyway, not only do I judge people I try to compare them to people of a specific group, my peers.  When I meet people I ask myself, "If they were my age, who in my class would they be?"  I believe that some, not everyone, has a "clone" in every generation.  By clone I mean people who act, think, and treat others the same.  I look at my parents and from the stories I have heard about them I create the person they would be, or the person that they were.  I ask myself if I would be friends with them.  My mom was a hard-working overachiever.  I think I would be friends with my mother.  On the other hand, my dad was a popular jock, not to mention an asshole. I don't think I would be friends with him.  My sister is a pretentious ditz.  I know how she is and who her friends are.  I can say without a doubt that if she were two years older we still would not be friends.  It is just something to think about in your spare time.  A word of advice:  If you are thinking about people much older than you, don't think about if you would be friends with them the way they are now.  Think about if you would be friends with them when they were your age.
