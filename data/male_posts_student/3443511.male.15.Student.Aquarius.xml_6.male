It was those days were everything you did, right or wrong, would get you in trouble.  Well, i got in trouble today.  They had found out i was on the computer...  I thought that i deleted my trace, but when my mom told me that i had been on, i was like...shit..  I didn't get in much trouble, she said next time i was caught, i wouldn't be able to go on ever.  So, i found out how she probably knew i was on....stupid administraters....i used my nifty skills, and put it on anonymous...so no one knows when i log onto the internet...L0L..  Anyways, someone i knew *cough*stalker post*cough* had found this blog.... and now i have to watch out what i write...L0L...Just kidding...  >.> well, i don't know what else to write, it's just a boring summer.....as usual...i have to get new crappy clothes...yep, i'm done here.....so....l8rs  "I have walked the path for so long that i cannot be helped, but help those who are starting the life i live."  (----That's my quote, take it and you die!!!
