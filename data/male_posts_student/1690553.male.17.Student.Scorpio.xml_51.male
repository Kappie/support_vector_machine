I'm suprised that his English is quite good too. But then he followed my layout too much, and have the same disclaimer too!  urlLink Shahril , please change that!  By the way, both of them put a link to my blog at my site so I'm obliged to do the same. Happy Blogging!  :-)  Don't forget Happy Deepavali, and Happy Birthday to the Sultan of Pahang and welcome the month of Ramadhan!  - Sound of  Harapan Ramadhan  by  Raihan  Man Bai  -
