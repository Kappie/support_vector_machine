They let you know that they have eyes and that they can see you and it's about time you sat your myopic ass down.  You do so. A girl walks in, looks about 19 with what chould be her... brother? Father? She looks nervous. An old lady comes out of the clinic - it appears she's been treated already and so she sits down, waiting for a ride. A third couple walks in looking rather tired. They sit down. I'm called in to do the most important part of the procedure - paying for it. My dad comes with me.  He hands over the Amex - the amount of points derived simply from this sale are phenomenal - Amex has a "Spend $3000 and double your points for May" thing on. Just so happens my surgery is $3000. Dad needs to get back to work, and though he wants to stay I tell him to bugger off and go make smoe money. The next time I'm called in, a they dialating drops go in. After being noted regarding my condition from Dr. Alfano, they know to use special drops so I'm not blind as a bat for the next few days. They still sting like mothers though. I go back to the waiting room. Everyone is sitting there in booties and some have already donned their caps. They all look morose. I start to crack a few jokes. With in a few minutes we discover that Brandy is actually married to her rather old looking compatriot. Also, she's a op. Later I learn that she's got a very small tolerance for pain. Odd for a cop. Also there is Michelle, having travelled from Vancouver because her boyfriends' mom works there. Seems like everyone getting a discoutn except me.  Finally I get taken into the thrid room. About an hour and ahalf has passed at this point. A very nice lady whose name I didnot catch began to tryat my eyes with drops - an antiinflamatory, and an antibiotic. They both sticg. We discuss te general idea of what's going to go on, then she gets into specific.s I've been through it a few times, but I suppose they don't want any sort of mix up going on.  Finally I am sent to see Dr. Jelllie. He's very much like his name would imply. Kinda wobbly both phycially and in tone. Seems lieka  nice man, though. He beings to detail the exact process and complications therein presented bymy procedure. I begin to think "oh, shit. here we go" He starts telling me about PRK - which I've researched. Essentially  PRK laser the eye directly. seven days of near blindness and three months of roids and drops. No thank you. Lasik - Laser in situ Keratome ( I think, off the top of my head) involves uction being placed on the yee - a microkeratome (think mini guillotine or cigar cutter) is lowever on tothe eye and slices the top off, swish swish, leaving a little hinge (think nearly headless nick) by which to flip said flap open.  The idea is this. I', a boderline case (aren't I always?_ in that I could be a candidate for either. He asks me flat outright. I state that I would like LASIK. He smiles as if I've hit on the right answer. I go back to the dark room with the three green lazyboy chairs and the nice lasy. She goes through the final series of eye drops and then casuall uses a swab to anesthtize the under side of my eyelids.  Needless to say, my eyes are not th emost cooperative, but I did my best not to fight her. THe bruises should heal in a few weeks anyway. Finally she hands me what must be the smallest god damn tablet on the planet. It's Atavan. An anti anxiety drug. She says "You seem to be the calmest person we've had in while, but this'll help you sleep when you're done." I pop it.  Dr. Jellie is ready for me. Brandy is still freaking out, I give her a quick thumbs up and move on. As I pass the next room I'm informed that a patient who's had the procedure done back for an enhancement and would like to watch my procedure if I would be so kind. I said certainly. I am led into the room and told to lie down on the bed. I was hoping for restriats, I get twitchy. No such thing.  I lie down and nearly bean myself on some really freaking expensive equipment. Many hands shoot forth to prevent my cranium from damaging the priceless equipment - or is it the otherway around?  It's all bright lights and burning hair from here on in kids. I'm aligned for my right eye. The left on is taped shut with surgical tape. The right eyelashes are taped, upper and lower. the Speculum (ladies, I know it's a horrible word now) is applied to my eye and cracked open. No discomfort.the microkertome is put onto my eye with the suction device. The pressure increase (no feeling of that, I can hear them) and the world goes black. Seriously, one minute you're wsitting thtere, the next minute, the lab doesn't exist anymore.I feel a vibration across my eye, bottom to top then again, top to bottom.. Pressure goes and I see a form reach down and peel a contact lens of my eye. "Perfect flap!" exclaims Dr. J. I uncross one set of fingers. Hands wrap around my head, keeping me as still as can be and after a few light blips, a bright purple light flits around mmy eye. It sound and smells exactly as I would have expected from being told so many times - like a bug zapper burning hair. It doesn't bother me at all.twenty five.... fifty,,.. seventy five... done. After a few moments the flap is reinstated and small canoe paddles are beying a pplied to my eyes in some  way either in a lilliputian effort to circumnavigate the maris oculis or in order to smooth this chunk of eye back down so I can open and close my eyes normally. The tape is pulled and I can open and close my eyes like a champ.  The right eye is then taped shut and the procedure is repeated on the left eye. Not as smooth - I can feel the speculum and the microkeratome. I jump whne my eye gets slices. However, perfect cut again.  I'm helped from the OR and into the holding room again. The nice ldy gives me a few more drops and my kit of stuff - bion tears and my night lenses. She also gives me the oolest pair of sunglasses I'll never buy. I wear them immediately. I get my eyes checked just briefly and all appears to be well.   So there you have it. I wrote in an earlier blog wondering if I wasdefectove in the inventory control sytem of God. It appears now that I can be resold OB, refurbish. Huzzah.  I apologize for any spelling mistakes in this entry - it's purely touch type without the benefit of proofreading as I'm not supposed to stare at a screen. I'll fix em later. Maybe.
