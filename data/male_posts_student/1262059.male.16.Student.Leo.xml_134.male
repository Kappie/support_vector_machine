Dunno what the tech students needed to do, but us Focus people had to test out the accelerometers we've built. I never been to Wonderland, nor have I been on a roller-coaster.. so yah, it was pretty good experience ^^;;   We went on  the Fly  to test out our accelerometers.. it was slow enough, so it was pretty easy to test out everything. I was with my Focus group for that amount of time. After we went on that ride for like 6 times, and got all the data we needed, we split up. I went with Philip for awhile, then went wandering off. Eventually, I found Joe and other people, and I stuck with that group for the rest of the day.    We went on some rides (even like 1 or 2 kiddy ones @-@), we ate lunch (joe bought me a slice of pizza, thx joe!), and went to the arcade. I didn't bring any money, but it was pretty fun watching people play DDR. Joe beat some stranger, but then Carson beat him afterwards ^^;; I played DDR once and i can easily get owned at that game XP   The bus ride was kinda uneventful... nearly fell asleep going there, and played some Big 2 coming back.    When we got home, it was around 5pm. Then we dispersed. Our family (and my sister's bf) ate dinner with justin's family (plus their aunt). So it was like 10 people. Played a bit of DM (actually come to think of it.. that's like all we did XP) and then went home.   Tomorrow... i really need to work on my History essay.. i think it was due this week, but not many I know of are done.. do yah, I'll try to get it done by monday.   ~Chronos
