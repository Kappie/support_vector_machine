"Sheets of empty canvas, Untouched sheets of clay Were laid, spread out before me As her...body once did All five horizons revolve around her soul As the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has...taken a turn  Ooh, and all I taught her was...everything Ooh, I know she gave me all, that she wore  And now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds All the pictures have, all been washed in black Tattooed everything  I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by, some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so...why do I seer? Ooooh, and twisted thoughts that spin 'Round my head I'm spinnin', oh, I'm spinnin' How quick the sun can...drop away  Now my bitter hands Cradle broken glass Of what was everything? Oh, the pictures have...all been washed in black Tattooed everything All the love gone bad Turn my world to black Tattooed all I see, all that I am I'll that I'll be Yeah...uh huh...  I know someday you'll have a beautiful life I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky But, why Why Why? Can't it be... Can't it be...mine Aaahhha...ah, yeah...ooooh...."   "Black"- Pearl Jam.
