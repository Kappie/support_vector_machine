I sit here in this physics class of mine thinking about whether or not it would be possible for me to discover something new within this world which is quickly becoming claustrophobic with lack of ned possibilities. It is forcing me to no longer think out of the box, but re-create how we define the box. My level of thought is, on a scale of pools, lounging in the baby pool. Artistically I think of things in ways which even i surprise myself with. I need to progress my logisitic and scientific thought to the next level. I can do most of the tasks which are typically associated with a hard science, but i cant reach that next level of astounding thought. i feel that like i can read, but  at the same time unable to write.   As I move on to the next level of academia, the question of "higher-level" thinking becomes apparent again. Will i be able to succeed in the races with all my other incredibly successful peers? or will i be smothered under their greatness? hopefully, i wil be able to develop some sort of snorkel which enables me to breathe under all those other successful people.
