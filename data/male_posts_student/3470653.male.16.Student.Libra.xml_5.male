I am going to stay with my Great Aunt and Uncle and we are going to have such a great time. I am though a little nervous about flying out on my own. Knowing me I will get lost and take a flight out to some god foresaken island where not even vegetation live. But i guess i can not really get on the wrong plane. I am going to have such a great time though. I was really and truely awsome of my aunt and uncle to pay for my flight out and   I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF WHAT IS ABOUT TO COME   Well I will keep anyone who is reading posted about my trip out there.
