(becos all the other guys are no where near getting their ps - but then again, they could learn faster than me becos im soooooooooooo SLOW !! ) lol....    and its not worth driving to uni by urself because the petrol costs too much!!! so for the next few years, i think i'll be car pooling still  =) its sooooo much more economical and time efficient when u see the sign "T3"!!!!!! whoohooooooo............ zooooooom zoooom zoooooooom ooo the other day, we were drivin in T3 lane, and then two policemen comes out from the corner. The car infront of us didn't have 3 ppl, so they got fined !! =)
