How to submit when the current life style is so enjoyable? ok even if i put pleasure aside, it seems as if my character has taken shape and refuse to change. a couple of things i try to change all seem to be impossible.   ok. i'm not undermining the power of God. of course God could change me in a instant if He wanted to. but apparently He wants me to change out of my own free will. That is the hard part. i wish He would just make me. sigh.    Dear Heavenly Father.        Thank You for Your sacrifice of love for me. Help me to love You back with all my heart. Put in me the conviction and strength to change for the glory of Your name. I place myself in Your loving hands.        In Jesus' name,    Amen
