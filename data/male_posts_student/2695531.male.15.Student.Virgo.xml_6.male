It's been 35 years since that historical moment in history that so many Americans remember so clearly. Back then it was a fascination and a dream come true. Today, it is seen as the past: when President Bush expressed his hope for another lunar landing, thegeneral American response was boredom. Maybe it is the fact that there is not much exciting exploration left to be done. Then again it might be that the moon is not as interesting as, say, Saturn and the other planets we are now exploring. Nevertheless, July 20, 1969, will be a date America and the world remembers as the day we opened the door to space exploration.
