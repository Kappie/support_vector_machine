We ran into Shane, Brad, Allison, and Ben. Well me, Brad, and Shane were just minding our own business and got kicked out. So we all head over to Ben's for a bit, us via an automobile, them not. We chilled over there for probably 10 minutes or so, until Ashlee and Lauren decided to leave, following an incident involving bean launching, and me, being the devoted boyfriend I am, go with them. So I spent the rest of the day over there. Me and Ashlee had the greatest time lying on her bed doing nothing. Seriously.  Friday, me, Ian, Brad, and Brad K filmed most of our movie that may or may not work out. We had a pretty good time, but I had a bit of a reality check regarding authority. Namely that I'm a stupid teenager that no adult could possibly be expected to give a shit about. We walked up to Quick Stop to ask if they'd mind if we filmed a couple seconds of our film, and this is her exact response: "No, not at all...I mean, I do mind." So we were all like, "Uhh...k." So we walk down to Oak Grove Park, right? We decide to film a scene of me freaking out on that amphitheater, for no particular reason. Yeah, this silly Gladstone Parks and Recreation guy bitches at me for kicking the gate. Come on, man! That thing is fucking sturdy! So we film some more stuff in the park, finishing most of it, but we have to wait for Knoch to get there to film his shit. Well a damn police officer comes up to us and says how there are people saying we were going in and out of the fucking bathroom with my camera, and how she thought we were filming the fucking kids playing on the playground. YEAH BITCH, I'M A FUCKING PEDOPHILE! But I'm a whore so I didn't say anything and put away my camera. We finished up at my house. But...not cool, man. Ashlee got really mad at me for blowing her off. It's cool now though.  Saturday...Ashlee came over. We played some Lemmings, watched some S times. I had to go to the ridiculously long Easter Vigil at my church. I'd never realized just how phony my damn church is. My priest  read every single prayer out of a fucking plastic binder. How can anybody take that seriously? After 3 hours of that, the only thought going through my head was FUCK RELIGION.  Today I went over to my grandma's house for an Easter "dinner." I love how people try so hard to keep things traditional. At some point you need to just accept that things aren't how they used to be. It was my family, my grandma, my uncle, and two cousins. The entirety of my dad's side of the family. Why do we even bother? Communication/eye contact was kept to a minimum. Luckily, my uncle brought his pirated Chappelle's Show DVD, and we all had a good time with that. Best show on TV.  And tomorrow. My mom is making me go to the doctor because of a blister I have on my foot from DDR. Not too sure why. Me and Ashlee are going head over to Oak Park's track and do a little running. Since she has her meet there and stuff on Tuesday. Should be fun.  Anyway. Happy Easter. I was just kidding about the religion thing. Jesus was good people.
