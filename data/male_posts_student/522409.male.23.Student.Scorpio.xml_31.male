I got to hang out with Jamie (my freshman yr roommate and one of the most loyal friends I've ever known) and Danielle. (a good friend who now has a really badass job with the government while she's still a student at UNH.)  I'm arranging "Grey Street" for them, and sending them my arrangement of "Neon."    I went to a really great rally in Manchester last night.  It was an NRA rally and Charlton Heston spoke.  It was incredible.  I have not fel that energized in... forever.  And yes, Meredith, I know you're jealous, but it's all the more reason to stick around me during election years is all I'm saying.  Giuliani, Heston... c'mon now.  I've got someone on my mind, and she's not going away.  Gah.  Not that I really want her to... it'd just make things easier for right now.  Eh... whatever.  It's nice to feel like this.  So my time with the NHGOP starts this weekend.  It's going to be a good weekend for a bunch of reasons.  1) NHGOP, 2) Ellis's party, 3) Nate's cocktail party, 4) Sunday's an extra-special day :)... and 5) I get to spend time with my whole family, as Mary's coming to Boston for the party Friday night and will be home in NH til probably Sunday night.  Life's... nice.  I'm going to bed now, as I have to work a double tomorrow, and have to drive home after that.  Sooooo...  Oh yeah.  Thanks, Jamie, for my very exciting presents :)  They'll be on my computer shortly.  Muahahahaha.  Talk to you all soon.  IM me (JazzmnJim) if you read this and don't know me.  Since I have no other way of knowing how many people read this and my curiosity is... well... I'm curious.  That's all.  G'night all.  J
