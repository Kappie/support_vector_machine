Nah, Dave is still god of acoustic.  I have been flat out fawking stressed at work the past two days.  I must have cooked over 5000 dollars in food, and made a bout a billionth of it in tips.  Last night I got 4 dollars, tonight...the big zip.    Anyway.  I'm beginning preparations for the SAT.  I think I'll take it in Nov. and keep on until I'm satisfied.  If you guys have ANY helpful information with studying or anything related to the SAT, please email me @: tbrenner@gmail.com .  Who Likes the new opening image?  I do.
