But i believe i have a good personality. Maybe not... But i consider myself a nice person. But let me get to the point. Yesterday and the day before i was talking to this girl LaTonya which like really much. I mean we both cant say love because u know, to young. But I really like her but im not sure if she likes me. So at the end of school dance  or u can say party. Im trying to stay with her because i really wanted to come over to her house (u have a nasty mind). but im always gettin blocked out of her way with some bigger dude. But since i have the coolest mom in the world, she picked me up early for no reason  and brought me home. But before i left i gave LaTonya a hug and i asked her to call me. No Call. So I call up Jessica, one of my other friends and say...Nothin. Shes gone to. But their not out of town. So i call and call but i keep getting "shes not home right now, can i take a message." But I call and call and then one of her friends online tells me that shes home, just doesnt wanna answer u. GRRRRRRR!! That made me pissed. Because i went through alot just over the summer and i need someone to be there to comfotrt me or just to talk to. But then i tried Latonya one last time... Halajleuh!! She picked up and was surprised i called. Ummm. Ive Only been calloing for the past 2 weeks. I guess her family didnt want me to talk to her. But anyway... im talking to her havin a good convo and were just chillin talking. when she says she'll call me back. Surprisingly from her mood she doesnt call back. So i wait till the next day and hear she fell asleep before she could call me back. UmmHmm. So were there talking again and she says can she call me back, my "grandma" is on the phone. No call back. And I still havent called her back. So from hearing all this and letting all this stuff out. Why. Why. Why. Why do girls (not all girls) just playt men like dogs. And for some reason (some) girls think that ALL men will disapoint them. well Scrool up or down or watever to hear wats been going on inside another episode of "the Jacksons" a Negro Story. LOL  Im So sorry for making u read so much but its good for u. Jessica. She is my latest EX. And she played me too. She said yes to me but everytime i tried to do something with her. She turn me away. Nobody knew, because she didnt tell no one. And She made up lies like my brother was going to beat her sister up if she didnt go out with me. Which definatly wasnt true.   But I dont know How i can but 13 years of drama into one post so ill see u later.
