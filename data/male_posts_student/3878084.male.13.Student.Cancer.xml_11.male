The reason is, bcuz Andrew told me about wat he was doing so i went to the jcc to b a chaperone for the lil kidz.  The thing is these kids R 2,3,4 years old.  So u can already guess that they r annoying and i thought that it was probaly goin to b He||.  But it wasnt. But the thing is when i left alot of them started to cry so i didnt knoe wat to do so i told that i would b bac on monday so they all quit crying thats why i am gonna do it for the rest of da summer. Plus their not that bad i knoe wat am i saying, and no i did not convert over to jewish to go there.  I juss had to tell u that.  Ceasar got a bath today.  Like u care. Well we went to Harry potter 3 then we went to eat at Brews Room.  Then we went to walk on the beach which i dont knoe why.  Last I am talking online later.                 Peace ChrisB
