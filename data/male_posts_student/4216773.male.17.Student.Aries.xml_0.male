(ask me about what i mean by saving up) it's pretty good, for being 100% remixed material. anyways.. got home from work, signed on to messenger, this pops up:  Tessa - (add some crazy lil sister shit here):     when r u coming to pick me up? mortimerjones: (add some crazy geek shit here):     oh shit.. when did you want me to do that??  so yeah.. i forgot that i had to go get my sister after work. went to olivia, made my car go fast again (add r-ckl-s- e-dang-rm-nt to my record, please, officer.) and got back in time to see laura in her natural habitat -- work! no, i'm j/k. although she does work a lot, i do too.. :( laura leaves on sunday. it's sad. i think i might cry. i hope mom makes that appointment. anyways. i'm really hyper, so i think i'll go make fun of chat room people. nite
