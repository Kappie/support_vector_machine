I guess, sad thing, is now that he explained it, I realized I really can't talk about it, and that most things in life tend to be conspiratol.  Damn.  I could look deeper into it, but trust me, it goes pretty deep.  Hmmm... let's change to philosophy for a second.  I was thinking, as I often do, what's the point of life.  Why did life evolve into progressively more complicated forms.  The easy answer is, our way of thinking is wrong, and that they're less complicated, or something else that wouldn't make sense from our perceptions angle.  But the one that made sense to me, is that everyone wants to be immortal.  That's why single cells multiply, and don't just starve and die off.  Life wants to replicate itself, so that it'll continue forever.  The thing about a single cell is that it's easy to kill.  So I'm assuming cells originally joined together for protection, but in the process they lost themselves as individuals.    So what's the point of that?  Cells could die out, so can more difficult life related things.  So that's why, I think, all life forms are so content on reproducing, the cells want to live on forever.  It's hella more complicated then that, but since all cells descended from the same cell, or cells, it's logical to assume that all living things came from a few cells that wanted to live forever.  Interesting, I guess.   Also, FNL Preview at School in Action Night tommorow.  It's gonna be hot, and they're gonna be mad girls with the fatties and packed booties man.  So come.
