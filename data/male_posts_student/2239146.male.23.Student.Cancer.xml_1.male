Once again, those anointed by God to wear the mantel of the prophet will become sought after by elected officials for direction, guidance, and/or advice.  This Generation will hold itself accountable for the words they speak.  This Generation will step-up and confess any flesh that seeped into the words God gave them.  This Generation will restore the office of the prophetic.  It is this Generation that the prophetic  must  because it is  this  Generation that is lead the battle to retake land that has been held within the enemies grasps for so long.  But remember this Generation, remember that you must walk with your eyes looking towards heaven, towards God.  Remember this Generation, that you must remain as humble as Moses.  Remember this Generation, I have called you to be a uniting factor for all generations on this earth.  You cannot...you  will not  do this alone.   You require the wisdom that I will impart unto you, you require the wisdom of those whom I have placed around you.  Do not become complacent or prideful in what I have given you, for you will surely fall if you do.  Surrender yourself to Me and I will continue to build you up, I will continue to use you to speak My Word to this Nation, all Nations.  I am calling you to restore the faith in the prophetic, for it is this prophetic that will be integral to the battle that must be won on earth.
