I thought that I saw the Clarion bus heading for Humboldt...but chose not to say anything. It turns out that Clarion had packed up, and headed to Humboldt thinking that our game was there. Unfortunately  IT WASN'T ! We didn't have any ref's to ref our game when Clarion finally got back...so we just headed home. What a load of crap if you ask me...
