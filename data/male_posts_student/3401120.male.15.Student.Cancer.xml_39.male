I mean i even got high. i mean it was on fingernail polish but i did it. I am so over him. How did i fall for that @$$ hole? I think it was his pretty eyes and just his beginning sweetness... he totally changed. I will miss my Boo but Kurt i can't stand him. He told my cousin he was gay.... the best for him. If any guy is stupid enough to go with him best wishes for them.   You might wonder who said all that shit huh? well it was the stupid ass dana, i was reading her diary at student center to see what kind of shit was she talkin about me and i found this out. I think thats not nice, dana if you're reading this, i never told you to get high. And you know it, just becuz i emailed her once to tell her i got high, doesnt mean she had to do it too. Now if i tell her to jump off a cliff, im sure she will do it. Never thought someone could be such a backstabber. Yes, i used to get high on wood glue, but i dont think i ever told anyone to do the same, i never changed anyone, its not the way i work. and i never told that faggot i was gay, NEVER. And dana, you're one who gets the fucked up relationships, poor idiot the one who dates you. I fuckin hate when people does this.
