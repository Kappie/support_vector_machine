OOoo...  After that, we came home. Then, I rushed off to meet CQ, Gloria, YH and Joyce at Woodlands Stadium to play some basketball and badminton. Yeah. I arrived there and they were still waiting for XC. HaHa. We played some football (where I was the goalkeeper and all 4 of them were trying to shoot in the ball, which was provided by Joyce). Meow meow!!  After that, we went to the Woodlands Stadium. Joyce, Gloria and YH went out to run on the track (or rather, walk), while me and Ji went out to wait for XC. Hm...after waiting and walking till 12pm, we buay tahan le. We were so hungry, so we left for lunch. I called my brother to give XC my HP number, in case XC calls my home (he likes to do that one la).  We went to the coffeshop far beyond, and each step was killing. I was so so so hungry. I ordered chicken rice and root beer. Ah Ji passed me Janet's present, asking me to give it to her when I am going home.   Then, after lunch, it was 1. We walked back to the badminton stadium and booked 2 courts for an hour.  We played badminton and called WQ to come down (he refused to return me $1. I pay for the courts ma...everybody owed me $1. He said "I never said I am coming down to play!!" and hanged up on me! Excuseeee me! Never said? Oh my my!! tsk tsk!). CQ had to go back to oversee some fixing of his SCV cable. We played till 2 lor.  We were about to go back, until XC called and say he just arrived. So late! He proposed playing basketball, so we all agreed lor. He arrived soon after, followed by CQ and his brother. We went to a basketball court near WQ's house and started playing. WQ also came down to play. We played and played (have some rest in between) and stop at around 4.  Me, Gloria, YH and XC took the 911 bus towards Causeway Point. YH went home in the MRT, the rest of us walekd towards CWP. Then, in a throng of people, we lost XC. Can't find him, so me and Gloria went up to Popular to give Janet her gift. We even had to queue to give Janet CQ's gift (makes Janet look like a very important person. HaHa!!). Then, we went home by the 913 bus.  I came back home, took a bath, went online, then went for dinner and came back to watch TV. Oh my god!! OK No Problem is showing its last episode!! Why so many good shows end during this time de? Ayioh!! So good that show! I will miss the episodes. ~Starts hoping for another season~   Okay. Gotta go le. Watch Survivor and all. So exciting! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
