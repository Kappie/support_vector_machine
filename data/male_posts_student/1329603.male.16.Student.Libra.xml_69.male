There was a little bit of flirting last night but that's because I fancy her a lot. Well, there was a LOT of flirting last night. I would LIKE to go out with her, sure. But while Gwen maintains that she'd be upset if I made 'a move' and Miller maintains tha she doesn't fancy me I feel it would be fruitless, and I must therefore turn my efforts to a back up plan. Of which I have none.  Secondly, I've only just got back from a band rehearsal. It went alright.  A GYWO concert may clash with The Last Laugh, which would be awful.  I am completely knackered.  Great. Now I'm thinking about Miller AGAIN.  ...Gwen told me Danni and Sam were at Koinonia and they were both very huggy towards each other. In fact, the comparison she used is that it was like me and Sam used to be. I could have done without that. Jesus, I could have done without that. I also could have done without Danni being talked at last night about her exploits with Sam at the orchestra course. I could have fucking done without being told she went with other people too. I could have fucking done without it. I could... I could do without every waking moment being filled with the fact that I'm not only single, but my ex-girlfriend cheated on me, went out with one of my friends and then cheated on him. I could now do without the fact that the girl I most want to be with is untouchable under the morals I have about upsetting people. Fuck.  I feel very ill.  It seems strange to say it but I kind of want Zoe to walk in and give me a hug. I don't understand why but she's so bloody comforting to have near me. I suppose I've known her for too long. Not that that's a bad thing. I like her, that's obvious by the fact I want her near me.  I feel like the end is closer than I used to think.  Gr, I'm so fucking depressed tonight. I could do without living right now.  Quote of the day: "And you ask me why I love her Through wars, death and despair, She is the constant, we who don't care."
