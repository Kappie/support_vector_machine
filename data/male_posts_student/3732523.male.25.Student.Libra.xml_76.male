I feel like our's is still going because it's Tuesday and Paul is still at home:) I LOVE having my husband here at home:) I'm not ready for him to go back tomorrow. I've been spoiled.   Our weekend started out on Friday:) The kids and I picked Paul up from work early. It is impossible to go anywhere fast in the summer. It took us an hour and a half to get into Chicago. It usually takes, at the most, 45 minutes. Anywhoo, so we picked Paul up from work at 4pm and went to the Taste of Chicago:) It's Chicago's biggest festival. It runs from the Friday week before July 4th and ends at 9pm on the 4th. This year something like 4 million ppl showed up. Local restaurants set up their booths up and down Columbus Drive and around Grant Park. There are different stages for different performers and every night there is a big name that performs at the Petrillo Music Shell:)   WELLLLL, I was so excited because PAT BENETAR was performing Friday night:) So we got there and walked around for a bit. The kids got grapes and we got ice cream that was realllly soooo good:) After walking around the Taste for a little bit, we headed across to the lakefront and walked up and down there looking at the yachts and other assorted boats. Chicago is so pretty. The lakefront is amazing. If I didn't get so seasick from being on a boat, I'd have me a yacht and park myself out there all summer long. But, alas, I get sick just watching the boats bobble.*sigh*. The weather was gorgeous as well. It was the lower 70's and the wind almost made it a bit chilly:) We were leaving to come home and heard Pat Benetar come to the stage so we tottled on over to the Grant Park to watch and listen:) It was such a cool time:)   We got home about 9pm. Saturday we all went grocery shopping.. probably a huge mistake. It was the day before the 4th and everybody and their brother was at the grocery store. Sunday was the fourth and we went to the fair at Highland's Central Park. We do this every year. The kids love it and they did have such a good time:) Yesterday we didn't do much of anything. Paul went mountain biking and last night we had date night:)   Apparently, Paul has never just gone for a drive. Going no where in particular. Just driving. So that's what we did yesterday. We started out toward St John and then went past there to Cedar Lake then across to Lowell and then up to Merrillville:) We stopped at the Outback in Merrillville and had supper then came home. I think that was one of the nicest dates we've had:) I havent been riding in quite a while and I think he enjoyed it himself:)   Today I've been doing stuff for the garage sale. Paul has been working from home. They launched the Women of Home Depot *big eye roll* today and he's on call to make sure there aren't any serious glitches.   So there is our weekend. It's been a long one, but I'm not ready for it to end just yet. I have been spoiled I guess:).  Hope everyone else had a nice one as well:)  take care
