Summer is repetitive, blogging doesnt work so well in the sumer, but hark, 3 more weeks and school raises its ugly head back up.  Ive been getting tons of random bug bites over the last few days. i NEVER get bug butes, but it seems there are at least 2 new ones every day now, and the weird thing is they are ALL on my left arm except for one on my right hand and another on my left ear. at first i thought i might have the chicken pox again or something, but its concentration to the left arm seems to rule that out. and they arent spots, they are just bumps. maybe ill just cut my left arm off.  tip for the day: fill a water bottle with gasoline and seal it up, then run down carmel beach looking for someone with a fire and throw it in. be sure to run far away as you will be wanted for murder.
