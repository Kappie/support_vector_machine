I thank you for the pain you put onto me when you take away what I had, so that I can see the pain I brought onto others.  I thank you for not letting me keep what I had, so that I can prepare for what you will arrange for me.  I thank you for the pain of being lied to, so that I can be honest.  I thank you for all the care people have for me when I was weak, so that I can see who really cares for me.  I thank you for showing me the foolishness of my own choosing, so that I can see your wisdom.  I thank you for all the burden you laid on me, so that I can become a better person.  I thank you for not making my path easy, so that I can appreciate your grace.  I thank you for keep hatred from entering my heart, so that I can keep you in it.  I thank you for keeping me faithful, so that I can wake up every morning without guilt.  I thank you for keeping me earnest, so that I can see the sweetness of life.  I thank you for keeping me devoted, so that I can see the treasure of a pure heart.  Finally, lord, I thank you for the grace you laid upon me, for I'm not worthy of it.  We pray so in the Lord's name.  Amen.
