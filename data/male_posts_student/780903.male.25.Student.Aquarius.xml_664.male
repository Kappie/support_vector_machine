I'll post something longer then, no worries.  I've got the first 300 words of something percolating in my head.  Good callback today, I liked the people.  I don't what else there is to go on.  I keep running into classmates of mine at these firms' offices (not surprising), in the subway stations (more surprising), and randomly passing on the street (kind of surprising).
