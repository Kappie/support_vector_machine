We had dinner at the Eiffel Tower Resturant, which was excelent as always. Then we headed off to Prom. It was cool inside the LV Villa. It was kinda small though. Damn did Liberace know how to live. His bathtub was HUGE! Well, I have posted pictures online. I hope you like them. Another post is coming soon after I get the pictures off the dig. cam. I GOT MY BUNGKWIFA license plates!?!?!?!?!?!?!   urlLink  PROM 2004
