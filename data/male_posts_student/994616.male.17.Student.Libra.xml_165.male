Of course the "real 9/11" devalues the  18,000 people who die a day from hunger or a related cause.   The bush admin spend 40 billion on its army for two things 1) the war on terror and 2) saddam hussein. So lets say  half of that went to fighting terrorism because of the twin towers. That's about 20 Billion Dollars. That could sponsor 714 285 children for a month.  /rant  I have the best lecture on mondays. It's for my introduction to texts which could be an incredibly boring subject, but so far he hath shown us the tongue commercial, read to us a story about billy and the barglebogle, and a range of other very spiffy stuff. The only problem is that i always start thingking and coming up with ideas. Damn manipulative lecturer.
