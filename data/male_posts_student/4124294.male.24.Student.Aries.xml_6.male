Anyway, I'm at uni now, getting all stressed out over assignments and lack of time to do all the things I really wanna do which could be construed as time-wasting. Y'know, things like stuffing my face with junk food, lounging about while reading, staring at the ceiling, stuff like that. Sigh. Oh well, I have to get back home to work on another project for school (I'm in uni right now, in the overstuffy computer lab)... so I'll leave you with a silly cartoon, drawn by yours truly.    For another cartoon, click  urlLink here  and  urlLink here !
