It's always the same... I'm always the one who is lame.  Damn it all... Damn them all. Yet... In reality, The one that needs to be blamed is me.  I can't change myself, I can't be better, I can't be charming, Yet... I can't stop transforming. I want to be loved, I want to be noticed, I want to be the one who has the charm, I want to be the one who is warm. I want to be everything you want me to be.  People have told me that if I would be myself... I would be loved by the people around me. Yet that is so lame, That is what I am trying to blame... Being myself is lame.
