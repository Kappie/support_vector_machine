I tried to be reassuring and stuff, but then she said something like "it's your fault" or a similar stupid comment. That's when I piled in her. Of course they fired you; you can't hold a job. You probably didn't work hard enough. Hey, maybe you can get a new job cleaning houses, so other people's places will be just as sparklingly unclean as ours. She was unfazed. Just another Thursday at the house.
