On friday i brought a razor to school for andrea to cut 'hallice' into my hair, but i didnt see here most of the day (i ate lunch with gal only). we got out of bio early, cause we had tot ake a standardized test with a substitute, and so we sat in a hallway and she cut a bald spot, a happy face, and a band around my leg. nice. after shcool, i stayed til 4 with tutor. then i sat with jen for 20 mins (she was there to watch a game at 6) and took two of her pills. they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!! on tuesday, after my english final, im taking 3 no doubt. ill see if that does anything to make me happy.   yeah.  my mom found my writing on the wall. she said 'os writing on your wall your new thing?"  i guess.  "well i dont think you should do it."  why not? its not like all over the room.  "oh, youre not gonna cover your walls with it?"  no.  "ok"...she was fine with it ig uess. but she checks what i write. i wrote 'my fan doesnt match' and she started tlaking to me about it later. i got a fan. its metallic with a blue neon light. the first night i put it on and read under it, and i was afraid id have dreams about aliens. but its cool..   i burned part of my carpet with incense on like wednesday. that was fun. it wasnt on purpose tho...lol   no, im not that cool. but i did check out jens bong. at church ill see if i can ask adrienner for some of her mj to put it in. mjs better than speed...  yes. lol. not that i would know.
