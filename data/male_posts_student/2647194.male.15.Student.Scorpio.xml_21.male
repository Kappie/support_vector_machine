Weekend recap: Friday: Looking forward to a weekend with minimal homework, I went over to Dan's place to play magic and halo with him and Josh (yet again). I ended up arriving back home at the lovely hour of midnight. I honestly think Josh needs to work on his trading skills...  Saturday: I basically lounged around all day, did my chores, didn't do my homework, and thought about going skiing for the evening. I ended up not going. I didn't go anywhere on Saturday, but even yet the night was fun. Yep, I'm an AIM addict-majorly.  Sunday: I completed that weekend's homework in the car going to and from church, which was followed by a a pilgrimage to Afton Alps with Matt and Dan. We are the trifector, the kings of the bowl, the masters of big air-whatever you want to call us...lol Yeah, basically we're just really really insane people who are wrongly handed a pair of skis. Crash of the day: When cutting across a run, with me a little ways behind Matt, Matt colided with a woman snowboarder. Her board clipped his skis, sending her flying through the air to a harsh landing on her back/head, with no helmet mind you. So while the three of us were waiting next to her, her "big and bad" boyfriend arrived. I explained what happened. Exerpts from the conversation: "You kids better watch where the fuck you're going!" "Get the fuck out of here!" And yet, she wasn't wearing a helmet, it was an accident, and only one of us was in the damned crash in the first place. Tell me how does that merit this guy transforming into a huge jackass?!  Okay, back to the now. Daily recap:  Math: I discovered today, yes after a full semester of not knowing, that we could use our notes on the tests. And yet, I still managed all A's on them-huh?  Science: I guess this week could be called "Simian Week", since we're studying all of the primates that we, as a human race, are killing off by destroying their habitat in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, among other places. Mrs. Bartlett somehow managed to misplace my permission slip too-at least I'm fairly sure of it-so now I have to pay again. Como Zoo should be fun-seeing how apes react to new toys and foods and such.  Band: Well, it depends on what band you're talking about. In regular band, I finished all of my pre-calc homework, thanks to the vast black void of rest bars that implanted themselves on my part to Berceuse and Finale-The Firebird Suite. As for Jazz Improv, we were officially christened "The Random" at today's rehearsal. That's been our long-standing idea for a name, and it's about time it went through. If I am correct, The Random, along with other random bands will be performing at MSA's Jazz Coffeehouse on April 13th. Everyone needs to come. Yes, that means you. Oh-and you over there-yeah you-you need to show up or else.  Spanish: This upcoming test is going to be rather of a big b@!#%, according to Nathaniel. The random spanish funnies of the day have returned!: 1. Again, Matt is the source of this one. When asked repeatedly what the answer of a question was, while he "struggled" with getting the right answer, he stuck in a few "penis"s here and there. The whole right side of the classroom couldn't help from laughing violently. 2. After Eric got all of the verbs and more wrong in answering a question, after which Mrs. Sustic had CLEARLY explained everything, we were assigned that section as homework-it was quite a bit. Nathaniel's and my responses: "Nice listening, Eric."  English: We started reading the next chapter in To Kill a Mockingbird in the format of "reader's theatre", in which people get the parts. I formidably received the role of Narrator-I'm a fairly good speaker anyhow.  Social: The Crusades are currently receiving the honor of being the subject of Jam-master Shoeb's classes for 9th grade...lol. I wonder if we'll cover the search for the holy grail...  "That's enough of that!"
