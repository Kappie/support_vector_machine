This morning i went to church and afterwards i went to O'Charley's with Melinda and her mom, which is always great. When i came home i went straight to bed, it was probly about 1 and i slept till 5. Then i got ready and went to church, where Hanna-Grace gave me a picture she drew for me.........quite funny.  After church we went out to eat with the few of us that were there. It was melinda, me, joe, and amory and we went to graffiti's pizza. The food was good, but expensive and it was loud in there too. Isnt life grand!
