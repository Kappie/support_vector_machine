I have been appointed to investigate if my cousin, Anita Marahatta needs a laptop. I interviewed her on May 23, 2004. She told me that for her laptop is not a necessity but rather it is a “want.” She stated that her life would be more “comfortable” and “easier” with her owing a laptop. Anita is currently engaged in an Internet Website building course. She wants a laptop where she can work alone without having anyone to share the computer with. This sounds to me like that Anita wants a laptop just to make her life easier. But lets not forget that, isn’t this what all of us want? Don’t all us want to make our life easier? I can hear all of you cheering and saying “Yes.” What the hake! Let’s give Anita a laptop.
