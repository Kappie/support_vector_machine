LoL! i had been totally bored, and i needed to watch a good movie with an awesome friend right at that point (things have been kinda bad on the old western front)...so, he told me he would be over in like an hour or so. when he showed up, we finished watching miss congeniality (awesome movie duh), and then turned the movie on. of course, it was great, and i shed a few tears here and there---didnt let anyone see though. nicole, kirstens character, really reminded me of myself: a rebel who can't do anything right. no matter how hard she wanted to change her image, no one was willing to accept that SHE COULD change, so she had no more hope--she didnt care anymore--ppl would always have that tainted view of her. tim kept hitting himself, and hitting me each time i would cap on myself--he's trying "some radical new therapy" ("what about bob?" movie line), and it seems to be working...either i cap on myself, or i get a bruised shoulder! you guys know me! come on now--im vain, so i had to stop LoL!! we're working on it though...im a challenge, i know that much is true. but anyways, after the movie was over, tim had some dinner (it was like 9), and my mom was BEGGING me all day to go to starbucks. we went to the gas station to fill up the SICKEST JEEP OF ALL TIME, and then went to starbucks. tim had a rice krispy, and my mom decided not to get something AFTER all--oh well, i needed my caffeine fill for the day LoL!! (camp--good times hehe)....after that, we came back home and the 3 of us were supposed to watch "Mystic River", but my mom flaked and went to bed like hecka early--dunno why! tim and i stayed up looking at the yearbook, and seeing if he knew anyone! he only knew like 1 person, but still it was mucho fun. he left around like 11 or so, and i gave him something i HOPE he liked, but we'll see--im not an artsy person! LoL--suzy, if you're reading this my some weird instance, remember when i couldnt even make the beaded bracelet last summer? LoL! im TOTALLY "craft challenged" haha!! well, its time for me to get to bed. ive gotta run a few errands today, do some drivers ed online, prob have tim over again, play softball, come home and watch "Mystic River", then walk to laura's house----we gotta talk, me and my sister. praying for you Laura--luv ya white stuff.
