We drove - well I drove and he navigated - to about 15 miles away down all sorts of country lanes and basically followed a river throughout its course, taking readings as we went along. We both got wet to begin with, but the river got larger and larger, making most parts of it practically immeasurable. It was good fun though, as the sun was shining and driving down all the crazy lanes was interesting.    Thursday was spent at work doing till training, for a reason that I've yet to uncover. I'm normally a lifter, but now it seems that they want to train me up to be more flexible or something. Hmm... Anyway, it was dead easy and I can't believe that cashiers get paid  more  for doing such less work. I'm off to work tomorrow as well, and there's a new guy who I'll be my deputy (not officially, but practically), so that'll be interesting. I'm just hoping that he won't be as dull as one of the lifters on Sundays. We'll see tomorrow anyhow...    Today was basically a day off from everything, mainly spent doing work on Thunderbolt. I solved a really annoying disc space problem and wrote up my  Transport Giant  review, then played  Army Men: Sarge's War , which was disappointing to say the least. I then wrote up 80% of the review for that.    Right, off to bed, since I'll have to be up and early tomorrow.   Holidays... soon!
