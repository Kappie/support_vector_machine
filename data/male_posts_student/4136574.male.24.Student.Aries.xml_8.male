My relatively good mood continued. It was nice talking to Erin on the way there and back. I didn't get to see her much besides that. Lisa was great. I had a blast throwing ideas at her and really making headway into what's going on in my life. She was very kind and I had a great time at her place all weekend.  Wow, okay... it's later and I'm still too lazy to write about it.  Good sign maybe.  Writing flows well from problems and moods.  I'm not in a writing mood anymore.  This blog may die one day soon.  Or maybe I'll get internet and be more able to write.
