I suggest checking out "Jeremy and the Bobcat," "Mindreader," and "Evan Eschmeyer (DNP)."  Neat and fun stuff, kind of reminiscent of They Might Be Giants.  Also, on the local music tip, if you haven't heard the  urlLink Two Dollar Pistols , you really ought to check them out.  John Howie's voice is awesome, and the band's wicked tight.  My personal recommendation is  You Ruined Everything , but their newest album is sweet, too.
