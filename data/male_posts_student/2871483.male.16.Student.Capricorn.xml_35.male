I mean, not really quickly, and not really dragging.  Just...unreal, maybe.    -  I had a really bad episode with myself during English Class.  I was looking at the forcasting sheet, and I realized that I need to crunch things in and I really don't know how the hell I'm going to do it, especially after stupidly failing English.  I don't know if I can take much more of it, before I'm just going to explode.  -  Mrs. Klaas can really be a bitch.  I mean, if she's not teaching, she's really nice, easy to get along with.  But when she's teaching, oh man, she's a fucking nightmare.  Since failing, she and my dad have been emailing back and forth, so I don't screw up again.  And now she's using it against me.  "I'm sorry, Mrs. Klaas, I swear, I got it signed, I just forgot to bring it today.  I forgot my whole English binder."  "Oh, well I guess your dad will be hearing about this."  (What a bitch.)  And the worse part is, she says it so the whole class hears it, and it's really embarassing.  I don't think ANYONE should have to deal with that.  -  And in dealing with that stupid dilemma of mine, I don't think I'm quite over it.  The problem lies in the fact that they're not both in the same classes...  -  You know, my life has been so fucked up this year, I need to take a serious break.  Not talk to anyone, not go to school, just lie back in bed, and have nobody barge in and bother me.  It would be paradise.  Some peace and quiet....
