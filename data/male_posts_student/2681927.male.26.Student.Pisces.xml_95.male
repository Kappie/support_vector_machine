But in my opinion, that question* is impossible to answer. Armstrong won six years in a row, struggled against and defeated cancer the years before his first victory and so on. But how do one compare his achievemens with, say  urlLink Jacques Anquetil ,  urlLink Eddy Merckx ,  urlLink Bernard Hinault  and  urlLink Miguel Indurain  who won the TdF five times plus various other important competitions? Merckx for instance, alsowon Giro d'Italia five times, Vuelta Espa√±a once and three World Championships.   And what about  urlLink Fausto Coppi who "only" won twice in the Tour de France, but five times in the Giro d'Italia. He started his career in the beginning of the second World War but then thewar interrupted the competitions.  All theseare great cyclists, and will (and should) be remembered and admired as such. But to say that anyone of them is better than the rest is highly dubious in my opinion.   * Rather, such questions, because there are many in the same "area". Who was the worst, Hitler, Stalin, Mao or Pol Potis another.
