I logged in into SecondLife this morning, bumped into my friends and they were able to talk me through testing my setup on the test radio server. I was one of the easiest thing ever and soon they could hear my Winamp playlist going and even my mike setup seemed to be fine, maybe a bit loud but thats better than being too soft.  Now armed with my password and login, I'm all set to start Djing, all thats left is to find and book a good time slot. Easier said than done with the time difference and my oncoming workload. Just have to play it by ear, pardon the pun.
