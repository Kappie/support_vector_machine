Anyway, yes, sorry, won't be on MSN, which is more than bad, 'cause I can't talk to LFZN or anyone else, so... lame.  The Les Mis rehearsal on Wednesday ruled, and I'm just about counting the hours until the Sunday rehearsal. I think this is one of these situations where I'd appreciate time speeding up just a little. But yes, very much looking forward to it. It's not just the music, I really, genuinely like pretty much everyone there. Admitedly Christine (Mme. T)scares me a little, but still... Naomi, Liv, Jack, Phil, Christine, Mike, Bali, Rhiannon, and all the people I don't know the names of, you all rule, and none of you read my blog. Hoorah!  12 days 'til my Grade 8.  Quote of the day: "It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool, It's you who must forgive a thankless man... It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint. When they wounded me, He took me from the barricade, Carried, like a babe, And took me home to you."  From   The Epilogue   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
