Well anyway. camp was good as usual. My third year there... I don't know if it was the best year, but it was a good one. My team won the championship (yay!). During the regular league games we were 7-2, but in most of our games I only scored like 2-4 points except for one when I was on fire and scored 10 points. Yay me, but anyway it was a good week and I'm ready for more basketball now. Hope you all had fun while I was gone and hope I talk to you soon.   Love you all
