I’m tired of being hurt. Tired of  the world. Tired of believing only to be proved wrong. Brandy I know ‘m not wrong about her Carmen I know she’s a great person Sofia….gret in everyway  as well. So these three people are gonna have to carry me on through atleast another year. I’m weaker and more vulnerable than ever before. I’m tired of people dropping by for a month and fucking me up. It’s war upon humans now, and I can’t lsoe if I close up I was gonna wait till CP to do that…but it starts now. Thank you Meily….for being my inspiration behind this cause
