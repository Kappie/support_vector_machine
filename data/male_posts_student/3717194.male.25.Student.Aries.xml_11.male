So the question becomes then, why are they my favorite band?  The lyrics.  Something about the liberal use of metaphors (and sometimes just plain nonsense, it seems...at least to me) allowsone to hear their music in many different ways. One person's heartbreaker is another person's love song; one person's get-fired-up song is another person's chill out song.One example:   When I here the song  Round Here , and Adam strains the words, '...round here, she's always on my mind,' I have an instant flash of every girl I've ever lost to stupid pride, fear, or just geographical and timing differences. It is always a pleasant reflection. For some, it is not pleasent; for others, it elicits no response at all.   Ok, hopefully, my minor emotional jog did not bore my massive readership. I will try to keep the blogs more fun.  I would encourage anyone to read Counting Crows Lyrics:  urlLink http://www.countingcrows.com/
