Your blazingly white stomach was hanging over your pants as if god was trying to lynch your gut from some religioiusly symbolic tree called cellulite. I watched you talk jive to that poop for hours. Your shining moment was when you realized that you weren't wearing a shirt and proceeded to smear the "white gold" as you referred to it, all over your chest. Now I know where those disgusting white heads on your tits came from. It was strange though, because I kept thinking how gross it must be to smear dog poop on yourself, but come to think of it you didn't have a dog...   -Gia
