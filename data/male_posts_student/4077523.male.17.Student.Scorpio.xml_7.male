Yesterday: Went to School, went to church afterwards. Got to be part of Security at the Concert. It was fun and the Concert Was Awsome. It was delayed for about 30 min. because of the sound check not being done. But, I had a great time, I got to keep some people a certain distance away from the stage and did some other things.      Today: School, and I am about to go to O'Charly's tonight. I will meet Tiff J. there and I just hope it won't be too boring at the Instrumental/Tech party. I don't think it will, it should be fun because we have an awsome group going, even if they are out of school and most married, haha. But they are awsome and a fun group to be around when you get them together, haha. Well anyway, I have to go do some stuff and get ready. God Bless, C-ya!
