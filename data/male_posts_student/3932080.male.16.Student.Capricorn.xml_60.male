Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Locked Up -Akon feat. Styles P.  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #31  Never before has their been a summer anthem so directly rooted in jail-time as  Akon’s  “Locked Up,” which profiles the artist’s continuing troubles with the law. As a vocalist,  Akon  plays his cards well like  Nelly ; neither can sing particularly well, but they draw attention with emotion in their inflections ( Nelly’s  sensual,  Akon’s  aching). Rocking a backbeat that sounds like  Eminem  remixed  Tupac’s  “Changes,” with misting strings and a clockwork derivative of that sampled piano lick,  Akon  narrates his problems like a cousin to  Kevin Lyttle  who’s sexuality is never questioning. Guest  Styles P.  does his own thing, rumbling through prison experience, but the show-stealer is the soulful chorus that, while slyly channeling  Michael Jackson’s  “Billie Jean,” updates millions of African-American spirituals sung to ease situational pain. This lurking jam may just rearrange your to-do list;  getting locked up  may have just inched above  getting knocked up.    The Verdict:  6.7/10 - The Fork   (3.35/5)
