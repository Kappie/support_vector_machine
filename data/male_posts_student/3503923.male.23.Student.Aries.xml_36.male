To go with our throw-away barbecue, we buy throw-away plastic sausages, politely labelled 'economy', but scientifically known as reconstituted animal meat from the floors of several second grade abattoirs. The promise goes: '45% of your sausage could be meat, the rest is definitely not.' And we love it, every last morsel, especially the carcinogenic ones; the ones that have slipped into kiss the embers when our tong grip gives way in the intensity of the flames, coated in a hard casing of utter blackness, decorated with a few flakes of ash, and so appealing to the eye.  So, over time, generations grow up thinking that this black stick, cleverly imitating a sausage, is the barbecue norm, and a delicacy to savour. We are doing our children a great disservice. They should be let in on a secret. Slow roasting pork tastes much nicer. You're very own spit-roast is easier to organise than you think. The raw materials for the feasting on a loin of pork festival are within touching distance. Do not throw away the sling-shots, that your children have been using to shoot you with, they will be the pillars that support your spit. The spit itself, a long skewer like object, could be anything, but I recommend a broom-stick stolen from your local witch; having of course beaten her with it first. Alternatively annoy your super clean granny by pilfering her Dustbuster Mark4 brush, utilising it to good effect as your spit.  We are nearly up and running. All you need now is a pig. Forget the Asterix like marauding in the forests. Forget the shop shelf. Forget becoming a farmer. All you need is love, you got it, love of kids. You'll ring up old friends, because you love baby-sitting their children. This couple you know, in addition to their charming children, also own a pet. A Pot Belly pig. They are delighted to have you over once more, as they can once again go to a quaint pub down the road. They leave you to your own devices, the children are well behaved and lovely, the night is progressing like a dream, but the pig upsets the apple-cart, setting in motion your cunning plan. The rampaging pig who has attacked you relentlessly, leaving ghastly bruises on your newly Immacced shins, has to pay. The pig violence justifies your actions, with clinical precision and the coldness of a calculated vetenary surgeon, you clobber the pig, bundling it into a sack. You smile to yourself, reflecting on the fate of the pig who upset the apple-cart, knocking dozens of perfectly good apples to the floor: the final destiny of the pig, being roasted with an apple in its mouth.  Sika ja se paistetaan... Sika ja me sita maistetaan...  Whatever you do kids, never play with fire or violent pigs, unless you want to have a spit-roast of course.
