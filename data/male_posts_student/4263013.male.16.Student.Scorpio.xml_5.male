EVERY OTHER GUY WAS JEALOUS AND  SHE LOVED THE ATTENTION..... HER GRANDMOTHER LEFT ISABELLA A  CHEST WITH A LOT OF SO CALLED "JUNK" IN IT. SHE FOUND MANY CHAIN LETTERS,  INCLUDING THIS ONE, AND THOUGHT WHAT EVERYONE  ELSE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM: "BRIEFLY  ADOICANTUIOUSLLY MYTHS" .. SO.... WHAT DO U THINK HAPPENED..... THE GROOM CALLED THE WEDDING  OFF ........ SHE THOUGHT "OH WELL I HAVE EVERY  OTHER GUY...." WELL DID SHE?...... NO EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE  PLANET DESPISED HER.....SHE WATCHED THE WORLD  AROUND HER CRIPPLE..... AND HER FAMILY DIED... :-( NOW WHAT SHE READ ON THE CHAIN  LETTER WAS THIS:   NOW YOU ARE SEEKED TO PASS THIS  ON. IT HAS BEEN PASSED ON 4 EVER, AND A PERSON WHO DOES NOT PASS  IT  ON SHALL HAVE A LOVE LIFE OF  COMPLETE  DEVER.  NOT ONLY NO A LOVE LIFE BUT  SICKNESS AND ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY. FOR YOU SHOULD THINK OF OTHERS  FIRST... BEFORE IT IS TO LATE!!!!!!!  NOW U GO TO FORWARD AT THE EDGE  OF YOUR SCREEN AND MAIL IT TO.... 10 PEOPLE ...AND WELL HERE LOOK AT  THIS:  IF U DO NOT PASS THIS ON AND TAKE IT  AS ANOTHER STUPID CHAIN LETTER THAN THE  FOLLOWING COULD HAPPEN...  1. THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE WILL BREAK  UP WITH U 4 NO REASON  2. A SPECIAL PERSON IN YOUR LIF E  WILL START SEEING SOMEONE ELSE AND LEAVE  U BE  3. YOUR LOVE LIFE WILL BREAK APART  AND NOT BE PUT TOGETHER IN AS MANY AS 4-5YEARS....
