Anyone can have an opinion about virtually anything. Institutions encourage us to consider the opinions they sell as "facts" and that we "believe" rather than question the morality they pitch. Friction between alternative belief structures is healthy in a polite society, and sometimes interactions that shoot off sparks conclude in consensus or a change of attitudes. But often these debates end up in stalemate with the opponents baiting each other and skipping reason altogether.  Benjamin Huff relates in The Te of Piglet:  A peasant and his son had their only horse run away from them. Neighbors said, "oh how sad!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?  The next day, the horse comes back to the farm, with four wild horses following in! The Peasant is lucky, and now owns five horses! Neighbors said, "oh how great!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?"  The next day, while trying to break one of the horses, the son is thrown by the horse. He breaks his leg; it won't heal for months. Neighbors said, "oh how sad!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?"  The next day, a great general came to town. He recruited, forcibly, any young man he could find, for a far-off war where most soldiers were going to die. But the son couldn't go; he had a broken leg! Neighbors said, "oh how great!" Peasant sez, "can it!"  Anyone who tells you what is good and what is evil, and judges on that behalf, is lying to you, implying that HIS perspective is the SAME as that of TRUTH, and not simply a subset thereof. Make up your own mind as to what you believe, rather than copypasting the beliefs of others into your brain.   This site is an exploration of alternative social ideas. I hope it makes you think about the ideas that frame your experience.
