I really have nothin interesting that i can think of to say right now, besides that i'm sitting here, freezing my ass off in my baggy jeans and a bodywarmer (no top underneath it - im being adventurous).  Okay stuff is starting to come to me...  Some irrelevant background knowledge (although if anyone has been stupid enough to read this they will soon turn away):  Badness is  not  good. Please remember this.  Okay so i'm a 16 year old gay guy living in just one of many busy parts of breezy Scotland. I'm an aspiring actor and playwright (in fact just remembered i was gonna write the penultimate scene of my gross-out comedy tonight...oh well...doin this instead), with a sense of humour that swings from bitter and witty to dirty and terribly bitchy. I am, if nothing else, honest. You have been warned.  However, i do warm up to people quite easily. I'm not an offensive person, but i stick to what i believe and will fight to the death for what i feel is right. Not an awful person. But i'm fuckin annoying!  Another universal truth to remember. Just because a boy is gay, it does not make him a girl. My little cousin would do well to think of this in future before making comments in front of the 5 year old cousin who adores me. Little slut. Seriously - too much sausage in too little skin. What twelve year old dresses like that at a first communion, i ask you?!  Bloody hell.  Time to go.
