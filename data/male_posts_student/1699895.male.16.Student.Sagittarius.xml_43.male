But today looked like it was going to rain, and then it turned out nice, so I just chilled today and didn't go to phils, since evan had hockey anyways. Also went to Seante to get some extreme chili dogs since they are the finest in the world.  four day weekend this weekend, and SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER! I can't wait.
