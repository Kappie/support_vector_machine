It seems me missing all of my fantasy drafts has been a tradition the past 2 years. Figures I get the guy who raped a woman. Anyway in football news, Giants are playing Vikings this week. Everyone is talking about the curses in the MLB, but honestly. There has to be some sort of curse on the Giants. "Outstanding run by Barber to bring the Giants to the 5 yard line. Here goes the snap....OH MY! Collins fumbles the ball and the defense recovers." How many times have we heard this. Or how many times have we watched the special teams ruin a game. Well, actually I don't think there's a curse. The Giants are just that bad. But then again, all of my sports teams seem to suck. Knicks, Bulldogs, Giants.. *sigh*
