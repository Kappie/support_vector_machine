American protesters denied the right to assemble near the UN building to protest because of the security risk that poses.  They're using the shadow of something that happened a year and a half ago to justify denying you your freedoms.  "Vote freedom first" the republicans said.  As if. Open your eyes, people.  Your personal freedoms are being eroded on an almost daily basis, and the only people talking about it are the  urlLink alternative press , not the pro-corporate media giants like ABC and Fox.   "They that can give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty or safety."   --Benjamin Franklin    "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."   --Abraham Lincoln   Want to get even more pissed off? Go read the comic of the master political cartoonist Tom Tommorrow,  urlLink This Modern World .     Need to calm down? Go check  urlLink this  out.  It's a great semi-collaborative art page.  The titles always kill me.   Bunker Out.
