After a while the giraffe passes out and the man goes to leave but the bartender stops him. 'Hey, you can't leave that lyin' here.' 'What are you talking about, he's a giraffe.'"  Anyways, I went out and purchased a few necessary items for my 3 v. 3 basketball tournament tomorrow and decided to purchase the  Kill Bill Volume 2  soundtrack and several of Johnny Cash's cd's along with my movie purchase.    Last Friday and Saturday I saw three movies:  1. Kill Bill Vol. 2 , 2. The Punisher , and 3. The Alamo .  It breaks down like this:  1.  One of Tarantino's best (aren't they all?) and my second favorite next to  Jackie Brown . 2.  Better than  The Hulk  and  Daredevil , but nowhere near  Spider-Man  or  X-Men 12 . 3.  A decent movie with its moments.  Oh yeah, Jim Bowie got fucked up by those Mexicans.
