He got up really early today (10) and went with his mom out to North Bend for shopping.  Tyke bought so much stuff today it is hilarious.  He is such a girl.  He didn't actually spend any money as his mom bought it all but still he got a lot of clothes.  He got 8 shirts, 3 pairs of shorts, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of shoes, a pair of dress pants, and swim trunks.  All today out at North Bend.  He now has at least 4 pairs of shoes that he will be wearing to school which is another reason that Tyke is such a girl.  But it's ok because he looks good.  And he got a pink shirt finally.  He has been wanting a bright pink short for the longest time and he finally found a cool one.  So he will wear that soon.  Man, it's so great buying a bunch of new clothes and also a bunch of the new clothes being for spring/summer and his trip to Europe.  Tyke got home about 2 after eating lunch with his mom and then he called Macaroon and Dr. Phil about doing the Hamlet questions.  And actually doing them too.  So they got together at Tyke's and of course started off by playing Shithead for 5 games.  Then they played a game of ESPN.  Then Amed got there so they played BS a few times.  Then they decided to actually work.  But they didn't want to so they played ESPN again.  And ordered pizza.  But then they sorta split it up.  Tyke and Macaroon did their part fully while Amed and Dr. Phil played ESPN.  Tyke and Macaroon finished quickly as Tyke went on a roll and just made some good stuff up while Macaroon sat there and said what he thought should go on there.  Tyke just decided to not listen to his ideas and used his own for the most part.  Then they switched roles with Dr. Phil and Amed.  It took them longer to do it but apparently they feel as though theirs is better.  Whatever, it doesn't matter.  And they aren't letting anybody copy the work they did today because they actually worked on it and planned this out so they are just going to bring it to the discussion group tomorrow at Tyke's house when Purdy and Dotti, etc. come back over to talk about it at 11.  It should be fun.  Tyke doesn't know what he's doing after that though, or at night.  Hopefully he gets to hang out with Purdy and/or/hopefully both her and Dotti (did that make sense?).  He cherishes that time.  After the gang finished Hamlet they played more ESPN and ate pizza and then everyone left.  Tyke modeled some of his clothes for his parents (sounds gayer than it was) and chatted with them for a little while before coming back downstairs to chill.  Tyke decided to take the night off and just hang out by himself which is something he is fine with doing.  So here he goes.  Damn it feels good to be a Tyke-ster.
