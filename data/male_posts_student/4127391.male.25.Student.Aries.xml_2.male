Of course, the thought must be merely fleeting because he died over 300 years before Christ was born. But it is startling to read, especially in the Apology, Phaedo, and Crito, that Socrates went willingly to his death, looked forward to the afterlife, and forgave the man who fed him the hemlock. Here are some great quotes from his last days on Earth:  “To fear death, gentleman, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.”  “Gentlemen of the jury, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy.” (Compare this to St. Sir Thomas More's last words)  “I have a convincing witness that I speak the truth: my poverty.”  “It is not difficult to avoid death; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death.”  “A good man cannot be harmed either in life or in death.”  “Now the hour to part has come. I go to die, you go to live. Which of us goes to the better lot is known to no one, except the god.”  I will continue to post evidences of his saintliness as I read them. (All of the above are from the Apology).  I just learned something very interesting too.  There is a rumour that Mel Gibson's next movie might be "The Death of Socrates" or "The Passion of Socrates."  Unfortunately, it would concentrate more on the flaws of the democratic system than on the holiness of Socrates.
