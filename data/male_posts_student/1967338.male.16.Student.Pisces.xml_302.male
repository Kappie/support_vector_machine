I have one other request that I'd like to express. Can we lower the amount of webcomics talk, please? I always feel left out. Of course, I could rip out The West Wing episode reviews. I'm not kidding either. Seriously.  ALSO OUT OF SHEER NECESSITY, I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN FOR REPLIES TO MY GENEROUS JOURNALCON INVITATION. SINCE NONE OF THE RESIDENT FEMALES HAVE RESPONDED AT ALL, THIS IS NOW A SLEEPOVER EVENT!  urlLink RESPOND , DAMMIT!  I ALSO NEED LINK SUGGESTIONS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM!
