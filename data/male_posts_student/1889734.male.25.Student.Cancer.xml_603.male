Now the thugs will know we are afraid of them and their mythical "Arab Street." This will result in more lives lost and wasted time. If we just let the marines do their job and kill our enemies this could be over in a few days. By letting it sit and fester we are making violence more likely.  I thought Bush was supposed to be giving the military free reign to do the job. But now I know he's just another spineless weakling bent on retaining power. he may still acquire my vote, but it won't be for his decision in this crisis.  Anyone care to argue that this is a good idea?
