Anyways what I was going to say is that I have found two best friends through much trials and tribulations.  Through those trials, I have learned how to separate my true feelings from who I am and how I act.  See, I've had affections for my two best friends, Stephanie and Colleen.  Somehow I needed to learn how to keep myself from always expressing how I felt.  Now I've got two great friends that I'm extatic to have back.  Much thanks goes out to my cousin Jeremiah for help, the g-mail account, and everything he's done for me thoughout the years.
