I do like new toys... they are fun. its a tool for work and that makes it all the more interesting.  On the other fronts it is still the clam before the storm and i am sure it will be something silly... very silly that will spark it all out.... We shall see... I am still scared I have to admit.  Mood: lost in translation as I do some work...
