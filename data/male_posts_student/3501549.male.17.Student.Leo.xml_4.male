Bizarre Love Triangle - Frente...  Every time I think of you I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue It’s no problem of mine but it’s a problem I find Living a life that I can’t leave behind There’s no sense in telling me The wisdom of a fool won’t set you free But that’s the way that it goes And it’s what nobody knows And every day my confusion grows Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I’m waiting for that final moment You’ll say the words that I can’t say  I feel fine and I feel good I feel like I never should Whenever I get this way, I just don’t know what to say Why can’t we be ourselves like we were yesterday I’m not sure what this could mean I don’t think you’re what you seem I do admit to myself That if I hurt someone else Then we’d never see just what we’re meant to be Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray I’m waiting for that final moment You’ll say the words that I can’t say
