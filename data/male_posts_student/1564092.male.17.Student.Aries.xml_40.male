New paragraph- I wish I had the courage to just go up and talk to people. That is like my biggest thing at the moment. There have been so many times here lately that I would give anything if God would just put my mind at ease and let me just walk up to someone and talk to them or even worse a group of people and just start talking. I don't know what it is really because I don't have a problem with talking but I feel like such an outsider sometimes and I guess that is my fault because I don't just put myself out there. Now that I have made no since I am going to watch some more tv and just chill because I am so sick of studying for chemistry and history. I feel pretty good about my history final coming up but chemistry on the other hand is another story.
