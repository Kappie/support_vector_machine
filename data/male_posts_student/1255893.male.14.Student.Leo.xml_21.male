As it turned out, my little sis is a thug bear! HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! She's like 8 years old! btw.....I had some really good popeye's food today. I had that mardi gras celebration deal. Which was just like 3 spicy chicken strips w/ fries and a biscuit. I know it doesn't sound like much, but I got really full. I was basically a glutton. I don't care though. I had a good fucking meal and it felt good as I walked home w/ a stomachache. The only bad part about it was the horrible farting afterward. but hey, its a natural thing. So who cares?
