I played tropico almost all day. sat around, doing nothing. it was fun tho. better than school.   i didnt talk to brighton. or aisha, til like 6 30. and i didnt talk on phone. i swear, im going to kill something if i dont talk to her soon. IM is too impersonal.   Christmas. Haven't done anyhting for it yet. I dont want to. Christmas has become so commercialized. Plus, anyone ever think about the north pole legend? these little elf people slaving away all year for one day's respite, then being forced back to the grind? That'd be illegal, if they lived here. Sad. I'll just comine gifts with parents for leila, mom for dad, and dad for mom. then i wont ahve to do anything. It's so sad, I enevr get anyone anything. I'm just like, oh yeah, its from me and Mom. But whatever. I don't care  Us heathen children shouldn't care.  I felt really sick coming out the shower. Wonder if it'll come back?   uhhhhhhhhhhh....that was a grunt. not an uhh like i dont know. uhh again. cept shorrter.  blink 182 song is good. just way too short. American songs are like 3 minutes. i hate it, after listening to short arabic songs that last 5-6 mins.   OOWW crap. i just scratched at a flea bite. except like with the nail, so it really hurt. Yes. ou care why?  I'm such a weirdo. Kim was here watching TV with leila, and so i spend a whle putting gel in my hair for that little time im gonna see her. Loooser.  Aisha wont send me the(a) pic. But theres good reason for that. I mean, I'm playing it off like it's nothing. But we both know it's bigger than just a silly pic.   OK. from now on, i'm going to write exaclty what i want on here. Instead of changing some things when i gave this to brighton. I wanted to get back at her then, she should've seen it. Ok then. Yes. Right.  "Marcus, I need to talk to you about something, but u can't tell it to anyone else. What'd you do, man, get a girl in trouble? *sarcasm*Yes, marcus, and now I ahve to marry her."    "aww thats so cute! dont worry TJ, it's not your fault you haven't developed yet. ...That's what i tell myself'   lol, random quotes from smart guy when i watched for 5 mins earlier. It was a good episode. vI liked that show. the first time I saw it was when i was like 6(?) and it was premiering on disney. So i watched it in san diego, when i was on vacation I could see a marina from my window. I liked the show. I still do, it's a lot better then some of the other pure, unmitigated crap disney shows. Dave the barbarian? The proud family? THATS SO RAVEN????  and yet, lizzie mcguire, one of their best shows, is going away. wtf?  Aisha showed me a quote- It's cute how stupid you are. That's SOO her. I'm totally serious. It's not funny how much that's like how I act to her. I'm so mean to her. I pretended to be andy(some random 7th grader at her school) to see what she'd say about me. all I got was that she told karmen about staying up til 4 on the phone with me. HM? EXPLAIN THAT? ehh but karmens her only old friend now, it seems. So i guess whatever. I don't have anyone like karmen, so that's why I haven't really told anyone.   Only my good friend, bloggie. Lol.   In third grade they made us name our binders. Though we called them trappers, dont know why. I called mine reza, since thats my middle name, which it hink is cool. We were told those trappers were our friends and that now, as 3rd graders, they stored our school lives within them. That was a little out there for us, but i guess it prepared us for now, when, i'd shoot myself if i lost my binders. Oh, I ahve three, each for two subjects. So yeah.  I can't think of anything else to say. So yes. I'll leave you to your thoughts.  Let the blood stream down and stain your lives.  I forgot to write the poem online, AGAIN. I dont feel like writing it all up. oh well. sorry allpoetry.com  yes.   good night, sweet dreams.  ill be up. tallking to aisha on phone. til 11ish, cause I'll be forced to go to church tomorrow.  Much love.  I dont wanna end this. its too comforting writing down all my thoughts.  oh well. Love you...  Peace  ~alex  I think i wanna marry the blog. sorry aisha and brighton. lol
