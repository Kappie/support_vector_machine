It’s got a simple interface, it’s nice, and it’s a fun game to play, too.  If you haven’t played Text Twist before, then you might want to check it out, because it offers a unique experience that has set the standard for word-based web games.    Your job in Text Twist is to use the six letters that they give you, and find as many words as possible that can be spelled out with those letters.  You can’t advance to the next level if you don’t find at least one six letter word, some of which are too obvious, or some of which are so freakin’ difficult that you would have never guessed when it tells you.  But, the game is fun.  And when they finally tell you the words that you missed, you can’t help but laugh, because the words were so easy to figure out.  If you’re having a tough time finding the words, you can always hit the twist button to mix the letters up, and that can help.  Or, an alternative, if you’re at school, have people around to help you out.  It’s a fun game to play with friends.  But, if you don’t have friends, then, it’s still a fun game, but, not as fun.   urlLink    Sometimes the words you think are going to work, just don't work. urlLink     Text Twist is so much fun, but, it’s not as addicting as yesterday’s “Zuma.”  It’s definitely the best word-based game out there though.  It’s got a nice graphical interface, it’s easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun, too.  And that is why I give Text Twist a twisted score of   4 out of 5.
