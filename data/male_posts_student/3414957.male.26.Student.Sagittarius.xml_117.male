It so sad, then he rises to fame, but really in the end that meant nothing becasue he had Adrianne and he made his peace with Mickey.   Math is really intense, if I hear anymore  x to the coefficeint of y cubed over the absolute value of -4 to the 5th power......my head will explode!!!!!!!!  More to come later.
