After waiting for a week or so, my new 3.0GHz Pentium 4 with Hyper-Threading finally arrived... I was the most excited person on earth when I saw the processor package! When WinXP started, XP threws up its scary BSOD onto the screen with an error code of 0x0000007b. I guessed it was just a processor or motherboard driver mismatch and so used XP's Repair feature to fix the problem. And I was really relieved when I saw that it booted perfectly...  School is going to start soon and I hope I can continue blogging...  My Normal School Day TimeTable is as follows...  6:00 AM | Get up  start putting on uniform, having breakfast and so on  7:30 AM | Leave from home for school    ------- At School ------- 5:00 PM | Back from school, Freshen up, Have food etc. 5:30 PM | At my Grandparents' House 6:30 PM | Start studies and School Homework if any or else start 12:00 PM routine 8:30 PM | Dinner 9:00 PM | Continue School HW if any or else start 12:00 PM routine 12:00 AM | Blog, Check  Send Mail 12:30 AM | Research and Learning in Computers, Embedded Systems, Electronics, .NET etc. 1:30 AM (Variable Time) | Sleep  (Inbetween this schedule I will spare sometime for making calls to contacts like my computer science professor, Mr. Santhosh and keep in touch)
