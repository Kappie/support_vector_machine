Then the irony I see, in these little children, finding the little of joys in the rain.  We often take things for granted, belittling the little wonders that the world has given us. We overshadow our real feelings, in this faltering reality that we have created.  We see ourselves in these little children; Adimiring how it feels to be liberated, how it is to be so full of innocence. To have the world go by you, slowly.  We abide not by our expectations of life, but by that of others. Forsaking our happiness, for recognition, for acceptance.  We've come a long way, seeking maturity, living in the world. But we let ourselves go by, without taking in what is around us.  The suns glow, the grasses' scent, the warmth of sand, and the beatitude of the rain. We let it all go by us.  At times we turn around, seeking for what we once had. Only this time, it's different. It's completely changed.  So just stop, for we have to ask ourselves; Is all that really worth it? After all, a man can't profit by gaining the world, if he should lose his soul.
