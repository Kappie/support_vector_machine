The summber will own serious burgers.  Let me tell you.  This weekend has been fun so far.  Friday was a half day.  After school I lifted and then after a while I went over to Whit's and watched The Goonies because I hadn't seen it and Whit wanted me to watch it.  And we watched The Matrix because she hadn't seen it and it was tight.  Today I spend most of the day trying to install an old stereo system into my Mazda.  It looks pretty cool so far, I think.  The only main problem is that it skips and stuff.  I think we're going to have to get a new deck for it.  The amps are pretty tight and stuff.  Everything works.  We need to install some high freq. speakers in the front tomorrow.  Should be fun.  I'll be bumpin' in no time.  So tonight Whit came over and we watched Hackers.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on one of the most nerdy computer movies ever made.  It's almost up there with Revenge of the Nerds... seriously.  So I'm about to fall asleep here, so I should be getting to bed.  Night.
