There were rumors around that indicated that Hillary was a contender for VP.  But she had a vagina, so she was out.  If she had a penis, we might have had Kerry/Clinton.  I have the opinion that everyone that a person likes in politics employs the same methods and has many of the same flaws as a person that they hate.  So for all of the deomcrats that hate Bush, and I hate him too, but for all those dems, the people that they preach about and think have a new voice and direction for America, they suck too.  I personally believe, and this is backed up through conversations with many people involved in politics, I believe that if you aren't a bigwig but still back a candidate, you are doing it for one or more of the following 3 reasons.  Reason number 1; you're looking for power.  If you want to enter the system and have enough intelligence/determination/lack of human companionship, then you'll back someone and be a good lapdog.  If that person is victorious, you're home free.  Second reason, you are a person that can never succeed like they can, and want to be a part of their comet.  Most people that I have met involved with political campaigns could never be what they will always hope to be, which is someone in a dominant position.  Sure, they can dominate any subordinates they are lucky enough to watch over, but that's it.  Charismatic and strong people run for office and those who can never do the same support them.  Last reason, these people truly believe that the person they are backing is a good man/woman (but who are we kidding), and that their support will  make the world a better place.  Only problem is that the world will never become a better place when the only way to jump into the ultimate power seat is to make everyone like you through mistruths and manipulation.  God Bless America.
