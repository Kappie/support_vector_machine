It won't last long though, since I'll be heading out of town this next week.  Here's what you can look for next week:  -Audio Blog: I'm gonna try and audioblog it at least once or twice a day while I'm gone.  This may include "hidden cellphone," in which anything my yearbook buddies say or do may be recorded and posted live to the blog.  -Pictoblog: Coming this week is the "Blog of Bagel Photo Blog," in which I'm going to be posting pictures of all sorts of stuff.  I'm going to have my camera around whilst I'm gone, and I'll come back and post a bunch of pictures.  Then, they'll also go to the Photo Blog for archiving.  I'm getting to work on that soon.  And that's what you can look for.  While I'm in NY, I've made the decision that both blogs will be CLOSED.  No updates, no photo blogs, no audio blogs, nothing... I'm just going to take that vacation as a break.  That way, when I come back, I'll be feeling the heavy addiction to Blogger all over again!  And in other news, some may remember the Dell Axim that I squirted Windex all over accidentally.  Well, I'm finally going to get that fixed, so I'll be able to update more frequently, even from school if I need to.  (Simple: load the create new post screen on your PDA before you leave, maybe a few different windows if you're a bloggermaniac, update it throughout the day, then hook up to a computer, and send it away...instant blogification).  Hopefully I'll have it back before school starts.  We'll see though.  It's a mystery as of this point.  I'm not going to send it until after I get back from the New York state, so I won't have it for school starting, but, sometime shortly after.    Well, anyway...I'd better get started on today's 2 Digital Lust updates...I'll explain what's going on there in my first post for today.  I also want to try and get a new poll up here within the next day or so.  That's it for now.  Until later today (lyrics), do something constructive and time consuming.  You won't regret it.
