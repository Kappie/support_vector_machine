Now, I see that Yahoo! said that since the theatre wasn't with Fandango but with another "virtual box office," MovieTickets.com.  This got me so mad cuz I could've saved like $17.50 if I bought tickets from MovieTickets!  Oh yeah, I bought tickets to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Later.   urlLink MovieTickets.com Jamaica Multiplex Cinemas. Movies, showtimes and tickets.
