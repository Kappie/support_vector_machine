Today is the first day of Spring break, so that’s a big plus.  Now I have some extra time to write up a few game reviews and enjoy the warm weather that we’ve been having here in the Pacific NW.  Saturday Rebecca and I took off for the beach (more specifically, to Lincoln City, Oregon) and that was relaxing.  We took my Chow/Lab mix, Emmy, and had some good fun seeing her experience the ocean for the first time.  I want to go back during the summer and do some surfing, though there was a fairly famous shark attack there a few years ago (the guy's board, shark bite and all, is on display at the local surf shop).  Oh well, you only live once right?  Today is Rebecca’s 24th birthday, so after work I’m going to head over to her place for B-Day dinner.  I’ve already bought her the present she wanted – the latest in the Nancy Drew PC game series.  She really loves those things.  It’s funny how she proclaims them the best games on the planet and turns around and talks about how boring Halo is.  The good news is she has no interest in writing game reviews…  Tomorrow I’m going to head over to my friend’s house to check out his recent purchases of Steel Battalion and a massive HDTV.  That should kick ass.  Hopefully, we’ll get some Mario Kart LAN in as well (it goes without saying that we’ll play some Halo).    In terms of gaming, I’m currently almost finished with Breakdown for the Xbox, and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes for the Cube.  After that I have Resident Evil 0, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Rebel Strike, Metroid Prime, Beyond Good  Evil, Dynasty Warriors 4, Super Monkey Ball and StarFox Adventures to tackle.  Here’s to hoping I don’t end up with carpel tunnel syndrome over Spring break.    On a side note: the Blazers are going to make the playoffs!  Oh yeeeeaaaah!
