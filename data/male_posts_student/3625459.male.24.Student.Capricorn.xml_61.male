Her heart belongs to some one else. I cant stand her trying to not say things i want to tell her. im there for her , i'll be down below to catch her if she falls , i hope she doesnt and that shes always happy . Sometimes thats all that matters, her happiness.   I miss her, but isnt it wrong to like someone whos already taken ?
