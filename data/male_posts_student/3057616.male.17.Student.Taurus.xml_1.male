One of my ports must be closed.. but I'm not sure which one...  I went to PS alone to play arcade while waiting for YoYo and Jasper they all... Ended up I met Yen Yen and CK first.... I think today I must have been a bit wierd with my Para.... I was kinda unstable... lolz...  I suddenly found that Evo, Yoyo were suddenly rather cold towards me... I wonder why... divine intervention?... maybe... Haiz... Victor went to MS with his frenz....   Nothing else much happened today.... other then the fact that I DID give Nicholas his own account....  Mood: Lonely, Depressed... Questioning....
