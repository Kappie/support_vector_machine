Me ia m good .. well right now Tia and Christian left .. and I feel soo much better now .. like earlier I felt like some fucking shit blob on the floor and tia said if i wanted her and christian to come over I said yes and yeah I went outside to go use my flag and stuff while they came and i didnt even know they came .. it was like oh its you? .. and yeah .. I saw christian first .. I was soo happy at that point .. he cheered me up right away .. and then i saw tia and I was completely happy now .. Then . we went into my house and yeah we started talking I started feeling better I hugged tia .. then I hugged christian .. he smells soo good .. and his hugs made me wanna cry because I felt soo happy in his arms .. but I tried not to and I started feeling better .. I hugged him and my cheeck was wet I dunno if he was crying .. I hope not. Well I love him .. and das dat. I gave him a kiss and automatically I felt soo much better because his kisses can cure my every scar in my body .. and tias hugs can ease the pain from those scars, while my other friends can help prevent from further scars happening. My friends are all I need in life .. if my family stops loving me then they stop loving me and are no longer my family because .. my true family I love is my friends and boyfriend .. they are the cornerstone of my will to want to life .. with out them .. I would not exist .. without christians kisses, hugs, love, carring, etc .. I dont know where i would be right now so .. thank you babe!!! .. MUAH I LOVE YOU, MY BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF HEAVEN. So yeah .. hehe i gotta get going .. I LOVE YOU CHRISTIAN AND TIA .. I LOVE YOU ..
