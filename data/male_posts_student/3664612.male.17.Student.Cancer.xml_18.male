The Greeks scored on the 56th minute, and Portugal had their chances to even up the scores, but i guess it wasnt met to be for the Portugal. After the game, i went back to sleep and woke up at around 11 am. Had breakfast and played a bit of Far Cry.  Now Far Cry is the best PC game i've ever played. I just love the graphics, its so smooth. Well at around noon i played a bit of PS2 and i continued my career in FIFA 2004 with Birmingham FC. At around 3 my friend called me saying theres this under-age club tonight, i was about to go but i hate clubs so i didnt. Some of the girls i know wanted me to come but because i didnt some are pretty pissed at me o.O Instead i went to see the 10 year olds Indonesia Football club play in the Kanga Cup. Too bad they lost 4-2. But hey i thought i played pretty good. Tomorrow im watching them play again, maybe because i felt sorry for them, since they're the only Indonesian team in the whole tournament. But for some of the people i know they come for the chance to get publicity, which pisses me off. Ill talk about that later on.  Now today the weather was so fucking cold, my feet nearly turned blue. God i hate cold weather! Crowley mentioned that the weather in Indonesia is nice right now. What i wouldnt do just to go to the nice and humid weather in Indonesia. *sigh*
