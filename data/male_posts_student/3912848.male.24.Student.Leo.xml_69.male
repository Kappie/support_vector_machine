The camera pans to the medicine cabinent, where the mother chooses a medicine capsule, and continues to murmur comforting words to the child.  The commercial concludes with something about 1 in 5 families in America must choose between medicine or food.  The shower confused me the first few times I saw the commercial, but presumably the child has asthma.  I am wondering about the 1 in 5 statement though: how did they come up with this number?  I don't remember who pays for the commercial, or I'd look them up, but I checked around on Google rather extensively, and---for a problem so large---there is precious little real information.  Nearly every website I visited was an  assertion  by someone, usually a politician sponsoring a bill, a aid worker, or an opinion writer, that some people, especially the elderly, must choose between medicine and food.  The only actual evidence I could find  urlLink was a study  done in a Minneapolis hospital in 2001 or before, which concluded that 18% of 527 patients (53 people) had not had enough food to eat at least once in the previous year.  Now, it may be true that thousands upon thousands of Americans must choose between medicine and food, as one source I read claimed, but I haven't seen any  evidence  of that.  I'd like to know the truth, one way or the other: too many of those "1 in 5" claims are based on estimations or plain old spurious data.
