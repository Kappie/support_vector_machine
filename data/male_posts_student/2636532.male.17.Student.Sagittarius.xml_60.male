WHAM!! i'm slammed with an entire school that needs to be all cleaned up. i swear that once i'm done, i'll scream if i have to scrub another desk, actually i'm quitting soon so i'll never have to again. but then i've gotta find another job, and i've already ruled wal-mart cuz it's full of wack jobs and jerk offs. but that's soething to worry out later. you know, i never thought a mouse could scare me, it being only a fraction of my size. but it jumped out of a container of dog food in an explosion of kibbles and i almost pissed myself, cuz usually dog food doesn't explode. my next blog will be contributed to pranks that make summer ever so much more bareable, but i won't do it now just cuz i gots no time. -Matt
