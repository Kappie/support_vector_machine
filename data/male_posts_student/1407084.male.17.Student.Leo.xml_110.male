However, you would be surprised at how nice the people are. They brought cookies. Yum..   I really want to go to bed right now. But, for some reason, I have been coersed to stay up and write. Hmm. I'd have a hard time sleeping anyways.  I took a walk around the world  To ease my troubled mind I left my body laying somewhere In the sands of time I watched the world float  To the dark side of the moon I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah I watched the world float  To the dark side of the moon After all I knew it had to be  Something to do with you I really don’t mind what happens now and then As long as you’ll be my friend at the end  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I love country music. There is a song for everything. :)  BTW, the above song is "Kryptonite" by 3 Doors Down. It is not country. Have you ever just listened to the lyrics of a George Strait Album? So many songs of his carry truths of life. I guess I am a secret fanatic of George Strait music.   Maybe I'm missing my calling.. maybe I should become a radio DJ when I am older.. haha  Suppose something you remember as being extraordinary and wonderful goes away for a while and appears back as something totally different from what you remember, yet exactly the same.. Maybe you know the feeling.. it's strange. I am talking gibberish, so I am going to hit the sack(I wonder where that originated..) See you all tomorrow.. err.. wow, almost today, I had better get going
