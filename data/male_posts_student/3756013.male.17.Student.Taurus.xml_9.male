There was one guy in there who had 3 tickets and no money to pay for any of them lol. Then later that night things went kind of crazy and now things have gotten better...I've realized who my true friends are...and I'm finally happy again!!! WOO!   Monday Stephanie said she and I can get together and read that stupid book for English...So maybe soon ill be getting that book done. Hil and I been talking lately...She finally got her laundry done so maybe she can go out now...lol and Juan and I have been hanging out a lot again..That's great! Oh...and finally I got rid of my piece of shit cell phone and got a new camera phone...love it...Its a Motorola v400...Lets see...That's it! Things are going good and I'm starting to enjoy summer...Well, that's it for now. Talk later!
