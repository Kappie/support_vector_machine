Basically I have to build 10 pages on the computer of pictures of people at the church, kinda like a year book at schools.  I've been taking lots of pictures and trying to figure out this program I'm building it on.  It's a lot of fun.  Then when I was in the church office trying to figure out some things for the directory, I was asked to help run the new video camera for the church.  I'll just say it's not a home video camera, this is a serious camera.  When I figure out what model it is I'll post it under the Technology section of the forum.  Well then one of the pastors daughters wants me to video her wedding with it.  And set up her lights.  A few days later the head of sound for the church asked me to come train in the sound room.  I can believe it.  The verse that says, "...He is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope."  That verse has been proven in just a few days and I wouldn't be surprised if there's more to come.  Of course I did pray that God wouldn't give me more than I can handle.  I want to do my best for Him and not be distracted with too many things.  I just want to encourage you that if you've been waiting for God to show you what to do... just wait.  'Cause when it rains, it pours.
