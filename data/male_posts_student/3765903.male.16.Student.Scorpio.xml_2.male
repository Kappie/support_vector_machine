If only I had severe rheumatism (Don't know what that is, but it sounds cool) and arthritus in all my joints, my knee's squeeked even more than Q-Ball's front gate (Classiest Episode of Sliders EVER!) and I had a walking stick which conviently concealed my whiskey botle, I really would be a retired old man! I get up at inconsitent times in the morning, sit with my cereal complaining at the quality of the BBC nowadays and that how, back in my day, it used to have proper presenters - Ed The Duck being a prime example here - and that all the programmes are the same and how the "young don't know how good they have it these days"!. After an hour or two of that I wonder upstairs for my shower, complain bitterly about how cold it is and increase the thermostat/gas bill to rediculously high figures and then, for the finale, complain that nobody has gone and gotten me my morning paper yet. Yep. That's the first portion of my daily 'routine' nowadays... my gawd it's boring!! Can't wait until we start college and my Maths lecturer starts throwing those damned "unity" and "intersection" thingies at me, then, finally, my brain will melt away into sloppy custard (or cream, steph :P... lol, sorry) and the mental asylum will admit me - finally, escaped from the clutches of the Queen Bitch and provided with good quality padded walls!!! Lol. Anyway, this is a general post for today... I'm going to go hunting through the Internet now for some classy site to Blog (love that word) after I've sneezed and found myself a t-shirt. Have Fun, Martin J.  PS: The image below is kind of copyrighted to another site... erm, and I do admit to using paint to remove the (c) sign from the centre of the cartoon. Sorry to the artists, but I'll leave your site address as acknowledgment (attempt to avoid being sued):  urlLink Old Man Cartoon . Enjoy!  urlLink     urlLink
