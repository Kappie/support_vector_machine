I turned 18 on the 25th and everyweekend since i've been out and every weeknight i've been trying to do school work after normal work. But I have learned a very valuable lesson, don't run on a gravel driveway while drunk, especially when someone else who's more drunk is running behind you and can't go straight. tsk, I wish I had time to write more but I'm so sleepy and it's only 5 o'clock. -Matt
