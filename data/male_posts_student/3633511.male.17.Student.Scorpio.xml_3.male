My main interest is cricket, although I realise that I will never become a great player; I get so much enjoyement out of the game that it doesn't matter. Other things I am likely to 'Blog' about are World Situations etc....   Well, that's it for my first blog, but keep checking it out, over time the pages will fill up.
