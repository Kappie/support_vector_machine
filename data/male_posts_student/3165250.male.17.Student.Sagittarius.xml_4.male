Clip one shoe in, take a stroke, and while coasting, do the other.  2. Be in an easy gear when you start off. you need that quick coasting ability to get that other foot in.  3. When possible, avoid trying to pedal uphill and clip your other foot in.  4. Most importantly, if ever you are asked to put a tap show on while wearing the cleated shoes, those cleats have another use... denting shins!
