In other news I fplayed bzflag for ages after getting back from doing some horribly confusing lit discussion with my lit teacher (its coz I got 4 out of 25...). Also I'm glad to see the  urlLink linux on ipod  progressing nicely, the devs should have it bettering the apple firmware in around 3 months. I might become the doc-writer for the project.
