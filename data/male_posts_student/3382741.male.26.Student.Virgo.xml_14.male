They misrepresented what I said and wouldn't listen when I tried to correct them.  They were determined to burn me at the stake of my mistakes from the past.  They brought up 6 year old charges that I had long since repented of.  They refused to make the issue be the actual differneces in doctrine but prefered to say things like "he doesn't want to change" (referring to me not wanting to change the fact that I am gay).  There were about 3 members there who at least somewhat supported me -- they at least listened to what I was saying and made the only issue be that I disagree with the church concerning the complete accuracy of the Bible as it is today.  Anyway, I don't really feel like belaboring it all.  The actually motion that was made said something like I would have to say that I believe the Bible is acurate and capable to speak to the gay issue.  This was made by one of the people who believe me and it actually managed to satisfy everyone (even me).  I of course would not agree to say that since I don't believe it and so I was put out of the church.  So altho it was not technically for being gay, to most of the people there that was the issue.  Sad really.  Now I don't really hold any bad feelings for anyone there.  I belive that did what they think is right and they did it becuase they love me.  I have no doubt of that.  However they did some things that do upset me.  I know VERY well what they believe and teach; I have grown up with it litterally all my life.  I know that they teach it is wrong to talk about a discipline case with anyone from the church except those who are going with you to be a witness.  Dispite their belief in this they told my ENTIRE family before we got there.  Not even an hour after the meeting I had monday night with Mr. Hawkins and Grandfather my Mom called me to talk about it.  She had be told even before the meeting that it was going to happen and most of the details.  She then proceeded to tell my brothers and sister.  They also told my uncle (I got an email from him tues about it).  It anoys me that they don't follow their own rules yet put me out for simply not believeing the same things they do (not even an action).  Is that not hippocritical?  I also am anoyed that they twisted what I said and claimed that I said what I did not. .... oh well ... it's not my problem anymore.  as for me I am doing ok.  I hate crying and almost never do ... but seeing my Mom cry last night after the meeting sure got me going.  I am sorry things had to happen this way.  I am sorry that I "dissapoited" everyone.  But it is really thier own fault for being so close minded and unable to see even the possibility that they could be wrong.
