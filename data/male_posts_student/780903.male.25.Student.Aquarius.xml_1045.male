It got me thinking... what if Dr. Seuss was writing ads today?  With no disrespect meant toward his great legacy (I'm just trying to have some fun here):   Hop on Pop  (sponsored by the Association of Plastic Surgeons)  You used to always Hop on Pop Afraid, dismayed, that he may drop His arms would shake, his belly flop You bounced when you would hop on pop  But now there is a surgery That lets pop's belly fin'lly be As small as that of you or me But this procedure is not free  But you will think it heaven-sent When pop can touch his toes when bent He'll fit inside a camping tent The death rate's only five percent  Other titles in the series:  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish  (sponsored by Red Lobster)  How The Grinch Stole Hyundais  (sponsored by The Club)  The "Cat" In The "Hat"  (sponsored by Viagra)  There's a Wocket in my Pocket (come and touch it)  (sponsored by Michael Jackson)
