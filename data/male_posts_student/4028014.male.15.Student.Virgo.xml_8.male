Well on the 11th, actually my blog should be posted up... But due to the internet prob, i was unable to post my blog up... I wrote alot of things and was so fed up when i realisedd i can't post it up!!! Urgh... Well in the mean time of writing of my blog on that day, i was feeling mad... My mother just came back and suddenly beat me up... She complained that i've been using the computer every day and so forth... What ever... I'm so mad with her... So this is where the cold war started...  Well... Then on the 12th... Urgh... Bad day, bad day... Got back my Mother Tongue O Level results... Got a C6... Bad man... I'm very very disappointed with my results... My cousin got an A1 for that... Urgh... Upon hearing my results, my mum insulted me so badly... Urgh... I don't care... This war going to go on for weeks...  Now... Today's blog... Hmm... Saw my class photo... Well, badly taken... My formal photo look like a lutanic while my informal look like a vampire... Urgh... Sad man... Last year already... But my photo is so badly taken... Then after school, my friend and i went to take photo again... Well, again, i turn out to be vampire again... Haiz... Sad man... Destroy the whole picture...   Well, nothing much to comment already... Take care! Tata... See you in my next update!
