So I got up, put my contacts in, and did what I pretty much always do when I'm bored. I took awalk at 5 in the morning.      It's been so cool in the morning. When I went out side it smelled like fall.I saw one tree already with turned leaves. This made me very afraid. ThenI reasoned that it was WAY too early for me to be thinking about school, and kept on going. now that I think about it, I want school to start, and yet I don't. But I'm sure you've all been there before...      I actually just got back from said walk. It's a little cool out for late July, but it's relatively tolerable. It was nice walking down 27 because everyone was so friendly, especially when you consider the ungodly hour that we were all out. The road was pretty much deserted with the exception of the occasionaljerk going 60 ( MAN I hate that!) I ended up walking all over town. It was nice to just be able to walk down the quiet street, not worrying about unfortunate tourists asking for directions, traffic, etc. It just gave me time to think, as cliche as that sounds.      In other news, my mom and I decided that in a week or two when my dad takes my brothers to Boy Scout Camp *shudder* we are going to go to New York. We're most likely going to take a train down there, and stay for a week or so. I'm very  very    very   happy about this. *Does little jig around the room* OH! which reminds me- I think I'm going to go with the vintage black and white, somewhat vogue-ish New York theme in my room. I can't wait!      Now I shall leave you all, as my mom just asked if I'd keep her company while she goes on her walk around town and such. Talk to you all later! *hugs!*
