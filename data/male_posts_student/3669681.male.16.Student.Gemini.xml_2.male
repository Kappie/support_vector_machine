Here is how.  As soon as Google sends me some invites I will give some away right here on this blog.  Yes YOU could win a FREE Gmail account.  If you have any suggestions on how I should give the invites away please leave a comment.  I look foward to making one or more of you very very happy.  Be sure to keep checking the blog and looking for Gmail invites!  -MacMan
