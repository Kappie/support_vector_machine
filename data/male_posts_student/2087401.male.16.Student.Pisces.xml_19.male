Since I was big and black now they had me playing a Klingon.  Much other stuff happened that I don't remember. In another dream, or possibly the same one, Cristian walked in on Ashley and I having sex.  He left the door open and everyone walked in, loads of people.  It was akward for a moment, but then everyone started partying and ignoring us.  It was like we weren't even there.  Or else they weren't.  It was odd anyway.
