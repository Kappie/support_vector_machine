This is the part that I thought was the funniest (emphasis added):    What can't you do?  I'm not a Justin Timberlake. I'm not a dancer. I'm not a really hip-hop-type person.   I don't want to sing about things that I feel are inappropriate. I'm not going to sing about sex and drugs because I don't feel that's what my responsability is.   (as published in the July 26th issue of  urlLink  People  )  Has he not read the lyrics to his hit "Invisible"?  Here's a refresher:  What are you doing tonight / I wish I could be a fly on your wall / Are you really alone / Still in your dreams / Why can't I bring you into my life / What would it take to make you see that I'm alive  [Chorus ]  If I was invisible/ Then I could just watch you in your room / If I was invisible / I'd make you mine tonight / If hearts were unbreakable / Then I can just tell you where I stand / I would be the smartest man / If I was invisible / (Wait..I already am)  I saw your face in the crowd / I called out your name / You don't hear a sound / I keep tracing your steps / Each move that you make / Wish I could be what goes through your mind / Wish you could touch me with the colors of your life  [Repeat Chorus ]   So, it's all right to sing about stalking?  That's  not inappropriate? Looks like Mr. Aiken definitely follows a different set of morals. Creepy...
