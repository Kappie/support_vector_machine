In order to pass my Finals, I have to get good grades on everything (including Algebra...ewww), and they're forcing me to type up some long report AND 24 creative writing assignments! Jebus, why can't it be easier to pass? ;_;  I started feeling better when I got home though. Today was my girlfriend Nicolai's birthday, but unfortunately I did not have the time or money to send her something. However, proclamations of love and romance, and a beautiful poem was able to suffice. ^_^
