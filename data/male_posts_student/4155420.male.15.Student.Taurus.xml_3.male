Losing the one I called best friends   Having great time in my life .... Having Sad time in my life   Doing things I'm proud .... Doing things I've regret   Scoring A in all subjects ... Never got an A in any subjects   Spending precious time wit my father .... Spending sad time in front of his grave   ALL OF THIS HAS THOUGHT ME A LESSON IN LIFE ~   but unti this moment... I have never learn ...      ~What to do when I'm LoneLy~      So...save me from this loneliness ( hope I "spelt" it right ) ... heh ...
