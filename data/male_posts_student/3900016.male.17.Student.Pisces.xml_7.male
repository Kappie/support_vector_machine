Well, first, you need to click on the little comments link at the bottom of each post, usually says " 634 Comments " or something like that. Then after that you will after scroll to the bottom of all those comments and you will see a faint link that says " Post a Comment ", click it! Ok so far so good. Now This might be tricky...You'll see a screen that look like it wants you to login, this is where you start freaking out and afraid that you won't be able to post a small comment. Well...today is your lucky day, cuz if you look below that sign in part there is a small link that says " or Post Anonymously ". Click it! You did it...but then you ask, "What if I don't want to post anonymously?" Well...what you can do is write out your comment and then at the end put your name. After your done writing that comment you can go ahead and click " Publish Your Comment ". So how did you do? Post a comment for this post if you were able to do it!
