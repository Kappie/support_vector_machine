They want me because I'm the only one who can take a decent picture-- their last roll of film didn't turn out. They suspected supernatural foul play... I suspect bad photography. Heish said that Easter had blood dripping from his forehead and behind his ears when he got back into the car... He also said he was wearing a hat... oogabooga... I still call bullshit. If I don't update by tomorrow morning some pissed off goth probably shot me... [UPDATE] DERP! Yeah... So... Looks like I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that li'l escapade
