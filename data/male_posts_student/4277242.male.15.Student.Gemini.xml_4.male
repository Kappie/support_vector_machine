Named Saschen-Gaelic, this language is churned out in a cheap way that is replacing English words with those who sound exactly the same but spelt according to the Irish spelling system (mostly). Similar languages are Brithenig (P-celtic-romance) and Breathnach (Q-celtic-romance) mixing welsh or irish with latin stuff. Its practical use is in the heraldric mottos of Thomond studios ("Pár-Árt Pár-Úíosðaim Pár-Paisge")      That was the title.      What really happened in the Holocene epoch are two really interesting table tennis events on at the Olympics today. Both are women's events, and both have one side of the table that the family is interested in. The first one is China against South Korea. Whoa. Darned coool. Dad counted thirty passes in one point. Zhang Yining and Kim Kyung Ah are making each other's lives hell. The ball parted the air in long shallow arcs as bats swung with bloodlust.      The one featuring our other supportee, Li Jiawei and the other Kim, was more "violent" (cited from mum) but I think thas was because Kim was shouting all the time. To me they were like, meticulously pushing the ball around, and this gives an atmosphere that to me seems similar to Judo. You didn't try to distract the opposition and kick him in his stomach. You just tried to push the responsibilities to the other and wait for the opposition to send the ball strolling into the net. And OMG the scores are so close! Whoa whoa whoa... Singapore lost by a little margin. Really little. Three or four points. It's like Simon getting into Grand Finals and me just getting the A* in my Project.      --STOP PRESS--   Li beat Kim 11-0 in the second game. So I'm told. Lololololol my flank is in imminent danger of exploding.
