Or at least found the studying they did to be more distasteful.  It's kind of disarming to ask a friendly question about how someone's break went and get such a strong answer.  Like if you ask someone how he's feeling and he tells you something really personal about his sinuses or his gastrointestinal system.  ME: Hey.  How's it going? OTHER PERSON: Constipated. ME: Oh.
