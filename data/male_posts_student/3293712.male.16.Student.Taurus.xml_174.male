It was funny to see all the curse words changed to 'clown,' but it just wasn't as entertaining as watching the non-TV version. So, here I am.  Tomorrow, I'll probably head up to the Oselands. Chris just got off work a little while ago, and I am suprised that he didn't call.   Last night I stayed at Bryce's. We played some Halo, sat around, and I went to bed early (2:30 am) because I had to get up early to work that morning. I was woken up around noon by Gravity Beam dropping his toy crayon on my face, wanting me to throw it, and that damn ferret crawling all over me like I was some kind of jungle gym for her personal amusement. Well, I'm not, especially when I am sleeping. When I left, Dale was sleeping in an armchair in the same position as when I arrived, 17 hours earlier.  Top news today: Rick James, famous Super Freak and freebaser, has bought the farm. Now, I hope the horrible Chappelle's Show imitators will stop with their jokes for good. I don't know if they think parroting things that happened a year ago on the show over and over and over is  funny , or if they just hate everyone.   Some guy is claiming that Ireland is the Lost City of Atlantis. Personally, I believe that that Atlantis was a MacGuffin (is it proper to use that term when referring to writings, also?) to move two of Plato's dialogues forward (I can't remember which, but I am not exactly a scholar).  I bought some new CDs yesterday. One was Bad Religion's  Suffer , one of the five most influential albums on modern punk rock. Of course, it is no  No Control , although everybody probably disagrees with me on that. I needed to replace my old copy, which I lost approximately six months ago. The other, the Dead Kennedy's  Bedtime for Democracy , was an impulse buy. I had been trying to trade for Chris's vinyl version for a few weeks, and decided that "Take This Job and Shove It" was a perfect fit for a post-work Thursday. Not that I don't marginally enjoy my job, but I oppose work on general principle.  I slept on my belt last night. It has some metal that I am allergic to, and now I have this weird rash all over my stomach that itches. It sucks.   Since I moved into the future with my iPod, I think that it is time for a new mix CD. By mix CD I mean iPod playlist. I'll have to get working on that and post it in a few days. Unlike John, who foolishly slaps his favorite songs from each band together, my playlists are a work of art. Each is carefully crafted with different sounds and genres to elict a wide array of emotions. A playlist is like a puzzle, and I enjoy fitting the pieces of reggae and hardcore together.  Well, I am going to take a shower. I hope you enjoy the minor changes.  Gute nacht.
