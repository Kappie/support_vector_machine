Don’t worry, I’ll notify the press.  First, I would like to turn to their self-titled album, popularly known as the   urlLink White Album  .  This two disc (originally vinyl, now available on CD) album was composed in 1968 as a follow up to their creative and sophisticated work, Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Sgt. Pepper featured an extravagantly colored cover with equally elaborate musical pieces.  At the time, most critics believed the Beatles could not outdo this major production.  The genius of the White Album is that the Beatles made it a simple album comprised mostly of simple acoustic guitar tracks.  Rather than trying to surpass the grandeur of Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles displayed beauty through simple, basic songs.   Martha My Dear  is one of my favorite songs on the album.  The song is primarily carried by the piano and catchy, melodic vocals.  George Harrison sports one of his best compositions,  While My Guitar Gently Weeps , which shows his maturing abilities as a songwriter that would be more evident later in the Beatles and in his solo career.  Songs like  The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill ,  Piggies ,  Rocky Raccoon , and  Cry Baby Cry  have a narrative feel like country music.  These songs add an eclectic mix to the album, which leave first time listeners delightfully surprised at what could come next.  Paul McCartney contributes playful works like  Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da  and  Wild Honey Pie , which easily elicit smiles from Beatles’ patrons.  Paul’s well-known  Blackbird  appears on this album as well, which is a staple for all acoustic guitar players.  Ballads like  I Will  and  Julia  are perfect for those romantics in need of a fresh and simple exposition of love.  The album rocks out with  Everybody’s Got Something to Hide Except Me  My Monkey ,  Helter Skelter , and  Back in the U.S.S.R. .  In short, the White Album has something for everybody.  In one album, the Beatles capture in beautiful simplicity a broad range of genres.  Not only did the Beatles manage to produce successfully a good album after the wide success of Sgt. Pepper, but they truly made a fresh, innovative contribution to popular music itself.
