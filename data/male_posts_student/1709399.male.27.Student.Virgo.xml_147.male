I was lucky to spot two playful Leopard cubs having a whale of a time playing with each other and got a few good snaps of their merriment.  Also since it was Winter we saw ample water Birds like Cormorants,egrets,herons,storks   pelicans.                                      The attitude of people was shocking . Couple of guys standing next to me were throwing stones at a Lion and people were also seen teasing the monkeys  the Tiger. I had to shout on a Group to stop throwing stones  I really felt sorry for those wonderful animals to be amidst such cruel Humans .
