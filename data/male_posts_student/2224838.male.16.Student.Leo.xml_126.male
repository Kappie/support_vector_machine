First, I woke up late yesterday for some inexplicable reason, and I wasn't showered and dressed until after noon. Once I was dressed, I really didn't have much of a chance to make a post because Blogger was upgrading for a few hours. In the evening, I was actually over at my mom's house giving her presents and lots of love.   So, please don't be like my brother and say "if you really love mom then you would find a way to wish her a happy Mother's Day on your blog," because I did.  Just to clear things up: HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY. I love you mom.
