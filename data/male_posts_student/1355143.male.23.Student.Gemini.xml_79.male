We checked out a fairly big club called Joy, with an amazing dancer on stage, we dribbled all night long, pretty pricy gawping session though as drinkies came in at over â‚¬10, :o(  From Madrid I am goin back to London for Semana Santa and then back to Barca for Steffen's last week, gonna be emotional, I will be the last one left standing!  Trying to work out which sights and sounds to experience in the last 5 days so should be pretty hardcore.  Apart from that I have managed to secure me a job at UBS for the summer which is ace, it looks like Constance has got a job lined up with Merrill Lynch, Bee Bee is working at an Italian bank and Steffen has an interview with JP Morgan, if Tim joins the team (and working as a cashier does not count Tim  Ulli) then I think we will be a fully fledged bunch of capitalist bastards.  All about the money really!  Hopefully when my camera gets fixed and Steffen's Konami digital camera prints a few photos out then we will put some evidence of our travails on Walky's website.  As a note it appears that most people have been sent instructions as how to blog but either cant be bloggered (you know you love it!) or just cant comprehend how, I tink da process needs to be simplified!  Hasta entonces tios y tias, I also had a really cool birthday, massive party etc...... but am running out of time on this machine so you will have to stay on the edge of your seats and wait for me to tell you about it another time!  Hasta la pasta,  Adam ( Steffen)
