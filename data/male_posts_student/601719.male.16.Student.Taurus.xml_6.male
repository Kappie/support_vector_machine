Let me recap:  My grades got fixed and I got a very high GPA, they are now suffering again, I have a major crush, im getting tired of the way I dress, I'm bored with life. In fact, I'm very bored with life right now. I almost wish something radical would happen just so I could have a little change. I want to not live out in the middle of nowhere where I can't do anything social. There is only one person from school who lives somewhat near me but we're not friends. I never get to go swimming with my friends, I never get to go shopping, I never get to go to movies. I feel like I want to blog more often and the little makeover has encouraged me. Tomorrow I shall be more bloggy and thoughtful.
