Really, it hasn't. I haven't left the house apart from to go to school for a whole week, which shows exactly how much of a social life I have. None. (Not that I want one of course. Oh no.) Exams are drawing ever closer, and I still haven't started revising properly. Looking at Dickybod's blog, I believe it may be time for another rant, but as my life is so boring, it is difficult to have too much anger at things. I suppose my computer would be a good start, as I am here for the majority of the day. Let's see... what do I hate about my computer.?  1. I still have Windows 98. Not too bad I suppose, but XP would be nice. 2. My processor is only 533 MGH. Again, not too bad, but I would still like a nice 2.6 GHZ. 3. I have only 96MB RAM, which is fairly bad, as my computer is always running slowly, and programs keep crashing. 4. The fan makes a noise, not really loud, but loud enough that you can here the computer on when you walk past the open door to the room I am in. 5. The sound recorder program is brocken. It wont record anything, and I know the microphone is ok as it works on the webcam program. 6. I only have a 56KB dial-up internet connection. Very slow to download things; rather annoying. 7. This has only started happening recently, but when I am not online and open a folder such as 'My Documents' or 'My Computer', the dial-up box opens and trys to connect for no reason. 8. When I turn the computer on, and the desktop loads, 2 error messages appear, although these may be a good thing, as they stop the computer loading unneccessary programs.  9. My mouse wheel often gets dirty, and sticks which is rather annoying. 10. To burn a CD, I can't just drag from a folder to the CD folder for some reason. Instead I have to open a CD burning program. This would just about be ok, but for another unknown reason, this will only open when it is newly installed. I have to uninstall and re-install it every time I want to burn a CD.  That's just about all the major bad points. If I think of any more, they will also be posted.
