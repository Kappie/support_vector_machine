The specatators were split down the middle of the stands with all the Liverpool fans on one side and all the FC Porto supporters on the other. I was seated smack in the middle with a sea of red to my right and the green and red of Porto to my left. The over forty thousands fans were good and noisy on occasion, but for the most part there was a more subdued vibe due to the lacklustre play. Both teams were quite tenative during the first half of the game, with no scoring and only a handful of chances. Things got worse at the beginning of the second half when all the starters subbed-off so their backups could see some playing time. The best part of the game came after Porto finally scored with only five minutes left in the game. Liverpool woke up and showed some spirited play for remaining time getting a couple of great chanes, but alas, no goal.  Saterday afternoon I shopped around Toronto for a new laptop. Now that I am going to be on campus at Waterloo for another couple years, I figure it might make sense to take advantage of the wireless coverage. Here is my shopping list:      Under 5 pounds      12" display     Integrated wireless     CDRW/DVD drive    I found a  urlLink Sony Vaio V505  at a great price, but I am leaning toward a  urlLink Powerbook  cause its just so dead sexy.  Saterday night I met up with my sister and her friends for Sushi and chilling on the beach. Sunday it was off to the beach again, this time on Lake Erie with Lauren and her family. Monday it was back to Waterloo for some volleyball and a BBQ. Good friends and good food is the pefect way to end a weekend.
