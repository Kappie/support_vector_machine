I have to say that I'm glad.  There's a strange Father Syndrome I get from seeing the recruits whom I played a role in molding walk across the stage, thus making the transition from recruit to full-fledged Young Marine.  Plus, today was only a half-day, so I got to come home early.  To top it off, I finally have my Saturdays back (until we have drill on the 17th).  How sweet it is!  Just random stuff going on in my life: I won the Young Conductor's Contest, so I'll be conducting a march with the Waco Community Band on May 4th and I also won a $100 gift certificate to Holze's (which is actually what I need right now).  I'll be joining the esteemed (haha...right...) members of the National Honor Society on April 15th (or 14th, I'll have to look it up again); yeah, that's great...  At the end of this month is the National Young Marine of the Year competition (I have to start STUDYING!!!), and my feelings about that can be expressed in one word: AHHH!!!  We also have AP exams coming up at the beginning of May (U.S. Hist., Eng. Lang., and Government--oh, the dreaded gov't whose book I haven't looked at since last July...errrghsdfoiauwejr).  So, yeah, I have a busy month coming up.  But I love working under stress, I couldn't imagine doing anything else.  I'm also starting to change my career focus after some recent turn of events.  I love broadcast journalism and would love to do it, but I just don't think I'm the type of person whose cut out for that kind of job.  Journalists are more "DA" (Direct Action) type people.  I'm very much an "I-M" type of person (Influencing-Motivating).  Plus, I'm really sometimes at my happiest when I'm composing music, so...well, we'll see.  I'm looking into Northwestern U's music program--which is one of the best in the nation--and that could be serious possibility for my school of choice now.  However, it'll probably mean that I have to retake the SAT  again  because this last one will probably only get me into the 1300s at best.  And as a side note, I love the college admissions process.  I mean, it sucks and can be really stressful at times, but it's like a game.  We're all competiting, and you really  can't  know who's going to win.  I'm glad that I'm looking at really competitive colleges instead of going somewhere where I  know  that I'll get in; that's what makes the next year seem like the most challenging, stressful, mind-numbing, pain-inducing year yet.  But do you know what?  I wouldn't have it any other way.
