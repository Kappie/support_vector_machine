I'm just blogging quickly because otherwise Gwen'll kill me   I've got to go to GYWO so I'll make this brief.  >>Saw Sam get off the bus today, she was talking to Amy and some other woman whom I don't know. >>Still haven't been able to bring myself to ask Caroline if she's on MSN. For Christ's sake, what's the worst that could happen? Seriously... the worst that could happen is that she could say no and then that's not all that bad. >>Done my homework O_O' and scarier still I've done some serious trombone practice O_O'. I'm becoming... dare I say it... organised?  Love, Jon Roskilly
