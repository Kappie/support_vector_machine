If You Haven't Caught On Most Of My Titles Are Episode Titles From OTH, Names Of Songs, Lyrics From Songs, Or Just Pop Outta My Head! I Guess Today We Won't Be Going Grocery Shopping Or Going To The Eye Place! Tomorrow We Have To Go To A Funeral For A Guy That I Have Never Met (Sounds Like Fun, Huh?) So Instead Of Having Today Off My Dad Is Taking Tomorrow Off! I Think After The Funeral I Am Going To Stay At My Aunts (My Dad Has A Meeting To Go To Fri-Sun) So If I Don't Update My Blog For Awhile Everyone Will Know I'm Not Missing! I Am Currently Watching 'Man Behind The Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story' On VH1, The Movie Appears To be A Good Movie! I Wish They Would Have Showed Him When He Was Younger, Because From When The Movie Started Michael Acted Like A Child, And There IS Something From His Past That Causes Him To Act The Way He Does, I Hear It Was Because He Didn't Have A Childhood, But They Could Have Showed Some Of The Childhood He Didn't Have! Will, I'm Going To To End This Entry So I Can Go Watch The Movie- Bye!
