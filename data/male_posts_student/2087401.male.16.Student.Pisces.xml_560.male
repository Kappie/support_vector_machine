I would like to change the format. We're at 8 months. We're a blog in our prime, we're a prime blog.  Anyway, I really don't have anything to say. I sleep now. Not literally actually. It's more of a metaphorical sleep.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
