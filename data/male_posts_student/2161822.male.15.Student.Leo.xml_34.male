I have to wake up early and go to school for a half day. We won't even be doing anything. We're going to have a party for the upstairs hall. What fun. Because I'd really rather be in school eating poorly made cookies and drinking soda than be at home sleeping. I enjoyed the day off. I did...nothing. But it was better than being in school and doing nothing. Actually I got some wrapping of gifts done. I wrapped, let's see, 3 presents and then ran out of paper. Hey it's better than nothing and even better than less than nothing. I also got all the holiday cards done. Sorry, but I don't like Greetings Workshop too much. All the slogans for the cards are, in my opinion, stupid. "Where does a snowman go to dance?" (Kid opens card).."A SNOWBALL!" GET IT? (Kid realizes how stupid card is and starts to cry) Yeah, come on Greetings Workshop, let's get our acts together. Anyway I was on my daily stroll through my house and I noticed how beautifully decorated the house was. With the stockings hanging over the fireplace and the lights hanging outside, and the decorated tree. Ah Christmas just gets me in that holiday mood. You know the mood where you get all stressed because you don't have any presents for anyone and where you're in a bad mood because your relatives are coming over and the turkey is dry so you don't eat it and go hungry and where there's mass confusion everywhere..(catches breath) Yeah that mood. But really, I like Christmas. Not because of the presents, but because of the family togetherness. Makes you all warm and tingly inside. Ok I'm done bs'ing for now. Shanamanamanamana tonighttt! You should go check out Homestarrunner.com and watch some of the Strong Bad emails. Some funny stuff that doesn't make sense. Just the way I like it. Another good site is Rathergood.com. Both links should be in the free links section. I would put it here for convienience but the HTML isn't working right now and I don't feel like trying to fix it so this is where I shall leave and go to bed.  Listen to H.I.M.
