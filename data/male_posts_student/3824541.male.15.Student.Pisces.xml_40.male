How else would you hear about THIS DRAMA! "omgomgomgomg will he ever get back to florida?", "did he just call that dude hot?", "omgomgomg what a hottie!", and "omgomgomg teenage angst." You've been with me in the good, the better, and the best. You were here when I published Red Dress, and you, yes you, read everyone one of my posts, found every secret message, and have tried to emulate my style. :( I can see it didn't work out. omg 50!  So, now that fifty posts have passed, what do I plan to do? Well, first of all I've decided to chop down many rainforests in an attempt to give Brazillian people homes. After that I think I'm going to start a campaign against women, and later I may begin my own country. Sounds cool, huh? Well, the only way to hear about me and my attempts to Nirvana is to read my blog, or call me, but nobody ever calls me. :(  This conversation has been dead on arrival! Fall out boy rocks :D.  Also, if you haven't seen my blog links yet, scroll down and pay attention to the right! Yeah, I made all of those :). I'm working on other people's for other blogs now. If you want to request one then e-mail me at 'notask8r@gmail.com.'  Today was cool because I'm so cool. I made everyone's blog links, which I'm proud of, and I tried to start "The Odyssey" again, but I got distracted. :(. I'm going to fail if I don't start it soon.  Hmm, what's going to happen in the future? A ticker(See top of this post) should be up tonight with breaking news, and other facelifts. Stay tuned!  You can thank your lucky stars... That everything I wish for will never come true!
