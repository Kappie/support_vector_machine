Now I'm on a caffeine high that is quickly wearing off. Hopefully, I can get through the first two hours and survive till break, at which point another coke is in play. 
 Thought about the relationship between programming and art in the shower  the expression of an idea through well-understood means, with the computer being like the paint of the artist. It actually maps quite well I thought. I guess it started when the caffeine an' suger high was making me think of coke and pizzas. And merr.
