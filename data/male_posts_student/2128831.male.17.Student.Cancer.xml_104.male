I truly think that if Bush were to tell the homosexual community what he really thought of them it would so something like this: THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning. This past year, in a shocking act of civil disobedience, states all over gave the green light to open the gates of Hell and start marrying off pole-smokers and rug-munchers just as fast as their limp-wristed, little lady paw could sign swishy John Hancocks on Fagtown wedding licenses. To add insult to injury, Mr. Newsom – a Democrat, naturally – intentionally kicked off this abomination on Valentines Day, a holiday invented by Hallmark specifically so normal people could look down on queers.  Well society has another thing coming if he thinks I'm just gonna sit idly by with Laura's thumb up my ass while people take advantage of people like California Governor Schwarzenigger's wholesomeness by sanctifying the unholy unions of pitcher and catcher, butch and dyke, village person and other village person, and so on down the mincing Conga line.  Now, don't get me wrong. When you're nine years old, it's perfectly normal behavior to, say, get a little frisky with your fellow Camp Cayuga Cemosabe bunkmates – so long as it stays in the showers or the woods. But when you keep on playing "Doggy, Doggy, Where's Your Bone?" or "Fist the Tail of the Donkey" right into adultdom, you might as well have painted a pentagram on the ground with fetus blood, piss on the bible, and cry aloud, "Are you there, Satan? It's me, Mary!" And no, I ain't talking about the Virgin Matriarch.  As President, it is my responsibility to confront any and all such enemies of the libidinal status quo. And so this morning, in addition to calling on Congress to pass my constitutional amendment, I want to deliver a brief message to any sodomites who might be thinking of sashaying down to city hall to get themselves one of these novelty fake marriages. Here we go...  Attention all deviant abominations of the United States. This is your President you voted overwhelmingly against speaking. As you no doubt have been told, same-sex marriage is illegal in the states. That said, I know that many of you Adams and Steves believe that by breaking that law, you are being some kind of civil rights trailblazers. You think you're like that rude colored lady Rosa Parks, who suffered from delusions of non-inferiority. You think you're like that uppity broad Susan B. Anthony, who hallucinated that women are capable of having opinions. And yes, you probably think you're like Richard and Mildred Loving, who demanded that Virginia give them special rights to flaunt the unthinkable perversion of interracial marriage. Well guess what? You're right. You're just like all of those people – a sickening byproduct of liberalism. But just like my right-wing personal forefathers who fought tooth and nail against the aforementioned scum, I too shall do everything in my power to ensure that you remain second-class citizens: reviled, despised, and worthy only of being dragged for miles behind the pickup trucks of my most devoted ideological brethren.  In short, go ahead and try to marry your own gender. But know that when any man fucks with another man, he's also fucking with a Bush. And when you do that, a Bush gets nasty. And a nasty Bush is the last thing you wanna fuck around with. Just ask my dad, he knows.  I took his pension checks. And trust me I know a lot, my father thought me things.  So umm... there!   Then we have the damn Vatican Pope... The Vatican and Metrosexuality...  Imagine if it was true!! The following article appeared in The Onion.  Catholic Church Condemns Metrosexuality  VATICAN CITY—Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Monday that metrosexuality, the trend of heterosexual men co-opting the aesthetics of homosexual men, is strictly prohibited under Catholic doctrine. "The truly faithful will avoid the temptation to adopt this hip urban lifestyle," Navarro-Valls said. "The devout Catholic must remain on the path toward salvation, no matter how good he'd look in an Armani pullover, and no matter how much he might covet his neighbor's set of Williams-Sonoma lobster forks." Karl Weis, director of the New York-based activist group Freedom From Religion, responded to the ban by stating that "metrosexuality is so 2003."
