I was looking at ppl around... all going abt own their mundane lives... then i was thinking abt school and the past 3 months... hai... I came to the realisation that i have changed a lot since the beginning of the year... I used to think of myself as a person standing in the eye of the raging storm of life... each person was like a drop of water... swirling around and mixing together, following where the winds blows... I always saw myself as being in the centre of all this chaos, residing in the calmness of the eye... observing and being transfixed by all that was happening around me... the world revolved around me...following me where ever i go... I was neutral... the observer... Following each intriguing movement with the upmost curiosity... I was a like separate entity... But now I came to a realisation... I'm as much a part of this storm as anyone else... I'm a drop of water... swirling and flying on the winds of fate... Interacting together with the other drops of water... I'm part of this crazy world... Not some high and mighty being at it's centre... I must step out join the rest of the world in all its madness... I must step through the threshold and enter the tempest... The world beckons to me... how can one not go on through... I once told my class that i was like frosted glass, forever blur... But now I believe that this piece of frosted glass is beginning to become clearer, as it slowly warms up to the world around it...  1A01E rox my world... U guys change lives without even noeing it...  ps: it's amazing what latic acid can do to your mind... ha ha...
