I figure I'll head back to the car and wait out the storm and that's where I will probably be the safest, except I didn't remember which way I came from, any foot prints I had layed were wased away 5 steps back.  What was that? I could've sworn I saw Cynthias figure running in the distance, I took running off after her, yelling her name, every few minutes I would catch a glimpse of her, never being able to reach her. I thought the rain was drowing out my voice which would explain how she didn't hear me.  (i really dont feel like finishing this story)  I felt like I was running accorss something hard and I looked down to notice I was running accross the road once again, I looked down at at it, and turned around to see a car flying at me, breaks screeaching, it swereved and fish tailed, the rear end of the car collided with me, launching me back.    I woke up 3 days later in the hospital.  ~Fin     Bitches
