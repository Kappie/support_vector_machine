I'm one of those people who is all for putting Reagan's likeness on Mount Rushmore.  The way I see it, Reagan has done more for our country than any other president in history.  Washington did a great job leading our fledgling nation, Lincoln held us together during a civil war, and Eisenhower was just great all around, but besides them, none of our other presidents can hold a candle to Reagan.    Reagan dared to challenge the Soviet Union and he won.  Because of Reagan, millions of people can live free, without the fear of Communism always in the back of their minds.  Because of Reagan, the Berlin Wall, the symbol of the Iron Curtain, fell and thus became a symbol of capitalism and democracy.  Because of Reagan, I don't have to fear Soviet missiles being aimed at my country.  I very much regret not having been alive during Reagan's presidency.  It must have been so exciting to be an American during that time!  Now, however, I have a new conservative president to watch.  President George W. Bush faces a threat that is comparable to that of the Soviet Union; the threat of radical Islam.  The radical Muslims are every bit as bent on the destruction of America as the Soviets were, and the Muslims have religion to fuel them.  I pray that President Bush will have the courage to stand alone in the international community and say "Enough!  No more suicide bombings!  No more genocide! No more oppression of other religions!"  Peace through strength is a trademark of great leaders, and I pray that President Bush will not bow to pressure from arrogant France, or from other nations that, because they are so mired in pluralism, can't even see the danger that is right in front of their face.  These nations have kept their mind so open that it fell out, and idiots in high places can have disastrous consequences.   The jury is still out on George W. Bush.  He hopefully has four more years in which he can either live up to Reagan's standard, or fail to do so.  May God grant him the courage and strength to lead with excellence.
