Last night i spend most of (lol) the night with jessica and that was good except for when she was pouting then i just had to wait it out.  But i still really had a good time, im gonna miss her alot 8 days is a long time but then again it isnt, it just depends on how u look at it.  o well i just hope she has a good time down there (i think she is already).  Today was alread really busy, no time for relaxing for me.  right when i woke up, which was way to early for when i went to bed, i got ready to go fishing and i was at the lake from 9 or 10 until 3:30.  but then again i only really fished for an hour or two rest of the time i was gettin the bon fire ready or eating with bryndan.  Then after that i went to go play tennis with hilton and got more sunburned, ohh yeah and he nailed me in the chest (accidnetly lol right) with the ball it felt like i had got shot!! then me and bryndan rode around tonight well actully i drove around and bryndan and sarah b rode around lol that was interesting.  it was a good first day thought i didnt get to talk to jes all day though :( o well tom i will hopefully be able to.  g'night im out.
