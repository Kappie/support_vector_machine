He said he swallowed all his [anti-depressant] pills. I was shocked and said "Um, ok, call me tomorrow."  Today I got some SMS's asking me if I belived him. We had a quick relay of SMSs saying that I did rah rah rah. Eventually I snapped and said "Why wouldn't I believe you? What is there for me not to believe? Why did you do it in the first place?" Needless to say, I didn't get a reply. I called him a few times, and he didn't answer. I got an SMS saying "hey gorgous i wont be able to talk 4 a while but i love u. And dont 4 get it. Im in a clinic and i have to hand in my fone".  I'm thinking about calling "BULLSHIT" because meh. Why would you say "I love you" and then 5 minutes later OD on anti-depressants? Meh. He could just be attention seeking. But MEH! I'm sick of it.  He can call me when he gets out. Or never.   I'm over this shit.
