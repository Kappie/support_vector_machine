Nothing real fancy to see on this screen but I will point out that the textarea's where you enter the messages in are resizable.  I haven't looked to see if they are actually text area's or if they are iframe's, but this is something that you don't usually see in web site.  Users are usally confined to the exact size that the web developer set. urlLink
