I am pretty vocal in class (I need to shut up sometimes) but honestly a lot of the time I end up raising my hand and commenting because so few people do!  Our class discussions consist of about five people talking, and everyone else just sitting there, and I think it would be really nice for everyone to get involved.  Just sharing a thought...
