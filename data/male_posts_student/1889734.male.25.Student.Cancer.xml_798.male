Yeah, they are graphic and disturbing, but much like the Nick Berg video, I think it is important that we confront evil for what it is.  Those of us who support the war have a responsibility to consider the nastiness and brutality of the conflict - it's easy to give lip service if you don't consider what it really means. Those of you who oppose the war might want to try to understand what the Islamic world has in store for us if we continue to show weakness.  It's your choice.
