Although there were flaws, they were acceptable since this was Zach Braff's first movie, and since its beauty and spectacle decisively outweighed them.  Yesterday, Jonny and I went to Rockport.  That was fun, notwithstanding some vomitrocious occurences.  I wish I could have stayed there longer.  We saw "De-Lovely," which reminded me of how bad movies could get.  It also reinforced my opinion of music from musicals.  I won't get too specific, but let's just say it sucks more suckily than the suckiest suckfest that ever sucked.  Yeah, I know, I've used that phrase too much.  Today (after returning from Rockport), I saw "The Hunting of the President" at the Coolidge Corner Theatre, the only location near me at which it's playing anymore.  I liked it; its points were much less far-out than "Farenheit 9/11" (whose message was nonetheless true), and I think all or the far majority were accurate.  If Steph had gone to it, though, she probably would have exploded Ã  la fembots.  Tomorrow, I hope to start my work.  I also hope to write something.  We'll see how those go.
