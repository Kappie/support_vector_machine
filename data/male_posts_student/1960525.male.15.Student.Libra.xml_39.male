At his surprise b-day party we are reacquainted with his friends, the rich kid Harry and his romantic interest Mary-Jane.  The seemingly final straw in his life as Spiderman conflicting with his life as Peter is when he misses the a performance of MJ's play, and she is very upset with him and when is powers begin to fail on him he gives up his life as Spiderman and Peter Parker's life greatly improves.  He does well in school and finally makes it to MJ's play, and everything seems to be going better, except Harry wont let up with his vengeance of killing Spiderman as pay-back for his fathers death.  Once he learns that MJ is getting married, he crumbles again, soon a time comes when he realizes that he must be the friendly-neabiorhood-Spiderman.  It was both an action and a romance, but the sappy stuff was worth it to see Spidy get his ass handed to him by a six-armed villain.  All in all, you should see this movie, but don't stay till the end, there isn't anything special, I waited and found nothing, thanks.
