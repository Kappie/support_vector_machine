So here's a little of both:   Tip of the Day   Basic: Open the door for your lady. There is no reason a woman should have to open her own door when a perfectly able-bodied gentleman is standing idlely behind her. Step forward, reach out, open the door, and invite her to enter before you do. In addition to saving her a little extra work, it allows her to make a more stunning entrance...instead of forcing her to deal with the door as she clumsily enters the room.  More Detailed: Greet her in a mature and polite manner. "Hey.", "Wuz up?",  and "You're hot!" are not appropriate greetings. Use something akin to "Good evening" or "You look beautiful". Make her feel less like an object and show her that you appreciate the time she has put into looking good for you (and everyone else at wherever you're going). Combinations and different versions of such polite greetings are nearly endless and can add a few extra points. Examples would be similar to: "You look beautiful this evening" or "That is a lovely outfit you're wearing". But make sure you greet and then compliment. If you don't greet first, things can seem a little off or moving too fast.
