While you're there, don't forget to pick up your "peaceful political activists" button. I think you can get your parking validated and reduced admission price to the Museum of Sex. I'm not making this up. "It's no fun to protest on an empty stomach," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday, when he announced the program at NYC  Company, the city's tourism office, which will distribute the buttons to all comers to its Midtown office. I suppose the only good time to protest on an empty stomach is while on, for instance, a hunger strike. Perhaps I'm just pointing out the obvious.  Trade in your " Lick Bush. Beat Dick. " bumper sticker for one of these protest buttons and be on the side of the good guys. Its the right thing to do and, besides, it could save you serious money at Applebee's. Try the Freedom Fries. Whatever you do, don't go to Central Park with your friends and, um, say anything political.
