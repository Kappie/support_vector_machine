I just found out like 1/2 an hour ago that my friend Kyle it going to prom with Tina as friends.  Which I must admit, did make me angry, for a few reasons that I will not mention at this moment. Then I got a talk about how Tina isn't my property, and I shouldn't be angry at Kyle for this, when I wasn't REALLY angry at him, I was just kinda angry...but...I'm getting over it as we speak. I'm gonna be so happy when I go to Japan, because that is a basically 2 weeks away from all this High School drama, it will just be me and a whole bunch of Japanese students...with an American thrown in here and there. I hate being a teenager.....it's so FRUSTRATING!!! I don't know if it's the raging hormones or sumthin' else...but.....we are definately F***ED UP!!  So....Tina was going to talk to me and try and make everything better just before I went and ignored everyone and that apparently made her sad/mad/depressed...so...now I feel like shit*does that mean I hit the fan??? I dunno*  and so...she doesn't want to talk to me anymore...and I've also been informed that I'm really immature...so..I feel MORE like shit.....Why does she have to hate me so much?!?!?! Am I really that a horrible of a person???  No, if you read this I'm not triyng to make you sound like a horrible person...so don't even go there!  Great, now I'm angry at sumthing....I'm gonna go take a shower.  Peace!  Spense
