Do I try to get ahold of a copy before?  Do I really need to go see Benny?    Horns  Halos isn't playing in Dallas anymore...I guess two weeks was more than enough.  Shit.  However,  urlLink Soft Skull Press , publishers of  urlLink Fortunate Son  (the infamous George W. bio), might be interested in publishing some of my prose.  I haven't asked them yet, but they seem like pleasant chaps.  Who knows...I need publishings though!
