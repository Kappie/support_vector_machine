It's Thursday night, and I leave for yonder shores (i.e. England!) on Sunday, the day of the Sun. I've just been basically hanging out, concocting songs in my head, playing keyboard and guitar, all the usual stuff. I've whiled away my time babbling nonsense to people on MSN, just a load of dreary hot air about rubbish, and music. Mostly rubbish. Okay, I confess, this post has one solitary purpose, to post a quotation that I just found from George W. Bush.  It's good to know that my journal now has the contrivance of "quote of the day".  I'm getting on better now with my Stepmum and my Father, which is nice.  When my sleep finally overcomes my brother we're gonna watch 'The Battle of Algiers', which will be nice. It's in black and white, and French so it should be nice and hideously dodgy. Anyway, that is my post consummated. Good night, I probably won't post again until I am ensconced firmly back in England.  Mood: Wretched Music: Metallica - Wherever I may Roam; System of a Down - Needles; Quote of the Day: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our people - and neither do we" ~ George W. Bush.
