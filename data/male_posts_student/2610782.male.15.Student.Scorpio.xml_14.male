Went to the school library to return books.Oh, how the school librarian would cringe and shriek if she ever  reads  the books in the science fiction section.Well,not only the science fiction section,the fantasy and horror ones too.Hey,don't you know whats up with them?They've got explicit content,you know,romantic pervert kinda stuff.Of course,you wouldn't be able to tell from whatever thats written on the covers of the books.Well,its not a revelation to me and no,I don't go searching specifically for these types,its kinda like a package you know?You go searching for science fiction and you get something more.Well,lets see.......how many of us are complaining?  Untill then.   urlLink
