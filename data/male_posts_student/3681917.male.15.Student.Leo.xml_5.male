I started this little blog in an attempt to get my name out. A friend and I had a crazy idea to become one of those opinionated radio talk show hosts. I figured this is a good start. As for now...well I am busy waiting for my new mac tomorrow :D. Busy folding proteins for the Folding@home project as well. Don't think my poor little computer can handle constant 111.2 degrees F for much longer. But anyways, cant wait till tomorrow...if i get a new one pics will be posted right away :D
