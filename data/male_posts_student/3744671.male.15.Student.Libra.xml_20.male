What the fuck? For me, that was the BIGGEST SELLING POINT of the first Xbox (besides Halo and Dead or Alive 3). I like my Xbox's hard drive better than those lame, piece of shit memory cards for PS2 and GameCube. However, you can get a hard drive for PS2, but the crooks make you shell out more cash for it! I know Microsoft if talking about an add on hard drive like Sony did (that would piss me off!!!!) or having Flash Memory, but I still just want my fucking hard drive! I mean, if I need to move files, then I'll buy a flash memory stick or a memory card but if I'm playing at home where I don't need to transfer, give me a damn hard drive, don't make me pay an additional sum just to get the "privellage" to save my game!  Second, Microsoft is probably ruled out backwards compatibility. Now, I know they will probably have some issues because ATI is doing the chips for Xbox 2, and nVidia did Xbox, but still something I wish they could try and work around. I would be glad to wait an extra month or so for them to do this so I don't have to keep my Xbox hooked up, which would take up too much space. It's getting cluttered by my TV already with my Xbox, TV, VCR, games, DVDs, and soon to be GameCube.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
