This isn't anything new this squables have been going on for like a long time ago, but this time there getting more violent, and stupid, such an example of why they're getting stupid is that for some reason my aunt keeps involving my mom's best friend in everything when they get into fight's saying, "if it was for her you'd do anything". I personally think she's jealous becouse my mom has a better friend than she does or she just wants her to herself, but i dont know. These fight's are slowly escalating to the point where all it this anger needs is just a spark to burn like hell, and that spark will no doubtedly invovle me. Anyway on a lighter note my school is infested with roaches, this morning when i was waiting for the bell to ring i had to take a piss real bad and i didn't feel like going to the second floor so i went to the first floor bathroom and so the lights were off and so i walked in a step and turnes on the light next thing i see are like a shit load of roaches moving around and im like "WHHAT THE HELL!" and i walked out and like a few followed me out. so i was like ok i can take my chances and go back inside there and get to the  other side of the wall where all the stalls are and take a piss and most likely have roaches jump out of everywhere and attack me until im on the ground having my skin eaten by roaches, or i can delay for another minute or two and go upstairs and take a piss where it migfht be safer? "I think i'll go to the second floor" Afterwards i kept seeing roaches here and there in the halls and i was like damn where's The Department of public Health.while on the subject of school ive got a 4 page/750 word minimun report on Holland/Netherlands to do -yay- me im just shining with joy that its just to unrealistic *tear* and another *obese tear*.
