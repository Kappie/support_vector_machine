So in gym we're playing Softball... hmm not my best sport, but I'd have to say I made a pretty impressive catch both day and yestday... it made me pretty happy.  I'd have to say not many sports made me happy this year, volleyball (suck at it but  like it) and football have been the only two I've liked.  Hmm o well, its all almost over *grin*    So after gym I had a pretty uneventful school day.  Miss Pangborn informed us all that the underclassman year books will be here Wednesday... That sounds fun.  I waited for my bus until about 3:40 just to sit on it for another half hour plus... arg as Steve says, "Our bus driver sucks so bad she should be arrested for prostitution."  So then my sister drove me to Bigler Field for the Special Olympics Opening Cerimony with the State College High School Marching Band... WHOO HOO... honestly tell me why I joined for another year?  Does it get fun? Was I brainwashed? Am I that much of a loser? Well I guess it can be fun... High Way is fun. The Ceremony went well...  My sister came and picked Me and Chad up... It was a surprisingly quiet ride home...  I didn't have any  real  homework, I should do the math review (first third due monday) or the biology review (don't remember most of it), but I decided to eat some cookie (that my sister so kindly made for the family) and come online to talk to all my wonderful friends (Chad and Chris D).    Well I guess I let myself ramble again... sorry 'bout that...  -Dan V
