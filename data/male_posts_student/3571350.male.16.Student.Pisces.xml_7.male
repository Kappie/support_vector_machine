It's funny how the weather can affect your mood because if it's sunny your up-beat and happy but when it rains your tired and bored usually napping like my parents are right now. I never nap. I always have something to write or watch or do. Btw is it just old people(theyre about 50 and im 16) that take naps 4 in the afternoon when it's raining? Kevin visited my blogsite :)+He thinks im cool! Plus he's cool to. Hollywood Squares is on. Charo is sometimes scary and funny. shes like YES YES YES. Then im saying calm down for crying out loud! You think the jokes are scripted? Most of them aren't even close to being funny. Melissa Peterman is the funniest i think and if you don't know she's from wb's-Reba. Wilson Philips are on On Air with ryan seacrest. theyre actually good. well I just hope my parents make supper or ill go to the store and buy some doritos. They are my favourite kind of chips! I wuv my dog. she's a black labrador and her name is sacha and she's 11 years old. I love her to soo much. I hope she doesn't pass away soon i will be depressed for so long when she does. Well gonna stop and ill most likely be back writing tonight :)
