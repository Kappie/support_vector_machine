He was very supportive and understanding of my situation. He offered the following suggestions:  1. Go to the Georgia Career Information Center website. I haven't looked at it yet, but he told me it allows for a comparison between professions. Also it has extensive data on salaries, education, opportunities, and other facts about careers in the state of Georgia. 2. Talk with the faculty on-campus at the Technical Communications department. Ask them about their experiences and backgrounds. Discuss the possibilities not just in TCom, but in writing and communications in general. 3. Visit with the faculty of other universities. Seek out advanced students who are about to graduate from degree programs that interest me. Find out what they would do differently or the same.  4. Seek out professionals in the fields that interest me. Ask to interview them for information or tag along with them for a portion of their day to see what their duties are like. Ask them what they like or dislike about their job and their industry in general.  So in the next few days I will be doing just that. The website sounds like a great source of information. We discussed when it might be prudent for me to change my major and transfer to another school. Six weeks or so is the time frame for the Summer Semester.   To sum it up, I went in being lost, and came out with a better understanding of how to find the path. I promised to get back with Mr. Hughes when I am more certain of the path I am going to take. He was a good guy, and really wanted to help me.
