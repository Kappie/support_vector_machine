I go out every day to hang out with my friends. Plus thanks Maddy for caring for me :) Don't worry i'd never hurt or kill myself i'm not that kind of person. Well i'm going to update you on everything that has happened so far. Well last week I had my first session of therapy with my therapist Lise. She's really ice and stuff. It was just about getting information and stuff and why I was there and I just started crying about my situation. I'm going back next friday. Also tennis has been on television about 10 hours! Plus i've been goin to the movies with my friends last week and some parts of this week. I'm still in a grumpy and shitty mood with my parents. They HAVE stopped fighting but I just don't like 'em. They way they treat me the way they expect me to treat them like i'm suppose to worship them when they come in the room and give my seat to them every time and change the channel every time like they own my soul. I'm not in a very let's say happy mood. It is mostly bored and not very exciting about much because I know it will end in sadness. Is that depression? I don't think I'm depressed i'm mostly mad than sad. Plus all my MADNESS is inside and how dare I let it go in the house or outside because that would be embarrasing and letting my parents down and that's a SIN in this house. oooo. Also my mom told me my dad was healed of athritis. You can believe what you want but I BELIEVE in miracles since I'm roman catholic. His knuckles were soo sore and swelling really big but i think she said two years ago he went to the Virgin Mary's statue or vigil? and prayed and asked to be healed of it. Then when he came home he took his pills for it but it just made him even more sick so he decided to stop taking them and after like a week or 3 days it was completely gone. Again believe whatever you want but it was a miracle and arthritis like his was incurable and it was gone. Also I'm not really full of energy anymore. What should I do and I feel fat when other people say I'm not. Im 6'0 and about 155-160 lbs. Well I hope I got you up to date!
