Both in Email and U.S. Mail. About college.  I get information about every small college that I've never heard of.  Thats why they mail me this crap, because I would never know about them otherwise.  But it's like fucking spam, all the time, 10-20 emails a day, 3 to 5 letters a day, the occasional giant envalope with about 80 pages on the college I don't care about.  Getting on my goddamn nerves.  It's like those internet CD's you don't ask for.  If I want an AOL disc, I can grab one at just about every store.  And last time I checked...I was already a member to AOL!  Christ.  -  Note: Quesadias are delicious.
