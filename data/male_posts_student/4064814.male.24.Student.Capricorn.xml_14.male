For those of you who may not know this guy pretty much invented  urlLink XML  and is now Technology Director at Sun Microsystems.   I have been working at Open Text over the summer and have been tasked with the tightening up the next version of  urlLink Livelink  before its release.  This takes the form of many tiny bug fixes with an occasional in-depth code optimization.  I have found it easy for me to loose sight of all the cool things we do here.  Recommender Systems, Dynamic Text Summarization, Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Classification: These are all pretty hot research areas and there are a bunch of Phd's here applying some of the most cutting edge stuff and occasionally making it work.
