Bastard  Computer  Standings (Bowl Championship Series)  First in 2000 it screwed Miami outta the national championshiop, when we had beaten FSU, then FSU got it's ass handed to them. Miami woulda killed The damn Sooners.  Now this year, USC is screwed, if your #1 in both polls, you should play int eh national championship game right?! Nope, they play no. 4 Michigan in the Rose Bowl.  when Hawaii and Boise state ahve a say in the national championship game and Cuse and Notre Dame, that's wrong. So LSU snuck by .16 in the title game. There may be 2 champions which is what this system wanted to stop.  also there's Miami FSU II which i'll get to tomorrow. ______________________ Another day, another post.
