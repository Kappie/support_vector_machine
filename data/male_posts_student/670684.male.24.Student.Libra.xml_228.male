My best vacations are the ones where I don't sleep...where five hours a night is a long time...where I'm grabbing a late night breakfast with friends, and then up for an early morning breakfast with other friends.  When Daniel Harr picked me up at DFW yesterday, he asked how the trip was.  "Really nice," I said, because it was.  "Oh," he said, taking the loop to get back to 183 South.  "It sounded pretty boring."  To be honest, it was.  Well, the last four or five days were.  You can only sit at the pool so long, eat out so many times, watch so many baseball games (which, as I learned this past week, is quite a few) before the need for productivity takes over.  I demand productivity from myself.  It's why my EQ characters are so low considering I've played the game for two years...so often I prepare to log on and get a few hours in when I realize I've got writing to do.  There is always writing to do when you're a writer.    I had a real tough time writing on the screenplays out in California.  I do a lot of good thinking out there...I've got plenty of time to think when I'm there, especially in Palm Springs (something about a city you know...not needing to pay for anything when you're there helps too), where I can sit by the pool, sit in the pool, work the stairmaster, watch a movie, drive the old folks around, all the while looking at the majestic San Jacinto Mountain.  But getting into the mode to work festidiously on a script can't really happen.  The family wants too much from me.   You do your writing  they say, meaning well, but haraunging me about where we're grabbing lunch, of if I'm going to drive someone somewhere.  The freedom of a California vacation is the freedom of Weber's gilded cage.    My grandparents assume I'm helpless, mainly because my father is.  I live off $1300/mo, and they think I'm a fast spender because I pay atrocious car insurance premiums (fuck car insurance, by the way...I think waylaying marriage at this point is the most mature thing to do, and I pay out the ass for it...that and I have a dick...my lack of menstruation costs me $100/mo).  I'll be the first person in my family to get a post-grad degree, and they think it's because I'm lazy.  I can't blame them, though...writers are fascinating because you don't see them work.  If you see them working, you're going to ask  What are you working on?  and then they're not working anymore.    I'm at the auto dealership.  I won't write here.  I might play some EQ.  I bought a New York Times, but they had internet connection.  Your average debutante walked in an hour ago, leathered fake tan, but still good looking.  She stood next to me for a few minutes, looking at what I was doing, unable to ask though.  But she was just standing there...any conversation starter from me would be a come-on.  So I offered her the New York Times, just to get talking.   Oh no  she said.   I'm sorry.   And she left to read a magazine.  Granted, we weren't going to run off to Garland to copulate and work finance jobs, but 20 minutes of chat about the murky weather and school is never too bad.  And maybe she needs an escort to the next ball.  Sunday, in La Jolla, standing outside, breathing in the saltwater air, I didn't want to leave.  For that moment, I wanted to stay in California for a very long time, just living on the beach, growing my hair out, surfing a lot, picking up acoustical guitar, getting some silly job and having a lot of fun for a few years without any semblance of responsibility.  Today, early in the morning, sitting at an Arlington car dealership, playing grabass until I can go visit a lot of friends, I'm glad I'm here.  But that's the funny thing about me.  No matter where I am, I'm always happy that I'm there.   Dan Harr...the shit revelations are in the May archives...first one around May 19 I think, second a week after.
