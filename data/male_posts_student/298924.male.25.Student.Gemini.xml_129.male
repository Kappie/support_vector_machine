I am in Atlanta now and earlier I was at my Uncle Steve's house (where my dad is staying) in Decatur....we talked about alot.....but I think the biggest thing was the idea for a family reunion....with all of the set backs that my family has faced in the past year we pretty much came to a consensus that a family reunion is in order....spearheaded by my cousin Steve, with the idea that we need to get together under happy occassions instead of always getting together when a loved one dies (as has been the case for a while now)....I really hope we can make that happen....  In other news I am in town for Father's Day but more importantly my Dad is having surgery tomorrow at 6am....please remember him in prayer....hopefully this will be the end of this saga and we can continue to move forward with life.....  Happy Father's Day.....I know I'm happy
