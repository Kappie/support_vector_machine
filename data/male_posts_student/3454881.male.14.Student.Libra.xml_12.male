Those people are wondering if the cities Sewer systems can get rid of the water quick enough. The city of Sioux Falls took a high tech camera to check out the condition of the cities Sewer System. They found something very suprising to them, they had just found a gas line right in it. If a big storm went through the area, debris and a lot of water travel through there making that very dangerous. If somebody would just throw a lit cigarette it could blow up the whole street! This high tech camera also found Cable, phone, electric, and city water lines down there! MidAmerican (the company responsible for the gas lines) says that it trusts it's employees to build it right. MidAmerican and the other company's says will start fixing the problems as early as next Tuesday.  This story was written by Jared Drenkow, the Info came from KDLT.
