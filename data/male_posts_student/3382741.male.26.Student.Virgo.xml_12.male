They instead talked almost exclusively about the gay issue.  the amazing thing is how much we really agree on.  we all agree that the Bible says that any sex (or lust or thought of sex etc ... ) outside marrige is sin.  But they say I am trying to defend homosexuality becuase I don't beleive that having the attraction and such is a sin.  they were like "just give us a year and follow what we say to the letter and really want to change and you can have deliverence from this ... " blah blah.  i tried that i have been there it didnt work.  they say that it didnt work becuase i "put a time limit on God".  and yes i did decide after like two years of misery and no change that i was going to stop trying to be something i am not.  so really no ground was made either way.  i am going to be put out of church tomorrow and it looks like its over the gay issue and not the Bible issue.  according to the Bible you are NOT supposed to talk to other people about a discipline issue (unless you are asking them to come for the 2nd phase as a witness).  HOWEVER it seems that my grandfather told my mom about all this ... she in turn has told all my brothers and sistes ... even my uncle knows and has sent me an email continuing the fussing.  they dont follow thier own precious rules when it doesnt suit them.  talked to kevin after the meeting.  he has realized how nuts they had gone with the getting people out there for the meeting and knows i dont really want that.  he is now working to stop all the crazyness about it.  i dont really care who comes ... the fact that my friends are going to be there to support me is plenty enough.  kevin even says he will do his best to keep his mouth shut.  we will see what happens but as long as there isnt press i dont think i will be upset by it.  life goes on
