I went out and mowed, but nothing big.Today I did install several peices of software, and aranged my icons and desktop a little, but the basics are the same.  Anyway, I'll be going right now. Like I said before; that's about it. I might get on and post the software later, but only if I don't feel too lazy. =-P See ya. Bye. Back to folding towels.
