From there I went to some place to eat. Its new, all I had was a cheeseburger and my opinion on it, is was alright. Cant remember the name of it though. Then I went to my moms work and walked over to my cousins and layed on her futon. I love that thing. She had to go the mall so I went back to Justins and we lit off those little fireworks called Bees. After that, I just chilled I guess. Oh yeah, btw my hand hurts and has little places, but its fine ^_^. We went home and then back to Brittanys to get my retainer O_o. So then I went to the mall with Karen, just me and her lol. We walked around pretty much the whole store. Then I went home, had me a Georgia Peach, and then Robbie came over. We were hitting whiffle balls with golf clubs towards Macis House. Then all the sudden to cop cars pulled up and four cops got out. Wow. They went in and came out 30 mins lata. We were gonna go get Brittany but when we got in the coldasack(sp?) Daneille told us to leave right now. It was crazy. So then me and Robbie got on Broom sticks and flew up and down the road. Then I called Alaina, and we talked forver. Im out. Jesus Rocks, You bet he does
