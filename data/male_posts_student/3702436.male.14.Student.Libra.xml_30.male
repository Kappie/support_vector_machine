Nor is this  2)a site to glorify ourselves and to prove how 'team' and united we are, and how great everything Raffles is.we dont need to do this, thank you very much, becauseat the end of the day it wouldnt make much of a difference how anyone else felt about us. i dont need to go into the'this is my blog and my place towrite and i have freedom of speech' and all that blah. case in point: do u think we're gna change our sch colours or our leotards to pink and purple anytime soon? (ok we were only toying with the idea tts all). the colours should be casting a light and scherzo atmosphere around this place, not flooding this place wif ridicule and scorn towards other people. so once again, i'd like to remind everyone that it isnt much point getting offended over anything u see here, because its to take for bird bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. tt's all. maybe when other people see this theyre gonna have more to say or think, but ur not going to change the fact that we're posting our personal thoughts a memories here, and its pointless getting worked up over anything.  gdnite.
