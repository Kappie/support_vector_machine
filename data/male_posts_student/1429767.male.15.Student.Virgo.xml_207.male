His cousins and their fiances were over Saturday, we just hung out and played cards with them, it was pretty fun... Josh's cousins are cool, Amy and Carin, they like to party and have fun so they're cool with me! Then on Sunday we were going to the beach with his cousins, but since I still can't get any lake water in my nose we didn't go. I would've been more than happy to go anyway, I didn't have to swim, just being on the beach rocks to me. They ended up staying there the whole day until like 11 at night so I would've seen that sunset! I'm really sorry that I missed it, I love sunsets and a sunset over Lake Michigan is one not to be missed if you get a chance to see it. Well today I left Josh's at about twelve since I am supposed to clean the basement today I had to come home... But you know what? I'm not going to do it! HA! Honestly though I don't really feel good today to do anything like that I just want to go back to sleep, my back hurts and my head is pounding again! So right now I'm probably going to go lie down for a while or something so I'll post much more later...
