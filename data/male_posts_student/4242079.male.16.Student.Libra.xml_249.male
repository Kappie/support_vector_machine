Also playing was Broken Chairs and Sons of Daughters. All three bands were incredible. I miss shows so much...  Megan beat me to buying the Minolta Z1 today, but I will be paying for mine within a few days, with any luck. w00t w00t, yo!   Don't let this happen, I don't want it to be like this, but you, you make it happen, you cause it to be like this. I hate you for showing me that there are still good people out there. I wanted to die alone in hate, but you showed me there are still people out there who actually care. I hate you for that.
