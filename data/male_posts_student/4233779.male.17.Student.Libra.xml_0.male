We've spent hours at the beach swimming between huge waves and I got sunburt [ouch!] I have to say I hate going to the beach but this time was great. I'm gonna miss days like these in Madrid.    Saturday night was hilarious. We went to some discos and... a girl grabbed my ass! lol! Poor girl, she must be passing through some kind of strange phase. lol. We didn't like the discos nor the songs they were playing, so we prefered to spend the rest of the night walking, talking, laughing and having an ice-cream. Nice, isn't it? We came home around 3:45 but kept talking until 5:30 or something like that.    Now I'm back at home and I've been packing ALL my stuff. It hasn't been an easy process though. Despiting the large amount of shit I've compiled all over these years, the hardest part of all the packing hours has been finding things from my childhood. I've cried for the first time in a long time. It's not that I haven't cried in a long time, is that I barely remember crying like that. Once I started, I couldn't stop in 25 or 30 minutes. I think moving to Madrid's gonna be much harder than I though [if that's possible]      Anyway, I should start to think in a brighter way cause I'll be in my new place in less than two days. My next post will be from the capital. I gotta go now, it's really late and I still have to pack some more. Take care.      Santi
