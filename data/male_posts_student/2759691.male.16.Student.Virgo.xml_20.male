Keyes, who promised "a good fight," is trailing in the polls and has almost no chance of victory. Does Alan Keyes really believe he can bean the star of the democratic convention? The answer is no. The reason Alan Keyes is really running— or atlest  part  of the reason— is to block the charismatic Obama from making rounds around the country campaigning for John Kerry. But, nevertheless, he has a right to run if he so desires. But there's just one little problem: Keyes doesn't actually  live  in Illinois. He's got to move to Illinois in order to be elected. Even Keyes acknowledges he faces an "uphill battle," and according to me, a battle he will probably lose.
