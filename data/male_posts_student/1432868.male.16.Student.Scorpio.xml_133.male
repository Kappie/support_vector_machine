Now taking drivers ed. which is slightly more sporific (SAT word!!) than taking some Valium. but yeah, I am kinda not sure what to do know, I want to say something witty and funny that you actually laugh at, or I could just bitch and moan about stuff and spill my emotions to you faithfull readers (random guy/girl who clicks on the link to my site by accident). The only problem is I really don't have much to moan about. I am not so depressed/happy/angry/ w/e to be even slightly interesting. Well I'm gonna just be sitting here some more and think of something to write on this site but wait..... one more thing   20:33:00) Tim: whether to go the "i really like you" route or "wanna go out sometime" route (20:33:11) Jason: it always helps to practice with your lamp beforehand (20:33:28) Jason: they usually respond favorably (20:33:38) Tim: whaaaaaaaaaat?

(20:34:10) Jason: no (20:34:12) Jason: of course not (20:34:21) Jason: the lamp gets turned on  guys it was meant as a joke please do not take that seriously.  ehh I'm going back to my lamp.....  remember click my e-mail if interested in date!!
