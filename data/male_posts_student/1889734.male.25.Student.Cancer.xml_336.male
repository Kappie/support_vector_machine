Kodak is slashing 15,000 jobs due to a shift from film to digital media for photography.  Recently, they announced that they will no longer sell film cameras.    Kodak is essentially trying to retool and survive the new wave of technology.  Good for them.  But now we have 15,000 people who also need to retool and survive.  What's the answer?  I'm sure unemployment and government benefits will be the first thing touted to help these people.  The Democrats will decry the job loss as a consequence of the Tax Cuts and Halliburton.  Progress is evil and people are harmed.  So should we subsidize film?  A Film Camera Tax Credit?    Everyone needs to be prepared to change lives at a moments notice.  There is no such thing as security.  You have to accept that and prepare yourselves as best you can.  BUt most of us aren't willing to accept the consequences of freedom, preferring to look to others to provide security through laws and spending.  Bah, I guess I'm just in a bad mood today.  Tired of the whining and the crying about 'fully funding education' and such drivel from the Left.  Tired of the war bashing, space bashing, anti-progress wing wanting to turn to unions and taxes and subsidies and pouring yet more money into the black hole of social experiments.
