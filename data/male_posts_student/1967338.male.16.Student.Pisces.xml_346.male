So I'm alive, too, and just thought you might care to know that.  Oh, and the play last night wasn't THAT bad.  It was kinda funny.   On the scary side of funny.  haha.  ::shriek::  That kind of funny.  :D  AAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!  IIIIITTTTTCCCCCHHHHHH!!!!     History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.
