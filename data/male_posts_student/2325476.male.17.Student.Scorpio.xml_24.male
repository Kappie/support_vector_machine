I love Outkast, or more specifically Andre3000, his messages are often so wonderful, and the mixture of hip-hop, and jazz, maybe a little pop, funk, and rock is just glorious.   "... and if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?"  As introverted as I am, people are awesome. I mean, I love my alone time, I love being introspective and trying to figure out who i am, or why i feel like i do, but a) i can't really get to the bottom of any of that without interacting with people, and b) things just tend to be so much more exciting and enjoyable when in the company of friends. I need to start hanging out with some more cool people.   I'm going up to VA this weekend, which is gonna be awesome, as per usual. Unfortunately i can't leave until saturday because of track(fuck track!!). which gives me 5 hours of driving on saturday, and 5 more on sunday. I gotta say if it wasn't Maria's birthday i'd wait for a better weekend, but it's kinda important to me to hang with her, so i'll be able to do it. I might try nd catch up with kim as well, i dunno. I can't ever get in touch with her, so i worry that she just doesn't want anything to do with me. But i can't tell if im just being insecure or not. *shrug*   Anyway, I'm out like a fetus.  "There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but Cupid will NOT be defeated!!!!"
