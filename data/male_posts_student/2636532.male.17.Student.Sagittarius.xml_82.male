I put the link up on the left with all the other ones it's pretty decent, i mean it's no Happy Death but it's good. AND! for your information natty (had to say this, couldn't help it) i didn't complain about your blogs being to personal, i merely asked you if you really wanted them there where the people you mention in them could read them. it's not complaining when i do that, it's making you think it over. Jeez! but now i leave for i want to make me some bacon n' eggs. enjoy! -Matt
