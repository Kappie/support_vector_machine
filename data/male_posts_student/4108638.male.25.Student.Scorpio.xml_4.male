Basically that means I work for next to nothing. I think elephants at the circus make more then I do. I know I sound complainingish... but I really do love my work. Currently I am working with children and adolescents. Sometimes it really just means I play games with kids all day, but you would be suprised how much that can make them feel better about themselves or thier situation.   Soon I will be leaving E. Texas and moving to the big city of Dallas, which scares the crap out of me. I will be a real life serious adult. I want to leave E. Tx but I really dont want to leave the friends behind. More on this subject laters.
