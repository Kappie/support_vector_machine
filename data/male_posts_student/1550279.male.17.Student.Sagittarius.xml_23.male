It was a good guess if they had actually bothered to follow their schedule. The registration tables didn't even open up for another hour and 30 minutes, then we stood in Line #1 for about 40 minutes, got our nametage, then stood in Line #2 for about 30 minutes more. Note to CPL staff: A schedule is something you're supposed to follow, not just create and then conveniently forget.  I'm probably going back again on Saturday for at least part of the day (maybe not all, there's only so much I can actually do). Tommorow, I have  The Village  to go see, and I'll post my thoughts on that when I get home.
