This morning I had to wake up early so that we could get an early start on canoeing for Anandita's b-day celebration. Her birthday's on like the 14th, but no one was in town, including Anandita to celebrate it then, so we did it today. Anyway, we got up at like 8:00 and left the house at 8:50 (10 minutes late) to get their house by 9:00 so that we could drive up to Ipswitch (~45 minutes) to get there by around 10. It's all very precise, you see. Anyway, we went up and got all set up, and managed to squeeze 18 people into a 14 passenger van, set up the canoes and were in the water by 11. It took a couple hours to get used to the canoe because my dad and I had only gone once before and it was a while ago, probably about 3 or 4 years and even then we weren't very good.  Regardless, after an hour or two we were getting better, but it was almost unanimous that we traveled over 3 times as much distance as everyone else because while they went in a straight line, we zig-zagged across the river at almost 80 degree angles. My dad didn't know how to steer, but really wanted to learn, so I'd let him try, but whenever he'd try and i'd let him go, I'd either almost die from the blunt end of a fat tree branch hitting my face, or almost capsizing, or just run into a bed of those water flower things. It was all very fun and I am now sore.  They also had some hella mean/big bugs out there. One of them, I think it's called a deerfly bit a whole in my leg and it started bleeding and wouldn't stop for like half an hour, and it friggin' hurt too. Felt like someone used a wire-cutter on a tiny piece of skin on my calve. Owie. We were also the only boat to have flipped over entirely. We both managed to kill our cell phones, but hopefully they will dry out and be fine. We canoed from around 11AM to like 3:45PM, a very exhausting exercise.. All in all, a good time canoeing despite my dad's inability to steer, muscle soreness, and dead cell phones.  But the fun didn't end there. After canoeing we went to the beach, Crane's Beach and ate some lunch, got some tans, got sand in my shoes, and swam in the ocean. The weather has been really, absurdly nice out in Eastern Mass so the beach air wasn't too hot, the sand wasn't too hot, nor the water too cold. 5 of us went into the water and swam, talked about stuff (like american politics and how australians are wild adventurers), and I managed to lose my rubber bands for my braces. So... after this, we sung happy birthday and ate some cake and met an old friend from the Media Lab and left back for Cambridge.  When we got back to Cambridge to pick up our car, we (my dad and I, well, my dad) drove home and we took showers and tried to get the stuff from the beach and river out of our hair. It seems that the stuff in the river is pretty hardcore stuff that shampoo is too gentle to break up/clean out of one's hair. My dad tried scrubbing it out like three times and it still wouldn't come out so I suggested using the body wash, and guess what? It came out. Funny stuff, that river gunk; it turned my beige A baggy short things with lots of big pockets yellow.  After getting ourselves cleaned up, and listening to some music, we got ready to leave for Harvard Square. We found some parking shortly after we got there (a godsend, and anyone who's looked for parking in Cambridge knows this) and went to Finalé. Finalé's this dessert place that's really nice and highly sexy and tasty and glorious. We ran into our neighbor Sara and her family on the way and conversed with them briefly before continuing on our way.    This is the most interesting part to me   When we got there, we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table so we hung around inside the little place talking about various small random things like the relationship status of Sara (provided upon request. It's not like I just divulge this information for no reason. Jeez, gimme some credit here.) and I "flirted", as my dad's uncle and cousin would call it, with the girl who asked for our party name by complimenting her on her Brass Rat*. I only make reference to that because they hassled me once for complimenting this girl who was wearing this way-more-than-awesome pocket protector, I just couldn't resist.  Anyway, we sit down and he asks me what's on my mind so I tell him and he, being the really helpful dude he is. Yes, I call my dad "dude". I even call him dude in conversation, sometimes I'll be all like "hey, uh, dude, watch where you're goin'" or "Uh, hey, dude, can you get me that?" and he'll be totally cool about it. Getting back on track, he asks me how I was doing and I said that I was really confused about my life situation and I needed some help (Really, what else is dad for?... aside from the occasional 'loan').  So he asked me what exactly was up and I explained about how I have this fear of failure, and how I feel that I have to get into MIT or Harvard or CalTech or Stanford or Berkeley or any prestigious university of college, and how I hate having to worry about money to the extent that I do** and that I want to be financially independent of the rest of the family unit. So he asks me about detail and I say that I want to get a job because I need the money to buy things like music, bus fare, food, an electric guitar, an amp, things like that, but I feel that I can't get a job because every single thing that's been said to me says "It's a bad idea for your future to get a job in high school because it takes time away from other things you should be doing." Being the trusting dude (who also happens to be afraid of failure) I am, I decide to hardwire into my brain that it's a bad idea to get a job because it interferes with this bigger goal that you have of getting into a prestigious university because you're one of the best, so you deserve one of the best and if you don't go to one of the best, you're a waste. Now, my dad never said these things, but that's the impression that I got whenever I had talked to him before, so I had this very warped image of what the world and life were all about. Anyway, over the course of the night he convinces me that my world view is inaccurate and has been clouded by a life-long lack of resources, delusional mother (and trust me on this one, she is), and immature father (trust me on this one too, he was/is). And so in the end, he says something along the lines of the following, and I say it not because I think that it will apply to everyone, but I think that if you're confused about what you want to do, but feel pressured into doing something because you've invested time and energy into it, you might find this helpful. And if you want concrete stories about people who're like the ones described below, just AIM me at TheLordMeowMix and I'd be more than happy to tell a story or two (if I'm around. If not, just wait for a few hours... or more. You'll get a response by the end of the day for sure).  Ok, so he said something like this: Living life is about a negotiation*** with your situation in life and what you fundamentally need to live. It's not about following the path that's been laid out for you by others. That path is meant to be a safety net, and for my entire life I've used that safety net. There's nothing wrong with using the safety net depending on what you want from life. If you want to just follow the rules and go to work 9 to 5 and meet with your friends and do the bare minimum for a paycheck, maybe raise a family, that's perfectly fine. However, if you're not sure what you want to do, and your mind is always wondering and you're a curious individual who's into doing whatever is interesting not because other people say it's interesting, but because you think it's interesting and you're passionate, more power to you because, from my experience, that's the path to true happiness. Look around you, he said, siting examples of people I've known over the years who fit the latter description and how they're so happy with themselves and their lives. He said that they were happy, not because they follow the straight path, but because they didn't, again, not that the straight path is bad, but it's only to say that it's not the only way to go. They let their passions guide them and not some already determined path set out for them by their parents and society. And then he ended it on this note: Feanor, do what you want and you will be great as long as you go in full-heartedly. Don't play this game of life to beat others at their game, but rather to beat yourself at your own.  I dunno how interesting that is to anyone else or how that might even apply to anyone else's situation, but it really stayed with me so I figured I should post it. It has made me think and I feel better now because I think that my head's a whole lot clearer now. I'm probably gonna start laying out my skills for myself so that I can know where I can go and apply for a job or two.  I love my father, and that's not a word I throw around lightly for people****.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Class ring for MIT students  ** When I take the bus to work, it's hard to find the fucking buck-25 to use it not because we don't have change lying around, but because we don't have a fucking buck-25. Good lord.  *** Based on an analogy made by a swiss professor comparing the west coast to the east. She said "The way things on the east coast are laid out is a negotiation with the earth about where it's ok to do something, while on the west coast, it's much more like people just came in, tore it all down, poured concrete over it, and put nature where it wanted it." It's a very good analogy when you think about it.  **** I use it on other things, but very, very, rarely for people.
