     
      I've been writing since childhood. All those years ago, I would write stories, thoughts. Most of that writing is lost now. Lost between piles of old tomatoes and the beaten, battered Teddy bear that was once loved by a child. Now they sit there, my writing and the bear. Rotting. How I wish I had something I could offer them. I wish I could help them.
