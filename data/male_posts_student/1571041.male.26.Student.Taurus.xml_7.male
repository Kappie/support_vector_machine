But, it was a lot of watching videos that really struggled to hold anyone's attention, at all.  We watched a couple w/ some interest, but after a couple more, attention was turned to other areas, like sleep.  So many heads were nodding around, even the instructor's was struggling to keep an upright position.  But, all in all, it wasn't so bad.  I talked to the rez hogs and also trav from the lost tribe.  i'm trying to get them both to hook up for a show in about 3 or so weeks on the rez.  If things work out, it should be a nice show.  We'll see what happens there.  Then there was today, the 2nd day of saw classes where we actually get to down a tree.  Well, that was the initial plan anyways.  It didn't quite work out that way, but oh wells, it all pays the same.  About 10 or more people weren't able to cut a tree today, and that was fine w/ us.  But, we had lightening strikes all over the rez so we cut things off early and staged somewhere.  Well, before I get into that, let me mention that I got to talk to my cousin this past week that I've been working.  It just so happened he was taking the same classes.  That meant we got to catch up, and exchange some stories about what's been going on w/ us.  Today though, it was an all day event.  We mostly joked around, but also got into music, and wondering why people do some of the things they do?  It was just nice to be able to sit down w/ him and talk about anything and everything.  Okay, we staged after class.  It wasn't so bad, got to kick it w/ pumper folks.  These guls were really giving it the 3rd degree to ole gul on our crew.  I think she might have cried too?  Like it wasn't supposed to happen or something?  What's the old addage?  "What goes around, comes around."  That's what happened to her today.  She looks for confrontation, and got it in full swing today.  One white gul and one native gul put her in her spot.  Usually she's so quick to answer w/ something that either doesn't make sense, or has no truthful basis.  For these two though, she was literally speechless, which was actually surprising?  So, needless to say, she outcasted herself from everyone, trying to gain some type of response other than laughter.  That was staging mostly.  Then, we get called out on a fire.  Nothing really big, we know that, but we also know that no matter what, we're in for a hike.  I'm thinking, this is going to suck, swallow, and gargle.  I hate being right.  This was uphill, sidehill, a li'l downhill, then steep uphill.  Not only that, but it's for a small fire.  Yet, this fire has the potential of blowing up since it's been pretty hot and dry this past week.  It rained today, but I'm not sure it helped too much?  So we're going at this thing without a map.  We thought we got directions to this, but it was to the wrong spot.  So, we made a wrong turn, and was going in the wrong direction.  After we find out where to go, in kick the afterburners.  We're trying out excessive speed down a dirt road.  Not bad, except for the dips, ruts, and debris on the road.  If that wasn't bad enough, let's also throw in narrow.  The truck almost tips over, so I'm thinking, this is going to hurt, because we had 6 people in there, and I'm not necessarily the little guy of the bunch.  We didn't though, so that actually worked out in our favor.  Then we find out where we go, and have to hike to.  One hill done, I'm thinking the worst if over, but had to find out how wrong I really was.  We get there, do our thing and call it cool.  But, now we have to hike back down.  Let me add this for those reading, I hate going downhill.  I'd much rather we go uphill.  You don't turn, or roll your ankle going uphill, you do it downhill.  So, I manage the first ridge thingy or hill and have to keep my clumsy streak alive and fall at the bottom of it.  I was more mad that I had a whole hill that was pretty steep and difficult to fall on, but no, I'd rather do it at the bottom.  Then the sidehill comes and oh, let me just roll my ankle slightly and make this trip back to the truck interesting.  It hurt, but not enough to stop and doctor it up.  I was going right after that happened.  It was sundown by the time we got back to the rig, and I happen to notice the excessive sweat I managed to create on myself.  My entire front chest and stomache is drenched.  As is my back.  So, tomorrow, we're most likely looking at going back to that spot.  I know I'll hate it, I know I'll be sore, but I also know we gotta do it regardless.  So, I'm going to try out some sleep, pack some water, and hope I don't cramp up tonight, or tomorrow.
