I hate babysitting, it's for women, not for guys, we guys don't know how to watch kids and tell them what to do. Holy shit, the yankee game was amazing. Thank god for Aaron Boone or as the retarded comentator said, "Congradulations for Brett Boone!" Asshole. Today I hung out with Heaton. Today in school, in band lessons I got an A+ on some site reading shit when everyone else failed...amazing. I was shocked. Ms. Kalabza probably was impressed. Hopefully I make it to SYMPHONIC BAND!!! Anyways, I got Matrix Reloaded today in the mail, Heaton and I watched it. Heaton just left like 20 minutes ago. That's it basically, I was gonna go to the game but my dad didn't let me. OK bye.
