Today, I made about $100 doing that typing stuff, and I finally got my Gmail invite.  (But, I won't post the email address to it now.  I'm waiting until the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway to do that).  So, even though I was on the computer all day, I still had a relatively good day.  Better than normal, anyway.  Tomorrow is the big day.  I get to go pick up Spiderman 2 for my GameCube tomorrow, and it's going to be one of the best games I have ever played.  I know its going to be.  One thing that I've seen in the screenshots of the game (find one at the bottom of this post), is that it closely resembles Grand Theft Auto for the Playstation 2.  But, before I get off on nerdy stuff like I do at bagel.tech, I'll talk about other stuff.  By tonight, I will have already reached 20 posts on this blog alone.  Its hard to believe its been that many already.  I've typed over 11,000 words (before this one), and its only been 2 weeks since I signed up.  I guess you could say that I have nothing to do, but, oh well.  I'm really liking this whole blog thing, because it allows me to express what's going on in my life...if there was anything.  Well, I'm going to go watch this "Torque" thing that my brother's friend is letting me watch.  I never got around to watching too much of it yesterday.  So, until my next post later tonight, go do something to keep yourself occupied.
