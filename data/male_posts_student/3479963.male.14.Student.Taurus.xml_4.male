Although it was meant to be sad and depressing, I laughed to myself, how did 17 people commit suicide over this song. I mean~~ how depressing a song could get~~! LOl.. okok..   I had a terrible tuition this morning.. OMG I am a express student but i am losing out to those normal adcademic students. So depressing, That what ever topic the teacher taught us today, 'Mensuration' so 'quim', 'quim'= difficuit. That teacher explained rather clearly but i was still a little unsure about it. Maybe I didn't really paid attention, haizx... so stressful.. maybe i should quit tuition lol... BUt i seriously need it.. okok. tonight write somemore~~
