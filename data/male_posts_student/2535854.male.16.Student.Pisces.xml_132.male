Woke up at 11am which is now becoming a habit for these holidays or will soon be the past holidays..sigh...Didn`t do much today..wanted to go out but mom was sick and bla...and dad was busy sorting out his stuff in his study room..and as for me..my bloody wifi wasnt up during the daytime so I was sadly stuck with N64 and eating,walking around and what not..real sad..really upset...I got invited to see Troy by Rizal like 30mins before it started cause he bought 9 tickets and there was only like 8 of them..but couldn`t or actually didn`t want to cause Eu Git (CCL) Was there..ugh I don`t liek him very much...Rizal`s like he and CCL are the only 2 guys there..if you ask me..there are no guys there!:p ..sigh..Oh well...I would like to see it..not that I would really care if I didn`t..I don`t care much for movies now and never really have..maybe Star Wars is an exception...but other than that..I aint give a damn...everytime I wanna watch one..sure end up forgetting about it and praying Astro will show it again next month..sigh...  So yeah was extremely moody all day...then went to Starbucks....grabbed a Lemon Passion ice-shaken tea...not bad..quite nice..tried calling Mich but I she wasn`t home..guess she wasn`t back yet from Mid Valley..So well called Sarah..talked for half an hour..felt so much better!Wasn`t moody anymore :D love u hun!  ..Then left at like 7pm or so..also dropped by Guardian and got some stuff and got a whopper from BK for dinner...  Wifi came back at 10 pm or so...bathed..chatted and am here..my next entry will be right after this babes!  Riz.
