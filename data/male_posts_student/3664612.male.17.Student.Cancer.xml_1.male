Well ill tell you what I got. From me parents I got a MP3 player which is pretty cool, and from my sister I got a jacket. For the celebration my dad took us to dinner to a restaurant, instead most of my dad's workers/co-workers were there, so I had to sit in a table where im surrounded by people around 30+ years old. The only good thing about it was the food. The food was just great, and I had 2 desserts because I was the birthday boy, plus they sang happy birthday to me, sad very sad. In a good way though.  Well England lost in the quarter-final. Im so ticked off right now. England should have won that game, reason is because they were leading until the 83rd minute. And the keeper James is a fucking bad keeper. He missed one of the easiest goals in the tournament. Another thing which pissed me off was the goal that was disallowed because the ref thought it was a foul. If you see the replay of that goal, it was obvious that John Terry did not foul the keeper. It is because John Terry was going for the header first and Sol Campbell came up from behind and pushed John Terry down to get to the header. Thus John Terry, did not do that on propose and it was no intentional. Making the fucking ref wrong! Argh......  Well, as my friend said its no used crying over spilled milk. Now the 2nd quarter-final game Greece against France is that my prediction that Greece will beat France in one of the biggest upset in the tournament. These are the teams I believe will make the semi's besides Portugal. Greece, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. Im tired so ill end it here, yawn
