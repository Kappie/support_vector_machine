I really don't have much of an excuse, seeing as I spend about 4 to 5 hours a day on the internet...let's be honest, on Imperian. My gaming life has eclipsed my geek life, as paradoxical as that is. I simply spend too much time on geeky activities, and not enough time blogging  about  them.  On a similar note, if anyone is in the Dallas area, every 1st Saturday of the month I run a Rifts campaign at Lone Star Comics, the local geek conservatory. Dice will roll, mega-damage will flow like milk and honey, and post-apocalyptic roleplaying will fill impressionable young minds (as well as a few corrupted older ones.)  Squirrel  More to come...maybe
