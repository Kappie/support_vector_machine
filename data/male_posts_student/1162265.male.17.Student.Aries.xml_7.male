I seriously thought about that in Math today, and was like, if their is a snow day or if their isn't I'm going to be happy, because whatever happens was meant to happen, so I should go along with it..... man.  I guess it's kind of strange.  The only thing that could possibly stress me is being wrong, and even then I'm getting used to it.  I guess a person always needs to be slightly stressed and have something eating at their soul, but what's eating at my soul right now isn't that big.    School was pretty funny today.  Mat seriously made me get sick to the stomach from laughing in Algebra today.  Besides all the things he said to Mr. V, he was rapping, it was so funny. He was like "My name is Matt, I represent the white nation.  My skin may be light but I'm hung like a Haitian!" that alone still has me going.  Well, whatever.  I have work to get done, and the burning in my soul is really eating away at me right now.
