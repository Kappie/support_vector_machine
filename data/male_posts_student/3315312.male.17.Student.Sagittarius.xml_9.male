Apprehending him was probably impossible...We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq...There was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."-  A World Transformed  by George H.W. Bush  Q: How about you, Dick?  A: "If you're going to go in and try to topple Saddam Hussein, you have to go to Baghdad. Once you've got Baghdad, it's not clear what you do with it. It's not clear what kind of government you would put in place of the one that's currently there now. Is it going to be a Shia regime, a Sunni regime or a Kurdish regime? Or one that tilts toward the Baathists, or one that tilts toward the Islamic fundamentalists? How much credibility is that government going to have if it's set up by the United States military when it's there? How long does the United States military have to stay to protect the people that sign on for that government, and what happens to it once we leave?...I think to have American military forces engaged in a civil war inside Iraq would fit the definition of quagmire, and we have absolutely no desire to get bogged down in that fashion."- Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense, April 1991   Anyone remember the Powell Doctrine? As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell proposed six questions to be answered before committing American troops to combat. The doctrine was used quite frequently against Bill Clinton in the '90s and is in existence to prevent another Vietnam. It goes like this...  1.) Is a vital US interest at stake? 2.) Will we commit sufficient resources to win? 3.) Are our objectives clearly defined? 4.) Will we sustain the commitment? 5.) Is there a reasonable expectation that the public and Congress will support the operation? 6.) Have we exhausted our other options?  Q: Hey, Colin, you seem like an intelligent leader. What are your thoughts?  A: My doctrine was created to avoid "halfhearted warfare for half-baked reasons that the American people could not understand or support." "We must not...send military forces into a crisis with an unclear mission they cannot accomplish- such as we did when we sent the U.S. Marines into Lebanon in 1983. We inserted those proud warriors into the middle of a five-faction civil war complete with terrorists, hostage-takers, and a dozen spies in every camp, and said, 'Gentlemen, be a buffer.' The results were 241 Marines and Navy personnel killed and a U.S. withdrawal."- Colin Powell, in his speech entitled: "US Forces: The Challenges Ahead," given in 1991.   "The impending war in Iraq, however, arguably meets only one criterion of the Powell Doctrine. Weapons inspectors have just begun their work, which is why France, Russia, and China argue that war is not yet a last resort. Public support for a war in Iraq is hardly strong. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, while a majority of Americans support the use of force as an option, 59 percent want to give the United Nations and weapons inspectors more time. The divided opinion reflects the lack of a well-defined national interest in going to war now. The Bush administration has tried to portray a pre-emptive war as essential to the war on terrorism, but the evidence of the 'links' between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda is highly questionable."- Ruth Rosen, San Francisco Chronicle columnist. Written before the invasion.   Don't take hindsight for granted!
