Here is an account of one the dreams I had tonight and an analysis of this dream concurs so well with my notions about dream interpretation.    First lemme narrate the dream and then detail its interpretation    Tonite at about 2:30 I was working on my thesis code and I was very hungry. In two days I had eaten nothing substantial. I don't know why, but just din't feel like eating. I was waiting on my monstrous lung model to render. I thought it might take 15 mins before I see anything at all on the screen so set my alarm to cry in another half-an-hour    ............................  ...........................    I find myself in the Computer Science dept walking to the grad lab, when I was about to enter the lab, I look over my shoulder and see a streak of light on the floor in front of my advisor's closed room. Its late in the night and he is still working hmm!! thats strange I say to myself. I find three other people in the lab, the guy next to me sounds familiar and next to him a fat lady is working on the computer. The guy next to me fixes to leave and I look at him and to my horror his lips are dark and appear burnt. To add to my shock he tells me he will give me a ride back home. I try to reach for my shoes under the table (no idea why I removed them) I find a totally misfit footwear of mine underneath the table then I turn back and I see that the fat lady in the room has a scarred face (part of forehead, eyes, nose and lips appear burnt). I frantically slide my feet inside those awkward shoes and then I' am on the run I seem to have a pillow and a sleeping bag in my hands.     I run frantically in the hallway of the CIS dept and when I reach the end of the hallway and take a turn I find a few CIS students (one particular gang I usually find in the dept labs) skating on the shining floor (all the lights are glowing in this side of the hallway) and at the far end of the hallway I see people sitting and eating it looks like a chat joint (I see some coke crates, plates in different color and a colorful water pot) and my fear recedes on that sight and then to one guy who is standing around I ask the whereabouts of my frnd PR. He tells me that PR is trying to flirt with a konkani girl (Goa's language is konkani) in the stall. I see in the direction in which that guy points and see a good looking Indian female clad in red sari, shes tall, shes got a lean and tall bindi that stands out. She looks like shes very tired and I search for PR he is not to be seen around........    ......................  ......................    I suddenly realize that this is a dream and I'am feeling really hungry so I fix something to eat. While munching I retrospect the dream I had and I head towards my computer to blurt out my first post in rave and thus this blog was christened RAVE. I will follow up this post with my interpretations of this strange dream.    Murali.
