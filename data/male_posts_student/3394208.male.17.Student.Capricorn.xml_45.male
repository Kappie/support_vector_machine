I say take me down down down... Tell me why is it that you leak Baby, baby I'm at my peak...  Wondering about when you will come Baby baby don't you tell me your already done I'm knocking, I'm knocking once again But baby you left your done with nothing to say Could you be interested in my evergrowing heat To tell you baby I'm at my sexual peak Won't ya stop if you done go low Don't ya shutter what i got for you  Take me down down down... I say take me down down down... Tell me why is it that you leak Baby, baby I'm at my peak...  Oh baby what I did do to you Have always been the dreams of my crew Oh baby what I did do to you Have always been the dreams of my crew
