Wild Magic - I just finished reading...). Unfortunately, the quartets are all related to each other...  therefore ... i just spoiled the first quartet for myself... fun. Why didn't anyone tell me?? Ah well... *cancels all Immortal holds and places ones on Song of Lionness* excellent..done. Hopefully, they come in the right order..^^;;   Ah... skating was good today, the usual skating around in circles, and talking.   Sat school was pretty interesting too.. we had to split the class into two, and i went with the group that stuck with the assistant teacher. The assistant teacher was nice and let us do whatever. I practised self-defence with some people from my home school...^^;; got thrown to the ground a few times...eh...heh...ah, well, it was fun. Breaktime was fun too, ne?   ah, that's bout all...happy whatever-that's-coming-up-let's-just-say-international-night.   ~Chronos
