I feel sorry for that little fire hydrant all alone out side in the cold. I bet he misses my trunk. yeah...he probably does. anyway, this weekend was probably better then my whole spring break. lol white castle. lol those drinks were really old. lol 3 hours of sleep. lol good times. damnit i'm really geting sick of the phrase lol. it seriously needs to die, thus i shall stop using it for good. maybe i'll just use ha ha ha or something stupid and pointless like that.
