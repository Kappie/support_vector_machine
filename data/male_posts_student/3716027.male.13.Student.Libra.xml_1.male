We got there, and then canoed and set up camp but the site  SUCKED  it was a hill, and the only level spot big enough for out 4 person tent, was where the firepit was, and you couldn't move the firepit! So it was a pretty bad site, but it was waterside.........  At one point we canoed to an islad, that was near the middle of the lake, we saw storm clouds, we called the dog, and hoped in the canoe and headed back, and had about a half-hour until the storm hit, The storm hung around for awhile, and then decided to leave just after dinner!! Amazingly the fire was still going, so we babied it up, and cooked marshmellows. That night it rained some more, then this moring, while we had to pack up,.. Guess what!?!?!  It rained some MORE  So, we packed up in the rain, though we had a tarp, so that ment that we didn't get very wet, most suff we could do under the tarp, exept for a few things,  bringing everything to the car probably a 1/4 mile away or so, and packing up the tent. Those were the jobs that everyone did, but  there was one more job, the second worst out of all four total "misery jobs", this was the canoeing in the rain, back to where we put the canoe in, a ways away, through an open lake... I was one of the two stuck with this job, needless to say I was very wet, but not as wet as my parents who were stuck puting the Canoe on out car ouch! that's wet!  Anyway, I'm glad to be back and  urlLink  Elvorix   is lucky that he's on a cruise not camping!
