Less than 5 hours to go and I'm just starting to feel that it's actually real lol :D   Finished packing ages ago and I've only just realised I forgot to pack my toothbrush SHOCK HORROR! I'm gonna keep a Mini-Journal on the plane so I can get you a good detailed description of what it's like, and I'm hoping to get a few pics from out of the window :) The first plane goes to Atlanta, where we will be boarding another flight to San Antonio, our final destination in Texas. It's gonna be a great journey! The last time I went on a plane was when I was about 4 and I can only remember a bit from that.   This is going to be my last post until I take out my Harddrive from my pc to take on holiday with me (Yes, I'm going to be online!)   Anyways, goodnight :D
