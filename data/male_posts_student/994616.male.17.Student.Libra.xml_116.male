However I thought I would write my own Christmas list, to indulge my more self absorbed (inverted mirror ball) tendancies.    1.  The one thing i want more than anything? My own pet  Colin Farrell    2.  The pretty good, but not quite as good as number 1 thing?  John Hobby    Yeah, I think that's all
