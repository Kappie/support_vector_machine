Boomingly,  his voice carried through the white tiled floor of the narrow crawl-space that people travel daily towards the vending machine room.  After all,  work chit -chat is rampant in the work places of corperate america.  The whole idea of two pot-bellied, tie wearing, middle-management goons hanging out by the water cooler seems to me like those fuck heads have some sort of daily ocean fantasy.  They must always stare into the water, like they are looking for fish.   "It's fucking WATER! Are you looking for a fucking dead body! DRINK IT!"   Sounds like the guys, down the hall, are talking about fishing. . .
