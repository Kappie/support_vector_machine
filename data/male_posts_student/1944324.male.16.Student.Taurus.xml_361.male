I'd like to start off by saying that this post is a completely new post on a completely different day and with Marten, Thomas and Nathan out of town, it may seem like I'm posting a lot and if you're offended by this...well...bite me. The juniors (in Inter-disc) at LN have created a board to discuss...stuff. School, Current Events, Homework and other things. It's a really good idea, and now, for the first time ever, I present to you  urlLink THE LC INTER-DISC/AP BOARD ! Or LCIDAPB! No actually that's a really sucky acronym. But I really, really need your help. Tell everyone who's going to be in either Inter-Disc English/US History or AP English/US History to come here and debate and chat and stuff. By the way, Marten and Thomas are my official mods. Sophia, by virtue of being a girl gets to be a girl. No wait, Sophia gets to be the other admin.  The Great Work Begins...  The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?! (- Someone needs to change that...)
