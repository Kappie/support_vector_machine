The rest seem to fade with time, flitter away into the darkness, like moths to the flame they swarmed, ready to die, ready to be eaten and spit out by the eternal hell that is forgotteness.  The first... I remember what I was wearing, I remember what she was wearing. I remember how cold it was outside the car. I remember almost every word that was said. I remember how special I felt, how warm she was. I remember the first contact. I remember the taste. I remember the smell. I remember my friends. I remember the problems. I remember a good friend. I don't want to anymore. I want it all to go away. It is the one string that is unable to break...it is what holds the quilt of my thoughts together. I must remove this one string. When it leaps from the flames, it brings an unstoppable army of memories, rampaging in my mind. They are uncontrollable. They sweep over my mind like an ocean of pain and misery, with every memory comes another blast of insignifigance. They make me feel dead, like I am unworthy of Human eyes. I curse my hands, eyes, and lips. I try to scar them, try to change who I am and what they are to me. Only reminders of a time not so long ago that will never be again. My life hasn't been the same since. It may never be the same. All I can do is try, and if my will is not great enough, then clearly the gods must want me to suffer through this inner turmoil, and I was not meant to forget for sum reason, sum....purpose that my weak mind cannot grasp. There are many things that my mind cannor grasp anymore. It is losing it's grip on reality. I slowly but surely sink lower and lower into insanity. Not the insanity that you read about, the insanity inside everyone of us. The longing for chaos, it swallows me now. It wants me to embrace it, I say no, it pulls harder. You MUST it screams at me, but i can't. I must hold onto the one last thing that keeps me alive, that keeps me going. Whenever I feel as if it no longer has it's grasp on me, it reminds me that it will ALWAYS have a tight grasp around my mind.  Spense
