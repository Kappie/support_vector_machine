God will not let down on people who have faith. u just need to wait for tat day to come. ur fate is in ur hand........n ur decision will decide how u are in the future......so u must make a good decision as it might affect ur whole life.....i have known her since....f5, she was carefree (maybe she is not, im not sure cos she only tell me her problems these few month) and now.......hmm.......she is still the regina i knew but...........more matured n thinking too much.......n i did pray for her.....hope she can solve her family problems and find a really good bf to take good care of her as she has been taking k of others for a very long time, guess it is her chance to be taken care of. okok, i'll stop, too much nonsense................. ;)
