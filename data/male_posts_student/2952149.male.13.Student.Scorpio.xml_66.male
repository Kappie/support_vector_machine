Even though I haven't posted in a while I really have nothing to talk about lol. I am learning to play "Slither" by Velvet Revolver....I really like that band and especially that song. You gotta love Guns n' Roses lol. I have probably purchased like 10 CD's since I last wrote in my blog......Slipknot,Velvet Revolver, Best of Guns n' Roses, and some others. I talked to Stacey yesterday to get her address because her B-day is comin up so I knew where to send like a card or something. I spent the night at Chad's house the other night and we had tacos for dinner and we both put a whole shit load of tobasco sauce on them and...yeah...it wasn't too fun lol. Great pain inside my mouth...lets just say that. Well thats all that I can remember to talk about so hopefully my internet at home will be working soon or else I will just have to come back to this G-d damn library place.
