Before that though, it was about 3 days of classes about pumps and chainsaws [read previous post].  so, I work  11 days straight  to get  one  day off.  I took full advantage of that day off.  I didn't really plan on it, but what the heck, " road trip ."  I head over to yak rez to see my cousin for the first time in like a month.  Pretty good considering at times it was about  once a year  at times.  Turns out he had his 2nd kid the day before I get there.  Not only that, but as I'm pulling up, he just shows up a couple minutes before me.  Uncanny timing on my part I guess?  It was somewhat odd how I walk in the house, he sees me and nonchalantly says,  "Check this out."   I was expecting a new drawing or something, but li'l did I know he was gathering my attention to the newly born gul on the pillow next to her mom.  It was crazy seeing that, and him being all parental about her.  But, we get to talk for a couple minutes, and then I got to go handle some business elsewhere.  I told him I'd be back, but little did I know it was going to be hooouuuuurrrrrrsssss later.  More on this post after I get back from work today...
