The real Free india will come into being only when the Left is silenced. Hell with the Left! Left is the prime reason for what India is today. The Leftist Idealogy didnt let Nehru perform and the same "Idealogy" is ruining India even nou. In the name of equity they are wasting Tax-payers money in Govt.Monoliths. I wonder when they will come down to earth and understand the reality.
