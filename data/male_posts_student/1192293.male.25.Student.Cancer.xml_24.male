There were two opening acts, the first of which I cannot remember the name of, since I only saw them perform two songs.  No worries, they were crappy rap-rock anyway.  The second band was  urlLink Planes Mistaken For Stars , a great band out of Peoria Il. They put out a great set while simultaniously being drunk off of their asses.  They sound kind of like a really pissed off  urlLink Burning Airlines .  Then Motörhead came out, promised to kick our asses, and delivered.  My ears are still ringing two days later. Definately one of the most violent mosh pits I have ever encountered.  If you have the means, I highly reccomend going to one of their shows, but bring earplugs if you want to be able to hear anything at any point during the rest of say, your life.
