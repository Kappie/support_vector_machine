In fact, I don't even know if its a headache, I just say it is because I know no other way to describe it. Even two weeks after the incident I've still been having the dreams. The images of the event haunt my sleep. It's hard to even gather the energy to go back to work anymore. At least...to go back to that place.   I never thought something like that could ever happen. It's a fusion reactor, not a nuclear bomb. Ten seconds of time has turned into weeks. I fear it may be getting worse. My colleagues insist I get medical attention, but I know better. No doctors can help me now. I fear what may come ahead, for something of this magnitude has never occured before...or ever will again.
