He is a nice looking handsome chap and also talks good things about terrorism and economy although he is a lawyer. While he was delivering his speech, there was name of Dick Cheney. I was wondering all the time   "Who is this Dick?".   After that I came to know that he is the present vice president. I wish I have heard name earlier.
