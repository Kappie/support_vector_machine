A few days ago, I was talking to some of my ffriends and all of a sudden, some jerk came up to me and said" hey kid, didn't you hear? wrestling is fake!!!!!" so I'm about to go all out on this guy. But I controled my temper and asked him if he had ever actually even taken a bump. Naturally he said no. so I asked him what compelled him to say that wrestling was fake if he had no experience in the wrestling world. I don't claim to know whether it's fake or not, but at least I don't claim something I don't know for sure. I just get so angry thinking that anyone would claim something that is really uncertain to them.
