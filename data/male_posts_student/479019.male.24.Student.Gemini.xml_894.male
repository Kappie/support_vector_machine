I think zombies are making a comeback... with movies like Resident Evil and 28 Days Later.   After the movie I got thoroughly buzzed / drunk at the Ale House. Lots of intellectual rambling along with cheese and crackers.  Today I managed to get 3 pages of writing done and mailed some stuff.  Coffee is brewing...  ***
