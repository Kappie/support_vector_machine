The only low point was this guy who came on and claimed who was going to do "We Got Trouble Right Here in River City" style song and then spouted mindless dribble for around 15 minutes. No singing involved. Anywho Nathan and Alice and all the others were really good. Everyone go to Pajama Game Sunday  [I think we're going Sunday-Marten]   [No, we're going Saturday.--Michael]   No Michael, I am going Sunday then because I am busy Saturday, so Marten should come then. On Saturday, come to the World's Biggest Game of Musical Chairs, which requires 8,500 people, on Saturday and the Lawrence Park football field place. To get in free, bring your own chairs! Michael come to the musical chairs Saturday -Why shake hands when we can shake...other things?
