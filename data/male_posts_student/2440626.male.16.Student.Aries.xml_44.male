You know there's only one of me and 6.022*10^23 of you (Johann Hyonkerburgherhh).  Today Messiah Coney replaced my batteries--and we talked a  real  conversation.  I told Mrs. Ostrosky about Pi Day this Friday--the same day we were supposed to have the Chapter 11 test--and I asked when if the test was for sure going to be Friday.  She said, "Not anymore... it's Thursday."  Yeah.  Maybe I'll write again sometime soon.  Au revoir.
