However recently he has been getting flirty with me and this other girl. It is no longer happening between me and this guy, but this guy is DEEPLY in love with this other girl, even though he hates himself for it, and he only likes his girlfriend as just that. A friend. I think its blatantly obvious what should happen between him and the affair-girl, but she has a boyfriend, and the guy doubts that if he broke up with his girlfriend she would break up with her boyfriend. Its all big and lame.  I don't want it to be the holidays.
