The weather today was a vast improvement on yesterday, being sunny and not too hot. We had decided to take zhou xun to a park to play, so us three hopped into a taxi across the city.  The park was small but clean and had a large playground. We paid the 5 yuan (33p) entrance fee and went in. Zhou xun being 5 years old and full of energy, bounced, climbed, slid and ran around for a couple of hours.  For lunch, we had planned to treat him to a pizza hut meal which he'd never had before. However, he was adamant that he wanted kfc. So, it was off again in a taxi to the nearest kfc.  I have to say that for a 5 year old, he has an impressive appetite; he ate more than did! The kfc is very similar to the uk, but about a third of the price. I found the meat was darker and flavoured slightly of lemon, i guess to cater for the chinese taste.  After lunch, we wandered around some shops (at last finding some shaving gel, i can look almost respectable again!). Having zhou xun with us meant buying sweets, a bug's life video and playing some arcade games.  After the shopping we came back to the apartment to let zhou xun sleep a while. He had other plans however, and we ended up watching a bug's life together until yuqi's parents came home.  For dinner today, among other things, we had some new pancakes i hadn't tasted before. They were very large, about a foot square. We filled them with pork, onion, corriander and lettuce. The pork was in a really nice black bean sauce and the whole thing was rolled up to be eaten. Very nice indeed.  We're relaxing now zhou xun's gone home, tv says temperature is gonna be 36 tomorrow!  Interesting china fact #11 - in a lot of shops, you can see a small figure of a fat golden cat waving. The chinese believe it is a good omen, to bring prosperity.
