It kind of bring back memories when I first got saved, due to the friendship of a brother and somehow or someway, I really came to God despite my previous prejudices about Christianity. God really uses people to reach out to us. =)  Hmmm... for those of you who have been reading my blog, you probably did not notice some changes to the poem that I had put up. This is due to the scrutiny of a friend who majored in literature and poems in her JC.... ahahhahaa.... well... but it seem to sound better. Anyway, I just discovered today that this good friend's brother is actually in the cg of the recipient of the poem when I was sending her back after the conference. Hahahhaa.... can see the incredulous looks on the face of my regular car khaki when I said I need to go somewhere else today... hehehe... actually, it was more of an excuse to send someone back... =p Well, gotta think of new excuses next week again....
