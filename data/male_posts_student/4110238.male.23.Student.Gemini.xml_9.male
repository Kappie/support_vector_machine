It was much needed--maybe now I'm caught up on my sleep.  This evening, I went to  urlLink Shakespeare at Winedale  to see  The Tempest  with Laura, Jamie, Lena, and Lena's friend (whose name I can't remember, nor could I spell it if I did).  First of all, let's not kid ourselves...Winedale is a beautiful place.  The drive out took about an hour and a half, and parts of it were rural Texas at its best, including a few very charming little towns ( urlLink example : Round Top, pop. 77).  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Then there was the play itself, which is an incredible meditation on forgiveness, redemption, power, fantasy, reality, illusion, and theater.  It is, in other words, a typical Shakespearean play.  Since this one is thought to be his last, however, it always seems to resonate with deeper meanings: is Prospero a kind of double, a stand in for the playwright himself?  What does it mean, then, when he says of Caliban, "this thing of darkness I acknowledge mine?"  And what does it mean when Caliban says, "You taught me language, and my profit on't is I know how to curse!"  The actors were terrific too, especially Prospero, Caliban, and Ariel.  Those are probably the parts in which it is easiest to shine, but all three of the actors portraying the roles seem to have grown considerably since the last time I saw them, in Chekov's  The Cherry Orchard .  Anyhow, all in all it was a very enjoyable way to spend an evening; I'm only sorry I didn't also make it out so see  Macbeth --another of my favorite plays being performed this season.
