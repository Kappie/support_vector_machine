Any comments can be sent my way at my aol address (killacal13@aol.com)....  Without further....  Okay, I promise this won’t turn into too much of a confessional. I cannot have the entire AUC knowing all of my business. It’s just that with this day approaching I have a lot of emotions ready to come out, and hey, writing is a great way to deal with it. Besides there are a lot of people out there that agree with me.   It’s just that this day coming up, you know the day when you spread love and what not and shower that special someone with gifts and what not, well, it sucks! No really, it’s for the birds.   Now you are probably reading this and saying this guy has some unresolved issues, and you would be right. Let me try to bring you to speed.   At one point in my life, my cubbie hole was full of Valentines. Every girl in the class would send me one, sometimes it seemed as if they were competing to impress me the most. The rumor got out that I liked Root Beer Dum Dum pops and all of a sudden each note would have a sucker attached for this sucker here. Then, around the time when I got glasses and it was apparent I was going to be skinny and smart and not much else for a while, the cards stopped.   I’ll spare you the gruesome details, but somewhere down the line I went astray. I perpetually have no woman at Valentine’s Day. Maybe I spend too much of my time chasing the wrong ones. Who knows? Bottom line is that I am unattached as are many, many, many other guys and girls out there.   Enough about me though, I’m straying from the point. Why do I hate Valentine’s Day? Well, it’s simple. It’s for men and women that have someone. It’s the same reason I wouldn’t like Christmas if I were Jewish. Who wants to see what seems to be the entire free world, getting lovey dovey, kissing and what not?   But just like Christmas, Valentines Day makes stores, from Parisian to Target, tons of cash. Like it or not Valentine’s Day is here to stay. Guys get tricked into spending tons of hard earned money yet another day out of the year, and for what? Okay don’t answer that, it was a dumb question.   Then again, maybe I’m being a hater (won’t be the first time). Maybe one day I will spend the day with someone I care about and learn to see it as a great day. Maybe one day pigs will sprout wings and learn to fly away from the butchers. Until one of the two happens I will continue to hate this day when public displays of affection are allowed. I officially am the Grinch who stole Valentines Day. Lovebirds beware.
