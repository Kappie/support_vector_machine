I Have Plans To Watch TRL @ 4, Work On Getting The Laundry Done, And Cleaning Silver's Cage.... After That, Its Back To Doing Nothing! I Think I Will Go And Clean Silver's Cage Know! Oh And BTW, It Feels HOT Today, It Is Only 91 (91 Is Hot, But Better Then 100), But It Feels Like It Is 100 Or So, To Hot For Me!
