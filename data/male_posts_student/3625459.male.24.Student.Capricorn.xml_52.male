Things that will get done by the end of next week   1: Hand in my resignation on Sunday.  2: Pay up my rent by monday  3: Buy tickets by wednesday  4: Wrap up this project by the 8th   Mama i'm coming home , home, home ! ( Do i wanna go home or am i just running away)   I'm at a stage where nothin matters anymore. I guess i'm back to my usual self again. this time around with a heart burn. Ironice isn;t it how one person can make so much of a difference in your life ( is it a choice am i letting myself to beleive this. canthese feelings change if i choose not to?)    So many things to do    So many ppl to meet    So many lives to touch    Nothing matters ,    Coz i feelalone without you    Been trying to get hold of my supervisor , he's never there. Blah. My life, sometimes i wonder if things will ever change.   The chat room's been empty too, none of the regs are there. Guess thats the end of my hangout joint.
