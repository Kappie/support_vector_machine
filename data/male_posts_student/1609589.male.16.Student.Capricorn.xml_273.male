The day started at about 1:30 when Nicholas and I loaded our stuff into me dad's truck, headed over to Dustin's house, and loaded his guitars and amp.  Once we got there, it was... 2:30 I believe, and eeeverybody got a chance to carry *my* stuff. Just kidding, they volunteered, otherwise I would have had no problem making 18 billion + trips.  What'd I bring...  Drumbone Drumset Drumstick(s) Dulcimer (the D instrument, as some of you have been calling it) Miscellanious Drum Shit Marshmallows/Jello mix we got from Tom Thumb (Dustin said he could turn gelatin into pudding, but he never proved it XD) Backpack full of stuff we never used (like my 80+ Frisbees(Yes nicholas, AOL Cds)) CDs and fun stuff  Once we got there, I loaded all my stuff into the COA room, then brought the instruments into the Sanctuary, where we hooked up and started jamming.  AJ and I needed to practice drumbone, but we needed a 3rd blue man. We didn't practice for a while, because this annoying chick named Jerica (who was a friend of this really annoying chick named Jenny) volunteered, and AJ and I decided outright that she would be our absolute last choice, and we wanted Sarah to show up so we could make her win by default somehow.  So, AJ and I just started practicing the first part, and a mixture of Dustin and Erik volunteered to be our replacement blue man until we decided.  Dustin picked up the guitar part to drumbone really quickly, we made him watch the Drumbone scene on the DVD about 5 times, while I stayed in the sanctuary and played dulcimer for a while. I found out how to play Above on it, and spent the rest of the night perfecting the notes and the technique.  Sarah: "Did you teach yourself that?" Me: "Yep. ::keeps playing really fast::" Sarah: "You're amazing." Me: /grin "Thanks X-P"  ^^yup, I've found out how to do X-P in real life. It's just really subtle.  Okay... what'd we do next. Blue Man Auditions.  Didn't work out as well as I'd planned- we just tried out whoever was in the room. Grant got pissed at me for getting pissed at Zach and Nicholas when they were fucking around in the sound room.  I'm fucking scared of Grant, one of our "advisors." He's always giving me this look like "Who the hell are you?" and pounds me into submission when I can't find the answer to that question.  We had "checkin," which lasted fucking 2 hours because noone would be the quiet and let anybody else talk. Apparentally they had scheduled everything pretty much already. That was good. We had mediocre pizza from Cici's, which I didn't really eat much of because I wasn't hungry.  We got free reign of the sanctuary, meaning we had access to the sound system, and we could basically do whatever we wanted as long as we didn't break anything.  We started yelling "CHARLEY MURPHY!!!1" over the speakers really loud, and stuff like "I'm god!" "And I'm his unlawful son, Zeek!"  We got good at drumbone, then we decided it was time to break for a while, because my hands were hurtin and Dustin's fingers were hurtin. AJ and Eric- no wait, it was Sarah at this point, AND eric, wanted to go watch movies.  Watched Tears of the Sun and Donnie Darko at first. Me, AJ and Sarah were the movie buddies, pissing everybody else off because we wouldn't get the hell over laughing and watching the movie.  Tears of the Sun, I didn't understand much of it- Bruce Willis kills his entire troup (and many of his brain cells) to save the french chick from the matrix and christian black people in Nigeria. Of course, the US had to go in and stop the dirty fucking non-christians from stopping our missionaries' fun. Made the whole movie pointless to me.  Donnie Darko- I saw it first at movie night, and it was amazing. I've watched it about 3 billion and 5 times since then, and i was barely able to sit through the whole thing. I'm not to the point where I can recite all the lines (that part of my brain is devoted to relearning Rock Concert Movement number 237 after forgetting it), and I'm not sure if i WANT to get to that point.  It did get bothersome that Nicholas whispered everything Frank the Rabbit said, but I got over it.  The movie is amazing, but it really doesn't pertain to my life in any way, which is probably the reason why I can't watch it religiously every day like some people can. I believe a lot of things about the movie, but one thing stands out the most- Nicholas takes it VERY seriously, and debates it as casually and as often as I listen to Blue Man Group.  We went through the church service right in the middle of doing another practice on Drumbone. We have this whole sketch planned out, it's awesome. Dustin comes out, picks up the guitar, and starts playing this really hokey tune. At certain points in the song, the blue men come out one by one, from a different position. We originally had them: In a closet, hiding behind the handicap walkway up to the stage, and from behind the big wall with last-minute supplied near it.  I think though, that we should change them, because they're kind of bad places to be. I'm thinking more of- come out through the kitchen, the library, then still in the middle wall.  I was originally going to be drumming, but since AJ was having problems switching the notes at the end, I'm doing the end sliding parts. I can play every single part besides guitar, and do fancy stuff with it, but since cloning myself is out of the question, I'm working with everyone to make this the best experience possible.  It also means I have to dance.  I'm gonna try out some improv things on saturday(our dress rehearsal)- I want to walk in the audience and walk towards someone as if I'm gonna do something (while Dustin is still playing that tune on his guitar), and then AJ is going to segway into drumbone(which is really well done- no stop between Dustin's song and the first drumbone note), and I'm gonna act surprised and turn around, and all that good stuff. Then we do drumbone, pull the pipes, blah blah blah, the rest of the service, boring boring boring, speech speech, offertory, happy funtime song at the end (Gary Jules- Mad World), and then we'll probably come out for some sort of meet  greet.  The blue men are probably going to be sitting like children in the conversation with children, where someone tries to make these little 6 year olds learn about philosophy and why the little bird flew away in some sad, sad story they read every week.  We're having a guy do an impersonation of George Dubya. His dad can do Bush Sr, so we only found it appropriate.  Afterwards... some of us headed to the kitchen, while others went out to the playground. Sarah, AJ, Meaghan and I sat in the hall talking about this-or-that, and Sarah was cold, so she wanted me to come outside with her to her car, probably because the christian monster from a couple miles down the highway patrols the Horizon parking lot at night.  Eric made jokes- "Jesse, don't let her rape you- she'll get you while you aren't looking!" and I thought about saying "Yeah, I'm just afraid of what would happen if i DIDN'T go," but I didn't say it. Heh, I'm always thinking of saying stuff, but I never do.  I followed the "gang" around for a bit, and then everybody started playing hide and seek, which I didn't want to do because I was gonna end up breaking something (blind H), and because I had a bad headache (worse than normal, but not as bad as when Nicholas hit me in the head with the fucking guard pole X-P)  I fell asleep on the table behind Sarah, who ended up moving to the floor, and when I woke up, everybody was out and about on the playground again, and since we had moved all the instruments out of the Sanctuary, I went in and started playing Dulcimer some more.  I didn't think of sitting in a couch in the other room, because only Alan was sleeping in there and I didn't figure we were gonna go in there. Fucking bad decision on my part. I hear a huge rumble of people, and when i get there, all the couches are taken, and they're putting Dogma in the PS2. I got the shittiest seat, this uncomfortable beanbag on the floor that you couldn't lie down in, and didn't get to sit next to my movie buddies (and in turn be able to sleep).  Half way through the movies. Laura moved from the seat next to Dustin, so I took the oppurtunity to jump into her seat and sleep there the rest of the movie. I awoke to Salma Hayek saying "You did SO well" and i got pissed off because that was the part I'd seen most.  I got up, then some other people got up and started tossing the ball around, and since we got up on our own, Alan made sleeping people get up and take our garbage out :-P  I played dulcimer outside in the windy weather, which sucked because I was afraid it was gonna fall over, so i went back inside.  They had the car wash, so I'd keep going up to dustin and tell him what a horrible, horrible job he was doing ("CAR WASH" sign holder-upper) and that he failed. Heh.  Everybody left the "party" besides me, Cheryl, and Zach, the latter two fell asleep on the couches. I couldn't bring myself to stay still for some reason though, so I kept walking between rooms. It was leftover easter weekend, so all the little kids were getting all the leftover chocolate eggs they had there for some reason.  I'm running out of things to say, but I don't feel like I'm done typing yet.  Let's see, what else has happened...  I have one week to get my costume, dye gloves, and give AJ all the drum stuff he needs to practice. If only Sarah and AJ lived closer, we could go around and get stuff together, so we know exactly what we're doing.  Also, everybody has some predujice against sending e-mails on the friggin youth service e-mail list, so we're not getting any work done.   I've made my decision. I'm going to stop typing now. The Youth Service will be awesome, or I will kill it. Yes, I will kill the inatomate activity in which our group is participating.  I also apologize to all the non-church people (Irving people) who didn't understand what the fuck is going on- I tried to make it entertaining enough for anybody to read, but anywho, I congratulate you for reading this far.  I'm going to bed, it's 11:20 now, I will not be able to get up tomato morning. Good night :)  P.S. Special shoutouts to Sarah for volunteering to be a blue man. I've told you before, but you rock, and this thing will be awesome. :-D
