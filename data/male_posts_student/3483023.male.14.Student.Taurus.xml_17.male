They Finally Got The Sprinklers Working At The Apartment We Currently Live In, And They Fired Them Up To, But I Didn't Go Play In The Water Though...I Would Feel Like A 2 Year Old. I Noticed Quidus On TRL Got A Hair Cut, He Looks Like A Dog, I Found That To Be Kinda Funny! I Really Don't Have Much To Talk About Today, Not Much Going On In My Life.... Sorry =( She's Innocent I Tell You, INNOCENT!
