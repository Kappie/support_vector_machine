Basically I ended up puking around a half a gallon of vomit, and then lost so many electrolytes and fluids that i was unable to stand or walk...i had to lay down on the floor cause so much fluid was being extracted from my blood i could not even get on a couch or bed.  I ended up drinking some Peptolyte, and almost in 10 minutes I felt much better, but still not close to healthy.  At times before I took the peptolyte, when i attempted to get up I almost blacked out and I thought I was going to die.  It was fun.  It seems like if I take decent care of myself and eat the right thiongs, I should be better by monday or tuesday, and able to do things. I won't be doing anything on easter so I don't risk it.  Other then that the Wings are on today, so I will get some reast and watch that later.
