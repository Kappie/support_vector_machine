That is cool - anyone want an arcade game to go in the casa. CHEAP! I would just wait for another auction. I think there is one coming up on June 22nd. Look out for that. haha. I will probably go home after work, roll a J and play some fucking gta3. I have yet to actually fuck off for a few hours. Keeping the apartment clean is an all day job by its self.
