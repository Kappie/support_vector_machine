He glanced at his wristwatch instead. 6:00. Early. Too early. However, it was more fitting than noon to the severe     ged feeling he had, induced by a rude awakening in the still unholy hours.   And so Sam laid in bed, waiting for sleep to return. And if sleep wasn't an option, perhaps he was just waiting for a decent hour to present himself to the world outside of his bedroom.   They say that time flies when you're having fun, so the reverse must be true for boredom. Each minute felt like at  least  15. So as Sam stared at the ceiling,  then became uncomfortable, shifted position, and stared at other various object in his room, he thought of friends, of the summer, and how it was already going by so quickly. Then he thought of how his thoughts sounded a lot like something in a bad movie... or a soap opera... or a bad movie based on a soap opera...   He glanced at his watch again. 6:01. My God, this was going to be a long morning. He closed his eyes and drifted into a restless sleep that lasted until he woke up again--at 6:05. What a way to wake up.
