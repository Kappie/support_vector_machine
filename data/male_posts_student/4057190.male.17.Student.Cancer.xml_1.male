Well Not really, one of my best friends,  urlLink  Miriam  , hooked me up at a McDonalds right here in Manhatan. I'm worried because I really dont want to be a Cashier because of the fact that I gotta be handling w/ the stores money and I dont wanna be blamed for having missing money, when I already know that the Manager actually steals from it!!   Im expected to go to work for my first day tomorrow and I hope that I do great!  Wish me luck people!   Jay Jay
