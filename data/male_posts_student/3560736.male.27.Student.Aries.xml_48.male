We may be able to create extremely powerful computers, we may even be able to very cleverly simulate intelligence, but we will never actually create a machine that will be able to be intelligent in the way a human is: creative, sensitive and utterly unique.  I doubt very seriously that we'll even be able to create a computer that could show the same intelligence level of a dog.  Macines will always be nothing but a series of commands entered by a programer. Chess computers are a good example of what I'm talking about. They are very good at what they do, and they are very powerful. However, essentially they are still a product of millions of lines of code entered very carefully that does nothing but analyze every possible outcome of a chess game. They also program in every possible strategy to every possible counter move - they basically program in every effective chess move possible. There is no creativity. You can't program the computer to simply understand the rulesof chess and then say "go get 'em!" You can't even program it with general guidelines for strategy - well, you can, but anyone with a rudimentary understanding of chess will be able to beat that computer.   Basically, the computer is able to simulate intelligence in a highly specific domain (chess) but only within the prameters that the programmers have accounted for. That is the limitation, the computer cannot create, it can only extrapolate and analyze based on previously entered data and parameters. It simply has more knowledge to pull from than a human opponent and therefore has the ability to beat that human. Now see if it can readily apply, on it's own, the concepts learned in chess and apply them to, say, Risk (a vastly simpler game).   It is an opinion for sure, but experts have been saying we're "10 or 15" years away from artificial intelligence since the 1970's, and they're still saying the same thing. You can bank on it. It will never happen.
