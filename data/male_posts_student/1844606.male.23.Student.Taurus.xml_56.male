Even better, its completely fictional, in the fact that the characters are not based on anyone I know (myself included).  I did use Lake Forest/Bluff as the setting.  So deduct creativity points because I'm in love with those cities.  Or at least my memories of those cities.  I really like the story, first time in about a year I was excited about the ending of it.  Some may find it sappy, but I think it's senitmental in a sweet way.  I also blame this on seeing "Say Anything" on Bravo last night.  I watched with a bitch on my lap, wish it was a girl...  The weekend was pretty good.  Gorged myself on Carson's ribs and pork chops Fri. Paid the price Sat.  Didn't leave the house, in fact barely left the couch.  Had a dog by my side almost all day.  Watched ESPN Classic footage of vintage Jordan. Got confused by all the new numbers for channels.  Wound up watching the OC Marithon with my Mom, making sarcastic comments all the way along.  Watched "One Fine Day" WHY??????  Saw the Yankees lose, took a small amount of joy in that fact.  Switched the clocks, woke up, watched the Bears got on a bus.  Wrote for 3 hours.  Had Domino's cheese steak pizza.  Wrote for another 5 hours.  Read the Monk, listened to Sabbath.  Ah.   Rest is coming.  There's something about fall that makes me want to be close to someone thiiiis much more.  Halloween is coming up.  I don't have a costume.  But I think I'll shave my head and groin and glue in appropriate hair where it doesn't belong.  Won't that be a convo starter.    Party goer, very scared, in a quivery voice: What are you supposed to be? ME: No idea.  If you want this new story I did, let me know, I'll electronically inundate you with pretentious self loathing.  Signing off kids....  PS I already miss my dogs
