What little I can remember of him was the "running tabs" he kept for my friends when they came over for dinner or spent the night.  He would alwyas tease them about paying their bills before they left.  He was a fun man, I think I got a lot of my humor from him.  I look a lot like him through most of my photos.  When I look at photos I can definitly see a lot of him in me.  My favorite images of him in my head are all of him smiling or laughing... he had a huge smile, and probably as big of a laugh... maybe that's where I got mine from.  He was a great dad, played with me, tickled me, loved me, laughed with me, made fun of my mom and I for crying at a happy or sad movie.  He was an amazing man from all accounts that I've heard.  I don't think anyone who met him didn't like him.  I mean who wouldn't?  He was my dad.
