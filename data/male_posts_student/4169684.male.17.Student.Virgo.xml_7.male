With life fucking you from behind Taking away from you, your very innocence You realize that all life is, is time  Time spent at home Time spent alone Time spent wondering what you've done Time spent thinking And time spent drinking Time you spent making the past undone  Yet soon you come to realize that life is unfair As it reaps upon the benefits of your misfortunes Unjustly taken, while you are left to mourn As life takes a look and laughs to see your heart has been torn
