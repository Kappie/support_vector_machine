Along with spoofs of like any Disney animated movie ever? Tis all in Shrek 2 - a great sequel. I just saw it tonight! From the movie (roughly) - when Pinocchio needed to lie so his nose would lenghten: Shrek: Lie! Donkey: Just lie! Others: Lie, Pinocchio! Pinocchio: What should I say? Donkey: Just say you're wearing ladies underwear! Donkey: I'm wearing ladies underwear!! (nose does not grow any bigger)
