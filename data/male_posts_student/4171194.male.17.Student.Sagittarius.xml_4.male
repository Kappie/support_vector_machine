He screamed.  “What’s wrong Neo?” The she-male Trinity caressed her hand, which had hairy palms by the way, over Neo’s face.  In the darkness of Neo’s mind, he realised that he must have been pretty wasted the night before to have found Trinity even remotely sexy, I mean, honestly. He screamed again for good measure. Then he ran, not bothering with that slow-motion bollocks.  As he ran, Trinity fell into tears. To the cabin, she proclaimed her sadness. “Why? Why does he always run off screaming in the morning when at night he screams in passion as I do that thing with my ____? ( insert your own sick fetish in the space provided )” More tears, boo fucking ho. -----  Minutes later, Neo had already forgotten what had happened, and was eating cereal outside, fruity loops in fact ( ooo, foreshadowing ). As he robotically separated the red rings from the green rings, the guy with the bald head, and who held no real role after the first Matrix, came in.  “Neo, the Oracle wishes to see you.”  “…”  “Neo?”  “…”  “Neo, is there something wrong?” Morpheus looked at Neo, examining him.  Neo screamed ( this makes a total of three screams so far! ).  “Neo! What’s wrong?!”  “This fucking spoon won’t bend!” DRUM ROLL PLEASE. -----  Behold the magnificence of the lazy writer and his use of Deus ex Machina.  Neo took a seat on a green bench in the park.  He was immediately hit by five pieces of bird shit, and not even he could dodge those suckers.  A moment later, the Oracle came hobbling over, with her sex slave Seraph.  “Neo, how are you?”  Neo stopped cleaning the bird shit off of his gay arse trench coat. “I am… fine… You?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  “… How do I know the answer to that which is not under my control?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  “… How can I find the answer to knowing that which is not under my control which in turn I must know to find out how you are?”  “Only you know the answer to that.”  Neo attacked the Oracle, effectively killing the old bitch, which was paid so little in the movie she quit so the Wachowski Brothers were forced to use the one line she did record repeatedly. Don’t you just wish that happened in the movie?  The Seraph cried tears of joy. “Thank you Neo, she made me do horrible things…” He shivered. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget the sight of her hairy ____ ( Insert body part here ) or her saggy breasts…”  Neo killed Seraph with a single blow. Those mental images would never be erased from his mind.  Then Smith came and Neo killed him too, thereby cutting off any reason to make another sequel and also saving his own life.  He then proceeded to fuck Smith's dead body for no good reason.  ( See? Those fruit loops did make sense after all ) ----   9 out of 10 Sane Men Agree This Matrix Fan-Fic is the Fan-Fic to Be
