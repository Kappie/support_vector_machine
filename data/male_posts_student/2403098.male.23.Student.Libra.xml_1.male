I'm sitting here in the computer room and just heard my dad say "Ya'll need to get that blood up before it stains."  HMMMMM, what has been GOING ON out there while I was sleeping until nearly 2pm?  Probably one of our many animals ran into something.  It's a really nice day, I think I'll.. sit around.   BYE
