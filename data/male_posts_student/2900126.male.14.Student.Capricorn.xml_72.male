Some people say they "scar" themselves*physically* because it's the only pain they can control, it makes the pain go away, or it calms them and there are many other reasons.    If it's the only pain you can control wouldn't you want there to be no more pain than you already have in your life? If so, then why would you add more pain on top of what you already have?    If it calms you, wouldn't it make you more tense because you have to deal with try not to hit any veins or arteries that are vital to your survival? Why can't you find an alternate way to calm yourself other than hurting yourself in a self-destructing manner?    How does it make the pain go away if it hurts you and you have to deal with the scars that you leave behind? And how does it make the pain go away if you are causing other people pain?    Emotional-destruction~    Why do some parents bring their children down and make them feel like dirt if they truly and honestly love them? Why do they say the things they do if it makes their child cry or become depressed and leads to "other things"?    Mental Destruction~    Why do some people make themselves believe that they can't do something when they know that they are perfectly capable of doing it? Why do some people do things and then they allow them to become habits that may be hard to break?       All questions that would like an answer but don't necessarily need one. But yeah chichi's coming home in like less than a week! YAY! although I don't know what LinZ is coming back I hoe she has a nice time in NY. Yeah people don't fret about going back to school because it's natural and if you don't do it you never know what your future might have been without it.
