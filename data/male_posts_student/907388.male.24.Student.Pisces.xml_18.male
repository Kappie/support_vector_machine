That's my village... yes... there is only one cyber cafe here.. dialup with bsnl connexion... but pretty fast... although they charge 30 bucks an hour.. but no discs.. I did have to disc so that somebody could make a call.... they share the same phone line... so i can live...  so things here are festive... in fact it's so festive that you find it hard to believe that it's all because somebody has died... representations from all branches of the family... no point in reeling out the names... today is the day of the real feast... expecting aroud 2000 ppl to be here ... there are lots of ppl working none of whom i really know...but all of them seem to know me... it's wierd...  last night i wanted to buy some mineral water... the water here being clayey.. and white in color... i could not get a bottle larger than 1 lit... nobody here could even think that ppl could buy water...  strange land !!! Will put my next update asap.... Take Care
