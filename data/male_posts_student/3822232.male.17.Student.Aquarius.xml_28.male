TESTED and PROVEN by Lai Yi Feng of HCJC.. so.. ya.. dont think i want to do tt again.. it's just.. cant get me anywhere further than CEO. haix..  again, jia you ba.. really have to be serious abt academic stuff le.. so.. i am going to shift my main focus to academic.. after all, the words from the scholarship officer reminded me this. she said we are here to study, not to do well in competitions and cca.. main priority shall go to studies.. so.. yea..  okie.. upon realising tt i have to do extremely WELL for my promos, i think i shld get back to work le.. seeya tmr, niteZ diary and niuZ =)
