The concept of Alan Rickman as Snape has delighted me to no end, as did his role of the Voice Of God in Dogma.  I'd love to see what it'd be like if Sean Connery played Dumbledore, though.  And I also thank the powers that be every night that my friend Kaitlin isn't the director. Although I really have nothing against yaoi, it is not my cup of tea.  Anyway, I've lost my train of thought, so enough about that.      I've decided to delay my review of The Day After Tomorrow, it should be up before Monday, though, so be sure to check it out.  Also, I've decided to imitate a friend of mine and list my current mood and what song I'm listening to at the time of each post.    And I've decided to get rid of the Quote Of The Week, and just post a random quote with every post.  It's easier on me that way.  Oh, and SubliMinal messages are OK by mE. (Laugh if you get it, think about if you don't get it)  Random Quote!  "Doens't it strike you as mildly ironic that most of the women against abortion are women you'd never fuck in the first place? -George Carlin.   Edit:  Goddamn my typing skills.  I've had to go back and change no more than nineteen typos.  Shit, I need to spellcheck more often.  Fuuuck
