But what wasn't was that my mom couldn't pick me up(stupid traffic), so I got a ride from a friend, and I came home to a seemingly-empty house. So, I beat on the door hopefully, and no one came. So, I stand there looking like a combonation idiot/wanna-be robber for 10 minutes, and then my 'brilliant' brother comes to the door. Evidently, he thoght I was already inside! How can anyone pound on the  outside  of the door when they're  inside?  Over-all, a bad, bad day, in more ways than one....Stupid traffic
