Introduced and made interested into this online program, I decided that it would help  alot towards tightening my slackening grasp of the English Language(well maybe a bit).   Confession #1 There is this evil that resides in every human being, whereby behind their facade of well meaning, there is this avarice in them, not to unrelentingly top their coffers but to gather greater fame and publicity. These deeds are often done unconsciously and causes others to be intimidated. I, undeniably am one of these people, and I feel remorseful for not being able to escape from this detestable characteristic.   Confession #2 I am an Atheist. I do not really believe in God. I feel religion is just a recourse for people to turn to in times of adversity. Of  course I will respect their cultures and ways.  But, there is one paradox that intrigues me, and that is that of the scientific truth and the few pages of the Bible.The christian Bible tells us of the world being created in seven days and man coming into the world almost immediately after it was created. Whereas the scientists and researchers and discovered that man was created only 65 millions years after the dinosaurs once rampaged the Earth and millions more of years when the Earth of created. Which is more credible? I do not know. Many things have occurred paradoxically, the researchers might be wrong. The Bible was written by someone anonymous to me and he could have folded the facts to create a fantastical story of his own, there is always a possiblity. One more thing would be what I learned in unravelling the sciences- Babies resulted from incestuous relationships have been proven to have a high chance of deformity, if Adam and Eve's  offspring were to reproduce, and so one, wouldnt this world know be a place of abnormality?  These are just some of the queries I have about the validity of the revelations recorded in the Bible, not a means to inveigh against Christianity and to never to be an attempt to indoctrinate     a different set of ideas in them.  I have been very open about my beliefs and hope they do not culminate into uneasy tensions. These may be treated as immatured and sceptical, but I would wish that these doubts of mine be clarified.
