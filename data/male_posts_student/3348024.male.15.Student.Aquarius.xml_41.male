On the way out I noticed these two strange children holding hands and skipping towards the door.  As they approached the door I realized that they weren't holding hands, skipping, nor were they by any means children.  They were old.  The guy looked like he was a Gangsta back in the day though so I figured I should hold the door for an older brotha... So I lingered holding the door for the old man who had the appearance of being in his twenties, possibly fresh out of high school.  He gave me a strange look, so I was thinking, "uh yeah, fuck you too."  Then as he walked past me, I realized that, like the jackass that I am, I was holding the fucking exit door open for him.  I was like, "Hey, buddy that was a joke.  Ya know? like Ha Ha, He He style."  Then I busted out the oldman laugh (thanks for that one molemonkey) and fell on the ground laughing like an old man who fell off his rocker while tripping.
