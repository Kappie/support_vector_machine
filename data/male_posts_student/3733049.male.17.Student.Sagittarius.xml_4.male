It happened on Father's Day when my father started into another one of his 50(or was it 60?) stories that he often repeats over and over throughout the years. We were on the West Side Highway in pursuit of my grandfather's house in Staten Island when his incessant rambling came to a halt and then... a lull of silence. He did then something that I have not experienced since I was young...amaze me with a brilliant story from his days growing up in New York.   He began talking to me about how he and a group of friends had a cable access show called "Present Nostalgia" that aired in Manhattan. From what he told me, the idea was bounced around for awhile during a poker game the group was having. They believed they could do some sort of rag-tag sketch show just for fun and laughs. Other people were doing lame shit, so why couldn't they do something they would find entertaining? Getting a show would be free as long as they proposed the idea to the network. Believe it or not, it worked! Granted that cable access is totally free and everyone is open to start their own show, the mere thought of a group of friends screwing around on television, even if the audience was limited, is an extraordinary concept and probably the coolest thing I have ever heard.   My dad recalls that the name was created to mimick the oxymoronic principle in the name of legendary rock band, Led Zeppelin.( For those who need an explanation: a Zeppelin is a blimp much to the fashion of the tragic Hindenburg and the irony of a Led or Lead Zeppelin is that it would then be too heavy to float, it is a contradicting object in the imagination. As with Led Zeppelin, Nostalgia is a longing for the past. It is impossible for something to be present if it is in the past. If it sounds like Im talking down to you in this anecdote that means I am.)   Anyway, from what I prodded out of my dad, the show was compiled of various weird segments that seemed like a precursor to the Howard Stern Show. The most memorable skit was one guy dressed as a woman and was offered on the show as a date. My father described this guy as the most pathetic cross-dresser New York has ever seen(believe me, there are a lot of bad cross dressers in New York), yet people called. They must have either been really blind or really horny to call in. Sad, just sad.   As one of the MC's, my father did a segment where it was a magic trick. They would take a live caller and my father would pick out a card, put it up to the camera facing away from himself, and then put it away in the deck. My father would then guess the card shown to the audience. So far, this seems like a lame trick thats been done over and over again. But here's the twister, one of his friend's off camera was practically screaming out the card to him on air. The humor was that the stupid caller was completely baffled and astonished on air while everyone else even remotely paying attention could have figured it out how and from where my dad was getting the answer.   Like all good things, "Present Nostalgia" was cancelled. The production crew got pissed after a skit where someone got pied in the face and some cream got on the microphone. On request that they pay for the microphone the group, including my father, proceeded to curse out the production crew and leave. P and N was, sadly, finished after just two shows.   Hence, in tribute to my father for being young, crazy, bold, and adventurous I have named my blog after a brief period of time whereI knowhe was just like me.    ON FURTHER NOTE: I have a picture he gave me showing two figures: the other host of P and N dressed in a Present Nostalgia t-shirt with a Richard Nixon mask on giving the president's famous two-handed peace sign. My father is wearing a mask making him look like an 80 year-old geezer wearing blue jeans, white and black Pumas, and a tuxedo with black bow-tie. Is that fashion or what?
