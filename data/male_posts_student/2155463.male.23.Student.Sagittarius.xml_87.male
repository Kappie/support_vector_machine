As much as I might try to tell myself I need to have a good attitude about that class, I just plain hate it; languages just ain't my thing :P  And being in class for TWO hours every day doesn't make anything much easier...  Anyway, today went really well.  I made it through Spanish (that's probably the best that it gets), then headed home and changed into my "spiffy" clothes (i.e. suit, tie, etc.) for my interview up in Cleveland.  I actually made it up there in about 40 minutes, and I don't think that the traffic is going to be bad for when I come in during the day (of course, getting home around 5:00 could be another matter).  I met with Tom Martin, the head of the appeals division; my dad had introduced me to him a couple of months ago and we'd been playing phone-tag, so it was good to finally meet him :P  We went back and had a brief meeting where he went over what I would probably be doing (I'm basically going to be a glorified go-fer, but I have a funny feeling I'm going to end up doing a lot more than that), and I was introduced to a couple of the people in the office.  Then I tagged along with one of the women while she dropped off a couple of papers at the appeals division and prosecutor's office (I really should remember her name!), then I got the low-down on parking, etc.  I have to admit, it was really good to be back in the public defender's atmosphere again.  I don't know quite what it is about it, but I just really feel comfortable being around people who are in trouble like that now; maybe because I think that I kinda know how to help them.  But I have to say that I noticed the differences between Cleveland and DC even while I was sitting in the waiting room, especially in the racial makeup of the clients (there's actually some white clients!).    I actually already got my first assignment with them today (aside from knowing that I'll probably be delivering and picking up documents every day).  I find this hilariously funny, but one of the attorneys at PDS (Washington) had a witness for a case who works in the Lorain Correctional Facility, so he/she asked the CPD (Cleveland) to serve the subpoena.  Guess what?  Yep, they were going to serve the subpoena tomorrow, so Tom said that since I have experience with serving PDS subpoenas already, why don't I serve it?  (Actually, I have to say that serving subpoenas was one of the funner things we did in DC, although it was always more fun when it was a hostile witness, and this guy is not).  We also had our playoff volleyball games tonight.  I couldn't believe how well we played!  We played the same team that crushed us in our first three games, and you could really see how far we'd come.  We destroyed them in the first game, then we barely dropped the second one when we hit a dry spell and just couldn't hit the ball straight.  The last game was pretty competitive and we had some awesome points, so we really felt good about things (especially since we pulled it off and won the match!) :)  Now we have another playoff game next Wednesday (8:00), and we might even make it to the championship if we win that one (considering we came in sixth out of seven teams, this is big news!).
