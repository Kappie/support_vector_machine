A few days after the day spent with  Nigel , I met up with  MchWng , an old friend who incidentally is only free on school holidays even though she is working. And that’s when she’s not rehearsing for a new play. We don’t meet very often, sometimes once every 4 or 5 months.  I have to say that I was quite presently surprised when I saw her. First of all it was actually daytime and I didn’t know how “new” it made things seem.. usually we only meet for dinner and we were actually debating when was the last time we had met up and seen the sun.  Next, she was dressed more…casual than I’m used to seeing her in since she didn’t come down from school. It was a nice change.  We sat down for some waffles, chatted and later went for a walk down past the riverside. Apart from a call from  FeFe  asking questions as he was sitting opposite us during the waffles that threw me off, I had quite a nice time just hanging out. Truth to be told, its been a long time since I had an outing of this sort. However I do find myself somewhat more uneasy being around  MchWng  than before. I guess, it’s because we’ve known each other for almost 5 years and she has seen me in my bad times and my even worse times. She’s sorta like by  Aunt Agony . But I told myself sometime back that I shouldn’t just treat her as just that. As I have always taken issue with others taking my friendship and me for granted, I shouldn’t do the same to her. And since how that both our situations have changed recently, it’s like starting anew again. I guess that’s not so bad, but only if I get myself out of this funk and start treating her like everybody else and not as my  psychiatrist . I mean I don’t treat  FeFe  as my lawyer or  DaMan  as my doctor.   Perhaps we should break the 3-4 months per meeting routine…
