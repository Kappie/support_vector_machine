It is my view that the number one thing  that is wrong with people regarding politics, Iraq, and so on today is that they are wholly uninformed and wholly misinformed.  Most people who attempt to argue the war or the upcoming election DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  The crux of their arguments lie in the fac that they do not like Bush.  You ask them why don't you like Bush?  9 times out of 10 they call him arrogant or too much of a cowboy.  They can't argue any policy matters because usually they don't know too much about it.  They just don't like him, and that is not enough to have a civil discourse about.
