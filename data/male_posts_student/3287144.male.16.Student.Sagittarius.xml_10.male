I also watched two hours worth of TV programs with Dan Cruickshank in, very sad I know but has anyone stopped to look at the coat he so often wears? Its rather wonderful in its own way but I don't know why. Today my friend read an article that had been written about her but as if she had written it after she had an interview with one of the journalists. The writer managed to infer that she was spoilt. Well said it to be precise which has my friend aggravated beyond measure as it looks as if she is admitting to it. Which she should. Just joking.
