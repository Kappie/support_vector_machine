Took the A maths test today, haha, i did the 1st question, and left the 2,3,4,5 BLANK, lol i think i'll get maximum 10 marks...i'm going to drop A maths yeah. Anyho, todays chemistry lesson was quite okay, at least i understood a little bit of the alien language she was speaking...at least. hmm. O hell, i cant wait till i get michelles letter, valueable info inside hmm? I'm not feeling that bad about the Os now...don't know why but it feels good to be like this...mood swings maybe. I skipped CLB today, and i don't think any of the students went too...hah, this saturday at st.pats...Nooo! Gauddamnit i have to reach there at 9am. AM. That means i'll have to wake up early on a bloody saturday MORNING. Funny, i have the mood to write today, wonder why. Yeah and i met up with Jeremy and Ridz at Mac siglap today whilst on the way to buy my hair spray. Ate and Chit-chatted, the usual, walked home, taking the short cut by climbing over the fence at this estate with i cant seem to remember the name. Oh...theres Daniel calling me to MU, gtg, bye. Feeling like shit now, sadsadsad. Thinking of a part of the Motleycrue song... : When I had you, I had everything, now all I have is this photograph....
