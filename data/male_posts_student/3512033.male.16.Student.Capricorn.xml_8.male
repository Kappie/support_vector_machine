(i'm turning japanese, oh yes i'm turning japanese, i really think so...)  watching anime, listening to asian music, (btw Fly away is a sik song... dont ask me who sings it but...)  anyhoo, my mate wants me to piss off his computer (not on)... stupid tightassed bitch... but i gess i can do an extra long one next time so you people can enjoy my adventures as normal... just dont read this one until i say so, ok...  dammit, why dont u ever listen? now you've ruined it for everybody... :P  well anyway... c u again... unless you don't come back, and then i probably won't...  but either way... i shutup now...
