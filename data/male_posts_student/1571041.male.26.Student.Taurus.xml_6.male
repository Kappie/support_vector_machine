I will say this though, my cd collection has bounced back w/ a vengeance and the dvds are looking lovely.  By looking lovely, I mean that the collection has some nice #'s to be counted.  Well, to say the least, I owe someone a promise that I will buy  some   clothes  for myself instead of investing  so much  financial  irresponsibility    into  cd's  and  dvd's  like I have been doing since having this ole job @ Mt. Tolman.  Well, I also offered other things, but that's between that person and myself.  But anyways, I'm here on the rez, and things got complicated with  some people .  I don't know what's going on, but more than likely things are looking like they're soured,  for now .  That sucks, but so is life and I'll have to make due w/ what's thrown my way, even if I'm  not really agreeing  w/ the scenarios at hand.  I don't know why I brought that up?  Shoot, it's been a whole 5 months now since I've even touched this li'l blog thing!  I was thinking that I should scrap this thing, but it's nice to look back on past thoughts, and see if they still held true, or just got lost in the wind.  I don't really know how things held up, but know that in those 5 months a lot has happened to me as a person, not so much events.  I'm more looking forward to getting this school stuff started up again and I can just go for what I want to go for.  I've been here @ the rez, and things just didn't work out to really benefit my plans for the future.  It's been an experience where I'm that much more focused though.  Anyways, we're doing more W.U.I. work lately, got done burning piles in snow, and prescribed burns on the rez.  Looks like we're going to get laid off sometime soon, so it's a matter of weeks until we get our last day on for the year.  Well, I'm not knowing where things go from here, but until then, I'll leave it at that...
