I guess I always want to be one of the very first to do something, but I don't want to take a risk with something that may fail, so I back out of being the first. Like being the first to get a job or get a license or listen to a band... or get a blog.  well today is just like every other day... wasting my time at the computer, listening to the same mix of songs. I made scrambled eggs this morning/midday for breakfast. This was the fourth time in the past week I made them. The eggs taste really good; I put hash browns in them. I'm so proud of myself for cooking good food. :)  I am not passionate about anything... why? I want to  love  something... like piano or guitar or running or surfing or working-- something ! I've been at home for 2 weeks straight and haven't even had the will to clean my room. I guess you can only find yourself and your true passions when you do something you don't really like. Or when you're with other people. Just TRY something. You'll be surprized how much of an experience you can have doing something mundane.
