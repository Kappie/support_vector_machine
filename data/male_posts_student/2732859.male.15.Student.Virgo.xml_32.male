The first thing that is wrong is that the Government cannot stop a terror attack.  It has been almost 3 years since 9/11 and by the election it will be more than that.  What have they been doing for the last 3 years?  Aren't they supposed to be protecting us from attacks.  I believe that it is in the Constitution.  The Preamble of the Constitution states that the government is formed in part to "provide for the common defense..."  Republicans are supposed to be the party of law and order and national security and defense party.  Now they are basically saying that they have no idea what is going on.  My second problem is that we would be giving into the terrorists that we are fighting.  During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said that if they delayed or otherwise interfered with the Presidential Election of 1864, that it would give the rebellion a victory.  Not even in the midst of a civil war was the election altered, except in areas where there was fighting going on.  We are supposed to be fighting for freedom and democracy in this war against terrorism, and by postponing the election we would show that we are weak and that the terrorists have found a way to hinder the democratic process.  I don't think that we would be able to make fun of the French anymore about being weak on terror, it would be us that is weak.  The Spanish didn't change their election a few days after the Madrid train attacks on 3/11, the governing party went on with the elections as planned and lost the election.
