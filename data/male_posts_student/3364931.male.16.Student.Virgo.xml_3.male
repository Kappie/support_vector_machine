Wow the spells are awesome and so was Hogwarts... Rowling is an awesome storyteller and i hope she comes out more stories. That reminds me that i HAVE to get the 4th book....something about the phoenix or something like that....since i have the Kinokuniya vouchers ! erm...Kino really have many books....shelves and shelves and rows and rows of books...from witchcraft to something like "the horoscope bastards:you guide to finding the bastards in the horoscpoes!" to Jap mags and interior designing...hmm...i could spend the whole bloody day ! sadly....i only spent one hour and it was closing time last night...so...i didnt use the voucher.hmmm...will go agin tomorrow...  Speaking of which... i have my rehab tomorrow at CGH @ 2.40pm...hmmm.wonder if physiotherapy is painful...i hope its nothing serious...my feet is getting worse each day...the doc said something about the inflammation of the muscles due to the over-usuage of the leg....din know that could happen....so on monday i ran two times around Bedok reservior, which was a grand total of 9.6 KM.the furthest i have ever ran in my entire life...which brought about the bloody pain in my leg...and so im limping everytime i walk. On top of that i still ran on sunday for the J-train training...wow...thinking back huh, i think i deserve the pain on my leg ! So now i have to recuperate and not do any excercise for some days...what a life...oh well...you cant have everything going the way you want anyway...still living, so to live is to challenge oneself !  Had a great dialogue with Ming Wei, Colin and my new-friend-but-it-seemed-like-i-have-known-her-for-a-lifetime Rowena at Starbucks...we talked from 8.30 all the way to 11.30pm ! but i felt so encouraged and set targets for myself immediately that night....and did some encouragements and articles for my classmates who had problems until 4am and went to school at 8...but i felt happy that i could help them out with their problems. okay...something like that....peace out.
