I'm not sure why, but that's kinda normal... sorry to say.  ~ Well, we copied notes during Commerce class today again. Then, all the students from K classes were asked to go down to attend the Basic Economics Seminar with Mr. Karthikeyan. He's a really friendly and nice person. He gave us a lot of tips. As usual, Ee Vonn (Miss Tidur) slept again during the seminar. Haha...   Nothing much happened during classes for the rest of the day. But something is going to happen to the Form 5 prefects! We're in trouble again! And to make things worse, there's a problem in Boys' Brigade too! I'm in deep shit right now. I'm shattered!  * Can't help fallin in love... *
