Woke up at 12pm, went to Shaw to "study" from 1pm to 5pm and then going home to sleep till 8pm and started watching tv. Lol. Don't seem to be studying for tomorrow's exams. ^^  Feeling down now... Suddenly, i've got the feeling to go to poly instead of staying in JC. I kinda feel that JC life doesn't suit me. It's somehow stressful and to me, it ain't that fun. Each time I go to school, I see people studying and studying. It isn't my way of studying but the pressure they give me makes me feel as though I'm nothing but a slacker. I'm not really bothered about that but imagine some people indirectly showing off their good results when they know your results isn't good(It happened before). That kind of feeling isn't something that you can experience everytime. Truthfully speaking, that feeling sux! How I wish i could just give those people a punch!   But nah... I always take things easy. Most of the time in school, I'll just hang around with 2-3 classmates(all male). That's my way of avoiding those who always show off. Of course, this group of friends kinda feels the same way as me. Lol. However, they DO study, very much unlike me. ;P But nevertheless, I'll still try my best to pass this year in order to promote to JC2. If not, "Poly, here I come!"
