All the energy like electricity, and light, they seem to be doing good.  But how often have I let my God-given anger, control me.  It definately has not found its right channel.  Anger is used for taking whatever it is you feel like doing, out on the other person.  Anger results in just about anything these days than something positive.  Killing, hurting, slandering, putting down, dividing, and many others are the effects of this energy at its worse.  Anger should be used for solving the problem, SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  Usually it just creates more problems, not even close to solving them.  I can learn from this quote by using my anger next time, to get the problem resolved, and glorifying God in the process!  Jesus did it, so can we.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
