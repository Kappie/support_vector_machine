Oh, Tyke just couldn't resist.  But in all seriousness...yeah, there isn't much of this that is in all seriousness.  However, it was cool just breezing through the last full day of school periods today.  Lunch involved the entire crew going to FSM which was pretty good.  Then 5th period (or lunch #2) involved Tyke walking a little bit and talking to Dotti about Tolo and the librarian and such and then just going to his car and listening to music until Purdy came.  Then he went over to her car and they listened to Coldplay and talked.  Once again they were late to Physics despite running to class but it was only like 6 seconds so it wasn't that bad.  Oh hey, Haras just signed on.  Hey Haras.  But then after school Tyke and Skippy went to the Philosophy Society meeting.  Only for the Yearbook picture though.  There were some good poses.  He might go back next week as well.  After that Tyke and Skippy drove to Fred Meyer's to drop off Skippy's car and then they went to Redmond for some Tolo shopping for Tyke.  They went to Value Village.  And that store is just soo much fun to shop around.  Skippy got two great shirts with the Microsoft shirt being the best.  'IHS 91 We're Outta Here!'  That shirt is great also.  Tyke got a shirt that he is going to wear to school tomorrow but he didn't really see anything that he was dying to get like he sometimes sees.  He got a trenchcoat, a vest, and some pants as well.  His outfit sorta sucks so far.  It might not even be the 20s.  But he hasn't had much time to shop and he didn't get to pick what decade he was going to be in either.  The 20s is kinda hard.  Actually, it really isn't but Tyke isn't trying hard enough.  But shopping was fun and the pals drove back on East Lake Sammamish and they saw quite a wickedly awesome sight.  They were driving back and Skippy said he saw some smoke floating through the air down the road.  A couple seconds later Tyke saw it too.  Then they looked up by it and all of a sudden there was this huge flash and flames and sparks shooting everywhere.  It was soooo surreal.  A tree limb had fallen into the two power lines next to the road.  The initial flash was so bright that Tyke still saw it in his eyes as he was driving on.  But nonetheless it was one of the coolest things Tyke has seen in quite some time.  Tyke and Skippy went to Costco for a hot dog and broom trip and then back to Tyke's house for a few minutes.  Then down to the school for poker night.  That was fun.  Tyke played pretty well at first but got a little careless and made some bad calls before finally being taken out by a girl.  It was kinda dumb cuz when the people who had experience were playing those without experience they weren't really winning.  Cuz people didn't fold when you "should" and they couldn't be bluffed either so it was just a bunch of silly games.  Not to take anything away from any of the participants though.  And it was all for fun.  Which it was a lot of.  The pizza was good too.  Tyke stayed around for a while after losing and just chatted it up.  He played at the same table as Tina too which was fun.  But then he came home and had to take out the trash in the pouring rain.  Tomorrow is going to be fun though cuz Tyke is going to wear his new 99 cent shirt and there is an assembly schedule so that too is awesome.  Then lacrosse at night.  Looking to be a good day for Tyke.  No tests either.  :)  Grrr...this is an update.  Tyke has been pleasantly notified by Haras that Tyke does have a test tomorrow.  Not to mention some homework he "should" do tonight.  Physics triumphs once again.  Except this triumph is not a good one.  Stupid learning.
