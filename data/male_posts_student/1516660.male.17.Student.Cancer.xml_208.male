So, she asked my father to fetch her and her friend (Pei Pei) to work. To get a free ride to school, I decided to take my father's car. They are leaving at 5.40, so that means I have to wake up at 4.45. Sigh!! I reached the Inerchange at 5.45. So early. And so sleepy.  Hmmm...first hor, I got A-Maths 2. Woah!! I tell you hor!! It's so damn easy! I felt happy doing the paper, especially the Straight-Line graph! That question I know man! This is the topic which worried me the most, but I was able to solve it quite efficiently. Heh heh. The rest okay la. Some easy, some challenging. But hey! Very easy on the whole.  After A-Maths (finally over!), we studied Chem lor. Actually, I spent most of my time teaching Wendy Chemistry. Especially Organic Chem and techinques on Salt-Making. I feel that salt-making will come out, and Organic Chem has a high possibility. I didn't really revise much. Too much confidence in myself ba.  HaHa! The Chem paper was easy! Although it was harder than Prelims, on the whole, it was considered an easy paper. This time, there was more "memory work", asking us to state uses of so-many-things. Surprise surprise. Organic Chem only had one question appearing, and that was extremely easy for words. They asked for names of processes. Whoever got them wrong is really....go jump down the building la. No suprise that in essay, a salt-making technique was asked (titration). Hmm.....the only question that stumped me was something about measuing volume of methane/products formed in temperatures below and above 100 degrees. Other than that, the paper was easy.  Hmm...I was planning to watch Matrix Revolutions today. But never did I expect that the next avialable show is at 7. I told my Mother beforehand that I would be back at 6something. You can't expect me to go back on my promises. I have responsibilities you know. Sigh... Now these people are on a mission to ignore me. Well, everybody's speaking to me. Except for petty old WQ. Oh. Well.  Due to threats from my mother to switch off the main power (darn! Should have broke my promise...hate it when she do that!), I gotta be going now. Bad ending for blogs? Very. But we can't win under unfair dictorial maternal rule. So oh well. See ya tomorrow after History. Night blog!
