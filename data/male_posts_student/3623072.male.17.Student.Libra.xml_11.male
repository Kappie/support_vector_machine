Just now,im mum scolded for biting up my sis. well my sis started it first u c.. she likes to do silly stuff so that makes me mad and chase her in the house and beat her up. I really just hate that. She really loves getting me into trouble, but once i explained it to my mum. she wouldnt listen.  Bummer.  Wats even worst was my mum telling my aunt about my bad atitude at my sis.. Must she have to tell the whole world about wat im doing with my sis. For me, is like telling ppl im a bad image to the family. Which is no good for me.  :(   Oh god, i really need to cancel my dates for my two frends. Cos i really need time to rest before skool strts tomorrow.. ARgh!! Btw..
