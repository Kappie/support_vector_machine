Third rule of thumb: Never prod the sausages while they are in the oven. It might result in the sausages being tossed out of the pan and landing on the heating element, thereby resulting in a big sizzle and smog, and a pretty nasty stain on the heating element that would be a bitch to get rid of, if at all. These seemingly common sense and logical assumption can often be neglected by people who normally seem sane and even intelligent. The result is an extravagant fiasco within my very own kitchen. It almost seems like the kind of mist they put on in the Musical Fountains for the laser show. Only the connotations areway more negative. I am about to give you readers the account of today. The narrative based on sheer “human error” (euphemism for stupidity) that will shock even the most clueless of the readers…….     Omg….I think the protagonist here is getting pissed. Maybe I should discontinue with the proposed description. It would bring me, shall we say, a less than desired outcome involving a metal rod and a certain bodily orifice.     But still, remember………..sausages (shit, can’t spell it correctly. Thank God for Autocorrect). The equation is shown below:           Sausages + Very hot 10 mins pre-heated Heating element = Holy Fuckomoly!                           Well, since I can’t describe the “human error” I witnessed, you people can still see the articles i have below:        “Pancake” Thief        (January 2003,   India  ) Regarding accidental deaths during the construction of a subway in   New Delhi  , the New York Times wrote, "One of those killed was an unlucky thief who tried to steal braces holding up a concrete slab; it fell and killed him."             Sharp Landing     (February 2003,  East Timor ) A man was found lying facedown, covered in mud and blood, the apparent the victim of a street crime in Dili, the capital of  East  Timor . It was not until a post mortem examination was conducted that U.N. police were able to reconstruct his last moments. This up-and-coming young man decided that it was cool to shove his weapons, two long knives, down the waistband of his trousers. Unsheathed. The hapless fellow jumped over a small fence and landed in a large puddle of mud. He slipped, which sent the blade of his "trouser knife" into his leg, severing his femoral artery. He bled to death before he could stagger ten feet from the puddle.     Perfect examples of people that would sacrifice themselves for the overall good of humanity, by “removing” themselves and their stupid genes from the human gene pool (I had assumed that intelligence is limitedly hereditary). I’m actually writing this as a mild insult to the perpetrator that destroyed my kitchen, but since I hadn’t crossed the line by explicitly naming him, I can be pretty certain that the contents of my ass will stay the same. Hahahahaha!!!!
