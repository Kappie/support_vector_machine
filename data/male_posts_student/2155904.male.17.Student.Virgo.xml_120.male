Nothing much to say about today.  1st period involved Tyke running to his car and back to class in 2 minutes and then later on going down to the Commons to "do a lab" but really they just talked to people there.  Like Haras.  Haras asked Tyke if he would do an act for the talent show on Tolo week.  Tyke said, why not?  So he is going to have to make that up sometime soon.  If he does do one.  It isn't definite yet but it would be fun and Tyke can make it funny.  If it was super secret that would be cool.  Maybe he will do that.  Just make up a totally secretive show.  Then perform it.  But then it would have to be really good.  Whatever, it is only the beginning...Well the rest of the day was simple.  Ah yes.  3rd period.  That was funny.  Tyke's teacher finally called up Tyke to talk to him about his homework assignment from Friday.  Yeah, that was an interesting talk.  Of course nothing came of it but it was kinda hard to not laugh while he kept complimenting the teacher and saying she was doing a good job and that it wasn't her fault the class was rowdy, etc.  Oh man, good times.  4th period involved not doing anything.  But he did get homework in there that isn't fun.  When the homework is a creative writing assignment Tyke will definitely do it.  Otherwise, it just is a coin flip.  Oh, that gives him an idea.  Next assignment he gets in there he will just flip a coin to see whether or not he will do it.  Haha, that will be funny.  It's really a win-win situation there.  If he does it he wins because he will get some points, if he doesn't do it then he will win by not having to do it.  Lunch was at Subway but Tyke brought in his sub from home so it was a free lunch but still good.  The rest of the day was stupid.  Tyke did go with Skippy to B2 after school though.  But all they ended up doing was get a Strawberry Smoothie at Orange Julius.  But it was extremely good.  EXTREMEly.  Then Tyke came home, played ESPN, fell asleep accidentally again, returned Purdy's text, played some bball, ate dinner from Taco Time, sorta started his english hw, watched MXC, played bball, checked his email, breathed, brushed his teeth, did laundry, blinked, stood in his room facing the mirror with the lights off and then turned them on and watched his pupils enlarge and shrink as he repeated this, and blogged.  Not necessarily in order of completion though.  But it could be.  But it isn't.  Ok, Tyke is going to go to bed now.  Cuz he...yeah, just might want to get some sleep.  Tolo's coming up.  Oh, and 9 days.  Soon to be 8.  Then 7...6...5...4...3...2...1......
