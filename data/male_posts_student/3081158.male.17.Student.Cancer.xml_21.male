The gunmen lat  er released the officer unharmed and said the incident was intended to publicize his corruption. -   urlLink Washington Post     Damn. The violence there seems to escalate every day. Also, I'm worried about how much the Israeli civilians are being indoctrinated by  urlLink propaganda . About 80% of the Israeli's use television as their main source of news, but the coverage about those issues is definitely lacking. They will likely hear of the conflict, but not much of the political issues surrounding it. So, while it is reasonable to be aggravated by that kind of violence, there won't likely be rational discussion of the corruption that is taking place. Also, in the coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict they see on TV, "   there is almost nothing on the news about the history or origins of the conflict and viewers are extraordinarily confused about this  ." So, no wonder the Israeli people are irrationally supporting what has become known as "Apartheid wall." They've been misled by the media about many things, among them that the Israel occupying Palestinian territories was actually the other way around. No wonder public opinion has changed from overwhelming opposition to the building of the wall to nearly 80% of Israeli citizens supporting it.
