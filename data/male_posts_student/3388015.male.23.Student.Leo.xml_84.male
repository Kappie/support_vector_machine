I have completely reversed my sleeping schedule. 5am Pacific is 8am Eastern, when I normally wake up every day.    So I took a couple pictures this morning, one of the window that Danny broke last night and got cut on. I decided not to post the inside shots of where he bled all over to save all our stomachs from churning. I found out more about what happened.    Danny sleepwalks and tends to hurt himself by breaking through windows. He was sleeping in the garage last night and woke up and tried to get out... through a window that was paned, so he broke part of the window, climbed over a bunch of junk, cut himself really bad and then came back into the garage asking for help.     urlLink    Bloody Broken Window   On Friday, we stopped by Aaron's school where he is a PE teacher to drop off some paperwork. Mom asked me to take a picture of the kids sitting on the school sign. I felt kinda like a stalker.     urlLink    The school Aaron teaches at    urlLink    Nola and Aaron by Aaron's car packing to leave. We left the house around 9, got to Denny's around 9:10, ate breakfast, and then got to the airport around 10. Our flight leaves at noon, and haha! they have wireless internet in the waiting areas.    Talk to you soon. :)
