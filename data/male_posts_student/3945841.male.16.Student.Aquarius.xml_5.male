'twas a great day till we had chemistry!! mrs sundram sprang us a surprise test which was not due till tomorrow.. it was kinda fcuked up. and she didn't sport any festive costume at all. i mean.. she has a point there. why celebrate only one day of racial harmony day.. when its suppose to be there always. always embedded in our hearts that we should actually take note of other races around us. she may seemed like a "cynical wet blanket" like what tinah suggested. but she always seem to have her rights in doing her stuff.. she's quite a critique i must say.. she's always critical about the education in singapore and stuff.. about the politics that the human race has always fault in. she always has a point that i have to agree. she's a wise lady. i respect her.. and in all respects she deserves it.i aspire to be as wise as her one fine day. haha..i guessed that'll never be.. as she said she done it through SHEER hard work..tsk tsk.. i wished i had her determination. which i seldom lack pathetically.i gotsa ta go... bye peeps//
