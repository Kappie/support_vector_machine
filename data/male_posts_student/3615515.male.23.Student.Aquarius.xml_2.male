Truths lie off the beaten path, lurking in shadows to transform the reader from tourist to traveller, from voyeur to intrepid explorer."  ‘The God of small things’ is a touching narrative, a haunting tragedy and a slap across the hypocrisy and dualism of the social sytem that might still be existing in some parts of India. Arundhati Roy’s ability to play with the English language as a toy at her disposal makes this book nothing short of being a Masterpiece, one which no reviews or praise can do justice to.   ‘The God of small things’ is a journey – The journey of two children and the people who move in and out of their lives at different points of time.   It is the story of two young people, twins by birth, from a bittersweet childhood to an adulthood moulded by one bitter incident. When their English cousin, Sophie Mol, and her mother arrive on a Christmas visit, Estha and Rahel learn that “Things Can Change in a Day. That lives can twist into new, ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river graygreen. With fish in it. With the sky and trees in it. And at night, the broken yellow moon in it.”  As you read on, you live the lives of the people you read about. You experience the chemistry, the joys and the passion, the love, the songs, the tears, the fear and the pain of their lives.   However, what lies at the heart of the book is a sadness that is almost beautiful. Towards, the end of the book, the characters cease to exist as Rahel and Estha, or Ammu or Kochamma – what remains is a sense of loss, a void as if you yourself have gone through the traumatic and agonizing life that so many of the characters in the book have lived.  ‘The God of Small Things’ is a book about the greater emotions of life - Love. Madness. Hope. Infinite Joy. Never-ending Sadness.
