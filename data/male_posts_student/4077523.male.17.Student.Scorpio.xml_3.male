I am glad I am done with Band Camp for this year and I am so happy it is my last high school band camp, YAY! Yeah, i'm in the band, haha, I am the tuba playa. I think this is the first year I have been in this band where they actually took it seriously and didn't play around (as much).   Tomorrow, I get to go to my last day at work, it's just a summer job so no more paycheck unless I get a job sometime during the school year. Wow, i'm so tired right now, I can't quit yawning. So anyway, Fly with Christ.
