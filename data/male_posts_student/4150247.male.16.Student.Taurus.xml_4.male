I felt sorry cause i 4got it was her bday and i didn't have money 2 get her anything. But my mom reminded me b4 she came home from her job so I gave her a hug and a kiss. And signed a card my mom bought her so i was good. Then 2day was my sisters 19th birthday however i was prepared so after i woke up and did my excerise I printed a banner from my computer and a bday card so i was saved again. I would have liked 2 buy them a better gift but i had no money! Anyway now thinkin of it they both didn't give me anything cause they both "didn't have no money". But w/e. Also there was a massive storm on wednesday. It rained alot but i like the rain so it didn't bother me. So dat pretty much what has happened 2 me. TTYL
