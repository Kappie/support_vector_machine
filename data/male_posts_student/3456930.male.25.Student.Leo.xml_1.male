Even so, I still felt decidedly seedy this morning. Anyways, it was only a 3 hour shift and I finished at 10am. So I'm sitting there, drinking my 'staffie' coke, when Dave (one of the guys who works there) plonks a 'birthday pint' of black in front of me and says "For yesterday, because you buggered off before I could buy you one". 10am people!!! So I drank it. Very very slowly. Just about finished it when Bill, another one of the guys who works there, plonks another pint of black in front of me. "Happy birthday for yesterday, mate. I didn't know..." to which I responded with "Cheers Bill. Yeah, I tried to keep it on the low side". Had just finished that one when Doug, one of the regulars, puts ANOTHER pint of black in front of me. So, in the space of about 40 minutes, I've drunk 3 pints, on an empty, and decidedly uneasy, stomach. It's not yet 11am and I'm slurring my speech and feeling a little festive. Finish the third pint and then a schooner arrives from one of the other reguklars... at yhh this pont arm shlurring my shpeech and freeeeeling VERRRY drunk *hic*.  Drink it they say. So I drink it. By this time, the little bit of my brain that still contains rational thought surmises that everyone's trying to get me tanked and tells the rest of my brain to finish the beer and leave. Go home and sleep it says in its "I'm on my soapbox" voice. Funnily enough, the rest of my drunken brain riots and I haven't seen that rational bit since. I suspect he's lying in a ditch somewhere....  So I have another beer, vowing to myself that this will be the last. Hey, I'm no drunk and I have people I need to impress at dinner tonight. I don't want to turn up for dinner drunk and smelling like a brewery...    Eventually, I leave the pub. 3 hours after I finish. 4 pints and 3 schooners later. I'm holding my own against the footpath that threatens me with a painful slap in the face if I take a wrong step. I'm glaring at the ground, daring it. "Bring it on bitch" I mumble at it... people look at me strangely. I glare back. Good thing I'm wearing my work uniform with my pub's logo on it otherwise I think I may have been in trouble with some toothless skanky chick at the bus stop.  I have to powerwalk from the bus stop to my house because my bladder decides, at the most inopportune time, to suddenly realise that it's OVER full. Just make it. Have sobered up considerably. This is one benefit of having a stupidly fast metabolism. The downside is that I need to piss every 5 minutes when I drink. The upside is that I have the physique of a really tall rake with no chance of getting fat - no matter what I eat.   The downside is that I look like a really tall rake.  I sleep for a couple of hours until I get picked up to go to dinner. Feeling seedy again. Bugger. Haven't had an opportunity to do an A.G.B.   Can't stop farting. Mexican food and alcohol from the previous night is playing havoc with my inards.   Spend all night holding in farts. It's now 11:14pm and I feel crook from holding in said farts all night. I'm now letting them go with reckless abandon...  Uh oh... be right back...  *A couple of minutes pass*  Nope, I'm all good. *Grin* Heh heh heh...     Because, you know, you needed to know all this, right?    Stalker girl called by last night to wish me happy birthday. Wouldn't leave. Had to literally escort her home. Well, to her street at least. Won't take a hint it seems. Came round again tonight while I wasn't here....  Came up with a new word for faeces. Buttmud. Heh heh heh... pretty catchy, hey? You know what you're going to do now, don't you? Every time you need to go, you won't be able to wipe your ass without thinking "Heh heh... buttmud". I bet ya anything that's what happens. And I want 2 cents every time the word is used. LOL  Need to do something about Stalker Girl. She's starting to get on my nerves considerably. Is it my fault I'm the only person she knows in Newcastle? Not fucking likely. Go and get some new friends ya freak! Have decided to put this dog out of its misery first thing in the morning.   Feel the need to rearrange my bedroom again. Or at least change around the way I have my posters and artwork displayed on the walls. Try and make it better somehow. Thinking of putting up my Grad Show work... might look good.... see what happens though.    Anyways, I'm beat, so I'll go to bed now. Talk to you all soon.  Lowman X, out.
