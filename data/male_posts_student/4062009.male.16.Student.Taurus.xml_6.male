Right now know, I am not writing any but I will start up again soon, I'm sure of that.   Without further delay, here is my first poem  Day  Night .       Day  Night        Day and Night  Night and Day  Why wonâ€™t these feelings  Just go away.  It makes me wonder  Why my life is gray.  And still my life  Goes on stray.    These feelings I have  Just want to stay.  These feelings I have  Make me lose my way.  I try my hardest  To find my way.  Yet I end up  Moving farther away.    Night reaches out  to cut it out.  Day reaches out  to start it again.  It looks as though  My life is not so gold  And even now  I am growing old    Day and Night  Night and Day  Even to the end  I still lose my way.        Well there you go guys and gals. I hope you all like it. I wrote this poem for school for my Language Arts class and when I let my friends see it, they said it was outstanding. I hope that is true for you all here. Anyway, there it is.
