His house was kinda secluded from the road so it was a little creepy. He was nerdly though and small so I wasn't afraid but when he said come check out some other equipment he had for sale in his basement, my life sorta flashed before my eyes. I mean, you hear it all the time. Guy goes over to someones house and gets lured in and then WHAM, gets hit in the head while in the basement. Well it was on the up and up and I looked at his stuff but didn't want any of it. Just a creepy yet fun experience overall.    Phil Hendrie is on..........must listen....can't stop!
