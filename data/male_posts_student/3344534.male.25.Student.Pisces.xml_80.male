Iggy  Angus , Sloan  Someone better get insurance  To take good care of me  'Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck  Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see   'Cause if I stumble, then I fall, and get back up  Try to brush the dust off  And everything is black when I close my eyes  I lose all sense of time   It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good  I'm going to do it after all   We're still the same  After all these years  It's funny how you get a feel for it  When you finally lose your sense of fear   When Iggy said it's loose down on the street  Living in the city  And everything went black 'cause it's in my eyes  Everything denied   Kurt's still cool and Angus rules  I'm gonna plug it in again   We're still the same  After all these years  It's funny how you get a feel for it  When you finally lose your sense of fear   Someone better get insurance  To take good care of me  'Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck  Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see   It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good  Well that's all right  Kurt's still cool, and Angus rules  And that's all right  All right
