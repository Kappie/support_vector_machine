Because I'm currently pretty bored and it always seems like when I have a good idea or funny comment no one is ever around to hear it. For instance, I'm thinking currently of the sophomore student government. I suppose they're a nice group of guys and gals looking from an onlooker's perspective, but they're such morons.  So, here's my proposal: regime change. It seems like whenever someone hears the word "regime" they duck under their desks and scream "mommy." We need all 4 people replaced for any true originality, which seems impossible due to the fact it most likely is impossible. It'd be fun to campaign for a regime change especially running around campus with red-lettered signs saying "We want regime change!"  Next, there's this idiotic idea to have people in swimsuits, in a pool, in the dark, on inflatable objects, in a pool. Fun? We think not. (Notice my odd use of the word "we." We is just me, but it sounds twenty times more substantiated if you use "we." I assume someone out there must agree with me.) Foremost, this would require people to be  in bathing suits . Talk about a good idea gone wrong, but I like to tell the full truth which is three out of four people you don't want to see half-naked. Secondly, this would require getting wet which isn't bad in-and-of-itself, but there will be that 60-second period in between one running from the student center in wet clothing to the dorms or to a car in the middle of the night and it'll be cold. Lastly, you can't trust immature people. Some jerk will bring a watergun, I can guarantee it.  I've got a list of goals, it's long, but not  as  long as my list of things to do. Two good examples on my list of goals include staying fully clothed as best to my ability and staying dry. This would strictly go against those two fundamental principles. My world would seriously come to an end, maybe. In conclusion: there are people you'd like to see half-naked, but the number of people you wouldn't want to see half-naked out number the number you would. That's the dilemma. Seriously, it's not like a wild spring break where it doesn't matter what you can be a fat slob in a Speedo, because no one will remember you. (FYI: I am  not  the fat slob.) These people are maniacal, judging bastards, commonly referred to as my "peers." I use the term loosely of course.  I hope someone will enjoy this blog, because I had fun writing my first edition. Just to be clear, all of what I am writing is true but has a somewhat bitter, funny tone. Also, I'm keeping this blog with accurate spelling and grammar. I hate people who cannot spell. Hopefully, I can get some cool photos to go along with my blogs too, we'll see.
