So Reegan gets on the phone and tells me that Im not allowed to call her anymore. I have really no idea why. Apparently her parents read my blog, but there is nothing on there that is bad. Just the thoughts of a teenage boy with a crush on a girl. No drugs, sex, booze or anything like that. I am really destressed about this. I want to know what, if anything, I did to bring this ban. Crap, the first girl I really like who lives here, and Im not even allowed to call her. *sigh* Post later.  P.S. - If anyone knows anything about this please let me know
