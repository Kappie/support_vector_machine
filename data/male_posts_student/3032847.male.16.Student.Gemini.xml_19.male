Heh- animals... you can't help but think they have it better off? As for tigers and shite- im scared of my own daft foot long cat, imagine one of those things after you :-0. Couldn't help but notice there were a lot of fat, unlawfully fragrant people there too; like they were part of it! So, whats this, you fail to think. Well in the spirit of the internet iv'e started my own blog. Out of boredom. Not that I don't have things to be doing right now- like revising for the 9 GCSE exams im destined for next week, but for some reason I'd rather do anything else but that. 'Ey ey, caam daun caam daun..' Liverpool- to see my uncles band 'Haden' in 'The Cavern'. He's fuckin mint on the guitar. And he does well in his hand at the singin! A lot of the stuff was their own, but there was also some oldie rock and roll type stuff, and the darkness! It was perfect :-D and not that I don't like the odd nite away with the family somewheres but I'm glad to be home.  This was post 1. Let's see how long I keep this up for!
