What I did not realize is that her house is one block away from the Gaithersburg border. My parents wouldn't let me drive alone so I drove with my dad in the car.:-/ It was great to see Naveed, Aditi, Mel, Amanda, and Ray again. We had fun doing some strange stuff... some not so strange. we looked at  urlLink this is not porn  and I freaked naveed out. Long discussions about aliens and odd skulls also occured.   After spending a good 3 hours hanging out, making junk food and stuff I was picked up and brought to Jeffrey Liu's house for Alex's suprise party. That was pretty good too. Amanda pwned us all in DDR, and everyone got squirted (with a squirtgun sickos) in the crouch. Now I am tired and wish to sleep.
