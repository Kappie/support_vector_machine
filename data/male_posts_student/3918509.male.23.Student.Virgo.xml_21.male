I appreciate Kristof's effort, though his ignorance of Christianity, and apparent lack of effort to verify some of his information, seems to partly explain the problem; people are often hostile to things they know little or nothing about.   A couple of problems:     " there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism "  -- Uh-uh.  urlLink Romans 1:26 .  Important to note that gay and lesbian activity is listed right along side lots of other sins indicative of we who "worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator" (Rom 1:25).  This list includes such zingers as greed, envy, arrogance, gossiping, and disobedience to parents, to name a few.     " And in polite society, conservative Christians -- especially Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses -- are among the last groups it's still acceptable to mock. "  -- Well, getting warmer, that is if LDS and JWs  really were  Christians. There are a few fundamental differences between LDS/JWs and Christians, namely the nature of God, the nature of man, and the relation between the two.  Doesn't a man like this at least have an editor or someone who knows the difference?  Sadly, probably not.     " But there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism at all. And since some fundamentalists have argued that AIDS is God's punishment for gay men, it's worth noting that lesbians are at less risk of AIDS than straight women. So if God is smiting gay men for their sin, is he rewarding lesbians for their holiness? "  -- interesting argument, if this is really what most Christians believe.  To be fair, many do.    On the other hand:     Liberals often protest that they would have nothing against conservative Christians if they were not led by hypocritical blowhards who try to impose their Ten Commandments plaques, sexual mores and creationism on society. But that's a crude stereotype, and it ignores the Christian right's accomplishments. Polls show that evangelical Christians are more likely to contribute to charities that help the needy, and in horror spots in Africa Catholics and other Christians are the bulwark of the health care system.  Good. And: It's always easy to point out the intolerance of others. What's harder is to practice inclusiveness oneself. And bigotry toward people based on their faith is just as repugnant as bigotry toward people based on their sexuality. Right on both counts.
