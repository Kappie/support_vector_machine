After extensive time taking into consideration all of the possibilities I've come to the conclusion that Asian's will rule and become the only race alive. Quite terrifying but true at the same time. I'm gonna list my points and theories:  1. Asian's account for more than 1/6 of the WORLD's population and thats just in China alone. We multiply exponentialy, like rabbits hyped up on redbull and viagra. I know this because I get you know whats ALL the damn time and it's fustrating. We are so horny we draw cartoons with the craziest stuff you will ever freakin see.   2. There are soo many Asian's we are spilling out everywhere, you can find Asians in any part of the world. In the future everyone will be so overwhelmed with this that they just die out and are forced to mingle and soon the mutts will be weeded out.   3. Asians are damn smart and make freaking robots that can move and will soon carry lasers with destructible powers. Asians make tons of electronics and we make all of the happy meal toys. Asians are invaluable and you can't live without them but you can't live with them either.  4. Um........oh hell yeah I forgot, Asian's know karate and can really kick your ass. Too bad they too into video games.   Well there you go I have some more ideas and stuff just that I gotta get to bed and all. Anyways I know its hard to believe just look at the points im making this plan and theory is flawless. I know I'm part Asian and all, frankly FULL Asians freak me out. Small beady eyes, and the flat nose, and short. Most look really creepy and look really bad with any facial hair. Asian women are annoying, omfg especially when they sing or talk in Chinese or whatever. All that high-pitched squealing is nerve racking. My mom is a great example, I seriously can't see how anybody think Asian women are hot. If anyone else know's of or has a theory they would like to submit then just post it here. see ya later
