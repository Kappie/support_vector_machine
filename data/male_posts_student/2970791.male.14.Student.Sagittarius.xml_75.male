In other news, Tucker created this awesome piece of work, possibly using declassified CIA technology:       It's going to be the cover for Ted's album when it is released. That should be happening fairly soon, with any luck at all. Oh, and you can click right  urlLink here  if you want to see a real photo of Ted.
