Of course i had to ditch work to have this "fun" day, and for that i got bitched at from my dad AND had a guilt trip given to me from my manager. Then me, Amanda, Roxanne, Matt and Courney drive down to Matt Harpers house to light off fireworks. That was actually a lot of fun, its really funny how afraid of fireworks Amanda really is. After all that, we (me and Roxanne really) decide we should go down to the beach, and Alex decides to come along too. So we get down there and its great, the waters so warm and me and Roxy give each other this look of "Oh god we wanna go in!" So finally we do. I actually took my shirt off...ewwww...and i somehow talked Roxy into taking her pants off. All she had on was a pink thong...jeez was that hot. I felt bad for looking since Amanda was there, but she has been pissing me off lately. Well, to make a long story short, Matt doesnt come in cause he doesnt like the beach to begin with and then of course Roxy and Amanda call him anti-social and all that, he gets pissed blah blah, everyone ends up pissed at each other. Then we drive back and Amanda decides to go with Alex and Roxy back to his house and leaves me home by myself (cause i had to be home early because of my dad), fucking god she pisses me off sometimes. I dont even know why i listen to her. She only ever thinks of herself. Of course she always does the lovey duvey shit. Oh i love you this, i love you that. But thats all it is. She can never compromise a situation. Its either her way or the highway. And she wonders why i get pissed off sometimes. Ive gotten to the point that i just want to punch her in the face, just square in the fucking face just so she would stop talking or laughing or whatever she was doing at the time. I wish things were the way they used to be when we first started going out. But i guess everybody wishes that from time to time. She doesnt get how things work sometimes though. If i ever make her feel bad for any little fucking thing, im a dick. And then all this drama with Matt and Roxanne. They talked...that did a lot of fucking good now didnt it?! All Matt wants to do is make everything out to be his fault, i keep telling him it isnt, but he just wont listen. And then Roxanne just doesnt understand why things happen when she does stupid shit...its like Amanda in a way...just she sometimes thinks things through a bit more...sometimes...UGH! I love them both though, i really do. I dont think i could think about life without them as friends...even though i havent really known either of them for very long, i feel so close to them. I just wish they could get past this fucking...THING between them. Its so frustrating. God this sucks. I havent felt this way in almost a year. Having so much shit on my mind that I just wanna cry 24/7. Of course thats a real pussy thing to say, but who cares...no one reads this damn thing anyway. First my mom decides she wants to come back into my life. And of course my asshole dad constantly getting on my case all the damn time. Then theres the pressures of money and thinking of how im gonna pay for college...what college im gonna go to. I dont even know anymore. Now all this other shit with two of my best friends AND more frustrations from my own girlfriend of a year. I wish this thing would give me some kind of feed back for my problems. I guess that kind of defeats the purpose of a journal though, huh? I mean, in a real book one you wouldnt get any feed back. Eh, whatever...im done writing, till next time...
