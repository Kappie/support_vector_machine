I mean, fear factor has really cheesy contestants........it's a game of dare.........just go there and do the freakin stunt~! there's no need to play on other people's fears or blah blah blah..............and may i add, DURIAN IS NOT A DISGUSTING FRUIT~!!!! it is a delicacy...........how in the world can they use durian in one of the eating stunts is what i wanna know............  lightyears sucks bcos of the characters squeaky voices............my god...........and get this...........it's a show about polytechnic life shot in a university campus....ahdoh~! another major flop for sure..............now i'm wondering, what is so interesting about polytechnic life that mediacorp can make 2 serials about poly life so far.........there aren't any serials about JC life nor uni life.............so wat's the thing about poly life? hey, if squeaky voices and relationship probs make for good tv then i think just about anywhere will make for a good location for a serial..............except for maybe the old folks home...................  miss singapore universe sucks why? bcos i'm hoping it is not the true representation of s'pore women............not the word here is HOPING.............IF the beautiful women in singapore are really the same calibre (mentally) as they are............think i'll go take a vow of celibacy if that's the case..................my god..........and the new miss singapore universe has a 'fierce' face.................her looks will definitely cause a fight in a kopitiam..............not bcos they people are fighting over her............she has the "kiam par" look....................basically..........bitch face............sigh.............what were the judges thinking.................
