Simply because i didnt like it, and i've learnt some things about myself.   First of all, i'll start with the teacher i had. Her name is Nicola and she was there to make my life hell for the past week. Everything i've done is wrong. Yeah i'll admit it now, i might of deserved SOME of the tellings off, but she just cant take a joke.   I think it all started on the first day. We went around the group telling each other about ourselves. When it got to me, i said "My names Craig, i got 2 brothers. Thats it". So then Nicola asks me "Are you glad to be here?" I said "I'm tolerating it". I think this set her off because ever since shes been out to get me. Then, out came the dummys...Annie i think their called. I take it you all know the proceedure by now, so when i was supposed to wake her up, i started picking her up and moving her. Not the best thing to do when your trying to make a good first impression. But i know for a fact that i wouldnt do that if that situation ever came up. Just like all the other stuff i've been told off for!   In my class with me, its Andrew and Hannah, with the others, plus yours truly. So as you can see the first thing thats pissed me off is the fact that me and my mates arent together. If Andrew werent there i wouldnt of came because there wouldnt be any point really. If i needed a certificate to show people what i've learnt then fine, but i dont. If someones having i heart attack i bet you that they couldnt care less about my friggin' certificate, they just want help and quick! Plus i've got my book to help me if i need it, but i doubt that the chances of my being on my own when theres no one else  around and someone collapses is low.   So, this week i worked with Hannah for doing a sling, and i'd finished my sling on her and waiting for Nicola to come and have a look at it, so while i was waiting with Hannah (who wouldnt shut up) i decided to tie a bandage round her mouth. It did the job and she saw the funny side, as did everyone else that saw it, which was most of the class. Then when 'her majesty' turned around and saw it, she just went off on one. And anyway, i dont think i wouldnt bandage someones mouth up if that ever happened!   I thought First Aiders were friendly. Hmm, maybe i'm thinking of someone else. Anyway, she threw me out the room and told me to be more serious, but if it wasnt for my joking around, i wouldnt be there. So she could of either accepted the fact that i have a sense of humour and i like a laugh, or she can come and kiss my ass!   So anyway, i came back in the room, and  when i done the sling again, i tightened the knot and Hannah sort of had a back spasm and she couldnt move till she took some painkillers. Then, we were all sitting back in the circle again, and someone made a joke...and she laughed...i thought we were meant to be serious and here she is laughing...tut tut Nicola! Thats what i hate in people, they tell people not to do something then eventually they do it themselves. They've got to understand this and learn their lesson.   People know me and know i like a joke. I like to laugh, yeah. In fact i laugh at a lot of things, i cant help that, thats me. But when certain people tell me i cant have a laugh to enjoy myself, then that gets me worked up. I havent felt this pissed off since...well i cant remember the last time i was this stressed out at something... i hate being stressed, its not me. This woman has changed me, and not in a good way. She should go back to London, or wherever the hell it is she comes from! I'm glad that i'll never have to see her ever again...unless of course she turns out to be a relative of mine or something bizarre like that (hmm wierd, i never use the word bizarre!).   So, i've failed my first aid anyway, but like i've said i dont need a badge to show people what i've learnt. I couldnt care less, and thats why i havent wrote that much about it. And if they think i'm doing it again in September then they can think again.   Anyway, my test is out of the way and i'll never have to do first aid again...yeah i know what your thinking, but until that happens i'm free!    I've seen Shrek 2 and i can tell you now that it is worth going to watch if you havent already. Its a great film and i've seen it twice already. I've also seen Spiderman 2 and that is great aswell. Their both really good films for sequels and i gaurantee you'll enjoy them.     Speaking of Spiderman 2, i'm planning on getting the game soon, which looks really good in the ads i've seen. I just gotta get some money first, plus money for my new phone, and provisional.    Anyway, i've applied at safeway, which i've already had an interview for. I'm just waiting now for a reply to see if i've got it. Hopefully i have cuz i've got maccys on my back waiting for me to arrange an interview. No affence to maccys or anything but i'd rather work in safeway. Oh and theres the fact that wayne works at maccys.....thats a different matter though.    So there you go, the second column for my new site (i'm calling it my blog - which it is) and Saturday i dont know if i'll be writing anything because i'm out at my Nan and Grandads 50th Wedding anniversary. And tommorow i'll be looking back at the year at college.    Thank you everyone,          Peace!
