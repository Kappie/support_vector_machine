I know I was supposed to have a "clip show" for the first year anniversary of my blogger, (which happened to be Tuesday) but for a number of reasons, I have decided against it...  NUMBER ONE:  My computer, as well as Blogger, has been stubborn and not been helping me with.....anything.  NUMBER TWO: It's hot.  No. No.  Stop it.  No, you be quiet.  It's hot.  Ok?  NUMBER THREE: It's come to my attention that when one looks back on my archives, the largest majority of what one will find is me complaining.  So I thought, "Hey, why not celebrate a great year of complaining with more complaints!"  So there you go!     HAPPY ANNIVERSARY "A SINGLE TWISTED THOUGHT"!!!
