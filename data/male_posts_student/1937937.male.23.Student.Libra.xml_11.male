Since g(Y) is contained in Z for all Y, and B is contained in Y, g(B) is contained in Z.  Since B is defined as f(X), then g(f(X)) is contained in Z for all f(X), and since f(X) is contained in Y for all X, then g(f(X)) is contained in Z for all X.  Thus, (g o f) is injective.    [10/2.2]    If f : X -> Y and g : Y -> Z are surjective, then (g o f) is surjective.    Let A be f(X).  Since f is surjective, Y is contained in A.  Since g is surjective, Z is contained in g(Y).  Since Y is contained in A, then Z is contained in g(A).  Now, since A is defined as f(x), then Z is contained in g(f(X)).  Thus, (g o f) is surjective.    [10/2.3]    Given f : R -> R by f(x) = 4x - 5.  Show f is a bijection.    First, we must show that f is an injection.  Given x and x', we know that f(x) = f(x').  We need to show that x = x', which is simply a matter of doing the algebra:  4x - 5 = 4x' - 5 4x = 4x' x = x'  Second, we need to show that f is a surjection; that is, for every element y contained in B, there is a corresponding element x contained in A such that f(x) = y.  This is also simply a matter of algebra -- we need only find the inverse of f(x) and ensure that the function f(f^-1(x)) = x  y = 4x - 5 y + 5 = 4x (y + 5) / 4 = x  f((y + 5) / 4) = x 4((y + 5) / 4) - 5 = x (y + 5) - 5 = x y = x  Thus, f is a surjection.  And since f is an injection and f is a surjection, then f is a bijection.    [10/2.4]    Given f : R -> R and f is differentiable on the interval (a, b), a   0 for all x in (a, b), then f is injective on (a, b).    This statement basically says: if we know that f(x) is continuously increasing on the interval (a, b), then we want to show that for some y in Y, there is one and only one corresponding x in X.  It's obvious when one considers the graph, but to prove it, we must consider the  urlLink Mean-Value Theorem .  This theorem states that for some point c on the interval (a, b), derivative f'(c) is equal to the slope of the line (a, f(a))-(b, f(b)).  Thus, we can say the following: let a1 and a2, a1   0, we can say that for all a1 and a2,  (f(a2) - f(a1)) / (a2 - a1) > d  where d is a positive real number.  Thus,  f(a2) = -a1 * d + a2 * d + f(a1)  Since we know a2 > a1 and d is a positive real number, then we can say that a2 * d > a1 * d, thus (a2 * d) - (a1 * d) > 0.  We can then say that f(a2) > f(a1) for any a2 > a1.  Now, we consider a2 = a1:  f(a2) = -a1 * d + a2 * d + f(a1) f(a2) = f(a1)  Thus, f is an injection.    [10/2.5]    Let X = Q+.  Define f : Q+ -> Z+ as follows: for each element p/q in Q+ (p, q integers with no common factors), set f(p/q) = 2^p * 3^p.  Show f is an injection.    Let us consider the possible cases of p, q, p', q', and prove by contradiction.  For p not equal to p' and q = q',  f(p/q) = f(p'/q) 2^p * 3^q = 2^p' * 3^q  Because p is not equal to p', we can assume that p > p', thus:  2^(p-p') * 3^q = 3^q 2^(p-p') = 1  But this is a contradiction, for 2^0 = 1 and p is not equal to p'.  Case #2: p = p' and q is not equal to q':  Because q is not equal to q', we can assume that q > q', thus:  2^p * 3^(q-q') = 2^p 3^(q-q') = 1  but again, this is a contradiction, for it imples that q = q'.  Thus, we have shown by induction that f is an injective function.
