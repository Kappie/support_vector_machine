It's as though every CD or even song I listen to is by one of those three bands.  I think the next CD I want to buy (after  Mutual Admiration Society , the collaboration between Glen Phillips and Nickel Creek, which comes out next week!) will probably be the Flaming Lips'  The Soft Bulletin .  All the songs I've heard off of it have been excellent; wonderfully crafted epics with tempo shifts, mini-suites, and elegance woven into them.  Went and had lunch with Audrey.  She was charming and bright, as per usual.  I swear, I don't know that girl nearly as well as I'd like, but every time I've encountered her, she's always had a smile on her face and nice things to say about anybody and everybody.  She's a genuinely good person; or, as Everett phrased it (and I think this is probably what I was trying to express when I described her to him), she's a virtuous person.  You don't meet many of them these days, but Audrey is one.  So's Beth, come to think of it--people for whom their convictions are exceptionally important and heartfelt, whose morals and ethics are strong and well-grounded, and who don't let any of that stuff get in the way of being genuinely nice and glad to see people.  I always leave a meeting with people like Audrey feeling like I should be a better person and that I don't deserve to be in their presence.  That's really what it boils down to--there are several people--most of them female--whom I know and feel not only privileged to know, but that I'm somehow not fully worthy of being their friend, that I'm some mucky sewer-dweller who's been granted an audience by a holy person.  I've been playing twenty questions (or a variation thereof) with Mel online most of the evening, just for the fun of it.  Basic stuff, like favorite movies, scariest moments, etc.  It's an amusing diversion from the crap I should be doing.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "The Spark that Bled"
