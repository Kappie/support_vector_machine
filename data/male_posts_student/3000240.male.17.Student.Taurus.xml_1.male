I was desperate, and I mean of the highest most amazingly vital necessity, to take a piss (if not I assure you there would have been a puddle on the floor if I had held the tide in me any longer), and he tried to grab hold of me literally, and have one of these chats he seems to solely give to myself and NO ONE ELSE!!. So I replied "SHUT UP YOU IDIOT" to which he replied "WHAT!", as I ran as fast as I could to the nearest lavatory. He tried (the poor thing bless him) in the lesson there on in, but thus, it was no use to himself, as I continued to mock and down right dissolve his self esteem right to the lessons end. It was a fabuloussite to behold . . . xBuBzx
