Starting Friday we left at 8 and returned about 2 on Sunday (today).  Here's everything we did and some applications I've learned in my trip and a little before.  Well, Thursday was quite a day (yes the day before we left).  I decided to have Stephanie over because it sounded like a fun idea, and I hadn't done it in the longest time.  There was a ton of preparation that had to be done Wednesday though first.  I was feeling pretty bad on Wednesday night because I had cleaned up the whole house pretty much and Steph was a little too busy to talk to me on the internet after I spent all of that time cleaning.  I got mad and logged into invisible mode on the YIM so if someone wrote me I'd know, but I walked off from my computer so frustrated I couldn't think straight.  My mom noticed my emotional state and asked me what was going on.  I told her (I'm so glad I did) and she asked me what was the sense in what I was doing.  I couldn't come up with anything.  I went back online and just waited.  I didn't know what to say, and I was very frustrated at my predicament.  Eventually Stephanie asked me why I logged off.  I said that I didn't know.  After that we got into some huge dialoge about our friendship.  It got so late that she said we would pick it up tomorrow so we could resolve the problem.  That was on my mind the whole day Thursday.  I woke up after four hours of sleep to go to the dentists office.  He said I have no cavities, but that I really really need to get my wisom teeth out because they weren't working at all.  (jk)  They're growing in sideways, like 90Ëš off.  I decided that I wanted a prize for my teeth; so, I got some disguise glasses with the mustache, the big nose, and the eyebrows (that was my stupid moment for the day).  After that we went to pick up Stephanie.  All that stuff was still on my mind as we went to pick her up.  We picked her up and I just started talking about other things.  This carried into our bike ride about the hood.  I showed her everything around including Butler campus.  When we got back to my house, she showed me her house and stuff on Animal Crossing (I have to get that game) and then we played Super Smash Bros. (That's the game I need to get).  We did a bunch of other stuff like watch movies and play some other games.  I found out I'm incredibly horrible at air hockey; don't ask why, I guess we're just like oil and water; we just don't mix.  When it came down to the end of day, we never talked that problem through.  I would have liked to a couple of times, but the times when I wanted to my little sis was there and I didn't feel comfortable talking in front of her.  I doubt we could have come up with a solution anyways.  OH! I forgot to say what the predicament was.  I won't got into specifics on any level.  There may be some guy in her future, and I don't like that because it's going to take away from the friendship her and I share.  Because of that reason, I become irritated when she starts to like a guy.  Being irritated with that makes me irritated in myself as well because I know I shouldn't be irritated.  She has a right to like a guy if she wants.  So, we never got to work through that problem which kinda irritates me knowing that I still don't know how to control my emotions.  All that happened on those days.  Then on Friday, we woke up at 8:00 in the morning.  I had quite a road trip to get there.  As I was going up, I had a couple snacks then I went to sleep.  I woke up just before we reached Illinois to see all of these signs for Krazy Kaplan's fireworks.  It was some picture with a derranged monkey holding a firecracker.  It was hilarious.  When we got to the hotel, I helped unpack, then we went to the cubs game.  The trip to get there was quite an adventure.  I rode the L to get there.  For those of you who don't know, the L is a huge train thing made up of several trains.  We got on the blue line at O Hare and switched to the red line at Washington.  We got off the redline at Cubs stadium.  I loved the hustle and bustle, the crowded quarters, the forceful rocking of the train.  It was awesome.  While at Wrigley field, my mom and dad went into a gift store, I just waited outside.  I loved the smells there (aside from the beer and cigarette smell).  We got to our seats and I found out I couldn't see home plate or first thanks to a pole that was in my way.  I had a hot dog from the park.  It was awesome!  After the game (I was so sad that the cubs lost) we went back to the hotel to get a good night sleep.  I saw two movies for the first time, Haunted mansion (incredibly stupid, but kinda funny at times) and Jumanji (really great, funny and over all really clean).  I was shocked at some of the language in Haunted Mansion.  I mean, it's a Disney movie for crying out loud; the story line wasn't too great either.  Then I went to sleep.  The next day I was suprised at the fact that I got 8 hrs. of sleep.  I was also surprised to find that we weren't going to ride the L again as we had planned earlier.  We decided to ride a bus to get to this huge mall.  I was feeling really bad because the full affect of my selfishness in my friendship with Stephanie hit me.  I shouldn't keep her from liking anybody just so I can be her friend.  If she likes some guy, of course it's going to hurt, but that's not my place to get in the way of her happiness.  I knew I told her earlier that I was going to get something, so this frustration of my depression made me determined to get something really great for her.  The bus ride was pretty cool.  I've never ridden on a bus at all before; so it was quite an experience.  We got off at the mall and started looking around.  I looked in tons of stores for stuff, but didn't find much.  I went in a couple of stores for me, of course, and a couple of stores with my family.  The most unique store I saw was the Apple store (named for apple computers of course).  I realize how advanced technology is now, but that store made technology look advanced.  I-pods, cpu software, speakers all made to look so advanced, it was incredible.  We got hungry so we all went to go eat at this burger restaurant called Red Robbin's.  The had some awesome and honkin huge hamburgers there.  They were great.  Then our dad bought us some cubs jerseys.  I got a blue Wood jersey; I would have liked white with blue stripes, but no one had it.  Anyways, I couldn't find anything for Stephanie in any of the stores I went through (including the gift store at the hotel).  Eventually I saw something that I thought I was going to get her, but I decided I liked it a lot more than she would.  It was a Cubs electric guitar pin.  It's awesome, but I didn't think she'd like it too much; so I decided it'd be better staying with me.  After we got done shopping (we couldn't even go through the whole stinkin thing in like 6 hrs) we went back to the hotel to watch a movie.  That's right we saw Elf.  It was pretty funny, pretty clean, and pretty goofy at times.  After that I went to bed (c'mon now, I need my beauty sleep; a loooot of it).  The next day (Sunday) we pretty much packed up and left.  On the way home I figured out something that should have given me better quality pictures on my camera so I tried to take a couple of pictures of the Krazy Kaplan's Fireworks billboards.  I actually had the privilegde of seeing the actual Krazy Kaplan's store.  I felt so blessed and honored (you'd have to see the bilboard to get the joke).  Then I got back and found that Colleen was mad at me.  I have no clue why, but she was.  My first stop was my computer so I could post for all of you guys.  It took me straight until Tuesday morning to get all of this posted.  I sill think Colleen is mad at me, but I know Steph isn't.  I think I was able to work out my problem within myself, but that will remain to be seen until another day.  Anyways, sorry for making ya'll read all of this.  Peace out ya'll.
