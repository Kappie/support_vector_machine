'S funny, I was looking at the blog today and wondered why the phrase "Rambling Drunken Monkey" kept coming to mind - then I remembered this used to be  called  that.  It's nice to know I'm not just going insane (more so).  Hyper, my love - Doll is still upset that we let those college guys go . . .apparently she  wouldn't  have claimed to be from Boston. ^_~  Dollface - *giggles* . . .*giggles more*  Was it sunny today?  To the rest of you - hi ho, hi ho, it's back to hell we go!  Vacation's dying fast - but only three more weeks til Regents! Love!
