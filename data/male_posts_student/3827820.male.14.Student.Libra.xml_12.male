Thank you Singpore for giving such a long holiday! *Phew, at least I can temporarily escape from overwhelming stress...  Bah, what I did for the whole morning and afternoon is a presentation on Paradox for Maths ACE... hope that this thing would save me from my critical state of ACE Points!  Went to Subang Parade to do some boring shopping. At least what I benefited from this trip to the mall is that I got a long-sleeve shirt in my dreams (but now NOT anymore!)... actually I was first hesitating whether to buy or not, as what Boing Yuan / Lucy / I-Pad told me a horrible experience by wearing long-sleeve shirt. He said that he wore it to a concert and met up with Mr Goh (my form teacher duh!). Guess what Mr Goh said.  "Wah, wearing pyjamas har?" he made a remark.  Anyway, I'm happy today.  Teddy-O-ted, wow, new shirt!  *Tips of the day - never ever wear long-sleeve shirt when having an outing with sacarstic people...
