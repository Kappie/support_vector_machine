I remeber this place where i have lived and think how beutiful it really is. But, as i remember the past i am forced to think of the choices and paths that are still ahead of me. I search for at least one thing that will draw be back here after i leave, that search has not long to go. I have my friends and family, but somehow those alone will not bring me back or maybe even keep me from ever leaving. I will search and find trusting God to lead me all the way...........
