But instead of setting it to snooze, i turned it off.. hehe.. fortunatily i got woken up to the sound of "Why isnt my fucking computer working".. From my dad -  heh.  Anyway i didnt do any revision yeserday.. Gonna make up for it today.. And btw i started my little project of my msn plugin, its going well!  //Out - Chris.
