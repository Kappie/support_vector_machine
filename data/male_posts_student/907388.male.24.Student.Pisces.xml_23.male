It was declared when we least expected, last evening. The expressions on the faces of the students, when they heard the news for the first time was worth a thousand words.... not all of them pleasant. But then, such is the charisma of the man, that there were no questions asked. Everybody knew and expected a bad day, and he did not disappoint. Okay, maybe I am being a bit harsh on him, the test was not THAT bad. The questions were pretty easy, the answers were a whole different ball game.  But this first quiz, did give us an idea about what to expect in the next two years. I am waiting for the 12:00 am class lecture, he conducts one of them every year. The results are going to be out sometime soon and then, maybe even before that, we would have had many more tests and presentations.  But then, as one prof rightly put it, we are here to work and they are going to ensure that we are not disappointed. MALOY
