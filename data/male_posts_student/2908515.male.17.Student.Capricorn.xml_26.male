I'm not in such a remembering mood now.  But there was this retelling of a conversation after lunch.  Some people are just so sheltered.  Its not even that.  Maybe sheltered isn't the right adjective.  Some people are just ignorant of certain facts about sex.  Sure, why would they care about them?  I guess I'm just looking it at a curious person's point of view, but a person should know what goes on in the body of the opposite gender.  I won't begin to tell you how sad it would be if they don't even know what is going on in their own body.  So people were explaining to this girl about circumsizion.  However you spell that.  Anyway, they retell that conversation in front of me thinking that I will turn red or something.  Instead, I turn slightly insulting in that I call the other girl sheltered.  And turn around to really focus on the work.  Since we were dealing with somewhat lethal chemicals, neurotoxins and whatnot.  Somehow, a lot of people there think I'm a genius.  Or really smart.  Or they're just joking.  Which is confusing but anyway.  So we're doing the experiment and every so often, I wow they with random science facts.  I guess they like that.  Like the agarose gel.  The enzyme for that is procured from seaweed.  I think.  Tch.  I thought these people were smart.    I told them my story about how I went to Condom Kingdom with my friends.  Great adventures.  Suddenly the sheltered girl just says "Can we talk about something else?" which was kind of dumb since I wasn't really talking to her to begin with.  So I go on a whole rant about how it'll do her good to hear about these things.  And how she should go down to the ghetto to learn a few things.    Its funny, cliques.  They form.  Which is a by product of the small group.  I can't complain too much, the cliques sometimes interchange members.  Everyone knows each other now.  Insulting each other in a friendly way.  *shrug*  So I was measuring the lines from the standard protein samples from the electrophorisis test when someone behind me puts their hand on my shoulder.  Actually, she has been doing that somewhat during the whole day.  And its really bothering me.  I hate it when people touch me for no apparent reason.  Like a "oh, how are you?" sort of thing.  Damn, no one should touch me.  Ever.  Well, until I deem it necessary.  But I don't want to be a stick and tell them off.  I mean, its not like they know I don't like being touched.  I just wish people will be less willing to touch other people.  In fear of a stabbing, right.  Just one more day.  Just one more day.  Just one more day.  Crap, just one more day.  whatever.
