SEE YA!"  goodness that really bothers me.  and girls wonder why guys dont take the hint.  its cuz you butter them up with compliments before ya break up with them.  then when you do the guy just doesnt get it, right?  yep.  he's all thinkin "so wait a min... she says all this great stuff about me.  tells me how good i really am.  and then she breaks up with me.  what is up with that?"  and lemme tell ya it eats away at them.  at least it ate away at me.  its like the ultimate confusion.  she says your wonderful... but obviously not wonderful enough for her.  same thing with just friends in general.  they're all "oh you're such a good friend.  i trust you so much and i tell you so much and you're just a great person that i like to be around.  blah blah blah etc."  and then they go and dont even treat you like that.  its like everyone is so full of compliments cuz they're afraid of hurting people's feelings.  compliments that dont even mean.  but in truth all they're doin is makin it hurt more.  cuz now they havent just hurt your feelings by break up with you or not treating  you as a friend... they've lied to you... which hurts your feelings even more.  so yanno how we can solve this problem?   cut the crap .  dont lie.  tell the truth.  you break up with someone.  dont tell them how wonderful they are.  because to you its obvious that they dont mean enough and all you're doin is settin them up for disaster.  makin them feel worse.  if you arent friends with someone... dont pretend to be.  dont lie to them and make them believe that they are.  cuz when they finally realize they arent... then its just gonna hurt them so much more.   just stop .  stop lieing to yourself and to them.  stop building people up only to bring them down again.  get a life and while you're at it.. a heart too!
