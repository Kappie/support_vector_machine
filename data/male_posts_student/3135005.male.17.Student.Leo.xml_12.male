What is it thats holding me back? I know it can't just be attatch, because I know if i find a girl i really like I still would go with her. Guys here cause too much problems for the girls. Thats why girls here have so much drama going on. And even if they don't tell you, you can see it in their eyes. Guys always comin up to them and sayin shit like, "Say shorty", or "Bitch you fine". Thinkin they're all thugs and shit. One of the girls i talk to even say that, "most girls don't like guys who try and act all thuggish, cause most of them can't get a girl". Girls here can rarely find what they look at as a "gentlemen". From the simplest thing like holding the door open for them. That's why the girls here tire me so much. Most of them are just a cute face, for a classic example, Tasha. For yall who don't know what happened with her, here is the story... There was this girl i really liked, Tasha. Of all the girls i know she topped them all... well I thought she did anywas. She has alot of other shit going on with her, and i don't want to get caught up in that. Guys have fucked her over too many times, now it doesn't seem like she trusts guys at all. Thats what happened with Tasha. That happened 2 months ago. Now there is this girl, Dolly. This is one girl that I didn't base my liking her first on her looks. I talied to her and got to know her first before i started liking her. And again, I'm putting no effort into trying to get with her. I don't know why and i feel lost... and thats a first for me. She is really smart and her personality...damn. This is probly the first girl I've ever liked for intelligence and something above just looks. And i have been with alot of girls, and no not to brag, just to prove a point on the incredibility of this. Almost all of my ex girl friends and past girls i've liked has been brought first by there looks, and if personality followed i looked at it as a bonus. Yes you can say that  is  rather shallow, ill take that blow because i do deserve it and ill owe up to it. Looks are what catch your eye first, but none of my girlfriends have been ugly, or average looking. And i can't say they all had good personalities. But i don't know how it did come around with Dolly in the first place. But when she asked me this question, "why didn't you talk to me before? we've sit beside each other for 2 months", i had no answer. That's what started getting me to think about all of this. Why didn't i talk to her before? I don't even know how we started talking. She is probly the most real girl ive met since ive gotten here. Actually no, that would be a lie. The most real girl i've met since i've gotten here would be Hannah... she is a chapter yet to be revealed. But all i'll say there is i hope there isn't a Mushu guardin her to. But back to Dolly. I hope something will come out of this. Hopefully ill come out of this barrier im in. Maybe there was some truth in what Dragon said,"your too immature"(i put it in blunt terms). That is one of my sides. There is my playful and carefree side, then there is my serious side. No I'm not suffering from manic depressence. Different people see different sides to me. But i originally have a playful and carefree nature. When it comes to the point or when needed, I am very serious, there is more then what  you  may just see. And i think tora just learned that recently. People who really do know me are the people who were my close friends while i lived in edmonton. Thats because edmonton is the only place where i could be me. Here i can't, and i don't think ill ever be able to be me here. So in the end, i do hope to get over this "cast the fishing rod, catch the fish, stare at the fish and don't do anything, and walk off when it jumps off the line" (sorry for the big metaphor, but i think u understand my camparison).  Thats a bit of me for you, know you can say you know a bit and have some insight...
