I made five of six up and downs around the green, all for pars. one green in reg on #7 for a par. I took 14 putts, three putting the ninth for a 6 after laying up after a mediocre drive. My other double was on five where I drove it into the water and then missed the sand save for bogey from the right trap. I had a good out, but the putt didn't go in. I also was in the sand in front of 8, with a downhill lie, and almost holed out for birdie (easy par, though). My bogey was on 4 with a short two putt.
