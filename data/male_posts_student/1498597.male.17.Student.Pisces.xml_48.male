Of course, after I was done reading the  P.R.E.  it didn't leave me with much time for now! So, this is just a quick message to acknowledge the fact that  Nick  works the  Morning Shift .  So....... how about that weather? Yes, it is really nice outside! It will only be about 76 degrees today which is really nice. I have a  Teen Advisory Council  meeting today at the  Corona Public Library . I'll expand more on my personal blog.. "RTOIYD". Yes, that is a long acronym. Anywhoo: (hahaha) school is going to be hectic today and tomorrow, but most of all TOMORROW. Of course, I will definitely blog tomorrow because of the crazy events taking place.  Ok, I will have to blog this afternoon I guess! Stay tuned!  ------ Nick
