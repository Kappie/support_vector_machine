Ill just post random stuff that pops into my mind at the moment, and I'm sure I will be able to put more "intresting" post up later.  Anywho, about this danm blog.  I was told by someones mother I should start to keep a journal becuase I have a very odd way of thinking.  Which brings me to my next little thing,  If people are going to be looking at this I can not and will not post any names if there is ANY chance of offending anyone.  I will not post incriminating things that I do not feel people should know about and to be honest,  This is allready seeming like a shitty idea to start a blog.  The reason I am not doing this on paper is becuase I simply cannot write that fast and keep it readable.  I'm guessing my blog is going to have the word "Shrooms^" Around somewhere so just to explain that a bit...  I'm a nerd and Shrooms^ is the name I have been using for quite a while now for gaming online so I just sort of stuck with it.  Infact there is alot of history behind that name and it even goes back to having over 300$ worth of servers and stuff for free. "Good times" and infact I'm talking with some friends from school on ventrilo right now. (Just part of the free things I get for being so good at gaming :)  Oyes and the URL to this blog is like bigglassofwater or something like that.  Yeah umm... I picked that out at random, I had a huge cup of tea and that was like the only thing that came to my head so Ill more then likly change it later.  I'm done talking about my blog, Ill fix any problems with it later.   Its now 2:30 in the morning and I have to go to the DMV tomorrow and pick up my licence then go to CV and register for school.  That will be my day unless I go to a friends house  which I probably will.   I'm going to end this post here and see what my blog looks like and how I should fix it.  If I had a laptop that would be so tight, then I could do my blog thing from anywhere.  P.S. Ill make my font and stuffs more eye pleasing later.
