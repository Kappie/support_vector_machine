After the fall of the Taliban, he fled to northwestern Iraq and worked with poisons for use in potential attacks, officials say.  During the summer of 2002, he underwent nasal surgery at a Baghdad hospital, officials say. They mistakenly originally thought, however, that Zarqawi had his leg amputated due to an injury.   In late 2002, officials say, Zarqawi began establishing sleeper cells in Baghdad and acquiring weapons from Iraqi intelligence officials."  Late 2002...hmmm...the war started in March of 2003.    It looks like BUSH LIED about   Iraq not being linked with al Qaeda ,   not having WMD  ,   Saddam having prohibited missiles  ,   Islamists not supporting Saddam since he wasn't religious  .....   uh......
