Many of you reading this may be wondering how the hell that came into being.  Well, let me explain.  I mostly listen to metal, myself.  I have a lot to be angry or saddened about, and just as some are uplifted by their music, metal is just a part of who I am.  I like it because it's not as diluted as some of the other types of rock, and it sounds much purer than other types of music to me (this is my blog; if you disagree here, you're just wrong.  Refer to the disclaimer at the top of the page).  As such, I can enjoy the simple honesty of country, the complexity of good rap, and other types of music that do exactly what they say they do.    I'm getting to a point here.  Punk, unlike many other types of music, is completely impure.  It focuses on the material aspects of the music industry, more than any other type of music (have you ever seen a heavy metal shop? a country shop? I mean, really).  A lot of metal focuses on opposition to Christian virtues, but most of that which does (death metal doesn't count because that stuff is made for the sole purpose of being immature) does it from an adult perspective, and generally gives a more mature, direct outlook on that.  Punk, in contrast, does not take a direct stand against Christianity.  Why, you ask? Does it support Christianity? Considering just how many punk songs are about fornication and drinking, I think the answer to that one is a resounding "Hell no!".  It instead attacks the "mainstream" as a whole.    Now, you may be asking yourself 2 questions at this point (at least): what's wrong with that, and why is "mainstream" in quotes?  It's pretty simple, really.  They can't attack something that doesn't really exist as an item and still say that they are doing something original without being hypocrites.    If punk were still out of the musical loop, do you think punk bands would make half as much money off of things such as clothing, posters, and other memorabilia? Do you think they would have almost anyone buying their music, except for the cult following that other less popular types have?  Hell no.  Thus, it stands to reason that they are definitely in the "mainstream" by this point in their existence.  That is, if the "mainstream" actually exists as a thing that can be opposed like they are opposing it.    Now, when you think of an average punk fan, what do you see?  I know I see an irresponsible teenager, holding a skateboard, defying his parents on everything, with no real direction in his life or even ideas about what he or she would do.  Why is this my average stereotype?  Because punk fosters complete commercialism, spawned by the very thing much punk proports to hate: corporate greed.  Because this the type of culture punk supports:  irresponsible, carefree teenagers, dumbed down enough to actually believe all the shit all those who foster punk culture spew out.  Basically, bacterial culture.  If this keeps up, there won't be enough real people left in this country to actually do work.    But it can be so much more disgusting than that.  In my Che post, I said that I've been seeing communism and socialism coming back into prominence.  This is what I was talking about.  When these punk fans are way past their prime of DO THE DEW, X-treme, happy-go-lucky youth, something deep within them realizes that they have nothing to contribute to society.  So, who should pick them up? The far left faction in the country, of course.  They recognize that these people have nothing to lose, and so pick them up with easy, false promises of financial stability and environmental co-existence with wildlife.     Through the lovely system of disguised socialism.  And that is what it really is, no matter what they call it.  And it sounds like a good idea.  However, since there is no incentive to work, any socialist economic system as a whole will quickly (historical time-wise, don't comment to me about how the Soviet Union was significant in the greater scheme of things; they were communism, anyway, so they don't count) fall apart.  Moving on to communism, it does work, but so did Hitler's regime.  This doesn't make it desirable by anyone's standards.  So why do the far left in this country want this?   Power.  It controls every aspect of this mentality, no matter how small, to every corner of it.  Money is just another form of power, really, albeit a less direct one.  And power is why I hate punk (to get back to the point).  Lust for power ruined what could have been a legitimate branch of the noble lineage of rock and roll, corrupting it for something as fleeting as power over a socialist government.  And that is why I call you, whoever the hell you are, to boycott punk music.  Turn off the radio when you hear it, burn any CDs of theirs you find, don't download a single song of theirs.  If they want to get away from the mainstream, they can...with a little help.  Help out the American way and join me in hating punk, that unholy font of corruption.  Now, I have other reasons for hating punk, but this post took me way too long.  I'll finish it up tomorrow.
