Right now Im sitting at my computer free of all that however, as i found out it was all over nothing at all. Some issues sarah and i had to work through were adressed and now all is right in the world.  Next all i have to say is today i went shopping and picked up a kickass watch and a kickass t shirt  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/store/product.asp?LS=0=270205RN=292  (go there to see shirt).  Peace!!
