Everyone should receive them soon.Each invitation includes a photo folder with pictures taken on the day of the wedding and one taken last summer. Also included in the invitation is a bookmark with smaller sticker pictures and the date and time of the dinner.  The bookmark also includes all of the kids phone numbers.  The date for RSVP is July 23rd.  I included a stamped envelope to return the menu selection for each guest.    urlLink
