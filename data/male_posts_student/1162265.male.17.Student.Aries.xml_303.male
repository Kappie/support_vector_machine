Fuck you last page of a the thesis paper! Foxwoods can wait!  "Memetics is the study of ideas and concepts viewed as "living" organisms, capable of reproduction and evolution in an "Ideosphere" (similar to the Biosphere) consisting of the collective of human minds. Memes reproduce by spreading to new hosts, who will spread them further (typical examples are jokes, catchphrases or politicial ideas).   At present memetics is somewhat controversial. Partly this is due to misunderstandings about what it means, leading to claims that it excludes human free will, creativity and progress, and that it is bad science. This will likely change in time, as the field matures." -Anders Transhuman Page  It's really funny because Snow Crash was written about memetic warfare, but they never called it that.  Snow Crash, in the book, was a religion, a virus, and a computer virus.  No to mention it was also a drug, I believe.    I guess the paragraph explains itself, except the point about it claiming people have free will.  Silly modern science, thinking we have free will.  I'm going to go laugh at all people who think we have free will right now. Then I'm going to listen to Dead Prez sing "Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery, allthroughtout history, look it up."  Then I'm going to try to finish my thesis paper.  Stop working for a few hours, and then do Journalism.
