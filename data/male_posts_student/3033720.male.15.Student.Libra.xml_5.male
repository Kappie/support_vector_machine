When I went into the building, I went and dropped my instrument off, said "yo, sup" to Adam, Ponder, and Josh, and then i went to English. That class is such a waste of time. I dont think i've learned anything in there, and what I read on my own is a much higher level. Anyhow, after that I went to visit my favorite person in the whole world for Algebra 2....Mrs. Connor. Supprisingly, she didn't seem like she was on her period today, and wasn't extremly bitchy. Chase and I pulled our own hair out and put it in this girls hood. Loads-o-Laughs that was. Until Chase told me to pull one of her hairs out....she didn't take that very well. Our homework was easy; it was over angles. In third period, biology, Mrs. Wey was nice as usual, and it was really easy. I had to take a sax lesson from Smokin' Bob, so i didn't get to eat. Band was fun, I talked  with Tiffany some, and thats about it. After band, i had to go to an AFS meeting, then I just sorta sat there with Ponder for an hour or so. When i came home, i did my math, slept, and am now writing an essay.  Quote of the day: DJ King, when asked his opinion on love at first site by Mrs. Hayes responded, "My door sorta swings both ways on that one."  I'll try to keep updated, but as previously mentioned, I am grounded, so it will be hard.
