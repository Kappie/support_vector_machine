After all the sneaking around Juli was very surprised.  I had planned on just hanging out for an hour or so, but my brother in-law's brother and girlfriend are just like me so we hung out all night.  We made fun of people drank and all of a sudden 3 hours had passed.  Well @ 10 they left so I got in on a conversation with my sis and her husband and some of her close friends I've known since she's known them.  I got home @ 2 in one piece so all-in-all it was a good night.  Now Juli says she's gotta throw Curtis a party or his feelings will get hurt.  They're stupid!  Well until the next time.  ~opphold negativ
