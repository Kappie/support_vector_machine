Honestly though, why do humans do it?  To impress other humans?  "Heheh, look at me! I dress nicely! I have money"  I mean, it's shear stupidity.  "Yes, I wear a tie" 'Why?' "I dunno.  B/c everyone else does?"  ::sigh::  And they call this evolution.  In Douglas Adams's words: "It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much-the wheel, New York, wars and so on-whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man-for precisely the same reasons." Found  urlLink here.   Anyway, must be gone now. ::mumble:: ::grumble::
