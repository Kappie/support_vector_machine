So now that i'm back with my trusty pc, i've been searching for a windows based equivilant.  It doesn't seem to exist.  But what does exist is Google.  They are going to take over the world, and when they are done, it will be a much, much better place.  The stuff they have going over at urlLink google labs  is just amazing.  I downloaded the deskbar, which lets you search from your desktop instead of having to open up the browser.  It sounds lazy, but i prefer to think of it as amazingly efficient.  also search by location will make finding the phone number of the pizza place around the corner much easier, you type in your search, and an address or zip, and you get a map with whatever you searched for marked on it.  lots of other cool stuff, but these seem to be the most useful so far.
