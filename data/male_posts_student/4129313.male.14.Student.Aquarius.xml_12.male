And the coolest thing is, is that all the quotes are from Einstine himself. (xept for 1 or 2 wich I thought were just to hilarious lol) So I was thinking, It would be cool to do something like that for my blog. And then I realized, all it was was a few stratigicly placed java scripts. I'm gonna try it later and see how it playes out, if it gives any messages when loaded or anything, I will have to remove it.
