So yeah, Helen Keller's tic tac toe was a pain in the neck until Mr. Harden found the logic errors that drove me crazy. Once that was found it didn't take long to fix the problem. Now lets talk about some Fleet Manager calculations. Am I the only one getting 6,000 $ more on the total cost after its all added up? I'm thinking I did some screwy addition. Its all good though I'll look at all the excess as profit ;) I think I'm gonna start working on a I D 10 T form for the fleet project, please drop me a line as to what ya'll think should be on it. This is for all those "smart" people in the world!
