They wanted me to die so badly and they are waiting for me to surrender myself…. I can hear their laughter in my mind like “Ha ha ha ha ha, you are going to die Xing Yi!” The another one goes like this “Xing Yi, I want you to die… die ……die…..die…..die….. DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE….. HAHAHAHAHA!”  I dreamt about them one night, they slowly surrounded me in a circle where I was in the middle… one of them said “You have nowhere to escape…. You should die…..” Then everyone started chanting “Yes! You are going to die….. Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die, Xing Yi should die…..” I then shouted back “NO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”. This went on over and over throughout the whole dream until their mouth became tired and thirsty…. One by one just knock down… Then here comes the Energizer battery, which ran out of nowhere and advertises itself with the slogan “Never say die” to my classmates. I was at ease that moment because at last someone or I should say something came up to them and helped me speak up. After this, I woke up from my sweet dream.   Why they want me to die? Because they are too jealous of my schoolwork. I had purposely handed up all my assignments late and they still don’t let me off. There was this girl that keeps on encouraging teacher to deduct my mark in class, another guy try to pursue me not to do the same topic of the assignment as him, a close classmate of mine is even smarter, trying to bribe me for doing his assignment for him.  They are now combining force to find ways and means to bring me down even if that is to resort to underhand methods because they know I pose a bigger threat to them in class. I am fine with it, I know they always put on a fake smile in front of me trying to be kind to me.   Will be continued…..
