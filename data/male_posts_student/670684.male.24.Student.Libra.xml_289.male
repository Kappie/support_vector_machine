Absolutely wonderful time, though the inability to get in the water will only stir my desire for gulf ocean, to be sated the last weekend of August in Freeport.    Not much to say...how do you condense 11 hours of car chat into a blog?  Memories, EverQuest, relationships, work, friends, sex.  I pitched a few scripts.  If Daniel Harr were an agent, I'd be writing this whilst lounging completely naked in a pig pit of $5's.
