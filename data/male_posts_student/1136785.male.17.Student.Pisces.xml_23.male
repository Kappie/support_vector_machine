I know I'm probably the first person to discover this tidbit of information, so I will hope to spread it to the ignorant masses through the most important electronic document archive in the universe - my blog.  The last two days have been incredibly trying for me, if only for the fact that I generally appreciate the knowledge that now I am awake, therefore I am not asleep. That comfy realization has been taken away from me, in my weakened drugged up state. Laying basically comatose in either my bed or my chair, not really remembering when I made the effort to move from one to the other, I essentially lost all track of reality. Slipping in and out of what can roughly approximate to a waking dream, I felt alot like blind/deaf/mute quadruple amputee Joe Bohnam from  Johnny Got His Gun . Or at least I would have, if coherent thought was possible on my part. I also decided that as long as I wasn't engaging in any perceived human interaction, I may as well be asleep - a sort of Shrodinger's cat theory of consciousness. So thats what I've been doing.  Well, thats nearly all of what I've been doing. As I became more and more ill over this past week, I found myself becoming more and more emotional. Typically I only have three moods - self centered jocularity, narcissistic rage, or conceited sulleness. I don't like mere thoughts can bring a tear to my eye. I don't like it when I'm so desperate for human interaction as some form of validation that I practically begin to hypervenalate. I like to consider myself above such things - certainly not implacably rational and logical, but at least colder than your average person. Having feelings is too troublesome a third of the time, and the other two-thirds theres no good reason. Everyone is suffering from the same damn thing, and everyone wants to be loved. So why the hell is my situation unique enough to demand some self-involved tragedy? Wow, I have divorced parents and a bad stepmom and crap siblings - thats so amazing! I must the be only person like this ever. Give me a break - those feelings are just giving into weakness. Its just teenage bullshit, and while I don't out and out disapprove, I try not to take part in it. I'm just glad I'm already queasy when these outbursts surge up.   Now that I have attained a state where continued existence is preferable to the alternative (what am I talking about? I love myself too much to ever prefer that. I simply longed for some subcouncious womb like state, which is what I wass essentially in) I can at least make some reasonable descisions about that existence. I think its tme I begin to withdrawl into myself again, not an unusual habit of mine. I've become overbearing and assholish, and that accomplishes nothing. Long ago, years,  I used to literally wait by a phone hoping someone would call me, so I wouldn't spend another weekend alone. But I soon grew up and realized I should be a man and that if I wanted to do something with people and have it in someway involve me , I would have to plan it and execute it. This is been my modus operandi for some time, being the planner again and again until the event is so regular that it runs without my involvement, but still requires it. But now I feel I've over extended myself - I essentially force myself upon people becuase they amuse/interest me. I open channels of communications and interaction entirely out of self interest, and force them to remain - ignoring the will of the other. I toy with people to make me feel better, making me a sadist in every sense of the word. I cannot consider myself at least moderately thoughtful (though I often don't) and allow this action to continue. I cannot permit such behavior on my part to go unhindered if I actually notice its existence. If I want to be decent to other people, I shouldn't force myself upon them. Luckily, I only have thirteen days left for this to be an issue - after that crushing loneliness shall lead my to renege on this idea and fanatically desire some equivalent of friends. I stress that I do realize I have some friends who I can easily talk to, but I also realize the distinction between the ones I prop up for me and the ones who are real.  Thirteen days...wow. I feel like Kevin Costner in that bad movie (wait, all his movies have that distincton!) I still haven't realized that I'm going to be holing myself off in New Haven, Conneticut for what amounts to my entire summer. Just to begin to lay the scaffolding that will allow me to get ready to commence building the foundation from which I can then learn Arabic. Somehow I've convinced myself of that absolute neccisity that I become fluent in that tongue above others. So while other people are laughing and playing, falling in and out of love back home, I will be freezing my ass off trying to decipher a completely alien script with people that will more than likely loathe me - with good reason, as I shall despise them. Why? I don't know damnit. Because it may be the key in my future to prove to generations just how much bigger my dick is than everyone elses. Good enough reason for me I guess.   Boring, yet Important  Firatly I encourage to check the the last one of these as I made an update regarding the fact that Sonia Gandhi has walked away from the position of Prime Minister of India.   Onto newer, all together more horrifying business. The United Nations had admitted it is "the worst humanitarian crisis in the world". In one of the better case scenarios, only 100,000 people will die from starvation and malnutrition directly related to this crisis. Roughly one million people have been displaced - the government has literally armed, unleashed, and given  carte blanche  to convicts, with orders to loot, rape, and pillage. They are even supported by the army and airforce. George Bush is seen as a source of salvation in this country, where he is possibly loved more then anywhere on earth.   Here is the story of one of the inhabitants:   HER children's bodies were rotting in the village wells, where Arab militiamen had thrown them to poison the water supply. But Kaltuma Hasala Adan did not flee her home. Leaving her crops and livestock would condemn the rest of the family to death, she reasoned. So she stayed put for four months, despite her government's strenuous efforts to terrorise her into flight  Her story is typical. Her village was first attacked in January. An air raid caught her unawares: as the bombs fell, she ran around in confusion. When the bombers had completed their return pass, the horizon filled with dust, the ground shuddered, and a host of mounted militiamen charged through the village, killing all the young men they could find. During that first attack, Kaltuma's 18-month baby, Ali, was killed by shrapnel. Two weeks later, her oldest son, Issa, 15, was made to kneel in line with other young men before being shot in the back of the head. Her husband disappeared the same day.   For four wretched months, Kaltuma lived with both ears strained for the faint drone of bombers, poised to dash with her three surviving children to a hiding place in a dry river bed. Then the janjaweed—an Arab militia that kills for the government—rode up to finish the job. They razed her village entirely. She fled from the embers of her hut and trekked for four days through the desert. Across the border in Chad, she found sanctuary in the town of Tiné. Thousands of her neighbours were already there when she arrived.  As Kaltuma tells her story, a crowd gathers to corroborate it. Osman Nurrudin Sadr says his whole family was killed. Khadija Yacob Abdallah, a pretty 17-year-old, watched her parents die and was then gang-raped. All the refugees offer the same explanation. “They want to kill us because we are black,” says one.       If you cannot already suppose from key words like "Across the border in Chad", this horror in happening in the Sudan, Africa's largest country by landmass. I suppose you were expecting me to say something incredibly suprising, like the USA or France or the UK or some first world nation. The reason I withheld the name is to demonstrate the popular ignorance of this atrocity. No one seems to realize not only the magnitude of whats going on, but the fact that something is happening at all.   Sudan is currently in the midst of not one, but two civil wars. One has been raging intermittently since the country gained its independence in 1956. In Sudan, the north is predominantly muslim and Arabic, while the south is mostly black africans, who are animist with a very small minority of Christians. When independence came, southerners demanded autonomy and were ignored. So they rebelled. Between 1972 and 1983 a peace was actually maintained, but for the past nineteen years war has raged. The goverment in Khartoum, dominated by a Muslim Arabic elite, has enganged in scorched earth tactics - razing entire villages to the ground for suspected rebel sympathies, and encouraging raids and the slave trade in the south.   Foreign influence, especially American pressure, has encouraged Goverment negotiation  with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the main rebel group. Talks have been tortuous, but finally some agreements have been hammered out. The biggest debate is for the petrodollars coming from the oil rich regions in the south, a major reason why the north is so loathe to let the south go. A deal on how to split revenues and map laying out the the path for the withdrawl of northern troops have been reached this year. For an interim period of six years, the current President Omar al-Bashir will remain president and John Garang, leader of the SPLA, will be his deputy. After six years, the south will have a final vote on whether to secede or not. Worries over the North simply biding its time to reassert its dominance and because no agreement has been agreed, let alone touched upon, about what will happen to the oil rich regions if secession is chosen - the goverment in Khartoum will surely not let those petrodollars slip away. The south itself is fairly divided. Still, a formal end to this war is expected to be announced later this year. George W Bush is widely seen as the architect of this peace - he may be more popular in the south of the sudan than anywhere on Earth. Or as one young warrior said while leaping into the air, brandishing a white barbie doll; "This is a new wife for President Bush. May God grant him many fertile women with firm bodies and an election victory without problems in Florida."  The other war is taking place in the West, and has been largely ignored for some time. Many groups feel left out by the peace between Khartoum and SPLA, as niether group are remotely representative or democratic. This has boiled over into outright war in the Dafur region. Two new rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), appeared in Dafur and managed a string of successes. The Goverment's response was quick and brutal - to quote the economist directly simply because I can not manage a way to restate this horror -   It unleashed the janjaweed. To swell the militia's ranks, Arab criminals were released from jail and given horses, $100 each and carte blanche to loot. (These ex-prisoners are labelled ta'ibeen,“those who have repented”.) The janjaweed have clattered into village after African village, torching the straw roofs of conical huts, killing young men who might join the rebels, raping women who might feed them, and stealing everything they can carry off. Sometimes they brand the hands of women they rape, to make the stigma permanent. They have also torched dozens of mosques and torn up and defecated on copies of the Koran. Whatever inspires them, it is not Islam. Their victims have no doubt that the janjaweed enjoy the state's blessing. When asked what gives them the right to stop blacks at road blocks, the militiamen reply: “We are the government.” When pillaging, they are often supported by the air force and by the regular army. “First the planes come, then the janjaweed and finally government soldiers,” says a refugee. “They are brothers united on a mission to kill.”    The rainy season is arriving, and soon all ability to reach these refugees will be nil. Ten thousand more streamed over the border, but the UN classified them as combatants even though it is mostly women, children, and the elderly - because it can not handle any more load. Vast swathes of fertile farmland have been burned and depopulated of their non-Arab inhabitants - who are accused of harbouring rebels - by the Janjawid since August 2003, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). "With rare exceptions, the countryside is now emptied of its original Masalit and Fur inhabitants," said the watchdog in a campaign entitled "Help end ethnic cleansing in Darfur" launched on 7 May. Anything that could sustain life - food, livestock, wells, blankets and clothing - had been looted or destroyed. "Villages have been torched, not randomly, but systematically - often not once, but twice. "Most of the displaced, who number over one million, have been forced into urban areas, where they remain virtual prisoners, as they are vulnerable to attack if they leave the settlements, according to a US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency fact sheet dated 14 May. Unable to return to their farms to cultivate, they are missing the annual planting season, which ends in late May or early June when the rains begin. The consequences of no harvest next November, plus the limited capacity of aid agencies to operate in Darfur, could be catastrophic, say humanitarian workers. Roger Winter, the USAID assistant director, predicted this month that once the rainy season begins, 30 percent of the affected population could die over the next nine months. The UN has increased its estimate of conflict-affected people in Darfur from 1.1 million in April to two million this month.Charity organizations are under just as much threat from attack as the rebels themselves.

The robots would replace researchers who painstakingly collect water samples in bottles and take them back to the laboratory for analysis, an expensive, time-consuming and sometimes dangerous practice. By summer 2005, Syracuse University researchers will have installed a dozen robotic sensors to form the largest underwater monitoring system of its kind in the country and one of the most extensive in the world, said principal investigator Charles Driscoll, a professor of environmental systems engineering at Syracuse.
