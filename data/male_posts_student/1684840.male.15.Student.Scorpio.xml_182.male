I've been out with Sam, Chris, Craig and James (sometimes) doing loads of cool stuff like throwing ourselves off skateboards and stuff... lol!    Ok, so Thursday was fun.  Me, Craig, and Sam went into town, taking loads of pictures for Geography coursework.  We went up and around every place imaginable (except certain... places) the called for Chris on the way back (for some odd reason we keep seeing Kylie... freaky!  ).  Me and Chris hung out a bit in my room and at about 6pm went out with Sam and Craig, James joining us for a short 5 minutes, to the area near James' house.  We filmed loads of cool things such as Chris rolling down a hill into nettle bushes and stuff.  We did sort of the same thing today whichw as really cool.  James came along and he did a bit too.  I've had such a cool time with my mates recently.  I'm glad because I'm not going to have a lot of time to be out enjoying myself before I move.  I'm gonna try and get some group photos with me in them as well for memories and stuff    I really fancy a burger from Chillis   (a brilliant American food place).  I'm gonna be off to bed now.  Getting up early to go to town with the gang again heh.  I must do some work before I go back to school also
