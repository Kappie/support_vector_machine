She will be moving in to the house in the last week of June and will (unfortunately for her) be here for my parents' moving out. She'll get to witness the chaos and stress first hand. It also means that my room just got more cramped! Yesterday, we went out and purchased a 4' tall plastic chest of drawers so she can keep clothes here for work. She and I will probably be going back to her parents' house every weekend in preparation of moving out here permanently.  I have to get ready to share my space with someone else and not really having the space to do it. I have a bathroom and bedroom meant for one. But it will definitely be fun and exciting! I think stuff like this just brings us closer together. (Ain't that sappy?) I'm looking forward to it. As I see it, I get a preview of living with Patti BEFORE escrow closes.. *evil grin* ;)
