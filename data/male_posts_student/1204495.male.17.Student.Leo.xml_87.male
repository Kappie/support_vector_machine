In some ways a job interview is just like a test, i mean you have to go and explain stuff about yourself to the people at the interview, same on an application form, so pleh i cant be bothered going to get a job at this moment in time, hehehe i'm writing this without even looking at the keyboard, *feels proud* :D  Back to the present day, at the moment i've just come back from doing a paper round, my so called job, but hey £15 a week cant be bad for round 3hrs work can it now? i mean my sister got paid £3 something an hour for working longer hours at Kwik Save, its the same at most supermarkets, young people looking for a job are cheap labour in their eyes, if you get what i mean, i mean you can hire round 2 young people part time for the price of one older person fulltime, so i guess it makes more sense for them to hire young people these days, but then thinking about it you dont exactly get really good customer service now do you? this is one of the reasons why i prefer local independent shops, i mean you can go into a local shop and they'll say 'hi' or 'good morning/afternoon' its that bit of customer service which makes me feel happy and which is why i prefer local independent shops much more than your big supermarket. [end of rant, got to finish paper round off, so i'll continue this little rant later on when i get back around 5.30ish]
