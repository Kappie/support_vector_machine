I then had to mow the entire front and back. Then I went to my cousin's to watch the game. Today was the Spooner Street Mafia's 3rd band practice. It was awesome. We played Can't Stop from Red Hot Chili Peppers. It turned out great. We also attempted to play Real Big Fish - Take On me but it didn't work out too well. After the practice, I basically just ate dinner, played more drums, did homework, watched The Matrix Reloaded special features, actually played Gamecube, I'm sick of that system, then checked the Yankees score... 4-0..woop! Then...well now I'm reading "A Seperate Piece." What a horrible book! Uh...ya that's all. Life is too boring, I wanna get older so I can drink beer all the time like my dad does, get a tattoo, and get a girlfriend...well I can get one now, it's just, I'm ugly now...I'm guesing I'll get good looking when I'm an adult because they always say the ugly people in your high school end up being the super sexy models! I hope it's true for my case. LATUH.     >helpme.exe
