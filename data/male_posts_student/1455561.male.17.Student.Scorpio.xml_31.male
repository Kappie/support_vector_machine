Although it might be better to crank it up to 4 first and then see what happens.  tempting to just go mental for a month and try really really hard to do everything really well and do loads of extra work just to see if i would destroy the universe because thats what i imagine would happen, i am phenomally clever already :)  do you have a sign in your room saying "danger crocodiles"? no, see how clever i am.  There arent any crocodiles in my room, but having the sign merely highlights the fact that there arent any crocodiles which only instills awe in people.  If there was a crocodile then having a sign above stating that there was such a cold blooded reptile about would just be silly, not helpful.  But there arent any so it is ok.  some people might say that having a crocodile sign where there werent any was just being unhelpful and was designed purely to play with their emotions like an epileptic playing the spoons.  But i would claim that they are a bit of a wazzock for even thinking that a crocodile would fit into, never mind forge the sort of secret den that a sign would merit, in my room.  i also have a piece of paper where i have cunningly written "Rupert murdoch smells of wee".  The world is mine.
