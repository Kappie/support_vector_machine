We saw Marc hop down the branch and out of sight a while back (can't see him anymore) and Mom and dad still fly around some bushes and trees we have, but it's hard to see anything hiding there. Chances are good everyone is still somewhere in the backyard, at least for another day or two since they don't seem to be able to fly much and the parents are still watching over them (Still flying all over the place when we go to the backyard).   Vivaldi made his way to the middle of the apple tree since his prevoius branch swayed too much in the wind and he kept losing his balance - at least we can see him through our window. Funny, he doesn't seem to be scared of us at all, even when we're close. He even finds us boring, eventually starting to look at other things, even when we're a few feet from him to take a picture (make no mistake, mom and dad still scream at us when we do, they sure know that kids should stay away from strangers).  Well, I guess we better leave the little guy alone to get some sleep.
