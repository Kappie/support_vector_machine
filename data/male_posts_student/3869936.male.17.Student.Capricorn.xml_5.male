But there are somethings i just don't undertand like:  Like number for one thing, Take 3  6 right? Frist 6 is bigger then 3... but when it's spelled out(three  six), 3 just rocks six but 2 letters and that is fucking confusing.... I think we should just add so X's to the bac of it to straighten this shit out!  Then there is people.... When you runinto someone and say sorry for about 10seconds, you would think that they woldn't mind right. but noooooooo they have to go ahead and punch things. Fucking pricks!  Abnother thing is magic, Who the fuck came up with that, I'm sorry but i don't want to see a middle age dude pulling a rabbit out of his hat! that is just creepy and wrong in so many ways!    Yeps well i have bitch and complained quie enough, i must save some of that for other posts ya no? ok well todles!
