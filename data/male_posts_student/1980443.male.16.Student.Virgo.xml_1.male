We left at about 8:00 am or however early (too early actually).  I was excited to go cause I wanted to see all of my friends from the preceding year.  Well the retreat was going great, we had lunch, chapels, gametimes, freetimes and all sorts of stuff.  The day grew old, and there were gnats everywhere.  Oh man, I hated those gnats.  They were like really small little brothers, who kept trying to get closer and closer and closer to you until you just smacked them or something, then they'd always come back.  Gnats are like demerits, they're everywhere and they don't really serve a purpose.  (Just kidding by the way) Anyway, the gnat thing is another story, back to the silenced room.     It was time for the "Bonfire" inside of the building.  Mr. Harmless was giving a testimony when he told us about this witnessing oppurtunity the Lord placed in his life.  By the way, I loved all the testimonies, it's a great time as a school to grow closer.  Anyway, he's a funny guy right? So, he told us that this guy didn't have a single tooth in his whole head.  Everyone started to laugh, then right as soon as we started to laugh, he  said that the man hates Jesus Christ.  The room was silent except for a laugh by Christopher Thomas.  It was a good silence though, because it showed that we were concerned about the man.  How cold and unrevealed he was to the truth about Christ.  But the testimony went on and that was the most important thing.  That's about it, there's been other silencing times, but I couldn't think of one.  Love ya Anderson. Ms. Wiebe, that's (320 Words).  Oh yeah. That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
