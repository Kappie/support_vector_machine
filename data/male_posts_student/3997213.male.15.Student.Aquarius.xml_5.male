She picked up a bunch of Rugrats stuff for Riley. She loved that. Rachel had cheer camp and dad was out working on the lawn. I didn't do much really.I went in the pool for like 15 minutes but it was so cold for some reason. We went to Target after that. Riley spilled her bag of m's ALL over the floor at the register. (It's not the first time) I had to get down on my hands and knees in the middle of the store and pick up her m's. Real funny.  Dad lit a fire in our fire pit out back but I wasn't there long. I was working on a CD for Rachel. She wanted to buy the Usher Cd but I told her to save her money (correction: mom's money) and I made it for her. She was pretty happy and I was pretty happy that I was able to do the whole thing in a couple hours. (New record for me) Then she wouldn't stop playing "Confessions". Oh how I have grown sick of that song...and Usher. Big Brother came on at 9:00; watched that. I might have to work Hotdog day tomorrow for the adult softball league if it doesn't rain. I don't care either way. I'll also be done reading Jane Eyre tomorrow for school. I have about 3 chapters left. That's pretty exciting. I guess...
