Last Friday was easily the strangest day of my working experience.  First off, it's Friday.  This is usually a very, very busy day, what with people getting ready for...ah, whatever they do with lots of food on weekends, I don't know, because I'm WORKING. HAH HA! Take that, Errol Flynn.  Anyway, we're insanely slow this day, but not slow enough to send people home.  So Connie, the matronly cashier on the front end and I are going through an order with an older woman and her daughter.  Her younger, chubby daughter. Actually, that bulge doesn't look very much like fat.   Oh, Jesus, it's a pregnant woman, and she's saying her contractions are 5 minutes apart.    %(#$!!   What do you mean %(#$?   She's going to have her %(#$ing baby right here!  Ah, @#!.  Needless to say, she actually didn't pop there in the store, but asked me nicely if I'd take them out to the car and put them in for her.      %#*$ yes I will! Move, woman!  Hyah! Hyah!  I took the woman's cart and her mother took her own cart out, and of course, I finished first.      By the time I get this done she'll have had the baby!   $(%*!!!  But she finished and they took off.  Now I just hope they don't do something stupid like giving the kid my name just because they saw it on my nametag, yeesh.  The weekend went pretty much as planned, as business picked up for the Super Bowl.  We had a kid come in Sunday to get some snacks and stuff for a party he was having.  Of course, he was on the schedule to work about 2 hours later than when he was actually in the store, only he didn't know it, because the kid that had switched with him uh, forgot to TELL him.  So I got to hang around until the closing bagger (Usually plural) showed up, wished him luck, and went on home.  Not sure how that one's going to turn out, but they're not happy with them, that's for sure.  And for school, well, that's just weird.  We were supposed to have a test today, and it got canned because of the bad wintery weather death and destruction we had today, so I just didn't go to school at all.    And we were supposed to have read the first 25 chapters of Genesis for my World Lit class.  Whoa, easy there, teacher, nothing too exciting now.  If I read too much of it, I'll be begetting myself some unintentional naps.  Whoops.  And there's your HUGE FRICKIN' UPDATE, WHOO.
