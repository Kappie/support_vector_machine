It's the younger men with there GCSEs and IGCSEs that are first hit, then the ASs and A2s arrive in a vast modular deluge, and finally, near the end of term, the marathon AEAs will be upon us. It will be the last good-bye for 1/5th of the school as we move on, looking ever forward to University and the life beyond these walls.   "Hang on Mr. Bugson"  was an unashamed success.  The last night was deservedly packed (I'm told), and Si T. is reported to have said that it is the best home grown play produced at Win: Coll: in the last 30 years.  You can't get a greater recommendation than that.    This weekend the network was once again down.  Well, when I say network, I do mean internet access (the same thing to some).  I'm not sure I can remember a weekend when the net hasn't been down, to be frank.  It is a suspiciously regular outage, and the repetition suggests either malevolent divine intervention, or the work of a "hacker" (see  urlLink cracker ).  According to my logs the proxy server (a MS ISA box -- yes, it could just be the crappy OS) kicked the bucket at 22:10:50 on Friday evening.  For some reason it stopped responding to :8080, and didn't resume proxying function until Monday (today) morning - presumably when it was reset by a techy.  The reason why this 11:10pm is significant, is it's exactly 5 mins. before the proxy, or indeed  urlLink Websense , goes down for the night anyway.    The wonderful conspiracy theorist in me suspects the hands of a mortal are involved.  It would be beneficial (but completely antisocial) to someone if they seized control of the servers at this time.  They would then have unrestricted net access for 48+hours -- comp. dept. don't work over the weekend -- and they would be able to stop certain sections of the network from being switched off.  Yep, that's right, one of the silly servers switches the downlink ports on the Ciscos off - also at 11.15.  This prevents people from playing games, doing work, etc.  Of course it would be vastly more intelligent if certain protocols (and ports) were simply blocked at the switch level at 11:15 (so games couldn't be played) and then people could still retrieve their coursework from the fileserver.  Why have the expensive equipment if its useful features aren't used (perhaps Cisco switches don't support this sorta thing -- someone?)?  Network outages are still relatively common.  Probably the efforts of an 31337 kiddie in some house somewhere.  Of course it only upsets other Wykehamists, so why bother?  Oh that's right, computer geeks and teenagers (for that matter) are anti-social for the hell of it.  *Grunt*  Still no word on the suspended teachers.  Typical.  We're still waiting, Win: Coll:.
