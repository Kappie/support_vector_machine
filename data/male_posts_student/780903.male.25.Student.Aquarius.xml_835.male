I imagine to their disappointment, they're not finding any pictures, nor any video.  But, I figure to make up for that I could at least mention it again.  Ideally, I'd think of something funny to say about it, but I can't.  BUT DON'T LEAVE, people searching for Japanese gay porn -- you'll find a whole bunch of stuff here about Law School!  Which is not the same (although after reading "Brush With The Law," who knows what some people here are doing), but perhaps at least a little bit safer to be looking for on the Internet while you're at work.  I mean, if your boss sees you reading about the Law Review competition, that's a lot less likely to get you in trouble than if he sees you watching Japanese gay porn.  Depending on where you work, I guess.  [I'm crossing the poor taste line here, but: This is the biggest scandal among international baseball players since Byung-Hyun Kim sucked.  In the playoffs.  And blew.  Saves.  Forgive me.  I couldn't resist.]
