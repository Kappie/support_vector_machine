"  And these are both people that are planning on voting for Kerry.   The roar of enthusiasm is deafening.  I don't want to know why I shouldn't vote for Bush, as with any politician there are some things he does I support, and some things he's done that I don't support. Yes, overall I think he's done a decent job and I plan on voting for him at this point. However, if you're going to convince me to vote for someone else, you're going to have to do better than "Anybody but Bush" - it may be a winning strategy for some voters, but it certainly isn't catching fire with me.  This is just one more reason why I'm registered as an independent. I don't really support any party. I support the people who have ideals that are similar to mine and hope that they can carry them out to the best of their ability.  I was listening to representative Flake on the radio the other day and I think he had it about right. He basically said that he knows it's all a game and that everything in Washington is essentially a power play and a grab for money, but that if you go there knowing that you can do your best to influence things in favor of your ideas of right and wrong and hopefully make a small difference.  I think that's the best you can ever hope for from a politician in today's political environment; that they have ideals and values that you agree with and that they'll go to Washington and attempt to do their best to pass legislation that meets those ideals and values. You'll have to compromise, you'll have to make deals, and you'll probably have to do a few things you'd rather not in order to get support for things that are more important to you. But that's life in American politics. It's been like that since the very beginning of our country and it's not likely to change anytime soon.
