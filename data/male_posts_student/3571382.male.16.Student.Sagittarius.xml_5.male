Jason said it was like the best movie he's seen in a long time and Tommy didn't really like it. I thought it was OK, worth the money but not much more than that.    Once again it started out as a sunny day and now I hear thunder.  Why does the weather have to suck so much?  I enjoy Galaga wayyyyy too much.  Yes, Galaga as in the 80s arcade game.  Tommy has it at his house and I'm like obsessed with it.  In other news frozen Ding Dong snacky things are extremely good.  Some other things that are going on in my mind right now: -Whoever posts comments as anonymous and enjoys using the word 'cunt' needs to find a constructive way to use their limited comical talents. -It's been too long since I kissed a girl -I really like to think and have alone time. -I like music a lot. -Thursday is probably one of the best bands ever. -Cursive is my new favorite band.  Yeah, I added a shoutbox, try not to have too much fun with it.  Laterrrrr.
