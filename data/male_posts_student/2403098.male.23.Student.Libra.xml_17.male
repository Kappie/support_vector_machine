But seriously, it was just one of those days where I had nothing to write.  I actually sat here and tried for a few seconds before I got bored and ate crackers instead.  I had nothing to contribute yesterday, nothing to even bring to the table, kinda one of those days in general.  So it wasn't even something blogger should take personally, as it was true for my life as well.   I am gonna promise myself that one day, I'll pick a topic, and I'll write about it.  That might be cool, because as it is apparent, I kinda ramble.  You know what though, that pretty much seems therapeutic in it's own right.  I just kinda float from one thing to the other, sounding like I'm mad at everything.  LIFE is SATIRE though, it's fun, it's obnoxious, and anyone who can see it through the same vantage points as I.. is in with me.  You see, I had to come to this conclusion because I start to feel bad sometimes.. thinking about how I get so negative in tone.  In all actuality, I'm quite positive in my mind, but shit!  It's like how the funniest comedians make fun of the simplest things that allows people to say in their head "I KNOW, I hate that too!!"  or "I know, it's so true, I always feel that way on an escalator too!"  Whatever that feeling might be.. who knows.  Scared, excited, aroused, whatever.  I personally have no feelings towards escalator.. only that if they're broken, I REFUSE to go up them.  I will NOT participate in using a broken escalator.  Are you joking me?  It's like I'm letting that f*er win.  Right, I'm gonna just let you sit there broken and still do all the work.  NO!  Do your damn job, or get OUT of the mall.  Back to me.  So my conclusion is, I over-negativize (made it up, go with it) things, cause that's how I can make mundane tasks, people, situations, etc, funny in my own mind and hopefully touch lives at the same time.  NOT through my blogspot (God, give me some credit, I'm not claiming people read this and it touches people) but rather.. just in general.  If one person hears the comments I make under my breath in class when that stupid whore at the front of the class asks stupid questions, and they are touched by it.. then so be it.  If not, I've made my day more pleasurable, and hell I'll touch MYSELF for it.  Hmmm, so I've wasted this much time explaining to myself, basically, why I love to make fun of everything.  So lets stop the time wasting and make fun of something.  What topic to choose.  OH who knows, maybe I have nothing important to say today.. or ever.  Lets face it, I'm not the most creative person, I'm not the most witty, and not even the most smartest!  "Most smartest?  MOST smartest?  That's real nice Loretta, real nice."  Gotta love Loretta.  What am I talking about?  Shit- I'm talking about a nap.  This was the worst entry into any journal (electronic, or otherwise) EVER.  I'm gonna just lay here and watch The Price is Right.  Class was boring (AND early) so a nap will come soon.  One final note:  BLOGGER should incorporate the words BLOGSPOT and BLOGGER into it's spell checking system, so that it doesn't have "no suggestions" for those two VERY relevant words.
