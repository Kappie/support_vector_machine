So yeah was gonna go to Mid Valley yesterday..needed to get some things and check out those interior decorating showrooms for my other crib..but went and made like two circles around Mid Valley but all the aprking entrances were like all blocked off cause they were all full...Zones G,H,J I don`t think were full yet..but alotta cars trying to get there so decided nah..So went to Bangsar Shopping Center (BSC) instead..cant wait for the under - construction parts of Mid Valley open..there should be lotsa more parking..but then again more people! *gulp!* .yikes.And there was no traffic jam outside Mid Valley even..though maybe lotsa cars..haha..  Ok went there and checked out Bofi which is fittings for a kitchen.Its nice.Very nice.According to mom one set alone is like rm80000...giler ker...but I have to admit its all very beautiful..so hopefully can get??  Then went for lunch...got some Singapore Yee Mee which wasnt bad but can tahan la..got Espirit..hadnt had in ages..its more expensive than I thought! rm6.80!haha but I charged it all to dad so no probs =D .LoL.  Saw Sheila Majid like outside Guardian...Shein is right..she is Sheila Majid`s height!I didn`t belive it at first actually!And she looks so different..not as glamourous or as fair as she is when she`s performing but of course that`s normal isn`t it?Who wants a legion on fans mobbing you while your at the mall?Hey everyone`s human!
