Seriously, I'm doing work for the office (reading the book on the Provincial Nominee Program), and they tell me to vacuum.  Then, all I say to them is this: "What should I do?  Read and understand now, and then vacuum while I'm sleepy.  Or vacuum now and read when I'm sleepy and not understand a word!!!"  Well, that's what I was trying to say, until my dad goes all apoplectic (or "high blood" in that accent of theirs).  Seriously!!!  They're such hypocrites too!  They tell you to do one thing, and you see them go and do the exact opposite.  One example that I love to site is drinking to the point of being absolutely pissed (camping, oy!), well, if you expect me not to drink when I trun 18, or now come to think of it, why don't you set the good example and not drink?!  And then their criticisms "Oh you should reduce"  when (A) They're stuffing their own faces and (B) They're the ones that got you started with the "Eat Eat, C'mon you're not full, Eat!".  Seriously, sometimes, I wish they would jus assimilate into western culture.  Even though I'm so opposed to cultural assimilation, I think it would actually do my parents some good.   I'm getting sick of the "back home" stories.  Like, yes, even though it might not seem like I appreciate it, I love this country and everything that I have, but they expect you to be so selfless about it all the time that what they'd want would be close to life in a convent!  I went through a refugee experience, it may have only been a glimpse into what it's really like, but it changed me, and they have no right to tell me that I'm ignorant about the world.  Why do you think that I'm working in the consituency office of the best advocate for immigration in the province?  Why do you think I'm reading up on the Provincial Nominee Program?  It's so more people can come to Canada and have what I have.  They're expectations for how we're supposed to act are far too high.  We're kids, why can't they understand that we DO appreciate what we have, but we don't have to show it ALL THE TIME.  I'll leave you readers with one word: Oy!!!
