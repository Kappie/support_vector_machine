I can't forget the memories dat the grp had, but i know i must forget this and carry on.   This is becoming a burden to me, not something which encourages me.It's just pulling me back...far too many times....   And, my classmates are pretty cool guys....tot they were just hi bye friends, but their characters are far much better den those in the grps....they give me the feel of respect, and the feeling which i have known them for yrs.....perhaps, i was fated to meet them for a purpose?....perhaps perhaps....life's full of surprises, isn't it?      i have a much different view on pple now....SERIOUSLY, looks dun matter at all to me now......it's the characters....   so pple may look normal or ugly...but they have very gd characters.....and they make gd friends...so dun judge a book by it's cover...   and singaporean gals....most of them are so materialistic...so difficult to find one who really likes you because of your characters , and not your money,looks...etc   still looking for the one..................maybe it's not time yet....
