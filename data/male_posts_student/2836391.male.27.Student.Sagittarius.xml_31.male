The chosen DVD was "Love, Actually", a romantic comedy. Now, anyone who knows me would say that I hate romantic comedies. I've never been overly interested in watching them, and will go out of my way to avoid them. But, suprisingly, I actually enjoyed this one. It was interesting as we watched, seeing how the stories developed, and how the characters were feeling in their various situations. Funnily enough, most of us could relate to the way they were feeling at some time or another. Interestingly I see that  urlLink Rach  also watched the same movie on Sunday night, and had a different opinion altogether.
