WHY ?!?!  come on!  every girl who  wants  to use a tampon knows which kind she's gonna buy... or she doesnt really care and just buys whatever she picks up first... so  why do we have tampon commercials ?!  and yeah i know the "tv people" try and put  girly  commercials with the  girly  tv shows... but really... do they think that i wanna see those silly tampon commercials when i'm watchin CSI?  uhhhh... how bout not!  oh and then there's those bra commercials.  like the Victoria's Secret ones.  now do i really need to be seein a bunch of girls in their bras talkin bout how "comfortable" they are and how much "support" they offer.  i mean  PLEASE !  i dont wanna know!  and i mean honestly... when they make those Victoria's Secret commercials are they makin them  only  for women?  or do they have guys in mind too?  sex sells... remember?  oh yeah... and i  think  that most girls probably already have decided what kinda bra they're gonna where?  why do we need commercials about them?  girls  ALREADY  buy them... who else are they tryin to sell bras too...  huh ?!  so the bottom line?  can we just cut all these  girly  commercials... there is really no point for them.  they are just  waaaaaaaaaaay  too much info.  goodness... just please  spare me .     my iTunes  >>   urlLink Beyond The Sea
