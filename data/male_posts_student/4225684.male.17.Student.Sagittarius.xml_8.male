I felt my lungs pumped, my mind energized but most importantly, i felt my heart beat once more.  The emotion that im speaking of is undescribable.. Have you ever felt happiness just by looking at the wide grin on that face? Have you ever felt joy by just hearing that laugh so innocent yet jovial? Has your spirits ever been raised by a companion who does so little but yet it seems so much?  I sure am glad that i have found this emotion once again. Be it temporary or permanent, it sure was a great relief from many other emotions i have been experiencing lately. Though i hope for it to last, the sad chorus from november rain - Guns and Roses of "Nothing lasts forever" just keeps playing.. Well forever is a long long time, and i know that on my part, forever will seem like just another day as long as i continue to experience and feel this emotion i am so grateful to feel...     "An Angels carress, so gentle yet full of feeling. A Demons words, so little yet full of fearing. Light from heaven fills my day, Dark from hell blinds my way. A child so innocent, so happy, so pure. How i wish, i hadn't learnt to adore......"
