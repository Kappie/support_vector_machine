Then some more people showed up and we all spent the day raking leaves at her parent's house.  Her father is very sick and her mother has been too preoccupied with him to be able to take care of their yard (understandable).  Then we came inside and had a little bit of a dinner, and I came home to shower so I could meet up with a friend of mine from High School (Jason) and his wife.  We've lived in the same city for about a year now, and this is the first time we're getting together... sad, huh?  Well, we had a blast.  When I got there, Kat (short for Kathryn) had made taco-type stuff for dinner, so we enjoyed that while talking a little bit... then the games commenced!  We played cards like crazy, and like it was going out of style.  We played an interesting game called "Unexploded Cow"... you really have to play it to understand it, and then we played "Spoons" and then Egyptian Rat Screw, which I had not played since High School in band class on days our director was sick or decided to give us a break, etc.  Then we watched a movie to enjoy his new surround sound system.  The second Matrix movie.  Unfortunately, by this time it was 11:00 and I was a little tired from the days events so I dozed on and off during the movie... thankfully, I'd seen it before.  The movie ended, I said my departing good-byes, and came home, and here I am now, typing in my blog.  Good blog.  Safe blog.  Well, gotta go to bed to get some sleep.  Tomorrow's another busy day.
