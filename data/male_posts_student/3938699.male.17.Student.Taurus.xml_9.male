During one of her tests, she attatched electrodes to a cupcake, so by attempting to touch it, Bart would get a sudden shock. He grabbed it, got shocked, then did it several other times. Bart did not realize that even though the cupcake would be tastey, it only hurt him.  That is my relationship with Jackie in a nutshell. I think to myself, 'hey, she's a pretty gal with a great deal of wisdom and knowledge on her head. A relationship is possible and would yeild good things for me'. Yet every time I tried to get close, every time I showed interest in her, she stung me. Either by claimed to want a platonic friendship, or just ignoring me.     "you know that feeling you get deep in your stomach when someone you care about betrays you?"
