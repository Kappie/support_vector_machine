It was written by  urlLink Max Lucado  and Sergio Martinez and is called "You are Still Precious in His Eyes." The basic line of it is as follows:     There once was a little town on a little hill far far away. On the the little hill were little people called wimmicks. The wimmicks would give sticker stars and sticker dots as they cared. They stuck stars on to the wimmicks that they thought were talented or better than others, and dots on the wimmicks that achieved nothing, or did something bad or non-productive.     Anyway, there was one particular wimmick who's name was Punchinello. Punchinello was often raking in grey dots because he could not jump high, or run fast. He did not look good or have any talent. So, all the other wimmicks took their gray dots out of their little storage boxes and gave them to him.     One day, Punchinello found a wimmick that did not have any dots or stars. Some admired that wimmick for not having any dots, so they stuck a star on her. Some did just the opposite.  However, none of the stickers stayed on the wimmick. They just fell off.    Punchinello even went further when he say this wimmick and asked why the stickers fell off. She said "I go to see the woodcarver everyday. I spend time with him, and he teaches me to not care about the stickers." Punchinello soon left and went to see the woodcarver.     The woodcarver was a large, magnificent man. He cared for all the little wimmicks.  (to make a long story short): Puncinello talked to him, and the woodcarver gave Punchinello a pep talk about whatever other people think of him. It doesn't matter. "You are all very special in my eyes." As Punchinello walked out of the woodcarver's shop a sticker fell off.   The End   Think about what it all means. If people are making marks on you, then talk to God.
