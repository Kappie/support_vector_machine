Tiger Army has such a distinctive sound, and Nick 13 has an instantly recognizable voice. I don't know why, but the mellow psychobilly fits perfectly with this summer.   Psychobilly: what a weird word.  Today I had to work, which was extremely boring, especially considering my mother + grandma were gone, and I wasn't working with either John or Bryce. Basically, I listened to my iPod and listened to Lewis tell long-winded, self-indulgent stories. Anyway, that was better than actually working so I just nodded my head and kept starring cheese.  Sadly, Chris has to work tomorrow night, so we won't be doing anything. Also, Bryce is going camping so I won't have anywhere to stay. I guess we could go to a movie or something, John?  Not much in the news today, beyond the usual mundane DNC speech recaps and Michael Moore. Now, I am a liberal, just like Mike, but this guy is an  attention whore . He says he will be filming in Florida on Election Day to make sure every eligible Floridian gets their chance to vote. I imagine Mike views himself as some sort of liberal superhero juggernaut, and when he comes to town the right shakes and looks for places to hide their dirty laundry. I doubt a few cameras will stop Katherine Harris if she wishes to hand Florida over to George like in 2000. There was  plenty  of coverage of it in 2000, but everyone was unaware of W's power to really  fuck things up , so they decided hey, its only an election. Another will come around in four years, and by then the Reagan Revolution will have gained so much steam that it will have crushed the communist atheist liberal baby-killers.  Well, that wandered a little off course. So just let me say that I support Mike's efforts to mobilize the left (and moderates, and right, and anyone that will listen to him), but he could go about it in a more legitimate way. I am pretty liberal, but even I had to admit that some of the stuff in  Fahrenheit 9/11  was a stretch.   But enough balanced political discourse. Let us talk about me, for a change. Well, I am doing about the same as usual. No big changes, but my faith in the summer epiphany still stands. After all, I still have a whole month to think, before I go back to Conformity High.   Haven't seen a number of the gang in a while. For a couple weeks, I was sick of everybody, but time apart has made me feel more forgiving towards others. I'm looking forward to resuming normal relations with everyone.  It is kind of depressing that I have had such a wasteful summer. However, I feel that I have not yet fully recovered from the last school year, so just drifting around seems like an honest enough use of my time, for now.   I'd like to return to work for a moment. I am not exactly a "people person," by which I mean that I hate meeting new people, being in large social situations, and pretending to like said people in said situations. People come and go at the Dairison, due to drug use, stealing, and sheer incompentence. Today I had to work with the new girl. Now I'm sure that she is a good person, seemed nice, not exactly well-read but who is in Garrison? This didn't stop me from doing my sacred duty. This duty, of course, was instigating Operation "Total Dick."   Let me interject quick with a brief Op. description. "Total Dick" is my way of alienating people that I have no wish to talk to. During the school year, I use a slightly modified Operation I call "Iron Curtain," in which I respond to the people I don't want to talk to with silence and one-word answers. However, during the summer, I have much more self-esteem due to not always being told that I am wrong, so I actively search to alienate people I don't ever want to talk to/see again.   So, as the name suggests, I be a total dick. It is quite simple. I don't dislike these people, I just don't want to talk to them, especially the majority of my work colleagues. I am there to work (well, really to drink coffee and read the  Tribune ), and I don't need friendships to get in the way of my robotlike efficency.   Long story short, it worked quite well due to my loud banging on things, wearing sunglasses all day and ignoring her, and insinuating that Dairy Queen work was below me. It isn't, but it works better if people think that it is.   A side note: don't try this shit at home. A time or two during the school year, "Iron Curtain" backfired  horribly  on me. It isn't too hard to realize that my avoidance was not schoolboy coquettishness, but an actual aversion to social contact. And sometimes, you alienate people so badly that they think you are actually a total dick, and not just trying to avoid small talk. Case in point: my mom and sister.  Well, somewhere in these operations I am sure I learned a lesson. Anyway, Lupin is on.
