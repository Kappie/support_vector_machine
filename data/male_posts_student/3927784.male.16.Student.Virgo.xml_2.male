Also, i was at my Nan and Grandads 50th Wedding Anniversary yesterday, so i thought i'd use that to produce a subject about old folks in general.    Now yesterday, i was deciding whether or not to cut shave my head, and i've decided.............not to. You know why? Because i'm now working at Safeway. Yes they got back to me and said that next Saturday i've got an induction day there. Actually, they told me this yesterday, but if i told you then, then i wouldnt of had anything to write about except that immaturity thing. So now i'm happy because i honestly didnt think that i was going to get it. Yay!   A good source of mine just told me that our timetable next year at college is a bit dodgy. Apparently, the lessons are all between 1hr 10 and 1hr 35. Is it just me or do you think their getting off on making lessons longer and making us suffer. Yeah Cadbury, people are really gonna wanna become students their when you make it pants! Hopefully someone will step in and say "Dont you think this is a bad idea". I'm hoping!   So like i said, i was at an anniversary party at my aunts house. I didnt think she knew what she was letting herself in for saying she'd hold it there, because my Grandad invited about 40 people. And they werent young people either, they werent in their 60's/70's/80's. So you wouldnt imagine it to be fun, but i wasnt there to have fun, if i wanted fun i'd go to a stripclub, lol. So anyway, just by looking at them, i thought i'd write a little something dedicated to them.     Now when you look at old people, you think they've been that age all their life, and because we're only young, we havent see what  they  looked like young. Do we even know that they have been young. Yeah we've seen photos of our grandparents in their prime, but anyone could take a photo out of a magazine. Ok, i'm just being stupid here, but ya never know.   Anyway, when your on a bus, theres the odd one or two that come upstairs and you just worry that they are going to fall down the stairs when their coming up or going down and do their hip in.   And can you picture yourself when your their age. It'll be wierd. One day your like "i've still got 30 more years left in me", then BAM you've just snapped your back which just halved your life expectancy. At least we're young, we've got years to go yet. You never know either, they might invent something to prevent death in the elderly. I wouldnthave it though, people die fora reason, and i'd know when my time is up. I wouldnt wanna stay here forever and ever because it would get boring.   So what would you say is an OAP's enemie? Kids, maybe? Or deathand accidents? I'm gonna go with chaffas (for definition check out  urlLink www.chavscum.co.uk ). I cant wait till chaffas get old and see what its like to getmugged by the next generation of chaffas. But you gotta love old people though.   Ok, at this point i dont know why i decided to write about old people because i've ran out of ideas and points to make about them. So i think that this is just as good a point as any to end it and get onto the next subject, Sundays!     Sundays? What the hell! Yes its from one bad subject to another, but i thought i'd share my views on Sundays with the rest of you. I love Sundays, because a lot of people have the day off, and i like it when people have the day off because they get to do the odd jobs around the house and just relax. Now for me, its just the relaxing part because i dont have jobs to do until i start work at Safeway. (New word alert! Chill + Relax = Chillax) So how do i spend my time on a Sunday. Well personally i prefer winter sundays to summer sundays, because its cold outside and you can spend the day inside in the warm, but with summer sundays, its warm outside and you feel that your wasting a day lying in bed, so you gotta get up and do something. But in my case, i still sleep anyway because i've got nout better to do. Now i'd like some feedback at this point telling me how you would usually spend a winters sunday, and i'll carry on with this.....next sunday, obviously - providing the amount of feedback i get. Otherwise i'll write about something else.     On the same story, i'm considering cutting the amount of times i write on this site because theni can put more stuff into one instead of spreading it out throughout the week, and i'll have more ideas for future entrys. But i'm not gonna do this till after this week because no doubt i'll have nothing to do.     Ok, so i'm getting onto the next topic now, and that is the top ten things that irritate me the most, because i had so much fun doing the immaturity ranking that i thought i'd do it about something else. Today will be the first 2, and throughout the rest of the week another 2 will be announced. Notice i'm just putting things back today. So here we go with number 10:     10) Not having anything to eat in the house:  Now this just really gets my back up (Note: I've never used that phrase before). When i'm hungry and i want something to eat, and i get into the kitchen and theres absolutely nothing to eat, i get angry! All there is is........cheese.....and bread.......and salad. Yeah i know what your thinking, why dont i have a cheese and salad sandwich or something...but i cant have that everytime i'm hungry. Also, i like to cook, and when theres nothing that i can cook with i get pissed off easily!     9) Being bored : I hate being bored simply because theres nothing to do. I seriously gotta find something to do with my life so i dont get bored ever again. Theres nothing worse than watching the hours go past. Usually on weekends i get up late, and then in the holidays i say to myself that i should get up early because its a waste of a day, but then what is the point of me getting up if theres nothing to do!  Come back tommorow for 8 and 7.    -Peace-
