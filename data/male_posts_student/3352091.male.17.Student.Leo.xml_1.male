I dont know if its because i have a new sense of life and a new chance to start over from scratch or if i was just unusually giddy today.        "From the moment we depart       We never know where the beginning began or        The end did start" Ahh. to be able to breath breathe anew and feel my soul take flight to the heavens above. The stars are the limit as the first step of an impossible journey begins and becomes possible. For is that not what life is, a journey?
