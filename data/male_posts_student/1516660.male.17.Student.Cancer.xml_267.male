Father picked us up at 8am. We managed to get to be the head of the queue.      We went to eat at the coffeeshop near the clinic. We three ate kueh chap. Moo meow!! After that, we went back to wait for my turn. I read my book (Clues to Harry Potter), I still haven't finished it yet. Oh moo meow!   The doctor diagnosed my chest pains as eating too much ice. Something like the coldness constrict blood flow/artieries/veins. Something like that la. Due to bulk ordering of medicines, the total fees came up to $125. O.O!  Oh yes, Mother brought taufu back to cook. You see ar, the person packaged it in a incorrect way. He just put the taufu into a small read plastic bags. The edges could cut into the taufu and split them apart!!! The correct way should put the taufu into clear plastic bags full of water (like how you put small fishes). Therefore, we have to hold the taufu in our palms, and cannot hold it like how you hold a plastic bag normally. Yeah... and I have to guard the taufu in the backseat, to prevent it from being squashed/cut/damaged. Yes.   After the visit to the doctor's we went to some plant greenhouse in Jalan Kayu. They wanted to buy some kak (those orange thingys) plants, which are going on an offer, $18 instead of $48. Well, one glance can tell why they placed them on offer. The plants were so small and puny...some dead, some very young. Not very ideal. Yeah..We managed to get two plants that don't look so bad. The first one we picked was of excellent quality (we found out that it was placed accidentally in that section, and should be sold for $48. HaHa! We got lucky!). We also brought this bamboo thingys. Those got tiers one. It's supposed to be very lucky. We brought one three-tiered for $5. It's the ONLY one that none of the bambboos died (and you wonder the cheapness of the price).   We have to load it into the taxi. We placed it on the space between the front seats and the back seat (where u put your feet). During the jounrney back home, I had to put my feet on the two pots, pressing them down so they won't fall onto the back seat. I am also trying to read my book and look after the taufu. I am so busy!         After that, we went back, relax a bit, and went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. I ate chicken rice. After that, Dad went to the bank to exchange new notes (for hongbaos la). Mother was angry at him for some reason (I know but I don't wanna tell).   I came back and started to clean the floor lor. I vaccumed first, then mopped the floor. HaHa. My first time vaccuming and mopping. So tiring! I was sweating like shit. Ha! I didn't vacuum properly, because of the stupid rotating thingy la. HaHa. :P anyway. HaHa.   After that, I went online surfing. Most qi shu lin things happened. MSN Messenger and Neopets decided to go on maintence, leaving me nothing to play with (more of Neopets.... MSN no cats online) . HaHa. I ate dinner, and the taufu taste a bit strange (probably left in the car for so long). Hmm...  I was almost being chased by a bisexual that XC got to knew. Let's just said he fled upon seeing my pic. HAHA! I dunnoe why he wants to chase after me in the first place? The way I speak is nice meh? O.O How intriguing.  Okay le. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
