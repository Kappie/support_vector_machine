I actually slept during his lecture-discussion of the poem "Kung Tag-Ani"...when he was discussing the last two stanzas I just couldn't resist and let my eyes droop into stupor...It was the first time a teacher made me sleep this sem...hehehe...  I'm gonna maintain two blogs now...I will be having another one setup on livejournal...just click this link if you want to visit it...http://www.livejournal.com/~easternoracle/  no doc mara next week and for the next next week...well, we will have "one of his colleagues" as ma 21 teacher so I think its nice having a change, I do hope he/she is fine though...anyway, nadelay na din ang long test namin and he'll be giving out sample exams daw...  um...this is all folks!!!
