I tried all these programs to get rid of it and none of them worked. I ended up finding a forum post about it that helped. I had to close the damn thing down because it was running in my processes menu, so with that done I used my AVG and it deleted the damn thing. Now I can finally get back onto DALnet on IRC!  I decided not to go out and do anything interesting tonight. I just have people over so, the "chill session" can get underway I suppose. Sodzy is suppose to bring Mystic River, but whenever he decides to get his ass back to Westfort from Current River, we are watching nothing but television. (I have no movies I want to watch)  Mmm, the sweet sound of Crystal Method. I have had their music on for about 2 hours now. Such awesome tunes, electronica music truly rocks. Whenever I have extreme techno stuff like that on it stimulates my thinking mode. I feel so eccentric and curious right now. I never understood why the hell it makes me feel so  "thoughtful" , but it does.  I realized today how much I have changed over the past few years. I used to think so cynically, when I honestly never really had a reason too. Besides my parents divorcing back in 1999, I had everything a normal pre-teen would have. Maybe it was the whole  hormonal  thing that was going on. Chemical inbalances and what not. I used to feel so bitter inside, and I didn't necessarily show it on the outside. It came out in huge rage modes though, and I remember those so clearly.  Essentially, however, I have opened my eyes and realized a lot of things about life. I know I am 17, but my perspective differs from so many my age. In a way it's kind of good, I feel a uniqueness to myself - but in a way it's frustrating. I am unable to express a lot of my thoughts  feelings to others, simply because:                     a)  They don't understand                    b)  They don't  WANT TO  understand  That I guess I can,  or better yet , have to deal with. I guess I can handle that though, because sooner or later they'll grow up too, hopefully. I wonder about a lot of people I know, even some good friends of mine. I guess it depends on what they want to learn from life, and I do believe at some point in everyone's lives, we  DO  want to get  something  from life.  Life is such a beautiful thing, if it is looked at in perspective. So many wonderful things happen, and will happen in life. Most people think so negatively about life. But, life is much more than bad things, people tend to dwell on them however, which you can't blame anyone for; it's human nature. It is however, possible, to break that habit and focus on positive things in life. In order to do that however you must want to be more optimistic. :)  Is it worth the stress and pain to worry about something bad?  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Later guys.
