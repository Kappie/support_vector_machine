Been here since the last 20 Hours,a routine which has become common over the last few weeks.Our Team is overburdened with work and we have been trying our best to finish it.                       I suddenly feel like a Alien.Its been several weeks since I have seen TV/Listened to Music/Read a Book ( A routine so normal to me until a few weeks ago when I used to listen to at least two Cassettes/CD's a day and read a Book a day ).Work is like Season.It comes in Cycles.
