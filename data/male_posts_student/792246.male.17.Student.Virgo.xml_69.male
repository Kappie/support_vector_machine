You're the essential schoolbag accessory for every magical girl; you're probably sitting on the bishounen's shoulder; you hang around the base and provide comic relief from the mecha pilots; and once an episode you get squished by the Villain. You've somehow become necessary for every self-respecting anime series, although your plot functions are negligible. We all hate you, you know.   urlLink  Which generic anime character are you?
