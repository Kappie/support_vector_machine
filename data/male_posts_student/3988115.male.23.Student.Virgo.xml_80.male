No, they're not great literature. No, they don't make for the most challenging of reading. And no, calling yourself a "collector" doesn't allow you to escape the shame that you should feel at reading comics as an adult. However, I for one have never loved comics so much that I thought I should try my hand at writing one, or even  urlLink publishing it online . This gentleman's comic is less like the Sunday comic or the super-hero comic, and more like the comics they hide deep in the Dallas Observer...only not as good. But please browse his site and read a few. They may grow on you.
