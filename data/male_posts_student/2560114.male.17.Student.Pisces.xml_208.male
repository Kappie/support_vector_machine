This episode could either end in a good way or a bad way depending on the outcome of cif...still though, not everything is settled wit her...it still hasnt came to itz closure, it still hasnt come to an end...durin this episode it was battle to stop the pain and to stop those feelinz...it lookz like ive failed to do that...still tryin to look for that special someone...the sage contineuz...hope u ready for the next episode.
