Hemma bloody promised to go to school at 215, to have a talk with Siti Hawa, for the  gong.  She did not turned up. I was in the prefect room, with all the kids around, and looked like a total idiot to sit there doing nothing. At 245, I gave up, and went to Siti Hawa alone. She was eating. Talked to her, and she told me the  gong  is not with her, after looking at my puzzled/worried face, she finally told me, to see her Monday or Tuesday to comfirm. Went back and brother told me someone called. I called Hemma and, argh, I'm sick of her. Can't she ever tell me earlier when she knew she can't turned up? Bah. Whatever. I went online at 300, and whatever. So sick of it. Soon, Tiktsin came online, and I talked to him. He got pissed, lolx. And I told him I'm sick of everything and there he goes, yada yada yadaing around. I know I shouldn't tell him, because everything will naturally goes back to Santhi. Bah. Who cares. He was seriously pissed, but who cares. Haahaa. What so ever lar.   I've been crying over small matters nowadays. Almost everyday, my tears dropped. I mean, most of the time is about prefects. I'm being dramatic, yeayea, I know I know. Bah, so? What so ever.  Anyway, I'm starting to love  Georgia.  Heehee. And wow, since when I can change font here? And add up pictures, and and, everything. lolx! Laalaalaa. Brother brought back one big bix of Anime, and asked me whether I like Anime or not. -_-" I was like "Depends lar" -_-" Laalaa. He might want to use the Pc later. *yawns* Need to wake up before 700 and need to reach school by 700. Hope Hemma doesn't come late  again,  or inform me if she can't come or any changes of plan. And pray hard Ganapathy bought all the stuffs we need for the banner tomorrow and the stick from Iggy. And I'm not very prepared, but need to be prepared to get voiced from Santhi tomorrow. Tt said he will back me up. lolx. He thought he is the great? No comment. *Take a deep breath* I'm prepared, to get scold. Oh well, maybe I'll still write or..cry after that. =P Hey, that's  me . Beh.  No idea how long I need to get rid of that bloody banner. Hmm.. and how many times we need to rehears. Hmm.. Because of this, I need to change my piano class to Tuesday at 600, hope I wont forget. And need to fnish up my Theory, plus practice. I did not touch my piano for, like one bloody week. I just can't make myself move. Like what my tuition teacher said, mind is suppose to control our body, but our body is controlling our mind. *slaps* Lalala. And I just found that, I can't get anything from bab6, Addmaths. I did not pay attention lately, which is kind of abnormal. And did not fnish the whole bab of homeworks. Laze is seriously dragging me around and I just can't make my body move. Bah!
