Just had a Psychology lesson this morning about motivation. Well..as usual there are many scholls of thought with varying degrees of belief but the common thing is CHANGE happens only within ourself. Or, to put it in a more easy manner to understand, we can only decide for ourselves whether we want to change or not. Stimulus from the environment, eg. constant nagging from parents, can only provide a keyhole.  We must open the door ourselves .  Speaking of which, I have  TONS  of work to do and no time to waste! Have to stop now!
