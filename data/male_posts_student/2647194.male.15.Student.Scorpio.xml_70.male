All 9 pages of text, 2 pages of outline, 1 page of title, 1 page of works cited, and 1 page from the packet. 14 pages total of english crap, and supposedly/hopefully this paper rocks. Its called: "The History and Roots of American Jazz", quite a hefty topic.  Here's what happened today in school while I was wishing I was outside on the bike:  Math: We're doing parametric equations right now, if anyone knows what the hell that is. Its breaking normal equations into two parts, an X part and a Y part, both of which are functions of T after this transformation. weird.  Science: I got a 61/65 on the test. not too bad.  Band: blah blah blah, working towards the concert, what else is to say?  Spanish: Sustic got pissed, but I doubt she'll end up doing anything about that paper-wedge throwing the other day. As for the field trip tommorow to Boca Chica, I deemed it unworthy of my time and money, and purposely forgot the slip. My time is better spent avoiding having bio and math homework than eating a frickin Mexican buffet at 10:00 in the morning. I mean, what the hell are they going to serve, eggs w/jabanero peppers? french toast with rice and curry? I don't think so...  English: Paper's done! Paper's done! Now its time for that deadline to whoosh by! Need I say more?  Social: More current events crap, more notes, and more US soldiers dead in fucking Iraq. I'm so sick of hearing about that place...  And I won't go on a rant about the unjustness of the Iraqi war. Not now.  Instead of finishing up with a lyric, which Dylan deemed pointless (lol), I'll end with yet another quote of mine.  "Half the time in life when you think you're being rejected, you're really rejecting yourself."
