(it helps that she's really cute too). so yeah, they were very friendly and humble. the elder who did the sermon was obviously a lay fellow, but he did a pretty good job. the meeting was definately different. the funny thing was that when we were singing hymns, chelan and i sang better than all of them...and we had never sang or heard any of these songs before. they were almost two measures off from the music at times. the elder, in his sermon, even joked about how bad their singing was. another thing that i found was interesting was that contra the rumors i heard about them disbelieving the book of mormon, the elder spoke of christ visiting the americas as an actual event.    new song   "are you gonna live your life wonderin’ standing in the back lookin’ around? are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you’ve grown up or how you missed out? things are never gonna be the way you want. where's it gonna get you acting serious? things are never gonna be quite what you want. or even at 25, you gotta start sometime. i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around? are you gonna waste your time? gotta make a move or you'll miss out. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. stick around nostalgia won't let you down. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight."  -praise chorus,  urlLink jimmy eat world
