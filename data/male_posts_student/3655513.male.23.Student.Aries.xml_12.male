Phrases such as "The Eagle has landed" and "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" were embedded into popular culture and folklore, and it was proclaimed that a new age was born. As with any event of this magnitude, there was controversy a-plenty to accompany. For years, left-wing extremists accused the government of the United States of abandoning domestic problems to sink resources into the space program, while right-wing extremists took hold of that same issue but claimed money would have been better used arming soldiers in Vietnam. Conspiracy theorists would grab hold of this moment and find their theories of government manipulation of the masses vindicated (at least in their own minds) by claiming the whole event was staged and televised in a New Mexico desert. What one generation will remember as a whole though is watching in utter awe the unification (in general) of a nation behind one dream, one goal.  Where is that unification now? What did landing a man (or men) on the moon attain for us in the long run?  In related news, Joe Schmoe 2 was the most entertaining thing on television tonight.  Shalom.  Rooster
