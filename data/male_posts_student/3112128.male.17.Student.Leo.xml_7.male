I knew about Bush's business links with the Saudis, the Bin Laden's, with Halliburton, Enron and many others. I knew that Ashcroft lost an election to a dead man, but because of the American system, he got put in Bush's government anyway. I knew that George W. Bush often makes a mockery of his speeches, because of his previous alcohol and cocaine abuse. I knew that only one congress man had a child serving in Iraq and I knew that the vast majority of congress men and women did not read the patriot act before they passed it. I knew that Bush sat for nearly seven minutes after being told that America was under attack, not doing so much as stand to react or even talk. I knew that this war was about money and it was fought for the rich, by the poor. I knew that Bush had cut back pensions for war veterans, insurance paid to soldiers killed in battle and the pay of currently serving American soldiers.      I learnt one thing- the personal side of the story. I learnt about a woman from Michigan, who's son died in Iraq. I learnt about her struggle to come to terms with the ignorance of people who believe that the war was just and necessary. I struggled to come to terms with the two recruitment officers walking around poor neighbourhoods, luring young men and women into the armed forces as though they were hunting in a butcher's store. I saw the young people turning to the armed forces in order to pay their way through college. I also witnessed a dear lady read the last letter that she received from her son, before he was killed in a Black Hawk helicopter crash. I witnessed a lot. I cried and I cheered, shuddered and gasped. Mothers sobbed for their children and the soldiers shook their heads, in disgust at their commander in chief and his self appointed presidency. There was a lot of anguish and even more anger.       Mothers, sons, politicians, friends, families, businessmen, teenagers, soldiers;  people ---one hero to unite them all in the struggle against the most potent threat against our society: blind faith. Bush's voters have it in spades.      I see more justification in invading America to liberate the Americans from Bush, than I saw justification to do likewise in Iraq. Let's fight for our freedom.
