Like half the furniture is missing, mom's pretty pissed off about it, and I found an awesome site! fanfiction.net  I just found it like, 10 pm last night. Oh well. Good luck with the remainder of the story, guys! Don't set any buildings on fire while I'm gone, Darkblaze, and SI, try not to go berserk or anything. Email me constantly at this email address or I shall (shall is such a strange word, ya know) weep constantly!  lalagirl555@yahoo.com I'm gonna try and get aol messenger out there okay? I'll post my new screename as soon as possible. I LOVE YOU GUYS IN A STRAIT NON SEXUAL JUST FRIENDS WAY!!!!!!! (Hugs both Darkblaze and SI, then waves goodbye) -Dilussional Child- ...........
