Man versus himself Man versus machine Man versus the world mankind versus me. The circles go on, the wisdom I lack, the burdens keep piling, up on my back, so hard to breathe, to take the next step the mountains are high, I wait in the depths, yearning for grace, and hoping for peace, Dear GOD INCREASE!  Healing Hands of God, have mercy on our unclean souls once again. Jesus Christ, Light of the World, burning bright within out hearts forever Freedom means love without condition without beginning or an end Here's my heart, let it be forever Yours.   Only You can make every new day seems so new!"
