But I didn't want to create this thing on Friday and not post until Monday night or Tuesday, so I guess the first thing I'll say is good morning and happy Memorial Day.  Enjoy your grilled meats and salads, and take a moment of silence to empathize with the hundreds of families for whom this must be an incredibly painful holiday.  I'll be back on Monday to deliver my thoughts on a host of topics.  Have a good weekend.
