If you're reading this, knowing I won't be back until the twenty-seventh, then you must  really  be bored since that means you've probably been checking regularly.  So far we've done three "phases": community service, acclimatization, and safari.  It's been alright, but the whole teamwork thing and all the group-related hassle has been amazingly annoying.  In any event...     Community Service   We stayed at a primary school called Kimbushi outside Moshi for several days, helping obtain and work with supplies to rebuild one of the buildings.  We're also going to buy some uniforms.  The kids were nice; they all would crowd around me when I sat down and played soccer and frisbee with me.  I let one of them borrow my watch though, and never saw him again.  Stupid decision, but w/e.     Acclimatization   After hanging out a little with the Maasai and seeing part of this circumcision ceremony (but not the actual circumcision part), we hiked up Longido Mountain, near the Tanzania-Kenya border in the north.  It wasn't that bad, overall, except my damn nose bled a few times.     Safari   We went on safari at Lake Manyara National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater.  It was alright; there were bunches of zebras and giraffes and hippos, etc., and we could stand up in the Jeep where the roof opened up.  Not very comfortable, but moderately interesting.  Not really better than seeing it in an Imax, though.    Tomorrow, we're leaving for Mt. Kilimanjaro.  We're only carrying our daypacks, but I anticipate it'll be a real biotch, especially since I'm not taking any medicine for altitude sickness (I'm allergic to it).  After that, rest and relaxation in Zanzibar.  Then, we're flying out of Dar es Salaam to Munich and then to Boston.  So, this being my eighteenth day (including build-up day), I have exactly two weeks left here, and will be back on July 27, as aforementioned.  After I get back, my birthday will be right then (July 31), so either a movie (e.g., "Garden State") or Rockport or a combination.  I'll see you all when I get back.  I can't wait to return to Newton.  Later.
