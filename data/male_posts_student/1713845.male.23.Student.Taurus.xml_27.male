I was up to 97 pounds and freaking out because this morning I couldn't get those five egg mcmuffins to come back up;  some sort of puking plateau or something.  Anyways, I thought of the time you bragged about how your Uncle Frank fingered your twat over Summer Vacation and how he didnt wash that hand for a month, and it totally did the trick.  Thanks skank.  Tiffini
