Pilger has spent much time in the Middle East, shooting films and filing stories about the Israel/Palestine conflict, as well as Iraqi/US problems.  Once again, the message is clear -- the reason that the Iraqi people have suffered so greatly has as much to do with Saddam Hussein as it does with the economic sanctions placed on him by the US and Britain.    If we were fighting to liberate the Iraqi people, maybe I'd be for this.  But after watching us give the Taliban an out (give us Osama, keep breaking all sorts of human rights laws), I learned our interests have little to do with people, and everything to do with American justice and vengance.    Al-Jazeera is back in the news, in the same negative light it seems to find itself under in America.  The station, which was  urlLink banned  from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, is also under fire from the US and Britain for its  urlLink coverage of the Iraqi conflict .  A new  urlLink english language website  that went public on Monday has already been hacked and seen major server troubes in the past 48 hours.   While the US likes to dog Al-Jazeera, it needs to be pointed out that the network is constantly lauded for its  urlLink groundbreaking coverage of conflict in the dictatorial-laden Middle East .  The countries that take issue with the paper include Britain, the United States, Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.  Why?  Because each says the paper is beefing up the opposition and making them look bad.  Interesting.
