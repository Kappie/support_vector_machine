I feel my absimal productivity is justified by my meager wages. I wake up around 7:20am to make it to work by 7:30am, just in time for our group morning nap and crossword puzzle. I gathered much summer booty with my new coworker, Jamill, while we inspected (inspected = rummage  pilfered) Crosby.   Because Luke and I don't see each other enough, we celebrated the last week in his present apartment with a party of cold cuts and cheese. SURPRISE, LAURA!  Two days ago I burned my thigh on the lamp Benny gave me. Thanks, Benny.  Hijo de puta.  My burn has changed many colors: beginning with a burning red, then a blister white, finally a blushing blue. Never experiencing a burn before, I asked if this would be the final and permanent color. Laura explained that it would actually remain white and it would spread to the rest of my body. I now fear I will soon lose my ability to dance to the beat and maintain a culture.    Laura:  Yes, but at least you'll get to sit at the lunch counter.  Thanks, Laura. Thank you for taking pictures of my burn while I contorted myself into pornographic positions.  Jake asked if I enjoyed anal sex. I gave him my answer and explained why. That's all you need to know. This exciting and informative conversation was followed by Jake shoving a cob of corn into Laura's underwear. Not new to me, Laura was shocked, however.   Laura:  Living with Jake is like having corn up the ass.  Hey Laura, it's got to get there somehow.
