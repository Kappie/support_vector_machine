Peace  Well hello to everyone, from out here in Blanding Utah! Im starting to get a little bored here... thats probably how Blanding got its nickname... “bland”...  For those of you who have a vocabulary of about 14.5 words, “Bland” means boring or plain. Just a little helper for yah.  Tomorrow i head off to the allmighty gas station to grab a phone card so i can once again make phone calls to my close friends such as clark and kens. I’ve gone through 1 disposable camera and im looking to snap through a new one. Im waiting for my dad to send me some more cash so i can get busy on all these money consuming tasks that i, sadly, have to do.  Its been a lot of fun riding fourwheelers and chasing people around Monticello with 15 people crowded into a Ford Expedition driven by a crazy 16 year old. But hey, it all works.   Shutt is still crazy.
