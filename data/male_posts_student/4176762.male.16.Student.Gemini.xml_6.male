Too bad, I won't elaborate.  Right now I'm waiting for Spiku to pick me up for some school service hours.  While at school I'll probably to something, I mean they are not going to give me service hours for nothing.  Oh, and I have to pick up my school laptop.  I get to use Windows again, yay! ¬.¬   Well I best be ending this short blog post about nothing in particular.  Until next time.
