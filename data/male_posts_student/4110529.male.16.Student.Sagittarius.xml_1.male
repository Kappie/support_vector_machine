Our pay is directly not linked to the performance of the store, so we operate at a total remove from the customers.  So when a customer buys over two hundred dollars worth of groceries, we tend to view that as a hostile affront, a veritable attack aimed directly at us, for the sole purpose of inconveniencing us.  In my second or third week of cashier work a customer came to the till who will remain burned into my memory and composite sentences  sempiternally.  She was about five feet five inches tall, but, due to her approximate two hundred fifty pounds of disgusting fat, leaned on the shopping cart so as to support her weight, much as apatosaur's would, some paleontologists hypothesize, dwell in deep swamps and marshes so that the water could support their terrific bulk.  She was sped like a toad, with a sort of fat neck that continued at the width of her jaw until it reached her shoulders, resembling the air sac with which frogs vocalize.  Her mouth was a weird wide shape, and her most unfortunate shade of lipstick did nothing to alleviate her ugliness.  To counterbalance the immense weight that she fas forcing upon the handlebar of the cart, she had loaded the interior with groceries until her enormous pile extended above the top of the cart, so that she looked like a tugboat pushing a garbage barge.  She had the most interesting choices in food; she purchased a number of low carbohydrate sodas and artificially sweetened products, which led me to believe that she was diabetic, a notion supported by her fantastic girth.  She also bought multiple cakes, which lead me to believe that she is of the class of diabetic that fill make few healthy changes to her lifestyle, opting instead to take massive doses of insulin and continue with the behaviors that led to her diabetes in the first place (assuming that she is in fact diabetic).  Sh also bought a number of ugly china plates of the type that we in the supermarket sell for less than $2 per.  They are a panoply of dull and dark hues, not at all conducive to pleasurable eating, yet she bought them.  I have never seen another customer buy those plates.  The rest of her groceries she wanted in plastic which, while convenient for the bagger in terms of time spent opening bags, hold very little in comparison to paper, and do not hold the groceries in any pattern.  As such, the groceries in her cart, as I scanned,  were in exactly the same state as they were before she put them on the conveyor belt.  This Brobdingnagian human beanbag chair had brought three of her own plastic bags with her, which provide a total refund of fifteen cents.  My bagger, without showing the slightest emotion at her suggestion that he use these crinkled, time consuming bags, obliged her.  She made sure to ask me if I had refunded her for the bags before she left.  When the entire transaction was said and done, she had purchased over $350 of groceries, a number that most cashiers would associate with Christmas eve dinner, thanksgiving, or Seder.  The groceries occupied two carts, whose steel frames with right angles were powerless to give shape to the piles of groceries within, which fit their purchaser so aptly.  As she had two carts, my bagger wheeled one to her car and helped her to unload the groceries.  She tipped him with one dollar. One Fucking Dollar. Because this stingy, gargantuan, bufiform excuse for a human being had a store discount card, I was able to look at the journal paper inside of the register and discover that she is the mother of a pear shaped boy a few years older than me at my old school.  This son of hers inherited her propensity for weight gain, and as such bore, when I knew him, a more  than passing resemblance to the man-child son of the woman whom Yosemite Sam periodically tried to marry in old Loony-Toons episodes so as to gain her inheritance.  Like a pear with legs, he had narrow, weak shoulders, from which rose a double chin of a neck and a fat face that one would think incapable of expression, which was too often the case.  His legs were fat at the thigh, with no power, with skinny calves.  In short, he was fat in a way that made him terrible at football.  The paterfamilias of this unfortunate clan is a liability lawyer specializing in cases where an obstetrician is accused of, through negligence in delivery, causing birth defects which very well may have occurred without any help from the doctor.  This cow of a woman came back about two week later, and bought over $400 of groceries.  She arrived at the checkout at thirteen minutes to closing and was in her car with her groceries five minutes after closing.  Her purchases included a new stack of plates which she asked be bagged in paper with folded bags between each.  Although I did not participate in the transaction, I still shudder to think of her, and dread ever having to serve her.  This time, after a different coworker of mine had bagged her groceries and helped her load both carts full into her car, she tipped him two dollars.  Frau Farbinse and the Rebates from Hell Once, when I was running the express aisle, a German or Slavic sounding woman came buying two separate orders, one consisting of what I assumed to be groceries specified buy some employer and the other of two slices of cheesecake from the in-store bakery.  Her iterative insistence that the two orders were separate bordered on annoying.  In her first order she presented a slip with an amount, a department, and an initial on it.  I thought that it was a bill and rang it up as such.  She payed with a check which she retrieved from an envelope, not a book, thereof, and proceeded to review the receipt.  As she was reading through the reciept in the most popular mode, holding it as though it were a scroll and muttering under her breath, I rang up the cheesecake.  Upon realizing that I had rung up as a bill what had really been a refund, she immediately flew into hysterics.  I  voided the cheesecake because I surmised that it should be separate from the refund, and refunded twice the value on the slip, the extra time accounting for my having charged her the original amount once.  The refunds are no mean feat, as they amount to voiding a purchase that never took place with that register, and thusly require a manager override for each one.   The manager leaves copies of the manager key in all of the cashier keyboards, so at least i didn't have to call anyone over from the courtesy desk, however the “void-8-quantity-amount-grocery-clear-turn the key-override-code-enter-turn the key-repeat” sequence is time consuming and prone to mistake and annoying noises from the machine.  I gave this woman her receipt and cash and rang up the cheesecake, however she was not yet finished.  She wanted to know why the cheesecake was on the same receipt as the refund.  I tried to explain to her that the minus sign after the price denoted a void, which made the net charge for the cheesecake zero, however she was not to be appeased so easily.  She reiterated that she had wanted the two orders separate, and was immune to my explanation, instead mindlessly repeating in her staccato fashion "tze-pe-ret".  After several minutes during which I contemplated just writing a new reciept by hand, she, without warning, suddenly comprehended what I was saying, and just had me write “refund” on the original receipt next to the charge for the rebate amount. I recuperated thanks to a dearth of customers for the rest of the day, but was nonetheless shaken.  Maybe she didn't want anyone to see that she had bought the cheesecake.
