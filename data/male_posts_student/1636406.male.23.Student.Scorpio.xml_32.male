She had a little bass solo that sounded pretty funky. I had a good time and although I didn't say much It was really great. I left kind-of early because I was tired, but they were finished playing anyway.  Right now I am reading Against All Enemies by Richard A. Clarke, and Sleeping with the Devil by Robert Baer. Both relate to one another and both are excellent in my opinion. I am looking forward to reading further into the oil industry. Oil is something seemingly innocuous- yet we fail to realize the entire modern world has been built with and on oil. The economy is oil, the cities are oil, technology is oil- everything you  see around you required oil at one stage of it's production, whether that was in it's transportation or an energy source during fabrication. About 290 kg of fossil fuels goes into the production of one desktop computer not including transportation.   Most people think the oil industry is all about cars- but it's so much more, everything relies on fossil fuels, that is why the economy goes crazy when oil prices fluctuate.   Many people think that it's simple to convert to a hydrogen fuel based economy- but its near impossible. And I read somewhere it is enough of a problem to bankrupt every government worldwide for a century.  Ironically, because it is rich in hydrocarbons, and the infrastructure is in place- the best substances to use for hydrogen based engines are fossil fuels.
