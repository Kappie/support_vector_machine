Chorus:   You're all that i want now   I hope what i need don't seem so much   Just for you to want me   Just for you to want me   Just for u to love me         And i know its just a dream   thats seems impossible to meet   Now everything so clear to me   That i'm not good enough for you   For you.....    Chorus        Like you   Love you   Miss you      Like you   Love you   Miss you     by Herry   A song dedicated to that girl...
