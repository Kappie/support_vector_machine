[01:44:05] Syn: Dear journal [01:44:12] Syn: Today was a boring day [01:44:20] Syn: I got three emails that I gave a damn about and a bunch of spam [01:44:43] Syn: I was lonely so I called the phone sex hotline six times. [01:44:51] Syn: Now I'm several hundred dollars in debt. [01:45:03] TembreFe`ll: Dear Syn. [01:45:07] TembreFe`ll: Do you think I can resond? I'm a book. [01:45:12] TembreFe`ll: Get a life. [01:45:14] TembreFe`ll: -Your journal. [01:45:48] Keir_Santage: Dear Journal, some sex-crazed woman kept phoning my cellphone this morning...   Heeheehee.  This time tomorrow, I will probably have the following: a) A medal of some kind (woohoo) b) A very painful leg (oweeeee) c) Several detentions (the fun never ends) d) A fresh pile of homework (Mr Essay Question, meet Mrs Lit Match!)  So I'm guessing it'll be another craptastic 5 hours of school. Whoopee-doo-ooo.
