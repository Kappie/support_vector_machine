You may find it weird that I still watch that, but if I see that Nelly video for "It's Getting Hot In Here" again, I'm going to start taking off my clothes........  And no one, but  no one  wants to see that.......  But anyway......  The only good show I've seen is Invader Zim......  A weird, pissed-off alien and a retarded robot are thrown into a darker earth........  The entire show screams evil, which is probably why they never show it.  This guy would eat the Rugrats, spit out their bones, and crap on their graves.  I find myself in shame that I'm still talking about Nickelodeon, so let's move on, shall we?  What has happened to the acid-spitting, face-swiping, bone-crushing, chest-bursting aliens of my day?  ET was just a prune spliced with Elmo, Stitch was a Smurf on crack, and the aliens from Encounters of the Third Kind were just clones of Mozart.  But the aliens from the Aliens trilogy were the most unstoppable bastards ever!  You shoot them; you burn in their blood...  Genius!  You look at their eggs; you end-up puking out your heart and giving birth to a pissed-off little worm!   Genius!!!   Where is the violence in Disney these days???   Go America........  Wait….  Stop......  Haven't I said something about Disney already???
