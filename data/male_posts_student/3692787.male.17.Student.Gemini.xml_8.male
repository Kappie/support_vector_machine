Promise!" "We're not your typical nerds, at least, not your home-school-home nerds." "There are no nerds here, just lots of cute guys and girls!"  These are some lines that I remember from the several different org brochures that were pimped to me by some pitiful mem, who most likely lost at "maiba mang-aalok," during my first couple of weeks at UP. Apparently, the market for nerds grows thin. It has to be if they take such great measures to show that no one in their circle is a nerd, right?  But my question is this: what's wrong with being a nerd?  I admit it. I am a bona fide nerd. I play video games, single-player RPGs especially, I have participated in a pen-and-paper RPG, I like using the PC, I watch Star Trek, I enjoy Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, and I used to play a Collectible Card Battle Game (Pokémon, not Yu-Gi-Oh!, though I enjoyed the latter's animé version quite a bit). I am physically depraved, I enjoy reading, I like being alone and I study before exams (not too hard though; I've never ever had to cram at full force in my life). These are the things that I have fun with. Is that so wrong?  This is who I am, and I have accepted that. These things are what I enjoy; why should I be persecuted for that? Why do you roll your eyes when I go on about dilithium crystal matrices, 5-turn game-ending combos and hot elven chicks (oops)? I certainly don't give you any guff about watching the PBA, listening to 90.7 Love Radio or your penchant for hot elven chicks (I really should stop with that), do I?  I refuse to conform to a certain societal standard of what a "normal" person should be like. What's so great about being "normal" anyway? What is individuality if you end up being just like everyone else? News flash people: "normal" is just a polite way of saying "mediocre." You live and die with the fads. You exist exactly as the powers that be have intended you to. Between you and me, I'm the happy one.  If it were just a matter of my being different then I would have just let this topic be; it's everyone else's loss. But, as previously stated, it pains me to see my fellow peyupsters denying their true nature. Come on, get real will ya? You can't be in UP and not be nerdy to a certain extent. If you weren't nerdy beforehand, you will be afterwards because this "skill" is essential for survival. Your only problem is that you have let yourself be deluded by our society's skewed perspective of what a person ought to be. You have decided to let everyone else dictate who you should be, when in fact that choice is entirely up to you. You decide who you are, where you are, what you do, think and say. Thus, you are hindered from fulfilling that which is your true nature.  Fear not the thought of not wearing the same things or owning the same stuff or saying the same lines or idolizing the same people as everybody else. Do not be afraid of loneliness. In time, things will change. You no longer have to flock towards the greatest concentration of souls, rather, they will flock towards you. Trust me, you will find yourself thanking me later.  Come now, don't be scared. Take the red pill, Neo...  completely wrong thought of the day: "Life sucks. If yours doesn't, congratulations, you're retarded." -me on a very, very bad day. ^Baka yan yung gawin kong "about me" sa friendster profile ko... Heeheehee...
