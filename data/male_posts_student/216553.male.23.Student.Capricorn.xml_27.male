Once you're actually done the anatomy, the clinical applications are fun! I don't care that it takes a couple of minutes to read a question and come up with an answer at all because at least all the material is coming together. I'm sure gross anatomy is helpful (yes, I'm being sarcastic), but I like this material a lot more :)   Anyhow, exams did go quite well in the end. Again, I pulled some high A's, so that's all fine and dandy.   Here's an awesome clinical example:   "A 50 year old male patient comes into your office and tells you the following: "Last night, my left leg felt weak all of a sudden and as Iattempted to walk to the kitchen, it seemed as though the leg was buckling underneath me. I reached out to the table with my left hand to support myself and noticed that I had lost strength there too. I sat downas I was feeling bothdizzyand tired. I took two ibuprofen and went to bed. The next morning, I tried to wash my face, but couldn't tell if the tap water was hot or cold with my left hand, but could notice that it was hot with my right hand. I then noticed that my right eyelid seemed all droopy, and was having double-vision. What is wrong with me?"   Try and figure it out if you can :) Gmail account forthe first person withthe right answer!   Anyhow, I'll be back later. I'm going over to Jaime's house to prepare some food for a party tonight.
