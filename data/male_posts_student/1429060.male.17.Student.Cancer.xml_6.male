Tonight was the open mic night at Java. We had two guitarists and many poets (Morgan Fox is, I steal the concept of Elise, a fucking genius poet). I was struck by how painful Morgan Fox's poetry was. Tarah read as well as Elise. Then there was a girl who poetized/improvised which was damn cool. I was planning to read the second prompt poem I wrote for Alanna (DOY) but, alas, I am such a damn coward in front of an audience. I did get ready to read though! It was simply a minute before open mic closed, and a bit too late. Now Elise and Alanna and Morgan Stewart and ZoÃ« are prepared to murder me.   I am too fearful of people. Elise and I think it is because I don't trust people. I need to work on that. It restricts my poetry.  Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes. You can't get enough of them. (-Frank McCourt)  Here is the prompt poem I was going to read.   Look ahead Parallel lines wandering off in the distance Never meeting, so says geometry Lines painted by liquid silver upon a rough curved surface A metallic insect crawling on a track Wood and steel and stones to stand The iron driven deep into the living slats To hold the path together, a tie of sorts Euclid says that the lines will never, can never touch Look up The twisted set of human handiwork A factor that lifts the beast of terra creation To obey the will of the human sculptors That is physics 101 A triangle is the strongest shape arranged Into a tower that can't stand to the elements Gravity would drag it into an arch But cosmic laws say that it can stand Unlike the bending of a cardboard tube Newton says that gravity pulls downward Look around Walking with hands in pocket, down a trail To your left you see the future of this little disintegrating society Rolling off into the distance It's belching smoke into the atmosphere C-F-C's and C-O-2's The sun is growing more hidden each day Mental society breaking down Looking at this little human invention, a toy It's devouring nature at its own slow pace No sun, no air, no life Fuck this endless circle of death and decay When you are collecting two-hundred each time you pass go There goes another rainforest And when the last fish caught, the last tree cut The last animal stuffed and put on display Man will realize he can't eat money Look up again There is the sun, wallowing in an oily haze of pollution Look ahead again An incoming smog is rolling around Break-out the gas masks and the goggles We are getting to the place we are headed Dead-end, no passing go, collect your goddamn cash for the last time Only footprints left between the railroad ties.   It is rather angry and melancholy, but more angry than melancholy. Ever have that feeling that you are among the few who know what is actually happening to the earth when a diesel engine lets off a putrid cloud of black smoke? I am one of those. It really sucks too, because people don't see the importance. The earth is just a temporary resource to them, and when it dies, where will they go? WE DON'T LIVE ON A RENEWABLE RESOURCE PEOPLE, DAMNIT!  I apologize for my ranting. I shall fall silent. Cheers, humans.
