You can check out her blog under the Friend's Blog section and make sure you do not right-click on her blog, because you will get a message telling you to eat her shit and when you click Ok because there's only Ok button, tons of Windows popping up which makes you busy doing hand exercise.  Lucky for me, I am a computer whiz so I managed to terminate the code from running. Everything was back to normal and I messaged Melanie in MSN.   Here's our conversation:  ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Wah liao..... your blog got so many porn site...... u make me wanna... says: wahahhahahah whu call u ryte click huh? u make me wanna... says: hUH? u make me wanna... says: wahahahahahahah u make me wanna... says: coopy ryte u make me wanna... says: f**ker ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: See your source code also got wrong ar.... ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Didn't know you are such a bad gal u make me wanna... says: yap u make me wanna... says: yayaya nw den u noe u make me wanna... says: u too weak ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: Nvm lor.... next time don't give you things liao..... ﭏĩлğ Ỹї - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: :P u make me wanna... says: hmmmermmmhnmdijfcn o u make me wanna... says: dun like tt la u make me wanna... says: i treat u spp gd u make me wanna... says: i ur gf leh u make me wanna... says: =[ ﭏĩлğ Ỹї is bathing - http://limxingyi.blogspot.com/ says: ......... "-_-"" .......    Back to here, she claimed she is my girlfriend but I am not her boyfriend. You know I am sick and tired of hearing her sprouting "Xing Yi, Wo Ai Ni (I love you)" out of the blue in Mandarin. It chills my spine whenever I heard it, and sometimes she come over and flirt around on me until I was chilled so badly, I couldn't move.  You might ask "Why don't I be her boyfriend?", "Is she very ugly?" or "Is she very fat?", "Is she very smelly?" or "Is she blah blah blah....". Ok, I will let you take a look at her picture below.     Then you might still ask "She's so pretty, then why you don't want to be her boyfriend?"  Because I do not fit her, we are impossible and she could find someone else far more better than me. (Hehe, I learnt this from Channel 8 drama). She should go after those who are handsome, good-looking, dashing, hunky and loaded to go with her beauty look.  So in order to dishearten her, I acted gay and I pretend to take interest in all the hunks in the sch. Despite knowing I am a gay, she still likes me. Oh man, how am I going to shake her off? Tell me.
