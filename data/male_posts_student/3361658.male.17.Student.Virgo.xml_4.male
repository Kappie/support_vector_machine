In fact I think it is not a sport and aside from the health benefits is a waste of time!  I don't really like it too much.. I don't have fun doing it.  So why do it?  Hmm.. I think I do it because it is a challenge.  Also the fact that every race is different and anyone can have a good day and win a race.  Oh and running is painful and stupid and only for people who are truly messed up in the head.  Running is for all the people who are too scared to get high off of weed so they do it by running.  It works out pretty well health wise.  The only real reason I run is because the people that run with me are very nice people, and they don't really care if I suck because that's not what its about.  Ok well that's about all I have to say for now."      This is all courtesy of my good friend Andy G (and I feel the same way about running).  If you would like any of your writing to be posted up here then just send it to me and it will be up in a day.  If you have a blog yourself, feel free to send me the URL and I'll promote that as well.  Anything you want, you got it...
