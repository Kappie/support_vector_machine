Well, here's how the story begins...  okay, so my grandmother (the one im living with currently) has this really annoying tendency to go psycho in the weeks leading up to whenever one of us (mum or I) leaves for australia. she either:  a) forgets to take her medicine b) forgets what medicine she is taking c) takes the wrong medicine and gets deathly sick d) falls at church and bruises herself e) falls in her own house and bruises herself  now this is a woman who  GOES TO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK .  SHE IS 84 YEARS OLD AND STILL GOES TO THE GYM  how she manages to fall and injure herself is a bit suspect. that, and the fact that she has never fallen and hurt herself at any other point other than the weeks leading up to when we leave.  now, during the first weekend of june, both me mum and i were out of town, and supposedly my grandmother fell in the house and did some damage to her back. however, she failed to let us know, and my mum only figured out when my grandma was talking to one of her friends on the phone and mentioned it. so we took her to the doctor, and everything seemed to be fine. come this recent wednesday, she complains of pain in her side, says that she has fallen again at church, and scheduled a catscan for tomorrow at 3:30 (our flight would leave at 3 for australia). she thought she could keep us here with that, but mum and i still decided to go.  today, while playing golf, i get a call from mum saying while we were both gone, g'ma fell on her wrist and broke it, and that she has to get a cast tomorrow, and it has to be on there for 6 weeks. this leads to us having to cancell the trip, forced to watch over her 24/7 because she cant handle us leaving for 7 fucking weeks. i mean, come on, ive been living with her for 10 months now, and she cant let us have a vacation. this is bullshit. she is hard enough to deal with when i dont mind her around, but when i cant stand to even look at her, i know she is going to bug me every ten minutes until i end up going insane. i rarely get mad, but this is probably the maddest i have  EVER  been in my entire life. she does not respect me, she treats me like i know nothing, and when i try to have a serious conversation with her, she laughs in my face. and she flat out lies to my face as well. it is pissing me off. man i need to let off some steam. cmon people lets do something over the summer if im going to stay in this boring town. if not, i  WILL  go insane. man, i need a drink...
