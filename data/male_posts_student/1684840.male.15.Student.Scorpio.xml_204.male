Sam and Annie are officially going out now (they make a great couple!) and so are Michaela and Craig!  That came as a complete shock to be honest... but oh well.  Sheldon's flight was all effed up because of the shitty airport service offered by United Airlines.  The departure and arrival times wouldn't stop changing.  Hopefully he will be here tomorrow early in the afternoon.  I hope he gets here alright and works out how to use an English payphone to ring Mum in the morning!  My PC has been going okay since my format (yep, had to do it AGAIN) so hopefully this time it will behave.  Cya!
