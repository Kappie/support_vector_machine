After 7 long years of completing my Engineering , I am off to the school again (something unthinkable until a few years ago but more common these days in tune with the way its done in the West).I am trying to start with an open mind and I guess my future blogs will have lots of vignettes from my student life,Asia-Pac  Business.God bless me.
