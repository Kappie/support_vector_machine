Case in point, a good friend of mine from... not the Cape, but soon to be Boston (the vagueness is intentional, of course, to preserve anonymity)... IMed me today and asked me to do her a favor:  "Tell me I'm a good person and that three weeks will pass quickly."  The fact that said person could ever need reassurance that she's anything but wonderful is heartbreaking to me, and the fact that her need to be reassured comes from her shaky relationship with bitter, malicious parents is a predictable but immensely frustrating addition to the plot.  This girl has, in 5 short months, managed to become a very close and trusted companion, whose words have been a comfort to me when I needed to hear that  I , too, was a good person and that things were going to be okay.  And so needless to say, I felt the need to come to her rescue tonight.    Luckily, I was able to reassure her that in three weeks, she'd have a support base the likes of which she's never experienced at her fingertips, as well as being smack-dab in the middle of a vibrant, wonderful city that's perfect for a girl like her to figure herself out in.  If you're reading this, dear, I promise you everything will be okay.  Do what we talked about and let me know the result.  Ignore the notion that money is an obstacle and do what you need to do.  If this opportunity is indeed only for this one semester, sign up immediately and don't think twice or apologize for it.  And then tell me.  Everything's going to be fine.  As for me, I can't be so sure.  But that's another story.  Mary J, sing it, girl...  "no more drama in our lives."
