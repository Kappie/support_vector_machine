I'm supposed to be going out for drinky drinky with Ashlyn, but she's working until 9ish, and I have a feeling she's going to be too tired, which is fine, because I am also too tired.  I haven't been writing lately, I've fallen into another slump where I have nothing really of substance to say. Maybe a little later.
