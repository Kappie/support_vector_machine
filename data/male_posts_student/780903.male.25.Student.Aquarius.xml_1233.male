This toothpaste tastes awful.  NARRATOR A parent’s hardest job is making sure her kid doesn’t die.  But her second hardest is getting him to brush his teeth.  But not anymore.  (MOM ENTERS, CARRYING TWO TUBES)  MOM Try this!  (SHE HANDS HIM A TUBE.  HE READS THE LABEL.)  BOY (SOUNDING IT OUT, CONFUSED) Krazy glue?  MOM Oops.  Wrong one.   (SHE HANDS HIM THE OTHER TUBE)  BOY Willy Wonka toothpaste?  Cool!  (HE SQUEEZES SOME TOOTHPASTE ONTO HIS TOOTHBRUSH.  IT’S BROWN.  HE STARTS TO BRUSH.)  BOY (WITH A MOUTH FULL OF TOOTHPASTE) This tastes just like chocolate pudding!  NARRATOR That's right. It tastes like chocolate pudding -- because it IS chocolate pudding.   MOM A toothpaste made of chocolate pudding?  Is that good for my son’s teeth?  NARRATOR Of course not.  Here’s a computer simulation.  (ANIMATED COMPUTER SIMULATION BEGINS.)  NARRATOR Ordinary toothpaste keeps teeth white and shiny. (THE ANIMATED TOOTH SPARKLES)  Our toothpaste turns them brown, and then they fall out. (THE ANIMATED TOOTH TURNS BROWN AND FALLS OUT)  But it tastes great!  MOM And that’s what’s important!  NARRATOR Exactly!  (THE BOY IS GULPING TOOTHPASTE DIRECTLY FROM THE TUBE.  A CLOSEUP INDICATES THE TOOTHPASTE ISN’T SOLID BROWN, BUT HAS A TAN STRIPE)  MOM Is the tan stripe a whitening gel?  NARRATOR No, it’s caramel.  BOY (MOUTH FULL OF PUDDING) This is the best toothpaste ever!  NARRATOR That’s right.  Because it’s all natural.  Other toothpaste manufacturers use chemicals with long names no one can understand.  Tetrasodium pyrophosphate?  Sodium lauryl sulfate?  Fluoride?  We just use sugar, chocolate, and flour.  MOM Flour has some of the same letters as fluoride.  NARRATOR Exactly!  (BOY IS TRYING TO RINSE THE TOOTHPASTE CLEAN, BUT HE CAN’T)  BOY I can’t get it off.  NARRATOR That’s because you’re rinsing with water.  Willy Wonka toothpaste goes better with milk.  (MOM HEADS TO THE KITCHEN.  THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER.  SHE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR TO GET SOME MILK.)  NARRATOR While you’re in the kitchen – I should tell you that Willy Wonka toothpaste contains baking powder.  MOM Baking SODA?  NARRATOR No, baking powder.  Check this out.  Just squeeze out drops of our toothpaste onto a baking sheet –-  (MOM GETS OUT A BAKING SHEET AND DOES AS TOLD)  NARRATOR -- stick it in the oven (SHE DOES), and twenty minutes later (THE OVEN BELL DINGS), you’ve got brownies (SHE TAKES BROWNIES OUT OF THE OVEN).  MOM Wow!  That’s convenient.  But what do dentists think about Willy Wonka toothpaste?  NARRATOR They think we’re evil.  But –-  MOM  NARRATOR It tastes great! (THEY LAUGH)  BOY (O.S.) Mom!  I need more toothpaste!  NARRATOR Willy Wonka toothpaste.  Won’t clean your teeth, but it tastes great.  Now in snack size.  (JINGLE PLAYS: Willy Wonka Toothpaste... CAVI-TY-LICIOUS!)
