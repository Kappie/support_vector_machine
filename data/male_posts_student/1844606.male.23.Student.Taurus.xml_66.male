Aside from that, I feel pretty good, and that's a plus because the last week was shakey to say the least.  I was really dreading somebody visiting, but it turned out to be ok, though it left me increadibly sad and I've yet to put my finger on why.  But I'm thinking it has something to do with good memories clashing with the reality of now.  To be sure, I'm just not happy and I can't think of any way to fix it immediately.  I'm doing all that I can, but all I want to do is sleep.  Whether that's due to the cold, medication or other things I don't know.
