Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. Use the pain as fuel, as a reminder of your strength."       -August Wilson   I never knew how soundly I could sleep until my alarm pierced my unconsciousness at 7 a.m.  I immediately realized how tired I had been, and how heavy my body felt. I was  not  ready to get up. I snoozed until after 8, and was still able to get in a good cardio workout at the gym. It wasn't as long as I had planned -- slightly less than 15 minutes -- but it did get pretty intense. I would have gone longer, but it appears I pushed myself just a bit too hard on Saturday (Day 0) during my pre-Challenge run. After a couple minutes at 7 mph this morning, my legs simply did not want to run anymore. And since I am not too keen on the idea of overtraining this early in the Challenge, I cut my losses and hit the showers.  I'm sore, and I know I'll be even more sore once tomorrow rolls around. Soreness is good, though. And since I exercised in the morning, I have all evening to relax. :-)      Today's Meals    Bagel  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Apple, a few peanuts  Grilled chicken with wild rice  Turkey sandwich on crackers
