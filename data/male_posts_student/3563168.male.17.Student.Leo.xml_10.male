Probably due to the fact that it's the show that makes up how good television is, not what type of television you're watching. Well, it could be the type of television you're watching, but probably not due to the fact that most televisions work pretty well.  First of all, NBC is pissing me off because they're slowly sapping up all of their shows. Every time they advertise for "Freinds" (which is over with...) and "Who Wants to Marry my Dad?", it's always some crappy, mushy piano music or song that plays during the commercial. As if this wasn't enough, the announcer who is talking about the show talks like his girlfriend of 10 years just broke up with him.  I swear, NBC is slowly turning to a chick-channel.  On a lighter note, I've slowly become infatuated with infomercials. I can't tell why, because it's always the same song that plays for 30 minutes while the infomercial airs. Even though I'm sick of the get rich quick ones, I love the ones with products. They usually try to make it kind of interesting. Also, infomercials are just high energy; very different from the sap that NBC puts out.  In conclusion, I need a life because I'm talking about TV.
