And over Spring Break I got a Wacom Tablet Mouse and Pen and the Vaja case I wanted for my iPod. I figured my average bed time was 3:00am and average sleep time was 10 hours. Anyways so far this week its all cool. I started learning Premire in my graphics class personally I don't really care for it. I have a project in history tomrrow which is going to be easy. All I have to do is stand in front of the class for a while taking about the Second Industrial Revolution. Have Chemistry test Friday that could become very interesting. Also Romeo and Juliet has to be the most early known story about flausises and retards marrying. Anyways added some new stock photos to the gallery and also I reached 1048 songs on my iPod as well. Well until next time bye.
