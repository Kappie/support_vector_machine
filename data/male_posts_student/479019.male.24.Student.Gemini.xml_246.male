I got my readings for Bix's class copied and met with Prof. Santiago about course work and all that. Then I went to Prof. Diaz's course and it didn't really interest me, so I'm dropping it. I want to check out Keyder's class to replace it.  All in all today was a good day. Tomorrow I have another meeting on campus, and then I need to go grocery shopping. I want to get some spinach and tomatoes to go with my macaroni.  ***
