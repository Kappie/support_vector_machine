Oh and at lunch I was made "tray bitch" and disappointed with this tasks me and some fellow lunchmates came up with a plan... I was to take up the four trays, trip and fall face first on the floor dropping all the trays across the floor and running out with my hands over my face (I owe that to Chris)... Not that things of this sort haven't been done before but I thought it to be a good idea at the time. Anyways as I was going up I really wasn't thinking about doing it until I heard someone say "He isn't going to do it." That was enough of a motive for me I juggled the trays hit the back of my heel with the front of my other foot and went face first to the floor... The landing....IMPECCABLE... and i proceeded to run out of the lunchroomwith my hands over my face.               But it didnt stop there thinking clearly i took off my blue striped buttoned down shirt balled it up in my hand and made a break for it. I made the turn around the corner and literally bumped into a security guard on the walkie-talkie saying "Blue striped shirt you say?" By then I was hysterical laughing and a lil scared that they were actually looking for me. To clear my mind i went to the swim meet after school to watch Brian Doug Darin and MarK. They had to swim against this girly team literally.... girls!! What girls stand a chance against some of the strongest [SMUT]s around?!?!? None except maybe China from wrestling she's mad butch. But even she probably couldnt swim better than them but if she lost she would get mighty pissed and wreak havoc on the Swimming[SMUT]ters. Then they would jump in the water and taunt her cuz she would never be able to catch them! Especially since she would be in such awe if watching them do the butterfly stroke or watching Jesus dive. Well I gotta get to start some homework... AND ONE MORE THING IM NOT TRAY BITCH TOMORROW!!!
