I am down here till Thursday afternoon with the Hunts to help Mr. Hunt run the food pantry at his church for BETA summer hours. I am going to be rolling in hours if he remembers to count them all up before he writes them on the form that I have to turn in. It was a good night. I got in town around five-ish and Mom and Mike hung around and then  finally  left. Then I decided to go to the Sunday night worship service at their church. Mrs. Hunt plays the organ by the way. I found out there were going to be a lot of youth there too because it was Youth Sunday or something. I felt  really  bad though because they were so nice to me and invited me to come play volleyball and watch  Drumline  with em and I was sort being forced to leave instead of go and hang with them. I mean not forced in anyway I just felt that I should have left and went with the Hunt's to dinner instead of staying but now I am regretting the fact that I didn't stay. (That last compound sentence made no since.) Oh well right? Maybe I will get to see them and apologize for not going. I meet this really kick hash kid named Joey who plays the guitar. Well, he seemed really cool anyways man although I didn't get to chat to much. Anyways. I meet his mom and she noticed that I was wearing my shirt that I bought from the Matchbox Twenty concert Saturday night and she walked over to me and Mr. Hunt and was  very  nice. She said something like her son, Joey, meet Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox Twenty, at a wedding and Rob drug him all around the reception saying that he was his little bro or something. I think that was the story but I might have told it wrong. A lot of hot chicks in the youth group man. One girl caught my eye and man was she fine. Nice, nice, hash. Perfect. Five stars. Perfect ten. How many times have I said the word 'hash' in this post? I know all of you marching folks know what that word means but do the rest of you know? Leave me a comment. Okay. Now, before I go. I find it sort of funny that I am typing this, about to post it, but none of you can read it because I have yet to launch my updated site. When you see this message you will know that it is nothing major, just updated, I'm using Blogger now, and it is a heck of a whole lot cleaner looking. I hope I get to see that hash again. Maybe I can get her to visit my site. 'Chicks dig a dude w/ his own domain.' I was going to use that as my quote but I had to pass. I might revisit the idea later though right dude? Cheers mate!
