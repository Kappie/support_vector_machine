I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  I do not like them eight hours long. I do not like them when my answers are wrong. I do not like them open book. I have not liked the ones I took. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  Not essay form. Not in my dorm. Not fill in the blank. Not when they count toward my class rank. If I could take them weeks from now. I would not like them anyhow. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  I would not, could not, make them fun.  I will not like them till I'm done.  I'd like it more if I had none!  I do not like to issue spot. I do not like to think a lot. I do not like to cite a case. I do not like the hurried pace. Though sometimes it can bring me glee. That this one asks for policy. I do not like to learn the law. Although that is what school is for.  No rules to learn! No code to cite! I hate the code book, day and night  I would not, could not, in a chair. I could not, would not, it's not fair. To have to take them though we pay. A billion dollars every day. To have the privilege to be here. I want to make this very clear. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.
