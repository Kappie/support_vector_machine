But todays different, coz my whole family is worrying about my aunt who is in hospital now in a coma. Been praying very hard for her for the past few days. Reali hope she wakes up coz she is my fav aunt and she has been watching me grow up. So now i dun reali can't concentrate on anything. I think if she has woken up when I am in sch, at home, everywhere practically. Luckily, i have a few frens who have so willingly help my pray for my aunt when i asked them for help. Ah well, dun feel like writing any other things. So gtta go now.
