           
      I was driving to work today, like I do every weekend, and I got to thinking. I was beautiful. I used to be a machine. Nothing could touch me. Nothing. Things would bounce off of my skin like it was nothing, and back then it was nothing to me. I didn't care about anyone or anything too much that it affected me or what I was doing. I cared about stuff, just that stuff didn't take over my thoughts or life. I remember those times and I think, "what the hell happened to me"? I need to get back to that old Rob. The more focused person, the machine I used to be. I will rebuild and overcome. I will topple over anything that stands in my way.
