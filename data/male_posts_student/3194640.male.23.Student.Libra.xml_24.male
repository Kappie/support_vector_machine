Thankfully, I didn't have to be at work until 8 am this morning (I usually go to work at 7 am). The crappy thing about going to work so late is that I have to stay until 4:30 pm. I don't really want to be here at work today. I have to work tomorrow. I don't want to go. On the bright side, I should be able to get some studying done. It'll be slow tomorrow at work. I can't wait.
