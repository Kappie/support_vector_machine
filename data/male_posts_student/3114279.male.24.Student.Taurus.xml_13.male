      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn with a gross-out story for all to hear. So, gather round, kiddies, for the latest Publix adventure. Last night, the same as many nights at Publix, I was bagging groceries, when I notice this woman doing her shopping. She is in her early twenties, and very heavy, but wearing these short short shorts with a slit up the side. I couldn't turn away. When there is that much skin it is impossible to avoid it. I don't know what it is. Even if she was a guy I couldn't have turned away. It's just human nature. Anyway, she picks my aisle (of course) and the first four items she slides down are two boxes of condoms and two tubes of astroglide. Then the smell hit me. The smell of hours of gross, slapping, unwashed sex. Ugh! I almost gagged right there. She asked me to help her out, and on the way she says, very flirtily, "Pretty sad that the only thing I have to do on a Friday night is grocery shop, huh?" I just got the fuck out of dodge as quickly as I could. And that is the story of how the very last of my libido was destroyed.
