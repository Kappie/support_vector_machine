I came to order the pizza so I tried my favourite Boston Pizza! I spoke to the girl who served us the other night, she remembered me as when she asked for telephone number I said I was visiting from England! 'I think you were in the other night and you ordered pizza and bread and I mucked the order up?!' Yeah, Hi, nice pizza though! 'Hey'. So when I told her the telephone number, she didnt understand when I said "double 3". 'It must be an English thing!" she said. I just think it's because she was thick! So I ordered the pizza, for an individual, and then she tells me I have to have a minimum order of $17.99. As it was individual it was only $9.25. Gawd! So I thanked her and said it was only me who was eating!  I rang Pizza Hut, whose minimum was $10.00, but individual pizzas cost $3.95! Argghhh! So I ended up ordering a medium 'Canada, Eh?' pizza. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner for the next 3 days then lol!
