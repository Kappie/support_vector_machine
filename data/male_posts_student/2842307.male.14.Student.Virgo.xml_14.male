Life is cruel, it doesn't allow time for silly mistakes.  We, the new batch of leaders, will have to watch our every movement from now on. So many watchful eyes, no space to make a small mistake and get sent out of class.  We got to lead by example. . .  Even though we will have to sacrifice a lot, we will do it not only for our own sake, but for the sake of the rest of our juniors.  We will uphold our morales and be the ideal SJI Military Bandsman, one who knows his limits. One who has fierce loyalty to his close friends and to the Band. One who is trustworthy and honest.
