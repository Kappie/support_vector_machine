There was eight of us in total and it was a lot of fun.  I'm a pretty good bowler and I wasn't doing very well the first game.  Found out I was a little off in my deliverer and was a little off from where I needed to start.  So the first game I scored a 61, which was rather awful.  But next game I made the adjustment and bowled a 120, yay!  It isn't my highest score tho.  I believe my highest score is some where near 142.  I almost got a turkey, and that was pretty awesome.  After spending that night with the most awesome person in the world, aka Lindsay Hines, I went home called her up and asked her out so yay we are going out now.  So that's extremely awesome, so life is awesome!  Hope yours is too!
