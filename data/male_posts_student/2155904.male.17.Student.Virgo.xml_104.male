Whatever that might be.  Tyke had to get up early (10AM) today for he was going to do some more of his "Community Experience" if you can call it that.  He left his house about 11 to go down to downtown Seattle and the plush KING5 studios.  It is really exhilirating knowing that you know the place and the people and they at least sort of know you and are at least familiar with you.  A great feeling to know that you are known at a place that is influential.  Anyways, he just hung out with his guy there for about 6 hours.  It was pretty boring actually today.  He just sat around and read some sports mags for a while and watched a little TV.  Then he learned how to edit some stuff and he gave his input on a few stories that are in progress.  Later on he watched some tapes of high school basketball games looking for a certain player and some achievements.  He learned how to use that equipment too.  All in all that was pretty cool.  But he didn't go down to Key Arena today.  On Saturday he might though.  Since the 'Nics have a game then, he is gonna go down to KING and probably go down to the Key.  So that should be cool.  Tyke went out to his car after leaving and saw that somebody had hit his left headlight thingy (not the headlight but the little turn signal thing to the left of it) and the plastic glass crap was broken off.  The light bulbs still work so it isn't a deal, just an aesthetic thing.  And Tyke's car isn't exactly a beauty anyway so he doesn't really care.  Well Tyke went to BK on the way home and sat in there and ate dinner by himself.  It was kind of weird eating dinner in a fast food restaurant by himself.  He rarely, if ever, does that anymore.  But tonight he did it.  And he did it well.  Then he went home and talked to his parents for a little while and then played some PS2 as he waited for Macaroon.  They played a little PS2 and then D-Cups came over so they played Shithead and 13.  Both were fun games.  And then BS which was cool cuz Tyke ended up not losing by cheating (in the rules cheating though) and winning.  It was great.  Then they played some games and Tyronious came over.  He brought some ice cream so they ate that.  Mmmm...ice cream.  Then they played some Soul Calibur and more PS2 and then they left.  And then Tyke blogged.  And then Tyke slept.  Oh wait, that is coming up next.  Stay tuned for the rest of the adventures after this short 24 hour break...
