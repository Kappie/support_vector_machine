Sitting in a cold afternoon, just a blanket on my legs, a cup of hot cocoa and my fav book on the side. I'm outside, under the pine trees of Vermont looking the sunset and the way the sun touches the great fall foliage. I keep staring at nothing, just calmed by the beauty of it all. A rush of wind makes music as it passes through pine needles. Is a chilly music, calming. I look by my side and there's the guy I'm in love with, sharing the moment and handing me a marshmallow. He leans to rest his head on my shoulder. Kiss his head, smell his hair. It's getting late. I'm in love! I'm being loved!   ....   At 32, Liam seems to be the perfect guy for me, at least on paper. Much is to do and say about my relationship with him. All I can say at the moment has to do with the way he makes me feel and the way he seems to respond. We are getting to know each other, in this almost two months dating, we had had some bumps in the road, but we try to drive around them with maturity, a thing that has been lacking in my previous relations. Is it perfect because he is older, wiser than me? Maybe not, and is not perfect at all; we started this in a slow and busy way, we were not deep in all of it, we didn't care for each other in that special way, and that's, maybe, the perfect way of being, the perfect way of starting, because there's no way to go from there but up. We'll see. Spending weekends with him in SD just made me realize how in tune he is with his emotions, how calm, how demure he is. I like that. Finally I'm dating not a guy, I'm dating a man. One that's a match intellectually and emotionally.
