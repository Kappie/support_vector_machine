Jeff Foxworthy has been releasing albums since the immensely popular  You Might Be a Redneck If...  in 1991.  This album, his fifth album of new material, may be his last according to the acknowledging liner notes.  That hasn't stopped the comedian from churning out some great material.  For instance, everybody knows about the Cialis ad from the Super Bowl, but only Foxworthy would comment that if he were in the hospital, he would make sure to wear the robe backwards and walk around.  Larry the Cable Guy makes a few unnecessary cameos in the CD during the introduction and encore, but he seems to enhance the CD this time.  He doesn't just yell "Git 'er done!" every two seconds, either.  The only qualm about this is that some of the material can be seen on  Blue Collar Comedy Tour , but all the repeated bits are absent from the soundtrack.  All the audio is new for those whom do not prefer movies.  Rating: 4.5/5
