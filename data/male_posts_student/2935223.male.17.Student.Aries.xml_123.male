That's alright, all you returning people probably don't wanna hang out with me anyway...*pity moment*  Well...glad that's over.  hm..what to talk about?  THE PERFECT SCORE:  great, GREAT movie.  Possibly just as awesome as....  Harold and Kumar go to White Castle: Another really awesome movie, really frickin' funny...but have a few extra bucks on ya....'cause you're gonna wanna eat White Castle afterwards....let me tell you. It was awesome,  Steve, Kyle, and I went to that movie...then when it was done we all wanted White Castle REALLY REALLY BAD!  So we went outside, got in the car, and asked this group of people where the nearest White Castle was.  Then we went there and ate....and it was pretty good.  Dispite the fact that I  hate White Castle.   There was one thing that the Perfect Score had that Harold and Kumar didn't.   Scarlett Johansson:  the uberly hott gothic punk chick from the Perfect Score.  Oh my JEEBUS...I can't get over it......damn.  Hm....what else...........I dunno. The only reason I'm updating this is because I was threatened with Potatoing if I didn't....:-S  Otherwise I porbably woulda left that other post, just to see ho many posts I could get......n'stuff.  Thursday, at like 11...Tascha, Gloria, Ky, and I went swimming...it was kool.  It's really hard to swim with huge baggy pants on....so I ditched them at one point...then felt really uncomfortable...so I went and got them back.  I'm such a douche fuck.  It's ok....I still like me. hm....what else happened?  I dunno.. I hafta eat lunch and take a shower now though :-D  ugh ugh...Spenser stinky.  *belches*  This Caveman Minute has been brought to you by:  Our Family Mini Beef Ravioli in Tomato  Meat Sauce.

If anyone is doin' anythin' today or tonight...or anytime in the near future.
