But the pain matters doesn't it? Pain makes us who we are. Without it   we would be lost, adrift in a sea with no shore. Pain is life in a way.   But that doesn't make it better. Or make it hurt less. Because it   hurts. We all know that. It hurts in ways so deep they cannot even be   contemplated. It threatens your very essence. But you can never let it   stop you or even slow you down. Because if you do you will find it   impossible to start again. And the next step from there is that   inviting bottle of pills.....   But, you say, but what are you talking about? Pain is a purely physical   thing. The sting of a cut or throbbing of a bruise. I say you lie. The   pain I speak of is much more than that. This is the pain that is far   more potent than anything purely physical could ever be. I speak of   your mind. Of your feelings, hopes and dreams. I speak of what it feels   like when these things are shattered. All in one instant everything is   gone. Lost with only scars to leave their white hot trails across your   mind. And you say pain doesn't matter? Those who speak so are the lucky   few. For they are the ones who have never experienced this. The few who   have never felt true pain.   But I say again. We as a race need pain. We could not survive without   it. We seek it out and revel in it. Not consciously perhaps but we do   all the same. And often, even when we realise where it will all lead we   continue. Why? Because the pain is only what you make of it. And should   I choose to make love to that pain, am I truly wrong?
