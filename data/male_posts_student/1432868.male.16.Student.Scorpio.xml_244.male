What is really great is that The Flaming lips go all out in remixing being one of the first sacd or dvd to take full advantage of surround sound. The almost created new songs in the process. The circling drum kit of Yoshimi vs the pink robots pt.1 gives a different feel then in the original album version. It is probably one of the better music purchases I made. Best 20 bucks spent last year.
