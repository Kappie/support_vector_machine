That's not even the worst part, they threatened to turn the debt over to a collection agency if it wasn't settled within seven days, that's what seriously ticked me off. Because, if they did hand it over my mom is somehow hooked up to my account so they would've screwed up my mom's credit on purpose. I'm serious when I say "those bastards." Of course this is all my fault and I took care of it right away. Somehow when I opened up the letter that told me how much I owed, my mom could tell it was gonna be beyond her comprehension of how it came to that amount if she found out. So, the following day I rode my butt down to the bank and took out a twenty, rode my butt home and then my mom rode my butt all the way to the library. It's still hard for myself to believe that I paid them thirty dollars that day. I figure I've paid so many fines since I was six years old that I've set a record or paid for numerous coffee table books. I've still got nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents to pay off, maybe I could stuff envelopes.
