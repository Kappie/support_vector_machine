I'm not sure how it will turn out, but it's the beginning of a new adventure. Everything is new. There is no path that I am blocked from. An adventurer, that's what I am now.  Commencement today, as I watched the awesome raising of the flag, the rivalship between the business school and the engineering school, the massive people, I fell in love with life again. The music provided a soundtrack, and now I'm ready. All my old friends are married. New friends await. And so do many, many women. Tomorrow is the first Monday of the new chapter.
