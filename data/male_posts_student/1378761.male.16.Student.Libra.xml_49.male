He was off today because he was suppose to have jury duty, but in the end they did not need him. So we did a lil shopping. Update to the last post of mine: I got in my DVD burner. Ha I burnt like 6 movies and downloaded Shrek 2 so I got a couple of movies to watch lol. We are taking a mini vacation this weekend. Saturday is my cousin's college graduation party. That is all the way in Michigan so that is why we are talking a mini-vacation. We are leaving Thurday morning and going to my step-dad's employer's cabin somewere near lake Erie. We are going to Ceder Point Thurday or Friday, depending on the weather. Then Saturday morning we are leaving and going to Dundee to shop at Cabelas. After that we are going to go to the graduation party that evening. After the party we are going back to the caben to stay the night, then back on the road Sunday morning. I have to work Sunday night so we got to be back by 4 because I got to work with my favoritest co-worker Ashley (ha now she thinks she is a big shot cause she is gonna be manager, so we will just let her think that). Looks like I got to go up to the school Wedensday to meet with Mr. Spencer. Just talked to him on the net. I am going to copy a tape from the fire department and grab a dell editing computer while I am up there. My cell phone is dead. It was beeping for the longest time, so now it just shut off. Thought I should put that in there. I have been working on this for a couple of hours.  I had to re-cut and tape my brothers tape. The VCR eat his Dragonball Z tape. Prob cause he watches it soo much lol.   I am starting to work on my movie. It is going to be a full-feature production. My new production company is "Twilight Productions" (website comming soon!!). I don't have much info to give out right now about the movie. Once I get the site done there will be some info on there. My movie will prob be called "One Last Chance". It will be focused on a highschool kid range, yet good enough for an adult. More info on that later though.  Thats it for now. Until we meet again, this has been another Twilight Production **ERIC**
