When I was asleep on the couch, he woke me up at 10pm blasting the music on MTV in the room I was in. Lucky that got him grounded.  Sleep is sacred in our family. If anyone wakes another person up, and they complain, it's an automatic grounding.  Anyway, I walked up to my bed and laid down 5 minutes later at 10:05. I fell right asleep.  I woke up after a weird dream at 6am. What the heck? I never wake up at that time. Ever. I tried going back to sleep and that strangely continued my dream until I woke up at 11am.  Okay, that's more normal. But now I've slept for  sixteen hours ?!  Strange thing is that I'm still tired. I just woke up anyway. So that might be the case. Sixteen hours of sleep? That's weird. I'll see if I get too much sleep again tonight.  Sixteen hours. Usually I get about 8-9 hours and one of my brothers wake me up to play on the computer, which is in my room.  I don't know how I slept for sixteen hours, but it was a waste of my day.
