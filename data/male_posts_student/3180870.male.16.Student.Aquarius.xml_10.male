I stopped at Best Buy, Comp USA, Sports Authority, and Trader Joe's. Trader Joe's is very cool but something about it made me not wanna work there. Sports Authority is even worse, they don't have an application to fill out but a a device that was three times as big as a PDA and a had a keyboard and something else but I forgot. The whole store is just a turn off. Leaving Best Buy and Comp USA. Best Buy has an online application too but some thing about the workers and store was weird. Maybe too laid back? Well that leaves Comp USA which is probably the hardest place to get a job out of these four. A reason it might be hard to get hired is that hardly anyone was shopping there. They were overstaffed when I was there. I'm still going to apply, but only to Comp USA and Best Buy. All I have to do now is figure out exactly the time period I will not be able to work as a cause of vacation and my sister's surgery. I'm aiming to get my applications in by this Saturday. By the way, I'm still working on the soap project and should be getting some envelopes to fill very soon.
