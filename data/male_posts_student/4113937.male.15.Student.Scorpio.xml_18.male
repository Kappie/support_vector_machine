Morning went to send my sister and her husband to Japan, they are so relax even though they are going on the business trip.  Just hope that next time, it will happen to me also.  Went back to school during, didn't went to take the pink form. Feel very bad but no choice, i scared of detention, it very boring thing.  After school, helping out at the sec 3 with the POP, it just brought me back to last year when i was the PC than.  Got a lot of help from the sir and mdm.  This time round, it time to pass down to them.  Hope they will be able to make it! So people will have a different eyes on them.  Overall, they are quite funny, keep laughing all the way one.  Cannot be serious, must scold all the time.  Esp the Sophiana, the MC, damn funny.. she is always giving us joke to laugh about, the eye when she turn over, so all the best! The sec 2 was really giving my heartache when i saw them got some problem over the I/C stuff, not everyone in life will given the chance, so don't need to worry, i make sure you all will be able to take charge from time to time.  So don't let us see you all separated when we going to pop, it a very sad thing to see for us! haha.. than happen to us when Mdm huiying and Mingwei left us, lucky they don't know about it when they left.  So, come on sec 2, be more united together ok? haha.. The sec1 was still really very cheerful and fun, be more serious for sec 1! haha.. okay.. shall stop the stuff liao, if not i will become a grandfather nagging.  After that, went back home to rest, really very sick now, the flu is not getting any better, and the cough was getting better.  Sleeping with the flu was really very hard, like cannot breathe, haha.. so okay.. my grandma went to hositpal again today, she keep complaining that her back it very pain, so the thing we can do now is to send her to hositpal, my mum went also, than father no at home, no one company to see doctor.  Pan is the med than i need now.. damn sick.. see ya!
