Hmmm....PW stress gettin' higher and higher...with surveys to do...and I have to go back to my school to interview?!? *Sigh* I just do hope the DM will accept me...or else I'll face the consequences again. Wednesday...a rather relaxing day but with time to waste as well. ((Well...I'm currently doin' my tutorials and it ain't gettin' anywhere....!!!))  Haven't written an entry on fanfiction.net for a rather long time; should begin to write a new chapter as soon as all of these mess is cleared up. =/ And tomorrow's a long day as well...with MATHS again as the last tutorial which is so damn boring too! Lookin' at the GundamSeed OST makes me feel.....nothing??? Hahaha...that joke was GAY~! ((Nvm...I'm a student of gayness. [Koped from KG Goh] =P ))  難しい…難しい…明日が、だからタスックが必ず続きますよ…クタバレな！明日の中国語レッソンじゃないことがいいで、大丈夫になります！イマのミュシックが玉置奈実の“ＲＥＡＬＩＺＥ”歌で、歌がいいですな！だけど、ミューシックを永遠に聞くことが真実にじゃないよ。島谷ひとみの新しい“ＤＥＬＩＣＩＯＵＳ”アルバムがほしい、アルバムがちょっと安くなかったそうだけど。そして、浜崎あゆみの最新な“ＩＮＳＰＩＲＥ”シンガーもほしい、今月２７日になって出発します。  *Sigh* Demo...homuwookuu ga arukara, atarashii CDs wo kain-masenyo. Okay...looks like it's time to wrap up for tonight. It's been a long day too. Okay then...tata~~! =]
