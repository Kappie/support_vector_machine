I've got a few plans for the break, but I'll mention those later.  Recap: Math: WHOA!! That test was so damned easy... I think I actually passed! lol, I actually think I got a perfect on it. boy would that be nice.  Band: I actually got a solo on the opening blues today-that was fun. BASS OUT!  English: For the love of GOD, why do we have hour and a half PLUS 5 minutes of ENGLISH!!!! English is the devil... I now officially have 28 note cards.  With the start of spring break come my sister's two guinea pigs that are at school. That ought to be fun-last time I had them here, my dog took a crap in their bin...how lovely...  That's one of the things I'm not really looking forward too much, but they're kinda cool. The things I'm looking forward to, in chronological order: 1. (maybe) seeing the Cottage Grove Junior High spring plays Friday night 2. The Underground!!! I need to work on my pool shots... 3. Not doing any homework this Sunday. 4. Seeing "Secret Window" 5. Seeing "Ladykillers" with my sister 6. Watching LOTR (for all you good movie illiterate people, LOTR=lord of the rings) with Amanda. 7. Arrival of my Grandparents. 8. The Underground!!! for a second time, if I'm not doing something else with my nightlife... i.e. playing "greedy" with my grandpa lol. 9. Not having to wake up terribly early for a week. 10. Looking forward to some quality time off to do what I want to without my parents on my back all the time.  Yep, Spring Break is almost here!!! God knows we ALL need it...
