It's about a man that's already 32 years and he never left home.  I didn't just relax and see the movie but I also kept an eye on all the details like the colors, the symbols, the music and the senses. It's nice to watch a movie from that point of view. You learn a lot like this. Senses   Seeing  -binoculars  -peep show  -television  -spying on girls (bald mountain scene). Meisjes worden graag bespied. --zus  -looking into shop windows (when Abel is on the street)  -looking out of the window (when Abel is in appartement)  -looking thru fish-eye lense (father)  -voyeurism   Smell   -mother smelling Abel's shirt on Zus  -het stinkt hier (Victor)  -arme mensen ruiken naar aardappelen  -taste  -eating fish all the time, many eating scenes   Color usage: Dark blue and green at parent's house and light hues and lots of red in Zus's place
