The main reason we went was to play basketball, but the Y had to be retarded and kick us out after an hour. And even in that hour, we couldn't really play a game since there were already kids playing a full court game and of course they couldn't share the court. After playing basketball....er shooting hoops....er shooting hoops whenever there was room to, we went to play raquetball. Which really didn't go over well. So basically we just sat around. Which was sorta interesting. I've learned a few things that really annoy me: 1. calling me Jonathan. Just say Jon. It's much easier and sounds better. 2. being followed around wherever I go. 3. being bugged by people to climb a rock wall when clearly I stated I didn't want to about 30 times. 4. running on a treadmill without stretching or warming up. 5. being poked. So there you have it. If you do any of these, run. So after our little trip to the YMCA, I went bowling at (ugh) Valley Lanes. Those lanes are horrible. Either your ball hooks too much, doesn't hook at all, or you put hook on it but it goes straight at the last moment. But I beat you AshLEY, remember that. So now after a fun filled day, I'm here recovering from it. I could barely get out of bed let alone move. My legs burn, my arms burn, my whole body is pretty sore. By the way, I should get a prize for having the most boring blog ever. Perhaps someone would buy me...   But I guess that would be wishful thinking. I really want tickets to go see the Knicks play the Sixers in March, so there's another idea for all you people who are looking for gift ideas for me. What occasion is it? Absolutely nothing. But it would be nice to either receive a guitar or NBA tickets on any random day. By the way, the bass in Around the World is crazy. I suggest all of you out there to be enlightened and start listening to good music. Blam that rap and r crap. Listen to stuff like H.I.M, System of a Down, Thrice, Misfits, etc.. Ok I'm out for now. Later.  Listen to H.I.M.
