I practiced with various combinations of Laura, Chad, Amy, and Megan today for a total of about two hours, and as a whole, we no longer look like crap.  Millenium is a different story.  If they don't improve by next year, I'm going to shoot myself or join band.  Freshman aren't supposed to be perfect, but these guys are absurd.  There is on e guy with any facial expression whatsoever.  Problem is, he's the worst dancer of the lot.   And that's saying a lot.  Most of them are two or three beats behind, and their movements are either lazy and half-hearted or jerky and disconnected.  Or both.  Oh, and they're not singing either.  Basically, if this is the future of the Lawrence North choir program, we're screwed.  Oh, and by the way, I'm not putting the name of the show in the title anymore.  It's too cluttered.   I'll add it to the end of the post.  If anyone wants to know, this one's from Songs for a New World.  And I deleted the stupid signature line.  It's tacky and blatantly untrue.
