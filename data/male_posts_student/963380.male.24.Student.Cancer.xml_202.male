And to add insult to the salt in the wound (mixed metaphor? check) it kept spinning. My head began to pound. I felt like I was going to be sick.  I had a hangover.  Problem is, I hadn't had a drop to drink (double whammy aliteration? check). I crawled up two flights of stairs and knelt before the toilet (note to self, toilet in basement much nicer to vomit in, toilet upstairs has thinner rim, less beneficial to rest head on. Also, less cooling.) I could see in the mirror that I had no colour to speak of, even my freckles had dropped shades becoming a sort of perlescent pink in favour of their usually melatonin orange.  I could not be sick.  I think that not being sick, in the instance where one should be sick, is indeed worse than being sick itself. The grumbling stomach that iterates it's intentions of rewinding the peristaltic process and producing your breakfast, lunch or dinner in an unceremonious presentation (check, check aaaaand check). The nausea that sweeps through every fibre of your being informs you that the sights and smells you are about to encounter should not be witness by those untrained in the medical arts. The heaving, of the dry variety, strips your throat of moisture and your person of dignity. A fine ballet of ghastly gastronomical gestations that births precisely squat. It's one of the most humiliating moments of being human.  I managed to haul myself to bed and ingest a pair of No-Name(tm) brand gravol substitutes which through some act of God had hidden themselve in my bedside table. Two little pink tablets and a pint of water later the room began to slow.  As I got off the Merry-Go-Round that was my perception of the world at that given moment I contemplated what I'd eaten today that varied from days before.  Feta cheese.  It's always the fucking Greeks, isn't it?
