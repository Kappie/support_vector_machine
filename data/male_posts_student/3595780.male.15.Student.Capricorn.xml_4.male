I must say the best part about the whole trip was that one of my friends packed in real potatoes and steak and mm-mmm was it good. We didn't even get rained on the whole time even though it was overcast and poured the night after we got bunked down for bed. Granted it was a little muddy. but what the hey, it's okay it's America. Later.   urlLink My Homepage
