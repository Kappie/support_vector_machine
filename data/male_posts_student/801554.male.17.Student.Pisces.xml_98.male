       
      I can't write in the morning. For some reason my juices take a while to thaw, if you know what I mean. I tend to do my best writing right before I go to bed. Which is nice, because I go to bed with a nice air of self-satisfaction.  Right now I'm working on a short story about the Creator of the Universe.  More later, as always.
