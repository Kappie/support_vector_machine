When I plan to do serious reading, I can be a voracious reader. :) Of late, I have not really done that, but anyways...  If I have to choose between party hopping at the best hangout in town/watching a hit movie at a cool cinema house AND reading something interesting, I have no doubt I would go for the latter.  Coming back to the point, here are some non-fiction books that I recommend reading:  1. "It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life" by Lance Armstrong, 4-time winner of Tour De France  This is an out and out inspirational story about Lance's fight with cancer and how he overcame all odds to compete and win the greatest bicycle race in the world.  I was myself able to draw a fair bit of inspiration. :) Here is Amazon's review that best describes the book: "People around the world have found inspiration in the story of Lance Armstrong--a world-class athlete nearly struck down by cancer, only to recover and win the Tour de France, the multiday bicycle race famous for its grueling intensity. Armstrong is a thoroughgoingTexan jock, and the changes brought to his life by his illness are startling and powerful, but he's just not interested in wearing a hero suit. While his vocabulary is a bit on the he-man side (highest compliment to his wife: "she's a stud"), his actions will melt the most hard-bitten souls: a cancer foundation and benefit bike ride, his astonishing commitment to training that got him past countless hurdles, loyalty to the people and corporations that never gave up on him. There's serious medical detail here, which may not be for the faint of heart; from chemo to surgical procedures to his wife's in vitro fertilization, you won't be spared a single x-ray, IV drip, or unfortunate side effect. Athletes and coaches everywhere will benefit from the same extraordinary detail provided about his training sessions--every aching tendon, every rainy afternoon, and every small triumph during his long recovery is here in living color. It's Not About the Bike is the perfect title for this book about life, death, illness, family, setbacks, and triumphs, but not especially about the bike."  The next couple of books are related to mountaineering. My newly found craze and fascination for the subject was in a way responsible as to why I chose to read these books. The interesting fact about these books is that all are true and highly gripping stories, written and explained with intricate details. Morevoer, one does not need to have any knowledge about mountaineering to read them. Especially, the first book by Krakauer is quite amazing!  2. "Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster" by Jon Krakauer.  Amazon's Review: Into Thin Air is a riveting first-hand account of a catastrophic expedition up Mount Everest. In March 1996, Outside magazine sent veteran journalist and seasoned climber Jon Krakauer on an expedition led by celebrated Everest guide Rob Hall. Despite the expertise of Hall and the other leaders, by the end of summit day eight people were dead. Krakauer's book is at once the story of the ill-fated adventure and an analysis of the factors leading up to its tragic end. Written within months of the events it chronicles, Into Thin Air clearly evokes the majestic Everest landscape. As the journey up the mountain progresses, Krakauer puts it in context by recalling the triumphs and perils of other Everest trips throughout history. The author's own anguish over what happened on the mountain is palpable as he leads readers to ponder timeless questions."  3.  "Epic: Stories of Survival from the World's Highest Peaks" - by Jon Krakauer, Greg Child (Contributor), Stephan Venables, Art    Davidson, David Roberts, Alfred Lansing, Eric Conger (Narrator), Rick Adamson (Narrator), Graeme Malcolm, Alan Sklar (Reader), Clint Willis (Editor), Stephen Venables.  Amazon's Review: "Some of the most exciting and harrowing mountaineering events ever chronicled are collected in Epic. From Jon Krakauer's solo ascent of Devil's Thumb in Alaska to John Climaco's account of being threatened by a homicidal Pakistani army officer in the Himalayas, these are stories of survival in nature's most inhospitable places."  The final two recommended reads are actually Marathi books. :) I used to read a lot of Marathi during my school and early college days. And I bought this one during my recent trip to India. Even if there might be English editions of these books, if you like reading Marathi, I can guarantee that English versions won't have the same punch as the Marathi ones.  4. "Shreeman Yogi" by Ranjit Desai.  This famous book is a bible in itself, with more than 1000 pages dedicated to Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire in the mid-1600s. The book contains an absolutely fabulous description of the 1600s Maratha history, and includes every detail related to the birth, life and death of the great warrior. I hope I can finish reading this book sometime; it is so HUGE, the history is so complex, I am hardly half way into it at this point. But its worth it!!  5. "Panchavanna Kotinche Balee" by Gopal Godse.  This is a book written by the brother of Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. Gopal himself was one of the conspirators in Gandhi's assassination. The book is all about why and how the Godse brothers killed Mahatama Gandhi and also contains a long draft written by Nathuram himself, explaining his stance in the assassination. I chose this book plainly out of curiosity to know more about the the reasons and the plot behind the killing. I did not read this from a point of view of an Anti-Gandhi or a For-Gandhi (I prefer to act neutral when it comes to discussing politics). But anyways, it makes for an interesting read. I must say that some of the stuff described is pretty hard to comprehend, not only because of the high quality of Marathi used :), but also because of some of the historical ambiguities and controversial descriptions. Again, being history, that is bound to happen.  Happy Reading, folks!
