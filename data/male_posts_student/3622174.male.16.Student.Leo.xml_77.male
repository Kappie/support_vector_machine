Not that I want school to start or anything, but, it has gone by so slow that I have run out of things to do.  Drivers Ed is over, so I don't have to waste my time on that anymore, but, at the same time, I have nothing to waste my time on, except maybe to sit at my computer all day like a loser.    But, anyway, I found out my whole schedule yesterday. There was a conflict with my yearbook scheduling, and they had me scheduled for first period yearbook.  Definitely not happening.  So, me and the registrar at the school worked it out so that I would be in yearbook with everyone else, and we ended up flopping pretty much my entire schedule.  Not really a problem, I like it better the way it is now.  At least I'll get to leave CRHS with a full blown Mr. Teter experience!    I'm finally feeling not-sick now.  Maybe it was just one of those 48-hour things, or maybe its not gone, just giving me a little break.  I don't know.  But I feel a little bit better today.  I need to go to Universal sometime soon.  It's been such a long time since I've gone, and I need to get down there.  Especially since Revenge of the Mummy is now open.  I've been looking forward to that ride ever since I first heard about it a couple years ago.  It's going to be pretty interesting, and I can't wait to get on it.    Well, its only 7:30, and I'm already up, and I don't want to be.  But I can't fall back asleep, so I might as well just stay by my computer and be bored all day.  If you're lucky, I'll probably update again tonight, but, we'll see.
