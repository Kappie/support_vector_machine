It was a beautiful day so after that I chilled outside on my bench and continued reading a book.  I fell asleep outside for about 15 minutes and the wind kicked in. I went back to my room and took a nap for an hour. Then at around 5pm me, kev, Zach, and Erek went to the bookstore downtown to return our books for beer money. I only got back $15 for the soc book and they wouldn’t take back the other two books because they “aren’t using them next semester.” Whatever. We then went hiking up in the Catskills. Erek and I were being “morons” by rock climbing and going into caves, which were off limits. Free rock climbing was such a rush,  for a few moments I feared for my life . But I loved it, it was soo much fun. I have a lot of pictures IM me if you want to see them. We then picked up jeff and went to taco bell for dinner. By the time we got back it was 9pm and I still had to shower and get ready to go to “The Post.” I started drinking at club 21 at around 930pm and we couldn’t find the funnel. We looked all over and it was nowhere to be found.  It was 1030 and I wasn’t drunk yet and I wasn’t going to the post sober because it’s very hard to drink there if you’re under 21. midnight came and josh found the funnel and people poured into the room. The party started. We all passed around two bowls and one funnel.  Everyone was fucked up . Me and james had a rap freestyle battle that lasted for an hour. The rhymes I spit weren’t very good, but it was so much fun. Left club 21 at about 4am and ate some food and passed the hell out.  Saturday night everyone was highly anticipating a call from Dan, for a double kegger at his house. 8pm came and no word. I began funneling beers with Emily, Karla, and Lauren Pot. Erek called me and asked where I was, I was in his room, where was he, in my room being bored. 9pm came and we all started making other plans to go out to the club because no one could get in touch with Dan. We improvised and use the white pages to get his home phone. He was fucking sleeping the whole time! So we wait a little while for him to arrive and then Andrew and Xavier show up. Dan finally arrives at 10 ish and we all pack into 4 separate cars and pull up mafia style to his house. Two kegs, one huge tent, about 30 people already there quietly drinking standing around.  UAlbany comes there and we start doing keg stands, flip cup, funnels and basically are loud rowdy drunk mother fuckers . We basically brought the party to life it was amazing. I did two keg stands for the first time ever. The first one lasted 16 seconds and the second one was only 6 seconds. Half the Albany crew left that night, I gave Lauren Pot my seat in the car and stayed there. I went back into the house and tried to get another rap freestyle going, but it didn’t happen. I passed out of the couch shortly after.  Sunday we drove back to UAlbany at about noon. I get back and Andrew and Xavier crashed up in Erek’s room. I discovered that the night b4  Xavier got pulled over in the parking lot and passed many sobriety tests . Funny shit. We decide to go to the international house of pancakes, but the line was so long we just decided to go to Johnny Rockets. It was very good but the bill came out to a lot more than we expected and it took forever to scavenge up the money to pay, oh well. The guys left at around 4pm and I did nothing for the rest of the day.  I’m going to miss the hell out of Albany. Freshman year here was by far the best time of my life. Here are some random good times: the first night we went to a frat party and got drunk, the second night here we went to a frat party and stumbled back home, the free keg beer frat parties with free lap dances from dirty ass strippers, the many many hookups, “the lgndry nite of lsbnsm in cooper 207”,  the godfather, 420, the $200+ beer/liquor runs, the mud slides, skipping class every morning, wake and bakes, endless games of flip cup and beer pong, the ghetto drug war, the tunnels on shrooms, fountain day madness, CS lan games, the night I drunk beer and straight whiskey, leaving psych class to vomit outside the lecture hall, my drunken birthday, robot dancing, ghetto dancing, running down 21 floors for fire drills, coming up with the nickname “disco bob”, Italian food night at chartwells, thong on the wall, winning two texas holdem tournaments up in the penthouse, you got that crack, the walk of shame, chocolate penis in the dining hall, committing felonies, I’m rick james bitch, dancing yatta, holdem holdem holdem, power hour, and there’s a lot more shit that went down but  I’ll always remember the nights I spent with the friends I’ll never forget!  I’ll see all you mother fuckers next semester in CLUB 306!!!!!!!  Everyone who is coming to Six Flags this Friday, meet at my house at 830 AM !  To my Albany boys and girls.. HAVE A SMUTTY SUMMER !
