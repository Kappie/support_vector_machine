Sweet was waiting patiently for a person (let's name this person "Chocolate") at a certain MRT station in Singapore. Chocolate sent Sweet an SMS stating that Chocolate will be late so Sweet waited for around 15 to 20 minutes. They always been wanted to meet up each other since long time ago, the story goes like this. Back then, they get to know each other in IRC. Sweet was fascinated by Chocolate's nickname,  Sweet then first private message Chocolate. And from there, they got each other MSN's contact, self-photo, etc...  From that time onwards, they have been chatting in MSN for almost 8 months. During those days, they had so far chatted on the phone for 3 to 4 times before only. What was keeping them hestitate to meet is because Sweet was busy of school stuff, so they never really got the chance to meet until the June's vacation. One day, Sweet initiated to meet up with Chocolate for a simple dinner in a shopping mall.  During the first time meeting, Sweet was playing game on the handphone when Chocolate approached. After a few talks, they proceeded into the mall. They weren't sure of what activity they can do, as Sweet had already eaten at home and Chocolate had a few bite in school already. So they just walked around and window-shopped while on the way talking about fashion, music and even food.  After finished going through all the stores, Chocolate suggested to Sweet whether if Sweet wants to go to the nearby park. Without much thinking, Sweet agreed since they were not feeling hungry. In the park, the lighting were dull and romantic. They took a stroll to the shelter and sitted on the bench, the shelter was bright and Chcolate was trying to sit intimately near to Sweet, who was feeling being squeezed. Sweet thought it would be polite just to slant to the left for more space instead of body contacting towards Chocolate. They both then started chatting, it was very silence as the chat was not continously non-stop, there were a few pauses which held up a few seconds to a minute. Both of them did not know what to chat, they were trying to break the "ice" so they asked and talked about their school stuff. The "ice" in Sweet was indeed very hard and tough to break for Chocolate. Chocolate tried to touch Sweet by holding Sweet's hand up, commented that Sweet had such long fingernails.  In the mean time, Sweet knew that Chocolate wanted to intimate with Sweet. Then they started to hanky panky around and occasionally joking in the conversation, one thing Sweet will never forget is that Chocolate always picked the pest, insects or whatever dirt away from Sweet's t-shirt. Sweet said to Chocolate he was like a monkey helping their fellow to pick away the lices. Till late, Sweet started to feel tired and requested Chocolate to lend Chocolate's shoulder for Sweet to lie Sweet's head on it. But during that time, Sweet was worried people might see. However Sweet didn't care much as Sweet don't want to miss the opportunity to lie on Chocolate's shoulder. Sweet had never felt so comfortable lying on a person's body, they went quiet just to enjoy the moment.  After that, Chocolate kept glaring directly on Sweet's face, it made Sweet shy and Sweet just turned away after a while. This was the time Chocolate made the first move, he initiatively asked whether if Chocolate can kiss Sweet. Without much hestitation, Sweet replied yes and said "Before that, which part are you going to kiss?". Chocolate wouldn't dare replied and replied sweet with a question "You guess?", Sweet then guessed it was the lips and bingo! So Chocolate asked if Chocolate can kiss and Sweet allowed.  But never did Sweet know, it wasn't a peck(To kiss briefly and casually). It was a French kiss that Chocolate gave, this was the first time Sweet received such a kiss. Sweet was kind of surprised. Sweet interrupted the few seconds of kiss into a hug. Eventually, they realised it was quite late already so Chocolate gave Sweet one last deep kiss again before they leave. Soon after, they returned home. Sweet by MRT and Chocolate by bus.  Finally they managed to get rid of the "ice", not by breaking it. It was by melting it, which Chocolate had succeeded by melting Sweet's heart with his romantic surprise.
