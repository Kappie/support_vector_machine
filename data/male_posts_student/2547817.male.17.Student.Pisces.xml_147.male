I wrote a perfectly good entry for this blog, and I hit spell check and the bloody thing hung, taking all my work to hell. Bitch.  I was walking out of school with Joel and we were talking about how much love hurts. We as teens think our world is the world.  We know shit. There was this lady we met on the bus. I know about her because of one of my juniors. She was talking very loudly to everyone on the bus. She was driven nuts coz of bitter divorce proceedings. Love's damage extends far beyond the boundaries of thump thump lub dub emotion. Like I said, we teens think we've got it bad.  We know SHIT.  I'm pissed coz I'm getting dissed by Jo. It's sad. I tell the truth and I get dissed. Sound familiar? Maybe it's just girls. Hell! What is it with the I'm-going-to-be-pissed-at-you-because-I-wish-to-express-my-discontent shit man?! I don't understand it!  On a happy note, Leon almost got into the finals for his swimming competition. He missed it by only 1.something seconds. Good on him ay! What the hell is he not good at?  Dance was on today. I hate dance but I have to learn. It will help me impress judges.  I'm sorry that tonight's entry is sub-standard reader. I'm not having a good time.
