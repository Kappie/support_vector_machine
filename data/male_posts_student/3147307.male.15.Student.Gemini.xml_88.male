So, here I am at, let's see, 11:17pm writing my first post. Got it in today by 43 minutes. Busy day tomorrow. I run in my first 5k of the year at 8. I'm hoping to crack 20:30. And then the movie - but the rumor is Joe's gonna be a no-show! How can that be? Also, I don't think Allen and Zach can come till late. :( Is this a bad omen?  In Groundhog Day when Phil Conners (Bill Murray) steals the Groundhog.  Andie MacDowell as Rita (Phil's boss) ... "Why would anyone steal a groundhog?" Larry (Phil's co-worker) ... "I can probaly think of a couple reasons .. pervert."  urlLink Listen to the quote here
