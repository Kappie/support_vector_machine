It used to, but now it's just a futal attempt to make myself feel better.  Shyama told me today that the 10 have been selected. That means the end of the line Tim. Worthlessness itself has more value than what I percieve myself to be at this instant. 24 of us were in round two and only 10 got choosen for round 3. I thought to myself, if i got to round 3, it wouldn't matter if I got it anymore because by then I would have prooved to myself my worth. What really hurts is that ALL the people in the scholarship to whom I was colse with got selected for the third round. Jolyn, Sahrmini, Leon, Shyama, Shawn. Dammit! Why was I not worth it?!   This entity - Life - is not a kind soul. ONE mistake and it kicks you in the ass! I wish i could hit rewind. I want to change it. The worst part of having my close friends selected is that there is a very high chance that I might loose some of them. Somebody help me please. It's pent up and I'm going to crash and burn soon.
