People think that they arn't dilligent and can't comply with teenager confontations, such as relationships. I knowing a surplus of female psyche because of growing up with a lot, that affected my life. This Changed me, knowing how they feel and what they think. But, when It comes to relationships, they cover it with some pheromonic stimulant to males brains which I can't surpass. Basically, I'm saying girls are weird! It is hard for me to like someone with so much emotion. A bond or connection consists of two interloping emotions. The games girls play! If you have a great feeling for someone let them know! Don't hide it, If there is something just say it! I also witnessed that if a friend of someone likes a person that likes their friend. That someone ignores them, it finally unrolled in my head. That's tough, just cause one of your friends likes someone, doesn't mean you dont get the right to have feelings for them. That's harsh, eh?
