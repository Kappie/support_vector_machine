She's an amazing cook so the food was absolutely smashing. She actually made marzipan from scratch by hand! Among the guests was the novelist  urlLink Vance Bourjaily , who told me the story of how he started out as a writer. He also recited the poem that he'd used to win his wife's heart. 
  
Although the party had ended by 1:30, we didn't get to bed until 3am. The next day was spent listening to Raynah regale us with stories of her colourful globetrotting life.
