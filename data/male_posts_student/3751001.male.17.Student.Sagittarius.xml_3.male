Today i'm going to talk about my freinds, or rather lack of them.  A "freind" holds much significance for me just like finding a partner. Freinds are people I trust more then my own family, a freind to me is someone i look up to and listen to. My freinds are fascinating people, many are unhappy and troubled much like myself and this makes me feel more like a normal person and not "Mr Unlucky", to me this binds us together.  As a Introvert i have found it very difficult to reveal my inner thoughts, i could blame this for my failings in School. I've seen the death of a member of my family which was sudden and shocking, the death occurred in the october holiday of 2000 and i was back at school on the first day back.  I managed to tell one person of this death, they did not know how to respond, they thought i was joking. Over the next few weeks people began to find out, unable to cry i unleashed my pain in the form of anger - one of my great flaws.  Today i only see anger as a way of relieving the pain of something, i hate it but i've accepted it as part of me and hopefully my freinds who are normally at the recieving end of it do also. My life has not been brilliant, much of it remains a secret and will do for the rest of my days on Earth.  I really hate secrets, there a nasty thing to contain and for some reason people share theirs with me but i cannot with them. I've revealed secrets but these secrets have been used against me by who i considered "freinds". If your reading this i do hope you can forgive yourself.  I will never share anyone elses secrets, i'm a person who values trust and i should set an example if others dont. I'm a quiet guy most of the time, i enjoy my own company but i do enjoy going out with freinds places, if only they came out more often...  Anyways, enough of this depressing rant. I've got two years of further education ahead of me, i'm going to meet new freinds at college who hopefully i will value more then previous ones. This year has been quite a troubling one for me as i've noticed i have not many freinds, i've learnt more about myself but i need to do more. I need to save myself from myself.  ~Atrocity
