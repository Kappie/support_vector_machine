Ah, the fun never stops. Ah, yes the dirt bikes. We were on a farm in Pennsylvania (my step-uncle's) and he taught me to ride his Honda racing bike that was modified for dirt bike-ness. It was a blast! 5 speeds on an open field. Nothing like it. Now I know why Katy loves those things so much. Huh. Adrenaline pump. I raced with my little brother and cousin. It was fun. Only one crash, but I'm fine; locked the brakes and the bike slid out from under me. I got pretty muddy, and the shifter on the bike got bent, but that was easily fixable.  We also went site-seeing in Philadelphia (and I did go to a kosher from Jerusalem deli)(and they did have pastrami)(and tongue)(maybe). It was cool, but I am ashamed that I bought things on buy-nothing day. Well, at least most of it went to the natioanl park service; thats a good cause. Well, I'm not too ashamed. I didn't go 'shopping'.  Anyway, on the flight home tonite, me and my brother got free upgrades to first class (long story). When they brought around a tray of assorted goodies, me and my brother helped ourselves to a generous amount of Milano cookies (hey, they're free and we're freeloaders). By generous I mean about 6 or 7 packages. Anyway, the flight attendant gave us both dirty looks and scowled at us the whole rest of the flight. Hm, strange considering the cookies are FREE!!! THERE ARE NO FREAKING RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT YOU CAN TAKE! ARGH! Does that make us bad people?  Hmmm..also, did lots of thinking on this trip. There are two types of people in this world; those who can take what others tell them on faith, and those who have to have first hand experience. This can apply to many different circumstances. For example, if someone tells me that fire hurts and explains logically why t hurts, and I feel a basic instinct that that is true, then I will believe them and not touch fire. However, there are those that will, despite warnings, put they're hands in the fire and get burned, just to see if it really happened. This could apply to anything from religion to sticking your finger in an electrical socket. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs? Why? Because people have told me what they can do to you, and deep down I know they are bad, so no matter how much I am tempted to do so (and thats a lot), I don't. I don't need to try it to know its bad. But some people might. I'm not saying either way is wrong, in fact to have a balance of both is the best way to go, but in some situations I personally believe there are situations where one way could lead to something bad.  When asked why people need religion, I thought about it. I realized that people need religion to answer three basic questions that come up in everyone's life: 1)Where did I come from. 2)Why am I here? 3)Where will I go when I die?  All religions, even aitheism, answer these three questions. Every single one. And everyone eventually encounters these three questions in there life, no matter how long they put them off. In fact, this is why so many people find religion when a love one dies. They wonder where they went and whether they will see that person again. It's perfectly natural.  Oh gosh. Lots of thinking feels good.  Alright, goodnite ladies and gents.
