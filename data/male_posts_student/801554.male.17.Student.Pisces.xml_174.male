Bought an awesome cd today, The Postal Service's Give Up. I really really really really like the second track. If you know this song, hopefully you know what I'm talking about. It's super awesome not to sound too idiotic.   My best freind is out of town this week and so I'm a bit bored and sadin case you were wondering how I was feeling. If not go screw yourself.   current music: supersonic, closing time. rather than the cd I just bought for some reason. Time for you to go out to the places you would be from.
