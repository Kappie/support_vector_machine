I quickly talked my mother into it, grabbed a shower, and got up there.  Some simple work doesn't seem like a lot to ask for some good food now does it? Well, little did I know, the work wouldn't be that simple.  It wasn't excrutiating, but it wasn't easy either.  We, that is, Donny, Ben, Donny's mother and father, and myself, worked for four hours doing miscellaneous things to make Donny's father's truck look and work better.  Quite a task.  Sadly, Ben didn't get to go eat with us, but I'm sure he'll be re-paid somehow.  But anyway, this brings me to my point.  Over the past years, my respect has been building for those who devote themselves to the labour that their career or life requires.  They work long and hard for little but self-gratification.  It seems pretty neat to me.  I mean, I share this feeling.  When I do something, say, like re-design  urlLink my blog  (which I actually did!), I sit back and look at it with pride.  Working is good for the soul.  It builds up self-esteem, character, what have you.  So the next time you get off your ass and do something, pat yourself on the back, will ya?
