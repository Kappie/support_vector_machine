Lord, please save me.. haha.. today's paper is science.. i'm confident that i'll pass but not too well though.. then lessons.. argh.. what is wrong with them?! they are so supposed to let us go home instead of keepin us back in sch.. aniwaeeee, today's chinese lesson is so  >..prob it's bcos of Mrs Er at the back of the class observin how we *learn*.. that's why she didn't let us copy the whatever millions and millions of words that we usually do for her classes.. we don't even understand what we are copyin but we jus copy for the sake of copyin.. LoL.. that's why my chinese is so bad... then Gurgit's class.. last 2 periods.. as usual, she's a PAIN IN THE ASS.. or rather, PAIN IN -MY- ASS.. LoL.. i think that Xiang Yun went too far today.. it's like she's bein defiant to her mother... her attitude i mean.. weird.. i dun know why but i think she likes Sebastian..  I hope to see him again tmr.. hehe.. and by the way, if u are readin this Shehana, thanx for ur graffitti.. it's really cool.. sH signin off.. peace ppl.. V
