Despite this, I look forward to having long hair again after the show. I'll have to put it in corn rows more often. Also, before shaving it all, I only had half a head of hair. I will have pictures of both alternative hairstyles. Okay, there was a lot more to this post, but blogger's being stupid and I lost most of it.  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
