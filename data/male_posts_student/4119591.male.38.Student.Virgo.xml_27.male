Barris is probably best know in popular culture as the host of  The Gong Show .  I remember watching  The Gong Show  in the seventies (back when there were few channels and even fewer choices). At the time, watching the Barris' show was arguably better than, say, watching paint dry on a new wall. I can even vaguely remember the controversy surrounding specific things presented on the show and more generally the broad strokes with which critics painted the program. It was thought at the time that such programming lowered standards of broadcasts (a relative notion if there ever was one) and caused our national IQ to drop.  Fast forward to about 1998 and remember that similar criticism has been leveled at the likes of  Beavis and Butt-head  and, more recently, at the popular spate of reality shows. Just how dumb can TV get? I don't think we've reached the bottom nor do I think it honestly matters.  If TV is dumb,  Confessions  is a smartly (and darkly) produced film (directed by George Clooney) about the master of all that dumbness. To hear Berris tell it, he's more than just  Gong Show . He created the  Newlywed Game ! This, at least is verifiably true. However there are other aspects of Barris' life that were previously unknown -- and possibly downright untrue. False, perhaps. For instance, did you know that Happy Chuck worked for the CIA (indirectly) and participated in the assassination of as many as thirty-three people? No? I didn't know that and I don't think I know it now.  The trick to enjoying  Confessions  is in watching a life unfold in flashback and in allowing the author to have his way with the truth; watching through the lens of his point of view and imagination. You know that what you're watching is at least partially fictional, but it is intriguing all the same.  Sam Rockwell stars as Barris, Drew Barrymore plays his girlfriend, Penny.   Tania and I give it six popcorn kernels out of ten. Maybe extra (low-fat) butter for clever cinematography.
