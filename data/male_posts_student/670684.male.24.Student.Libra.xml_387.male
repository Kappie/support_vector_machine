He gave me good comments, but at the time they were tough to hear.  And he knows what I said.    You forget that some things should remain private.  It's funny...writing is about taking risks, putting things on the page that might not be appropriate, going for it in a situation.  And it's a training mechanism to do that...no one can immediatley turn on a switch of HONESTY that distances themselves from the passive/agressive, socially conscious individual who says nice things and thinks otherwise.  You train your mind, and you must train your writing in the same way.  But how do you go back and write the honesty, and put yourself on the page.    I do it a bit flippantly; I'm a fan of the southern Alabama style of jokes, crass and crude, that are nothing more than distractions to fill up where I should honesty let it out.  It's a start, but it's still far from it.  There's too much fear in putting the honest you on the page.  What if it's not liked?
