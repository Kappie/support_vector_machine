My group is the laziest mother fuckers who rahter play Power Rangers or talk about some Anime stuff. i asked Howard of what he thought of my friend.LoL, omg in my history class! I was talking to my classmate Mike, and I was doing a hand gesture pointing at my stomach. This guy name Marvin sitting behind me asked if I was pregnant. Sarcastically, I said: "Ya It's your child, I want my child support" Mike started laughing and turning red, so did Howard. We went on joking bout that for the next 10 mins and then Marvin wrote on the bored: "It's Not Mine". I ended up saying:"Ya it is i got the blood test back." and Howard said: "That's what they all say." Funny Shiet.You had to be there to laugh at it. Looking at my clock, its 8:22 P.M. I'm planning to call my friend a.k.a my significant other. I don't know if i should. I told him to call me later tonight. I wonder what impression it gives off if i call him... My cousin told me a few days ago, that if me and him are suppose to happen, then it will happen and this is just one of those times in a relationship. Plus, i guess we rushed a little bit into it. I was so hungry to be with someone that i lost track of what he thought. He has to establish himself as a person and citizen and I have to establish myself also. But i wouldn't mind establising with him here.  It's all good though. Maybe that saying is true, Seperation makes the heart grow fonder.   "I know you had to go away I died just a little, and I feel it now You’re the one I need I believe that I would cry just a little Just to have you back now Here with me"    "And I’m asking And I’m wanting you to come back to me Please?"
