My alarm sounds, followed by me hitting the snooze three times. 7:15 I wake up and get showered. After jumping in my car and pulling out of my driveway, I begin my morning prayer. Just as I get ready to turn onto eldridge, I remember I forgot my social security card. I U-Turn and pick that up with very little time to spare. God Answers all prayers.  I make it to Nesbits in ample time and begin work for that day. Nothing particulalry interesting happened that day at work. Outside of having a short, mexican lady come and tell me why I'm stupid. I hate people who never graduated high school tell me I'm stupid. There's just something wrong with that. Nesbits is not to bad. I can actually go to the restroom or sit down every so often, much unlike Rib-Tickler once was. I rue the days I worked there! After six hours of work, I make my way home and begin preperation for the bible study I would be leading in about 5 hours.   The 'preperation' that lasted from 2:15-4:45 was mostly me staring at my computer screen and then a bible. Followed by about an hour and a half of watching television. I print the bible study sheet out, jump in my car and drive towards Prince of Peace. Already there is Matt R. and his wife Stephanie with their baby girl of 3 months, Mary Clare Regitz. As I tend to do around kittens and cute babies, I stammered around and expelled some giberish. Smith showed up and we sat down to practice. Thankfully enough, I was able to neutralize a majority of the monopoly he originally had over our bible study (which was originally MY idea to begin with). I sat him down and told him how things were going to be. 'I do this, you do this. Got it? Good.' I made a few copies, and he wrote some 'burdens' down on popsicle sticks for the bible study. We go to church and say a quick prayer, then he starts practicing for Praise n' worship. I go and bug Matt for a little bit, followed by him kicking me out of his office and into the youth room to start PnW.   For praise n worship, I sat in the front corner and nodded my head to the music. I felt overly charismatic that night! As people begin entering the room, my head looks for her. The one person I actually wanted to see that night, the one who I wanted to see me. A while ago, I promised myself that I would finally confess that I have feelings for her the next time I saw her. After thirty minutes and her not being there, I came to the obvious truth that she wouldn't be there. Praise n Worship ends, and bible study begins. I tell a crappy joke, and then introduce our topic for tonight. 'What burdens us from God'? The bible study started off rather smoothly, but eventually picked up after Smith and I got the hang of it. Just as we finished our discussion on the first verse, she entered the room. Smelly, unkempt, wearing a dirtyPoP t-shirt and nasty shorts. Beautiful. It took me about five seconds to draw my attention back to the bible study. I was enthralled.   Smith begins his popsicle stick plan... Disaster. The thing was a debachery and poorly executed. I looked to Matt and told him I wish we had thought about splitting into groups beforehand. Oh well, it wasn't a complete failure.I felt like going around to see how the small groups were interacting. Yeah, I basically went to see her and that was it. Was it very obvious? Probably.   Finally, we had the people there write down their burdens, and put them on nails in a big cross we have. It was hilarious though, having people come up there and have trouble putting their paper on the nails. Half of them ripped. We ended quietly with Dave playin some music. I'd say the whole event was a success. Matt wanted to know if we'd ever do it again. I said if he ever wanted us to.   I went to go talk to her as soon as I could.I needed to talk to her, to hug her, to be with her. We stayed and talked for a good 5-10 minutes. Many a time did she mention her boyfriend though. Not necissarily what I wanted to hear, but at least it was her who was speaking. I enjoyed the evening well enough.   I gave her a hug goodbye and she was gone. Didn't tell her I had feelings for her. Just said i 'might' have sent heran email. Didn't tell her it was an email I made just for her so I could send her one email.   Stephanie had left with Mary Clare earlier so Matt was without a car. He asked me if I could take him home, and seeing as how he did the day before we started bombing Iraq, I was more than happy too. Plus he lived about 2 minutes from my house. So we drove, and we chatted the whole way there. It's great talking to him. We talked about CtR's inferior bible study, our bible study, retreats and what not. He said he wanted to continue that conversation with me over coffee some time. I'll be meeting him tomorow 2:30 at common grounds coffee house. I hate coffee.   Well, I'm in lakewood park, and lost. Who do I know who lives there? None other than THE shannon lam. So i called her, she rescues me from my being lost, and we conversate for a while. I was pissed we didnt hang out last week, but oh well. She said she'd get her sister's-boyfriend to pirate me anime, so I'm happy. She went back to her house to pack, I went home to get online.   She was online. First time I've ever seen her online. She was checking email or something. We spoke for a while and it was awesome. She signed off, and I went to bed. My day was over at 11:30...    See you space cowboy...
