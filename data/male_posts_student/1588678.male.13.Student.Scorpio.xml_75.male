For example: One month I'll listen to nothing but Radiohead, two months I'll listen to nothing but Bob Dylan, ect. Anyways, lately I've been listening to Nirvana like nuts! Every since Kurt Cobain's 10 Anniversary I've listened to them so friggin' much! Like, the other day, I listened to In Utero at least 4 times straight! Holy shit! Even as I write this post, I'M LISTENING TO NIRVANA!!! My god, is this some sign. Is it a sign from the grave of Cobain? Is my life gonna end? Will Ben Affleck and JLo EVER do a good movie? I better go and, uh, listen to Nirvana??? Hehe!  Tomorrow, I'll be sure to have a post about this weeks Viva La Bam episode   urlLink here  . Be sure and check it out. Later.
