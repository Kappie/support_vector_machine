Just get yourself torture again n hurt once more.  ----Things may not happen because they owe you. Maybe its just natural cycle.  ----The pain of loving someone had numbed the fortune of being loved.  ----The art of loving is not to take, not sacrfice but to let go.  ----Put yourself in my shoe, how much you love him means how much i love u.  ----The scent, resemblance and music... From time to time maybe someday to the brink of time.. They always exist there.  ----Can dwelling over poignant memories be enjoyable? It tells us about what had happened. To remain unhappy always, you will realise many simple happiness present around us.  ----To try dating with someone before getting into a relationship is said to be mature  understanding of the other. But at the point that both are deeply in love, do you thin they will still date before they get together? Dating is juz to nurture the feelings between each other. If thats the case, what for try to love each other when there is no love yet? COnsiderating the fact that love is a special feeling, please prolong its existance before it fade away.
