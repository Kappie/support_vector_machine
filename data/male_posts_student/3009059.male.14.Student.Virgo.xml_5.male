On the 21st of May, R.Kelly visited Non-south Capital of Indonesia International School, to sing "I Believe I can Fly" for the special end of year NJIS dance.  Darius Teng who was acting very much like a  Gallus domesticus , rushed outside of the dancing room, and started running away.  In his own mind, he probably was thinking of dancing with Sir Townley's well developed embryo.  Teng, was forced to dance by his cool best friend, Hans Lesmana, but he refused.  Dimas Hendarto, his other non-social climber friend, was sitting at his house playing his black box.  This has nothing to do with the fact of Sir Townley disliking Darius Teng.  As I was saying, Darius was pulling his sweaty hands of the strong grips of Hans Lesmana.  Lesmana asked for reinforcements from his very influencing friend, Taslim.  Taslim asked Sir Townley's well developed embryo to come with her, and dance with Teng.  Teng still refuses, a funny creature that he is.  Teng finally followed his logics, having the greatest 2 minutes of his life.  And dat's why Sir T hates TEngu
