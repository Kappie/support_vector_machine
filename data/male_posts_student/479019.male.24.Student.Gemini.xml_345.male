I wonder if I should go. I think it might be fun. I've never been hit by a rubber bullet before. Then again with the current weather... travel might not be so much fun, nor would standing out in the cold.  I wonder if I'll have my Netflix movies today?  I'm still listening to  the (International) Noise Conspiracy .  ***
