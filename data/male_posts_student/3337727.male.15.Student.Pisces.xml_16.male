I don't know if it's just normal teenage Linkin Park-esque angst, but I really do think I'm ugly. Nat and Mike's lil threeway about the subject didn't help much either. If I actually was good looking as they claim, girls wouldn't run away from me, laugh in my face, or flirt with me all school year out of sympathy.   Okay...I REALLY miss Ali...I have only been able to talk to her for a few minutes over the last two days..and I miss her so much. Of course I'm worried about her too...what with her illness and what happened to her a few nights ago. And I'm across the country, unable to be by her side. -_-  Thirdly, I must begin Summer school in a month or two. *major collective groan* And I must do Algebra..and if I don't pass it, I must repeat the ninth grade. >_> Not how I wish to spend Summer. Not only that, if Ali can indeed make it over here this Summer, I have no way of meeting up with her without telling my parents about her. ...they don't even like me talking to people on MSN or AIM, let alone meeting girls I met online who I might possibly have sex with. They'll kill me. X_X
