Went to Marin County Fair after pool party, saw some cool art, paid $11 to walk around with a ton of people. Lines long for carnival rides. Had the best $4 beer ever. Mild sunburn. Saw the coolest 5 minute firework show ever.  3. Saturday, finished my parakeet cage; worked at rescue center from 2-8:30pm.   4. Sunday, went out to Point Reyes and hiked the Bolinas Ridge trail about 2.5 miles deep then turned back because I was not prepared for the amount of sun. Second sunburn of the weekend. Wife and dog also hiked with me. Saw a few ravens, lots of turkey vultures, a wren, and a redtail hawk. Lots of cows, my pup even tryed to attack one - it started to charge and we all had a little freak out! Went home and cooked up some awesome shirmp fajitas on the grill and watched Independence Day on TV.  5. Today I work at rescue center for the first half of the day. Had the pleasure of working with a GOLDEN EAGLE and that was amazing. Very massive bird, alot more that I had expected. Poor guy is missing his right eye also he is still just a baby but adult size. wow. Had lady tell me at the book store that I should but all my efforts towards becoming a millionare. What a disappoint life I would lead if that was my ultimate goal.  g'night   current mood:  okay current music: BANE
