The $263.1 million prize will be split between the Walkenbachs in Missouri and someone else in Pennsylvania.  An Associated Press  urlLink story  had this to say:  William Walkenbach, a production supervisor, said he wants to "finally get me a tractor with brakes." He will never be able to sell his old tractor now. Everyone in the world knows that the brakes don't work. Sheesh!
