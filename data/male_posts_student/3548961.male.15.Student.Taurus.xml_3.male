Well, im not bidding on any cleats, im not watching any games besides the ones i talked about last night, theres just not much to talk about in the soccer world, this is a first for me. uh, i get to play tomorow with brb also known as brian robert bouhl. so uh, yey for me. theres just not much to say other than the things that have been said, wow. nothing really new. maybe im just boring right now i don't know, i usualy have more to say. sorry for you who read this but i don't know what to say, maybe you should make something cool happen so i can write about...maybe. sorry and ofcourse love always -alex
