In fact, I look at my dog, who is struck my an unnatural and quite frankly self-destructive fear of rain/thunder/loud-noises-that-sound-like-thunder, and I think, "Hey, I used to be like that.  Ha!  Neurotic little kid."  I love thunderstorms now; the worse the better.  Now, I'm not asking for a full-fledged tornadic outbreak, but a lightning storm can be incredible to watch and, with the help of its accompanying sister Thunder, listen to.  Tonight was a big disappointment, though.  All boom and no substance behind it.  Sigh.  Maybe tomorrow.  Playing the piano is fun, too.  I can almost play through the book  Evening Reflections , which, if you'll remember, I bought around mid-May with the gift certificate I got from the conducting contest.  It really is a great book to play through: the music is soft, quiet, and simple.  Funny thing is, my mom looked at the book and said, "That looks too simple."  Yes, Mom, it is simple.  But simple doesn't necessarily equal bad in terms of (save me!  I just said "in terms of"!!!) music.  In fact, simple can sometimes be better than complex when you're talking about emotion.  But that's complex music stuff, so I won't get into that.   Rain, rain, don't go away. Come again and we can play.
