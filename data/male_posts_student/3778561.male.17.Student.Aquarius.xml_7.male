I had another meeting today that was cancelled I fell off of my bike and hurt my knee, I also triped and fell down when I came in the house this morning. Yeup I am defenently accident proned. I just got back from Stephenville yesterday and I see Harmon Feild Day and I brought back some Bawls (http://www.bawls.com) I also made a quick stop into Corner Brook to see all of the Tri-Fest activities really busy there. The Strawberry Festival is comeing up also which will be a bundle of fun I am on the Committee to help plan it. Also I am still waiting for my movie to come in down at CD Plus they said 2 - 3 weeks you would have to wait for the movie to come in, but now I am in my forth week of waiting and there is still no sign of my movie. I called down today and they said it was not in and they said that they would call me when it came in. Ahhhhh well t hems the breaks I suppose well thats I that I have to say for this entry. Until the next post!
