So yeah, once again, I'll write about Simple Plan since it's been on my mind for more than a long time... I really like SP because all of their music is real, it all comes from the heart. The music can do whatever you want it to, it can give you a sense of hope or sadness, it's all up to you they just put the words and the music out there in a great way and you take it all in, sort of like a sponge. Then in your head you decide if you like it or not and if you do it will invoke a great feeling in your head, with SP feelings get invoked that I could've never even imagined until I heard their songs, particulary "Perfect" and "Crash and Burn". Their music amazes me and helps me to figure things out if I'm confused or upset about something, it always helps me to be who I am and never forget that who I am is who I am no matter what someone may say to me, I'm not going to change. Another reason I like SP is because they are really nice to their fans, particulary Chuck, they didn't let it get to their heads, they haven't forgotte who they are and what they were like before they were famous. Chuck amazed me at what he did for Krissy, it takes a dedicated artist to go up to a fan that's in emotional trouble and make them feel better, I mean some artrists ignore their fans and think they are above them. I think Chuck has to be the most amazing person I know right now, he took the time to comfort someone who he didn't even really know and didn't ask for anything in return. It's great how people do that, they would help someone they didn't know if they needed it, those kind of people make the world a great place to be. Lastly, SP members are really hot but that doesn't really matter :p! I was talking to Melissa today about finding a boyfriend and taking him to prom this year if I had one. I kept saying it was so lonley without someone to call "the one". I used to know what it felt like, well maybe it was a false sense of love but I felt that I really loved him a lot. I can remember wanting to talk to him all the time in Mrs. Welke's class, but yeah I don't feel like talking about that right now, it still hurts sometimes.... Well I don't really know what else to say, I'm off to the Family Reunion this weekend which is really fun so I've been kinda busy with getting things ready for that...
