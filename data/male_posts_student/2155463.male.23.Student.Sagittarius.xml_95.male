For anyone reading this, you have to understand that this was a momentous occassion for me - I used to be a VERY competitive swimmer (near nationals-level), but then I dropped out of swimming midway through high school b/c CVCA didn't have a team.  And I haven't gotten back into the water to do any competitive swimming since then, so it was so weird to actually get back in and give it a try.  But it was amazing how quickly things came back to me - I guess it's kind of like riding a bike, you never really forget how.  Of course, I only got in about a 1,000 yards in a half-hour, my knee is all swelled up because I'm not used to doing breaststroke kick, I couldn't swim more than 100 yards at a time (but in fairness, I had lifted and biked 6 miles before I got in), and I could only swim a 50 in 40 seconds, so it was a far cry from what I used to be able to do.   But at the same time, it was great to just get back in and I'm sure I can get things back to being somewhat respectable (I even went out and ordered two pairs of Swedes today :)
