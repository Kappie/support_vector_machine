Sarah needed to get some clothes for her senior pictures and I needed some clothes for school, so we went to the Mall. We shopped for about four or five hours, and then we drove home. After that, we watched "Starsky  Hutch" and "13 Going on 30." It was good times. I woke up at my usual time today (11-11:30 am), and promptly got on the computer. We were supposed to go to the Lit concert at the Mid State Fair, but there's been a change of plans. Sarah was over about an hour ago...she brought me ice cream. I love her. Alrighty. Goodbye.
