Today has been a really crummy day, overall, but Derek Lowe pitched 8 2-hit innings, and lowered his ERA to 1.90, and raised his record to 7-1 and the Sox dropped the White Sox 9-0, so that took some of the edge off.  I'm not really sure what to make of all the things that went on today, but I think I'm okay with pretty much everything, with the exception of the last little bit.  I can let a lot of things slide... I do on a regular basis.  I can deal with people talking about me, casting aspersions, being petty and whatnot, but I won't tolerate people lying to me... especially people I trust.  No one should stand for that sort of thing.  And though it hurts and part of me would rather just forget it happened, I think I'd be doing myself an injustice if I just forgave this person.  It was a very deliberate lie that carried on for a year, and even now, she's denying it... but the honest to goodness truth has been corroborated by several people who know this person, and there can be no denying it.  SO... I'm just very... let down.  I trust people too easily.  I let people in too easily.  And now I see why everyone told me to be careful.  I'm planning my road trips for the coming year.  Two 2-week trips, if all goes well.  The first one to Cape Breton, London, Amsterdam, and Prague.  The second, to Moscow, Geneva, Athens, and Istanbul.  Hopefully the first will be in mid-September, and the second in... probably early April.  Right after HS Tour.  That will be amazing.    I'm going to go for now.  Don't be surprised if I write again... i'm trying to get back in the habit, and the best way to do that is to go nuts with it at first, then ease off.  At least for me.  I dunno.  Til next time.  May the Road...
