I am happy to say that on this day, gay marriages became legal in our country (if only in Massachusetts) for the first time.  I wish to share a portion of an article from the New York Times (Thanks to my man Jason who sent it to me!).  Andrew Sullivan wrote:   WASHINGTON - Today is the day that gay citizens in this country cross a milestone of equality. Gay couples will be married in Massachusetts - their love and commitment and responsibility fully cherished for the first time by the society they belong to. It is also, amazingly enough, the day of the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruling that ended racial segregation in schools across America. We should be wary of facile comparisons. The long march of African-Americans to civil equality was and is deeply different from the experience and legacy of gay Americans. But in one respect, the date is fitting, for both Brown and this new day revolve around a single, simple and yet deeply elusive idea: integration.    It is, first, a human integration. Marriage, after all, is perhaps the chief mechanism for integrating new families into old ones. The ceremony is a unifying ritual, one in which peers and grandparents meet, best friends and distant relatives chatter. It's hard for heterosexuals to imagine being denied this moment. It is, after all, regarded in our civil religion as the "happiest day of your life." And that is why the denial of such a moment to gay family members is so jarring and cruel. It rends people from their own families; it builds an invisible but unscalable wall between them and the people they love and need. (For the full article,  urlLink click here )   I find that this day is the most appropriate day one could have ever envisioned for such a monumental breakthrough as this is.  I am deeply touched personally, as this marks one more step in the advancement of rights for Jason and I.  Also, if you are interested in why marriage is so important to gays and lesbians, visit the Human Rights Campaign's  urlLink Marriage website .  They have some helpful information.  I have also written about this topic on  urlLink 2nd-Storey Window's  marriage discussion under the title "The Ousted One."    The Human Rights Campaign, a non-profit group supporting the rights of gays and lesbians, has a petition seeking a  urlLink "Million for Marriage."   If you have not signed that petition and support the rights of gay and lesbian people like myself and my partner, please click the link and sign that now!  THANKS!  Finally, on a personal note...I received an acceptance letter to Vanderbilt Divinity School today, and I will find out about a scholarship award from them in the next few days.  Keep praying!  I'll report more when I find out!  Lastly, I am almost ready to begin writing my life story, tracing the significant events that have led me to my current theological conclusions concerning sexuality.  Sorry for the delay...working 40 hours a week sucks!  Get me back in school!! :)
