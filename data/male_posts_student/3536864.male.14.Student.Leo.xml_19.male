Then there are my other moves, that really stank.  Thus underdog.  I'll get it though.  Only lost three out of eight games. Wasn't to bad. I played for 3 hours! On that note, it wasn't bad at all. Today my family and I went to mazzio's to eat pizza (oh, who 'da thought?) and cake.  We had to get our own cake, but we were going to have to get a regular sized cake for $17. But a guy from our church (who was also getting a cake for his dad's birthday) found the same kind of cake, and we could get two for $14.  Nice deal.  So we got that,(ryan and I) and we got frappachinos with the leftover money :-) On to mazzio's we went!  There we watched tennis, and european football...and made fun of french and german people.  I also had a trick played on me which is to close for me to talk about right now (it cut me deep ;-) ) and i messed up someone's fun by making the language portugeuse...yah.. Anyways... I went to a different church with my family this morning, it was a good sermon, and the people are very nice.  The old people anyway, the youth, i think, are all mute.  Time, once again, is not on my side so i'll leave you with this....Zzzzzz
