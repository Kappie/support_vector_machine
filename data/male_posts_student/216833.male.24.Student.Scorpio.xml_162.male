The entire day proved one thing. People are lame. Over here, you have the guy who trys to hard. Over there, here comes some super fat couple to bitch and yammer to me about shit I don't care about. I've found my self physically cringing at the sounding kick off of another useless anecdote.  What the fuck is wrong with me? This retail shit has really made me see through some people for who they really are. I used to be nicer, at least I thought so. Fuck being nice, it's a waste of time. Just cut the fuckers off fast and kill the pain before it begins.  Hyper people, calm the fuck down! There is no reason to run back and forth like a caged dog. You'll find yourself a weak, decrepit old bag of dust. This shit pisses me off.  Don't get me wrong from my journal entries. I'm not always pissed. Just most of the time. I brought over Happiness to watch at Brenden's house. They had already started XXX. Good old Vin Disel skating around on his enormous, testosterone fuel cock rocket. Saving people with one fail swoop of his manhood...what a load of hollywood manure.  I think I might go to Lodi today, but I'm not sure when jeremy is supposed to get back from the mountains. sigh....   current mood:  discontent current music: Willie Nelson - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
