He approaches it from a psycho-sociological perspective, and his conclusions gel very well with statements I've made in the past. Humans are simply not rational beings. Oh, we can talk about logic and reasoning and even the scientific method - but in reality we all process every scrap of information and sensory input through our brain, and our brain is shaped and defined by our experiences. There is really no such thing as an absolutely correct solution to any problem (especially in politics). The main problem behind partisanship and subsequent polarization is the lack of ability to see a problem beyond the confines of personal interpretation.   Brooks has it right - politics is very much like religion. You form opinions in religion based on a set of beliefs. Politics is no different. And just as certain religions cannot get along despite seemingly similar goals, so it is with politics.
