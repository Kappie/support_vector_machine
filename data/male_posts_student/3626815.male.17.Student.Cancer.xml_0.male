Anyway, I haven't had much to do, so I've been watching my Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD's a lot. (I don't care what you think Adam, the show is great, so it must be  you  who sucks.)  Been fooling around with my computer, playing some DDR, (Dammit Evan, someday you  will  try it!)  etc, etc.  Want to know a great way to spend a Saturday evening? Clubbing? Hanging out with friends? No, try going to the mall and grocery store with your mom. Really puts your social life in perspective.  That cashier at Strawbridge's would just  not...shut...up.   Heh, with Steve in NJ with his girlfriend, I have the computer all to myself, and yet I can't find anything to do with it except make a blog post.     Frylock: Yep, I thought it was about time that we invested in a high-definition plasma screen.    Meatwad: I thought you said TV was bad.  Frylock: It is. But we f***ing need it.
