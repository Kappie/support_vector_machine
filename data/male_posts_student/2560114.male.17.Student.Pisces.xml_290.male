He jus dominates the inside and jus runz over ppl. He brought the lakerz to 4 out of 5 nba championships, and winning 3 of them...now the lakerz got pot-head lamar odom, caron butler(hez alright), and brian grant(another old guy), and aswell as a 1st-round draft pick...which is like the 27th pick. I think that the lakerz should of got someone or some other ppl than the playerz from the heat...like maybe yao ming and some other guy that is tight...or 2 ppl that r tight...idk about the rocketz, all i know is they gotz yao ming and t-mac. Thats my input on the shaq trade...   On kobe's upcoming choice (lakers or clippers...hmmmm???)   Well if kobe goes to the clips...hez gonna play wit the crap of the crap...even though the clippers cleared space in their roster and promised kobe that they r gonna play a few games in anaheim, doesnt mean the clippers is a good choice...if kobe goes for the lakerz, he will b the leader on this team. I think that kobe is a great player, no doubt...but to b the greatest, in my opinion, if kobe made his teammates look good in the next few seasons, he will b the greatest player of all time man. But if he does go wit the clips, cheap ticketz, im down like a clown. But i think he should stay wit the lakerz.
