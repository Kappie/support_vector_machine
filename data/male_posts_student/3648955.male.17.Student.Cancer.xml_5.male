She first had to go to the bank, then her perscription and they finally finished all their crap at about 5 pm. Then we're looking around for a grill. I wanted to go to sears because they have tons of grills. She kept complaining that we dont need an expensive one for over $60 because its only gonna be one barbeque. And i kept yelling at her that i dont want some cheap ass grill. And im gonna have like 7-8 people over the the shit.  So anyway we get a cheap ass grill that cost like $13... Very lame. Its retarded. Anyway also i bought 3 hawaiian bamboo torches which ive always wanted. So ill be putting those in the back tomorrow.  Anyway the barbeques hopefully gonna be great. Im hoping it doesnt rain like it did today and i gotta spray outside for the stupid mosquitoes...
