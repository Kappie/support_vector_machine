I will miss some people so much that it will be unbearable, no more midnight skating trips, no more sugar highs, no more song writing. be sure of this, there is not a moment when i will not feel so lonely thinking of you all, i will miss you all that much.   the rain begins to fall inside and out, i feel cold, shattered. teach me to cope someone.  it has been so hard going a day without seeing sqeet, a week at a time will be hard. the knowledge of her bieng mine, and that alone, will let me survive. the sound of these very words makes me shudder, it is cheesy, it is cliched, but as i think about this cliche, i know how very true, how very sincere that it is. bye for now.
