Ah, well, lets see here stayed up all night last night studying for Econ. Econ sucks fat donkey dick! Hopefully, I'll pull a C out of my ass on that one. I went to all my classes today despite not having a wink of sleep....I was impressed with myself. Talked to the new woman, and I guess we're gonna "hang out" on Saturday. That'll be good. Anwyas I'm tired. Out.   -Sieckman
