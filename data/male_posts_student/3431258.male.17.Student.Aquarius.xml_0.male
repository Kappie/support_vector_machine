Experimented a new deck at school, but it needs tweaking, a lot in fact.  Wanderley  came to my house from 2hpm to 8hpm. We played halo with my brother for an hour, and i  introduced  Soldat  to him. Thinks he like it quite a lot, but not as much as  Battlefield 1942 . I admit myself being a Battlefield addict, it's so nice and realistic.   Also, played 1 hour of Soldat with  Julien . Played on 3 servers, then i decided to make my own, it was too slow on 2 of them, and the 3rd was filled with veterans. It was a lot of fun. Also speaked a bit about Halo II  with him. He said he will ship me the collector's edition for free! Thanks Julien!   Started to fantasm again on  LaRonde . My father suggested a season pass for the 3 weeks, i'm not against the idea, but it may be difficult to get  Frozen Throne  in the end.   Read some stuff on Belgium Beers.  Stela Artois , i want to try this one if i ever get the chance.  Regards,  Zephyr
