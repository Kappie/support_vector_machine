Not that I don't love my here, my now, but we all often find ourselves romanticizing distant lands and times past.  The beauty that is existance, that is the human brain, to carry one's self fantastically.  Is there ever a limit might be a good question, how many lose themselves never to return?  Where do obligations lie?  I think I'll take this yellow brick road a bit further, I hear the Shire is nice this time of year.
