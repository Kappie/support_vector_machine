Some people had told me that they didn't really like the ending, but I thought that it made perfect sense since several philosophical threads from different religions ran through the whole series, and the ending was simply the logical conclusion of the movies as a rational outcome of the philosophy that had been building.  Of course, that's probably more analytical analysis of the movie than any of you wanted to hear...  Of course, aside from this it has the typical awesome special effects and all...a couple of times Jay, Ed, and I kinda gave each other that " OH YEAH !" look in anticipation of a sweet fight or something.  And I have to say that I wan't really disappointed in that regard...the last one was a lot like the first two in terms of action, etc., but that's as much as I'm going to say because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't already seen it.  Speaking of movies...watched Finding Nemo with my Grandma and Jay for the third time in a week today.  I don't know what it is, but I absolutely love that movie...it's one of those movies where I can laugh at the same part over and over and over, even if I already know what the part is going to be and there isn't any surprise to anything.  Not to sound all parental, but it's just a good, down-to-earth, wholesome movie that really has a lot of laughs without being risque or anything, and I think that that's one of the primary reasons that it's kinda caught on with people of all ages (including my own oh-so-important demographic...).
