Super long weekend :) Oh, btw, I told wee abt my blog yesterday, so perhaps this blog now has a audience. Anyway, I just had a mega shouting match with my elder brother over some lame thing, I hesitate to say exactly wad. But its really lame lor. Today had chess training in lieu of going to the rugby match, so pro rite? Surprisingly enuff, many of the chess players tt could have gone for the traing instead opted to go root for the rugby match. I mean, Nat is understandable, after all he is a B div rugger, but even Bunny and wei cheng opted to go root for rugby! Still, more power to them I say. That's why we got holiday! I know I have alot of homework due really soon, but im not sure exactly wad. It's a scary feeling, i can tell u, being stuck without much apparent work on one hand, and waiting for the teachers to scream at u the next day. i noe I got the Chi test on Fri, perhaps I will go study tt later! Today got some lame fire drill, took out 1 period of Chi, but tts ok, I will just have to study it tonite or tommorrow. My IRS teacher didn't kill me u noe, actually said I did some work for once. I think my little bro noes (or thinks he does) abt Suz. I caught him trying to break my password by keying tt in...stupid family members, so irritating and over inquistive. I can't think of wad to do over the com now...I might go study soon. Bye! Ok, my bro juz apologised. Im not irritated anymore! :)
