Chi has yet to return, and I don't think there have been  any  group chats this week. At least none that I was a part of. My Stargate SG-1 season 1 and 2 DVD sets have been keeping me pretty busy.  urlLink Bofrearl  started existing.  urlLink Comics  stopped existing. And once again, no work this week since it was all rainy and such.This hasbeen  such  a rainy summer. Not the good rain, either. No thunderstorms or down pours. Just gray, misty, icky rain. Anyways, that's about it. I'll probably go continue working on comics. I'd like to get at least three done today. We'll see what happens though.
