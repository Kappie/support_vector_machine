A bit busy at the moment, but expect a nice long paranoid article later today, or perhaps early tomorrow depending on when I go to bed. Also, while you wait for updates here, you can always go and have a look at  urlLink Warren Ellis' Blog  - this is the research resource and sort of weblog for the bloke who wrote Transmetropoltan and The Authority. There's generally something interestingly bizzarre over there. Sorry about the lack of content, Withiel.
