My mom woke me up this morning around 6:30 and I was sleeping in the hallway. Not sure how that one happend. Then I kept waking up every other hour and I was asleep in the computer room floor. Now here I am awake. I went downstairs and there was a message of me talking to the doctors, lol, I dont remember that. Well I will update later.
