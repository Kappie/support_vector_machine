The good news is I got here so friggin early that no one was here. And believe me, I needed that. I just had to fill up my car with gas. $23.08. That was rough. Anyway.        I'm trying so hard to come up with something to say, but its not happening. That means its time for me to stop writing. I'll be back tomorrow.
