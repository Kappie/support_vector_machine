I mean I think that I did get through to most people. Yet the people who needed it really didn't get the message. And some of my friends kind of made a joke out of the verse, and I got mad and scolded them for doing such to GOD'S WORD.  I didn't get to go to youth group last night and I really wish that I had. But you know I really dislike my youth group. I mean some people come to associate and others come to hear from GOD, but the people who are there for the wrong reasons kind of mess it up for others. And you know my friend (who goes to the church that I pulled out from) told me that her youth group is really on fire now. And I really want, you know, to expirience the Fire again and be in fellowship with other on fire Christians but I really want to stay with my youth group that i'm with now.  I don't know what to do other than pray for the people that come. And I know that God will hear my prayers, but I just hope that something happens soon.  Ok so I'll post later. I gotta run!!
