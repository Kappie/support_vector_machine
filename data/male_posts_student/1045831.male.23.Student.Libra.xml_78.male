Her friend Kathryn Murphy came over and this girl is funny, not as funny as me but funny.  ;-)  Well we all go out to eat at Uncle Julio's for some good Mexican food.  Me and Kathryn start drinking by getting their signature drink, "The Twist."  It definitely had some booze in it though, that is where Kristen dropped the Bomb, Her man from the night before was  31 .  Yeah I couldn't believe it either, Old Balls.  But whatever after that we went and they took us to one of the greatest things I have ever heard of.  A drive through Daquari stand.  You can drive up to this place, order a daquari, in one of 32 different flavors, add extra shots of liquor if you want.  A great concept and a great start to the day.  After that it was fairly uneventful afternoon, watched "The Cutting Edge" and slept. For dinner we went to some little Italian place that was ok but the great thing about this place is that it is BYOB.  We were drinking Franzia from a box sitting on the table and it was great.  A lively conversation about sex was had by all and then it was off to see Willie Nelson.  Now I love Willie.  He is my Hero and I will do anything for the man but this concert was awful.  Absolutely nothing to do with Willie but the Venue was terrible.  Little girls yelling like it was an En'sync show.  Just awful full of people who didn't care about the concert.  I was pissed and left after 30 min. Then went back to the bar to hang with Kristen and Kathryn.  But it seems that while we were at the concert Kristen saw the 31 year old out with some other girl.  Then she got put on a Rugby players shoulders and had the entire bar yelling at her to show them her tits.  She of course didn't but during that time she had some bitch throw ice at her and yell shit at her.  This pissed her off so when she got of the Rugby players shoulders she went and bought a drink and then proceeded to throw it on her.  This led to her getting molested by one of her large, African friends.  So by the time we met up with them they were not in a good mood to say the least. But we still went to the bar and had a pretty good time..  Kristen got fall down drunk. Which was fun.  Then we went home at cheeseballs and it was off to bed.  Then in the morning we woke up tried to watch the chiefs which we didn't get in Dallas so we left.  I'm sure there were more things that happened.  Details that I left out but that is the gist of it and I'm tired..  I will throw in the advice I gave Paul on Friday night as an appendix.  And maybe a few other thoughts on the weekend.  But for now I'm out.. Peace.
