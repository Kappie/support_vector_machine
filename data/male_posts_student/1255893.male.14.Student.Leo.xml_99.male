Whatever happened to being friends huh? Just cus I made a few remarks about you're blog and how stupidly cynical it was (this was only 1 post by the way, the others were ok to me) doesn;t mean you have to overreact and stop thinkin of me as a friend. At least Cathy took it ok. She still thinks of me as a friend (i hope) Honestly, what the fuck did i do that talkin to me about it wouldn't have helped? so if you make new friends and you talk about them am i gonna stop talkin to you? well, too late for that. Cus I'm not gonna give a shit how many friends you have that arent me. cus im just not that fucking insecure.
