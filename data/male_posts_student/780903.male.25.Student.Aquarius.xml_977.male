Years from now, when he's the Aaron Spelling of his generation, you'll be able to say you saw the  very first episode  of television that Bob Smiley had on the air.  He's going places.  Seriously, he's an awesome, awesome writer, and it's super-cool that he's got something on TV.  I have no doubt tonight's episode will restore your faith in the half-hour sitcom format.  Okay, that probably puts too much pressure on it.  But, really, check it out.  I wouldn't miss it.  I'm serious about the Aaron Spelling thing.  I'd put money on it.     CBS, 8:00  (eastern).  If any of your friends have a Nielsen Box, tell them too.
