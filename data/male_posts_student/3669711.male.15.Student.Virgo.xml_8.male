Ahh yes, the carefree days, nothing to worry about, no one to worry about, just fun.  Some of the kids in my class brought laptops to school (before i got mine) and what they would do with them in class is play some CS.  It was free on  urlLink Steam , as a beta back then.  But unfortunately, i still had 56k then, so not only couldn't i update CS, i wouldn't be able to play without significant lag.  I vowed that when I got a laptop, i would have CS working on it, and i would play at school on the fibre connection.    Well, when i got my  urlLink laptop  (Christmas 2003 - the one on the website has a Athlon XP, mine has a P4) Steam had turned into a pay service.  I didn't have the cash to pay for a Valve product to play CS, so i sort of gave up on it.  Then, back in May, my friend found out a certain CD Key string that you could use to get into Steam.  The string was 3333-33333-3333, and we would just change the last 2 numbers. I got it to work for about 1 day, and then my CD Key was found to be fake, so it was canceled.    Really wanting to play CS, i bought DoD for $24.99, not bad if i do say so myself.  I launched Steam when i first opened the box, put in the key, and everything started working fine.  I had finished updating the main CS file, but when i went to play, it wouldn't let me join servers.  At this time, i didn't know about the 'auto-update' function.    When i got home last night, i brought with me a CD with the Steam CS cache.  I installed that this morning, but when i went to check the properties of the game, it said 'Not Ready'.  I waited for the % counter to go to 100% (because 100% usually means done) and launched CS.  To my amazement it actually worked.  Well, i played, and i sucked.  CS is by no means the same as DoD.    In my opinion, i think DoD is better.  Even though you get recoil, the guns are still more accurate.  And in the servers that i play in DoD, everyone voice chats, and thats fun.  I guess i'll just stick to what i like the most.  Lates
