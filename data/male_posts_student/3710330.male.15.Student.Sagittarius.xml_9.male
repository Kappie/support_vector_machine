To me, this is a day for myself to remember a threshold in my tumultuous past.       July 2004. Today is the third day of the month of July. The mornings ended in a catastrophe from the GCE Chinese 'O' levels examinations, Listening Comprehension. My heart sank so deeply after the answers were revealed to me, I felt poignant and demoralised, for the efforts I had put in the past three consecutive months had gone to the gallows. For it was this terror, that shook my results, which had been dangling ever so precariously over edge, down to the deep ravine below.       I had given up hope on Chinese, and allowed fate to decide my  outcome.       As the thunderclouds rolled away from the sky, the bright  sun came out to splash sunlight onto the the tarmac road that I was walking on. This did not, however reflect as a good sign of new hope, but a premonition of doom to me- the hot sunrays baking me, melting every piece of hope left in me.       The afternoons, turned out worst, with my mother rattling on and on about wanting me to stay for lunch. And so of course, I was obliged to stay and be late for the Passing Over parade at 3:30pm.        After my lunch, I got dressed in my scout uniform, with the yellow and red arrow scarf in place around my neck, my father came and picked my sister and I up.       I arrived at the doorsteps of my Chinese tuition teacher's house(had to pass the Oral stuff  I borrowed from her) and pressed the doorbell. I drew a circle on the floor using the tip of my shoes, and adjusted my uniform. I clutched the Oral books tightly in my hands and took a deep breath. Somehow, the eyehole in the door made me look at it with exaggerated interest. And then the   lock of the door clicked open, and the creaking of the hinges          ringed in my ears. At the door, stood a man of around fifty of age, with a paunchy stomach and a moderately wrinkled but handsome face.      It was her husband. He smiled at me and said to me jokingly," I thought you were one of those scouts here for Job week." I smiled back and passed the books to him, and said that it was for my teacher. He took the books and told me to wait while he went to ask her(as she was in the toilet) whether she had anything to tell me.              Standing at her doorsteps, I felt as though it was a year and a half ago, when I first came and considered her as a stranger...that was so long ago, I could hardly remember. And it suddenly seemed to fast, One yr and a half just flew past so quickly, her naggings, her scoldings, all seemed to float away fromm my memories. I felt a rush of emotions throughout my body, and tears had started to well up in my eyes. The gratitude I felt for her was too much for words. Somehow I still felt reminiscent of her lessons. Somehow I felt like listening to her naggings once  more. Somehow I felt like the urge to hug her.             Her husband popped up from the corner, and waved to me and told me that she had nothing to say. I wiped my tears and reached out to close the white wooden doors, of which I had so oftenly fumbled for at the end of her lessons. I locked the last of the padlocks, and stood dreamily at her door. A suddenly blast of wind  broke me from my reverie and I turned and headed for the staircase.        It was only then, that I realised she was my teacher, a benign and loving one.              I got into the car and my father drove me to my school. I was an hour late when I arrived and the scouts weren't surprised to see me. I was met with the usual sarcasms but this time, It was n't that bad. Somehow they knew and had the same feeling.        We walked together towards the pond for a photo taking session. We stood there smiling, and looking very smart. Jokes were cracked now and then, everyone conversing happily. It was nice seeing them in uniform again.           Then there was the ceremony, were Job week awards and incentives were given, first class certificates given out and the service awards for Secondary Fours given out. Then our Troop Leader, Gregory, one of my contemporaries, gave a well-prepared speech of which a few parts still remained vividly in my mind, "So, it is time for me to pass the baton the next person. But this is not a race, because it doesnt end." A truely touching speech          which displayed him relishing his glorious moments in scouting.         In a few moments, the red and yellow arrow flag was passed over to the Secondary threes, and it signified the moment of a new era. Though the duties have been passed over, but it is not over for us Secondary Fours yet. For we have merely passed over our duties. I have made my commitment to continue as a Venture Scout, and continue helping out in the Arrow Scout Group.          The ceremony ended in a buffet dinner for all, as fried noodles and rice, chicken cooked in sauce, fried lemon fish, green vegetables, satay and otak were served. The 3 remaining Sec 4s in my patrol, Raleigh, decided to follow the old tradition of eating together as a patrol, and we waited for the rest. We placed our service plaques together and took many glances at each as we joked with each other. When the whole patrol was here, it became a moment of silence, where the only sound was the slurping of the drinks, and the chewing of the food.           Li Kai passed the three of us the present that the patrol had specially prepared. A shiny metal name tag which could be hung around the neck. It had the words " GOH ENG WEI, RALEIGH PATROL, ARROW SCOUT 01-04" engraved on it. As small gift as it was, I still clutched the nametag tightly in my hands and when I put it into my pocket, I would constantly check to make sure that it was there.       And then I saw the Sec 4s, congregating in the blackness of the night, acting mysteriously. I took my bag and ran towards them.       "We're going to Cedar Campfire wanna come?" Samuel asked." Its the last time we're gonna go to a campfire together..." I pondered over it for a while, but it did not take long, for it was after all, the last campfire I'll be having.       But sadly, Kai Urn found out about us for we had previously rejected the Cedar campfire invitation as it fell on the same day as our Passing Over parade. Being a kind soul as he was, Kai Urn let us off and told us to be silent about it.              I was only in a matter of minutes that we were in a cab and off for Cedar Girl's School. The eight of us split into two groups and promised to rendevous again at Cedar Sec.       The night lights of the Singapore streets flashed by, as the taxi drove along the tree lined roads. The thought of being an uninvited guest kept flashing through my mind, and I was hoping we wouldn't result in a situation of embarassment.        We arrived at the iron bound gates at 8pm and could hear the    Emcees singing at the top of their voices along with the campfire songs. We waited for the other four for a while, and they came in a yellow taxi. We went in together, and Samuel confirmed with me that they had called up previously in the taxi and the Cedarians had arranged a seat for us.       We sat down in the midst of groups of scouts and guides, around a campfire circle. Everyone was happily dancing and singing along to the songs. We started singing together, and Patrick and Samuel led us in the dancing with their queer moves and perculiar dances. I was a bit reluctant at first, but then decided to join in the fun, for this was the time for us to let our hair down. We shaked and turned, twisted and twirled, leaped and jumped, performing every single elaborate manoevre there was. I felt a sense of euphoria, constantly laughing and enjoying every moment,. The air of camaraderie seemed to permeate the whole campfire, as everyone danced and sang happily to the songs. Though at times they seemed to be acting lame, but I followed suit the same. My heart felt much lighter from this morning, my spirits were high and I was singing at the top of my voice. I even danced with Jacob on the benches in tune with the romantic song they were playing(though it was abit gay). The day ended in us, being in our  own realm, singing our school anthem. This would the last scouting experience, in my last year in Victoria School.
