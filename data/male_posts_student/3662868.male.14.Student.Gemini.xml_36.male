I've been working on maps for Yuri's Revenge, and just hangin out and talking to some of my friends on xbox live. I've been going out with Becky for 1 week and 1 day now. I love her.        I don't really have too much on my mind right now, and that's good. As long as I don't have anything to bitch about, life is good.        Well, I'm gonna go to bed.    Goodnight.
