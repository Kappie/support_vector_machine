I mean my site was fully functional, but it got deleted within an hour. With the second place I couldn't even access the site after I uploaded it and half the site got deleted upon upload. The third was by far the worst. First, they ask me for a $5 "donation" then when I finally get the damn activation code I need the next day I find out I can't even FTP to it. So, I go through the hassle of uploading five items at a time but come to find out when I finsh the entire site looks like crap. Oh well. I guess I'll have to try a site with ads which I REALLY don't want to do considering most of the ads are either spyware or porn. GOD DAMN FREE WEB HOSTS!!!!!!  later, bradleyJ
