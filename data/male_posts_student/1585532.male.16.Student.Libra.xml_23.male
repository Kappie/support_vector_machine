I'm going to put out a press release to a few of my friends who are working it this year.  I'll go ahead and post the music selection for this year though.

Spook Show Baby – Rob Zombie (Black Cat Leather Suit Mix By Rammstein) 5. Shame – Stabbing Westward 6. Bestrafe Mich – Rammstein 7. Search and Destroy – KMFDM 8. Quake II Theme Song – Rob Zombie 9. The Dope Show – Marilyn Manson 10. Asche Zu Asche – Rammstein 11. Living Dead Girl – Rob Zombie (Naked Exorcist Mix) 12. Weisses Fleisch – Rammstein 13. Reload – Rob Zombie 14. Sehnsucht – Rammstein 15. Push It – Static X 16. Meet The Creeper (Twisted Metal Soundtrack) – Rob Zombie 17. Black and White – Static X 18.

Well, I have homework, ta.
