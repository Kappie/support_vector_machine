Do starving kids in Rwanda get to express how sad they are feeling on internet diaries?HA!  I read one guy's blog, and it was mostly: "My girlfriend won't have sex with me, wah wah." All I can say is, consider yourself lucky to even have the opportunity at it. My problems are no more important that his, but none of what is important is on anyybody's mind.  When you drive to work in the morning, do you realize how you're contributing the the millions of tonnes of CO2 dumped into the atmosphere every year, melting our icecaps, boiling us alive?  When you're at McDonalds scarfing down your large order of fries, do you realize that some kid in Ethiopia would kill you where you stand to get some of those fries?  No. No. I get more and more disgusted with soiety every day. Even me.   Now, back on the subject of my unfathomable sadness....  It seems she believes that what I said in my previous diary was some sort of passive-agressive attack at her. Rubbing my problems in her face, so to speak. As much as I'd hate to defend myself for what I said and did (it really was quite awful), I just had to say what I said. That was how I felt. I had to get it off my chest or I'd explode. What was said cannot be taken back, I know that, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still sorry. A word in edgewise: I wasn't trying to hurt her, but I did anyways. Sigh. There we see intent, yet again, amounting to nothing. Action. Action. Action. I know it's my fault, either way. Agh, just let it go, Matty.    "To believe that things either exist,   or do not exist, is a primitive   form of thought"     I can't quite remember who wrote that. Just an interesting little tid-bit I remembered just now that doesn't really relate to much....Or does it?   Let's talk about some things going on in Matty's life right now. Aside from nothing, nothing, lonliness and boredom, there are a few interesting things.  Well for starters, I'm gonna be getting braces soon. What joy that will bring me, having a face full of cold steel. Yay. You know, I never really thought my teeth were all that bad, but I guess they just kinda...Grew on me! Hahahah...ha...ha....WAAAAAAAH.  Ah yes, my mother and her commonlaw husband of seven years are splitting up. We can't afford the house on our own, so we have to move! Yaaaay. Oh, and then there's all the loss of money involved. What fun.  You know, there seems to be quite the rift between my friends and I. Perhaps it's the hundreds of miles between us all at the moment. Perhaps not. I can't help but feel...That we've only grown apart...And not closer together. And whos fault is that?    Like any good teenager would, I have generated a list of solution to my largest problem. (Are my priorities out of tune?)  1) Give myself what I had coming, leave everyone and be with0ut friends and without hope.  2) Fall out of love with, and continue to be friends with Her. Find happiness elsewhere, I suppose.  3) Killing spree.  4) Stay and shut my god damned mouth.  Like any good dilemma, it has its fair share of cons.  1) I will be even more alone, andeven more sad, but I will have got what I deserved, and everyone else will be much happier with me gone.  2) My love for her is the only thing that keeps me ticking. Sure it hurts, but it sure as hell does the trick (keeping me alive, that is). If I were to go find love elsewhere...I doubt I could find one so strong and so pure....Love like this doesn't happen twice. Hell, to some people,it doesn't even happen once.  3) Perhaps not a  spree , more or less just a few select individuals. I will give no names. Consequences could bejail, if I'm not sneaky enough....  4) Stay here, continue to offer my love and support to my close friends, whilst coming apart at the seams...Hm.  Perhaps everything will sort itself out, no?   What do I dream of now, then? Millionaire, perhaps. Money will make me happy where all else has failed. And I can donate to charities to stop all the bullshit! Everybody's happy!!!!  Peace out and PCP.
