I want to start off on a particular note, the note that basically says that Colin is a dirty, lowdown, son of a bitch. There, the start to my opinionless summary.  Ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop, telling them to take a 20-hour bus ride to Buenos Aires, where they'll get their flights to Russia. Woohoo! New destination! Anyway, the teams arrived at the bus station one by one, and everything was closed. They agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive, but when Colin  Christie talked to a ver sad man, they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time. The queue rearranged, because of that scum of the earth. Mirna pissed off a few people, and drew an absolutely ucalled for "Don't talk to me" when she tried to ask Lance what was happening. The piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams, because "that's the order in which they were there." Hello colin... I didn't see any queue!??!         The four behind teams rushed to the airport, where Charla  Mirna standbyed on a Swiss Air flight. I really don't know if they knew about the flight to Germany at this point, cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight. The twins  Bowling moms worked together while Bob  Joyce had no time to look. And everyone left... Oooh! Look who's the business loser this time. Bob  Joyce got business class seats! Haven't they learnt from 4 previous seasons? Anyway, everyone leaves and Charla  Mirna are left behind. They unexpectedly catch the Marshall  Lance flight. Like I said, I don't know if they knew already that there was this flight, but if they did, they're the airline experts for this season.  So, everyone arrives in Russia, and they find the stupid battleship. Fro the first time since the first leg, we see the Yield! The Detour: Block 5 shots, in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots. And Drink 1 shot, in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing. It's obvious to me that the drinking was much easier, and unfair also cause Charla's arms length would be too short. For some reason, there's no pictures with Charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit.         They had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of St. Petersburg, which is a waste of time route marker cause they didn't do anything there. They were then told that they had to go the the Old Tower for the most exciting Roadblock ever. Caviar, the most expensive salt there is on the market. The favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought Roadblocks I've ever seen. 1 friggin kilogram per person, which makes a total of 8 kilos. Now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks, 1kg wouls cost 500, and 8 would cost the producers a whopping S$4000!         Anyway, the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced Chip, who finished it in monster speed. The only other guy who ate, Marshall, could not match up, but was still miserably fast. Brandon and Colin are IDIOTS! The best eater was Charla, followed by Joyce. Nicole fell terribly sick, which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side. Christie did not fall as sick, which means she's perfectly normal. Oh what a chemically incorrect task, but who cares anyway?  The teams all made thier way to Catherine's Palace, their pit stop. Yadda and Bob  Joyce were eliminated! Now, the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink.
