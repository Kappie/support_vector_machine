You might want to remember it now, because you'll be screaming it later.  Pardon me miss, I seem to have lost my phone number, could I borrow yours?  The word of the day is "legs." Let's go back to my place and spread the word.  Why don't you surprise your roommate and not come home tonight?  You see my friend over there? [Point to friend who sheepishly waves from afar] He wants to know if YOU think I'M cute.  Congratulations! You've been voted "Most Beautiful Girl In This Room" and the grand prize is a night with me!  Did you know that there are 265 bones inside of your body? {Wait for answer} "Yeah, and I could show you how to get one more?"  Excuse me, I'm looking for a friend...do you want to be my friend?  Man: "So what do you do for a living?"  Woman: "I'm a female impersonator."  Man: "Haven't we met before?"  Woman: "Yes, I'm the receptionist at the Venereal Disease Clinic."  Man: "Haven't I seen you someplace before?"  Woman: "Yeah, that's why I don't go there anymore."  Man: "Is this seat empty?"  Woman: "Yes, and this one will be too if you sit down."  Man: "So, wanna go back to my place?"  Woman: "Well, I don't know. Will two people fit under a rock?"  Man: "Your place or mine?"  Woman: "Both. You go to yours and I'll go to mine."  Man: "I'd like to call you. What's your number?"  Woman: "It's in the phone book."  Man: "But I don't know your name."  Woman: "That's in the phone book too."  Man: "What sign were you born under?"  Woman: "No Parking."  Man: "Hey, baby, what's your sign?"  Woman: "Do Not Enter."  Man: "How do you like your eggs in the morning?"  Woman: "Unfertilized!"  Man: "Hey, come on, we're both here at this bar for the same reason."  Woman: "Yeah! Let's pick up some chicks!"  Man: "I can tell that you want me."  Woman: "Ohhhh. You're so right. I want you to leave."  Man: "Hey cutie, how 'bout you and I hitting the hot spots?"  Woman: "Sorry, I don't date outside my species."  Man: "May I see you pretty soon?"  Woman: "Why? Don't you think I'm pretty now?"  Man: "Your hair color is fabulous."  Woman: "Thank you. It's in aisle three at the corner drug store."  Man: "Your body is like a temple."  Woman: "Sorry, there are no services today."  Man: "I'd go through anything for you."  Woman: "Good! Let's start with your bank account."
