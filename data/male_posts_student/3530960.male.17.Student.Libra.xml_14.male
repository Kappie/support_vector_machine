I rented out the clubhouse at my dad's apartment, and they've got some nice tables there and billiards too, so it should be pretty nice.  I ordered these "Bush Cards" off the internet that have little known facts about the administration (like Karl Rove's nickname is 'Turd Blossom') and I'm going to break them out tonight.
