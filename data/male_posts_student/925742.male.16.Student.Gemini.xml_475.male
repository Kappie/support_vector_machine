Oh, well, our scores were still the best.  Muahah.  Alex and I worked, and drove around and stuff.  Friday I got out of class early in 3rd hour to head to Des Moines to get some official birth papers to get my Dutch Passport.  Bunch of loopholes.  Along the way, Derek told me more about how Nostradamus (that one guy in Iowa City) knows Wing Tsun and Hapkido, and is a bad motherfucker who just spanges in his freetime.  On our way back we listened to Bad Religion and the Clash.  That night we played 2 hours of Onslaught on the LAN.  Yesterday I worked for 5 hours with Alex, and he got money.  After that we chilled at the mall and I got 4th high score in Galaga.  Yet more chilling occured when I got home and played some games and talked to my femalre companionship interest.  Then Alex came by and we drove through the ghettoes of Omaha and later stuff happened when we got back into town.    o_O               (thats my, memory is shot face)  Today I went to brunch with Gary and Tamara at Ameristar.  I'll probably do some stuff later, but for now, I am, gonna switch to FireBird web browser.
