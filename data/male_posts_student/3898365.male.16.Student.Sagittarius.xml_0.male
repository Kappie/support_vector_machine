I went to drawing class today, and I was angry at first because he was making me feel bad because my drawings looked a lot more like the things we had to draw than almost everyone else's. And because I had to keep staring at a mirror I was holding ridiculously close to my face. He had us draw enlarged sections of our face (the eyes, a nose, a mouth, and anything else) all on separate sheets of paper. Towards the end of class he had us take all those drawings and glue them together in order to make a giant face. My face looks really angry. I swear, I wasn't drawing any of the sections angry, and by themselves they looked nice, but now with it all together, both eyebrows are in a sort of glare and it looks like he's baring his teeth. Like he's snarling or something. Some of the faces people put together ended up being taller than the person that drew it. He said I did great today, and I liked my final product, so I wasn't angry when I left.    I'm going to have to miss a class. The one on the 31st, because of stupid family reunion campout week.    Susie and Kit drove me to and from class, which was very nice of them. It seems like every time I'm in the van with Susie driving she invites me to go somewhere with their family. This time she said how I should go down to California with them some time.    I went over to Talbert with Jenny after I got home. She was right when she said there wasn't much to do. We hiked around a little bit, and it was pretty out there, but just to hot and humid for hiking.    I got home about 1:00pm and started cleaning. Okay, I cleaned my room, I vacuumed the entire house - even my parent's bedroom, which they never require me to do, I did all the dishes in the sink, I cleaned the upstairs bathroom, I tidied up the kitchen counter, I cleaned my brother's messes in the family room and in the living room, I washed all the towels and everything else in the laundry room and proceeded to fold and put them all away, and I watered all of my parent's plants. I was satisfied from a job well done, so at about 4:00pm, I ventured over to my bed and took a nap.    I wake up, and it was 6:00pm. I hear the television on downstairs. Apparently, my brother never went to the beach. And now he and Sarah were home. And it was obvious that they were. They had dishes all over the kitchen and messes and messy and fuck fuck fuck.    So by the time parents get home, the house is going to be how it was when they left. This just fucking sucks. I mean, I still know that I cleaned and it gave me something productive to do, but now it just seems like it was for nothing.    God, I can't wait until I get my own place of residence.    Those Coppertone Sunscreen commercials make me mad. You know those two commercials that talk about how people get skin cancer? It seems like they're using scare tactics to get you to buy sunscreen. But me? I still look to Lewis Black's  The White Album  for my advice on sunscreen.    Mmmm. Lewis Black. I love you, you angry, angry Jew.    I got  Transformer  by Lou Reed and  It's Not Funny  by David Cross.   Dude... dude. That 1993 "I Love the 90's." They're talking about "Quantum Leap." A couple people talk about whose body they would jump into if they could. Scott Stapp comes on and says, "I wouldn't jump into anybody. I'm happy with who I am." Okay, even if you look past the fact that what he said is insanely self-centered and egotistical, at least he could make something up. You know, the reason they interview people is so they can show funny clips and entertain people. Scott, just go die.
