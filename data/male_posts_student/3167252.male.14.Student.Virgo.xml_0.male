Lolz, can't believe it manz, I didn't shout or curse or swear at all when I was so worried over Merrill, Vernon and my bike and here is Joanne, calling me a senseless creature because I hit her accidentally. Well, it all happened today when Frederick wanted to squeeze my hand again, so being the sporting guy I am, I agreed. Hahaz, then as I was about to lose, I spotted my water bottle on the floor (Clumsy Alvin) and used that as an excuse to quit the squeeze(?!?!) But Frederick didn't want to let go so I had to pull my hand out. When I did that, I accidentally hit Joanne. Well, that stupid girl just stared at me as I returned to my seat. As if she was trying to give me a look of disgust. Hmmm, can't really stand that. I'd rather fight than continue taking it. So I can only just curse her silently.   Hahaz, I'm proud that i'm such a better person than her aniwaez. Still, can't get arrogant I guess. Yea Clara, Yea Carrie, I think i'm better than you. -Deleted- and stop discussing about me like i'm some sorta poor guinea pig. I hate it when people do that. I think i'll kill the next person who does that. People at school don't know me like people outside. Clara actually thinks i'm bad with adults? That's such a gross error. Then and again, no one really knows me. The school ppl see my bad side, the outside people see my good side but it's the strangers who I really confess my real self to. Hahaz, I don't claim to have that much experience, but let's just say that I have an interesting sexual history starting from 4 or 5. Furthurmore, I mix around with more people than they(Carrie and Clara) know. Carrie mixes with DJs, I mix with family counsellors. Bleahz, shouldn't have said that but i'll leave them. Just annoyed that they think i'm a total idiot. Heard Sharon and Ting Yan diss Byron's sister today.. "She's an airport strip". Hmmmm, Clara? Just wondering what is she.. Enemy or friend? I strongly believe in the reasoning that there are no grey areas in life. Clara is an enemy. 'cos she still has all these negative impressions of me even though she still talks to me. But that's only because she is depressed or something.  Dunno, I know i've had a bad reputation but i'm not going to let that get me down. I'll just kill anyone who gets in my way. Lolz, guess that's why i'm not good at project work, speakin of which IPW is totally screwed. But you know what? I'm digging my heels in. Everyone always wants me to be leader to be the scrapegoat. Enough! I shall decimate and annihilate all of YOU!!
