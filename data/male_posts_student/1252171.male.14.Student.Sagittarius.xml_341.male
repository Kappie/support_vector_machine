Later, when I got back home, I got Excel Saga Vol. 6 and Azumanga Daioh Vol. 2. My mom ordered Excel Saga Vol. 3, 4, and 5, so I got those too. Then today I went to Barnes and Noble and got Azumanga Daioh Vol. 1 and Steel Angel Kurumi Vol. 1. I would've gotten Excel Saga Vol. 7, but they didn't have it. *Cries.* *Sob,* so I'm hoping that I might find it and buy it while we're in Maine, which, may I add, we're going to tomorrow. SI out! -Sane Intolerant-
