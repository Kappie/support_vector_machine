I'm a bad human being, and I'm only compounding my crimes against humanity by relating this here.  I was flipping through the cable channels.  I came across a cable access channel.  And there was a man sitting at a desk with a device in front of him.  The man has some sort of a physical disability.  He could not speak and he appeared to have limited control over the movements of his body.  He was poking the device in front of him with a stick, and each time he poked it, the device would speak in a computer synthesized voice.  Each. Word. Was. Spoken. Individually. While. He. Poked. The. Device.  This, by itself is not funny.  But in the corner of the screen, was a woman doing the sign language interperetation of what the man was saying through the synthesized voice.  And she looked really confused waiting for each word to be pronounced before making the hand motions.    Ok.  Maybe that's not funny.  But I laughed.  I'm sorry.
