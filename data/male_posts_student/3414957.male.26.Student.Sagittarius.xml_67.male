Thank God that there is one air conditioner near the "customer" computer area so that I do not have to smell B.O. if it gets too hot. In my area, I have only fans! It sucks.  I have the urge to beat the living shit out of my neighbor. His stupid f*ing dog will not shut up and the housing manager says all we can do is complain to animal control. Eventually it will take up to a year or more to evict these scumbags according to the manager. All I want to do is file a complaint with this guys face with my fist. That will solve it. Then he would shut his dog up and shut his fat wife up too. But....I know I would go to jail and I would seem like a bad guy but this guy's stupid dog barks 24/7 and wakes me up almost every night and annoys everybody in the neighborhood during the day. I have a plan though...it takes me bak to my more devious days. Nuff' said.
