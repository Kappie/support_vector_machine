Whew, i said I was supposed to update my journal, didn't I? well, journal still untouched, I found that if i keep on delaying, the memorable part of my life would be forgotten.   Ok, i shall began with last Friday.. I missed the ferry and so decided to take the bus to the city, another bus came along and I thought might as well board the bus and alight at the 'interchange' to transfer to the city as it will be faster. And I met Yun on the bus, what a coincidence. Haa, never expect to met her on the bus.. Anyway, I was still late for school.. reached at around 430pm. Class ends at 9pm. Again, I was learning new stuff during the practical session. Practical ended a bit later then usual. So I walked to the city central, wanting to buy a 10-trip savers. I also exchanged the free Mars bar which I won at the convenience store.. I was about to go to the bus stn and I bumped into Yun and her friend. Haha, what a super coincidence. In the end we went for a drink at Southbank ya. Her friend stayed 1 street from where I am staying.   Stayed at home over the weekend. Serene and Michelle went to Gold Coast for the Single Adults Resort getaway.  Ok, I am going to take up latin dancing class, saw the people dancing at the cafe on Friday and got interested. Ha, am thinking of taking up beginners golf too. There's a wakeboarding/waterskiing session on Saturday. Will be joining that with WengChuan and Shubhendro( fellow NTu students studying at QUT)  Went to QUT with Dominic for the National DAy celebration organised by the SSA. Quite interesting.. Bought curry rice for lunch. Anyway, stayed in school to do some homework before heading back home.  Cooked curry chicken at home with the ready made paste. Had rice and prata for dinner.. haha so fatty.. After which we went to watch National day prarade at Andrew's place. End up singin National Day songs instead because the live streaming is slow.  Ok, Ekka(australian fun fair day) day on Wed == no school!  Want to go there but WX not going neither is Serene. Michelle going on Friday which I can't really go because I have class. Asked Wengchuan and he told me he went there on Sat with his housemate. Asked yun and she is busy this week with her research. Wah liew.. sian. Looks like I got to give this a miss, stupid and no fun going alone..  Ok, i got to go. Have to update my journal. Hope everything fine back home.  Ciaoz.
