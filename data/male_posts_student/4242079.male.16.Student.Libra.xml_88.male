But seriously, it's appreciated that he at least tried to fix it, even if I do end up stranded somewhere in the middle of the night. It will be an adventure for all.   My district manager was in the store yesterday, and if I want to transfer to Lethbridge at the end of summer, then the job is mine. If not, I'm free to stay here. I don't know. In one way, I want so badly just to leave, just to forget all of this. Another part of me, however, is saying that I should stay, see how some things pan out. I mean, today, today could just be a shitty day, right? And maybe all in all, it'll be a shitty month, but things have got to get better, right? I'm just not sure.   I need $200. Right now. Well, ok, not  right  now, but soon, by Wednesday, and payday is Friday. Maybe I'll go pawn off my laptop...those places keep things for a bit so you can buy them back, right? Isn't that how they work? Or is that those payday loan places? I just don't know.  Tonight, I'm supposed to go out with Edward and Nikki and presumably Miranda. Hopefully it will dig me out of this stupid little hole. I'm so fucking broke though, but still, I need to get out of this house, to forget about things for a bit....
