And, even worse, they seem to be stepping out from behind the mask as something I never imagined them to be. Not that it's a bad thing (well, not all the time), but so often things are different once we realize that our brethren were never really one of us. Or, rather, we were never one of them. When they turn out to be so much more complex and beautiful than we ever knew, we are humbled that we ever doubted them. Yet all too often I've found that people were much uglier inside than I had deemed them.  Some of us have an awful tendency to conceal so much of what we are to find another part of us that we know isn't there. What we are REALLY doing is just trying to impress someone, or fit in when we know that if someone cared about us, they would accept us for what we are. All these little games we play only complicate things, especially when we didn't know we were playing a game, or, worse, when we knew but didn't care.  Not feeling accepted or loved is one of the worst feelings in the world. Believe me, I know. Still, it's worse to feel like the only reason anybody cares about you is because you are being what they tell you too.     Keeping it real, Hunter M.
