So, Bri's decided to updated everyone on my love life. Yes, it's true. Go you, Bri!   In other news, I've been eating more healthy than ever! Go healthiness. I haven't eaten anything other than fruits, vegetables, white meat, whole wheat bread, and yogurt/cheese in like three months.   I'll resume life later.
