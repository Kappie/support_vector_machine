Why is the price so low?  It says right in the packet:  This compilation is not about making a profit; it's about making a difference .  Followed by this: It's not about "let's be punk rock and hate the government"; it's about "let's be punk rock and change the government"  and   It's not about who's a sellout or who's more punk; it's about uniting against a common enemy.   I watched the DVD and from what I saw, I had the same feeling of when I got War on Errorism by NOFX about a year ago.  I felt renewed anger, which isnt always a bad thing.  The DVD holds trailers to documentaries you can buy, music videos, and even a short comedian clip.  The pamphlet also contains a nice little forward by Fat Mike.  Don't forget some of the allstar bands that are on this comp, to see who they are go back to my old entry about a month ago when I first found out about this cd.  This is a solid comp with a raw message, dvd with extra fun, and 26 different bands, and dont forget, it is only about 10 bucks.
