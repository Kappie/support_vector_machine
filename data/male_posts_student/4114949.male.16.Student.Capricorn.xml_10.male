Some ignorant asshole brought a  BABY  into the film, and it was kicking and screaming the whole way through, so my dad complained and we got a refund. Result :p  I got a text from Gemma at the end of the film. She said she was with Jeremy (Her new boyfriend; kind of) and his mates, and she said she was having a shitty time, surrounded by stoners, so she text me for, and I quote 'some intelligent conversation'. I love that girl.  Other than that, I've not done much today, it's been cool though, just relaxing.  Oh yeah, I got my  READING Festival  tickets through the post yesterday, which I'm incredibly happy about, because I was scared they wouldn't come. This time in 3 weeks I'll be seeing Placebo, Bloc Party, Supergrass, Morrissey, White Stripes, Libertines, Ash, The Hives, Secret Machines, Graham Coxon, Razorlight, The Stills, 22/20's and Modest Mouse. YAY!     Jack
