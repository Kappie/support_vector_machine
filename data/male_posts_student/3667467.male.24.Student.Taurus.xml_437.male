You can also get two mouse traps for a dollar. Anyway, I hate rats. One time I went down in the basement to "help" my dad fix a water heater, and what did I almost step on but a dead rat the size of an adult cat. With the tail it could have been 18 inches long. Then my father asked me to get rid of it, but I could barely step over its corpse to run back upstairs. So in some respects I hope we don't catch the rat, because the last thing I want to see waking up in the morning is a dead rat on my kitchen floor. And remember, when using manual rat traps the worst thing isn't finding a dead rat, it's finding half a dead rat.
