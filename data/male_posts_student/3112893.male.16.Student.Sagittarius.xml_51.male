Anyway, I guess I should do something to celebrate, so here's some stuff I wrote on the plane from Chicago to Boston in SPECIAL UNEDITED FORM :-D. I'd sort it all out and write a nicer post, but I'm in a rush to get to work, so I'll do that later. Just a warning, but each blog post usually goes through like 2 or 3 edits, so I just thought I might warn you. Also, just a random fact, but I start my posts with the hyphen things and expand each idea. They just serve as a kind of reminder of things I deemed worthy to blog, and each one of the hyphens comes out to about -- I dunno, one or two six-sentence paragraphs? I also hack out a bunch of stuff so you might find in the edited version after this, that there will be entire paragraphs missing. It's not that I'm evil, but I try to save myself SOME embarrassment. Anyway, the unedited version i.e. Brain dump:  - didn't want to leave boston... at all - thought i over-slept this morning, but didn't, had mixed feelings - talked to people this morning - read "something positive" - cleaned up the attic a bit, consolidated boxes and the like - read more comics - cleaned a bit more - played guitar for a bit - fell asleep briefly in the lovesack left by andrew and anindita - thought about what to do with PB the piggie and went to pet store to buy a carrier for him and went to the vet to get his papers, but in our valiant effort, still failed to get him onto the plane. Fucking AA bummerness. - went to the airport to drop me off and try to get the people at AA to let me take him on the plane, but like stated above, failed - i got other stuff through fine and waited in terminal - talked to people on sidekick and ended up missing plane because i never heard any last call made, and had mixed feelings about it - set myself up for a later flight through Chicago that would arrive in LA at like 1AM. hey, it's better than nothing, right? - found out that on domestic flights, regardless of whether or not the passenger is on the plane, the luggage still stays on the plane. I didn't know this and thought the international policy went with everyone - bought some food and donuts at the airport, the food for me, the donuts for javaneh because she had asked for them - waited around and talked on sidekick some more. - i miss kat when i don't talk to her for a while. i feel myself getting addicted to her, along with christina. i miss christina a lot. i hope everything with her is going alright - i got on the plane to chicago and it all went well except for the constant nausea I was experiencing. I discovered I can't wear my retainer when I fly because i get freaked out and gag for some reason. Creepin' myself out, here. the flight attendant gave me club soda and i felt a bunch better. i slept most of that flight and sang modest mouse in a half-asleep drunken fashion for the rest of the time - i landed in chicago and walked to the gate and all was well. i got to see clinton speak and he was FUCKING AWESOME!! i mean, wow. just wow. I also met some interesting people from just north of lost angels who were quite funny armchair politicians - felt sick at the start of the flight from chicago and got more club soda, but this time made me feel worse. creepin' me out more. also, i had a headache and asked the dude if he could get me some asprin, but he didn't have any pain killers so the dude in front of me gave me his advil liquid gels and the headache went away. what a nice guy, aside from the fact his chair was down the whole time, the pills made up for it though :-D - found out just how unfitting bob dylan really is to the movie "laws of attraction" - wrote this list on the plane and will probably just obsess over kat and christina and dream about them for the rest of the flight. I'm a bit of a loser, i know. I miss them both so much. i wish i could talk to them online on the plane, even though Christina's in like Florida without an internet connect. It makes me sad. Anyway, i was talking to kat before the plane took off and i told her that i liked her personality, as flat out as i could without having my heart and head explode. She said I was "such a suck up" to which I replied "that might be true, but I can't help it, really... Well, I guess i could but I REALLY don't want to. :-)" Isn't she pretty? She's the one on the right with dark hair.   :'( before i make myself throw up at my own loser-like obsessive behavior, i'll just stop and keep it all in until i crack. that's how i usually handle it and while the tactic's never worked the way i wanted in the long run, it's the only one i can do without hating myself while i do it.  Moving on, the past days haven't been bad. they were like the other ones though. i mean, andrew and anindita moved a lot more stuff in and i got taken out to dinner for helping at route 99; not a bad place. "cheap meat" as chloe likes to say. She's cute too :-), but i don't have any picture to show. Andrew's mom and sister (Chloe) saw the house for the first time last night and really liked it. How could they not? The place is great. Really, it is great and I'm not letting my 5 years of living there taint my rating.  A few thoughts of the day, I feel like I never had a real childhood. When I think back to when I was little, from about 7 to 15, I don't remember things like friends, family, and fun times. I remember more things like worry, fighting, loneliness, tough and painful existential questions, and self-hate. I also remember this constant pressure to be something greater than I could possibly conceive at the age. I miss the days when I knew I had the option to just spend the day and waste it. I think that's why I'm having such a hard time growing up now. I don't feel like I ever had a "real" childhood, so I keep craving it and since there's no real structure in place to force me to grow up, i try to go back. Whenever I think about it though, I just get depressed because it only amplifies the fact that now I'm 16.65 or so and I just simply don't have the time to do that anymore. I need to grow up fast now, get my act together, and my ass in gear to get into a great college because I know if I don't shoot for the best, I'll hate myself for selling myself short and will want to die. I hate the catch 22 that my mind has for me. I know that somewhere in me there's the key to the box with the solution to this problem, but that would take time to find, time I don't have because i've got so much shit to do, like learn a fuckload of math and study for those damn SATs again and just all these things that MIT or places like that would want to see. Maybe I fucked up. Maybe I need to take a year off and take my time. Why am I killing myself to get to the same place as everyone else at the same age? My life situation was not normal by almost any means and, while in a lot of ways it was easier, it was made dramatically harder in other ways.  It also dawned on me today just how few friends I have that aren't related to my dad's work. I know close to NO ONE that I can speak openly with without worrying that it will effect my dad's career or something like that. It's so depressing for me because it makes me feel truly alone in the world, like if I were to die, how full would the church be, really? Would the few people who knew me in life fly from their cities to see me for one final time? I'd like to think so, and I know my family would show up, but they're kind of obligated to. But would Ali show up, would Dan show up, would Chris, Tim, or Andrew show up? I honestly don't know if they'd show up more for me or the ramifications of not coming because of my dad. It makes me just... :'(  Anyway, I think I've whined to all of you enough and if you actually read the paragraphs above without just skimming, you're one of my new favorite people.  Moving on, I'm writing this post on the plane from Chicago to LA, and I'm now listening to the audiobook for The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien, and I feel I have to say that I like the theology of Tolkien a bit better than the christian one. I mean, perhaps if christianity weren't taken so literally, it might be more reasonable, but people seem to be stupid and like to take things as they see it and not read into the important parts of it. The Silmarillion, however, is kind of hard to take as pure fact, even though I'm sure some silly people do, because it's so... fanciful. I've listened to The Silmarillion a few times before, so I know the majority of major parts of the stories by heart and I think that they are all really great because they carry the same great morals of the biblical-style stories, but they don't... what do I mean to say? They don't make it out to -- well, it's, like, harder for me to take as pure fact and seems harder to turn into a tool with which to breed hate. I don't know, I just REALLY love the books. They're awesome. I think that if people here get into reading in general and have 15 bucks, go to a book store and buy the purple paperback with a picture of elves sitting on grass by a body of water and some trees. I'm sorry for not just giving the publisher's name, but I've forgotten it so I did my best to describe the cover. In any event, it's a great book so go buy it and read it when you get a chance :-).  Oh, also, by the way, I've been spelling Anindita's name Anandita. I've been wrong. It's Anindita. I just thought I'd make that clear :-).  That is all. -- Feanor
