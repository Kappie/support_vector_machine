Let me introduce, My Popup Killer (MPK), it has an automatic mode that will close popup windows automatically, or a manual mode where you pick what windows to block. Plus other stuff. It's definitely my favourite popup blocker so far because of it's simplicity and efficiency! I know there's alot of pop-up blockers out there, but I recommend this one.   urlLink Here is the site it tells me to go to  hope you can find it, seems to have slipped away for now, but ifnot, just Google it or whatever I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.      ----------------- Thanks, ~Brian M
