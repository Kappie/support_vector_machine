I've been working on a pen  ink drawing that's adapted from Durer's Erasmus of Rotterdam. I'm just sticking all sorts of different stuff in the background. This is basically an excuse to play with my new pen nibs and be  artistic  again. I don't feel productive right now, even though I am for the most part. I'm reading, writing (online), playing chess, working, working out, and even drawing.  I feel like working out has resulted in a visual difference, but I don't feel energized. I'm probably not eating sufficiently to cover the calorie burning.  Oh... I got an FM transmitter from Best Buy and it works pretty well. I need to burn some CDs to play in the car.  ***
