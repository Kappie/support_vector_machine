If the ending of the Matrix left you this empty hole in your soul where you need some sort of closure, then go see this movie.  Fairly true to the book, although Jim says that they could have easily thrown in another hour of extra stuff.  We shall see.  But go, watch, and be happy.  Second, I think I have grown to not stand my little brother.  Maybe this is just because of who I am.  For those of you who dont know me, Im very straight edge.  I've just recently learned that he smokes, drinks, and has been smoking weed since he was a Sophomore in High School.  Just totally the opposite of me.  Not that I am against any of this, but he isnt the person that I grew up with.  Not in the slightest.  So today, I woke him up at 11 because I needed to move my green Ikea bookshelf out of my old room and into my new one.  I have no pity on him because all he does is stay up all night playing either Xbox or online poker.  Get a fucking life.  The room is a pit.  Dirty clothes everywhere, baskets of clothes all over the place, his guitars and bass are leaned up against my shelf, so I try and do a bit of moving so I can actually do my work.  I put the guitars on the bed and not thinking, I put a box on his fairly brand new guitar.  Needless to say, it breaks 3 of his strings and he claims his bridge and pickup are gone too (complete bullshit as I pick up the thing and look at it), so later as Im halfway done with my stuff he comes upstairs all pissed that he had to be woken up, sees the guitar, and flips out.  Yelling, screaming, cursing ensues, and I am pissed...  I said I was sorry, but if he had actually cleaned up or taken care of his own stuff, this could have been avoided, right?  That, and Im pissed at his lack of responsibility.  Where the fuck does he get the idea that I have to buy him a new guitar when he owes me almost $150 in cell phone charges.  If we go back to the days of the mafia, I should have every right to not only take his stuff and pawn it, but I should be able to destroy it at will.  So fuck off Tony, it was an accident, and if you dont take care of your shit, then I dont care what happens to it.  Angry.  Rage.  And now the parents are on my ass.  I fucking hate my life and I hate being here.  Fuck my dreams of going into medicine.  Now, all I want to do is just escape...
