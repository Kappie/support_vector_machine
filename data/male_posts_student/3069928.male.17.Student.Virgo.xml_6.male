First they try to bastardize your name, Arnold, then you poke fun at them by calling them "girlie men," and they want  you  to appologize? If you ask me, I think they need to be "Terminated."    But anyways... moving on...    In wars, we have heros, villains, neutrals, civilians, good guys, bad guys, etc... but also remember, every war has its fair share of selfish cowards.    The war we are fighting today is no exception to that.    So far, during the Iraq war, the list of "Hi! I'm a cowardly nation who gives into the feeble threats of barbaric terrorists!" has grown to three nations strong: Spain, El Salvador, and now most recently, the Philippines.      So why did they pull out? Let's see, I'll narrow it down to 3 possibilities for everyone (including the liberals who are reading this.):    a.) They love cheese.  b.) Allowing gays and lesbians to marry is more important.  c.) They are scared of faceless cowards who love to kill innocents.    If you answered "c" give yourself a pat on the back! If you answered either "a" or "b" please leave this blog immediately and go sky diving.  DO NOT  use a parachute. Thank you.    Moving on. The Philippines withdrew their entire 51-man force from Iraq over the weekend, and completed the withdrawl on Monday. Why did they do this? Because a Philippino truck driver was captured by some rag-tag band of terrorist thugs (most likely affiliated with our friend Abu Musab al-Zarqawi), who threatened to end his life (probably by decapitation--that seems to be a serious fad out in Iraq as of late) if the Philippino government didn't withdrawl its troops from Iraq. Of course, being the backstabbers they are, they high-tailed it out of Iraq like a bunch of Frenchmen... or as Arnold woul put it: "Girlie men."    So why should the US be angry about this? It's very simple. Whenever you give into a demand of someone or something, you feed that which demands it--you give it hope, you give it more resolve, and it boosts morale. In this case, the boosting of morale is taking place on the other side of the fence: apparently, it's a great time to be an Islamic Fundamentalist fighting jihad against the millions of Christian "infidels" and Jewish "invaders" (aka "Zionist Pigs") spread all across the world. For people who don't understand what I'm getting at, let me map out a more "American" scenario...     Billy the Bully: Hey there 4-eyes! Where are you going!      Hapless Harold: Uhh... I uhhh... am going to lunch.      Billy the Bully: Oh really? Want to do a favor for me?      Hapless Harold: Ummm      Billy the Bully: Of course you do! If you don't I'll bust your skull!      Hapless Harold: P-p-please Billy, I'll do whatever you want me to!!!      Billy the Bully: Go and buy me lunch.      Hapless Harold: But....      Billy the Bully: JUST DO IT!      Hapless Harold: Oh... oh ok... just don't hurt me!     Now see, if you were Billy in that instance, wouldn't you feel empowered with some sort of overwhelming control of your environment after you made poor Harold give into your demands? Yes, of course you would--it's human nature. And that's exactly what's going on in Iraq these days. The terrorists are winning the political war because we have a bunch of French-like allies backing out on us. What do we do? Simple. We boycott and cut off economic benefits with Spain, El Salvador, and the Philippines. The US is the most economically influential nation in the entire world... we can make or break the backs of ANYONE (with maybe the exception of China) just by changing our trade policies with any given country.    And I think that's what the US government should do. This is a war where there is no middle ground--an epic stuggle of good vs. evil. A massive battle to the death. You're either with us--or you're against us. Either way, it is the choice of those countries to decide that, but if they are against us, then they will parish just as swiftly at the tips of our blades as the fanatics of radical Islam do.    And we really can't have cheese-eating surrender monkeys like the Philippines compromising our mission because it's an inconvenience to them. Don't like the way we do things? Go and play a game of diplomatic grab-ass with the bloodsucking European Union--I'm sure they'll LOVE to have another pinch-hitter in their baseball game of collectivist multi-latteralism.    Oh and one last word to the Philippines... you're a bunch of girlie men.
