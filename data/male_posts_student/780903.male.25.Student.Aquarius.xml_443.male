Employers can't really care If all the transcripts are equal, no grades to compare It’s a B-plus, I can't complain, with a B-plus ~ work's done in vain, with a   B-plus ~ firm jobs are waiting for you  (slutty girl sings) Slept with the teacher and he made me a promise But the grading's blind ~ B-plus (arrogant guy sings) Stole me a copy of the test in December What a useless find ~ B-plus We took the bar-bri courses and we read each book the Coop had But now we got our grades back and we're all left to feel stupid   What do we do?  You know you can't really care If all the transcripts are equal, no grades to compare It’s a B-plus, I can’t complain, with a B-plus ~ work's done in vain, with a   B-plus ~ law review's waiting for you (Well, not exactly.)  And if you are a gunner and you study every weekend And though by finals time you're ready to jump off the deep end Grades are the same  You know you can't really care If all the transcripts are equal, no grades to compare It’s a B-plus, I can't complain, with a B-plus ~ work’s done in vain, with a   B-plus ~ diploma is waiting for you
