This year's first song: It Don't Mean a Thing (If it Ain't Got That Swing. After the parade we all walked over to a park in CG for after-parade things (food, etc.).  2. I marched behind a mower for quite a spell today. Did 1 lawn last night, 1 today, and started 2 today.  Add to that, I got to sleep at midnight. Not that late considering Jamie and Becky got to sleep 4-5ish. I shouldn't be complaining, but I'm tired and my feet hurt.  Today's song: Hard Day's Night, The Beatles  Time to veg until I get too tired to stay awake anymore.
