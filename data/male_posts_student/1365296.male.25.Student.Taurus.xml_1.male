I've been sitting here flipping between  Joan of Arcadia  and  Star Trek: TNG .  Normally I would enjoy watching  Joan , but its not a particularly good episode.  Basically, wheelchair guy gets laid for the first time after his accident, detective dad has a breakdown, and Joan watches over troubled kids and teaches them the glories of the violence known as the pinata which pisses off the head girl in charge because it somehow reminds her of the beatings her dad gave her.  Oh the joys.   TNG  is equally unimpressive.  Its season two, so there's the main reason.  In a more detailed synopsis, Dr. Pulaski contracts a strange virus or antibody that makes her even older than she already is.  And it was all caused by the genetically engineered humans that are telepathic and can move objects with their minds.  If there's one thing everyone should know, seasons one and two were shitty.  Some episodes were okay, such as season one's "Conspiracy" and "The Neutral Zone".  Season two's only good episode is "Q Who", and that's only because it introduced the Borg.  I'm convinced that the suckiness known as seasons one and two are the result of Gene Roddenberry.  Why do i say this?  Well, they are similar to the original series.  There were some good episodes, but the rest were shit.  I mean, come on.  Roman gods occupying a planet?  That's just goofy.  "But its science fiction, man!"  Bullshit.  Its futuristic Greek mythology.  Its Dungeons  Dragons in space.  Oh well.  TNG got good come season three, so it all works out in the end.  The remaining five seasons redeem the show by ten fold, maybe more.  Now if only SpikeTV would start playing  DS9  in the right order.  Fucking bastards!
