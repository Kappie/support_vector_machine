Her first day present at work for orientation is tomorrow. What that means for me is that she's out of my hair. If I had a life I would go drive and hang out with friends. As it stands I don't have any. Actually I strike that statement. I've been talking to Jason who lives in Liberty, MO but who has a bunch of friends in Overland Park. He's nice, funny, gay, single, and to accurately quote Alycia: "is SO cute". It's good to know people in your area with similar interests who know more people in the area with similar interests. One can never have to many gay or gay-friendly friends. Especially in Kansas City. That's all for now. I'll be back with some pictures from the Colorado/Utah trip later.
