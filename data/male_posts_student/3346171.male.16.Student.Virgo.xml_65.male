I came back home and went to the beach, but there was no Sun, and i had to go home, But, i didn't, i got some movies. The guys at the video store know me already. I got "Mona Lisa Smile", i liiiked alot, and Panic in the woods, not that much good, i knocked my head once - i get frightned easily-.  I guess i'll go to a party of my niece's school. I'm soooooo not in the mood!!!!!  Well.. that's vacation!
