Pray hard to remember. A doorway to the heart Beckons your mind!  And now, a corner of night, can lift the weight from you. It's in your hands. If just you understand.  A destiny lost. A bond that's been broken. The memories, of a time That slipped away.  Just open your mind The way lies before you. A doorway to the heart You seek to find.  Love can change the key you hold Into a gilded chance. So tear a memory from your mind And make it so real.  {Chorus 1}  Blue star above me, Your mystic shimmer tells of love, I should know. Whisper your secret. To soothe my doubt and calm my fear.  Blue star above me, When shadows lengthen and the dark Looms ever closer, Turn on your shine and hold me near.  {Bridge}  When the comet pulls the bow, The stars begin their dance.  The time when destiny and hope Will give birth again.  {Chorus 2}  Then if it's to be, I'll find a glimmer of the life, I should know.  Only that moment Can show me what I hold so dear.  Until that moment, I'll find some comfort in a love Within my slumber Turn on your charm and hold me near.  {Repeat Chorus 1}"     urlLink Click here to listen to Lunar 2 Battle Theme     urlLink Click here to listen to Luna BoatSong     urlLink Click here to listen Lunar Opening Theme
