Yesterday Tyke and the family got on a train in King's Cross Station in London and headed northward for the great Scot-land.  It was about a 4 hour train ride and Tyke spent the first hour playing cards with his dad and then he listened to music for the next 3 hours.  It was really a pretty easy little train ride and even though it was wet and rainy outside the scenery was pretty nice too.  It had just poured earlier apparently so it was a bit surprising that the train tracks weren't flooded.  Once they got into Edinburgh they took a taxi to their housing.  It is really an incredibly nice place to stay.  The place is an apartment that some guy rents out and it is a really great flat.  He has made it pretty nice and modern as it has a great LCD screen for the TV, DVD player, CD player, CDs, DVDs, new furniture, and just so much great stuff.  There are multiple rooms and 4 beds too.  Tyke is going to go out and film the place when he gets back so you can see it later.  But last night Tyke just watched some football and went to sleep.  If you didn't know, it gets darker later on at night here as well as getting light earlier on in the morning so the days are of course longer.  That means it is still light out pretty much whenever Tyke goes to bed at night.  Then again, the latest Tyke has gone to bed is like 10:30.  But today Tyke woke up about 9 and then got himself all ready and took his Erythromycin.  He still isn't fully recovered as he has a runny nose and still can't hear out of his right ear very well, although the left one isn't too bad.  But he'll hopefully be fine soon.  Tyke came down to the train station in the morning and got breakfast, came here to scope things out, and then his mom got a few things checked out for traveling.   After that they went up to Edinburgh Castle which was marvelous.  The views were spectacular and he really loved the visit there.  He began to walk around on his own and then just went off separately.  He decided to go down the street his apartment his on and look for The Royal Palace at Holyrood (or something like that).  But he didn't quite find how to get in so he walked all the way around it and then past this huge mountain and took some pictures and then found himself an hour later on the other side of the bridge from his flat.  Needless to say he was lost but he found out how to get back and went to the flat.  He doesn't have a key to the house so he buzzed the place to see if his mom was back yet but she wasn't so he had to wait around for her.  She didn't come so Tyke came down here and has been here for 20 minutes.  He'll go back to the flat after this and hopefully he will be able to get back in soon.  But if not oh well.  This city is really beautiful.  He stays here one more night after tonight and then leaves on Tuesday.  Then he goes to Dover, Calais, and Paris before heading back to London for one more night.  Then he travels all of Sunday and gets back Sunday night in Washington.  So maybe he will see you then but if not, later yo.
