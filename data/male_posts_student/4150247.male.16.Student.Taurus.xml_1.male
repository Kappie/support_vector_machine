Well recently I bought this book from Robert Bruce called  Astral Dynamics: A NEW approach to Out-of-Body experiences.  First of all I always thought there was more 2 life than what we see. I heard 4 a while about astral projection some time ago but b4 it was hard 4 me 2 think that these types of things can happen. However I have read alot of stuff on the Web about astral projection and find it quite intriguing. SO i began my journey tryin 2 find out how to perform an OBE and i ran into  Robert Bruce's book. I read the reviews of some of the people who bought it and they seemed pretty satifisfied wit the book.  SO i bought it.  Well i have read da first section of the book called Elements of Projection. And wat a headache it gave you. DOn't get me wrong it explained it very throughly and i understood it . But wow does it make you askso many questions in ur head. Like especially the Chapter dedeicated to  Mindsplitting.  AGain i understood it but ..O god so many questions! SO i finished the first part and now am about 2 read the second part called New Energy Ways (NEW). I'll keep you posted on dat. ALso if anyone read this book or has actually experienced OBE's and can give me advice i gladly invite you to write.
