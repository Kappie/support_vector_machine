I am  a cheap, dirty bastard .         Anyways,  Homeworld  rocks. The graphics are probably the best I've ever seen on my  Dell . The gameplay is wonderful, camera control is flawless, and the developers actually put some thought into the storyline. I find that I am reminded of  Ender's Game  while watching the action unfold:   "The game was a holographic display, and his fighter was represented only by a tiny light. The enemy was another light of a different color, and they danced and spun and maneuvered through a cube of space that must have been ten meters to a side. The controls were powerful. He could rotate the display in any direction, so he could watch from any angle, and he could move the center so that the duel took place nearer or farther from him..."         The whole experience reminded me heavily of  Homeworld , especially when he began to talk about fleets; however, there isn't a single passage in there devoted entirely to describing the fleets or combat; mostly they're spread out among several paragraphs, so I know what it's like but can't find an excerpt to describe it.    Try eating chocolate chips by the handful; they're purty tasty!
