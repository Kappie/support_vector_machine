(Well yesterday and today)      Well, Mike and Baron had plan to come see me but things didn't work out. Instead they were going to go to Pinellas but that didn't work out either. See Carolyn and Travis told Baron they were going to get Suzie. So Baron decided he wanted to stay to see her I guess so anywho they ended up not going anywhere. Just stayed home and "hung out". Well, they showed up at church in these outfits that sound wierd Baron was sporting a Vintage suit that was pink and green plad and Mike was sporting a Vintage suit that was corduroy. (I think I spelled that right) Some ppl thought they looked good others thought not so good. (I would have been in the 2nd group) After church they went home (Jean's) and changed, then Carolyn, Suzie, Mike and Baron decided they were going to go see "The Little Black Book". Well Mike was paying for Baron so when they went up to the window and asked for the tickets and the chic laughed in their faces. (I would have too) After the movie walking out to the car, a bum got 50 cents off Baron. Mike stayed at Jean's for the night then went home the next morning at around 11 and was pretty tired b/c he didn't go to bed until about 3 so he took a little nap. And that's all folks.....Hope you enjoy knowing what he does everyday!! I bet it's really interesting to ya'll. LoL Well, Nicolina I am sorry that we couldn't come see you and I would have rather gone to see you, maybe sometime soon. I miss you.            Well, as interesting as his life is, my hands are tired from typing so I think I will end here... Did you like the part where they didn't want to come see me? I did, thought it was quite amusing. O yeah I forgot to metion that just know I got to talk to Mike's mom, she seems very nice. And I got to talk to my lil' sis Alyssa, she is so sweet I wish her and Lauren could change places for a while LOL!! But anywho Aloha!!        This is Nee-cole and Mike love ya'll!!        P.S. Aloha means hello and goodbye!!
