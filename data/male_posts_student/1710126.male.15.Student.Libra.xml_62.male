Then saw a 2. Heyz, not bad. Then i started feeling very sad... When i walked home was really like in a daze...juz walking alone, met rich n jason wong who asked for my results. Very sad. But after went swimming and let off some steam felt betta. Parents said results were okay, but i soooo want an A1. nvm. Go for all distinctions lorz lol.  For all those whu got A1 CONGRATS!!! For all whu got A2, if ya happie, then gd fer u, but those whu r sad, cheer up. More than half of singapore is dying to get ur score soget over it. Itz not tt bad. For all whu got an undeserved b3, I m really sry, but give yaself a chance and pick urself up. U DO NOT NEED CHINESE in ur L1R5, so dun b too sad. Whats wrong with taking chi in JC? U have another chance to get A1 so grab it. U'll definitely get it this time, juz continue working hard.
