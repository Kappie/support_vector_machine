I saw it, they saw it and chased it to the tool shed in our back yard. The squirrel made its way safely up the fence and over the top, but that didn't restrain the dogs from running back and forth along the fence like the morons that they are.   I became distracted with something and then looked up just in time to see Hunter's back end disappear beneath the shed. He had used those wonderfully evolved/created/bred paws to dig himself a trench just deep enough to scurry through. Of course he's too stupid to know how to get himself out again. While he was under the shed, the older dog, Reiner, heard noises and thought that he had better investigate – barking like a … well, like a dog. The noises he was hearing were coming from the aforementioned Hunter who was now trying to figure out how to get back out.  The short end to a long story is that I had to shovel a trench deep enough so that I could reach in, grab hold of Hunter and pull him part way through the channel until he could figure out that his freedom was just a belly crawl away.   Back in the house now, the dogs are "grounded." I've taken away their allowance and they can't watch television with their friends after school. I've also erected a make-shift barrier along the bottom of the shed to try to head off a repeat performance of today's excitement. Kids these days!
