How does the world not collapse in on its axis and crush every living being when this is going on daily. I don't fucking get it.  this type of bahavior the type that causes kids to bring guns to school and murder hundreds of people........... Not that I would do that. What's worse is that by posting this, I'm giving the person exactly what they were after!!!! How does one end this damn cycle? Why are we still here if this is always happening. I don't. Fucking. Get it.   I'm writing this at school while the rage is still in me, because if I wait until I get home, I know I wont feel the same. Nonetheless, I do not think it's ok for people to feel this way. To torture others for their entertainment. Where is the glory in that...   What happened to the times where kids had morals? I can see how these people that do these things might grow up and see their faults, but what about all the things that have been done and can't be taken back? What about them?! They don't even realize how many people they can break on a day to day basis.    It's damn lucky for both of us that I am calm person, or we might both be in a lot of trouble and/or injured. --------------------------------------------------------------------------   On another note....     screw it   i forgot what i was going to say
