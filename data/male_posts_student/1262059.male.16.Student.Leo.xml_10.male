Don't feel too badly about the civies and all, I missed the only day I was supposed to get civies because no one told me there was... ^^;;   The anchors looks really good, glad you fixed it all up! Things are definitely looking up *looks up*   Anyhows, busy and interesting month coming... soon there will be International night and the art show to work on. Actually, as a matter of fact, we're working on it right now... let's see: for International Night, we *pointz at self, keane and von* are in charge of the japanese pavilion and we have a bunch of stuff planned. Hopefully they all will work ^^;; As for the art show, the same group of people are going to work on a comic... hopefully that works too!   As for just myself, I'm joining up for badminton... I know for a fact I'm not going to make it, cause I only play for fun... some people there take lessons and go to tournaments!! Ah well, it's the fun that all matters.    ~ Chronos
