I rented  The Exorcist ....which is supposedly one of the scariest movies of all time.  My counselor also recommended  Candyman ...which I also got.  Then to top it all off I rented a scary video game:  Silent Hill 2 ...I played the first one...and it was pretty scary...so i will try this one out...I am gonna watch the movies tonight...man...this is gonna be great...  My mom and sister came back from New York.  My mom said ground zero was very depressing...they call it the "footprint" cause it is so big. They visited the restaurant that is pictured in Seinfeld!!  you know the one they always goto?  They just used the outside for the show tho, not the inside...they obviously used a set for the inside....and my mom got a Seinfeld script, and she got me a shirt that says "New York Police Department".  So that's all cool...  well, I am gonna go scare the piss outta me...scary movies time!!...bye bye  "I think I'm turning japanese, I really think so." -Skankin' Pickle
