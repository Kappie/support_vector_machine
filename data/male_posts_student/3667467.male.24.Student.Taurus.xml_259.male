You can reply to this letter with an "Unsubscribe Me/Stop The Insanity" message. This is also one of those things you can FWD around if you really enjoy it, or go to pub72.ezboard.com/bpublius if you'd like to read back issues.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * AMERI-POS: BE THAT OLD GUY IN THE COMMERCIALS!  Hey, you know those commericals with the guy that buys that Internet Station thingy that probably cost him like $20,000? And every day he goes to it, opens it up, and WOW there's, like, TWENTY bucks worth of $1 bills inside? And that  makes him rich somehow? THAT COULD BE YOU! We here at Ameri-POS have told you for two years now that other people are going to take all the good spots at malls and airports. It's an amazing coincidence that there are spots still left NEAR YOU!    "I want the American Dream, and I want it now!" --Woman from commercial, who forgot the struggle of her immigrant forefathers * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   FREDLINE NEWS: REBELLIOUS CASHIER FEARS FOR WELL-BEING  So this lady walks into the store and wants to buy some coffee. She reaches into her pocket, and somewhere between all the Casino Niagara tokens she finds $1.50 in Canadian money and hands it to me. So I tell her I can't take Canadian money unless she wants to pay the exchange rate, and suddenly I've infringed on her rights as an American. "What do you mean?! Everyone does it!!," to which I reply that yes, they do, in Canada. Now she must See a Manager Immediately. That means I have to go find the manager, who really does have better things to do, and explain why this woman has to interrupt TWO people that don't care two cents for her $1.50 coffee. Then the manager has to do the Happy Customer Dance until the problem goes away.   When I came back, the woman was on the other side of the room, filling up a coffee cup she'd stolen from behind the register. She sees me. "Changed your mind, huh?" So I flip her off. She wasn't very happy.   That night, and for the next day or so, my middle finger became a badge of honor. For the few people at work that I told (you have to be careful what gets out) it helped relieve some work tension. It was a fun little story to tell friends and family. ("And then I did THIS, Mom!") But then the thoughts started creeping in. What if I've gone on a power trip, and start telling off customers every day? More importantly, what if she comes back? With her larger, angrier boyfriend? Uh-oh. I had to watch my back. This is what I get for not loving my neighboUr!   Next week, she did come back, and her boyfriend/husband/brother was there, too. It was a particularly busy lunch period, so it was easy to pretend I didn't recognize her and look occupied. As I said "Thanks" to her as I did any other customer, she responded with a noticeably sharp "Thank YOU!!" in return.   So my fears were not entirely baseless. In conclusion, don't flip people off, unless you know them personally. You never know when they'll show up again. And they'll show up with their mullet-headed, dumbfounded, trailer-hick redneck stringbean of a husband/brother/probably both to stare at you awkwardly for a couple minutes.   I hope she's not reading this.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FOUR HAIKU  (found amongst my notes from a conference last year)   Oh, the Renaissance. Pictures and statues abound. Italians do work!   Dr. McDonnell. Stumbles, speaking, long pauses. Weekend-old coffee.   Canadians here? The vermin lift up their hands, Gap-toothed from hockey.

In June we declared the FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette of the Month to be Maria Bartiromo of CNBC. You can see hot, steamy pictures of her sitting at a desk at www.framisdave.com/avemaria.htm. "Daniel J." who runs the site, also wrote a wonderful dedication poem named "Ave Maria." Thanks for writing, Joe! You're creepy.   Stay tuned for the next issue, when we crown the FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette of July and expose the unheard-of evils of our rival publication, EDLINE NEWS.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * LONG INTERNET CONVERSATION (You can stop reading now)   TomServo0: guess who driving to chicago with me and my brother?  roi058: joe  roi058: lenny  roi058: hannah  roi058: micah  roi058: jerry  roi058: tony  roi058: richard  roi058: mustaffa  roi058: duffy  roi058: derrick  roi058: dosteovesky  roi058: thoreau  roi058: dr. butler  roi058: gerri pawalek  roi058: damien  roi058: some of joe's HIV friendster hoes  roi058: michael jackson  roi058: drew bledsoe  roi058: dave  roi058: dave  roi058: dave's dad  roi058: richard allen  roi058: osama bin laden  roi058: saddam huissein  roi058: tommy franks  roi058: wesley clark  roi058: howard dean  roi058: george bush, senior  roi058: jeb  roi058: jethro tull  roi058: john mccenroe  roi058: tom arnold  roi058: david letterman  roi058: an elephant trainer  roi058: a lion tamer  roi058: a real estate agent  roi058: a tops manager  roi058: susie liddle  roi058: mary echter  roi058: mike lauria  roi058: jack kerouac's ashes  roi058: tim allen  roi058: dick van dyke  roi058: a motorcycle dyke  roi058: beck  roi058: lisa loeb  roi058: danko jones  TomServo0: warmer  roi058: david guterson  roi058: tim o'brien  roi058: ani difranco  roi058: natalie merchant  roi058: bjork  roi058: mick cochrane  roi058: father cooke  roi058: joe's grandma  roi058: thurman thomas  roi058: hillary clinton  roi058: an antelope herder  roi058: jesus christ  roi058: your mom  roi058: dr. rosenbloom  roi058: dr. jones  roi058: pete martin  roi058: catherine sicoli  roi058: dr. d'amico  roi058: jack kevorikian  roi058: bernard slepian's widow  TomServo0: should i just tell you, or are you having too much fun?  roi058: zack  roi058: mario lopez  roi058: steve irwin  roi058: bob graham  roi058: tim russert  roi058: charity vogel  roi058: megan herbeck  roi058: give me 5 more guesses........................  roi058: james lipton  roi058: charlie rose  roi058: oprah  roi058: kevin o'connell  roi058: jane cary  roi058: ok, you can tell me  TomServo0: mike slagor  roi058: i was so close  TomServo0: how you missed that is beyond me  TomServo0: i think you just re-took the 2000 census  roi058: i wanted to name 5 million people  roi058: but i don't really have the time  roi058: al sharpton, al gore, alphonse d'amato, alec baldwin...  roi058: brett boone, barry bonds, barry bostwick, bernie kosar, and bump Andgo  roi058: corbin lacina, jimmy carter, catcher in the ryle, toni morrison, and ray romano  roi058: bob evans, jimmy dean, kenny rogers, bob dylan, and michael moore  roi058: michael douglass, michael richards, richard michaels, al michaels, and dick n. anus  roi058: apricot, orange, cherry, banana, tomato, grape, and apple  roi058: lemon, lime, peach, pear, and cranberry  roi058: ibm, dell, gateway, apple, toshiba, hp, sony, compaq, winbook  roi058: jazz, soft rock, adult contemporary . . . .
