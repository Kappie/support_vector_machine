It made me want to go to Japan just to see some of the places they show in the movie, although meeting someone like Johansson would be a definite plus as well :X.  Bill Murray was hilarious as usual, and Johansson was pretty good too.  The whole movie has a dreamlike atmosphere that is just amazing.  It just goes to show how two confused people, stuck in a strange place, can form a bond that transcends barriers that most people seem boxed in by.  They seemed so comfortable in each others' company.      Then again, if I was sharing a bed with someone as beautiful as Scarlett Johansson I would be pretty comfortable too.      The ending is really good and kept the film from being predictable.   Go see it.
