And when people dine out, they typically swallow more calories than when they eat at home. Women who eat out more than five times a week consume nearly 300 more calories per day than women who eat out less often. Children consume almost double the 440 calories they usually eat in a home-cooked meal.  I have no sympathy for people who can spend money eating out and then complain about gaining weight.  Now playing:  The Clash  - I'm Not Down  I was surfing  urlLink xanga  earlier, and I was reminded about how I generally don't have much in common with lots of the Asian-Americans at Binghamton. Many of them are just so... AZN. That's a subculture that I just don't really have any connection to. I don't listen to the music, I don't dress the fashion, or care about the same things. It's no wonder that when go to TASC stuff, I feel so out of place.  Now Playing:  Bad Religion  - Stranger Than Fiction  I didn't go out to hang with some people, because my health isn't 100% and I was tired from work. I needed a day of rest.  ***
