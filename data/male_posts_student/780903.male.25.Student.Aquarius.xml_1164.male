Well, until Monday, when I start my summer gig, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here... still got to figure out what section 1045 recapture means.  As I was walking over to pick up the exam this morning -- 8:30 this morning -- I passed about eight or ten different people, also on their way to get exams, all drinking Starbucks Frappucinos.  At 8:30 in the morning.  With the whip cream and caramel syrup and everything.  Caffeinated breakfast of champions I guess.  I had an Odwalla Carrot/Apple/Orange juice, which is awfully tasty, and a donut, which wasn't so much.  That was my entire intake until I gave in the exam and went to grab a sandwich.  At 10:30, 2 hours in, the fire alarm in my building went off.  Again.  (It went off last night too.)  So I went to the library for the rest of the exam and did it there.  Didn't notice much of a difference.  8-hour exams aren't any fun no matter where you take them.   Top Eleven Beverages of Choice (although not my choice) Preceding An 8-Hour-Exam   1.
