I want to just re-arrange my room to make space on the shelves, so I can store decent stuff on it.  I really am the most spur of the moment type of guy though.  I guess, this rush is in response to not getting into AP Spanish, actually, I'm on the waiting list.  Speaking of which, it was really funny today in Spanish.  Laura runs in and was like "Senora! Senora! You estoy en AP!!!" and Mrs. Lawrence was like "Laura, es 'soy'!" and she started to laugh, it was pretty funny, considering how excited Laura was.   Okay, I better stop writting and eat something.  I'm pretty hungry.
