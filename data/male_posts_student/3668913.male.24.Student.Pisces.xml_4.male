Gossip is one of the vilest poison that the devil has in his arsenal. Many times, it comes disguised in the form of innocent questions, and perhaps, "CONCERN" is quoted as the pretext of its existence. But make no mistakes about it, it is really a form of poison that corrupt the innermost of a person over time, changing faith into cynicism and negativeness. More often than not, I have seen many friendships broken through gossip, even in church. Members have left because of hurts caused by gossip from other people. Many times, even if rumours about certain people were justified, gossip often prevent them from making a full recovery from whatever mistakes they have made. They simply give up.   There is no excuse for gossip to exist at all. In short, always remember, what one sow, one shall reap.
