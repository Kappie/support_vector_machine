FUN. then, after an intense scratching of the back, and a yawnfest, i got out of bed and ate some cereal, which im still convinced was poisoned. its very slow acting. some of my colleagues from the effigy films movie production company have concocted an idea...nacho cheese chugfest! isnt that splendid? wed have a ref (yours truly), two chuggers, two clowns as entertainers, and an announcerman...john and eriks idea, fun eh?   i went to eriks house last weekend...and, unfortunately, broke his bed.   if you must know, i was NOT, contrary to popular belief, POLE DANCING, but i was swinging on his bedpost. yes...well details were withheld, and izzy was not available for comment friday.   anyhoo fun stuff, i hope this blog will go places. like new zealand n stuff. so syonara until like tomoroowwwwww....
