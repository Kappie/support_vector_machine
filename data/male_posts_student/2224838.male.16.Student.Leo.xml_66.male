He is amusing, and I am happy for him, but the public is just making a big joke of him now.  Think of the gimmicks that  American Idol  must use that lead to things like this. They must purposely let a few "bad acts" slip through the preliminary auditions just to have some people that their judges can make fun of on the show. Otherwise, people like William Hung would not make it on the show in the first place. This is probably the reason that I avoid watching the show. That, and the fact that I just don't care who wins.   Anyway, whatever happens with his career, I just hope that William Hung doesn't allow himself to become a big joke to all of the people trying to make money off of him because he actually seems genuine and innocent.
