Ya, sooo they made a band called SMK, stands for Shu Mai Kids...ya kinda lame i know.. well then these guys were just kinda "posing" cos Chao (the taiwanese guy, with the Les Paul) doesnt know how to sing. Hajime (the jap) just started learning drums, and he's quite good, i'm sure that with some practice he'll manage to be as good as Travis Barker! (I wish...) Then Gap, the jap (he's thai but i call him "the jap" cos it rhymes with "gap") is a hell of a fan of neo and emo bands (Funeral for a friend, lost prophets, papa roach, linkin park, pod, story of the year, hoobastank, deftones...). Young Keun, (the korean, with the bass) is korean, and he has a bass....uh right. Ya so Young Keun, and Gap are both gone now, so next I am gonna play be the guitar-vocals guy. And I'll so be with Hajime and Chao. I'll have to find a new name for the band; i'm the only one who speaks english here!     Here they jump...    Here they dont jump..keke
