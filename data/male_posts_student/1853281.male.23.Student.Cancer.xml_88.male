Plotted out a diet plan....hope it works, hope i can stick to it. Big part of it is not guzzling so much beer....realized that i really should not be gaining except for the beer...maybe i should stick to wine and spirits...or budget the beer calories...I'll have to think about it someone end the bus strike darlings, do please. devin
