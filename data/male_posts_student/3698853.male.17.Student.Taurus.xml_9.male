We decided to stick it out until we thought it wouldn't clear up. It didn't. But I  did  start a new sketch. Slowly, I've been picking away at drawing these characters for a story I'm writing (I hesitate to say "book" or "novel," because that would mean I knew what I was doing), and slowly but surely, I've had about six done by now. This one will be the seventh out of an approximate twenty or so characters (main and secondary), not including costume changes. This specific character "Kyron" is the first whole male I'll have drawn seriously. I am so terrible with the male figure. You thought my females were bad... oh man. lol. Anyways, I'm working on him and am currently stuck on what I should have him wear. He was originally slated to be wearing a suit, but that entire character design went to another character. Then I had him as a doctor; so I tried to think of a doctor's uniform. That didn't work. I got so desperate, I started looking to my REALLY old character designs. I managed to resist, but one was really tempting me. Now I'm thinking of placing him in some street clothes, maybe shorts, shoes, t-shirt deal? Who knows. I finally got his face down though. That had been a major barrier before. Wow, it's already 8:30PM >_ _So after the beach, we went to Applebee's. Omg, I luv their food. lol. (apologies for the consistent use of the internet-isms). Then, we went to Toys R Us, because my dad is crazy. I got to catch up with the video game world for once in the life. The last game I played was Suikoden III, last X-mas or summer?. Too bad about that, I truly think video games drive my imagination. We came home, and washed the cars. It's always been a weird family tradition. I guess we used to wash our own cars a lot when we were poorer, and the habit just stuck. *shrugs* _I've missed the past few days of exercise. Not good. I'm going to start up again tonight and tomorrow. I think I actually tanned a lil at the beach :D. Now, I have to try and think of something interesting from my day to focus on like the blogs before.... *rocks back and forth* _I give up. I guess this entry will be a lot shorter than its predecessors, huh? Now for the title... Not a really interesting day. [Edit: Okay, I guess since the day wasn't over yet I couldn't rule out the chance for inspiration. Anyways, I went to heat up some leftovers for dinner and checked to see if the rice was still good... It was not. OMG! I hate the rank and rancid smell of spoiled rice Yyyyuck! It's like Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon opening up Pharoah Tutankhamen's tomb (>,
