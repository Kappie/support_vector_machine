I am MOVING, and it's actually a reality!  I think it hit me when I was going over the criteria on the phone with the realtor... and looking at a map of the RedLine train in Chicago and listing the stops I want to be close to.  Suddenly I was like "holy SHIT, I'm moving there..."  I can't tell you how excited I am!  I think it's just weird to think that things you want can actually be achieved, go figure?!  There have been far too many coincidences with Chicago and me for a while and speaking of the realtor, I think I will share the story of how I came across good ole' Kent V.  One day a few months back I got on several different real estate websites to search for condos in various places I was applying to law school.  Naturally one of the places I wanted to compare costs of living in was Chicago.  As with many websites of that nature, my contact information was required before I was able to hit the search page.  I was somewhat annoyed, but I wanted to see the listings, so I put in my real e-mail address (which is odd, because usually I just put in some fake address like "mason@mason.net").  For my phone number I think I put in (405)555-1234 or something equally clever.  Anyhow, long story longer, I get an e-mail from this Kent fellow a couple of days later telling me he was happy to help if I needed any assistance with real estate, etc.  Seeing as how someone took the time to write me and not send the typical automated form e-mail back, I felt it appropriate to write back and let him know I was no where close to being in the market for making a condo purchase, but to thank him for his time.  I explained to him that I was just simply comparing prices in different cities that I might be moving to in the coming 6 months.  He wrote back telling me that he recognized the 405 area code on the information section I filled out and that he was a Univ. Of Oklahoma graduate (hey... like ME soon), also that when he graduated from OU his desire was to move to Chicago at any cost and just up and did it during the "dot-com" craze.  I wrote back because I was obviously impressed by the coincidence.  I told him I was currently a student at OU (something I hadn't explained originally), and that I, too, wanted to live in Chicago so badly.  He has since been in contact off and on to see how my law school search is going and what information I have found out.  He even is setting up a search for me (as I think I explained a couple posts back) in order to make my search easy once I go to find a place to live, and to give me an idea of what I can get, in what areas, and for what price.  Maybe the coincidence isn't weird to anyone else, but to me it's strange.  Of all webpages I browsed, I get in contact with someone who graduated from OU, applied to grad schools but specifically wanted to live in Chicago, etc.  Thanks KENT!  You're being so helpful.  I'm feeling 100 times better today, and the sickness is finally subsiding.  Talk about RALLY, I've been rallying all day.  I hit up the dentist, got the tooth all checked out that has been bugging me, went to the bank to get a money order to put a deposit in to hold a seat @ law school for the fall, got myself a cherry coke and headed home.  These are all menial tasks, yes, but considering I haven't left the house in days due to my minor illness, it was huge.  My mom was talking to me today about some sort of program she saw on the bible code, and how there are all kinds of codes written within the text of the original bible translation.  There was even some jumble about "twin towers" and "airplanes" and "flames" or some shit.  OKAY code people.. why don't you go ahead and find this shit out BEFORE hand, hmm?  I posed this question to her, and she said that they did touch on the issue during the program.  Stating that something was being found now about a meteor or some sort destroying Earth.  I was like "oh great" and she said "but then there was something..." and before she could finish I said "about Ben Aflek and Bruce Willis flying up on a rocket and breaking it apart first??"  She didn't think I was very funny because I wasn't taking her story seriously.  I was amused though.  Weren't you?  Apparently there is some code listing thing about how it could possibly be broken up before it hits Earth.  What is this, a Choose Your Own Adventure book?  I like the bible and believe it's teachings, but I'm kind of confused about the between the lines stuff and codings and what gets lost in translation from Hebrew to English to Spanish to German and then to Pig Latin and back to English.  I think I will try not to get too far into thinking about that, and instead try to just go on living the best I can with the best moral standards I know how:)  She also was describing to me one part of the program that had a rabbi and a Priest and a Minister or something and I said "and they all went into a bar.. and??"  She didn't like that either.  It was fun!   I'm going to class now, well soon I am.  First I'm getting me a PHAT grilled cheese at Classic 50's.  Watch out for the Meteor guys.. and if it hits us and we all go down in a bible code sorta way.. Don't say that ALL the signs weren't there!  C'mon.
