We couldnt find the right type of ink for the printer cuz we have to get each color (cyan, light cyan, black, magenta, light magenta, and yellow) and they only had light magenta. so my mom just decided to get the keyboard and mouse. i finally have a optical mouse instead of that damn trackball mouse. then after that, she decided to go to dinner, at this place called sunset over in glen burnie, and i hate that place so i wanted to go home, my mom gave me a 20 to order a pizza with. ^_^ like 20 mins after i got home, i install the keyboard and mouse and decided to order the pizza from domino's. i ordered a large pepperoni, sausage, and ham thin crust (oh yea im healthy *sarcasm* it took like 15 mins for the pizza to come when the dude said it would be 45 mins, he lied to me.i should get 5 bucks back for that >>', it took an hr and an half for me to finish off the pizza, cuz the phone kept ringing, damnit and after that i just chilled around the house. around 10:30 my mom came back, she went to the store and got those mini little bottles of dasani (sp?) waters, which is awesome, to me atleast lol. and yea thats pretty much how my day went.
