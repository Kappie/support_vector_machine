For the past three years' national day celebration, i have been helping out in setting up the stores and misses all three concert so far... And since we don't need to be involved in the fund raising, this gives me an opportunity to have fun...  Hope tomorrow there won't be any one to dampen my mood to enjoy the celebrations... Breadcrumps, please stay away from me!  Yes... That's all i've got to say... Due to the fact that i need to turn in early as i'm not feeling very well... Yes... Take care people...  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "... from now on, i don't care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die, i'm chucking them in the bin where they belong." - Ron  Love Louis
