It lets you create an offer for an invitation to G-mail, which are extremely hard to come by (but not in this case). Hell, I made an offer of nothing, and I still got an invite from this wonderful fellow.  Although not as flashy as Hotmail, G-Mail still owns everything. I mean, you can Google ( Google  - v. - to search for with Google) your mail. I don't think I need to elaborate on that. Your conversations are automatically organized into easy-to-read sections when you open any part of them. But those aren't even the best part. You get 1 Gigabyte of storage. Yes. One Gigabyte.  In short, G-Mail > H0tmale nd y@huu 2 tha infiatae!1!!11!! And as soon as I get my invites, I may consider giving them away to a few select people.  Accounts promised to (so far): MegaWes  In fact, Wes is going to be a member of this Blog. So don't be alarmed about somebody else posting.  In other news, I got $35 today. Hopefully I'll have  Deities and Demigods  and the  Epic Level Handbook  ordered by next week. And I definitely need to get working on my D Campaign.
