Monday - Off Tuesday - Off Wednesday - 12-4 Thursday - 5-Closing Friday - 5-Closing Saturday - Off Sunday - 10-4  Now these hours are for the Blue Fin; I have told Gary at Olivias I can work there on Wednesday and Saturday nights, so he'll probably have me working all of those nights. So Mondays and Tuesdays are the only days I definitally have off since the Blue Fin is closed those days. Closing time sepends of when I finish and could be any time after ten or as early as nine if I'm realy lucky but is usually about ten thirty.
