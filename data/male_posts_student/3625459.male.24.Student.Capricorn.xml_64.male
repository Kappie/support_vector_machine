We have over 3000 applicants for this position, so you were veryfortunate to have been selected."     I wish I could tell you how unhappy I am, letting that offer go, but I can’t work from home. Not in India where wont get the tools I need (maybe that’s untrue).. The truth is, I wanted to work in LA, even if that meant without pay. I’m not doing it for the money ... well I don’t have anything to work for (that’s a lie. I do try and work towards something, someone)… Anywhere just to be closer to her (if ever there is such a thing called closeness) David, the job didn’t matter it was supposed to be a means to an end. Its unpaid and I cant get to work where I wanted to. Its a boolean AND situation, i was execting a boolean OR .If one OR the other, i;d have chosen it. My only regret is that im soon gonna be further away from her than I want to.  Sent her an email with my permanent address, people loose in touch. Maybe I just want her to send me a letter that’s all. I mean who cares about me. Monique said that she wanted to meet me … she hardly knows me. We barely know each other.  Lisa keeps going on and on about how she’s gonna visit India. I didn’t even bother telling her that she can visit me.  Mum want me to come back to the UK in October, I’m not so sure that I want to. I always end up at the wrong place at the wrong time; say the wrong things at the wrong moment.  I’ve been reading JP’s blog. It looks like he’s settled into a normal life. I don’t know if I’d wanna speak to him. I mean he doesn’t care, who does?  Paula said “ if you are counting on another person to make you happy then it never will be ” I guess I’m still wishing for some one to come and save me.  I guess I’d have lived my life if I do the following 1. Haul my lazy ass to Canada 2. Figure out how to snowboard 3. Get mum to Canada 4. Send my sister a return ticket to any destination in the whole world of her choice (I think she’d want to go someplace in the US of A) 5. Run a mile w/o getting tired 6. Own an X-Box, PS2 and a Game Cube. 7. Do something for the environment (um I could kill myself in the woods, that way I can be useful as manure =)) 8. Meet a whole lotta people whom I’ve spoken to online. 9. Have a whole load of good friends.  [PS if I can achieve all that in 2 years. I can die by the age of 26]
