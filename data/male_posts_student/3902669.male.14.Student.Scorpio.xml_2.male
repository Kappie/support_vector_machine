I just had to cancel with Jess and the crew. If I had gone, I would have probably puked in the water, or my nose would of got so clogged up that I would die of suffocation. I wonder if the crew even went. Today wasn't the best day to go. This cold thing is not cool. For example, yesterday I was going to go to Christ Church with Ryan and Chad, but Ryan got worse (so did I) so we couldn't go. Sometimes I feel like the Christ Church youth group is one big cult. Last time I went with Ryan and Felix, and all the kids looked brainwashed. The 'headmaster' came up to me and asked for my name. When I did, everyone turned around and said a big 'HELLLLLO Bryan'. That was a tad freaky. And then of course, theres the singing. God, I didn't know how long I could stand that monotone singing of theirs. Well that's just an opinion. The Warped Tour is going to be awesome this year!! Although I still haven't bought my tickets yet =( It is on the same day as the Black Belt Extravaganza [July 31st], which I was invited to by Mrs. LaVallee herself. I'm still sort of debating whether I should go or not, or whether I will even have enough time to make it. It just happens to be on the bestest concert of the year, which I wouldn't miss for the world. It should be interesting to see how everyone reacts by me returning. I'm not sure if they'll be open arms or just pure assholes. You never know with the LaVallees..I have to take another pill of that Sudafed crap. Peace I'm out.
