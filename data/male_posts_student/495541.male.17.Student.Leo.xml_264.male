I get in the mode where I don't want to say anything because I'm afraid it doesn't accuratly summarize my thoughts.  So I'll be sitting here, like I am now just thinking and wondering about things.  Do I feel weird?  Well then I think what does weird mean?  Who decides this stuff anyways?  Then if I say I feel weird, you read it and maybe get a completely different idea of what I thought when I said weird.  It's crazy... but this is the sort of thing that keeps me from these long entries.  Weird I know but... I am weird.  In other news, there is no other news.  You get what I mean.  For all of you who were waiting for me to post some pictures... here you go...  I present you... Michael's Photographs (Edit: Link No Longer Works Due To Update!).  Enjoy... I hope.  But yes, this is the new year.  I will be putting up a new design.  It seems like I do this way too much.  I need to go to bed.  Tomorrow is the beginning of school for the new year.  I don't remember my locker combination.  Cool.
