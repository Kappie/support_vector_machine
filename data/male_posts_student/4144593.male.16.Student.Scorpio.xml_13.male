Always thought i was good at using the com.... just found out today my html skills was not tt good after all. Got a problem with the links part. Hiyah too long nv design webpage liao forgot all the commands. But nvm since all our frens lists are like similar edmund (hehehehe) u noe wat to do hor .... just copy the source n then send mi.I will add my own fren's links myself.         Woke up late this morning, did it on purpose; wanted to skip first part of the stupid lesson. I actually planned not even to come to school today but the guyz seemed intent on going bowling so i just came along. Reach the bus stop only to see my bus ran away ..... not so stupid as to chase it since i planned to be late -wahahahahahahha-. Waited for a very short while then another bus came so i hopped on. At the bus stop after mine fadhil came onto the bus. He saw mi n sit next to mi. We chatted a while bout my personal problems n i felt much better after talking to him. After a while Leon(tt guy from our orientation with the lame jokes) came on and he identify fadhil n i so he came to chat with us, talked bout life in sch, stuff going on in SCL, how the MB ppl cut their mouse, movies , pool, bowling and generally life. Then while we alighted at the bus stop near the sch, we started tokin bout tt stupid YapB.T n how gay he iz. We were laughing like hell bout it.  Plough through 2 hours was crappy S.P in which i slept half the time n spent the next half tokin. Went FJ next to have breakfast. Ordered mixed vegetable rice n rocky mountain. Ate less than half of the rocky mountain cuz i'm too full. Weian n sean were complain bout how mi n wee leong r wasteful. Did not really catch wat they were saying cuz i was looking around the place 4 her just in case she's around. Had my swelter hood prepared just in case she's around. Went to play badminton next, Walked there n then back again cuz i did not bring my pass. In the end had to borrow ya ling's pass to enter the sports hall. Played badminton with the guyz... had so much fun making a fool of sean n wee leong by making them run all the around the court to chase my shots *lol*. Then siyan the pro had to break up the fun. He told them my weakness n then i started losing. Weeleong and sean just won't let mi rest as they said they wanted revenge. I guess wat goes around cums around.  Went bowling next. The first set every1 was like bowl for fun. The second set then every1 started gettin serious (well actually every1 but mi). Not really in the mood to bowl so i just any how throw. Then tt said the loser has to strip so i got serious in the last set in order to catch up. In the last set i finally got serious n well i got back my normal standard.I got 4 strikes n then every1 was shifting their attention on weeleong cuz now he got the lowest score. I extended my lead by bout 20 . I got caught up in the wee leong thing n then i started bowling like crap again. Making funny shots and stupid actions. But omg i can't believe it man Weeleong Caught up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the last 2 bowls he suddenly on form!!!!!!!!!! I started to panic n then my throws became worse. In the end overall i still got last. Think i lost to weeleong by 4 points overall. I Can't believe even now man.   After tt we went to eat n then play pool. Not in the mood to play so i just any how shoot.... Luckily i didn;t got trashed. Whoa i now then noe i so pro sia anyhow shoot oso can win other ppl. LOL Went home after tt. Had a good sleep and then now here i n complain bout life.......  Note: EVERY1  Plz do not tell tt irritating VERIN bout this blog i change blog just in case she noes my last blog..... SO DUN TELL HER!!!!!!! _____________________________________________________________________________________  Fadhil- thx a lot !!!!
