Panama does not feel like a country in Central America.   To Jim, Panama did not evoke images of ¨Indians¨ in Guatemala or Honduras.   Panama City might not be the Paris of Latin America, but it has its elegance and its place in the world.  It seemed distinct from what Jim imagined a Tegucigalpa being like: dull, morose, mud brown, and deforested.  People here love guayaberas and have the salt and pepper hair of mulattos.  A bit like in Cuba?       "Everywhere there are Colombians, escaping the ravages of an interminable guerrilla war in their country, which ultimately has reached the most cynical proportions.  The FARC no longer fight in the name of a Marxist revolution, just cocaine.  The paramilitaries terrorize and butcher.¨"  Yesterday, in the Panamanian newspaper, Jim read that the Colombian President, Alvaro Uribe, had been named a decade ago in a secret U.S. Department of Defense intelligence paper as a close ally of Pablo Escobar´s Medellin cartel.  "But Uribe is a hardliner.  They won´t suspend his visa like they did Ernesto Samper´s."      What does it mean to be Panamanian?  A man (or woman) of the isthmus?      Jim bought a guayabera to find out.  He could have also purchased a flag: of stars and bars arranged diagonally, with red and blue colors.  He talked with people in restaurants and taxi drivers.  Most seemed to tell him that Mireya Moscoso, the current president of the Republic, will not be missed because she has mismanaged the country.  There were allegations of corruption.      "The lesson is....don´t elect a woman!" laughed a Panamanian businessman of Chinese origin at a swanky restaurant.  He was joking and having a beer with a young visitor from Miami, of Nicaraguan extraction.      Many looked to the forthcoming inauguration of Martin Torrijos, son of the famous strongman Omar Torrijos, who died in an airplane crash under suspicious circumstances and was succeeded by Manuel Antonio Noriega, with some measure of satisfaction.  But it was the satisfaction or resignation of poor people, who expect little from a Latin American government:      "You have to have the right last name to get one of these jobs,¨ Norberto, a taxi driver, explained as he contemplated the Canal workers at the touristed Miraflores Locks.  ¨A last name like Arias.¨  (Arias, as in Arnulfo Arias, the fascistic leader who allied Panama with Nazi Germany during World War II.  Arias the strong man, the President of the United Fruit Company Republic, whose name reminds me of a similarly titled poem by Pablo Neruda in his Canto General.)  The jobs at the Canal are coveted because the wages in the Zone cannot be lowered, by stipulation of the treaty signed by Jimmy Carter (whom Jim admired greatly) and Torrijos.   But you´ve got to have connections!    ¨My last name is Guerrero.¨         ¨The Americans were not saints.  They did things that were bad.  They would find young women at bars, who would look into their blue eyes and say that ´this man is the object of my destiny´, and fuck them, and then leave them by the side of the road.  But every Panamanian misses the Americans now that they are gone.  They taught us to work hard, and in exchange they paid you well, so that you always had money in your pocket and ate well."
