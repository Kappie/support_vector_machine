Fortunately, I did a search on the internet later last night and discovered that it wasn't simply random musing. Turns out that Halo 2 has a bizarre online advertising program; not just a simple "buy this product because it is good" thing, though. A quality, creative advertising campaign, that's blurring the lines between reality and fiction.  This is creative; not just reciting old thoughts, inventing new ones.  This advertising campaign is reminiscent of that "hacker" scenario in the "Enter the Matrix" videogame; remember that? Cool, while it lasted; but it didn't last very long. This "I love Bees" thing has more literary references than a dozen libraries, and stranger computer dialogue than... well, actually, it's about on a par with  urlLink Marathon , the primary Bungie game, which introduced the deranged AI's of Durandal and Tycho. Seems they've realised they're onto a good thing, with the confusing cryptic technobabble. Rock on, Bungie. Rock on.
