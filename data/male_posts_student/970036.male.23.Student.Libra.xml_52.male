Through our analysis we have noticed that the level of activity on your Internet account is more than 30 to 50 times that of our average Internet user.   We would like to help identify the cause(s) of the heavy traffic that may be affecting your computer’s performance and most importantly your Internet experience. Often a file sharing program can be the cause of high amounts of traffic. Not only will this affect the flow of traffic on the Internet it also puts a major strain on your computer’s resources.

Internet Assistance Team SHAW) Internet Services   I was touched to see that they were so concerned with my computer's performance and the quality of my online experience. Well, my  unlimited  high-speed account couldn't be better, and between streaming internet radio through  urlLink iTunes , downloading music, movies, and TV shows, and even playing a few online games like UT2K4, I'd say that I'm making the most of what high-speed has to offer!  Only 30 to 50 times that of the average user!? That's almost insulting! I shall strive evermore to increase those statistics, so help me God.
