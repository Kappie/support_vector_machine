Amira came home last night and the whole time was one big grin and :-D I remember all the fun we had together before she left, and she's been pushing me to go to UCSC, so maaybe I will. Classes today were 25 minutes long, which was quite alright. Chem: More extra credit Math: Test ELECTIONS-was alright...I looked for Kaya, but I couldn't find her. French: grrrrrrr History: Carlin,  AGAIN  English: Finished Harvey, next is Inherit the Wind.  After english John came up to me, and he's totally instigating a friendship....super exciting.  We are gopnna go longboarding sometime....he's probably pro though, so I'm not sure I can live up to the expectations...but who cares, right?  Kaya is going to Japan....sounds like so much fun. I need to get her address before she goes....cuz I gotta write.  I'm purdy tired. Gonna go to guitar today.  I hope acupunctre was okay kaya.  ~Elan
