There was also one page where you could download a text file, but I'll try to re-find it tomorrow.   PS- I tried to find a club for people who didn't understand anything about  Pi , but the best I got was a webpage for people who couldn't remember 2 digits of  Pi  =-P Unfortunate for you, he quite updating the list long ago because "it felt more like a chore than fun" Off to bed I go now.
