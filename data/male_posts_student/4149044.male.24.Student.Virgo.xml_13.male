Surprised the hell out of me considering a) I was tired as hell, and b) the gym had no power whatsoever (no lights, no a/c, nothing). I was sweating like a bitch and dragging my feet to and from the water fountain every few minutes, but holy shit I pushed those 100lb dumbbells on incline as if they were nothing at all. I wish the gym had heavier weights. Also blasted delts and calves..good times. Tomorrow I plan on working back and traps before my 12pm flight. Gotta burn as many cals as possible before my three-day bingefest ya know?      Still haven't packed and still haven't gone to Target. Still don't know what to do with Bitsy either. Grace should be here in a bit. I think we're going to head over to Stonebriar for some last-minute shopping, and then finally stop at Super Target on the way back. Damn I'm hungry. Tried to go to Buca yesterday but soon realized it wasn't open for lunch on weekdays. Dammit. Maybe we'll go there tonight. I'm seriously craving their margarita pizza and jumbo meatballs. Ok time to shower.
