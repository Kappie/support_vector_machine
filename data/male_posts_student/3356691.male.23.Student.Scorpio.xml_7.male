They were short of food, equipment, ammunition, and even lacked winter clothing. So two days before the Christmas of that year, which I think is 1944, General Mcauliffe received a letter from the German Commander demanding the 101st's honorable surrender, the only way Germans offered to save the USA encircled troops from total annihilation. Guess what, the German Commander got the following reply, "To the German Commander,  NUTs !" On December 26, General Patton's Third Army broke through the German lines, allowing supplies to flow in and the wounded to be evacuated. But no member of the 101st has ever agreed that the division needed to be rescued.
