In the Matrix, Neo takes the RED pill to exit the matrix. I was arguing about this with Paul one day, and, along came Dominic and, because he fancies Paul, agreed with him. HE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN THE F**KING MATRIX!!!!!!!! This really makes my blood boil. If I were prime Minister, I would outlaw homosexuality, outlaw this qstupid theory everyones got. I will make my views clear...  A GOOD WINNER IS BULLS**T. AS IS A GOOD LOSER. PEOPLE WIN THINGS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE P**S FROMN THE OTHER TEAM. WE WON WE WON WE WON. BAD LOSERS!
