My desktop is a 4 and a half years old HP pavillon that is running windows 98, and it has been my trusty friend requiring almost no maintenance and doing everything I have asked it to do (after some initial problems trying to convince it that it isn't ok to spontaneously shut down).   But lately it has some problems shutting down (it freezes during shutdown) and when I do get it shut down, it makes these strange sounds and spins all its drives and stuff in the middle of the night, as if it is haunted (see  urlLink this  post). And I really want to get a Mac.  I like the idea that they have been designed as if someone is actually going to use them.  They are pretty.  they are supposed to be more stable than windows.  I also like the idea of not using microsoft products.  it makes me feel like a rebel of sorts.  like luke skywalker.  he would have used a mac.  but han solo probably would have used a pc that he stripped down and customized.   anyway. I have always been a windows luser ever since i switched from the commodore 64.  and the whole mac thing is a little scary for me.  and now blogger is offering some sort of way to post photos to your blog via IM along with unlimited photo hosting.  but only if you use windows.   so any mac users out there, please convince me.  tell me that the mac is way better, even though there are lots of cool things that are only offered for windows machines (like  urlLink movielink  which I have been using on my old HP with no problems), tell me that the battery life is better on a mac, tell me that I will be a better person if i use a mac, tell me I will smile every time I turn it on, tell me it will make me smarter and more attractive.
