And now to religion. Religion is tricky, you see, because every religion is vowing for the "my dick is bigger than your dick, you are infidels" mantra. it just isn't the case. if there is a god, why would he create an exclusive religion that isn't possible for all faiths to follow. most faiths are reflective on their regions. you don't see a lot of muslims in the northern regions of the world, islam just isn't conducive to anywhere else. region affects religion as well as religion affects region. to those of you who think you belong to the superior religion, i'm sorry, but there isn't one. there is a massive disparity between those who believe and those who don't. those who believe feel that they are happier individuals, which in all likelihood, they are not. those agnostics, myself included, are viewed to be sad, mordant people, which we aren't. i'm one of the happier people i know, happier than all of my faith-filled friends. so what does that have to say about your logic? if there was a god, i think he wouldn't care what religion you belonged to as long as you cared for each other, as long as there was love in the world, he wouldn't give a shit if you were christian or hindu or janist or what. as long as you treated yourself and others well, you'd be accepted. god would want all of his children to come into his arms once more, and sit by his side. everyone is welcome.  and now about jesus. and i know this will offend people. but christianity is a massive cult, with more people. in fact, the reason christians were slaughtered in the early years of the church was simply because they were thought to be cult followers. what the christian religion tries to do, and this is the major similarity between christianity and islam, is divide people against non-christians. christianity, although preaches tolerance, love and freedom, is seldom practice by its followers, even it's most devoted followers in the case of the sex abuse scandals of the catholic church. few people actually understand who jesus was. if jesus was here on earth, he would be the hippy kid you'd make fun of at lunch, with his nappy hair, his sandals and his fashion sense. i believe that jesus existed, i believe he was killed, but i don't believe jesus "died for our sins" whatever the hell that means. i believe he was just a peaceful man with a message. i believe he was arrogant, of course, for he wanted a church to be built after him. he was basically a man with a good message who wanted it to be remembered. and it has been remembered. it's a good message, but son of god, sorry, that's too far-fetched for even me to believe. and i hope nobody takes offense to this, because no disrespect is intended for JC.   that about does it for monday night, phish's IT documentary was on TV, very, very cool. reaffirmed what i knew all along that the Breakup was slightly planned. unfortunately, they didn't tell me when i had the chance to hit up three Vegas shows this spring. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, boy. man. god. shit.   thanks to all of you who empathize.
