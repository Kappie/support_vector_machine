(this link will expire in 9 days. in the future, please visit:  urlLink photo gallery  for a working link) also, this was a happy day. i actually had the 3rd dream about our car working last night, so i went down to pepboys and installed the aluminum block sealant. it apparently worked, and i drove for thirty minutes in rush hour traffic all the way home. yippee! the car is safe in our parking garage. let's hope it's fixed.
