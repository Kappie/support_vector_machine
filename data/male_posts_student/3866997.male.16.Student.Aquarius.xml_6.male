I just came home from a boys boarding school in British Columbia and am now pursuing a career in law. I have aspirations to a political career and would like to one day be President of the United States. (Republican, btw) My parents are divorced, and I haven't seen my father in almost a year. We stopped talking after he went insane and tried to harm my mom. Hm, I do believe that pretty much covers things. I hope you enjoy my little postings, and remember... Vote Smith/Tate for Election '24! =)
