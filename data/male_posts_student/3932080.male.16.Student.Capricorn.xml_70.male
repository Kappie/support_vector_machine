Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Pieces of Me -Ashlee Simpson  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #16  In the early 90s, it took  The Cure  a full workweek to confess love, as described in their glam smash “Friday I’m in Love” ( “  I don't care if Monday's blue/Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too/Thursday I don't care about you/It's Friday I'm in love  ” ). Over a decade later, attesting to both the  times ‘a changin’  motif and the rapid rise of her own fledgling stardom,  Ashlee Simpson  has released “Pieces of Me,” in which she waits only until Wednesday to fall into adoration with fellow pop-rocker  Ryan Cabrera . Quickly climbing the charts with dreary acoustic verses (a pop remix of those in  Shawn Colvin’s  “Sunny Came Home”) and a bright chorus (which weds  Jason Mraz’s  “The Remedy” and  Sheryl Crow’s  “The First Cut…”),  Ashlee  will likely trump her sister a second time by claiming the highest  Simpson -family charting ever. Going back to that retro-research, it’s relevant to cite  MC Hammer  in his boast that we couldn’t touch him (circa 1990). Now,  Ashlee Simpson  is asking for us to take a piece of her. So as opposed to the  "waiting for love"  and  "straying from touching"  attitudes of yesteryear, this generation is jumping into relationships and grabbing handfuls of each other, all while our new favorite  Ashlee  (Olsen who?) is singing the soundtrack.   The Verdict:  6.9/10 - The Fork   (3.45/5)
