Everything seemed so much nicer here when I was here in Spring Break doing a little soul searching. I guess thats cause I was here for something and I knew this was the best place to do it...and this is why. Its a whole bunch of nothing with no distractions. This is why I liked it when I was here spring break. No distractions which was good but now that  I have my life somewhat together, it is like nothing to do and it bores the hell out of me. Both my cousins work so they arent home during the day and there is nothing else to do. No more internet at their house cause their mom took it away but luckily there is some at Coreys house (my oldest cousins house). So there, I mean I cant wait to get home for a couple reasons 1) Someone really special is at home which I feel like I can  never  get enough time with and now I will be home for good 2) It will be nice to be home longer than a week and 3) Will mark that all my trips are done for the summer. I know some of yall are prolly saying "Man, I would love to get out of here and just go somewhere else" Well I guess I'm just complaining because Ive been living that fantasy ALL SUMMER and I'm sick of living out of a suitcase. Thats all...and Im so tired of being away from Meeta.Yeah, so I will be home for good eitherSundayor Monday and yeah....that will be it. No more travling for me. So yeah I guess the only thing exciting that has happend to me up here is I got to see my cousins new house which is really really cool. I mean its only one bedroom but thats ok cause he is the only one living here. Its quite big actually for one person and the living room is really big I think. I really like the set up for the computer lol....its got a recliner as the seat and the keyboard can go aways so yeah...sit and type in absolute comfort. =) So yeah, spent the night here last night which was cool. Spent some good time with my cousins and yeah...no one had to work last night. =) Alright so I am going to make this a short one because Im heading back over to my aunts house to help put in a pool. I will be home in a few short days and will be back for good. Im out....   i miss you....
