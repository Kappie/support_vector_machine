The main point of this post isn't to banish idiots from my already underviewed weblog, no, it is to sing the praises of  urlLink gMail . gMail is a scary thing indeed, if you think so, go and read  urlLink this . Whilst much of it is true, I haven't come across the dodjy advertising yet, but then, I don't talk about that sort of stuff. To be honest, not many of my emails are interesting enough to be of any interest to anyone except me, if you follow. Therefore, I don't really care about some computer program reading my emails and choosing adverts for me, in a way, it's quite useful. I was talking about palmtops/clies with a friend, and got an advert for a direct comparison, something I was interested in for a while. The adverts aren't intrusive either, they just sit at the side, all text, no flashing lights.  Right, now I've got over the bad bits... The good things... 1. gMail is  fast . Really fast. I'm running dialup 56k - it's horrible, believe me. Anyway, gMail loads almost instantly, and all. 2. gMail is  clean . I know, that doesn't mean much, but it looks good, and doesn't take up more space than required with fancy graphics. 3. gMail is  big . I mean, you get a gigabyte. A  GIGABYTE . I mean, that's more than my old computer. Wow! 4. gMail is  free . Yes, I know, so is hotmail, but that is bloated, fat, and smelly. You get big flashing picture adverts etc.  There is more, but I'm tired. Goodnight. I promise to post from Greece! -- Dom Out
