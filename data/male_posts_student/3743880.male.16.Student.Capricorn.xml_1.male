Reviews are gay, so I'll just write what I want  Kill Bill Vol. 2: If you know, or maybe don't know, but this movie is the 2nd half of what should have been one fucking long movie. Anyways they split it in two pieces; this being the better half. To tell you the truth I thought they looked gay at first...it was a woman who did kung fu, none of two are very amusing on screen. But I heard it was good, so I bought the first one when it came out, and got my dad to take me to see the second one (I'm 16, He pays my ticket, he gets me admission). I can see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's much more slow paced than the first one, but in my opinion that kind of makes it better. What was cool, was when Her(the bride/ Beatrice) and Elle went at it in Budd's trailer. Speaking of Budd, he also became my favorite character, making me sympathetic to his eventual death. What pissed me off (in a good way), was that Elle had to kill him...with a snake.  Grossest Part? When Uma thurman pulls out Elle's other eyeball, then proceeds to step on it while the camera is zoomed in. My rating (out of four) **** Go see this movie, but see part 1 first    Miracle What a cool movie. I knew the Americans beat the Russians in hockey like rocky beat the guy up in one of my other favorite sports movies. What I didn't know was the story behind it. Theres no denying its good, but theres nothing special about it. Maybe it seemed cooler to me because I had taken a few hits before I got home and watched it. Oh well, that's about all there is to it. *** It's worth watching  21 Grams This movie ranks up there among with Requiem for a dream and Pi for the weirdest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean it's not good though. My English teacher suggested this to me. To give you a little background 21 grams means how much weight you loose whenever you die. It has nothing to do with drugs, although they are used in the movie. The premise of it is that Sean Penn is a smoker, and gets lung cancer..he knows he's going to die unless he gets a heart transplant or something like that. Naomi Watts lives happily with her two daughters and her husband...till they all get hit by a car (driven by benicio del torro). You get background on him too, and you are sympathetic towards him. Since the husband died, they give his heart to sean penn. The little girls die also, but its not important. Sean Penn becomes healthy, Benecio is torn between turning himself in and running, and Naomi Watts just sits at home and mourns. Her and Sean Penn eventually hook up, and then the shit hits the fan. I wouldn't want to ruin the ending..... *** 1/2 Weird   Mystic River  Fuck lost in translation....that was so overrated and boring, this is the real deal. While my favorite movies of all time are LOTRs, this should have won if LOTRs didn't. All of the performances are amazing, and it's a great story, great directing too. Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, and Tim Robbins were all friends as kids. Tim Robbins gets abducted then, and molested by two men before he escapes. He never fully recovers mentally. Kevin Bacon becomes a cop, and Sean Penn becomes a mafioso guy who owns a grocery store somewhere in Boston. Sean Penn's daughter dies, linking all three of them together as adults. This is probably the best murder mystery movie I have ever seen....not that I've seen that many, and not to jump to conclusions. A little slow paced, but it's not too too bad. Good ending. ****
