Their lead singer, Lauri, has very dramatic hair with feathers abound in the quaff.  It's strange.  And yes, I realize Lauri is an uncommon name.  The band is Finnish.  The other three members are named Pauli (guitar), Eero (bass), and Aki (drums).  The album is very good.  The sound of the Rasmus is a rock-oriented groove with catchy melodies and haunting vocals.  There are also some interesting stereo effects in some songs (namely, "Guilty" and "In My Life").  The two singles released from the album so far, "In the Shadows" and "Funeral Song", are both very good, albeit a little too radio-friendly.  However, no deduction is made from this, for mainstream radio has yet to grasp onto these guys.  Rating: 4/5
