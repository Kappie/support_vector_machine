Well, I was just removing the pressed dried sunflower petals out of the year books and i couldn't resist the temptation to peek into them. *LOL* Everyone was so cute back in secondary 1, all the baby fats are still intack. I even got Tara to flip throught her copy too... There was a xiao shuai ge, whom later on metamorphoses to a charming young lady. And also some alien looking fellow that went looking L.K.K. (Lao Kok Kok, meaning old) and looked lamer  lamer ever since... Everyone changed so much during those 4 years. There was never a year where by my hairstyle will look alike in those class photos, I guess that's what you call messy hair. Oh well...     And here's something that should not be forgotten:   HAPPY 39th BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!
