We need to find a place by the end of the month so we can be moved by the first of Febuary. I am weighing the idea of staying at this place until things are a little better, but, who knows, it might be like this for a while. They still have our $2000 deposit. that would play for a nice apartment's deposit and 1st months rent. I have to go to the DMV next tuesday and take the test to get my license and register mimi's car in california. I will do mine at a later time.  YEA! I just got a call and I have a phone interview on Wednesday with Legacy marketing group!!!! I'm stoked.   current mood: accomplished current music: the vss - evolution
