All the time wasted so far though when I think about it since Wednesday, and I still haven't really done any of my devos. I feel kinda guilty now about that. I pray for God to clear out more time for me, and when I do have the time...I somehow waste it away either on the compy or doing some other stuff. Yeah I should really stick to my prayers and act upon them when God does something for me. So yeah back to doing my devos starting tomorrow. Oh yeah tomorrow's father's day too haha...almost forgot =P.  For my day today I started it off waking up at about 10:30 or so. Went downstairs and began to practice my piano in preperation for my last lesson of this school year. I sound like crap right now...having not practiced for two weeks hehehehe. SO did that, ate, and then headed out for lesson.  Basically was briefed today on how I should practice a wee bit over summer just to keep my skills in....and not forget them come September. I'm doing my exam in February, so yeah I better be able to do this stuff by then so this summer I will be in front of the keyboard a bit.  Got home and basically from 12pm-4pm I did nearly nothing but sit in front of comp, watch TV, ball, eat, and sleep, with those not in any particular order.  Jason then came over. We played some NBA Street and then went to HYPE.  Getting real lazy now, I'll summarize HYPE tonight real quickly:  -Sang some songs of praise -Ate -Chilled  Yup that's it. Now I'm bored and probably going to sleep. Later.
