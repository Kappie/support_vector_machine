The weather outside was as dreary as the old man in the frozen tundra, stuck where he is with no hope of survival, the ice slowly working its chilling magic on his aching joints and bones until he at last feels the blistering warm embrace of death.  My uncle, Bob Foster, passed away from cancer today.  It was a cold day.
