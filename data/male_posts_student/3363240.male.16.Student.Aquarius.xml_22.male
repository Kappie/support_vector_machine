After that we went to get boba because I wanted to....and I saw leah...we said hi, and she told me she had my book for me (I let her borrow "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail",) so I said "YAY! can I get it?" so I went to her house for a couple of minutes to get it. We ended up talking for a while, having some laughs....and when I get back to dan, david, erik, and joe....they are all angry...with good reason...but they had each other..so I didn't understand why it was so vital that I left. It wasn't even for that long.  So when I get back, dan starts giving me shit...so I said that I was sorry, but he said "dude...I would never do that" (or something like that) and I got pissed, because he's done that to me before...it was just stupid...he should have stopped it there, but then he said "and especially that you have a girlfriend, I would never do that."  I was totally fucking pissed. For dan to doubt my loyalty to kaya was unneccesary, and rude, and just FUCKING ASSHOLE It ruined my day. It really hurt me. He of all people should know how much I love her, and how faithful I am to her. Man.....I was totally miserable. I still kinda am. It hurt me so bad....to be doubted on that.....I love her with all my heart and soul, and show it with pride...and for him to say that he doubted me..made me feel like I was doing nothing. so after that we got food, and went to davids house to have a fire...and while I "let it pass" I was fuming inside....I needed an outlet...and there wasn't one. Then kaya called and said she was in little japan town. We went, and I was so happy to see her....it made me feel happy again. It was really brief, but fun. We also saw David....which was super fucking strange. I really dislike him....but meh.  When I got home...I felt inspired to make a background...and I made one...I really like it. I'll figure out how to host it somewhere. ~Elan p.s COMMENT PLEASE I NEED THE LOVE
