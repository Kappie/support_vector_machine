It has to be like 2pgs long. I seriously can't think of so much shitz to write. Time passed real quick and 2 periods were gone juz liddat. Poor lil' pig and fat pussy cat had to go for their B.B. L0L! Fat pussy cat made me surrender my packet of sweets b4 leaving too! So mean of him to do tt. L0L! Greedy lil' !@#$%^  Mid way thru the day, there was something realli happening. Someone said this to me "The more I look at u, the cuter I think u r." Wahahaha, veri touched man. Hmmm, suddenly I'm feelin like a bachelor man. I like 4 gers at a time. L0L! Out of the 4 of them, I onli told 2 of them b4. I didn't realli get an answer frm 1, the other 1 said maybe after the 'O's. Hopefully, she'll remember me. I dunnoe if I shld ask the other 2, but if I do, it won't be rite now. It will probably be after the 'o' lvls.  During A Maths lesson, my teacher delievered some news to us. He said those tt got below 35 for the mid-yr will no longer stay in the cls anymore. We're going to be taught by another teacher in the Maths Rm. How wonderful man, now I hafta do my A Maths homework. *sighz*  After school, I skipped focus and went for lunch wif Ze Hao. I was too tired to study any further. After eating we went to 7-11 and slack. I bought a copy of 8 days and there were a hell lot of shitz in there man, damn interesting. L0L! We slack and talk rubbish till around 3:45pm. L0L! When I got home, I took a shower and continue reading the magazine. When I finished reading it, my eyes were closing and b4 I knew it, I was asleep.
