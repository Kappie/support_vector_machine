Got my next exam today: Statistics!  I'm going to take it, then I'm going to come home and clean shit off the floor.  This is the reason there is shit on the floor:      Pooka   She's probably the cutest dog alive.  We found her on the side of the 836 (the airport expressway) running around in a panic.  Put up ads and everything, but nobody claimed her.  So she's ours.  All ours.  Muahaha.
