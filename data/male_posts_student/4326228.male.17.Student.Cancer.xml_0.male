Free from the influence, guidance, or control of another or others; self-reliant:  an independent mind.      Not determined or influenced by someone or something else; not contingent:  a decision independent of the outcome of the study.      often  Independent  Affiliated with or loyal to no one political party or organization.     Not dependent on or affiliated with a larger or controlling entity:  an independent food store; an independent film.        Not relying on others for support, care, or funds; self-supporting.     Providing or being sufficient income to enable one to live without working:  a person of independent means.           O how I want to and dream of being completly independent, by my self, on my own no one eles to support me! That would be the greatest thing in the world right now to live by my self and feed my self and hook my self up with all the toys I want becuase I am in a very well state of independance. That would be so tight and I look forward to it :) Anyways to take this a step farther as I do with every thing eles in my mind.  When people are dependant on something that gives that thing power to be used any way it pleases. I'm not saying magical power but when you are dependant on something and it is takin away, you are hurt. Depending on the level of dependance tells how much of a loss it will be. For example and Ill keep it simple, forks are no longer being made, we are dependant on the fork making companies or what ever to get the supplies and supply the stores with the forks that is then sold to the customers of the store. Owell its just forks, Not a big loss.  Now we run out of air to breath,  we all die.  Big loss  More about this fork thing, So we buy from the fork companies so we are dependant on them for forks. what are the fork companies dependant on? They are dependant on the metal to be made for the forks and with out the metal, We the customers dont get any more forks. Prices go up until no one is buying them any more or the metal is just simply gone. Therefor the metal company goes out of buisness, the fork companies go out of buisness and we the people are there with out our forks. Who wins here? The people do, the people were not making any money off this and forks were never too needed, hell we can use a fucking stick if we have too. (chop sticks) we have other resourses to be dependant on.  Now take this same story but say the fork company cant sell any forks becuase every one is using sticks now. Who wins here? Well the people were not envolved in this crash at all becuase we are busy using our sticks. No metal or forks envolved so we are in the clear. The metal company just says fuck it and goes back to making cars and airplanes. who the hell uses forks anyways? and the fork company goes bankrupt and starts a whole new thing like selling chop sticks.  What I'm trying to get at is there is ways to mold this whole            independent  and     dependent   thing and if you take a good look around you it is being used and abussed all over the world. To a point to where if we are dependant on something enough we may even go to war over it. A big example but I'm not saying we are only in war over this is Oil. just SAY this whole war is over oil. Iraq cut us off cuase we pissed them off and we were clearly dependant on them for oil. Who loses here? This one is not so hard to tell that we the people here in america are no longer getting oil. [Yeah thats too bad, we lose]    Now that I stated what the independant thing was all about, now to learn how to use it to your advantage or relize a step before someone eles takes advatage over you and screws you over. Sometime in your life you are bound to lose something your are dependant on whether its big or small doesnt matter your still missing out on something. The first step to preventing this is simply knowing what conditions your in and what conditions your sources of dependancy are in. You may simply lose a dependant source becuase it runs out just like the metal in my first story. Knowing that the metal is running low ahead of time will give you time to break off from being dependant on it. Knowing that there is a war about to break out between the fork company and the metal company ahead of time is also good, becuase most likly the metal company will cut the fork company off and we are stuck using chop sticks becuase the fork companies no longer have metal to work with. Stay ahead of the game, keep on your toes and always knowing what is next is one of the key parts. Knowing whats around the corner to come will give you an idea of what is needed to be done.  I will admit that using the whole fork and metal thing was a little random but I used them for a point. The point that is needed to be known if you ever plan to use the    independent  and     dependent thing   to your advantage. My point being that knowing how it all works out you can then use it on ANYTHING! Yep every body is dependant on something and that makes us weak. But every one is weak so if you know how to use the weak, that makes you stronger. Ill now give a example of when I used this theory to my profit all the time. Yes it may be lame but its better then the whole fork idea and its true.  I used to run a team and as the leader I made the choices. My team and I got good enough to where sponserships and new members were being tossed around left and right. I managed to get over 300$ worth of servers and shit for free! and now that I think of it, it was 300$ a month and it lasted for a good year. All I had to do was play a danm game too. WRONG there was so much more to it then that. I did not get all that stuff for free off of one choice and sponsership. I had to make the right choices going back and forth from better to worse to obtain these sponserships. As I said before, stay ahead of the game and know whats around the corner. I knew what was up and when I made choices that may have seem really fucking stupid at first, ended with over 3600$ in free shit and thats only including part of the things I had.  What were these choices I made? Well one of the choices that may have seemed not so great at the time was completly getting rid of a sponsershi[ that was hooking me up with a free vent server. Why did I do this? Becuase I knew of a new company that was going to come out, I knew how big they would become becuase I knew what their resources were. I droped my little sponser becuase being sponserd by some little thing is shit compared to being sponserd by nuclearfallout. Plus to be honest it made us look bad. Anyways enough with the whole gaming thing, I droped my team and got rid of all my sponserships becuase I was always working on things for hours at a time which was no fun. But as I stated before You have to be on top of things. It got so bad I can remember talking with an old g/f and having to stop becuase I had to talk with sponsers and see what they wanted me to do for them. They had the power to take away my sponsership and I did not want to lose it. I was dependant of them Anyways so yeah, would have to stop talking with a girl friend of mine just to go work on server settings or practice or see how they want me to advertise for them. So I said fuck it and quit the whole thing not to long ago becuase I was tired of doing all this shit for no money in my pocket. It was quite some work...  Now that I droped the thing, I found out just how dependant this company was of my team. Infact I said i would keep doing it for money but they said no anything but money. They even offered to pay for more servers... They lost one of their best teams and we helped make them look better so more poeple looked up to us and seen we were using nuclearfallout for servers and that if we are using it, they must be good. Thats the whole reason anyone would sponser you in the first place pretty much is advertisment and knowing this is just another way You can use the independant thing to your advantage.  Knowing about being indpendant and dependant is really helpful in life. It has helped me be a great leader for many things besides just gaming and maybe it will even help me in the future if I just find way to use and abuse it. (Ill be filthy ritch someday)  I typed this up just as it came to mind, took me a while but I typed it really fast. If things dont make sense, I dont care. I got what was on my mind on "paper" so I'm happy. Plus earlyer I had another one of thoes danm reality checks. I need to put my mind through more work. "Good things are bound to come" as I think she said. lol  My "homework" is done and now to listen to some Seatbelts  (Cowboy Bebop's theme song maker,  its jazz music)
