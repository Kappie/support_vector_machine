So that ruined my original plan; the floor plan wasn't conducive anyway.  I was going to try again after lunch, and left lunch a little earlier to go hang out outside of French.  I was talking to Melody, Emily, and later Ian and Loren there, who were all goading me to go over and do it.  But there was such a big crowd, and I only saw that she was by herself for like less than a minute - and even then she was right next to like three other people - so I didn't think that it would work.  In my planning, I had always pictured there being very few other people around.  It just doesn't work when there's that much commotion.  Today wasn't really the right day anyway.  It didn't feel right.  I hadn't even checked out the Living Arts section since I was in a big hurry this morning because I hadn't studied for a vocab quiz.  Anyway, I think I'll try a calm, anticlimactic thing, but I'm not saying when or where since I don't want to be goaded or like have a prepared audience.  I'll let you know the result.  Otherwise, I was actually OK in gym today, i.e., I tried (but failed multiple times) and our team actually won.  It's still not going to make a difference, since we are not going to get the highest score, and one free does not really matter that much.  Both examinations today were easy.  Also, I don't know whether Melody's latest post was supposed to be me-bashing in that line that was mentioned, but cut it out; I know you find my stuff interesting.
