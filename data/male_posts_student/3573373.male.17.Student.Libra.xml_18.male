"smashed into pieces" -silverstein (yeah what shane, i like ptw remember?!)  my beloved computer comes back to me tomorrow (and maybe 'beloved' is a bit of an overstatement). i am very much excited about that. i'll actually be able to be deppcore again, (or not now that ive found avril) and resume trance production asap. hey, i'll even get word installed after an entire year of super ghetto/hardcore english essay production. wow. i just remembered how much that sucked, not that it matters now. anyway, time to stop talking before i incriminate myself further for being a ubernerd tech master linux using 1337 h4x0r.  ............  i hate the police.  their shit has gone too far. after recently being hassled by them, and with j-lo, and their increased patrolz, i have a much soured opinion of them. even though the cop that talked to me was actually a nice guy, fuck them for being harralded as heroes for keeping jueveniles 'in line.' santa rosa may not have a huge crime problem, but i am sure that the police have better things to do than to chase down kids who haven't done anything to anybody. oh well, fuck the police, NWA style. they know what happens when they come down my block... absolutely nothing.  ............  xxavrilcorexx: ahhhhhhh your existence is pointless !!! then!!! xyagex: awesome xxavrilcorexx: then fucking die!!!! biaaattch!  god i love aim.  ............  alright, this post is going nowhere and fast. i think its better if we just end it.  live from baghdad, -nick
