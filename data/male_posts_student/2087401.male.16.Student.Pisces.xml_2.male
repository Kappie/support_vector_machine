I finally do, and as I pass the commons, I see Laura, smoking, with some tough looking guys.  I grab the cigarette and stamp it out, and I start going off on her, then the guys attack me and I run.  Piece Two:  Levi and Matt Stevens try to get me to cut Theatre Arts class ands go to lunch.  I steal a box full of Babylon 5 stuff from a teacher and give it to another teacher for no apparent reason.  Pece three:  I'm in an apartment building with Stephanie Settle and Claire Larew.  I have a raw fish, and I'm cooking it in the fireplace.  Claire climbs out the window, presumably to catch a fish.  A mob of girls comes in and fills up the room.  I clear a path, and they all start telling me I can fly with a running start.  But I never find out, because I don't try.  Piece four: something about a bear, a giant goose, and moving pearls with my mind.  Vaguest of all.
