Everything is now painted, and 90% of our furniture has been moved, so I am stuck sleeping on the floor here because we have no cable / internet at the new house until Tuesday. I am going to sleep there tonight though, I have a bunch of movies and DVD's to watch, and that way I'll somewhat have the TV, and I will have a really good sleep too. I need it.   Yesterday I woke up at 11ish, and I went back to bed around 2pm, and slept around 7pm. I am still kind of wiped out from cutting the grass and everything. Has been a big job with painting and moving furniture and what not. Once the entire move is over though, we're all going to be so much more relieved.   So nothing too much else is going on, I have a funeral to goto on Saturday morning for Robbie's dad. His sister got in town last night so we went to visit them. It's really sad, and I feel so weird because I don't know what to say to them, other than sorry for your loss. I know that may mean a lot to them personally, but I feel there's more I could do, it's just that I don't know what. Anyways, funeral will be sad, I really don't like going to them, they are so depressing and morbid. I hope this is the only funeral I have to goto for awhile.   Until Then  The final stage, As the last bit of strength is revoked.  The final moment, As the last seconds are no more.  The final breath, As the last of the air inside you escapes.  The point of no suffering, As you slip away from the physical life.  The point of true return, As you enter a spiritual world.  A place in which suffering is non-existent,  A place in which happiness flourishes,  A place in which one day, we will all be united.  An endurance we must all face, An endurance that we may fear,  Death, by peace. Peace, by death.  We will all rest. Sooner or later.  Until then, rest, in true peace.  Â© Tyler Kuhk 2004  I wrote that the other night, as all I could think about was death and how we, and people close to us, are not going to be here forever, and that death is something we must endure both directly, and indirectly. And, I will admit, I am terrified of death. It's something I wish never has to happen to me, unless I know for SURE what is going to lie afterwards...  I suppose that's where faith comes in. I do believe in an afterlife, but it's the whole unknown thing that frightens me. I'm not too sure what to expect, and in life, there is so much to expect and think of, but when dying comes into thought, my mind completely goes blank and I can't think or expect anything. That's what scares me. Something I am unable to comprehend.  I guess I will have to find out one day, but for now I want to discontinue this post because death is not something I like to talk about....  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   I will post within the next few days, hopefully with something a little more happy...
