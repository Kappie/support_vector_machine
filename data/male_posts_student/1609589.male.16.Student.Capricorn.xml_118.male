And the winner is...  The Disc from TRON  and  The Lightsaber from StarWars!  Do you agree? Of course you do! I'm a clown-pirate! I will EAT YOU!!!!  Something has been bothering me- people who get on AIM, but don't want to chat to people.  I know a couple people who leave their instant messenging program on all day and their profile/away message says something like "Don't talk to me, go away, I don't feel like chatting."  And I have one question for those people.  ARE YOU STOOPID!??!?!!?  Instant Messenging programs are made for one thing, and one thing only. Chatting. AIM and other IM programs may have other features, like ads(:-O), Stock/News Tickers, but who the hell uses those? They're unreliable! AIM clearly states under its stock ticker(if youre not using Dead AIM, a fine program if i do say so myself), "information at least 15 minutes late."  "Holy shit! I've been ass-broke for 15 minutes? I just bought ALL the memorabilia from Star Trek AND all the magic cards in the world on ebay!"  It doesn't HAPPEN!!!! If you're not gonna chat/dont have any reason to get on (sometimes even I don't chat, but that's because sometimes i CAN'T and i post my phone number up so people CAN call me and CHAT!!!), then get off the damn internet, you're lagging everybody else up... :-D  That means- don't keep your AIM on if you're going away for a week, don't keep AIM on if you just had a fight with your friend and don't want to talk. Stuff like that, it's simple.  And also, I have one more thing to say that's semi-on-this-topic.  ATTENTION ALL TYPERS WHO USE ABBREVIATIONS!!! Please, PLEASE learn to type in ENGLISH!!!  I am sick and tired of "hy man, how r u 2day? I tink its tyme to go 2 t3h m4ll and watch sum movies, blahh dee blahh de FUCKIN DA!!!"  It's not fucking hard! "ttyl" doesn't cut it! I don't want to be told that you will TTYL, because that's not a word. Can you pronounce it?" I know I can't. Bye! See ya! It's not hard! Bye is even shorter than TTYL! So that means ttyl isn't even an abbreviation! Fucking incredible.  Some abbreviations are acceptable, but that's because it's really useful. Can you express laughing in text? I can't. I can type while having a whole different conversation in real life, but I can't express laughter in text format. That's why it's okay to use "LOL","lmao","Rofl", all those different kinds of things, but only when used sparingly, in between long sections of English.  Most Emoticons(Smiley faces) are fine as well. You probably often see me use ":-O" or "X-P" or ":-D" and more on regular occasions, because it's easier than typing "I'm smiling right now."  I just thought of another topic, but in an effort to not piss off my readers, I'll just keep it safely hidden away in a tiny lock-box until next time. Until then, always remember to get your protein, and BUY A BIKE.
