Its been so long since I've written a blog, and I shall begin once more...  Devastated by my ordeals in my epic when I was an AJ, I decided to try once again to turn over and become a straight, but I know that it is almost impossible, so I shell slowly do it, and with God's help....  Recently, I've been more active with the Christian communitee in Singapore, now that I've moved my focus away from the AJ communitee... My two best friends, Simon and Haryanto are now closer to me then before, I went to play soccer with them too, even though I much prefer swimming, I still did tag along...  On a friday, I went to the Festival of Praise along with the Agape youth, it was cool.... Darlene Zach and her whole Hillsongs team was there! We spent a very enjoyable night praising God and worshipping Him....  Coincidentally, Yuan Long, aka cPazo was there too, along with the infamous Hobbes.. ( i have nothing against hobbes, really! In fact, i treat him more like a fren then most myplacians). Yuan Long is a passionate Christian, who... I do not know for what reason, stumbled into the AJ communitee... I pray tat he will not be lured to become an AJ too...   It is absolutely true... Once you're an AJ, it's almost impossible to turn straight again, unless you have help, and I mean supernatural help...  Recently, I've become less active in #Myplace and #AJ and more active in #Christian and the new channel #FoP... It is there when I met a new friend, Nerrine... She is quite a new Christian, taking from the depth of knowledge of the bible, but I admire her zeal for evanglism... She wanted to take us to her church service along with YL and a few others, however, in the end, only me and YL ended up going... Her church service is full of life and vigor, and I find the speaker, a bit abstract, but nevertheless, meaningful.... I wish her all the best in her future endevours....  I've also taken a post as an MD at #MP3Downloads, from there, I can receive latest information on the release of new albums and artiste etc, however, I will be sharing my vast library of songs with 100+ people who leech songs day in and day out...  During the past few weeks, my didi told me that he liked me... I really dono what to say... Because my heart has grown too cold towards outright love... I really cant accept it... Moreover, I've already told myself to try and become straight... Its hard.. but I wont let anybody stop me....  Yesterday, I went with the agape youth to Marina Bay... We eat and eat and eat and eat.... haha... to celebrate Jasons last day to be with us before going into NS.... (celebrate? lolz)... I then rushed to the nearest arcade over there to play Para para... Then i met a long long long long lost fren... JY... This cute little boy.. sigh.. haha..... He stood by my side while I was playing para para.... and said he wanted to learn too! haha... wow... i really dont mind teaching him... haha..... but I'm still not flawless... Matthew is still better..... for now....  Today has been a hyper uneventful day... I got worked up over the computer in the morning, formatted the computer in the afternoon, and came back with 8x as much speed in the evening.... Fast... but I think I lost some important documents...  I'm also wondering if I should open an account for Nicholas le...   Mood: Blank, Dreamy.....
