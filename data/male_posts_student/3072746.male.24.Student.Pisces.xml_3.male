They showed me around their new, beautiful home, and I also had the pleasure of meeting the addition to the household, their bouncing baby, Zachary.  Right now he's working on focusing on individual people, but I'm sure he'll soon learn to do the dishes, take out the trash, mow the lawn, rake the leaves, resurface the driveway...     urlLink    A little bit of father-son bonding.    urlLink    And then there were three.  Ah, look at those smiles of pre-toddler bliss. urlLink
