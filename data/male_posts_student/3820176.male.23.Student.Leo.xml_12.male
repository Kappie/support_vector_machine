Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night.  I'm not a big fan of Michael Moore, I think he over-sensationalizes everything and prays on people's emotions, but I still felt he made some good points in the movie.  Given you had to dig through a lot of misleading BS, but there were some good kernels of truth.  I'm still processing everything in it, but glad I saw it and didn't cop out like one of my friends.  Still working on getting moved into my new room at home. Spent the past two days cleaning, prepping, and painting. Still got some more painting and moving to do, but hopefully gonna be moved in by the end of the week.  I guess I've been keeping myself so busy in part to help keep my mind off what I've left behind in San Diego; and its been working fairly well. But today, I was talking to one of my friends and got reminded of one of the hardest things I had to leave behind, and how it's affected someone I care very deeply about.  It just really brought everything back up to the top; how frustrated, angry, and powerless I've felt over this move.  Also how funny love can be.   Awhile back I was "seeing" someone, but things didn't work out.  I tried to be logical and make a clean break of things, but then they showed themself to be a good friend and my heart stepped in and told me I couldn't just throw this person away.  We've since become good friends, and I've come to care very deeply about them as a friend.  And yet, even though I know I'm powerless on my end for things to work out, I keep catching myself falling for this person. If I'm happy or find something cool I want to share it with them, if I'm not sure about something, I want to ask them, if I'm sad I want to go to them for comfort, if I have free time, I want to be them. Damned attractive, fun personality (only slightly annoying sometimes), big heart, and a great mind to boot; what more could one want? But then I catch myself, and feel like I need to do something to pull myself back from that, before I get stupid and waste energy mulling over something I can't change.  It tears me up a little each time, feeling like there's always going to be that in our friendship, but knowing I would be a damned unhappy ungrateful fool to walk away from our friendship. And of course just to make things harder, we're now 500 miles apart. I don't know, maybe being apart for such a long time will allow me to get over them, but I suspect it will be just the same when I get back unless something major happens between now and then. What I do know is that I miss them terribly...
