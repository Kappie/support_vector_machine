She claims this is because black people are always aware that they are black, while white people are not always aware that they are white.  So true.  More on race, I heard Cotter (and Cooper) on npr today.  Cousin, whoes name is French and difficult to spell, is graduating tommorow.  So we are taking a carvan trip down to Delware State to see to her comencement.
