Yesterday it was Sebastopol and now it seems the ninja syndicate rules Napa with an iron fist as well. 90% of every place of business was closed by 1:30, including the "comics stripped" show, which we( urlLink Shawn , Silvanie and I) drove all the fucking way to Napa to see, all the while being incinerated by the merciless sun...Bah... Swift death to Napa/Sebastopol and all who reside in those wretched towns.
