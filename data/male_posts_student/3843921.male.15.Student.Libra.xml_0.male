Well, today I attended Hari Kecemerlangan. ;) I had to endure a lot of boring speeches... and I was seated next to WENG and he was so busy sharing his fantasies with me.. like I wanted to hear them *roll eyes*  And then Nigel took my phone and SMSed to gals something impolite... and I had to apologize to them. Grrrr.......... At least I got my 5 prizes later on!  I was also busy talking to my friends; Sanjit and  Jo Wearn while listening partially to  WENG.    Thats all for today ;)
