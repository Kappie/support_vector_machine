It's official: the NHL season is over and the  urlLink Lord Stanley's Cup  has been awarded to (of all places) Tampa Bay... yes, as in Florida. Who would have thought at the beginning of the season that the Lightning, of all teams, would take home the oldest trophy in professional sport? But hats off to both Calgary and Tampa Bay for one of the best series since, in my opinion, the Vancouver/NY Rangers series of '94. Fine, I'm bitter that the Cup isn't coming home to Canada, but at least a Canadian team made it to the final this year. You know it's a good game when my girlfriend Kathy is watching it with me on TV.  So, the season is over... now what? Many of you will be thinking the draft, off-season surgeries, and training camp... How about none of the above? Yes, the dreaded players' strike is right around the corner folks. Once every few years, the  urlLink NHLPA  and the  urlLink NHL  decide that they will play a game of chicken over the collective bargaining agreement. The central question: who will blink first? Who will give in and make the move towards the middle? Finally, the NHL is getting some exposure in the U.S. (forget north of the border, cuz we've always been nuts about hockey up there) and the seats in the arenas are finally being filled... and of course, the league is going to go on strike and kill all the progress they've made. How likely will there be a season next year, you ask? Well, lets put it this way, a large number of players have already signed, or are negotiating, contracts to play for teams in the elite European leagues. So for those of you who are looking forward to the 2004-2005 season, don't hold your breath... it might be a long, long time before the skates will be laced in the NHL arena near you.  By the way, did any of you know that Jarome Iginla's full name is EIGHT WORDS long?!?!
