I've been having a good week so far, Jon came back on wednesday, we ordered 6 Fantomas (RAWK) tickets for; me, Dave, Brooke, Matt, Jon and Paul - we're all seeing them in a week or something... Jon brought games with him, "Metal Arms: Glitch in the system" to name one, it's alot like Fur Fighters if anyone's played that before, but it's much better cos of; tanks, smoother gameplay and you're all funny robots.. sweet..  Yesterday was alot of fun, after school me and Dave met up with Rachel, Helen and Louise and went for coffee again, even though it was overpriced it was still worth it. We sat around in starbucks talking until we decided we had to leave, the staff people putting the chairs around us up and all. Heh.  Then we went back to Rachel's so they could all get changed, then went back to my house (yes it is mine.. all mine..) where we bought SEVENTY pounds worth of pizza. But it only cost Â£42 cos we bought it using special offers, we had garlic bread and salads and everything - only me and Dave finished our pizzas, but Jon ate alot of his plus alot of garlic bread, so hats off lads. Oh yeh, and we made Alex (who was also there) eat a very hot pizza slice.. it was more amusing at the time and we filmed it, he wasn't allowed home if he didn't - we hid his shoes =D  Hopefully the rest of this weekend will go well, going to Croydon today with Dave to meet Dave (lets just call him "Brooke" or "women features") which should be fun, I wanna buy another primus album, cos I'm only 1 short of owning them all. (except the live one, but that's only a compilation really so it doesn't count as much, but I'll buy it anyway at some point) Then on Sunday I'm going round to Alice's, yes, lots of Halo and tea. Heh.  Have a good week all. Hopefully this nice long post makes up for not updated at all this week, that was mostly just to piss off Matt for constantly asking me to update multiple times in one day just cos he was bored on msn.
