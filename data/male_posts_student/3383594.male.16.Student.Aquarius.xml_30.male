This "Cute" tt I'm talkin about is Adorable BUT Ugly, so dun get the wrong impression and think tt I'm callin u handsome, cus there's no chance in hell! L0L! Well, wad can I say? Knowing u has been a bless. U're always full of energy and entertainment. But u've got to learn ur manners man. Haha, and learn when the right time to do certain stuffs ya? Well, I wouldn't say tt ur caring, but somewhere deep down in ur heart I'm pretty sure u do care rite? Haha, sometimes being a sensitive person is much betta than being an "act man" person. And dun get worry when u can't do pull ups, it's not as if ur gonna burn in hell if u can't do pull ups. Haha, yes train urself, but dun train urself so hard till u injure urself and refuse to wait for recovery. I'm pretty sure tt I made the right decision to get to know u. Sometimes I wonder and think about the way u treat me. I would not say it is good or bad, but I would say tt it's weird cus I simply haf no idea how to define it. Haha, I guess it goes both ways ya? Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. Well, I can't expect it to be good all the time can I? Where will all the fun go to den? Haha, u're so much similar and different at the same time frm the person I described in "Choices". Well, I think the similar part lies in the physical apperances of both of u. Haha, as for the differences, I think it's the emotional section. One good example is tt u're not as violent like the other person. U dun go all out to beat or abuse me. Haha, tt's a good thing. But I'm not saying tt the other person is bad in doing all those stuffs. As a matter of fact, I find it quite fun u noe? Haha, seriously I do, it juz builds up my endurance and keeps me entertained. Haha, but I am NOT asking u to do the same alrite? Cus I love ya juz the way u r!"  These are my confessions to u* Note: These are 2 different ppl I'm describing in "Choices" and "Choices Part II".  "1 more thing, it's 5 more days to 4 mths after my b'dae! Where's my Cam dude? Hehe!"
