Its been ages sinc I last blogged, below are my reasons for not blogging:  - Work - College - Big Brother - Chilling  Work is going well, I got paid the other day, I recieved a wonderful £303 (I've just realised I've lost my wage slip :-) They underpaid me, I'm meant have got another 100 pound or so. I also realised I infact earn £4.60 in stead of the £4 I thought I was getting.  On sunday, with work, there is this night out in a wannabe posh place in town. I don't really want to go, and one of the girls who is going really irritates me, so I'm not going to go, unless they let me bring some of my mates - which they won't.  I broke up from college today, which is good. I get my AS Level results on the 19th of August, and I have a horrible feeling that I will get 4 straight E's, I can say honestly, that I am scared of getting my results.  I found out yesterday and today that a girl is playing with me, I couldn't believe it. Some ofyou may know that I sometimes have more than one close lady ffriend if you get my drift. Anyway, now I've settled down, and I liked this girl right, I wasn't messing her around or anything, we were not official yet though, but anyway. Yesterday, another one of her "close" manfriends came to school, I was like what the ****! So she is a nothing now, when things get bad for her, and her other manfriend isn't around, or has split up with her, I will NOT be there to help her :-D  Big Brother is kicking serious butt this year, I love it. Unfortunately, Nadia is still in the house. I don't like her, and want her to go, but yet I want her to stay so she can continue arguing with Jason. Soon, Jason, Ahmed and Victor will gang up on her - I can't wait. Ahmed was a hero this week. "Michelle, I need your jacket to take to the Diary Room"  two minutse later,  "Michelle, I am performing a Military Coup"   You go star.  I'm going Pakistan for two weeks next Thursday, hopefully I'll find a decent diamond ring for myself thee, and a Jcaob and Co Watch. Both are sold here, but here in the UK there isn't any WOW factor with whats on sale. I want a Diamond ring for my little finger, and Imean a kick ass ring, with a face that is just smaller than a 5p coin. It'll be wicked if I ind one with Yellow diamonds as in, as they seriously sparkle. Over there, the economy is weak compared to this countries, things are so cheap over there. So its all good.  I today realised that I may not be able to go to the MJ Trial, if it is around January, or if it isn't taking place during the Easter Holidays. There will be Modular Exam taking place in January which are important - as pointed out by my teacher today.  This is one seriously long entry, so I best end it now, but before I do, I just want to say that our form tutor left school today, so we got him some presents and stuff - aawwww.  I'll blog again soon,  Currently Listening 2: R Kelly - You Saved Me
