I ate breakfast, after that switching on my phone.  Boy oh boy! I was in for a shock! CQ doesn't want to go for MT Oral anymore! First he messaged to meet at 10, then after that he said he wanted to study maths instead. Grr! HaHaHa! That CQ ar!  I studied Trigo lor. I didn't really study as in really study. I memorised the formulas. After that I went online to relax la. HaHa! Even the relaxing cats are meowing.  Okay. I ate lunch, then after that at 12.30, I went out to meet CQ lor.  I met him on the train. We went to CCK together, then board bus 175 to PJ.  We made it to school with lotsa time to spare. HaHa. We met JiaYan. We went into Lt2, instead of the bridge due to too many cats.   The test started. O.O! There were 9 questions! They came in the order of increasing difficulty. Me and CQ can't do the last two questions. Sigh! Well, we feel that we can pass. Barely. Heh.  Putting that test aside. CQ went to play badminton with his sister and cousin and I went home.  HaHa. Went home, bathed, came online, went for dinner, watched TV, came online and watched TV again. Heh.   HaHa! Friends is so funny! Phoebe is so terribly laughable! Little wonder why she is my favorite character! HaHaHa!   The judges for the Singapore Idol is announced. They are Dick Lee, Ken Lim, Florence Tan and the surprise guest whose name I forgot. Heh. TNP got the three supposed judges correct. HaHa! Oh well. I don't know everyone except Dick Lee. Honestly, who don't know him? Meow!  Okay. I gotta end liao. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
