SO many people have already started their revision while me? hm.. of course i have and i have completed just that i still need more time to master every single subject. Life is so bored but quite fun to mix around with different groups of people every now and then. My cicle of friends keep enlarging every now and then. Some people might say that i must be mad to visit a haunted house in the middle of the night at  Changi Beach. Well, i think it fits my character. I am bold enough to try so as my group of friends. This isn't our first time going to such places. We have went to OLd CHangi Hospital and many others. The best thing was that we even took picture at that kind of places where people say ghosts or spirits does appears every night. Up till now we havn't encouter any of these things except that we got chase by guard dogs? or maybe i should say wild dogs. Fun indeed to spend my whole night and wee hours of the morning doing something that not everybody dares to try. Myabe this is what i call life. Though i have many kinds of friends new or old, but i still prefer to be together with my old friends. I am proud to say that they are the only group of people who understands me and the most caring people around me. Haha.. some of you might be jealous but well i didn't comdem you all yet, just that maybe you all still not up to their standard. ;) Time will tell and my opinion will change also. My days in DUnman is counting down, my years in Dunamn is also coming to an end. During my years in Duman, many things has happened to me. I bet this comment goes to all of you too. But me? mostly unhappy memories, happy memories there is but not many. Some of you asked me if i will return to help you in your study? My answer will be yes if you really need my help if not most probably i won't return unless nescessary. Hm.. i shall write till here.. 3 straight days never had a good sleep, today going to sleep like dead human. haha.. ;)   notice:By the way, if you all want to find me, the easiest way is to call or sms me if you want a quick reply.
