I met Bonnie Jean in 6th grade, we were in the same "Core Studies" Room with a nuttso teacher who left us a even more nuttso sub when she took an extended leave of absents.  We weren't best friends or anything but she was a pretty awesome person. The next year we both has Mr Bandel for math... haha what an odd class... One thing about Bonnie that has always stuck with me is how she made me feel like we'd been friends for years, I accually asked her if she remembered something that happened in like 3rd grade even thought she didn't go to my elementry school and I didn't meet her until 6th grade. I think its her genuine kindness and fun personality.    I dont' remember if Bonnie was in any of my classes since 7th grade math, but this year she is in my Bio 1 class... haha what an awesome class (as I've said before).  Bonnie adds to that class but I'm not sure how... haha well Bonnie will aways be a fun memory for all the old years of my life...  -Dan V
