All of my classes are sweet this semester, I really don't hate any teacher yet....can't wait to differ.    Science Fiction is not the easiest class in the world. I like sci-fi, but the class is for upperclass men, and you have to do a LOT of reading, and you always have homework. But yeah, its alright I guess.  I have nothing to do this weekend, so call por favor 734-261-6603 or cell 734-716-2603  I will also own all the Jay and Silent Bob movies =D   Alright Im done
