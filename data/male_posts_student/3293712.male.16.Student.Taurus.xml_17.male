Any way, I'm in Career investigations right now so this will be short. My weekend wasn't that great with the wedding and such. I guess I don't really know what's going to happen the next two nights because anything can happen when you're riding with Mattson.  It's like the magic school bus except it's not yellow, or that big, or that long, or that quiet, or that clean. . .it's not like the magic school bus at all if you think about it.  It's more like a screaming wagon of doom. I guess I should go to a Halo-fest some time, dispite my dislike of the X-box.  Probably this summer some time: I just need a good teacher.  I should be able to learn fast since I started playing video games at age 5.  I'll blog later
