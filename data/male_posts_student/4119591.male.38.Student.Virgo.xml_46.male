Cell phones in the eighties were expensive and, frankly, status symbols. If you could afford one of those things and didn't mind carrying the battery pack around your waist, you could show the rest of the world just how bloody rich you were. I despised these people.  I would never live on a cul-de-sac. For many of the same reasons above, I saw life in the 'burbs and more evidence of conspicuous consumption and wanted no part of it at all.  I would never own or drive a BMW. The Ultimate Driving Machine was, in my mind, the Ultimate Yuppie Machine. My motto was "Die yuppie scum!"  So you might wonder how I'm doing so far on my list of things I'm "never going to do." I own a cell phone. In fact, I cancelled my old-fashioned residential phone line and rely on the mobile phone exclusively. No regrets there. I live an a fabulous home in the 'burbs on a cul-de-sac. So much for that ambition. Finally, while I don't actually own one, the neighbors have a beautiful BMW coupe that stirs a certain amount of awe in me every time I see it. Someday if I give up my motorcycle fetish, I might have to own one of those too. I've grown up (a little) and have found that I have certain materialistic needs. Also, I'm nowhere near as "smart" as I was when I was younger -- in fact, I'm now as dumb as I thought my parents where back then.  What does all of this have to do with anything? Well, almost nothing actually... but you have stayed with me this far so I might as well get to the point. I ran across this  urlLink column  in Newsweek (care of MSNBC) written by Robert J. Samuelson who refuses to own or use a cell phone for more fundamental reasons. He thinks that mobile phones are annoying and unreliable. Someday soon, I may be the last man in America without a cell phone. To those who see cell phones as progress, I say: they aggravate noise pollution and threaten our solitude. The central idea of cell phones is that you should be connected to almost everyone and everything at all times. The trouble is that cell phones assault your peace of mind no matter what you do. If you turn them off, why have one? You just irritate anyone who might call. If they're on and no one calls, you're irrelevant, unloved or both. If everyone calls, you're a basket case. While I think he makes valid points, he's ignoring a few others. For instance, just because you have a cell phone doesn't mean that you have to answer it when it rings or that you even have to let it ring. If I don't wish to be disturbed, I will turn the ringer off and turn the vibrating page feature on (or as I like to called it "pleasure mode.") If the caller-id suggests that the person on the other end is worthy, I'll take the call. If not, they can go to voice jail and I'll call their voice jail at a time of my choosing.   Samuelson complains that people talk on their phones in restaurants and other public places. I don't see these behaviors as evidence of evil cellular technology as much as I see them as just poor social skills. If you won't pick your nose in a crowded elevator, then you shouldn't gab about your painful gall bladder surgery between courses three and four at the Fine Diner. Choose your conversation times and topics carefully and you won't often offend where decorum is required or expected. There's really no need to bury your electronic head in the sand.  So, please keep in touch. My voicemail will call your voicemail and they'll do lunch sometime.
