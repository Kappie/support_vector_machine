HE did mi proud! ahahah coz one day ( i forget when le ). We pass by an old lady selling tissus paper outside the library, near the road. She was singing some odd tune while selling. i've decided to callit -  THE tissue paper SONG . anyway.. no one cares abt her... NO ONE! but PIG! he gave mi a dollar and ask mi to buy from her 3 packets of tissue! haha i'm so proud of him!
