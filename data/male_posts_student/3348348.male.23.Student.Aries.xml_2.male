I really should start taking my studying more seriously, sometimes I feel like more than 15 minutes in front of a  textbook kill me. Tomorrow I will spend at least a couple of hours on that and math.  other than that I'm tired of all the politics here, seriously this country has been nothing more than an eternal campaign the last couple of months, it's incredible how this is going but hopefully I'll be out of here soon. Dinner at don nacho was weird my friends confronted me for being to negative all the time, they say i always see the negative aspect of everything and that they worry I might be depressive,I know I have my problems but things don't seem to call for that extreme.   other than studying I should see if i can get some soon, really it's not even funny anymore. Searching for perfection in a girl hasn't taken me anywhere, I don't know if my standards are to high or if I don't try hard enough but something has to be done about this.  I'll check in again tomorrow to see if i actually did anything of what I said. good night...
