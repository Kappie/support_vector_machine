I caught a little 10-12 year old looking at couple's "how to" sex books. Proxcimity is the key. He managed to keep away from people for a while. I just moved over close to him and straighten'd books and he was quick to bail. Close to close two guys and two gals came in. One guy with a converge shirt and one of the girls with a Beneath the Ashes shirt. I joked around with them and tried to help them find some books but really didn't talk to them much. I suck at making friends. Maybe they will come back. I have to say, I meet alot of "cooler" people thru the book store. I got to talk Bukowski and Burroughs to some punk rock chick. Of Course, we don't have anything cool like that.  There is this cool address book that I need to get for someone. It is all filled with gay pulp art and is sooooo super rad. All these cartoon, hunky guys with no shirts on doing shit like camping and swimming. hahahaha. Some lady supposedly was offended by it a few months ago. surprise. but it is far from explicit.  I had the chance to force feed my first Red Tailed Hawk. Boy, that was exciting. One pissed off bird. I need to go to a show soon. I could use some music.   current mood:  pleased current music: Califone - Fisherman's Wife
