She is staying at my grandparents apartment in Kalethea-where the two ararchist bombs went off a few months ago- and had some interesting stories to tell me about the olympic city.  Firstly the airport. She arrived last week. She got through immigration eaysally, collected her bags, then was on her way out to meet our relatives that live in Athens when a police officer approched her. This is a rough transcript of what happened: Police officer(in broken english):" Where are you from?" Auntie:"Australia" Police:"Where have you come from?" Auntie:"Australia" Police:"So, err, do you have anything in your bag?" Auntie:"..........well" Police:"Anything I would be interested in?" Auntie:"No" Police:"Move on".  As for everyday life in Athens, apart from an increase in tourists, things remain the same. My Aunties cousin, who is an olympic voulenteer, is in the opening ceremony on the weekend. She was talking to my Auntie, and invited, in an offhanded way, for her to come to the opening ceremony practice run today!!!!!!!!!! FULLY SIK!!!!!!!!  My Auntie asked her what security passes or precautions she needed to do to go, and was told she can't bring 1-cameras, 2-mobile phones, 3-coins. Apart from that, she is fine to visit. Coins? Aparently the organisers are worried people will throw the coins at the peformers.  She will be ringing me tomorrow, i'll tell you what is in the opening ceromony.
