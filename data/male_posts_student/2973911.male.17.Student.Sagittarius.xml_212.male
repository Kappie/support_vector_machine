Not saying that I don't think you're attractive because you probably are but I view you with hazy glasses that I just can't seem to clear up. You're the man in the moon in my life who's views of the world are foreign to mine and yet, I can get along with. I think.      Wala na rin nga akong load.He he he...    Ang sinasabi kong bagong crush ay si Kevin Hugo. I know that it's a wierd name but I've checked it out in his ID at iyon talaga pangalan niya.      Crushes go past like ships in the sea. Friends stay forever, specially in our hearts...
