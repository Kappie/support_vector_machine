My roomies rock. Steve is a true punk and Fred is that kind of silent presence that is just plain cool.  And I'm listening to Steve's Irish Punk. this is great.  Oh, and JD: apparently your conference last year was much to rowdy because this year Apple doesn't want NYLF back, so NO TRIP TO APPLE! blargh.  More later.
