As usual, all my mates have pissed off somewhere and I'm left here with nothing to do, as it is weekend after weeked.  I'm getting pissed off with it, so if you're reading, Suprise!  Sam is probably somewhere messing around with Jo or Annie, or biking with Craig (but he cancelled the sleepover because he was 'tired' according to James... hmm), James is prob stuck on the PS2 or on Online games or something, Chris is probably stuck on RPG Maker or something like that,  and here I am stuck INSIDE!  I'm Indoors... Get Me Out Of Here!  Anyways, *End Rant* (soz becky thought I'd nick that :P)  I've put Blink 182 on real loud that should cure some of my depressiveness! There's some cool movies coming out soon so I might go and see them alone... unless anyone fancies coming with me... maybe I might go with my family... I dunno :D.  I spent a good 10 mins making a mobile out of CDs, straws and wire from a pair of broke headphones.  I'd rate it about 4/10, but it was cool anyway.  I was about to stick the thing up and it keeps falling down so stuff that.  You can probably tell from the post I aint in a good mood, so don't come near me or I might bite your head off >:D  What the hell is going on with me today, I feel so... Crazy/Depressed/Edgy/Happy/Excited/Sad... I think I need some Anger Therapy (time to bash the hell out of my pillows!).  That will probably calm me down a bit... hehe argh :S  Maybe it's my time of the month, as Sam said lol  Ok this is like the fourth time I have edited this post now.  It turns out Sam was gonna call for me but he thought my ankle was still bust up so he didn't.  I was just talking to him on MSN then he suddenly went offline like he always does :S  What's with that...
