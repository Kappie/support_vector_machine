IT'S AMAZING!!!! SO MANY BIO-ESSENCE PRODUCTS WAITING ON THE SHELVES FOR ME TO PURCHASE. i'm so impressive by companies which produce such explanatory booklet. 1st was nikon, and now it's B-E. the front page is nice lor, with a nice heading:  Discover the Miracle of Youth Bio-Essence - the essence of women  It has much impact on me sia...Miracle....wow....there's HOPE!!!! it's interesting lah, maybe i'll bring it on sun for u ppl to read..  New: Bio-essence face lifting cream  heyhey, i think janet need this. it was written " Also suitable for men's use". buy lah!! if u find that it has negligible effect on you den give it to me while it's fresh.  i really envy some celebrities.....they are able to use these product for free...... how i wish i'm sammi cheng.... able to use SK II products....( hm, onli the part of her being SK II spokeman worth envy about)
