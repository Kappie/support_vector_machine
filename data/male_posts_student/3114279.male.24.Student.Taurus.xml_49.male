      The comments are back!  You all can now continue to not comment.  Today I was asked an interesting question: If I had a Theme Song, what would it be?  I'm guessing Theme Song as in, a song that would represent me as a person and my personality.  I take music very seriously.  I usually don't just listen to music as just entertainment.  My roommate used to say some stupid thing about good music speaking to your soul or something, and though I wouldn't put it in such cheesy terms, I agree with that sentiment.  My favorite songs make me feel a certain way, a specific way, and the best songs (just like the best movies) give me chills and make me feel incredible things.  I don't really have a favorite song, and I don't really have a favorite band or artist, although if I were pressed, I will usually say Stereolab is my favorite band, based on the fact that I have listened to them for years, since junior high, through all the changes and phases.  But a Theme Song would be hard to choose.  Not just a song that I like or that makes me feel something, or whatever.  A song that says something about me in the best way.  In high school psychology class, one class project was that each student had to turn in a tape or a CD and pick one song to be played to the class, and the class had to guess which student had picked which song.  Most of the class, of course, picked the generic music that was popular at the time, the class guessed mine right away, since I had different tastes.  I'm not sure what the point of that project was.  It's going to take some thought to pick a Theme Song, but I'm going to try.  I'm sure you'd have an interesting Theme Song.  My first week living in Naples is over, and I just have to say, I really love it here.  I was a little worried about being homesick (not very homesick at all), or being broke (I  am  broke), or being intimidated (only a little intimidated), or whatever.  But I love being here, more than I thought I would.  It's definitely been worth it all to move here.  I'm really excited to be starting work, doing what I've really wanted to do, and I'll be excited to start school here.  I like to get to go swimming whenever I want, I like laying around the house with Chud and Samson (my cousin's cat and chocolate lab, both of which I've started to grow attached to), I like going to the pier, I like just driving around, I like hanging out at the used record store, I even like going to the Coastland Center Mall.  I usually hate malls, possibly because of the sorry "mall" back in Lake City.  I'm happier than I thought I'd be.  Sorry to be so positive here, I hate to break the trend of negativity.  There are things I dislike here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.  I finally escaped Lake City.  "We Built This City" by Starship is the #1 worst song according to VH1.  I'm on board with that.
