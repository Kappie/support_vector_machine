They told me that the publisher created duplicates of the unique access codes (how thick do you get?!) and that they would send me new ones within 28 days. But I got no access codes, so I phoned them again today. I resisted the temptation to have a go at them and tell them just how utterly crap PS2 online is and how the Xbox support line is so much better, but I may just do next time if they don't arrive.  I also wanted to cancel my Official PS2 Mag susbscription, because it reads like a book covered in poo when compared with the sublime EDGE. However, their offices were closed even though I read that they were open on Saturdays, so I'll have to phone them on Monday. I just can't wait until they ask me why I'm cancelling the subscription...
