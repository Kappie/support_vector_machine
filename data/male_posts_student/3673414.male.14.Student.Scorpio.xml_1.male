Anywae, still finished the experiments early. They are turning out wonderfully well.  anywae, when i was coming back, i saw this stray cat (actually i saw this yesterday, but...) and it was given food by this stranger. it turned round and shat on the food. That was damn funny. i laughed all the way home. lolz.  Then, come home, homework time. philo essay. wth, i only get half an hour of recreation daily. Lolz, this sux. anywae, started my blog. no time to change anything so used a stupid format. anywae, hope can blog often.   Anywae, overall, i think today was a very fun day. tomoro must go to nus again, so shall end now. thx for reading. ttbb.  Supersonic
