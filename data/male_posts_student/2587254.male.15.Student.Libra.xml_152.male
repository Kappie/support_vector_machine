Actually today at church was pretty fun...with me, Gavin and Steph leading worship.....and Bible Study today wasn't too bland either. After that, some great food from Dragon Court and then....well I WAS gonna go work on my bio project........but I don't have any popsicle sticks to make the gargantuan structures that I have planned. So instead......I went to play B-ball at UCC w/ Jason lol. Procrastinating eh? NOOOOOOOOO! Of course not.......I improved sorta with B-ball....SORTA....  My day started off at 7:50.....quickly getting ready then bolting out the door...AWW NUTS IT'S RAINING! So I had to put something over my compy so the rain won't fry it *if it does* and stowed it away in the back of the car. Ergh if floppy diskettes could hold more than 1.4 megs.....I wouldn't have had to lug my stupid compy to church for a 2 meg file. GRRR! And then off we went to Lina's place to pick her up....and to Jason's like usual. After pickin' em all up....finally we head to church =).  Getting there around 8:30.....we immediately begin to prepare for english worship this morning. Ugh.....this morning many technical difficulties from many of us. For some reason the stupid projector would switch from RGB to Computer input back and forth until Josh set it right....and I plugged the mouse and keyboard plugs in the wrong ports......and MANY other problems occured this morning lol. Luckily though...after some prayer and bashing some stuff......IT WORKED! And of course magical button pressing from Josh =P. So we were ready and underway.....and my presentation didn't go to waste *PHEW!*  So worship started at 9:15 like usual......and well our singing part didn't go that bad. After the Praise part of service....came the sermon. Today's topic: "Following Jesus." Basically the main message through the scripture (Galatians 5:13-18) says that if you live under Christ's faith.....then you will be protected from the grasp of Satan. I really liked the sermon today....and I was actually awake for much of it. Zoned out a bit thinking about some other things......but quickly got back on track. Over history though *on my note* humans have been straying futher and further away from Christ. It may be a difficult, long walk, but with Christ's help....he'll guide you through the right path. I really thought our response song "Pure and Holy Passion" fit in real well, basically with the lyrics saying  that you want God to be your leader, and we may see him and go on after him, following in his Holy and True footsteps...like I said....really liked the sermon today hehe.  After service headed downstairs for some REALLY good cookies.....and then chatted around a bit before class started. Steph spilled some tea.....twice.....and me and Jason made plans to play ball after church @ UCC. And then Bible Study class......(or Sunday School....whichever you wanna call it)  We studied more about Jonah. Mr. Kilik and Victor joined us also. Much debate still about whale or fish that swallowed Jonah, and also if he was stuck in the whale's "air chamber" *aka lung* or his stomach. I say lung since if he waas in stomach.......I was thinkin'....wouldn't HCl burn up Jonah? lol. Anyways enough of my scientific ranting with the Bible......after that class......had to go home early.....mom had to drive some people places and then we headed home for lunch.  Ate some lunch....some NSFU *FINALLY PROGRESSED SOMEWHERE AFTER 4 MONTHS* and Jason read my Brood War strategy guide for more strategies to use on Battle.Net. I just played NFSU.....and changed my car from a Impreza to a RX-7. YAY!  And then ball from 3-5. Hmm my shot's slowly coming back. Jason beat me 1 on 1.....but I beat him at 21 2/3 times. He beat me once....*shrug* I won majority =P. Then we got really bored......and started chucking the ball from half court. Surprisingly....Jason actually made 7 shots from half lol. I amde 4 close ones and many misses. Also I seem to have trouble making 3's....LOTS of trouble lol. So gotta work on that......plus my regular shot + driving if I'm gonna go into Hoop-It-Up with Jason, Calvin, and some other person we still need to figure out lol.  After getting a lift back home from Jason's dad.....I sat around for a bit before heading to David's grandma's place to eat dinner. Ergh........so boring. I mean I don't mean to complain....but it can be pretty boring there....but at least she has satellite TV and she cooks REALLY good food. Why's it old people cook better than anyone else in the world I don't know....but it still proves true.  So got to the place around 6:30.....and filled the timeframe in from 6:30-9pm with eating, watching TV, talkin' to Josh, Steph and Rebecca and playing cards. President, Speed, and a new game I learned called "Yueker?" Anyways it's kinda like hearts.....and bridge sorta......and we play in teams. It's weird.....I still kinda don't get it. Oh well.....time really flies when you're eating.....and I go home =P.  Showered....and now munching on carrots, studyin' for history and.....about to sleep hehehehe. Yeah it's pretty late....gotta head to bed soon hehe. Later.
