MOstly I got drunk and did stupid shit but one good thing I did was I got a Mohawk last monday.  It is a very interesting thing to have and I like it but will probably get rid of it in a week or two because i have to work and make money.  No one wants a kid with a mohawk waiting tables.  I wasn't drunk when I did it just feeling the pressure of life coming at me and realized I would never be able to do this again probably so why the hell not do it now.  What a great reason huh.  Well I'mm of to go home and eat but I'll try to update this more as things continue on.  Peace, love and all that bullshit...
