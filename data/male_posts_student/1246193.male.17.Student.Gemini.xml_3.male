My preliminary list will follow this posting and if you think that you got left off of it, you probably did because your name isn't on the list.  Tell me if you think you should be on it or if you think someone else should be on it and I will make my decision about whether or not the person is worthy of this honor.  Keep in mind that the list is by when I talk to people in class.  If you are high on the list YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL, you just have a morning class with me.  Here we go: First we have the people who are stupid enough to take early bird strength training. David T. Ben U. Megan Mc. Then we have those in the doomed orchestra program. Kristen N. The ever interesting health class. Gregg S. Kelly O'B. I have no friends in the Library. The art class, what else can I say. Ryan R. The first of my privileged lunch tables. Bethany M.  Autumn P. Niki K. Kayleigh C. Spencer W. The other lunch table. Brandi N. Adam S. Megan J. Jennifer J. English, I hope I am not plagerising! Katie M. Espanol. Vosotros es gordo, estupido, y feo. Unfortunately, I have already seen everyone that I want to talk to in another class. Same situation with Algebra II.  You can't talk in that class, you have to pay attention, or jump out a window. The most exciting hour of the day, Physical Science. Kurt H. Laurel B.                                             Here are all the other people that I will talk to, but don't talk to them in any particular class. Kelsi C. Jenny B. Megan C.                                             These are the people I talk to, if your name isn't on the list I didn't forget you,I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU!  However, if you think that I left you off my list but you really do talk to me, well then,                                             you are both wrong and illiterate because I already said I DON'T LIKE YOU IF YOU AREN'T ON MY LIST!  I hope that I haven't angered anyone, oh wait, no I don't.    Remember, this is not the final list.  I have not yet posted my opinions of you, but I know you are looking forward to it.  Talk to you later, I can say this because I talk to everyone on this list. Ciao.
