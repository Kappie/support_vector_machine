I think today has fuelled my [can’t think of the word that goes here] to post that letter. Hopefully she’s now getting the message, that I don’t really like her. Towards the end they was a bad atmosphere, after we argued about sound speed crap. We were talking about concord, and she said ‘I wonder what it must feel like to be on it, things must look really strange’. I explained that it wouldn’t look much different outside as it does in a standard plane, but she was intent on talking about things looking stange when she didn’t actually have a point to her ‘lecture’. She gave me this look as if to say your so stupid, and was saying stuff like whn don’t you understand, it’s really obvious. Errr, excuse me you stupid bitch, who her is in the lowest science set and reads harry potter. That’s another thing we were argueing about, the the dvd I brought around the other day. The comedy in it is to advanced for her closed mind, she just can’t comprehend it. It’s a fucking chick flick for god sake, girls are ment to like it, all girst should like it, I like it, and yet she doesn’t. She is diffinatly part of dumb Britain. The population of Britain that watchs ITV and thinks peter andrey is funny and clever. Sometimes I feel like I’m the only decent, normal, person ain the whole fucking world. Someone who can appreciate good music, film and art. Someone who actually gets ‘it’ - life. So were sitting there on the sofa, I’m trying to get away as far as possible from her and she keeps moving closer. It ends up with her all over me, well, cuddled up to me with her head on my shoulder, which makes me really uncomfortable. Then we were talking about the weird stuff about fingers and toes, and she held my thumb and I really had to pull my hard to get it out of her grip. What the fuck was the stupid girl trying to do. She just doesn’t take a hint, I don’t like her. She’s trying to get all close to me and I don’t want her to, I keep rejecting her advances but she’s just to stupid to pick it up. She reckons I have a weird thumb cause it bends back, as far as I know that’s what thumbs do, apart from her fucked up thing. So then we were talking about psychological stuff, like why I don’t tell her how I feel. I tried to explain that I only tell my true feelings to those I feel closest to. But I don’t she really picked up on the fact that I don’t tell her stuff therefore she can’t be close. I think she began to get the message when she was going about how opposites (us) attract and I argued they didn’t. I said you need a good mixture of similarities and differences for a good relationship. I then went on to say that we basically have no similarities. I know it sounds really nasty but I hope she goes home to night and feels really bad, stupid, and starts crying or something. God, I’m really callous, but that’s what the silly cow does to me. I do not like her as a girlfriend and I’m now starting to realise that I would also hate her as a friend.
