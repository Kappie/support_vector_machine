I could get real bored and just start taking away all you guys' rights, or even kick you off the site, or just rewrite all ur posts to read stuff like "I-I like jello...jello's cool...I mean, it's good...it's ok. But..baked beans... they just rock.  Ever had like...a can, you roast it...of baked beans...over like a fire, slow roasted over dried cow dung? That's good, beans are like, tasty, like parkas." Obviously that would be bad.  Anyway, now that I have no power, I feel much better about all this.  Things are getting pretty weird for democrats in Texas. Seems that republicans now have the power and are trying to redistrict Texas so as to give the republicans the upper hand. To prevent this, democrats from that state have gone to New Mexico, to avoid being redistricted, a trend that's been goin' on for some time. Let's hope that the democrats get back into power, not just in Texas, but in the federal gov't too.  I'm Deadinside, and it's obvious I had nothing to say for today.  "Register Green, vote democrat!"
