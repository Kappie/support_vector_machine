Then I write and english final on Monday and a math final on Tuesday.)    MRI is the use of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to produce electronic images of specific atoms and molecular structures in solids, especially human cells, tissues, and organs.  Now, basically, it is like a CT scan where you slide into the massive tube and lay there while they... scan you.  So, I did some research on the topic as I like to know what I am getting myself into so that I can empower myself.  I learned about it from  urlLink WebMD .  One thing I had heard of  (from Morgan)  was that you need an injection.  Now, I am not afraid of needles, but I have had my fair share lately.  Giving blood, hooked up to IV's for surgery and my mono/meningitis near death experience, and many for my spinal tap... :|  (Note to self: Do not get spinal tap)   So, I have come to the conclusion that I hate the "hype" about needles, dentists, surgeries, etc.  I sit and think too much and scare myself crazy.   urlLink WebMD , told me that sometimes 'Contrast material  (Is a substance used to make specific organs, blood vessels, or types of tissue, such as tumors, more visible on X-rays. Contrast material may also be used during a CT scan, an ultrasound, or an MRI scan) may be injected into your knee joint. To reduce discomfort, the technologist may inject local anesthetic into your joint before the contrast material. Then additional MRI scans are done.'  Needle in my knee... NO THANK YOU!    Reason this MRI is taking place is during my recovery, at physio, a lump of 'mass' was noticed on the back of my knee up around the hamstring.  I showed Dr. Bering (my knee specialist) and he was not sure of this so wanted it to get checked out.  My doctor got me in early in Medicine Hat as there is a long waiting list in Saskatoon.  I told Diane Greenlay, my physio therapist, this and she said I was lucky.  "Consider yourself lucky, only cancer patients get this special treatment."  :/ Ah... excuse me?  I have cancer on my leg, fantastic!  I do not think that is what have gathered there, more that my doctor has an interest in me and is curious to what it is.  I had the MRI appointment booked at 2:15 PM in Medicine Hat and was to arrive at 1:30 PM.  I walk into the visual diagnostics waiting room after being sent all over the hospital from waiting room to waiting room.  A nurse led me into another room and asked me some questions.  It was from a form which I had filled about when I had my staples removed.  The questions consisted of, if I had metal in my eye, or any new surgeries, etc.  She also asked what kinda of music I liked.  I just said something current.  I didn't want to be picky and say, "Punk!".  Then a bald guy, maybe early 20's comes over.   "Doctor Pain is in the house," he says.   I am like... "Uh oh,"  :|    "Just kidding," he says.  He sits down, "Wait, the lady earlier told you you'd be getting a needle right?"   "Yes," I reply with. "OK good.  I hate it when I come over, 'Oh by the way, here comes a needle!'." the brute man stated.  "Do you have those big gushy veins?" "Ah... I am not too sure," I replied. He straps the rubber band thing around my upper arm and says, "OH YEAH!  That's what I like."  How can one get excited over such a thing?  Must be a medical thing... :S  "Don't worry, it's not a big needle, it won't hurt.  I will put an IV in, but it's not like the rigid needle it will be a soft tube.  Like this,"  flicks some tape that will be used to told the IV in place.  "OK good.  But I wouldn't know what is considered a 'big' needle, I don't look." "OK, just look away then.  Here's alittle poke."  Jabs the needle through my epidermis blood squirts into my eye!  OK, over dramatic.  Didn't feel a thing.  Then he left a needle thing attached to my arm which contained the contrast material.  "This part is cool.  You gotta watch this.  Now... are you a bleeder?"  He pulls the needle thing out and some of my blood is dilluted into the needle's canister.   (Don't exactly know the terminology)     I removed my metal items, watch, chain, belt and buckle.  I also left my debit card and license as the machine can 'zap' them.  Also left bunnyhug, hat, and other pocket items.  I walk towards the room the man says, "After your done you get this!" He holds up a huge, thick needle, with the liquid running down the tip.  I look towards the nurse knowing he's joking as she shakes her head and leads my into the room with the MRI machine.  (See MRI picture below)   I was layed down on the table.  My knee was strapped down and in a plastic tube thing.   (Also in MRI picture below)   I was then slide into the machine upto about my shoulders.  I could still see the ceiling.  I was given headphones and the lady nurse left me with the panic button and said the scans would begin in a few minutes.  I sit there and wait for my music.  Lady comes on, "Oh, I picked out Now 6 for you."  I laugh to myself and think sarcastically, 'Nice choice...'.    I sat for a few more minutes when the man came on and said, "Ah... I am gonna get you a better CD... something you will actually like."  I laugh and give a thumbs-up to the window behind me that they watch me through.  The scans began.  The MRI machine is very loud and 'clunky'.  I could hear it over my music.  They did about 10 minutes of scans  (Seemed like 10 minutes, I had no track of time.)   Then they told me they'd come in and give me my injection.  The nurse and the man walk in and play around with my IV for abit while I listen to my music.  They are talking to me and I can't really hear them just kind of nodding and smiling.    "You might feel a cold feeling and a taste in your mouth," the man says, "Anything?"   I shake my head 'No'.  I did feel a very slight cold tingle up my arm for about 2 seconds but nothing serious. "OK, cool," he says.  They leave and continued the scans.  I was worried my knee would get sore because of the metal screws inside but there was nothing.  My feet and knee did get sore but I think it was because they never moved the whole time.  Also, I was looking for the pain too I think.  So the experience was fine.  I'd do it again.  I just hate the 'hype'.    I got out where my parents were waiting.  They said I was gone for an hour and ten minutes.  I was surprised it took so long.  I then went and got two x-rays of my knee, doctors orders.  This MRI was also a good way to see how the knee is recovering, the graft, ligaments, etc.    That is my adventure for the week.  I sure have experienced alot with this knee.  Seen things most people wouldn't.  I have more stories for the grandchildren as my mother says.  So, I thought I'd share this situation with everyone so that if they ever need one, not to worry like me.   urlLink    MRI
