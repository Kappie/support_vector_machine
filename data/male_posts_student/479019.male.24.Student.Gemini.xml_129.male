It's hard to believe 4 years have passed since we all lived together in Middle Earth. Now we're almost all graduating, or graduated. It was a bit surreal walking through Middle Earth to meet up with some of the folks... since I instantly thought about what it was like when I first got to UCI. Anyway... we all ended up going to BJ's and then hung out at Hoa's. It was really cool.  I wonder if I should get a haircut before graduation tonight?  ***
