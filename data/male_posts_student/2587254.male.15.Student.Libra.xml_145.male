It was typical Sunday I guess + some other things occuring....like today I got a new pair of glasses to replace the pair I broke on Friday =P. YAY I'M NOT BLIND NO MORE! Lol. Other than that it was usual SC, h/w, and MSN. Argh my life seems more drab as it goes by during the school year. Ugh hurry up and come faster.....Stupid June *shakes fist.* Thinks it's so great hiding behind May.......waaaaargh! Anyways though enough about rambling about how June's hiding....  I awoke this morning to the sound of cheesy radio music emitting from the radio downstairs. Ugh stupid 101.3......the channel that everyone over 40 seems to enjoy. Argh....so forcing myself out of bed....I finally get out, head downstairs, and you know the usual routine by now after 108 entries. So after doing all that, I pick up my bag, and head for the car. Only had to drive to Lina's today since Carmen was giving Jason a lift. So left a bit later, picked up Lina, and then headed for church...  At church today....we did what a church should do I believe.....have a Mother's Day service =P. Yeah today's service talked about how moms have done so much for us in the past, and how we should honour them *and of course our fathers.* It's a good reminder. Repetitive things can benefit on the occassion..and this is one of them. So today during service being half blind wasn't TOO bad. Got a seat in front row....but did the slide shifting which isn't smart when you don't have glasses since I can barely see the words lol. Service also started late because Gavin snapped a guitar string, but things went underway pretty quickly after gettin' that fixed. So service today was rotating around mother's day... and it went by fairly quickly today. After service though....wow most Anti-Gavin guitar bashing I've ever heard courtesy of Victor and Vince lol.  "GEEZ LEARN A BETTER STRUM PATTERN" "PLAY SOMETHING OUT OF G" "YOU KNOW GUITAR'S HAVE MORE MUSIC VARIETY THAN THAT" "YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR STRUM PATTERN IS? THE OASIS PATTERN!"  So while being bashed by these "critics," I went on putting away the projector and stuff, while Gavin was packing his things and simultaneously being ridiculed by the Fung brothers lol. Then we headed downstairs and ate some stuff before class started...  Class consisted of finishing up book of Jonah. First thing Pastor Dale asked us was what we think is a "right" form of anger. After using the example of Jesus getting mad at the merchants selling stuff in front of the church *as the church is a place of worship....not to sell stuff* we then went on about our personal ones. I said hypocrites....and then went on about the theory of how lots of people think they're so "ghetto" when the silver chain they have around their neck is worth more than a house block in say......Harlem. "Ghetto gangstas" for sure...lol makes me laugh though when I see FOB gangstas lmao. Lol gangstas with the poorest command of english I've seen in my life lol. Funny stuff....especially at Pac Mall seeing them lol. Anyways.....Vince and Victor went on with the "Gavin sucks on guitar" routine and the other came up with their own things. Anyways we finished the book after some discussion, and then communion. Then we got home.  Home......hmm today went to get glasses after lunch, came back for some SC, then went back out to pick them up....then more SC lol. After that though sat around for a bit, drummed, ate, talked to Jenn and some others on MSN for a bit....and then did the most weird thing I've done in a while:  Internet games. Somehow me, Lina and Jason got hooked on Yahoo! Pool lol. So played that for over an hour, with dinner, and fiddling with my new cell phone......and stuff. Ugh my eyes are killin' me though now....new prescription for new glasses I still gotta get used to. Oh yeah and some InkLink with Lina earlier before Pool lol. Anyways though...  I'm out for the nite.  Later.
