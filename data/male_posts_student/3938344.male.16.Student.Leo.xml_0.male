Before this, I was just content to listen to the radio.  No longer.  With this CD, I started a collection that will be treasured and eventually either passed down to my children or sold on ebay when it gets expensive (either way).  Anyway, the songs I heard on the radio by Shinedown were sufficient enough to make me actually want to buy the album.  This review is of the original release, not of the excellent rerelease (I am getting that one too, if only to get my grubby little hands on "Simple Man" and to see the 45 video).    This CD rocks from the first track to the last, easy and simple.  Their most prominent feature is the incredible vocal talents of Brent Smith, their lead and only singer -- any vocal effects on this album, the harmonies, the backup singing, any of that, is done by him.  They also have a relatively good guitarist, bassist, and drummer, but their main thing going for them is Brent Smith.  Now, onto the song-by-song:  1) Fly from the Inside Solid stuff.  This was their first hit, and for good reason!  This is easily one of my favorite songs by them.  Good, unique intro, awesome singing and lyrics, great harmony on the prechorus between the lyrics and general singing, good screaming bridge, and awesome bass and drums.    2) Left Out A much, much darker song, but still excellent.  Good guitaring, alright lyrics and vocals, and bass and drums that blend seamlessly in make this song of revenge and abuse an excellent addition to the album.    3) Lost in the Crowd This song illustrates the lyric-writing talent of Brent Smith.  He manages to take an otherwise average song and give it incredible new life.  This one got more than a few repeats by me before I actually comprehended the lyrics.    4) No More Love I'm still not sure why this one didn't make a hit.  Awesome guitaring, great singing and lyrics, and a good, faster-paced tempo make this one indispensable.  5) Better Version I absolutely love this song.  It speaks complete truth, that no one is perfect and people should just accept each other for what they are.  Great lyrics, vocals, guitaring, and bass, and some incredible harmony near the end.    6) Burning Bright A slower song, this band manages to pull it off really well.  Great lyrics as usual (that must be getting really repetitive, but it's completely true), pretty good instrument sounds, everything you need for a good song.  And with a new version of this song coming with the rerelease, even better.    7) In Memory Most bands crap out at about this point in the album, but Shinedown's still kicking.  Great intro (I don't know how they did that), a different feel, and incredible lyrics make this my favorite song on the album.  That is, until I get the rerelease and I get my fingers around "Simple Man"...  8) All I ever Wanted An easy second (or third) to "In Memory", this one has a softer feel right up until the chorus, where it unleashes some of the most kickass lyrics ever.  Second to "In Memory" and "Simple Man", that is.    9) Stranger Inside Meh.  Not a very memorable song.  Average lyrics, guitar, bass, and drums.    10) Lacerated Wha happen?  We went from 60 to 3 in 10 seconds, because we hit a proverbial brick wall with this song.  This would be average if it weren't THIS band.  Shitty lyrics, unnoticeable instrumentation.  The only saving grace of this song is that you can skip it if you're using a CD player.  The curse of the shitty song on the awesome rock album strikes again.  11) Crying Out There we go, temporary insanity's over and we're back on track, pumping out hits.  Great intro, kickass everything, and a bridge that startled the hell outta me with just how random it was (but it fit so perfectly!) A great second to last song.  12) 45 And we're here, standing on the edge with this song about suicide.  It's not bad, but these songs are not my favorites.  They're way too disturbing.    This CD is a normal length (47 minutes), so that's not an issue, but there's more to it than that.  Now, mind you, this is only the normal version.  With the rerelease (which came out July 15), you get all this, their "Simple Man" cover (Skynyrd song - bass - drums + Brent Smith = best cover ever), a different version of "Burning Bright", the acoustic 45, and the 45 video, along with the normal CD and the "Fly from the Inside" video.  What else could you ask for? Go forth, my children, and buy this.  Now.  Right now.     Report Card  + Awesome lyrics + Great instrumentation + Variety like all hell + Simple. Man. What else do you need? + Just get the fucking thing already!  Grade: A.  A big, solid A.  Nothin' but.  If this band doesn't survive long enough to put out at least 2 other albums, someone's going to die.
