It's a brief little adventure.  An e-mail from our first-year-lawyering workshop instructor regarding the professor and class on Monday -- "Also, I know that there has been some discontent about the amount of FYL work you have.  [The professor] is aware of it, too, and he will address the issue in the lecture on Monday."  Should be entertaining to hear.  Frankly I'm sick of people complaining about the work -- it's a pass-fail course, and everyone passes.  It's really not that brutal.  Doesn't one give up the right to complain about schoolwork when they go to Harvard Law School?
