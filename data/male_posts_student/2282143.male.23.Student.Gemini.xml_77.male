I didnt know if she was even going to be there or if she was going to be excited to see me or whatever.  At the door Im greeted by a kiss and a "You're nuts..."  Mission accomplished.  I had a nice night even though we did homework and it was just so great to spend the night with her.  Last time I was up there was two months ago.  Too long.  Too long...  I cut her grass then left this morning, taking her toothpaste with me.  Why?  I dunno.  Accident, but sounds funnier if I make it sound like I took it for a reason.  Im just stupid.  Oh well.  Made it all the way to class in nearly 3 hours and was on time.  SUCKS THAT WE DIDNT GET STARTED UNTIL 1:20.  I hate my teacher for that.  If Im gonna haul ass to get there, we might as well get going on time.  Really... how annoying...  On the bright side, I did get my project done so now I have no lab stuff to do for the rest of the year.  I can live with that.  So yeah, Im just really excited for the weekend now.  As hectic as its going to be, it should be a phenominal time.  Tonight, off to Tae Kwon Do and the black belt class.  Should be a late one tonight.  Dad says he has a project for me when he gets home too at 10:30.  Im a bit curious.  Maybe I should take a nap before I go.  Lots of driving today.  Oh yeah, I love my little brother.  Just cause he is cool.
