Firstly, on Tuesday I went to Steve’s house with nonnesuch, megatrobe and deutsches. ‘Twas quite a fun day (well, it beats dickybod’s slave labour thing he had to do :)  ); in which we played monopoly (original version – no Star Wars fancy what-not) and also on the Gamecube, which was quite fun. Unfortunately nonnesuch won monopoly, by getting hotels on the reds and oranges, although I only came in third place out of 5, so not all bad. I even had several houses on Mayfair and Park Lane, but it only really paid off once, when Dave landed there, and went bankrupt. It wasn’t enough to cover what I had to pay on the Oranges and Reds though. Steve was out next, then me, then Jon. But I did ok.   During this game, and after, we played on the Gamecube consol. Mainly Smash Brothers (a fighting game) and Mario Kart (Racing). I did pretty badly at both, as I don’t have one at home, but neither does nonnesuch, so we did about the same. I also got a go on a Sonic game, which wasn’t all that good.   And finally, we had some fun taunting someone from school by the name of ‘Paul’. It was great fun, especially when Dave and Richard played him at Generals (a war game), and he gave up :) We then taunted him over MSN for a while, and then played ‘You are an Arse’ to him several times, to our hilarity. More Gamecube and a thunderstorm later it was time for us to go home. I walked the little way home, and didn’t do much for the rest of the evening.  Then yesterday me and dad went to Currys in Catoford to take another look at fridges (thrills) but I also got a look in PC world, but there wasn’t much of a selection of computers there. I will get a new one sooner or later. Hopefully.  And then this morning I went to Sainsburys with my sister, and bought a bit o’ food for the coming days. Fun, fun, fun.  I haven’t been doing a lot else; I cleaned my room yesterday, and I’ll probably finish tidying it later. I’ve also been reading more LOTR; Isengard has just been flooded, and Merry and Pippin have told their long-winded story of how it was done. And yesterday I spent about an hour learning Esperanto, which means I am now on lesson 5 out of 10 – Question words. I haven’t really learnt them yet though.  And lastly, I watched a film called 'One Eight Severn' last night, staring the guy who played Mace Windu (Samuel L Jackson). 'Twas about him (a teacher) being stabbed, moving to a new school, and then making even more enemys, killing one of his enemies, and then killing himself in russian roulette with his other enemies. His arch enemy also killed himself in russian roulette. What a depressing film.  That shall be all for now, Bye all.     Weather:   Storm on Tuesday, hot and sunny since then  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves (Still)  Listening to:  Star Wars trilogy soundtrack - Imperial March  Watching:  Fraiser earlier, 187 last night  Confused about:  How the top of a cupboard gathers so much dust  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  Good
