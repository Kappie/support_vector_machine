The first two modules that I will be doing is basic then advanced Wireless and internet network applications. Just from browsing thru the books I see stuff like xTML, bluetooth programming, WAP content procedures and many other stuff... Basically its all the things that I like to read up on from time to time as an interest/hobby. There is a certain joy when you find yourself having to study something that you have lots of interest in and enjoy doing. I'm sure there are many people who have had this sensation while in Secondary school or Poly/JC. I'm very happy for you and I hope that you will be able to make a fullfiling career out of it. For I believe that getting paid for doing something that you love should be a major goal in anyone's life.   As for me, I don't think I have ever felt so excited about studying ever, and to me, this is the first time I'm feeling the sensation that I talked about above. I hope it last. Hope it doesn't fade away once I get into the bare bones of the subjects and start to find it dry. This especially happends during exam period. Anyway I'm praying for the best. I will keep the blog up to date with my progress as I embark once again in education.   "What was once old is made new again"   >
