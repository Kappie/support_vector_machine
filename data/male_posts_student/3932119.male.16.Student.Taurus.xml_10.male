No one was there. Then I went down the street to my house. No one was there. I had heard they moved the skatepark close to town hall mostly to discourage stoners from clogging up the park. Town hall. No one was there. Does everyone just magically disappear on Wednesdays or something? Yes, Bridgman is working its evil on me. First, I'm starting to like Emo ( which is socially unacceptable ). And second I have nothing better to do than to post on my useless blog.  Does anyone know if Live Journal has free photo hosting? I need to know the answer for my quest to discover what is truly better, blog or live journal. Live Journal seems like more of a pain when trying to get started, but odes it give free photo hosting? I dont know. Anyone interested in anthropomorphism?    Song of the Day:  "A Grain of Salt" by Poison the Well
