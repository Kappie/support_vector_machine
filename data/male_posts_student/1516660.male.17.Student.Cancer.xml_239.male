Hmm...today morning was the same old same old for Saturday. Eat breakfast then watch cartoons. Moo meow!!  Hm, WQ invited me to go shopping. Well, window-shopping at least. I invited YH to join us la. We met at 2 at Woodlands Interchange and took the South-bound train to Dhoby Ghaut Station. Along the way, I read my book (B Movies, Blue Love. Nice book leh! I wanna go borrow another book of the author's, All About Men).   We arrived at Dhoby Ghuat and made our way towards Plaza Singapura. Oh my!! It was a freaking nightmarish walk. People are giving away leaflets right and left. I am not taking any, because I don't want to contribute to world litter. I have to keep rejecting. Ergh!   The first thing we went into Plaza was go to Carrefour. YH brought sushi and a a bottle of coke. We went out to let him eat first. HaHa. That silly YH says he will only drink 5 cups (a very little cup he got from eating free food in Carrefour) of Coke per hour. HaHa. I helped him pour out the coke. (Once, I accidentally tipped the bottle and quite a lot spiled out. YH brought Coke Light, so he said "See la! Now the coke is really light after you spilled!" HAHA!) After that, we went into Carrefour to look at other sutff. Oh god! There are so many CDs I wanna buy!   After that, we walked around Plaza. Hann wants to buy bag and wallet. Plaza has no shops to his liking, so we decided to go Orchard to shop for his stuff. On the MRT, we saw this advertisement for Navy: "Stories For Your Grandchildren. Start Collecting Now". Ha! Me and Hann commented that joining the Navy, you MAY NOT survive to have grandchildren in the first place! HA!!! Navy/Armed Forces = Violent/Dangerous = Loss of Precious Life.   We went down at Orchard, and went to Isetan. We saw this Billabong wallet YH wanted, but he said he wanted to do survey first, shop around. We went out and saw Kym Ng!! She was there filming for Quan Xing Zhou Dong Yuan (forgot the English name le). O.o!! While walking towards the Heeren, I decided to go home. I wanna rush back to watch "8 Simple Rules For Dating My Daughter". I reached home at around 6.  Hmm...watched that show and Ok No Problem! HaHa! The Zheng and Lai families got back together, Ah Lian finally got David, Ah Long's monetary problems are solved and the Mother came back! HaHa! Such a happy show!   Today hor, Mo Wan Wan came to 768 leh! However, as much as I like WanWan, I didn't go. Why? Because, I want to watch Ok No Problem!! Besides, I haven't finish eating my frog legs. Hm.  I think I end liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
