"do you require lots of light when you study?" and later on "do you like studying with lots of light" and "do you like studying in cold weather" ann later on "do you study best in cool environment".. sooo frustrating.. and during the lesson.. they gave the reports of our survey.. and the trainer like went.. if your reports say that you need a lot of light to study.. you should turn on your study lamp at home... sooo lame man.. and they have no common sense at all.. sigh.. we paid 60 bucks for this man.. haiz.. such a waste of time and money..     anyway.. looking forword to church on sunday.. haha... yay.. jars of clay is really good!! i need to learn html.......     Amazing Grace     I grew this heart into a drifter  i never felt the roots i bear  i sold my sight, oh brother, sister  for a mountain of fool's gold, its gone  only God knows God knows where    my sould was restless for redemption  my feet were lookin' for a place to stand  well i ain't got no life  and you know i ain't got no money  just the faith of an empty hand    amazing grace i feel you coming up slowly now  like the sun is risin', heat on my face  oh love that keeps on shinin'  dont let the shadow come  ya know i gotta feel your healin' rays    i hitched a ride, i was a beggar  i had murder on my hands  i need water to rinse these stains  but only blood could remove what's spillin'  and pardon me the blame
