Possibly the worst musician I've ever heard (that goes for counting all the toddlers I've heard playing "In the Jungle" on their Playskool 5-bell keyboards) got rejected from every college he applied to... Like shitty colleges... West Chester.... now he has to go to DCCC.... now I'm not one to seriously smile at the misfortunes of others, but this kid was just such a twat... so I had to make his personal business public in my away message, and then in my blog... Drop me your thoughts... I personally think, just becaus the kid was so full of himself with no reason to be, that he deserves it.  any time I see an away message with a song lyric my immediate reaction is to not look at it... Anyone else like this?  NP (or soon to be playing): Curtis Mayfield- Pusherman, Superfly Barry White- The Best Of Tower of Power- These guys are the funkiest band of all time. Phenominal horn section, excelent vocalists, and the deepest grooving bass player of all time. Creators of Oakland Soul... if you havent heard them you  absolutely have to check them out (What is Hip, Down to the night club [Bump City], Soul with a capital S, You're still a young man, You ought to be having fun, So Very Hard To Go)... I heart this band with every inch of my body... even  my peepee ;-)
