As a result, my poor addled brain, usually deprived of sleep and not that powerful to begin with, rereads the statement created with a comma in it, and instead comprehends the peaceful speed bump of text that should be there as a full blown stop sign, wasting seconds of precious thought. It's not an important thing, but then again, it's not a hard thing to fix either. So get it together Slackware and gaim! I have faith in you!! [/rant]
