Give us Clinton back, and don't say he wasn't a good president, for all you homos out there that hate him just because of Monica, big fucking deal, it's called hormones and yes even the president has them. I mean for crying out loud look at Hillary, and you'll stop wondering why he had sex with Monica. Better that bush. Bush's face is turning more and more into a monkey. Anyways, yesterday was awesome. I slept at Mike's with James and Matt. We put shaving cream on Matt and humped him to death. He ended up going crazy on me and James. He tried to kill me but I put him down in a cop hold with his arms bent behind his back. This morning we persisted to tease him but I started to feel bad especially with that cute face so I stopped, and so did James...sort of. At around 2:30 we went to my house and got Paul, Ricky, Jon R and Jay H to play baseball at Brady park with us. After that, Jay, Jon and Heaton all went home and the rest of us went to Quiznos. Saw Arthus and he told me something so crazy "sicknasty" that if I told you, I'd have to kill you. It's confidential. Also saw Tom Kaiser, and Paul bought me a cookie and made it all cooked and he told the spanish guy to put a pickle in it and he goes "Pickle!? Ok!... Yea I like that shit too!" Haha, he's a funny spanyard. Then I went home. Went to the mall with my mom, got the new Rush FEEDBACK CD and my mom bought the new Aerosmith HONKIN ON BOBO CD with this free harmonica key chain. The price for it was messed up and it was cheaper than the normal version and we got it for 12.99 because they had to because that's what the label said...HA! Mamma also bought me a cinnamon pretzel and we also went to Carvel. Mommy is awesome. Oh yea we also went to Hot Topic and I got a Quagmire shirt and bought my dad an Orange County Choppers shirt for a late Father's Day gift. Ok bye.
