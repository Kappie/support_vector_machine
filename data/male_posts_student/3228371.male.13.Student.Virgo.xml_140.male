On webcam, phone, and MSN with Nima. Haha! He has to go downstairs to dinner but he doesn't want to. Aww... he's such a sweetie but he has to eat! His parents'll get mad. *sighzZ*   Blah... the email from WilaX was sooo freakin long! Hehe! Haven't read a long email since Wilfred's 4 long emails. I think Will's email was longer than Wilfred's emails but then if you count in total, then of course Wilfred's 4 long emails were longest in total! Hehe! Blah...! Wilfred and Will's emails were closest to reality-ish! Other people's advice didn't really come as close to reality as theirs. So if Wilfred and Will are reading this, THANK YOU for giving me GREAT comments and stuff~ ^^ I know what to do now and yeah. Hehe~!  Well, the *cough* problem still remains and I know I can count on Brian to help me out with it! [nooo pressure, Brian!] Haha~!   Blah, I'm gonna blog later... maybe.
