It doesn't matter as it's already passed.. What happen at school? Well.. 2-periods of Design  Technology and 2-periods of Social Studies inside a 16-degrees-celcius IT Room.... Wat The Heck!! No matter... D  T was fine.. Get to touch up on my folio and my workpiece.. Recess.. Yeah..Fight! Between a Malay guy and an Indian guy... Fight over past things.. SMALL things.. How lame and childish is that?! I can't believe it man.. A friend of the "same" guy, broke the glass panel by punching it.. Another foolish thingy.. And after he hit it.. He whines... Wat a wimp... Do stupid things.. Then there's this one Sec. 1 SC.. Damn, f*cking irritating man.. Play with my Dad's name.. I hate that man.. I, myself nearly get myself into trouble.. Luckily for him my friend stops me.. I nearly smack the guy on his face man... What a dickh*ad.. I had an English class after school.. Sat beside Sam.. One thing which I couldn't forget is that my Jenni... She TOTALLY ignored me man... The whole day.. Why?! I'm so bumped out by her actions.. It's like we're strangers and didn't knew each other.. No smile.. Not even a "Hi!".. I'm really, really bumped out today man... It's not the first time she ignored me like this... Nah... She probably don't like me anymore... What to do.. No point of chasing something you can't even catch.. Right? Sounds hopeless.. Anyway.. Tired..Bored (As usual).. I think this is enough for today man... See ya'll tomorrow.. Peace out!!
