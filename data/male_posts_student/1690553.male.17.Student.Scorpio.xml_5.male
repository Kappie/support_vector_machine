I also informed by my IT Teacher that the Information Technology SPM examination will take place on 13th October, much earlier than other subjects which would happen in November. So I will not need to worry about IT in November, a good thing I think. Wish me luck!  Although I'm generally in good mood today, a distrubing bad dream came bugging me last night. It's about a death of a close relative. Hope it just a dream and not a premonition, I can't afford to lose another family member this year.
