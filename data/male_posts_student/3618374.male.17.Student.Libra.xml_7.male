My poor sport of choice is going down the drains for the following reasons: 1) Calgary Flames allowing Craig Conroy to skip to the unrestricted free agent list: Any fan of the Calgary Flames, or anyone who follows hockey, knows this is a terrible idea. Although Craig only scored 8 goals this season, he was out for half of it and he still was one of the top playmakers/assisters in the game. He was one of the reasons why Jarome Iginla was able to score the goals he did. Wherever you looked, there was my pal Craig doing his thing, going into the corners, fishing out pucks for Jarome. What a cool guy. Darryl Sutter, you fucking turdmangler. 2) Todd Bertuzzi getting charged: Sure. Dirtiest hit... ever. Charged him with a 500 000 dollar US fine. Leave him alone. 3) my friend telling me Ray Bourque is not better than Paul Coffey: Okay. Lets compare the two. Ray Bourque is a huge, hard hitting, puckhandling, pokechecking machine. Paul Coffey, although he is fast as lightning and is not bad defensively, he doesn't have the abillity to play in traffic like Bourque does or hit guys like Bourque. I'm always right so fuck you.
