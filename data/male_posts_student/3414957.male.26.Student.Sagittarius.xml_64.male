Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that yesterday, the water fountain I drive by everyday was finally overflowing with suds!!! I was so happy. I laughed my ass off!   So it's 1:24pm and I haven't eaten anything today. I want to get a sub sandwich and then I guess I will come back home and watch a movie (Sopranos probably), then goof around online or something. The weather is alot cooler today so I feel pretty relaxed. I still have the song World Destruction stuck in my head. Oh well, at least it keeps me company.
