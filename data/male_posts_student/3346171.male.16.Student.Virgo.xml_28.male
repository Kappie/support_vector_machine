Got too much hurt this month? That was teaching… Cried too much? The was soul cleaning… Got mad at some people? That was for forgiving them someday Felt lonely many times? It’s because you closed the doors even to the angels… Believed in everything that was lost? It was the beginning of your improvement Where do you wanna get? High? Dream high… Wanted the best of the best… If we think low… Little things we’ll get… But if we wish strongly and Mainly fight for the best The best will install on our life Because I’m the same size of what I want,[ Ain’t the same size of my height." (Carlos Drummond the Andrade)
