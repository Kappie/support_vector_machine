Firstly I would just like to say that the substantial majority of BNP supporters and other nationalists are mindless, ignorant fuckers! Romeo and Juliet people, (Deary me Ash's new video is drab and deplorable, innit?) love and humanity are transcendental of one's creed, colour, nationality and such. Yes, that's right, as if none of you were suspecting that. Also my Mother has a saliently-covered volume of cookie-flavoured conspiracy theories, in the shape of the new David Icke book! Yes, further reptilian conspiracies, hollow earth theorising, globalisation scare stories and turquoise shellsuits! My it's, like the Daily Mail, just with less immigrants! Actually, you've got to respect the guy, even if his ideas and theories are unsubstantiable and outlandish, he's certainly managed to rake in an audience for his collation of ancient myths, turquoise shellsuits, cyber punk and horror stories. So in closure of this update I'd like to big up David Icke, and maybe Pete Townshend too as The Who are magical. Best of fortune to the England team tonight, 'twould be nice if they won. Anyway, toodles.  Mood: Loopy, like Kellogs Fruit Loops Music: The Who - Saturday Nights Alright for Fighting; The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Emit Remmus; The Killers - Jenny was a friend of mine; Enigma - Sadness (Part 1)  This update sponsored by Kellogs Fruit Loops, Versace, JD Sports and Bertelsmann Music Group. Don't you just love multinational companies, and commercialism in general? I know I don't.
