Second conversation was a little harder.  I had to tell Tina that I still loved her*damnit* and that didn't go so smoothly.  First, I thought it might work, but then just like in Mean Girls, there was the word vomit.  The words just kepy coming out, until I was a huddled mass on the sidewalk crying my eyes out because I love her so much, but there's nothing I can do about it.  I'm just a messenger, my feelings don't matter.  As long as other people are happy, I shouldn't give a damn. THEN WHY DOES IT HURT SO MUCH!!!  Then our conversation was cut short because her ride had arrived.  She gave me a hug though, that was the warmest hug I've ever had...maybe because of my cold heart and soul...  Then I get home and have a WONDERFUL conversation with Tascha about the whole thing.  First she wondered why I was in such a bad mood.  Then asked me why I was so hooked on Tina.  Then accused my penis for it, which I don't believe is true.  Then I got angry....now I'm talking to Brittany about being "shattered" and I'm getting more pissed.  Man, nothing is goin' right...  Spense
