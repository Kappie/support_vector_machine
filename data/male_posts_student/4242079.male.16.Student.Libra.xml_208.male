RadioShack raised the wages of everyone in my district, to $7.00 an hour plus commission. That should help. But still, I don't want to make the same as everyone else. I want to make more.  Last night: Mark, Kendra, Alex, Me. Blarney Stone South. Lots of good music, and excellent wings. Tipped the waitress 8 dollars. On a $32.32 bill. I will not be known as stingy. Dress pants make you spend more, anyway.  Alex: New girl at work. A PoliSci student. Seems to have half a brain. Nice girl. Did not expect her to accept the invitation to come out for a drink. Surprised.  This morning: Tired, neck hurts. Fell asleep on book last night. Crumpled book. I've been trying to read this one since Christmas. Mother woke me up this morning to ask if I had replaced headlight in car yet. Headlight has been burnt out for the better part of a year. My mother is crazy. Literally.  Mark: Going to set up my wireless network on Friday? Marks a good guy.  Work: Unfulfilling.  Adrienne: Should call  Bryce: Should call  Robyn: Should call  Breakfast: Cereal. Again.
