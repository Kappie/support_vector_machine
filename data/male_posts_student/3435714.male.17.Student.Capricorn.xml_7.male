So i got my friend Josh, my two brothers,  I together...and we're gonna be a band known as "Under War Torn Skies." I came up with the name, its from the whole Cold War period of history, when everyone  their dog feared nuclear death,  spy planes we're  tearing back  forth like crazy. The name has a lot to do with that.    The band will consist of Levi @ Lead Vocals, Ethan @ Drums, Me @ Guitar  growling,  last but not least Josh @ Bass  Backup Vocals. Knowing what my brothers  I listen to, plus adding in all the stuff that Josh listens to(mostly stuff I eventually end up liking cuz he plays it all the time) our band will be pretty heavy.   It will have a lot of influence from bands such as: Metallica, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, KoRn, Godsmack, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana, Static-X,  Seth Amens poetry, Levi's poetry,  our emotions.   So it should be pretty awesome, i'll post more updates as everything progresses, And as my closer before I end this journal: "Seth thank you so much for the inspirations, you truly have a hardcore heavy metal soul, i can see it in your writing, you have some serioussly wicked talent. Dont ever lose that, or let anyone or anything take it away from you, You are the Greatest my man."
