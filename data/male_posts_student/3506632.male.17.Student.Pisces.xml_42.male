Today the admission test of GIKI was so pathetic that I completed it in 30% time and I see no reason of how it can rank students by merit. It's design suggested it was to see how lucky one can be during writing the alphabets without a mistake. I think after this test and the reports I have heard about other tests, that all the hue and cry about NUST's test being ill-conceived is just a cry when people fail. At least the end of the tests mean I get rid of the copious restrictions I get for not studying.
