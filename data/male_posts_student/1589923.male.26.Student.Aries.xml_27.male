Maybe there is still a bit of hope left.... How honest and truthful are we to our partner? trust is the foundation of all relationship... without trust, the relationship is good as dead. I have no idea why i have reached this sort of state. a state whereby sometimes i live in fear, insercurities creeping up to me. I don't remember me being this way in the beginning. Why? why have i become this way? sometimes i dun know what to believe... my instinct or my rational thinking. I guess along the way, everything is all messed up, entangled within the other.. i can no longer tell the difference apart. Seriously... i hate feeling this way and i wish there is something that can make it go away. i wish someone could help me, relieve me of this agony. My god... it's one of those days again. Will anyone be there for me?
