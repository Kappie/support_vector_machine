Well, my girlfriend Brittany had a huge surprise for me she has been planning for a while, with a romantic dinner she cooked just the two of us, presents, dancing, and all kinds of things. It was so sweet. She and her aunt picked me up at 3:00, and I got home about midnight. It was so cool.   Anyway, here is what I have to ask everyone: The Dixie Chicks left country music because they are "supported by the genre," in the words of Martie, the steel guitarist/banjo player. Now why on earth would the "F.U.T.K." girls think that? Did they think nobody saw the "Without Me" video and the Entertainment Weekly cover? What do you think? Country music is supposed to be more wholesome.  In Christ, Mike  "Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord." - Psalm 27:14 NIV
