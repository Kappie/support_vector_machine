Our group was quite large this time and newcomer Audi had an amazing last round.  Bill managed a few strong rounds along with Mike and Cassie.  Sarah managed to fall on the floor of the bowling alley only to get up and give hell to the pins.  Nice work done by all, the Slashmaster needs to pull it together though.
