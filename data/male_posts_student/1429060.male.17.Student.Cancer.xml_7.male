Today is rather a sad day, for my neighbors had to take their aged dog to the vet and have him put down. It was merciful to the dog, because he was steadily growing blind and he had several health conditions that caused him much pain. In addition, he was quite old, which made the health conditions even more dangerous. They put the dog down this morning, unless I am mistaken.   Wandering in a world of death and pain The society no longer wants emotion Feelings pump into the brain like living blood “Don’t show them, damn bastard It’s just a stupid feeling We do live in a time of inconvenience, you know” They was in self-convinced Reassurance Martyrs to themselves because they stay silent A heavier load upon the their shoulders each time They refuse to cry They refuse to speak Among the first to feel the emotional flood As it breaks the wall of the mind A torrent for long held within a feeble grasp They don’t cry, they don’t speak They’re in a mental institute now. Crystals forming upon the breeze Flowing The quartz is still a living organism too Unable to feel any emotion Save sadness, pain, agony It crawls down the cheeks from the eye corners Flies away on a zephyr before it touches earth The hosts from whence it came They feel They are upset over the world Pain and death that stole from their hearts Their minds weeping The emotional dam allowing a trickle A tear splashed upon the soil A life worth more than imposters of feelings.   Comment freely on this poem or the current state of affairs in your existence. If you were the friend of a canine who has passed away, then you must know how the trouble of this impacts your mind like the blow of a hammer.
