There wasn't any range at the course, so we went to the course next door to hit balls. So then I started playing... I'll start with the big important summary, then go into details and analysis. I shot a 91, 45-46. So-so, I probably would have shot below 85 if I had played at winnetka (you'll see why). I had one birdie and three triples (ugh). The thing that really brought me down was my putting. I took 40 lousy putts. Actually, only 22 were lousy, because 18 went in, but... 8 three putts if you count putting from the fringe, Five of them I was on the green in reg. for. I took 22 putts on the nine holes on which I hit the green in regulation. my one birdie was on the 11th hole over water where I stuck a nine-iron to a foot. the greens were big, and my shots weren't going close to the pin, but still. I am still glad with my nine greens but my putting was atrocious. seven out of 14 fairways to go along with that, I was driving the ball pretty well. I lost two balls to the water hazards, one off the tee on the par five fourth, and one on a duck hook approaching the tenth green. I figure that if even I cut all my tripples to doubles, and make half of my three putts into two putts I would have a 84, which would not be bad at all. I figure that for my two oclock tee time tomorrow, I should leave at 12 oclock, hit a half bucket over at the other course (I warmed up really quickly this morning) and then go and putt a lot over at Steeple Chase. I got a ride hame from Ed Traines who shot an even 72 and should be in good position going into tomorrow to make it into the match play on wendesday. I went home, had lunch then cooled down at the pool. I really like Steeple Chase because its wide open and nicely done (except on the greens which were inconsistent). Tell more tommorow.
