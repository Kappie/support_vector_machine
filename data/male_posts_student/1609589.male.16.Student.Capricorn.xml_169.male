Food poisoning?  Group dynamix was uber fun, but I only wish I had more stamina than i do X-P  Ugh, throwing up is NOT fun. Neither is PE, which I have tomorrow. I'm still sore from group dynamix(i had about as much workout at group dynamix as i have had in PE the entire year)  I'm supposed to be doing this shit history homework, but i'm not. It's vocabulary, and I don't know what I'm gonna do, because my laptop doesnt like the internet at home, and my home computer is not liking search engines for some reason right now. Prolly has to do with that Qhosts virus. I'll figure it out sooner or later.  About viruses- if you ever see someone's profile with WWW.REALPHX.COM in reeeal big and bold letters, tell them to talk to me, and DON'T CLICK THE LINK!  It is the stoopidest virus thing ever. IM me if you want me to tell you how it works.  I spent upwards of 3 hours working on a virus i didnt have, because it was so simple... stoopid.  It was monday night, at like 9, and i thought "Oh crap, i have english homework!" so I spent two hours making a flash amination of a stick figure who feeds his baby laxatives accidentally instead of milk. I love cartoons.  :-O i dont think i did my math homework! Oh, yes i did.    Hmm... what else... hmm...  I missed jay and alex's lan. Sorry, I was sick out of my mind that day, I couldn't even stand up until like 8 PM.
