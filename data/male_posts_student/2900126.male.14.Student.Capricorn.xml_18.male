It was fun my mom and my aunt we're chaperones and they were really fun and they said they had a nice time and so did I. I went on "The Raging Bull" for the first time today it was really awesome. My mom she was all scared of all of the roller coasters so she did get on any but we got alot of prizes when we played games. Yeah so all in all we had alot of fun.  So yeah i discovered like three days ago from my friends sonya that I'm body-conscious. Yeah I think I'm fat and everybody is all not you're not but they don't see what I see in the mirror in the morning. But yeah I want to lose some more weight over the summer and yeah well I guess I g2g.                                                                            For all of you reading this stop laughing or I will have my revenge.
