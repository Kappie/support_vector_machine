I think USC has several different types although I'm not really certain of what each of them is for or if I'm even at the right one.  I'm assuming that I can be here.  I went to the previously described informal lunch of death.  It really wasn't all that bad.  Maybe because not that many people showed up.  But hey, what do I have to do with my time that is more deserving.  Nothing, that's what.      After the lunch I got showed my new desk.  How exciting.  Nothing like being crammed in a space with a few other people.  But I am grateful for the space.  Then I got roped into a meeting.  It was fine, but I wasn't ready for it.. I'm running out of time on this computer, gotta go.
