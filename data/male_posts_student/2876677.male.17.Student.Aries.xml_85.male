He shafted Evan and I today. Didn't show up to the lesson. I wasted time, gas, and money. He should seriously think about growing up, this is not the only time it has happened. Jerkmo.  Anyway about 'kids'. There is something wrong with at least half of the kids ages 5-15, then after that the percentage increases. I was walking through a store today...and this kid was walking towards me next to his mother. Now this kid was 'normal looking', about 14. And by normal I mean black sweatshirt, knee-waisted oversized pants, and in dire need of a haircut and bath (I didn't smell him from where I was, appearances can be a great indication however.) So as he and his dear mother were walking, he started to growl. Growl like a rabid pit bull. I was like, whaaat? --as I move a little faster.  He was sane, if that's what you're thinking, but yes, he was still in fact, growling. I was sketched out and tried to forget it. But then I realized I needed to go back the other way to find my mum, and as I turned around, I caught another glimpse at the nice young teenage boy. He had taken off his ratty baseball hat, wound up, and smacked his mother in the back of the head with it. Hard. And then again. I got scared and ran away. That is the kind of kid who you can share a cupcake with at lunch, then at the next meal he pulls a gun on ya.  I blame it on TV. And drugs. Well, weed and power rangers/pokemon.    Let me hear ya holla, street balla! (leave a comment, basketball player)
