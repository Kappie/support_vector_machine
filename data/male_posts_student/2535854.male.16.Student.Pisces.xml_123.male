Heh..during english Mrs.Rama started yelling at Zainul and told to get outta class..so when he got up she got the wrong person..actually was saying to Mughni in front of class but called him Zainul by mistake :p .Math was perhaps boring a little bit but all fine..Slept in agama as well..so bloody tired now these days..now I am truly becoming a sleep lover though I need coffee now these days very often at very short intervals of time :X .  Anyway didn`t do much when I got home from school..dad`s gone off to Penang on bussiness...so not much food in the house...and Mr.Chang was here for ours just to get interior designing slightly verified :X .So at like 9:30pm or so he left and I was able to go to Burger King and grab dinner for me and my mom...whopper..chicken royale and large fries..yum!  And wow!Portugal have made it through!Hahaha..I say it serves Spain right for dropping Morientes with Fernando Torres when its clear Raul should make way...Valeron didn`t play enough and Xavi didnt play and he was so on form this year for Barcalona!Well to bad for Spain!hahah!Nuno Gomes was a culprit last time wasnt he?Well revenge I guess!And very interestingly Greece is through.I now owe Afandi rm40 instead.If I had bet matches which I didnt...I woulda won through the odds...mother..haha..And like I said I created an LJ for commenting at other people`s sites...ill add the link later along with some other new links.
