I usually do not write anything so soon before any show, but then again, this isn't any show, or any band for that matter. This is Rush, my favorite band of all time, and they're celebrating the big 30. I am so excited, but before I could think about that, I have other things to occupy my mind with. First of all since I am going to LA en route to Manila and leaving for good, I still have a lot of packing to do. I'm not worried about it however. I also have many an errand to run before I could really have fun.   Today (June 29th) is also the nationwide release date of Rush's new CD "Feedback". "Feedback" contains song that have inspired each member of Rush to be who they have become. Rush rarely does any covers, so therefore a CD like this is quite rare indeed. I will pick it up later.  I also realize that this will be my very last week in New Hampshire. Although I know that I'll come back to visit, I realize that it will not be the same. When I first "got sick" of New Hampshire, I never thought I'd miss it like I imagine I will in a few weeks. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and my life in New Hampshire was a great thing. Now, the main theme of my last seven days in New Hampshire is to say goodbye to New Hampshire the right way. Good bye, New Hampshire. Hello Rush, hello LA, and subsequently, hello (again) home!
