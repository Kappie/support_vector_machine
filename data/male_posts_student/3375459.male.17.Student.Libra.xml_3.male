Got my back all wet, I want revenge. Tara! You were lucky, I weren't carrying a bottle of water with me, when I was above you. I guess if you do more of what you did with your sister on that poor chair today, maybe the bees will stop coming. Hmmmm..... I guess everybody did their part, cause we got our job done much much earlier then last year. Ohya, my nails grew longer after peeling those stickers from the boxes, especially the white ones (seems like only the bss boys were doing it). Yada Yada Blah Blah Blah... Mess all cleared up.. Time to line up and get paid! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip HURRAY!! I hid myself away behind two big guards, but still I couldn't smoke away. Was caught by Tara and how can I resist that smile, aRRhhh... There you go, your commission.  Took a bus home, blog, showered, dinner, fruits (durian), blog and I think I should go and have some rest now. Great Day!
