This was one of the DVD's that I wanted most for Christmas, and it has finally arrived. Since my brother and sister didn't have this to give me on Christmas, they compensated for its absence with a  Fight Club  poster. If late gifts mean getting something extra in turn, then I'm always up for late gifts. Thanks Nate and Lindsey!     The Man with No Name Trilogy:    urlLink A Fistful of Dollars     urlLink For  a Few Dollars More     urlLink The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
