"come on and give me my poison."   what have i done.? is it too late to save me from this place? from the depths of the grave? we all are those .. who thought we were brave. what have i done.?  Good song. Deadbolt by Thrice.  tired.  Carl, Tommy, and Jason came over to watch the game.  Got a  little  hyper and blew off a whole bunch of energy.  That's about it.  Seriously quit it with the cunt shit, it's not even funny anymore.  I feel like BLAH.  I want to hang out with people from school that I don't normally hang out with so if you're one of those people IM me and we can work something out.  Going on vacation on Friday, a cruise.  Fun.  I'm just scared I'll be too shy to get to know anyone.  Pistons won, hurrah.  I'm trying to be happy for you but it's not working too well.  It's probably because I have the energy of a pet rock.  I'm out, later
