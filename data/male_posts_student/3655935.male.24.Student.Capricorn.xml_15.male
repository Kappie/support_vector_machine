I hope he keeps blogging now that he’s back in the states.   urlLink God, the World, and Other Things  is an interesting blog that I forced my friend Michael to create. Michael is a good writer, and it’s unfortunate he can’t blog more often.  I especially enjoyed his comments on  urlLink Christians and Tattoos .  (His other blog,  urlLink The Instant of Irony , is about Kierkegaard... check it out too!)  Max Goss, a philosophy PhD student at the University of Texas, authors the blog  urlLink In Hoc Signo Vinces .  I enjoy his sharp cultural and political criticisms.  For more straightforward philosophy check out  urlLink Certain Doubts , an epistemology blog headed up by  urlLink Jonathan Kvanvig  (although it has numerous esteemed contributors).  The  urlLink Prosblogion  is a clever title for a thought-provoking philosophy of religion blog, which I highly recommend.  One of my favorite theological oriented blogs is  urlLink Doug’s Theology Blog .  I think the main reason I enjoy it is his strong anti-Calvinism.  We need more of those...  A blog that simultaneously exhibits creative writing and disturbing stories is  urlLink What’s the Buzz? , authored by one of favorite friends in Abilene.  So these are blogs I checkout everyday, which perhaps says something about me and my choice of friends...  If you haven't looked at these blogs, go check 'em out!
