It was one of those places, like Disneyland and the like, that has an atmosphere of enforced happiness. "We're on holiday! Of course we're happy!" The trouble is that I seem to have an intolerance of these places - for me they have exactly the reverse affect, they just make me miserable. I seem to be the only one left out from whatever magic is in the air, and all I can see is the cynical capitalism driving it all. So needless to say I didn't find it very much fun.  However the weather this time was good. Too good. It was sweltering hot and even taking a sip out of my 70p (rip off!) chilled cola can was exhausting. Everyone in the campsite wandered about like sleepy sloths whilst the sun slapped down upon our burnt backsides. I took a dip in the tiny swimming pool to cool down. A few minutes later my eyes were burning like hell and my hair had the texture of straw, plus, when it had dried my beautiful blond highlights had gone green.  I got out when some kid loudly declared he was going to 'warm' his wetsuit. In other words he pissed in it.  For the rest of the holiday I sheltered in my tent, reading the paper and strumming some chords on my guitar from time to time. I successfully avoided having a 'fun' game of badminton or for that matter doing any physical activity whatsoever, apart from swatting the odd wasp.  When it eventually came to the last day I was so ecstatic that I somehow managed to break the indicator light on my dad's new car. He was furious. The journey home was just one long let's bollock James fest. All my faults were carefully explored and put down in the end to me being a complete idiot.  So let this be a warning to you - don't go camping, it'll always end in tears!
