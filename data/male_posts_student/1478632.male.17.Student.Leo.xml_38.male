It was held at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire. We locals just call it the Verizon. Well last year we placed "42nd out of 42 teams" as Mr Kelly said to the newscaster interviewing him. Today we were in the third place alliance. Woot. Even more interesting than the competition is the award that we won. Ryan Cummings, our programmer, made one of the best efforts I've ever seen or make this robot work. This year he programmed eight different types of codes and constructed a program box to load each of them before each match. For his efforts, we got the Leadership in Programming Award, a very high honor. Just as his luck happens to fall, he left early last night to go to his friend's house. Better than that, I got Woodie Flowers to take one of my bandanas. It took some trying, but it eventually worked out well. I told him to take it and he said "Well, I don't think I can take that, but how about you sign my shirt?" Eventually, I got him to take the bandana. No big deal, right? Well you don't know Woodie Flowers, then. He usually refuses to take things from students because he feels too modest, like we're better than him. Whatever. Even better than that, Over the past three days, I got much closer to my friend Laura. So close, in fact, that we started going out. :) Guess that's all for now. Later. --Jake
