So, I decicded that I would clean the house, like really clean it for her. I did. Well, she gets home, And without even saying "hi", she starts yelling at me for anything and everything that I did not do. Mind you I was so happy that she was home, but, I guess people will never change, and that is OK. She never even says sorry. It's not my fault that her kids steal her shit, and, then, don't bring it back. There is no reason for her to "vent" at me like that. I think that it's great when they say that teens do not know stress. Bullshit, what do you call that??????? ciao.
