Tuesday, was my first time managing at work! It went really well! At first i was kind of scared because i was working with a cook who doesnt take me very seriously and likes to cock off a lot! But that night he was really good, and actually listened to me for once! Around 7 o clock, and only 3 people working, we got pretty hard! We had a $400 hour which is really good and really busy. We made about 6 trays of chicken in one hour! thats a lot of chicken! Nothing went wrong, and i was really glad about that! Wednesday i had to babysit until 4:30 and then me and rachel went to piqua, picked up some guys and went shopping! I was supposed to take my car to be fixed with my dad, but he made plans without asking me first and got mad because i needed my car! He hasnt talked to me since! Oh well, not my loss! After shopping, we drove around, hung out with some more people, and then headed home. Friday night i had to work until close, after work i ran home showered, and headed to sidney, i stayed at a guys house and didnt go to bed until 630 am! it was insane! I was to the point i was bouncing off the walls because i was so hyper from lack of sleep, because the nite before i didnt get to sleep until 3! saturday morning i got up, hung out with some guys at the house, and then it was time for me to head home because i had to be to work at 2. I got to work, pretty boring like normal. i hate working the afternoon shifts because no one wants chicken at 2 in the afternoon! so i sat around and talked to lorynn most of the time. After work, i came home got changed, got picked up by rachel and headed to sidney. We picked up one of my close friends, ben, and headed to piqua. We went to brads house, rachels bf, and paint balled in the pouring down rain! omg was i soaked! after paint balling, laughing our butts off because one guy, andrew, kept sliding through the wet grass while running and falling about five times, we went inside! we hung out there until about 1-1:30 and decided we were all going to go to taco bell. well we got to taco bell, and they were closed! grr! so we had to go to mcdonalds! hah oh well! me and rach dropped off ben and headed home! That brings me to today! I got home about 9:30 this morning and omg was i drained! i was sooo tired! After going to bed 3 am thurs. 6:30 am fri. and 2-2:30 sat. nite, i was beat! So once i got home i hit the couch and slept until 2! I got up got on the net, got ready for work, talked to eric for a bit, and then went to work. we were pretty dead tonite! we closed at 8 and i got out of there at 5 after! I came home, took a shower, and brings me to now! sitting here being bored, so i decided to blog! eric always yells at me that i dont blog! but now look who hasnt blogged in quite awhile! not me! haha! have a good nite! -ash-
