Things were getting pretty dull like the end of the track season, but now it is over and I can enjoy my time off. At least the last day of school was pretty interesting when everyone showed up to find the long hall (which holds like two thirds of the classrooms) trashed by the seniors. Sucks for them because they got grad night cancelled.
