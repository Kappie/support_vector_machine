BUT... How? Would that not indicate another Mr. Anderson on the rise? or was it he was killed to cause Neo to pick the other door, The door to Trinity. They are a great trilogy and I suggest that any sci-fi / fantasy lover watch them, if you have not already, which like half the population of the worldhas. So many puzzles maybe when i finally get to play MATRIX: ONLINE they will be answered. i'll go in search of this Mr. Anderson... If he indeed does exist. Many of ym thoughts may sound ludocrist to many but you are not in my mind so do not criticize me. and questions or comments email me b/c my posts are bein gay..........im me also. BUT...aww forget it...
