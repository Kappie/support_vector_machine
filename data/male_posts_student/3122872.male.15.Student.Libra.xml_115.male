Point bout your complaining bout boredom:  Hello guys ! You both have been/still arein some other place par fromyour freaking bedroom/this country, unlike me who will also have to move to the computer room as my mumattacks my room with paint, hammers and various other letal equiptment, having my stuffburnt in the process, how would you like that. (Now I wait James tocome up with some smarty-ass reply like he always does, dont even try it this time, I expect Simon to say: "Hahahahahahaha you suck, I dont give a s*%t, if you caught fireI would come around and pour kerosene on it to make it burn some more, etc, you are un - leet, blahdy blah etc etc etc) Whatever  Hmm, i see that Simon's trying to turn my signiture against me, enough of this nonsense. Simon sig is: Tribute to jamiesunl33tnessdoesntgetasmuchmoneyasconor, whichmeans that although me and Conor both work, Conor gets paid an extra 20p/hour more than I do. I believe than I actaully  earn  money. Tell me again, how much do you earn? Since Simon is more of the mathematical type, hers a little equation for you to work out the answer to the above question:  Y(0)U   x   34(r)\ +  f(_)((C))  -   41_1_   x   s(*0*)   -   $7f\_/!!   =   Simon is totally unl33t  lol :P, only j/king    Tribute tothy openmindedness    Jamie
