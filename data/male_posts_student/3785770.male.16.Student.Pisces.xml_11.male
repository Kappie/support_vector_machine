This has been going on for some time now – but I'd say within the last six months or so, the tools have evolved to the point that almost anyone can do it regardless of their tech skillz. So for all of you afraid of soldering or opening your Xbox, this may be the method for you. Choosing your path –   In modding the Xbox, there are two paths to choose from: EvolutionX and Xbox Linux. Each adds its own unique functionality to your Xbox, so read on and decide which is best for you. EvolutionX:  EvoX is an Xbox dashboard replacement. Meaning it replaces that green Xbox startup screen with EvoX startup screen and functionality. Without EvoX you wouldn't be able to launch any 3rd party applications or backed up games. Xbox Linux:  If you're looking for a cheap little file server, web server, or a cool way to surf the web from your TV – Xbox Linux is your answer. If you have no idea what Linux is, or what I’m talking about, stick with EvolutionX. Getting started:    -  urlLink MechAssault for N00bs  (EvoX)   -  urlLink Xbox Linux    Needed parts:   -  urlLink Mech Assault  (Non-Platinum Version)   -  urlLink Action Replay    -  urlLink USB Adapter    Resources:   -  urlLink Xbox Scene    -  urlLink EMule Plus      Depending on which route you choose (EvoX or Linux) the above tutorials will walk you through step-by-step.
