Even though I tried to learn how to do the "one two three" with Emily Brisbon. Then Kirsten told Jason Kohn how I had done everything a date is supposed to except dance with her, and he called me a slacker. That was the best part of the evening. I then later proved to be a hypocrite and danced my ass somewhat looser to the tune of "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" with Joanna. In retrospect, I could've danced a lot cooler. After Nancy's ball I got home around 12:30-1:00-ish (?) and decide to see if I could load Windows XP Professional on to my shit old laptop. I was half awake through the process, which ended around 3 due to incredibly slow load times, and my laptop's inability to restart without forceful intervention.   I woke up Saturday morning and realized how easy it is to ruin a laptop when you're half asleep and at the same time 'toe-up' on socializing. So I spent the morning deleting, reinstalling, registry editing, and eventually giving up. Maybe I'll check back later to see if this little black slab has healed itself, but more likely, I'll check back later and smash it to bits with my bloody torn-up fists. I then found there was nothing worth doing outside of my own room, and watched ancient movies on TCM for about 5 hours, until Stephen got back from grocery shopping, I then did the exact same thing for about 2 more hours, after consuming three or four cans of Coke. TCM is quickly becoming one of my favorites channels, next to TechTV, and right now, is one of the few channels I know the number for on our damned new satellite service. I swear, it is the least efficient form of service I've ever seen.  Today, I woke up around 11 and drank some more Coke, then started tweaking my desktop PC a bit more. Making this machine about as efficient and friendly as a really efficient subjective weapon can be. 6 hours and 2 more Cokes later  urlLink Guy  stopped by and we worked on the  urlLink new hartzmakee song  a bit, adding some guitar and a tweaked keyboard. If you listen real close at around the 48 second mark, you can hear my favorite part. The guitar and bass intersect so perfectly. Otherwise, it's really slow and nice and meditative. I'm going to try to re-do the guitar track to have much more intersections, and some hotter timing. By hotter I happen to mean accurate. Hopefully I can finish this up in mixing, because I'm loosing interest in writing material for it. Sometimes I feel as though I have no patience for the process of creating music, but more for the working of it, i.e. directing a movie rather than acting in it. Half-way through recording, I walked my dog and came up with some lines which I wrote down in my little marble ass-note-book.   "He finds it's hard to speak, in his own room for weeks, his bed's the eastern front, when fighting off disease. Sit straight up, don't stare."   I can only assume this is me thinking about being bed-ridden by a cold, and thinking about double-you double-you two after downloading  urlLink Red Orchestra . I also wrote "such great heights" followed by a doodle of a drumset. Now I understand the value of jotting down ideas; in return I get vague or indecipherable garbage! Score! Those lines are neat though. Maybe I'll use them for something.  Tomorrow starts another school week, the fourth to last of the school year. Hopefully I've done better this quarter, but It's really hard to say. I'm not feeling too optimistic though,  because I'm really good at sneaking in and sabotaging my own education. Good grades are reserved for smart and pretty girls.
