Maybe I'll make a trip down to Norwest today and pick up a comic or a magazine. I recently had a debate with Mel about the merits of the USA.  When it comes to the U.S I am a fanboy. Who wouldn't be? I mean it is the land of Cinnamon gum, Comic Books, Hollywood action movies and flavoured cola! Doesn't that justify the war on Iraq? Doesn't that just counter balance Bush's folly?   Indeed it does.   If you think about where we live now, in Australia, the U.S is much more appealing. Why does Australia suck?  1- No Cinnamon Gum, where you do get it, it is shit expensive. 2- Comic books, an issue of Amazing Spiderman takes 2 MONTHS to come out, when it is suposed to come out MONTHLY (and it is a back issue not taking into consideration the lag already). 3- CDs are shit expensive. 4- Our transport system sucks lukewarm ball sacks. Buses come once an hour and usually come 20 mins late. Buses in anywhere else, apart from Australia and Antarctica, come every ten minutes- no- SECONDS- and are prompt. 5- It's boring here, we have no night life. Too slow.  I know, there are much more worse off countries than Australia and that I am quite lucky and grateful to be an Australian citizen. But that doesn't justify the fact that I am a bored, materialistic teenager who wants more. I WANT MY GUM! OR A DECENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM! Australia has neither of these things.   Just give me some gum and I'll shut up.   Colin.
