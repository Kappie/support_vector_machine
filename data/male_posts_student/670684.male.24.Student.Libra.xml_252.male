This is my second round with the beast, the first coming in April 2001, after a great run as Bartley McCormick in Martin McDonaugh's  urlLink The Cripple of Inishmaan .  During a quick scene change, I would have to jump out of my costume and into another, and every night, my nuts would kill me after the change...like I had jarred them.  The pain got worse and worse, until the morning after the last show I could barely walk with the pain.  I went to Nurse Judy for a consultation, where Bob Calhoun was more than happy to share his opinion...Nurse Judy got me to a doctor, I had a through examination including prostate check, and was given antibiotics.  And I was told not to "use my organ" for a month.    Because Epididymitis is an STD.    But I'm not having sex these days.    And I wasn't the last time this happened.    The thought regarding Epididymitis is that it hurts, it sucks, and hopefully you've got a lot of stank on your hang-low to compensate for your troubles, because this isn't anything like Chlamydia.  Both times, I was in the middle of a dry spell.  Goes to show that I should never not be having sex.    The medicine runs $135 for 28 pills, 2 pills a day.  FUCK!  I was told by Daniel Young not to get the prescription, but just to "spray some Windex on those small boys."  So until my UT insurance kicks in, I'm dropping car insurance money on some Ciprofloxacin 500mg.    I asked the doctor if I should refrain from sexual activity during the term of the medicine.  His words:   Whatever you want.   Let's see how long I can be strong "for my own good" when the doctor is telling me to rub 'em out without delay.    Chris mentioned that I should mention breasts in the title of my first nonfiction anthology.  I've improved on his technique, coming up with the title   Boobs, Beers, and Balls.  And Shits.    That'd sell like rubbers!
