I've been able to build character out of it all. like ..... in the beginning or 8th grade.. ...how could i have known that anyone could make you look forward and anxious to go to school..... or anywhere for that matter. i couldnt know that i was a nice catch(and im quotin a few of my gurlfriends so dont think im conceited) hell i was an insecure lil bizzatch around that time. now its like ... well...... things have changed for the better. :).  something else i can say now thanks to this year. women are one trouble we cant get enough of. kinda like drugs:-p except it's a lot harder to quit this drug once you're hooked. well maybe i'm saying that prematurly. i still have a few years coming hopefully. lets see how ive progressed this time next year.   theres some people i  feel i should apologize to. bobby... im sorry life thrust me between you and ave.  you were pretty awesome as far as i got to know though i dont claim to know you. kaitlyn, im sorry we cant be friends ...... im sorry you cant chill out and relax so we can be friends. im sorry for anyone i forgot to include. as soon as i remember you ill be sure to give you your due.   ive discovered the magic of thought and self discovery. i hope you all remember my 12-1 post..... you know...... the 7pg write up that led to my short lived go-go blog. well that did it. gotta thank aaron now for sparkin that. ever since i wrote that ive had a none stop thought fest. it sparked my critical thinking which is still going on right now. or am i jus forcing myself subconcsiously to do it for the sake of keeping it up......... see what i mean?   way too many people to thank. however i have a few that stand out and deserve special recognition. ave, thank you for sparking the 1st few paragraphs of this post. Wuv ya!   ive come to learn that anger is a wasted emotion. it leads nowhere. give me peace happyness and love any time:-D \m/   i have one more person to apologize to...... ave ...... im sorry we cant ring in the new year together...... i miss you and im sorry that its so damn hard to get over you. but thanks to you i realise that ..... emo comes in all varieties..... you helped and are still helpin me feelin me the best one of em:)   damn i have AMAZING friends. nathen, roy, kelley, liz........ :) you you guys know what i mean :) im sorry i only just now told ya guys that.   you know what? im sick of lookin for things to be appreciative for. have an awesome new year everybody! and screw this "good luck in the new year"  shit. cus if you believe enough in yourself.... you wont need it :)
