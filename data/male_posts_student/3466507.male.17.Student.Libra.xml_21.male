She's grown quite a lot since then(4 years ago) and according to her, so have I. I couldn't recognise her, and vice versa. Luckily I recognised her mum. I had to travel quite a bit from Sunway to KLCC, but it was worth every single bit of the trouble, and even more. I had a headache the whole time I met her, but then I still felt quite happy. Some things about her haven't change, e.g. her voice, haha.... I keep in contact with her sometimes through the phone, so I hear her voice from time to time.  She's grown a lot, physically. Mentally, she still has some of her old ways of thinking, haha... luckily it is so, if not I would have been meeting a perfect sranger. We haven't been exchanging letters this year, but it'll start again this year, hopefully, after this meeting.
