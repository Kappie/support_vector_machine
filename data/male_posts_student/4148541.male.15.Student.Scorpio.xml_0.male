I am going to meet up toomorrow...(looks at clock) today....at 1:30 and we will hang for about an hour and a half.  Then I go to the riverdance and she goes shopping with her friends who are in town.  after the RD i meetup and go to dinner with her somewhere.  She seems very........permiscuous. Which is a plus.....the accent.....another plus.....likes me for my personality......another plus.........we will see what tomorrow brings.  I beat doom 3 on expert, wasnt hard. Now I am playing it on Nightmare, you lose your life points automatically.....this will be fun.....  Found my school finally Wesley College. Yes yes I know it's my name.  They want me to help manage and secure their wireless network. They have an OC line it seems so I will be able to abuse that quite nicely. I can open ports for common p2p networks and use it. just bring my Iriver to school.....leave my laptop online in a locker,  I get a good upload speed and thus a fast download speed since all the  networks I use dont allow leechers (which is a good thing). There is a downside, I have to have my computer fill up on filtering software. I will just install a keylogger whilst i do it and get the password for it.  Thats the easy way......I have others....but if I get caught I get holy hell...(religious school)  Sooooo I probably wont do it at all.....  Peace
