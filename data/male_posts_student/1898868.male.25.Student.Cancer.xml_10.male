Justin, I like your ideas so far.  Too build on a couple of them…   I would like to have characters that say “dude” a lot, but I think that might be a bit too much dude, where’s my car-ish… I do however think there's something in characters who say something annoying all the time that think it's cool.  I think thats the way the MTV type of person strikes the average person, and it'd be fun to exaggerate that for our purposes.    I think there’s an idea with the “can you watch this for me”… in fact, it could provide a good start for our movie.  How about an idea where there are 4 or 5 dudes are doing this show like Jackass or whatever, and then they choose this stunt you’re talking about to do… the only thing is, the guy who is doing the initial “will you watch this for me” knows that their show is going to be cancelled, and is setting up all the other guys to go to jail so he can have his own show… The other guys go and steal whatever the 3rd party is “watching” and then some overzealous cops bust in.  Meanwhile, the 3 or 4 who are really getting arrested think they’re on punk’d (or shall we call it “treated”?) and they keep yelling, “aww hell yeah, where’s ashton?  We got treat’d!”)  But then they go to jail, xtv won’t bail them out and tell the cops it was just a show, and they have to call their girlfriends, who dump them on the way home because their show got dropped, they’re out of the limelight, and their ex-friend gets the spotlight, all their girlfriends, and a bunch of cash.  They get off but have to spend lots of cash on lawyers maybe?  Then we could have a revenge plot, get back to being famous plot, and fuck these corporate dudes who only care about money plot.  We could also work the punk band aspect as well… It’d also be fun, because as an intro we could definitely write some good shit making fun of those jackass shows, but enough so that it was original and not just satire.    Justin, I don’t know if you saw, but I left a comment on your thing about the dude with the watch dressed up as a Monopoly guy playing board games at the bar.  That really reminded me of that show on Comedy Central, trigger Happy TV, where the people dressed up in dog suits get in fights in the bar… I love that shit, and I think it goes far.  We should definitely include a few things in that vein.  In fact, I think it would be funny if these guys were such extreme stunt dudes that they found that they became unable to relate to people in their everyday lives.  Like they had to do variations on stunts just in going to the grocery store… and they realize that they are probably making asses out of themselves, but they just laugh at each other and know there’s nothing they can do about it… or they’re oblivious to their annoying nature.    I also think it would be cool if one of their side-friends (not a main character) was this totally rational, level-headed guy (different from a straight-man character, who could be a main char.) who was always saying things like, “Oh my God, are you serious?  You could seriously injure your knee doing that and there would be no way to repair it, I’ve seen it 100 times in physical therapy.”    Random idea I don’t want to forget (Characters represented as A, B, C, etc…): “A” climbs out of ridiculously tall SUV with the license plate “xtreme” and the letters “UHEV” visible next to his beer belly. A: It’s a new Ultra High Emissions Vehicle.  I also think we should write character bio’s per that book… I might try my hand at one over the next few days… make sure to buy it.    Jack, where are you!?  Get the fuck on here!
