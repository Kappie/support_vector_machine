Total: 8+3+2+8+2+1=24 hours.... where got time to rest our mind. Plus, 8 hours sleep realy not enough for me. I need at least 10 hours sleep to really make my mind clear or else i'll be a sleepy head and moody for the whole day. God should give us 30 hours oer day. GREEDY actually is just the human nature.  By the way, i am always plan to have a pet, maybe a hamster or something. *think* Maybe should opt for a dog. At least it wont die so easily...*laugh* Dog is the only animal i  think is loyal in this world... Don't mention their cuteness, they can really make upa very good companion to us...
