It's in German , 10 years ago, and it's about a guy who has a mom and she has a stroke and gets in coma, when the berlin's wall falls apart she still is in coma and 8 months later she wakes up, and the doctor says she can't have strong emotions, so the son can't tell her about the unification of German and he creates a big law, it's nice, emotive and good.   Up town girls is funny, it's about a woman who leanrs many things with a little girl and the woman ( molly) becomes a grown up which she wasn't! Very good and hearttoucing!   I started watching Dogville but i didn't like it. So i had to go to the Videostore and i had to take another one "Maid in Manhatan" it seem to be good. I'll watch it tomorrow.
