I had my 360 song CD in my CD player and was looking at my CD's auto ranking and it showed me this: 1."I Love You" Faith Evans 2."Stupid Girl (Techno Remix)" Garbage 3."Bills, Bills, Bills" Destiny's Child 4."Breath" Finkl 5."You know" ???: It's the song that Overnight Celebrity stole the beats from 6."Can You Keep A Secret?" Utada Hikaru 7."Everytime I Look" Blink 182 :I'm not sure on the title but it's the song in American Pie 8."Bomb" Kim Hung Yung 9."Queer" Garbage 10."Excuse Me Mr." No Doubt  Anyway after we left chukie cheese and thought man it's hot lets go to the pool. It's been raining all week and the sight of the sun was a beautiful thing. So we went home, changed and went to the pool. Bad luck strikes revenge! The pool had a dead rat in it. The pool staff took it out and threw it away. There was nobody there since most people come only on weekends. We still got in. (Yes in the rat pool.) but let me tell you that it was really cold! But after you wither in it you get use to it.   Bad Lucks not done.  After about an hour and a half it starts to cloud up but good thing we were on the way out. We went home and my cousins friend/neighbor came over. Her names Karina. I think my cousin is really mean to her but I try to tell her not to be so mean and i asked her why doesn't she like her she tells me "She's one year younger than me" I say "well my best friend is three years older than me." she looks away. Oh well i tried right? Then later they get bored so they want me to make a game. I make up a time challenge game with me as a dark voiced host. They had to find three items one was a cellphone, a baby doll, and a spongebob ball. They had 2 minutes to find them. I asked them if they want me to go easy or hard they said hard so that is what they got. Nikki found one item and ran out of time. karina found two items and ran out of time. Erik did the same as Nikki so i had to make a tie breaker. Erik won by finding one item in plain site in 27 seconds. Then I made them spot multiple items of certain colors in the basement and because nikki lost she had to up the stairs. (Not really I just said that with the dark voice) Karina won she had to find 8 Purple items, 12 black items, 6 blue items and 55 green,pink and gray items in 2:34:04 (minutes,seconds,milliseconds) minutes. They got bored again and decided to rent a game. They rented Lilo And Stich for PS and then went to dunking donuts. (really in NJ your always hungry  unlike in NY I was never hungry like this all I want is water in NY but in NJ it's food and juice...) I bought the new caramel swirl latte with two French crullers and said latte like ladday. The caramel latte was fine maybe it's because I'm not hooked on Coffee...   I like it here in NJ (and not just the fact of DSL internet) I feel more cofmtable than the city. It's surburban and calm but you need a car to go any where. I like just being in a house, but don't get me wrong I don't want to move here or anything but it was nice just being somewhere different for a while. Oh yeah   my mom passed the drivers test!!!!!!!!    finally she gets a car and I can drive it yeah hurray. O.k enough excitement.  I got the picture with me and terrah. It's a nice picture except that i got headphones around my neck...(I forgot...) man I was really happy in that picture. Terrah why do you live in Canada?
