Here's the link:   urlLink  http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/05/kerry.911/     So the basic premise is that Kerry attacked Bush's response on 9/11 saying that he should have left as soon as his aide gave him news, rather than waiting a whole 5 - 7 minutes. Kerry was quoted as saying "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to -- and I would have attended to it." Ok Mr. Kerry let's get some things straight pal. First off, the top aide did  not  say that America was under attack. Bush was told that airplanes had flown into the World Trade Centers and at that point it was considered a horrible accident not a terrorist attack. Now let's give Kerry the benefit of the doubt and say that his top aide did whisper " America is under attack." Now it would have been bad for the President not to leave immeadieatly, but honestly would five minutes make a large difference against a well orchestrated band of terrorists who had been planning this attack for years? Now let's not even get into the fact that this attack would never had happened had Clinton taken Osama out when given the chance, no he was too busy with Monica to care about such trivial things.  Enough of my ranting for tonight (or I guess this morning now) So I'm off to bed.  Todd
