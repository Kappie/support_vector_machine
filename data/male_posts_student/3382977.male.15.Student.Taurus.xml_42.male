After getting home at 10:30 after our intensive rehearsal i found out that i have 27 tickets sold total up till now...and they are due tomorrow at 10:30 when the pre concert rehearsal starts so i have a good bunch on my purple paper to hand in. very pleased with my success , didnt think i would get so many.
 
anyway... we are gonna celebrate my dads birthday tomorrow so i get to go to Outback Steakhouse (one of my favorite resturaunts) and make a cheesecake for fathers day which is coming up fast...until then, theres gonna be rehearsing from 10:30 to 12, then a lunch break, and then the concerts at 2 and it is supposed to be pretty long since we are also playing some encores at the end (which makes one full concerto, a full symphony, and a couple short pieces, and then two encores...its gonna be long).
