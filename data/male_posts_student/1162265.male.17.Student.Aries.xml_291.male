I can pretend to think of all the coolness in Poua, Liquid Gold, and Duji, but it's all a lie.  I can say that maybe some pharmaceutical drugs that are purely chemical, and not physically addictive aka Liquid Gold (Poppers), aren't as bad, but still they are horrible.  They ruin people, and the people they don't ruin end up usually ruining someone else.  Let's start with an example.  Heroin dealers are the scum of the earth.  Any human being that would willingly sell heroin to someone else, deserves to be murdered in the most painful way possible.  Then you have crack dealers, for those who don't know crack is like a bit of Coke mixed with a base... I'm assuming Baking Soda.  Crack is cheaper then ciggarettes in some respects, but VERY addictive.  It's common among urban poor black people, although when it first appeared in the mid to late 80's it was the biggest thing ever.  Quite a few rappers got their start in Crack, and it was basically cool to sell it, but not to use it. As I said, crack dealers are almost on par with heroin dealers.  Then we have the less bad people.  People who sell weed.  Americans who sell weed from a really far off source are usually just in it for money.  But Weed is terrible to grow, second only to growing Coke.  Weed makes farmers in South America, grow it rather then food because of it's huge demand world wide.  It kills soil, and since the people rarely rotate crops huge tracts are rainforest are torn down.  Weed trade in the United States might be light, but too the people South of us who are involved with it's direct production... It's not a game.  I don't know why I just typed all of this.  It's impossible to change any pot heads mind, and since their are so many of them, who I see every day, and act like are so normal, I guess I'm being a hypocrite.  Oh well.
