I wish I had a boyfriend, I have never had one before. I’ve only had girlfriends and that’s to keep my reputation. I had no feelings for the girl, which is pretty rude. I guess it would be called using them, but I have stopped going out with girls. Now that we are older all they want to do is kiss. Just the thought of kissing a girl makes me gag.  After marching band I had to go to a meeting for fall sports. I signed up for soccer for the second year. I played on JV last year and I will be doing the same this year. I guess its true what they say about soccer boys. hehe. My stupid step-mom was supposed to go, but she didn’t and I was forced to get a ride home from the coach.  Tomorrow is a very good day. I get to go to a concert. It’s the Southern Tier Swing Band, they are awesome. My band teacher plays bass in the band. I can’t wait, but it doesn’t start until 7:00pm. I can’t wait to hear the swinging trumpet players.  OMG, I am drinking tea, I hate tea. I only like it when there is no sugar, and I still don't really like it. Maybe I will get my hair cut tomorrow, whatever happens, happens. Well thats all for now. TTYL
