I've recently discovered that I love taking photographs and since then I carry my digital camera practically everywhere I go. As I was taking shots of the views, I noticed a man perched on a rock formation, reading his Bible in solitude. I couldn't help but think that he had chosen just the perfect spot to be alone with his God, his thoughts and nature.  It seems that life rushes by at break-neck speed. A moment of solitude, or at least the mere thought of it, seems like pure luxury. I have to slow down to remember to take more minutes alone to regroup and to appreciate the gift of silence.  I'm currently working on a 26 Things Photography Project. I'll post the link when its completed so you can see samples of my attempts at creative effort. In the meantime, enjoy some quiet time!
