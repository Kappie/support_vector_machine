It has failed misrably to a good online music services that have a wide range of songs and does not become useless after you decide not to pay the monthly fee. (note: the apple istore is not included.)    The prices for cd's are outrages. ex. Beatles Abby Road costs more then it did then when it was first released    It has  urlLink made criminals of most of America     and finally it has taken advantage of so many artists in so many ways: As it is the recording company owns the copyright of w/e the artists does for 30 years. Now they are trying to slip "work for Hire" contracts which makes the company keeping the copyrights indefinitly. They get most of the money leaving the artist with a mediocre sum  urlLink this is not what I was looking for  but it will do the other article claims that the band members get about $14,000 each per album. They control what we hear on the radio through kickbacks and help prevent divirsity on the radio They have tried to put through legislation that could literally "bomb" your computer erasing your mp3s and possibly your entire drive Lastly they have been handing out lawsuits to users of p2p networks and handing out very heavy penalties that are almost absurd     ok done with my rant for the day good night!
