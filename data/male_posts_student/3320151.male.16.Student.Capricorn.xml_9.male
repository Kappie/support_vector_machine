I would say i had enjoyed myself alot.. but thats an understatement! this would be the second time i have gone with schoolmates overseas.. and the experience is always quite fun without parents to nag at u. no... teachers dont count.. cos they give u more freedom =) the only downside to the trip was the huge prick in my heart when i realised how much the stuff we were to buy would cost. holy Sh*t! i could buy 4 singapore mcdonalds meals for 1 in switzerland.. lol! ahh.. the chocolates were pure heaven.. discovered liquor chocs there.. omg they RAWK. i think ive become an alcoholic.. hahah! ahhh... the trip wasnt all that bad considering she didnt go.. and i actually did have fun even though i was actually kinda forced to go. well.. the competition was really an eye opener too.. we realised ac band is not all it is made out to be unless every single person decides that he or she is not *special*. we also needed to learn coordination and all that stuff.. man i feel tired just talking about that lol. suffice to say the parts playing instruments were not as fun as sightseeing at leat a hundred mountains a day.. yes it DOES become quite monotonous after a while looking at peak after peak of perfection.. =P.  the highest points in the trips would have to be the food i guess.. haha i sound like such a glutton.. eating cheese fondue.. pizzas.. and *gasp!* rabbit meat! i have the picture of the rabbit we saw at the top of the stairway at rhinefalls etched in my mind forever.. with the second picture of rabbit meat cubes fried to solid imperfection doused with unhealthy sauce. yyuuuucksss. lol. ahhh i have alot to b*tch about on the tour but maybe i should just end soon. the people there are really laid back and open minded.. just like the restaurant waiters at a certain Bebbie's. boy oh boy they do really enjoy ripping us off and making us even dance sing and scream just for free... coke. ahahha i realised alot of crappy lame stuff happened there.. like seeing a guy jack off in the middle of our group.. that dirty old man.. and seeing circular rainbows. well the people i spent the most time with as a group would be ian yong kiat samuel and james.. they made the trip a very fun experience.. although i was not as close to them as those on the other bus. =/. well maybe there shall be a part 2 to this blog but until then all i have to say is i love the people on my bus to bits because they helped make the experience to switzerland more fun and exciting.. namely jovan the donkey and ian the llama. =) haha ''ill be back''.
