I went up there thinking that it would be really stupid. I got there and it was pretty neat. It wasn't as good as the  urlLink  Medieval Times   in New York City. I went there on a school music trip. But this fest was still pretty neat. It was over a 22 acre area and they had different stages where they had different plays of sorts. I liked the Puke  Snot comedy act! It was so funny. You had to be on your toes in order to understand them. They had some jousting, and some cool stands there where I bought some stuff. They had some people dressed up as hobos on the street and they would make fun of people. I would reccommend you going yourself.  Okay...onto shoe shopping. This didn't go quite as well as I had hoped it would. We are at the Nike Outlet in Minnesota. I was looking for shoes...and about 2 minutes after I get in there I say, "These shoes are cool!" And of course my mom says, "No those are UGLY!" Anyways...my sister looks at those same shoes about 20 minutes later and my mom is like, "Those are cool...do you want them???" I about crapped myself! But whatever...a few racist comments later by my dad and we are on the road again with everyone pissed off...end of story
