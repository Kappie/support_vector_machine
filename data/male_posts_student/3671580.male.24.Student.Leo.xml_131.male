After the game we drove to Dayton, and decided there to cancel the next day of the road trip for an off day.  Jeff bought a baseball glove at Meijer while I purchased Aloe Vera Gel for my sun burns.    When we got home, we watched Meatball and Milkshake, but Jeff was unimpressed.  This morning we played catch on the rolling green pastures of Terre Haute.  Tommorrow:  St. Louis!
