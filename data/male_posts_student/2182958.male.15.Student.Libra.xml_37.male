But otherwise, it was just like the first movie. This isn't the best sequal in the world, but if Spiderman 2 hadn't been released, i would say it was the best sequal this year, so don't let my stupid opinion stop you from seeing this movie because it was actually quite good.   urlLink       urlLink The Bourne Supremacy: The Chase   Watch this scene from the movie.
