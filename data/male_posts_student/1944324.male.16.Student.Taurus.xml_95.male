Anyway, my titles are going to be totally rad band names...if they existed.  Haha.  Anyways, I'm Marten and Nathan's friend...their super-hot, way-cool friend who just happens to be a girl.  Ha.  I win.  You lose.  Go home and send Marten peanuts.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
