Currently the job market seems to be doing good and most of my frnz who have gotten jobs in the past few months have done so in application development. I'am into graphics and modeling and since I haven't started my job search business seriously this kinda discussion petrifies me, it makes me think about the uncertain days ahead, the skills that I need to pick up to reinforce my repertoire, and how to squeeze time to learn new stuff when I will be busy with my thesis in the coming days.    Next few months could turn about to be the most signifcant time, it appears that the going will be tough but who will not want to go thru the grind if at the end of it u can end up with a job which u desire. I'am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best lets c how it turns out.    Murali.
