You see, Holland and Germany were enemies in the war which could result in the reason why there were so many fouls throughout the match, playing dangerously like this meant the referee Anders Frisk had to hand out a few yellow cards. I think this start was both good and bad as  they drew 1 - 1  but bad because a few Dutch got entered into the ref's notebook.  The players which got booked were Cocu, Heitinga, Seedorf  Stam Goals by  30' Frings   81' Van Nistelrooij
