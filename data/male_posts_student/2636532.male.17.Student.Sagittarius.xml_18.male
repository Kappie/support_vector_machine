As I was going through some old papers the other day, because it was raining out so I decided to clean them up, I stumbled across a speech I had written a few months ago.  I'm hoping that most of you aren't religiously inclined and if you are I in no way mean to offend with this speech, but whatever I’ll get chewed out about it by people later.  	God.  A simple 3 letter word that has rocked our world. But it’s not just “God”, it’s all of them, I’m talking about Jehovah, Buddha, Zeus, every single one of them. They al force people to do things that if using their own personal judgement they wouldn’t normally do.  Religion has and still does cause the most horrible atrocities known throughout history and present day. I’m betting that if you’re a religiously inclined person you’re probably thinking that I’m both possessed by santa and trying to corrupt my fellow man.  Or that I’m a “lost soul” who hasn’t yet seen the “light”, or maybe it’s that I’m the deer on the side of the road that sees that the light belongs to a semi racing for you.  Either way I wish to point out just how corrupt and horrible all religion truly is, and also the sheer ignorance and conformist ways of people who are supposedly guided by Dog.   	One example happened awhile ago, on TV I saw a program that was really just a televised mass but the priest said that all of the sexual harassment and pedophiles could be gotten rid of if everyone just turned to Dog.  But the funny but disturbing thing is that there are many accounts of sexual harassment towards children in orphanages from priests other supposed men of Dog and to top it all off, the church is protecting these so called “holy men”.  Can you taste just a bit of irony??  	But this corruption of the church hasn’t just started in recent years, it’s been going on for centuries.  Take for example the crusades, an entire war fought over the “holy” city of Jerusalem.  And what was accomplished?  Thousands of innocent people died for a cause in the name of some non-existent being.  In the first crusade alone many innocent pilgrims died when they were sent against the enemy, many of those pilgrims were unarmed.  The war would go on for over 300 years, when crusade after crusade would go and fight for Jerusalem.  But it was a war! What happened to the so-called peaceful and loving way of god?  	Another thing is during the Middle Ages, religion was used as a form of suppression by using fear, if you did anything wrong, absolutely anything, like missing church you would go to hell.  Religion was also used to explain the unexplainable, like if there was a leaky roof or if an animal got sick it would be blamed on a witch and then there’d be all sorts of wild accusations about who the witch was.  Pure hatred would make people accuse their neighbors, and once accused there was no escape, you died one way or another.  Either by being burned at the stake or through the tests in which case you would die a Christian death.  	Yet another example is the Spanish inquisition, during this time the Spanish royalty and clergy believed that there should be religious uniformity in Spain and they didn’t believe that people had the right to believe what they wanted.  And just like in the witch trials, there’d be wild accusations thrown about and anyone accused of being a heretic would be punished whether they did anything or not.  Anybody accused of being a heretic would be guilty until proven innocent.  People of all other religions were persecuted, such as Jews, Moors, and Muslims, they were all discriminated against.  	Speaking of discrimination, religion has caused the horrible forms of discrimination and bigotry ever, like the oppression of gays.  Religious people believe that other people have no right to choose, they believe that there is only one way to live and one way to believe.  They also don’t believe in a woman’s right to choose whether or not she has an abortion and they think it’s wrong in the extreme.  They say that taking a life is wrong, but they seem to have no problems with murdering the doctors for women’s clinics in the name of God.   	I don’t expect any of you to you to agree with my opinions I just hope that maybe you’ll think twice about anything that seems so good.  Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely; God is all-powerful Draw your own conclusions -Matt
