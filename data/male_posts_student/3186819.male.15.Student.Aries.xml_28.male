And I even have names! If it's male, then it's name will be Cheridan Charles Genung (Cher Chuckie for short). If it's female, Cherilyn Sarkasian LaPier Genung (hey! thats Cher's real name minus the Genung part). Thats right. My computerized child will be named after Cher! And other than that, they have another thing in common other than the name. THEY ARE BOTH MOSTLY MADE OF PLASTIC. Sorry Cher, I poke fun out of love :). Well, if only its crying was "This is a song for the ..." (hungry, lonely, dirty, etc.). Unfortunately, babies can't sing Cher. Oh well, c'est la vie!  By the way, I get to wear an empathy belly.....  By the way, the song on my site has changed. Guess to what! CHER!!!!
