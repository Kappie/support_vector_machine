I need to practice and hopefully I'll get better. Once I am an expert at kickflips, I'm moving on to backside flips (which I can rarely do, but fakie, which is easier). Damn skating is hard work.  I just got done playing Counter-Strike. I pwned so many noobs on it (go to  urlLink Pwned.nl  if you think I'm a retard)! Actually, I'm the one that got killed the mostâ€”95% of the people that play have no life outside of CS, so they are  experts . It pisses me off. Even when I join a "newbie" server, I get tons of pros waiting to shoot me in the head once I turn a corner. Oh well, I quit.
