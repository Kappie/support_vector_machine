Well, as we were walking up to the track, about read yo to do our punishment laps, we beheld a beautiful, yet strange sight: Mr. Chamberlain.  Bwhahahaha, Alex and I were so relieved coach Olsen wasn't there.  I did my kung fu speech, and it went well (I hope).  I normally don't get nervous when I speak to people, but my hand got a really bad nervous twitch.  Yikes.  Hansen was still gone.  Garrett and I got owned in Biology.  Today was mellow.  I wore my newer Megadeth shirt, and sure enough, a diehard Metalhead walked up to me and asked me where I got it.  I said I made it and how.    Then we shot the shit and talked about Metallica and Megadeth.  It was pretty cool.  I prolly need to do more research cards tonight.  Damn.
