First of all school is almost over and then there are just other reasons... Tennis has been getting longer and longer though, and playing with Conrad is the worst. At least I don't have to go to tennis tomorrow because I have to study for my AP Gov't test on Wednesday... Amen to that... I recently saw the movie The Last Samurai... Overall, it was a good movie but a little unrealistic as many movies are. The whole concept of Tom Cruise becoming a Samurai after spending only a few months among them is a little absurd.
