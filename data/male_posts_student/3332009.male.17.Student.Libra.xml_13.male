Rooney is really superb. He is only 18 and terrorising defence like nobody business. I am really happy that Thierry Henry finally scored. Euro 2004 is getting more and more exciting.  Away from soccer, I woke up at 12 noon  today, took a bath , ate my lunch and went to my room. I decided to clear my stuffs and my mind. I was shocked to find out that I have alot of shirts and pants that I have hardly wore before. I decided to give some of my small shirts away to the salvation army. Then,I sat down on my bed and started to think about my life.  Do I really have a pathetic life or is my life just ordinary? I think there are alot of wrong things in the past that I have done in my life which could have been prevented. I kept on thinking about how to improve myself. I know nobody in this world is perfect. I also thought about Felicia. I really miss her. It sounds crazy rite even though she dont really know me but I still miss her. Hope she will become part of my life. I found the Anthem of Our Dying Day by Story of the Year very interesting. It is a nice song.  Adios
