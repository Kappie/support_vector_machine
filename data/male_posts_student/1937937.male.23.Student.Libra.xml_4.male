Show  h  is a bijection.   Let's prove that it's an injection first:   h (A) =  h (A'), then we know that { a 1  , a 2  ,..., a n  ,...} = { a' 1  , a' 2  ,..., a' n  ,...}.  However, if A is not equal to A', then  a i   must differ from  a' i   for some  i  in Z + .  Thus, this function is injective.  To prove it is surjective, we show that for every  a i   in  h (A), multiply  a i     i  and if the result is not zero, add it to the set A.  Thus, we can get our original set out of  h (A) for every A; therefore,  h (A) is surjective.  If  h  is both injective and surjective, then it is bijective.  It's interesting to note here that there is no bijection between Z +  and the power series of Z + ; thus, by composition, we can see that there is no bijection between Z +  and our infinite cartesian product.  This implies that an infinite cartesian product is not countable.     [10/10.2]    Let X = {0,1}  {0,1}  ....  Define  h  : X -> [0,1] by  h ( a 1  , a 2  ,..., a n  ,...) =  a 1   / 2 +  a 2   / 2 2  + ... +  a n   / 2 n  = the infinite summation of  a n   / 2 n  as n goes from 1 to infinity.   Let  r 1   be  h (X) for some X.  Let us examine the cases:  Case 1:  r 1   = 1  X = {1,1,...}  Case 2:  r 1   = 0  X = {0,0,...}  Case 3: 0  r 1     As  i  goes from 1 to infinity, if  r i   => 1 / 2 i  then  r i+1   =  r i   - 1 / 2 i  and  a i   = 1.  This will yield a unique X for any  h (X), thus  h  is surjective.
