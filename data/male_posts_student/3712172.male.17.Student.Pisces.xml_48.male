Here's a ramble of my anger at the world, enjoy :)   Respect lacks definition, Reward cries out for greed, This world is corrupted, Indirectly, we all bleed,  Deserving the misery, Withstanding the pain, What were we all thinking? What did we have to gain?  A life full of sin, A morbidly choice, As many as there are, We relied on only one voice,  To speak for oneself, Has been ruled out for good, Nobody gave it a chance, Especially when we could,  We are now doomed to live in this place, It serves us right I suppose, But why should we complain? This is the life we basically chose,  Requirements mean nothing, Thinking is a shame, The world is nothing but a mockery, And we treat it like a game,  To be yourself or not, Is a question in the same, Who can we pin the problem on? Noone; We are all to blame.  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk  I guess it's more simple minded than anything. I really don't care though. It was enough effort for it to come right out of the blue that I had to type it all out. I guess that about explains my mood at this point. Not so much, negative, but "morbidly ingenious". I feel like I am thinking in a positively bad way. In a way that doesn't effect my train of thought or sanity. I am in the mood to vent, so I think I should take advantage of it while I am comfortable and seemingly interested in it.  I just find it completely and utterly horrible that we live the way we do. Everything is so fucked up. I am not playing Mr. Perfect here either; everyone that is old enough to think for themselves in a "semi" mature way can blame nobody but themselves. We contribute to everything that goes on in this world, indirectly and directly. And whether or not it's good or bad, people just don't give a shit. Incredible, isn't it? Selfishness, greed, objectifications, cold hearted people. It is nothing but a fucking joke. I can honestly admit to myself that I don't enjoy these things, or get a rise out of the misery they cause. The world is too good for a kind like us. Humans have the ability to think; and even if it is used in the worst way, it doesn't mean we are stupid. We know too much. People toy with nature, they toy with life, they toy with humanity. Is it right?   Society is based on so much more than, "how we live". How we act, how we think, how we handle situations, are just practicallities. The basics of society are nothing but a mere infatuation. One of which I am into myself, but do I have a choice? I will admit, society has me, but I would still consider myself rebellious in most of its senses.   To think badly of your own society, is when the worrying should start. Us humans have no sense of decency, and in general we all deserve the consequences that lie after this life is over.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Sorry for that. I got all worked up and into this post. I don't usually get so carried away.  Goodnight.
