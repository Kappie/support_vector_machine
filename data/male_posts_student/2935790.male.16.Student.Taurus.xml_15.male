If you're going to be educating future workers of society, you have to do a damn good job. For any of you incredibly smart teachers designing the curriculum, I'll put it this way. Managing Time == Good Cramming Work != Good WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!? HOW DO I READ A BOOK WHILE PRACTICALLY WRITING ONE?! HOW DO I PRESENT THE DAY AFTER I'M ASSIGNED A PRESENTATION?! HOW DO I STUDY FOR 3 EXAMS, WITH 4 UNITS IN EACH?! HOW DO I DO ALL THAT WHILE MAKING AN ART PROJECT ON HOW WRONG EDUCATION IS HANDLED?! HUH!?! H U H!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I HATE YOU!!!!!!  Ahhh. All better. Teachers, get smart you fucking idiots, if you're going to teach us do it right. If anything, the last couple weeks of school should be EMPTY so we can just study in order to pass! YOU IDIOTS! YOU STUPID GODDAMN IDIOTS YOU ARE SO STUPID I WANT TO SHOVE SALAD IN YOUR EYES AND SHAVE YOUR HEADS. UGH! I want to do good, but I just can't decide what to do good on first! I'll put my 10 pieces of work due into a hat, and I'll draw maybe 4, and do those. Joking. I will get it done. You'll see. I'll do it for all the slackers out there.  Love, as you can clearly see, Sean
