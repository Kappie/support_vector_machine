My eyes were swollen and my face was weird when I shot out of bed at 7am with that "Oh SHIT! I'm late..." panic feeling. Actually, I happened to wake up at a perfect time. I totally missed the alarm at 6:10am and must have just hit the button, whatever. So after stumbling around all day, forgetting things left and right, I made it here, to my chair at my desk - the walking dead. I almost didn't realize I was at the book store, I worked and worked trying to get this shipment out on the shelves and time flew by. As soon as I have worn completly out, it was time to go. Now I am off to shower and then bed.   current mood: wiped out current music: #681 pedro the lion - of minor prophets and their prostitute wives
