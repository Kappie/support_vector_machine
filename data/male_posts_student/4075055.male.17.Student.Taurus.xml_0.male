I'm having a bbq tomorrow (WOOO!) they're one of my most favourite things to do, I dunno who's gonna come I think it's just gonna be a few people I except...Neal, Linny and myself I think, I wanna call for Bethan at some time but I'm too scared to at the moment cos I havent spoke to her too much and she's like one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen and I expect I'll just blush around her constantly but if I see her in town or something I'll ask her to hang out with us or something, I'll hint about it next time she comes on or something but I doubt she gives a shit...
