My neck turned into stone, my stomach blew up, and I got carsick. We got to see the mariposas tho, and that was pretty cool. We have this really cool picture of hundreds of butterflies flying in front of the moon. It was like a 2 km walk up the mountain, and then another 2 down. So my legs died too. They went into shock and quivered like jello. And a bunch of little kids attacked the car trying to bum a ride off of us. Then we went to a restaurant and I ate Martha´s strawberries. Yeah, Martha´s turn to type.   Martha:  hello, i havent used a spanish keyboard in a long time... this 1 is my dad´s comp... i think i should take JD to Veracruz or Chiapas were there are a lot of "witch doctors" bc he has been REALLY unlucky (ESL word)... today he seems happier than yesterday tho maybe he´ll tell u about it...   JD:  I woke up this morning at a very nice hotel (with large shaving cuts that I covered with pink stuff.... but that´s not the point). I took a really long shower. And then I drank the rest of my Pepsi. Then we went to this awesome cathedral and I was like "whooooaaaaa, I´ve never been in a church this big before." We stalked the tour guide but then found out that we had to pay.... so we ran away. There were lots of shiny things.... Then we went to Martha´s cousin´s house, and it was very nice.    Martha interrupting me:  its pink!!!   JD:  Yes yes... much like your sexy pajamas..... *cough* sorry got a little carried away there. I´m a helpless guy.   Martha interrupting again:  all guys r....   JD:  yes yes and I´m proud not to be an exception!    Martha:  my aunt liked JD´s eyes!!!   JD:  score. *martha sneezed* yeah so moving on. then we drove to Ocotlán. Marco and I played a lot of Mario Kart in the car, but I gave up after the computer mopped the floor with our dead and defeated bodies. Marco, however, persisted. He lost the 150cc cup at least 20 times. I told him he needed a Gameshark. He told me I needed some guts. I shriveled up in the corner and cried myself to sleep. Heh, not really. Then we got here. Martha´s turn.   Martha:  i gave him a tour of the house, and he got to see the "bomb shelter" and the empty part of the house... then we went 4 a walk around the neighborhood... then we came back and he found a scorpion on the stairs... finally he ate something he liked... hamburgers... after he ate his hamburger he went to my room to practice his trumpet... i think he liked my backstreet boys posters that i have in that room...   JD interrupting:  that´s so not true!!!!   Martha again:  ok, not the backstreet boys just nick... and kevin.... ill let him talk now...   JD back in power:  Yeah.... I admit it. So I practiced until my lips died. Martha drew a picture of a funky munkey with excess facial hair.   Martha interrupting:  a beard   JD:  yes, a beard. Then we talked for a long time about everything from All District Band to sex. *cue music*    Martha once again:  explain to them so they dont get the wrong idea...   JD:  It all started with the thing about how she was turning 18 in February and "it" would be illegal. We determined that as lucky as I may say I am on this blog, I´m never going to  get  lucky. What a shame. But at least Martha upholds her principles, so that´s a huge plus.   THE QUOTE OF THE YEAR:  Do you want some ice cream? That I can offer you...  lol   JD:  so i ate my ice cream (well half of it) and then I watched a movie about submarines from the future.   Martha:  we all live in the yellow submarine...   JD:  well at least you do. speaking of which eleanor rigby is playing on the stereo... It was all Martha´s master plan to distract me while she washed up. It worked.   Martha:  why did u choose that title?   JD:  heheh, that´s your fault. so the movie is about 20 minutes from over and she walks in...  "Hello again.... should I tell you?" "Eh? Yeah go ahead (not knowing what to expect)" *tosses me an uninflated blue balloon* "Sorry, it´s the closest thing I could find." *much sheepish grinning and blushing* "I thought you were a good girl!"   Martha:  well i did that bc of what we had been talking about... :-P   JD:  No complaints here. Well that´s about it for my fun-filled day. Say goodnight Martha!   Martha:  goodnight to all the helpless guys that will read this blog...   JD:  Te quiero.   Martha:  yo mas, bye.
