Right now its red, hard, and about the size of a  half dollar coin and growing. I dont want to go to the doctor just yet, because I want to have a chance to talk to Reegan, and we are going to be out later. I spent the day at Eliches, it was ok, exept for my leg kept hurting me. I think that the next time Reegan get online, if I havent called her by then, Im just going to throw pleasantries to the wind and try and arrage a meeting. I hope it works. Post later.
