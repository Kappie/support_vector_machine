We were so excited to attend game six, which would have been tomorrow.  So much for Norm's purple and gold face paint.  Perhaps next year...      Happy Happy Birthday Wishes to Judy!  You only turn 30 once.     We can't wait for you guys to visit.  We'll have fun celebrating your birthday...Norm has big plans.  Have a wonderful and relaxing day!  Burke Williams here we come.
