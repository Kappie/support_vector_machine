We played Fortune Faded perfectly. Some other songs. I think we're forming a band. Then later on, Heaton had to go out to dinner. Oh, I'm too tired to explain everything about Xbox controllers and the funnyness. Ok, I'll explain. We had to go get Heaton's xbox controllers at Dan's because he was crying for them so we got em. Then he left and forgot em but we forgot about em too. As Matt and I were eating pizza my mom just plopped the xbox controllers in front of our plates...we laughed. Funny. I'm so fucking tired. The computer gets me tired. Just strains your eyes and shit. Ok so later on Dan and Jimmy came over. And Paul and John and Pat came over out of no where. It was awesome. We played Guesstures. It's like Sharades only it comes in a board game box. It was fun in a barrel. Crap 3 minutes left. So we had fun. I couldn't go to Kate's. Girl's got mad at me. I'm now alone and everyone left. HEY GUYS YOU GOTTA GO. 2 minutes left so this is Johnny Gomez saying good fight, good night. BOOM. Lookin down the barrel of a loaded Thnikkaman.
