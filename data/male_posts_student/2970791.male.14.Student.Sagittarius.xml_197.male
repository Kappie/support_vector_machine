I was at the Blink 182/ No Doubt concert, which was seroiuly rockin' and they had this thingy, were they played like a slower song and they were like "before many of u were born, in the late 90's, during a slow song poeple held up lighters, but now it's the techonloy age and everything so in recongion of this ever hold up you're cell phones instead". Cool idea right, well its was awesome, one of the coolest thing's I've ever seen. Just had to share that moment, and i got a cool pic but it was too dark and didnt come out right.
