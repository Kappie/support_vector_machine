Around their friends and family things seem to be uneventful enough to not have much to worry about.  This is just a lead up to what I had to put up w/ last night, and early in the morning.  Breaking up fights here and there, and also almost getting in one.  One guy ( my cousin ) tried to swing @ me, but I shoved him and squared up just to find out he was going to start in on some young folks.  It's weird when adrenaline gets to pumping through you and your aggression levels suddenly skyrocket.  It's weird because, nothing starts to matter once someone does one wrong thing or even looks at you  'differently.'   I was ready to get into a fight w/ my own cousin in this state.  Well, we didn't, so I don't have anything to regret other than just shoving him.  Then, there were the other fights, and needless punches thrown randomly.  Younger bucks are trying to earn some stripes, but instead of doing anything like going up against people who will give them a go, they start in on each other?  Then, some folks just get wild.  I actually had to get someone off of another because of  a serious choke hold .  The guy's face was  purple  who was getting choked.  Someone came in and got his kick in, so I step up to him and he just says,  'that's my brother!'   It was his brother getting choked.  Before that this gul tried breaking things up and getting loud, so she was by the wrong person @ the wrong time and got punched out after a punch was thrown @ that guy but got her.  All this stuff going on, and I'm trying to get folks off of each other, keep some folks from trying to jump in and probably get jumped themselves afterwords.  So, after some serious violence and then a bunch of yelling around, I get to heading out.  I didn't take part in much of the violence, or even any yelling around other than just, " get off of him ," or " it's over !"  Well, that and " let's go, the cops are coming !"  So I get gone, and am knowing if the cops actually showed up, but they did in fact pass by speeding.  Probably to go to another incident elsewhere, but before they find out about the spot I was @, I was ghost.
