Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunlight that lights my heart within I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise Come take my hand and together we will rise On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Flying high upon the wings of love You look at me and I begin to melt Just like the snow when the ray of sun is felt I'm crazy bout ya baby can't you see I'd be so delighted if you could come with me On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Flying high up on the wings of love Yes you belong to me I'm yours exclusively Right now we live and breathe  Each other indispensable it seems, We're flowing like a stream Running free flowing on the wings of love On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love only the two of us Together flying high Together flying high  On the wings of love up and above the clouds The only way to fly is on the wings of love On the wings of love  Only the two of us together flying high Together flying high Upon the wings of love
