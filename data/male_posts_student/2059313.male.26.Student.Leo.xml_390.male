I don't think the government should have ANY control over business owners.  They shouldn't have to worry about making a building safe for people to enter the premises.  After all, it's their choice if they want to step inside a condemned building.  I definitely think that health inspectors should stay OUT of kitchens in restaurants.  Who cares if there are a couple of rats running around the kitchen... it doesn't bother me if an employee doesn't wash his/her hands after using the bathroom and then handling my food.  What's a couple of hairs in food between total strangers, right?  The government regulates all kinds of things, things that we take for granted every day, things that we wouldn't think of changing... all for public health and safety.  If you're a smoker.  That's fine, I'm not telling you not to smoke, just don't smoke around me.  An hour in a restaurant WON'T kill you to be without a cigarette.   Second-to-Last thought:  I think an exception to the ban should have been made in the fact that if someone wanted to open an establishment especially for smokers (aka - a smoking bar or a cigar bar) that should be allowed.   Last thought:   Being a person who has been VERY affected by the horrors of cancer and other diseases due to smoking, I totally agree with the ban.  NOT going through with the ban is like sentencing everyone to a slow and ugly death.  If you disagree with me, feel free to take it up with my father - wait, you can't - he died from lung cancer caused by smoking almost 13 years ago.
