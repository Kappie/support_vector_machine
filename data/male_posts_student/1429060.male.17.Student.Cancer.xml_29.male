Sewanee is very lovely and bucolic and would allow great study but is rather restrictive in terms of a social life and solitary time. Vanderbilt is huge with many study possibilities and a rich social culture but it lacks the chance to really know the people on campus.  I have missed so very many of my companions of late. One young lady friend called me Tuesday before I left and wished to see me, but, alas, I was about to depart. Sadness. I hope to see her extremely soon. Possibly in school.  Which also sucks. School. It's about to begin in four damn days. Four damn days of working my butt off to finish the summer assignments I waited to begin because I am  Master Procrastinator . I shan't enjoy it.  A few days ago an asshole with a Ph.D. or an M.D. plowed my mother's car on the right side because he refused to obey the traffic rules. Fucking moron. Refused to stop at the dead light (review the Tennessee driver's handbook for dead lights) and plowed into the passenger side. With my brother in the passenger side. Luckily, it was a Volvo, and the steel beams prevented that door from entirely collapsing. Brother went to the hospital for minor facial injuries, but he's okay. The asshole is trying to say it was the light's fault, after changing his story from saying that he entirely stopped. (Bullshit-o-meter is rising).  Poetry while riding the road to Nashville. It was an attempt to mimic a fellow DOY member's style (Brandon; kudos to his poetry) with a mix of my own inspiration. So, it probably sucks. But I need opinions. Comment on it.   A rain haze hangs over the asphalt and i am forcibly reminded how death-like, how creepy horror-film scenario the road is looking, the sky is aglow in the west with a space-thrown candle light.  The horizon around the sun's eye is a deepening blue with a robe of strata cloud grimacing at the plants, and an intermittent rain begins to speckle the glass shield in tiny droplets of transparent quartz. Black tires are kicking water from the highway onto the car's rubber fingers.  Delta plain is fading into the rolling foothills that reach dry arms to drink from star light. I am noticing a pinkish glow to the starboard side of the music highway, flowing in gentle undulations.  Scores of notes rise in a passionate agony because a lovely lesbian can't take the fucking government that disintigrates economy like bleu cheese. I want to pull off the thoroughfare of living because I have a headache of sinus and anger and I want to think about it and take a still nature photograph.  Exxon spilled a few million gallons of oil on seabirds and fish and pretended that it never happened. The restroom is exactly what you expect at a gas station and smells of cancer stick fumes and stale urine, the woman who sells banana-flavoured Laffy Taffy at the glass counter fires back at the regular unshaven clients.  A piece of shattered glass is lodged in my left eye and another in my left aorta because little Bro and Mother were ploughed in the side by a Ph.D. bastard. She's been crying and Bro had on a neck brace, the Volvo is dying in a tow lot.  Piles of broken crystal fell onto them when beams of solid steel bent inward and the door of the glove compartment snapped.  The phone told me today that she had a dream where Apologetic Boy and a builder loved each other and twisted lips into sneers at Little Miss Rent and Detective Photographer tapped her shoulder and it's a prophecy I don't believe in because I'm washing away my palm's lifeline and I like Little Miss anyhow.   Okay, humans, I am off to eat rice. I hope to visit Java Cabana tonight for possibly the last open mic night before school, but if no one also drops by, I shan't.  Cheers, mortals.
