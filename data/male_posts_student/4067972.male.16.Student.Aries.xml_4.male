I'm lost. I've gone to look for myself, so if i get back before i return, please ask me to wait.  talk about being schitzo (or however you spell that 's' word i just wrote)   Anything in parenthesis can (not) be ignored.   this one drives me nuts, i keep reading it over and over again.  it's like one of those things to keep an idiot busy for 30 secs.      The latest survey shows that 3 out of 4 people make up 75% of the population.   well, there's some real insight.      If toast always lands jelly side down, and cats always land on their feet, what happens when you strap a piece of toast on a cat's back and drop it?   that seems like a waste of a perfectly good piece of toast. --that reminds me...where's my cat? i'm hungry.
