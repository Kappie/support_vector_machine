Stuffy nose, sinus infection, scratchy throat, and headaches is what I got.  Woohoo! Fun… >_  Haven’t blogged in awhile, cuz I just haven’t, so there.  Catch you up on some shit:  I went to Florida for the band trip.  That was really fun, but the rides were pretty lame.  However, everynight we saw some type of firework/laser show and those were spectacular.  How do they do that!? That must take a really long time to time everything perfectly, and none of the fireworks go off early by accident, it’s crazy.  It was nice to get somewheres warm.  Getting off the plane back in Michigan in shorts really stunk >_  Music outside of school has been really slow for me.  I haven’t touched my guitar in at least 2 weeks.  I think I might have mentioned doing something with Ben before, yea, that is still happening but it is going really slow.  We can’t fit eachother’s schedule’s so it is tough.  Kate n’ mine’s two month was yesterday.  Thought I would throw that out there.  She is at her friend’s house now, and we probably are gonna do something Sunday, but I guess you don’t really give two shits about that.  My academics are rising.  I raised my math grade to an 87  O_O  yea, ms. Teets is being a bitch and giving detentions out if homework is not finished.  Well, at least I am getting my homework done now.  Last time I checked I had a 97% in Biology, and I am proud of that.  The only grade I am really worried about is History, I am too scared to even check what it is.  I missed a lot of homework, plus the tests are hard as hell…  I might have mentioned this before, but the people that write the tests are college professors and they make it so that they try to trick you.  You know how in multiple choice there usually is one obviously wrong answer, two answers that are similar to the correct answer, and one correct answer?  Well for these tests they usually have one wrong answer, two answers that ARE correct, and one answer that is the MOST correct.  So you have 3 right answers of the 4, and you need to know which one is most correct.  So you can come out of the tests thinking you did great, and then realize you were right, but you actually were wrong…get it? No? Me either.  My mom is getting the vaporizer for me and cough medicine (yuk) for me.  Then I am gonna go to bed and get lots of rest and hopefully get better.  “You say goodbye, and I say hello…hello, hello! Don’t know why you say goodbye I say hello.”
