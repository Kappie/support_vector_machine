Not much went on today, I was sittin around doin what I always do, and was waitin on my Cuz to call so I could go there and hang out, but he didn't..so I'm just here bored and sh*t. I watched this movie "Back On The Bus" today, it was a GREAT movie! It was about these people on a bus on their way to the Million Man March, it was great, it had some real good lessons in it and it was funny and everything. If your sittin around with nothin to do you should watch that movie, its cool. I been thinkin on what I sould spend my money on right now, and I think I'm gonna pick up "99 Ways to Die" by Master P to add to my collection. Right now I have:  Ice Cream Man Only God Can Judge Me Ghetto Postage Game Face and 504 Boyz- Ballers  so I got a couple to go + his new one "Good Side, Bad Side" to complete my collection, but its cool. I cant find nothin to do, so I'm gonna go find somethin.  Later, -HAZE-
