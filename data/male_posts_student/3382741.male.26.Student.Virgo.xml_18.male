I find it strange how guys appear in my life in spurts ...  I may go 3 months not many anyone new of any intrest what-so-ever .. then alla sudden I meet 4 guys in one week.  I have been chatting with 4 new guys lately that seemed very interested in me.  The first was the guy who prompted my last post (you know the one where I proclaimed how much of an idiot I am .. maybe I should remove that one ... ::shrug:: .. ).  The second was the guy I was sposed to meet Sat night for a movie.  The third is a somewhat unusual guy who has taken me to be a therapist of some kind and continues to pour his mind out to me in email and seems to want to meet, but then also doesnt want to ... a little strange situation there.  The fourth is who I actually spent Saturday with and the only one of the lot that is really showing promise for a good long term friendship (and maybe more).  I did not stand up the guy I was sposed to go out with Sat to go out with someone else .. don't get me wrong.  I would not do that - it would be immature and petty and extremely rude.  However I did reschedule meeting him.  It turned out that it worked well for both of us.  I called him when I got off work Friday ... now keep in mind that I work MUCH close to where he lives than where I live.  So when we were talking I had the briliant thought that maybe we could hang out Friday instead of Sat (since I would not be in the area Sat and was hopeing to meet the other guy then anyway).  Now when I started this plan I had decided that if it went well and he wanted to still go to a movie Sat that it would be cool and we would ... however after getting to his house and talking with him I learned that he was actually relieved that we got together Friday instead becuase he didn't want to miss USC playing baseball Sat.  So problem solved.  He also seemed about as intelegent as a log ... not that I am trying to be mean here but that is how he came across.  So that is 2 of the 4 definately out of the pic ... and the other one so close to out that it's almost sad.  That leaves the newest guy ... David.  He really seems like a very nice guy.  But not perfect (like anyone ever is) ... first he is only 20 (which isnt a bad thing of itself but there is a level of immaturity that goes with that) ... second he seems to have some issues still plaugeing him with family.  Now as anyone who reads my blog should know I certainly understand about family issues ... but he is still in the middle of the mess.  He lives at home and doesnt feel he can do certain things becuase of family.  For example he had to get home before it was very late Sat (even tho he said he wanted to stay longer).  He also is talking about me having to pretend that I am a str8 friend to his parents ... and I don't really mind that - I can do it wihtout lying unless they ask me directly.  People always assume I am str8 and I usually just let them continue that assumtion.  So while I see some very good potential there I am leary of a couple of things.  He seems to be quite ennamered (sp?) with me tho.  He actually said "I feel like I have met the man of my dreams".  Does that scare me ... maybe a little  ... but only in that I am afriad he will get hurt if for whatever reason it doesnt work out.  I am at work today.  I am the only one here working today.  I am not supposed to be the only one working today.  I am not happy about it.  I am rather bored and alone.  Not to mention I have to do all the work myself and still being somewhat new around here still don't know the answers to a lot of the ?'s.  Oh well ... it does mean that I will be able to close the lab a little early tho.  Richard messaged me again last night at about 2:30am.  I was already asleep and didn't get the message till today.  He asked if I was going to atlanta today ... I did reply this afternoon and tell him no.  I don't really want to talk to him though until he apologizes for the way he treats me ... ignoring me most of the time then expecting me to answer when he messages me.  Whatever .. I think I am almost over him all the way.  So if any of you who are facinated by my blog (like anyone is [xcept maybe one person]) and have been just dying to know what ever became of linux ... lol yeah right.  Well I got it working to my satisfaction for almost everything I do with a computer.  I could not get open office to run (a program that is like MS Office), but I almost never use that.  I got both networking cards working (however I must enter the wireless key everything I reboot).  I actually quit usuing it all together tho and went back to windows since everything is so much easier there.  Today I am back on liux becuase it is the default boot OS and it started booting to it and i am too lazy to reboot to go back to windows, lol.  I really don't have any more playing to do with it right now tho.  Hmmm ... any other loose ends I left on here?  I can't think of any right now, but if there is anything that you, the readers, want to know please ask them in comments and I will try to get back to them as soon as possible.  laters
