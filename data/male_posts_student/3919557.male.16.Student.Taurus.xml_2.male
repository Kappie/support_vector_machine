Sarah didnt show up which was disappointing. After that I went home and got in a fight with my mom...yes I said it. It was bad too. Of course she said she was sorry, so its all good now. Then I went to the beach with my sister and Gage. That was fun, the water was awesome. It was a perfect day to go to the beach. My 8-year old cousin was there and I played with him in the water. He is a crazy kid. I have bible study tonight which is fun. It's always interesting. So I am hungry, suprise suprise. I don't think I can ever be full. I just eat and eat.  Wow, its amazing how much you can write about your day in these things. This is cool. I like the idea of them.  Well as fun as this is I am going to get going. I just spent like a 1/2 hour on the youth group forum which was intense. It was an awesome idea to start. But anyways yeah that was basically my day.
