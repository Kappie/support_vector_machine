Fahrenheit 9/11 4. Anchorman 5. the villiage  haha that was fun.   bad santa is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen period. its good enough to buy. which is pretty serious with me these days. secret window was a huge disspointment, johnny depp rocked in it, but that goes without saying, the ending was terrible and it runied the entire movie, horrible film, with a horrible horrible ending. john turturro was awesome as well, but again that goes without saying.    continued....   top 5 albums of all time:  1. bright eyes- lifted or the story is in the soil keep your ear to the ground 2. Nirvana-nevermind 3. pavement-slanted and enchanted 4. fugazi-13 songs 5. brand new-deja entendu   i really dont think that would be the same tommorow. but im confident that lifted... is the best album ever recorded.    well im done for now. be cool stay in school.
