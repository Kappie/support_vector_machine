She said I should continue doing this. HaHa. So pleased with myself.  The conversation part was easy. I have a lot of interesting ideas. I even made her laugh. I felt so relaxed! Meow meow!  Neopets revamped the Cybunny. It looked horrendous! It looks like some badly drawn cartoon. In fact, is is hideously resemble those cartoon rabbits I used to watch....produced by some producers (Acme?). I bet those Cybunnies will be abandoned into the pound once the make-over takes place. I pity their innocent souls.   LOL! Wendy suddenly thought of my meowing skills being influential. She thought that when I become famous and get interviewed, I would pass my meowing skills to the world, and I would be the first meowing person! LOL! Such a great imagination, Wendy! Love it! Meow Meow!   Oh well. That's all I think. Goodnight.
