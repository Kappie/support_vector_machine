And Leandra-that's the girl's name-says, "yes, Fufu, F-U-F-U."    Edit by Admin: Hehe we have been such a bad influence! anyway I'm to lazy to make a new post so I'll just stick it here. WE JUST GOT RATED A 2 OUT OF 10 ON THE GOOGLE TOOLBAR! MOST PERSONAL SITES AND BLOGS ARE 0'S 2/10 WERE GETTING SOMEWHERE!
