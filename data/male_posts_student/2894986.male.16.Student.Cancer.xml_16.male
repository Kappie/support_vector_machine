In the end, all I got was a bunch of thumbtacks and probably ecoli. Let me explain. As you know, searching for eggs is an easter tradition. We decided to continue this tradition, but with a new twist. We would eahc hide one egg for another person. In turn, the person you hide an egg for will hide one for you. But not just any egg. For some unknown reason, we decided to search for the smallest eggs we could find. Not a smart decision. After scoping out the best hiding spots for our eggs, we placed them and began our search. Remember that you are searching for a specific egg hidden for you only.   We all began our search in the backyard and Dad almost found his in the first couple minutes. But instead of opening the birdfeeder, he pulled it off of the stand. Then Dad came across another egg, the one I hid for Matt. Luckily I made sure my egg was securely in place becasue he shook the hell out of the swng canopy. Then a few minutes later Matt did the same thing. Not knowing at this moment, I had already been feet away form my egg a couple times. Twenty minutes had passed without a egg being found when we decided to narrow the search by telling in which yard we had hid our eggs. Five minutes later, Mom won the search by finding her egg hidden in the gas tank of the Tauras. Dad claimed second a few minutes later when he went back to the birdfeeder and successfully opened it this time. Matt and I were still struggling at this time. Just shows we hid our eggs better. At this time I seemed to begin wandering aimlessly which accomplished nothing. Then matt found his egg about 35 minutes in to the game. Before I continue the story I just want to state that Matt cheated. I had to search through a bucket full of bricks and ecoli infested water to find my egg. What the crap. I had searched through this same bucket dozens of times but always stopped because I thought Matt wouldn't put my egg floating on the water. You lousy bastard. All in all, it was a fun game that only our crazy family would think of doing. Wow we are wierd.  In our eggs, we were required to a prize for our enemy.  Prize recap: I won an egg full of thumbtacks. Thumbtacks that were in the buffet drawer. Thumbtacks I could have gotten in 5 seconds but instead searched 38 minutes for. Matt won a soccer ball eraser, rubberband, penny, Wint-O-Green Lifesaver and one of those things you put on the bottom of a chair so it doesn't scratch the floor. Mom won a qaurter. Dad won a penny, dead watch battery, and peppermint. Great prizes don't ya think?  This is what I have learened from this experience. Easter eggs are meant to have mulitple eggs for a reason. It's really hard to find really small eggs. Certain prizes are put in eggs for reasons, such as candy or money. My family is totally messed up in the head. Damn green box.   I had a good easter, hope your was just as good!  Jesus has risen, CLAP YOUR HANDS FOR HIM!
