Because of her calm attitude and generally undemanding ways, I cannot be angry at her. But my parents, my brother, even myself I loathe profusely! My mother recently went on a bloody rant about how our house is soooo messy and how Dad doesn't like coming home because it is messy. Firstly, who is Dad to hate coming home to a messy house he shared a part in making messy? Freekin' hypocrite!   And my mother! She nags and nags and nags about my hair, my room, and just about every part of my life she has a connection to. Maybe that's why I tried my damndest to keep her out of my life. Because I don't want to give her any more ammunition to nag with. So what if my room is messy? I like it that way! At least I don't mess up the rest of the house like she thinks apparently thinks I do.   And that little punk ass son of a biscuit-eater, my brother. He I dislike the second most! He is so damn self-centered, wouldn't give a rat's ass to save his Mom some work.   And me! Who am I to rant and rave about the stupid things of my family?! I'm just as much the dumbass! Perhaps I should listen more, or clean more, or something. But I don't. I'm just as lazy as my brother which adds hypocrite to the list of things I hate about myself.   *heavy panting* that felt good.
