No, they're not going to take the World Title off of JBL. WWE is going to be doing the unthinkable (At least to them)...  SPOILERS!!!111!!!111!!!!11117            Billy Kidman and Paul London are going to win the Tag Team titles from Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley. Is it possible that WWE is listening to the Smarks again? We can only hope.    Song of the Moment:   Green Day - Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)
