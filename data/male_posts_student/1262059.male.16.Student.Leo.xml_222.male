The weather in Toronto is such a fluxuating turmoil of mass air currents, almost as diverse as the people in the city.  It's sickening to have such cold weather develop into beautiful skies before returning to the deathly cold.  Although this is true, few things can down the spirits of students as the (skip?) off the school grounds to their long awaited homes, friends, and beds!   March Break.  Ahh...   As the author of this post seems to be quite random today, it's only fitting to end off with the Title.   #aar - Anime Academy Radio (irc channel)  Took me so long to join the irc server.  I guess it just wouldn't connect?  MSN doesn't seem to be working either...  The DJ on AAR (live feed, Anime and JPop music) was singing.  -_- I would comment on said singing, but said DJ is said irc channel's moderator.   That being said, some credit must be giving.  She wasn't always singing...   Half the time you could hear typing...  Once she had to get the phone...  This is  NOT  how you run a radio station people.   -_-   Oyoy the wooden toy.  I'd like to be a Radio DJ.   -ArV
