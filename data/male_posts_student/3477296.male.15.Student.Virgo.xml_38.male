I, Weller Zheng have joined this group blog, the poor buggers. They must really be the fools they are, for they have summoned their downfall as a respectable blog.  For you see, contarary to the disclaimer that this blog has, I probably do not have much of a life out side of blogging, whether it be for this blog or my own. However I am not yet a complete and downright loser as I do not have any associations to Star Trek conventions, math teachers and Stephen Hawking.  I will not post too much egregarios loads of bullshit on this site. Instead such material can be found at my own blog at "www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com". I warn those that go that is a damned effcient waste of time and about as coherent as eating a pair of boots when agitated.  That is all. Yours, Weller.
