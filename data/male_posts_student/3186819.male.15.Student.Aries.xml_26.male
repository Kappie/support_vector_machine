So I'll explain the last few days.  It all started Thursday night when I went to bed. Well, thats a lie. It started when I got woken up at 5AM Friday morning (I usually get up at 6:30/6:45/6:55) (excuse if the writing is bad, my dogs are really pissing me off). My mom woke me up to get her nebulizer (for those of you who are outside the asthma community, a nebulizer is liquid forms of puffers (i.e. Berotec (feneterol hydrobromide), Atrovent, Ventolin (salbutimol), etc) that is put into a kinda sealed cup with a nask attached. An air hose (if at home) or an oxygen tube (if in hospital or have a home oxygen tank). When the air reaches the liquid medication, it vapourizes and is breathed in through the mask). So yeah, she wakes me up to get her nebulizer, so I pour in the berotec nebule and the atrovent nebule and close the cup and start the machine. I go back to bed. I think it was just an asthma attack...  So I get home from school and cook supper. Mom phones and says she won't be home right away. When she does get home, she is barely breathing. Once again, Berotec nebulizer and puffer treatments (almost ODed). Nothing worked. So around 10:30PM Friday, Jeff (you know who he is) took her to the St. Joseph's Hospital Emergency Room. They rushed her to critical care. They wanted to intubate her (shove a tube down her throat and pump in air) but she refused. Oxygen and berotec was administered. They also ran solumedrol (a steroid used in asthma treatment, comnmonly known as Prednisone). So she was in ER until 8PM yesterday. Then they moved her to floor 7, room 7** (yeah, like I will tell you what room!!!).   So yeah, sounds good? Wrong. Dr.*some middle eastern name like cookamungeroanspikgnolasnghaodfh* and Dr. Nair both say that she will be there until at least Monday. Dr. Jesheck (sp? Its said Yesheck) said she looks horrible. So what does this remind me of???? When she was hospitalized in March on a Friday. They sound Monday.....Then it was Tuesday...When did she leave? SATURDAY! Bloody f***ing hell!   On top of this, they want to put her on "maintenance" steroids (so like life long almost). Corticosteroids they are called. They want her on Advair (shes already taking that along with Atrovent and Berotec). Advair contains a corticosteroid and a ventolin-like substance. In addition, they want her on Symbicort (another corticosteroid/ventolin-like thing, but different cortico/ventolin). Then Singulair (ANOTHER corticosteroid). And then they might have to continue with Solumedron (Prednisone)  So forgive me if I am distracted. Forgive me if I am negative. Forgive me if I break down in uncontrollable, insane tears. Sorry folks, but this person is too worried to care about anything else.  However I would like to add that EVERYONE has been so kind through all of this. The hospital staff, I love you all, you are doing a great job. And my uncle, aunt, other aunt, Grandad, Grandma, and even my mom's colleagues (shout out to Lynn) THANKS A BUNCH for your kindness. I Love you all and am glad to have you.
