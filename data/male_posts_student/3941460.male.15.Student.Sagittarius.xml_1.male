Work went by kinda fast, and I got to get soaked towards the end of the day...which was nice, because it was really hot. Yesterday my brother left. He came down for the weekend from Indiana, so that's always cool. He had some bad news though, becausehe and his girlfriend, of four and a half years, broke up on the way here, so that's no good. But we had fun; it was my niece's first birthday party on Saturday, and later that night we all went mini-putting at Volcano Falls.Sunday he left after playing golf with my parents and eating lunch with all of us. Then after that I went to get clothes for school...uniforms, but I also got a cool, new outfit for the weekends and the rest of the summer. Anyway, that's 'bout it for now...later.
