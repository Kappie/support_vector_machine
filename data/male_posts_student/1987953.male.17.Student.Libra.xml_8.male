We also had a new treat- sparkling apple cider. Now that's the stuff! (No, not Hostess!!!) Anyway, I have had trouble finding really good time to blog all the time. I am starting to budget my time a lot better and I should have the time.  Anyway, talk to you all soon! Blog ya later! Please comment!   In Christ, Mike
