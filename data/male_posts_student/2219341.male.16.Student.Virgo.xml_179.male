"I like to draw out the darker parts of people."  she said that.  Princess Diana said that.  its almost frightening...the similarities.  it is something that is fascinating...the darker, deeper parts of people.  the parts that no one will show  you.  the parts they dont want you to see.  the parts that define what you are.  if could have anything in the world...i would have the gift and curse of seeing those dark depths of people's souls.  and i wish i could show people me.  the real me.  underneath everything.  i think only one person still knows me.  and slowly...slowly she is losing her understanding.  its kinda sad knowing that it is dieing.  but everything must come to an end.  someday ill let someone else read me like an open book.  but for now ill just keep me tucked away.  dunno why.  no point in lettin it all hang out.  im not the kinda person who just lets everything out...i have to trust before i share.  well yeah.  i really miss talkin to someone i trust.  not that i dont trust anyone.  thats not true i do trust people.  but only in a certain way.  only to an extent.  my trust has been violated too many times to trust people completely.  show me your darkest part...then i will trust you.
