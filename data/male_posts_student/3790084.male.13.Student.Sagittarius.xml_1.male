Ok...many of my friends... sure will shot me back that I am already doing my Final year if I am asking this question... So, I've learnt to be wise... instead of them what am I on the right track, I will simply ask them, What they plan to do after graduate... and i will start telling them what I've in mind... For me, I want to do something really unrelated to IT after this. I am totally a slow learner and totally will got brain washed right after each semester's Final exam... I knew that, " somebody " might think that I am totally dummy on anything regarding to IT especially programming line... no offense... I am quite blurred sometimes where i actually need the person to keep on repeating the same question to me... I am really really sorry if i've been trouble u guys out there... :(  Well, today i actually ask this Q (What u plan to do after our graduation)... she told me she wans to do something related to IT course to brush up her programming skills or mayb some lecture stuff...  But for me... no IT anymore...  Mayb I'll plan to take up Accounting...  Then i started to share her my thoughts of being a  fashion design ,  PR ,  journalis t...etc..  But the problem is... i m not good at drawing (maybe even worse), PR?? not good at communication skills (don't know really how to express well). journalist??? not good at writing 'coz my grammar mistakes can actually make u go crazy... I am thinking on taking the Professional Japanese Language and really master at it... after that, mayb I can get a teaching job by then??  Ermm...what about own my own business??? too risky??? actually we are taking the risk on the things we are doing now... I m kinda worried too much... n forgot that we actually can troubleshoot if we made mistakes... But taking the wrong path, can i troubleshoot it???  For a fren out there... thanks for ur companion n ur advice... i will really plan my future by now... as u said i am not  17  anymore... time dont wait for us... i'll feedback u when i really got my mind set... n wat u found in me really flattered me...thanks again *huggies*
