This movie fed my attraction.  I look forward to seeing it again â€“ the sooner the better.  Here are some of my thoughts.   I'm not a naval historian, but thanks to some heads up from a few critics I was on the lookout for Mâ€™s details of seamanship--details that most modern movie makers neglect to include.  From removing the panels in the Captain's cabin to set up for battle to measuring speed in "knots," M offers multiple glimpses into the actual workings of early 19th-century naval warfare.  I saw some things that I knew of but had never seen reenacted, and several things that I didn't know about.  What a lesson.  And the story.  The M's lessons of friendship, leadership, and character were all told in a believable and attractive fashion.  Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast remain real and believableâ€”something that becomes more difficult the longer an actor like Crowe remains in the limelight.  The movie was also clean, which is always a plus for me.    I like what the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  said: â€œ"...probably the best movie of its kind ever made.â€? Good flick.  See it.
