We played football in Gregory Park, but John quit. I'm still pissed at him for ruining our precious football game.   Me and Chris drove around, found some place to park, and stopped. Then we rolled down all the windows and put our seats back and listened to Bob Marley. It was strangely fulfilling.  I take back everything I said about Ben Kweller. I tried to listen to it for a while and it just grated on me. Maybe I only liked it the first time because it was a Friday night CD. Anyway, that was my one-time fling with indie rock.  Me and the Oselands went down to the emo concert on Saturday night. We snuck in the side doors because it was like 5 bucks. This emo kid chewed us out because that 15 bucks would have helped to cover the costs of playing emo. It was the last concert of this band called Donkey's Jawbone. Anyway, while they were setting up the guitarist played the riff from the Bouncing Souls "Lamar Vannoy." We got excited, and thought that maybe we weren't in for a half hour of bad music. Then they started playing, and we hated it. It was just very unpleasant to listen to, and we left 2 minutes into their first song. Two good things did come out of it, though: One, I got to catch up with Shannon. I don't see her very often anymore. Two, Chris got to meet his hero again, Nate Lucas. Chris yelled, "Hey! Ferris!" down from the balcony and Nate replied with some sort of noise.   Overall, the weekend kinda sucked other than a few high points. It is pretty easy to deal with a crappy weekend though, because there is only three weeks of school left, and then [/i]every[i] day will be Saturday morning.   Lots of project work/Mother's day tomorrow.
