It's kind of sad really, is being gay a new fasion, and inorder to be gay you have to be stuck up? Weird. Well I took a walk tonight, listening to melo music, walking at a good decent pace, devouring the air. It was a nice walk. I think I might do this everynight. As I was walking, I was remembering how much before I wasnt a happy person, always bitter around the same people, a loser, a jerk, an asshole. And now, I think that with me kind of changing, I'm starting to be a nicer person, It's weird, cause like I never was this way, I used to be a very, very, very shy person, I still am, but not as much as before. You could ask anyone, I was shy, and kept things to myself, all the time. I still am like that, but not really . And If I do change, everything about me, I hope people will understand, cause this is how I am happy. I like going to shows and seeing all the "scene" kids, and then there is someone who usaually doesnt fit in. Thats me. I just hope that there are at least 5 people or even 4 people who will accept me, and want to hang around with me. Cause I know already that Junior year, will not be as good as I would expect it to be . Hey, but if all goes wrong, theres always that  other  alternative . Can you guess what that is ?
