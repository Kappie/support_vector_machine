I was still really tired b/c i always go to bed at like 1 or 2 on the weekends. So i got up ate some waffles and then ran out the door to go to Fremont. Then i stayed there for hours and hours getting ready for tomorrows performance at church. My arms got hecka tired from holding them up and also my fingers got tired from going up and down. After practice i sayed there for another hour and played Settlers of Catan or something like that.....ps thats a really fun game. Then i came home, watched the sharks win in OT 2-1.......ahhhhhh what a crazy game, played hocky, went on the computer to find NO ONE on to play Gunbound with, and then went out to eat with my bro b/c my parents were at a Valentines Adult Fellowship for my church. I came home, watched Out of Time, and now im sitting in front of the comp updating my blog. Tomorrow is the PIGS performance so please pray for our group that we spread the "good news" and glorify God in all that we do. ttfn
