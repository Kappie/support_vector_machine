I saw forest, streams, rivers and rednecks before making it to New Brunswick, NJ to meet up with John near Rutgers... very nice place. Then it was an awesome show in South Amboy.  The Bouncing Souls  and  One Man Army  really put on a good show. Then after the show... I briefly talked to One Man Army and then went to a bar back by Rutgers to rest up before my trip back. Caught a satanic metal band at the bar though, the singer broke a bottle and cut himself open with it, punched a hole in the ceiling and burned a bible. Then it was a 4 hr drive home through snow. I got home at 5 AM.  Saturday night I met up with friends at a bar and ended up talking to a crazy chick. That confirmed I'm a magnet for crazy girls. She was telling me about her psychiatrist. Nice huh?  Well a short week starts today... going to NYC Wednesday for Thanksgiving with relatives.   ****
