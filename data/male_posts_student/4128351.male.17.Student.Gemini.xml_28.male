Dad woke me up Thursday morning at 7 AM and told me I had to follow him to Gallipolis and bring him home.  So, I'm just cruising with the windows down, listening to my man Dave.  I even passed my lovely unsuspecting girlfriend on the way home.  We went through McDonald's and got food to go and went and ate breakfast in my marjar's office.  We had a typical intelligent conversation like always, with me coming out on top.  I'm so smart.      I went back to my second home, my Grandma's house, (my first home is Jami's) and talked to her while she sucked the smoke from a burning piece of paper.  She's been smoking since she was twenty and it scares me to death.  I fell asleep and woke up at 12:50.  I sped home, threw some clothes in the dryer to get the wrinkles out, took a shower, folded the clothes, and sped down the road.  I met Mom and Dad at the Mexican restaurant owned by my lovely girlfriend and they gave me some cash flow.  Don't worry, they'll get it all back on their prompt schedule, money is a big issue for them.  I hate money, by the way, I hate it to death.        Anyway, I went to Jamin's and we left for our big adventure.  I slept most of the way and then we arrived at Riverbend Music Center.  Ladies and gentlemen, here is where the fun begins.  I will probably use alot of profanity in this next part, forgive me ahead of time.        I fucking hate beer.  I hate yuppie girls, as Jamin calls them.  I hate posers, I hate wannabes.  I hate tall people with fat heads that stand in front of me when I want to see the stage.  I hate obese girls that wear skin tight clothes.  I hate preppie boys that listen to music because it's cool, not because they reflect with it and feel it in their soul.  And, I fucking hate alcohol.        I met Nathan at the concert, he was cool as hell.  I'm pretty sure the only thing we have in common is our love for music, but it's alright.  We're going to trade some CD's and all, he's a nice guy.  I also met two guys named Kevin and Chad, who actually liked listening to music as opposed to drinking beer.  People love their beer, especially the shitdick who spilled it all over my pants because he was too hammered to walk.  What a winner.        Anyway, I met Guster  again .  I talked to them for a second and got their autographs  again  and this time I got a pick from Ryan.  They thought it was cool I still had my ticket stub from the Athens show and liked my shirt that wasn't available anymore.  They're good guys, they have good music, too.       Dave's set was good.  It could have been better, spare the 11 PM noise ordinance Ohio has.  Stupid buckeyes cost me  Crush, #41,  and  Two Step.   Oh well, I'll see them again sometime.       We drove back to Jason's kickass apartment and hung out there til' the wee hours of the night.  Me and Jamin and Jason played guitar and Jamin told me stories and showed me pictures of the life he'd probably rather be living right now, a life in Norfolk.  Who can blame him though, this place is depressing.  I can't wait for me and my angel to bust free of it, as soon as possible.        We woke up at 12 and ate Buffalo Wild Wings and talked politics for a while.  Then, we drove home at 2 and arrived home at 5:30.  I had a really good time.       As  soon  as I got home, I was right back in the car headed to Parkersburg.  We went to Home Depot and Outback, and I'm really getting bored of telling myself about my life.  I hope someone other than me will read this sometime.  I know Jami will, maybe, I love her to death.  She's the greatest thing that has EVER happened to me.        As a matter of fact, I just got home from her house.  She was worn out from taking care of her dad and being stressed about Val.  I love her so much, I wish I would have been there for her that night, but I was gone.  I feel like I've let her down and it breaks my heart.  I'd do anything for her, anything.  I hope she knows that.        Well, my aficionados, I am going to go watch the movie  Signs  with Brice.        Today's Song to Illegally Steal off Kazaa is: "#41" by Dave Matthews Band, because  he  didn't play it in Cincinnati, but  we  did.        "Why won't you run in the rain and play?  Let the tears splash all over you."      Keep cool my babies.
