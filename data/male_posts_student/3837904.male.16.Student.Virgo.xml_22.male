But I guess I won't do it again cause I made Jas cry and I feel bad about it. Also I nearly got caught with my fags when my teacher told me to empty my bag. What luck? After school went smoking and ended up alone when Rach and Ernie had to go home and settle themselves their own things. Guess I'm just going to be alone another afternoon.
