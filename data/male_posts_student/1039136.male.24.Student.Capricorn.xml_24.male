I havent written in a long while, not because I was lazy, too busy, or uninspired, but more because I really havent had much of a chance to sit here and collect my thoughts well enough to put them into text.   Most people will sit and judge their weekends, holidays, or semesters as "good" or "bad' but i really don't believe in that for whatever reason(though i ask the same kinds of questions, ya know , like, how was youre break, how was class, etc).  Basically since i've last wrote, I can sum everything up in 2 words. I lived. I'm not so sure that life is about anything else but living. That is, experiencing, learning, hurting, laughing, loving, missing,... So yeah, I pretty much lived. I apologize for the vagueness here on this one but there are so many specifics, that it would take chapters to recap and honestly, i've probably forgotten most of the important details so my stories would be lacking.    So now a break from what you've all missed reading about, to shift focus  to the title of this post. I was raised by a pack of girls.  Where most boys spend much of their growing years hanging out with their dads and uncles, older brothers, and male cousins, I had very little male influence on my life.  My dad and i never really shared any common interests, my male cousin was younger than me, and I had no brothers. In esssence, most of my time was spent hanging out with my aunts and my grandmothers doing things like shopping or watching stupid crap on TV.  As a result, I have been dealing with the fact of being different than "typical guys" all my life. I just didnt have the right influence and did'nt really have any good friends in high school to change this either.  Basically sometimes i find myself almost battling the world because i think and feel differently than the rest.  I often find myself confused as to whether i should see the differences as a problem and work on changing or rather be happy that there are some unique things about me that set me apart from everyone else.  I find myself deeper than anyone expects me to be. Guys are just suppose to be dumb creatures who thrive from sex and nothing else..who fear attachment...use women like toys and all that...GOD forbid..a guy who thinks;) I dunno..thats enough therapy for now..i realize this is a journal and NOT a shrink session, but i had to get that out. I think that in a way it heals me or puts me at ease about some of the things about me when i write in this journal. I think maybe people reading this will make it easier for them to understand me and i'll feel less uneasy about who i am. Oops back to my life.  Lots of crazy things going on with the frat..without outright saying whats up..theres a big change coming for me for sure in that area.  Honestly i havent gotten what i expected out of the frat. Theres alot wrong with it and if anyone has any issue with me posting that in public, i have two words for you. FUCK OFF.  In a  few posts i'm going to vent wholeheartedly about what problems i have with things regarding the frat, Just not now.  I'm at a good place in my life right now where i'm just enjoying whatever comes. Thanks to mom's advice i'm learning to chill out and not worry about much anymore.  I'm still in the prelim phase of this though because i have to figure out exactly what i should worry about and what i should brush off.  Life is constant learning...learning breeds change, and if you avoid change youre avoiding living.  This is really painful sometimes to change..its not supposed to be easy now is it?  Its almost christmas time, which typically has been a "down" time for me. I'm not sure whether thats because of not having a full normal family anymore or what but this holiday i'm trying to be "up" for once.  It seems that in life if youre in a more positive mindset more good things happen, and when youre down..the world shits on you. I'm going to enjoy all this holiday stuff. I was actually thinking of going to NYC to see the city all lit up and stuff.   Today has been a pretty much chill day...woke up late..ate..opened my mail and got a good laugh...went to  eat and to the mall with joey and heather. I guess after long nights like last night, thats the kind of recovery needed. Crazy club night last night..gotta love Ev on thanksgiving.  Just a sorta side note..I think the reason i'm so drawn to drama is because females are dramatic, i've been around them growing up, so without it in my live or around it, i feel out of place.  Anyway, back on track..i'm kinda tired right now but i dont think i'm going to go to bed at 10pm..who does that?  I'm thinking of putting some little things in this post that happened this semester with myself and other people in my life..and i think i may..in fact..NOW..some things only one or few people will get, so if you dont get it, youre not supposed to and so help me god if you DO interrogate me, you'll "mysteriously" end up with a virus on your comp that will fuck shit up big time. Now...onto the memories.....again..DO NOT automatically think they have to do with me directly..alot of these have to do with other people that I was just around for.  Pam The Cat's room Glitter, Duct tape, Shaving cream Hangin Tough The water pipe The tie Not watching lord of the rings Shot glass Betty What it is Dump the bitch This is John...he's smart..he just sits around and does homework all the time No Doubt Around the world Tell your roommate she's a dumbass 69 is a bad number Stupid Glasses ELEAAAAAAAANORRRRRRRRRRR...I'M IN MY TRAILER..THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR YOU BUT ITS NOT FOR MEEEEE Did he just piss in a garbage can?
