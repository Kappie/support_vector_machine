RabidBunni: not really ShuChoMouff: somebody slipped websense a virus ShuChoMouff: and it freaked out and blocked everything RabidBunni: thats what we were hypothosizing today during history ShuChoMouff: cause the techs are bitches, and they're sitting on their high horses in the tech room saying "Oh, we're so good, websense is the best program ever" and some guy(who i  now i have respect for, although i dont know who he/she is) said "well since you're a bunch of assholes, i slipped you a virus. There, happy, bitches?" RabidBunni: lol RabidBunni: nice  It only half surprised me that the mac students didnt know what the hell was going on/didnt have anything to do with it. I mean, half of them are too stupid to have an opinion of their own, much less write a simple virus that changes DNS signals.  Anyway, enough of that.  God, this is pissing me off. That movie Kill Bill. It's pissing me off. I hate uma thurman, she doesnt deserve to be an action  hero, she looks so washed up in all the previews, and that stoopid yellow jumpsuit looks so stoopid, its STOOPID!!!  I also h8 lucy liu. She always looks cross-eyed, i hate her! she has never had more than like 5 lines in a movie until now, but shes saying stoopid things like "silly rabbit" and "you thought it'd be easy?" "Now let's hear uma thurman bitch about some loser named bill who put her in a kung fu dojo with a really lame yellow spandex jumpsuit and  make her fight some stoopid schoolgirl with a ballandchain."  Then some random cowboy is sitting at a bar sayin "Damn, she deserves that revenge."  For what? God dammit, everyone has tried, but noone can explain this movie to me in a way that doesnt make it stoopid as hell.  You know what other movie is pissing me off? Intolerable cruelty. God, I h8 catherine zeta jones, shes such a bitch, just cause she was in zorro she just turned into some kind of super-bitch.  "oh look @ me, I'm catherine Zeta jones because im a bigot that needs 3 names to feel better about myself, and I'm being a bitch in this movie with cloony, where for some reason he likes me, some bitchy bitch, and cloony tried to get his cloony on, but nooo i had to be all like 'is that all, whore?' and he's all 'you fascin8 me!' but all the while he's got his hand in a dog's mouff and im just standing there looking all bitchy" and i h8 this movie!!!!!!!!!  Yeah, other than that, my legs hurt, and i have a headache. Not to bitch. :-O  Group Dynamix lockin this saturday! WHEEEEE!!! Good, christian, team-building fun!  in that e-mail i sent out, if i were just sending it to us non-adults, instead of "pushin things" i would have said "Kicking ass."  :-O mia, imuh kill laura(or was it linda) for ya when we get there... heheheheh  We should have like a joint-church lockin @ horizon if all goes well.  I'm hoping to get there and see one of my christian-friends and find out he/she is a unitarian, then i can go ":-O!1!! HAHAHAHH!!!" and dance around as i fling dancing monkeys into the crowd.  I don't think they allow monkeys at the lockin, though. Might have to negotiate some koala bears in.  I like that word. Bear. If you say it right, it's funny. kinda like burrrrr, but with a bit of an E in there. beurrrrrhh. No. You'll have to ask me later.  Also! AAHNULD is GUVNUH!!!! !11!! !!1!11!!! !!!111!11! !111111!11 11!!!!1!1  everybody's all pissed off, but i'm just sitting in the back of the political debate room laughing my ass off. I had to listen to this interview on NPR on the way home from school and some kid in china that doesnt know what he's doing ACTUALLY said(translated from chinese):  "Arnold Schwartzenegger is a strong man with very large muscles. I think this is the reason he was elected, because he looks like a man who is strong enough to run a country."     :-O no Terminator 4, baby! I thought i'd never see the day i'd post a picture of arnold schwartzenegger's bikini wax, but i did it to prove a point.  That point is:  Wait... is that a pomegranate? Sorry, I'll have to finish this post later.
