A family friend just built a new house and wanted me and a friend to go rake and weed wack.  We worked yesterday, we worked today, we will work again tomorrow.  That still may not be the end of it.  A "two hour project" is still incomplete after 9 and half hours.  We raked, we weed-wacked, we even mowed, and the yard looked great.  She told us she wanted a few rocks moved so we went out this morning.  We moved a few rocks.  Actually they weren't so much rocks as they were 20 to 40 pound flagstone tiles. It took two hours.  We thought we were done and we felt pretty good.  She came out but there was no" WOW, the yard looks great" or "I really appreciate this."  Instead we recieved the thanks in a rather unusual way.  She told us everything that we missed or did "wrong" and we were told to do some more raking and weed-wacking.  We didn't get mad or even make faces.  We just worked for another three hours.  She returns.  "It is starting to look nice" she says.  That is followed by,"Tomorrow I want the side yard mowed, the front ditch weed-wacked and cleaned up, and meet me at Wal-mart in the morning so we can pick up some mulch for you to put down." "Oh, I also want you to move all of the fire logs up onto the concrete blocks."  Will this work never end?  I suppose I shouldn't complain though, we are getting paid and it is work.  I am so exhausted.  Monday I am going to Springfield to a refresher course.  For what you ask?  Scuba diving of course.  I am gettting geared up for my trip to florida.  I cannot wait.
