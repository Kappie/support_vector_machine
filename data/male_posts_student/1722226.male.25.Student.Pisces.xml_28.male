To my ardent fans this is the event that caused me to get so memorably drunk. This is the event that caused me to rant. I don't think I have been able to get out of this blue funk since then.  At least I haven't been able to get out of it for long. And each time the non-blue funk intervals seem to get shorter and shorter (Chilli funk isn't funky so let it go. Please.).  I'm moving into my new apartment this weekend with a couple of new kids and this seems to have added to the depression. Apparently, when you expect one roommate and you instead get two brand new roommates who aren't your good friend, you tend to be a bit disappointed.  Um...I apologize for the rather muddled grammar and unclear thought in that previous paragraph, but you get my drift.  We rented a car. I drove it around a bit. A little more than a bit. I have found that I actually enjoy driving. This is inspite of the fact that I pretty much suck  as a driver. So I filled the tank with gas, and drove out of town around midnight. Ended up  in the middle of nowhere. Nearly gave a poor dude a heart attack when I ran a red light.  I literally tried to drive away my depression, but it did not work. It left for a while when I rode into town again, but it is now back and worse than ever.    I saw her today at the reception A glass of wine in her hand I knew she was gonna meet her connection At her feet was a footloose man You can’t always get what you want You can’t always get what you want You can’t always get what you want But if you try sometimes well you might find You get what you need ...     I tip my hat to Mick and the boys. Rock on, dudes.  I will contradict myself.   I haven't been in a blue funk all summer.  I have had different, completely independent blue funks with intervals of non-blue  funkness.  Yes, that is better.  Redemption. The world has to redeem itself in my eyes. It can go about this in two ways. Either go through the crap that I have had flung at me, which would mean that this planet earth would have to blow up in a giant fireball. Or make up for the crap with five hundred billion dollars(US) in my bank account(PNCBANK, routing number and checking account number available on request).  This is probably not the right time for me to post anything. I am pretty sure that I am not thinking clearly and that my judgment is impaired. But I do not seem to give a fuck.  I will ramble on.  A new word courtesy of   urlLink  Pearls Before Swine   :  A Rajneeshcentric universe. Ah if it were so, but tis unfortunate that it is not. A tiny unimportant speck is the Rajneesh. The aliens on Grabloyx, do not give a damn about him(Him = me). They are all busy watching "The Bold and the Bractowwoxmok".  A shout out to Chilli's blog. A word I hate: Funda. A phrase I like: "Life, she goes on".  An apology.  This blog will continue to be intensely personal and irritatingly cryptic. I do wonder who would want to waste any time reading the maudlin thoughts of a perpetually spaced out grad student.  I should give you, my gentle reader a trenchant, forthright opinion on the matters of the day, art, philosophy and life. So here goes. Matters of the day: Kerry should win. Art: If it looks like crap, dont buy it. Philosophy:   Life: She goes on.  I can't resist this. What the fuck was the deal with the well and the candle? Please someone do explain that to me.  I used to be cynical and hard. I do remember that. Please, can I go back to that?  The clock has struck four and my eyes begin to shut. I bid thee a fond adieu, gentle reader.   I wait for Starcraft 2.  The cat is actually an alien explorer from Grabloyx.  That's all folks.  Have a great night.
