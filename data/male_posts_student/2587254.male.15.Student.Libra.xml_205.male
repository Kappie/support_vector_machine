The sun shining into my room forced me awake as I couldn't sleep with so much light flooding into my room. So I woke up, and began doing my devos. Today I read about "the seven biblical steps of restoring fellowship." I won't say much about them, but I will tell you what they are:   1. Talk to God before talking to the person 2. Always take the initiative 3. Sympathize with their feelings 4. Confess your part of the conflict 5. Attack the problem, not the person 6. Cooperate as much as possible 7. Focus on reconciliation, not resolution   So I sat there and reflected for 30 minutes or so, and during that time also read some passages from the Bible *mostly expanding on the given verses for each step* and also just trying to figure out what each one meant. At first I didn't really understand 7, but I think I do now. Anyways, after doing my devos in the morning, I then headed downstairs to watch some TV.  Due to the cruminess of afternoon TV programming, I then ate lunch, and then drummed for an hour. Afterewards, it was already 330, and I called Marcello to see when he wanted to go to UCC. Eventually we set a time for 430, so I kind of just moped around for an hour. No wait, no I didn't. For some reason I re-installed SimCity 3000 *though there is SC 4 already* and played that for a while. I don't know why...but point is afterwards @ 430 mom gave me and Marcello a lift to UCC.  Worked out for two hours, then walked home talking to Marcello also.  Came back, played some more SC3000 *it's addictive* and then ate dinner. Now blogging, I am also chatting on MSN, and drinking Orange Juice *yum.* I wonder when WLAC will reply to my e-mail, or when the HYPE dudes will reply about my suggestion of a men's prayer group.  Anyways I'm out for now. Toronto got cancelled for tomorrow, so I don't know WHAT I'm going to do. Tomorrow's grandma's birthday though, so my family's headin' out for dinner anyways. Argh...BUT TORONTO! BOO HOOO ='(. I'll also be missing HYPE tomorrow for dinner *we are painting!* Gah...this weekend doesn't look to bright so far haha.  Oh yeah, and for jokes, you HAVE to go to this. "Saddam Rock Paper Scissors" is HILARIOUS.  urlLink Click Here .  Later.
