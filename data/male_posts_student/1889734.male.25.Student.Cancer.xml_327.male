First off, I hope Dennis Kucinich never goes away.  Let me summarize his platform.  15% immediate decrease in the DoD budget.  Universal Pre-K for all children, free.  Universal free college to every American.  Universal not-for-profit health care for everyone.  Make all colleges non-profit.  Do not allow privitization of Iraqi industry.  Pay reparations to Iraq and pull out in 90 days.  And balance the budget in four years.    The frightening thing was the amount of applause.  I know he isn't a viable candidate, but people were chearing these ideas.  Joe Leiberman proposed a new program called MediKids, which will cover every American child from birth to age 25, even if they are already on a parent's health care.  Dean, between screaming, touted Universal Health Care.   Both Dean and Leiberman can't understand how drugs can be sold in Canada for cheaper than they are sold here, and want to allow import.  Leiberman took care to say he wasn't attacked the products the Drug companies produced, he was attacking thier greed.    To a man, they prattled on about the illegal, immoral unjust Iraqi war.  Wesley Clark had some real wild things to say about how he was a Democrat of Conviction.  He said that while in the military, he focused on taking care of people, and that's what the Democratic Party does - takes care of people.  (Never mind the idea that people should take care of themselves).  Are we electing a President or a Mother?  It was a real freak show.
