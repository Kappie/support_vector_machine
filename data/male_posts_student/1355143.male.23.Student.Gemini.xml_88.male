When Im in the computer lab and I start laughing out loud I get the strangest looks. Oh well though, like I care! Anyway, Timmy, Im so glad about the engagement! Tell the fiancé that I said congrats and instead of sending yall the Cava I´ll just go ahead and drink the entire bottle and think of yall.  So, I have a crush on this French guy that is at the same uni (I cant believe Ive started saying that) as I am. He plays on the rugby team. He had a party at his house and we ended up kissing and now there are pictures of it all over this website (kinda like the fotki one we use).  So this thing is being ghetto and i have to keep writing stuff over and over again sorry if its annoying to read. because im not an UPGRADED MEMBER i can only send comments   Im going to New York City this Friday for my sisters graduation. Itll be good to be in the city for a hot second and then takin it back to Madrid. Instead of going club hopping Ill be going concrete jungle hopping  OK, this is a long comment. Will someone please send me a FUNCTIOAL link so that I can actually post on here instead of writing dreadfully long comments.  Oh yea, Vegard, what is your email address?  if you wanna get a CD get Kayne West... its hot  Ugh, the weather sucks and i dont wanna have to go outside to walk to the metro. blah blah no sun this hell should be freezing over any day now.  Beso, Constance
