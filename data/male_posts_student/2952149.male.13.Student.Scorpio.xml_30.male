I went over to Stacey's house around 4:30 and she showed me around her house and stuff until it was time for the concert. When we got there the line was very long, but hey what can you do. We were able to get close to the stage but once it started Keith and I got caught up in a moshpit and almost died lol. We couldn't find Stacey so we moved to safer territory. Then after the concert was over we cought up with her. She told us that the lead guitarist had givin her his pick which I thought was pretty cool.I had a great time even though......nevermind. Everything else has just been same old-same old. School was REALLY boring today lol.
