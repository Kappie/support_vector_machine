I think I will cry because tomorrow is our last day of school, Friday the 13th, the seniors are gonna end up doing some fucked up shit like last year. Only bad luck lurks around the halls... hense the date... FRIDAY THE 13TH!!! Matt Kaiser is gonna get attacked by Freddy Krooger or maybe Donkey Kong. Ya, sometimes Donkey Kong can be the man... if he tries hard enough. I mean Jesus Christ Mario, you can never reach the top without DK beating the shit out of you just by throwing barels at you. Which reminds me, Donkey Kong Country... amazing game. So anyways, today was gay. I took a test in every god dam class but did good on them all, I think? I saw that 80's Porno security guard again, ya he freaks the shit out of me. Him and his tight 80's clothes... god it's like we wants to be brutally whipped with chains, belts and vanilla flying saucers. Oh, I was reading my sister's magazine "Twist" and it was so funny... you see, this dude, Adith from Florida said every single guy measures their dick every day. I think he's a foreigner from his looks and attempt to act "cool". COME ON JESUS CHRIST, 1st of all I don't use rulers, they don't make them big enough. Second of all, who has the time to measure each day, and is it from back bottom to top or front bottom to top... ok nevermind this penis conversation that I'm having with myself... and the blogger. Let's talk about how crazy ass awesome tomorrow is going to be. Come on, I had no homework tonight and tomorrow all we're going to do is party! I think I might celebrate Santa's birthday. It's like June 29th or something like that. I'll bring in a yarmulke (yamacha, no not yamaha) to show my love for Christians. You know right now I'm just talking diddly squat jibberish British mumble... take Heaton for instance. "So Tom, wiriwj roj3yh ridjow jfoih wfg, with the reindeer name bane shun il il water way?" I think he was talking about a reindeer named Bane who fell off a roof and into a river... but beats me, he's Heaton and he's Heaton. Oh god, remember the time when I was talking about Donkey Kong on my blogger? Memories are sweet. So is revenge. That band I have, yes The Day After isn't working out too good with James and Heaton fighting like little pussy clams. Which makes you think... wtf, I mean, WTF IS A PUSSY CLAM!? It can be something like a hat, or a baseball mit.
