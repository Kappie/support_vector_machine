Syrupy stupid stuff combined with a doomed ship on it's path to death. Take away the ship, take away the syrupy stuff, and you have the best romance ever made. James Garner... I've loved pretty much every movie he's ever been in. He reminds me of Jack Nicholson now with less of a flemsy charachter. Great actor.  ~ George
