     

      I just installed some video editing software at home. What is the most affordable way to transfer from MiniDV to my computer and back to MiniDV or VHS after editing? Do I need a Firewire card or something similar? I'm ready to start practicing and I'd like to be fluent and fast with Premiere (and anything else I can get my hands on.) I'd also love to take  Untitled  and chop it into little pieces and put it back together again.
