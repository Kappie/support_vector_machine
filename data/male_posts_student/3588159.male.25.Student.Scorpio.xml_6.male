His relatives were always making allusions, as vague as they were dark, about his parents and The House. However, the insinuations always stopped short of naming the supposed wickedness. And, Just jealous old people, Alex would shrug. The estate snapshots were what stopped him short, captivated him. When he looked at the pictures, he couldn’t help himself. This is the place they say is tainted? Haunted by grandeur, maybe. And then the deeds of property had been unearthed.  Alex and Sarah had never expected their lives to be perfect. So it was a surprise when the day arrived, and they found themselves waking up in a house built solely for delight. A fire-tipped sunrise flew in the window, and the nagging questions about propriety and their rights of inheritance faded like night mists. It was morning, the first morning, and they were finally there, in a mansion that seemed too Edenic to exist.  There, in the house, (Alex was fond of saying) was everything they could possibly need to be happy. Sarah had been wooed quickly by his eagerness. Now they had taken full ownership, and with expectations soaring, one felt so young! Subsequent days and weeks could only serve to reveal all the ingenious amenities so admired when Alex’s  parents possessed the place.  The residence had been designed for Alex’s parents, and built on a grand scale, with details and flourishes so unique, and yet so fitting and well-conceived, that one could simply enjoy—savor—the place without comprehending the genius beneath each beam and buttress. It was a mysterious work of art. It was a DaVinci or a Michelangelo, the flawless concept hidden by the mesmerizing edifice. It had been like a palace.  There were nooks built into wood-paneled walls overlooking scenic gardens, while a half-turn brought you to blazing hearth and open rafters. There were rooms with windows set so as to catch every ray of the sun, all day, from its rising to its setting.  In places you could be just a step from a crowded sitting room and yet feel utterly private and alone. Another room would feel bustling and festive with a party of just two or three. There were vistas and alcoves to suit every mood and temperament.  Strangely, no one knew the builder’s name, or he would surely have been called back, his work praised, his pockets filled, his mind uncorked and reverently tasted like a wine of rarest vintage. Apparently, his name had died with Alex’s parents. If only someone knew him.  For Alex and Sarah, this desire grew especially pronounced. Alex made inquiries. Then he took out a notice in the paper. The tone of his investigation moved from expectant to baffled to perturbed. In contrast, Sarah fretted after their house’s builder wistfully, longing for his reappearance; she found her mind forming mute petitions. But all to no avail. And their need for the man had become urgent. All was not right with the house. Almost imperceptibly, the imposing creation was growing somewhat the worse for wear.  The house was rambling to begin with, and, as Sarah’s favorite proviso ran, In a place so big it would be virtually impossible to keep everything in perfect order after so many years. It was a good explanation, and they needed one, because, as it turned out, everything was not in perfect order. Somehow, the house was not the model of perfection it had been when first formed.  Their homeowner’s nightmare had begun unremarkably. Gradually, they had become aware of nagging incongruities: the sunshine did not fit the angles of their windows anymore, and Alex struggled to rest comfortably in a bed and chairs that were just inches too small. He did not recall his parents being unusually short. Had the wood shrunk? Had the walls sunk?  Other, darker misfortunes followed. A warped floorboard threw Sarah on her face. Alex stumbled and fell down a flight of stairs when a banister came loose from the wall. Moreover, time passed strangely in the house, sometimes slowly, sometimes with great rapidity. But the moments that crawled were filled with tedium or darkness, and the happy, day-lit moments were fleeting. Mornings and afternoons fled like butterflies but nights stretched on interminably. There was never enough daylight.  Alex’s unrest, now shared by Sarah, was stoked by a growing irritability and flashes of anger that marred his outlook. He would grow frustrated over a loose doorknob or stair, and then bring himself to a flaming rage because he had become frustrated in the first place.  “Who has broken our house?” he would shout, swearing. “And, damn him, where is the builder? I’d like to kill the builder!” Sarah could never fathom why Alex came around to hating someone he had never met.  “The plans must be flawed,” she would reply, reassuring. “There’s no way we could have known.” Inwardly, though, she began to wonder, Why can’t things just be like they were before?  About this time, Alex and Sarah, each took it as a personal burden to examine the house, thoroughly, from top to bottom. Strangely, it was as if the search was one they could not share, could not pursue together. Silent and separate, they immersed themselves in the twisting rooms of the mansion, looking for the tangible source of the disintegration around them.  Sarah’s search led her gradually upwards, scouring each floor of the mansion as she made her way toward the house’s roof. There were some rooms that she did not enter, so ominous and heavy was the air in them. To her horror, she encountered odors of decay; wood crumbled under her feet and once a stair gave way and she narrowly missed plummeting through the floor. “How could this place have fallen so far?” she asked aloud. Then she sat down on the top step and began to cry. “How have we fallen so far? We were so happy at first. We would laugh all day. What has happened to us?” Sarah could not stop weeping. Just then a single ray of sunlight pierced an invisible crack, shining on the wall. Sarah sighed. She stood and climbed slowly upward.   Alex wandered downward. Threading a snarl of passages, he entered a sprawling basement; a bare light bulb hid more than it revealed, and all he could see was the oblong stone that marked his parents grave. He traced the damp inscription…remembered their faces, keen with intelligence, and the bitter accusations laid at their feet over the estate. Meditatively, he kneeled at their grave.  “Bought with blood,” the relatives had said. “We all know how that house was paid off. And things changed after that.” But it was so perfect, thought Alex. He stood over the grave, his thoughts conflicted. If his parents were guilty of evil…what had they done? He brushed grime from the gravestone. Read his parents’ names. And then he saw the second tomb. Shadowed by the wall was a long, low mound. What? His eyes narrowed. Then he began to dig.  Sarah stood on a rooftop. Sun made her eyes smart, wind threw her hair wildly, and she saw, across the valley, what must be, had to be, an illusion—but was not. Another house, lofty, graceful…and so strangely familiar. And standing by the gateway, who was that? Was he waving? Walking closer? She threw her hands up and screamed giddily: “HELLO! HELLOO!” Then she flew down the stairs.             Sarah could not remember the last time she had felt so lighthearted. Holding her skirt in one hand, clinging to banisters, dancing past decaying floorboards, she felt herself smiling. Alex has to know!  Alex had reached the bottom of a very shallow grave. Beneath a sheen of dust lay a few scraps of tattered cloth…rusted metal shards…and nothing else. He leaned back on his haunches, grimacing. There should be more…but the ground was damp, rats lived in the basement…and how much more proof did he need? True then, those surviving echoes: “After the falling out, the builder disappeared…” He kicked at the loose soil and stood. Bitterness flooded his mouth and head. Those, my parents. This, my inheritance! Their blood, their house, now mine. Well…  Alex shrugged. I have always been one to keep what is mine. He laughed, a tinny sound in the cellar vault. And look at this place! The man got what he deserved. He turned, took a swift step. Then another; the door clattered behind him. The light bulb flickered, then bathed the grave in black.  A short time later, Sarah found Alex in the kitchen, a fire lit. The smoke, not escaping through the chimney, was eddying in the room, and it was uncomfortably hot.  “Alex,” said Sarah. “I climbed to the roof! I went outside, and stood on the parapet, and I could see another house across the valley—beautiful; the sun turned it gold. Like this house, and yet…not. I knew we had neighbors, but I’d never seen the place before.” Alex turned, frowning, but said nothing.  “And there’s more. Alex, I know the problem with our house!”  “No,” said Alex softly.  “Alex, the house’s plans are not flawed. Oh, no!” Sarah laughed, but Alex’s face darkened.  “Nothing wrong with the blueprints, Alex. Our problem is more serious than that. Our problem is that—”  “NO!” said Alex suddenly and too loud. Sarah paused, her face clouding.  “Enough, Sarah. If you see the place as flawed, that is your own fault.” Sarah sunk onto a chair, her head drooping, and Alex turned back to the fire. But Sarah’s body straightened.  “Alex,” she said. “We live in the wrong house.”   “No, No, NO!” cried Alex. “This place is my inheritance and it’s our house. OURS.” He had been sharpening a kitchen knife, evidently succeeding too well, for one of his palms was bleeding. “We’ll never leave.”  “Alex, you don’t understand. I saw a man, I think he may be the—”  “Listen—be quiet! I need silence. I need to think. I don’t need your theories, Sarah! Who are you to judge?”  There was a short silence, punctuated by Sarah’s beating heart. Then: “No,” she said steadily. “We need to move across the valley. This is the wrong house.”  Smoke was filling the room. Sarah bent over the fireplace, tinkering with the chimney valve, and as she did so, Alex grasped the newly-whetted carving knife. “My parents did no wrong,” he muttered. Blade ready, he crouched on the balls of his feet. Sarah tinkered. Soot rained down. Then the room sighed audibly, as smoke began to drift upward, and simultaneously two things happened.  Alex took a step forward, swift and silent.  And the doorbell rang.    © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst
