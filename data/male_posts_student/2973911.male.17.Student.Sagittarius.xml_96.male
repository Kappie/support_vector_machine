And others by accidents so unexpected that they still leave us thinking, how could this be happening? But the greatest loss is when one man takes the life of another. The world is at the brink of war. A war that will put countries againsts each other, one religion and another, different beliefs trying to push it's way to the top. It's so sad and so senseless. Everyone cares but the disaster comes closer and closer until everone gets consumed. Forethought will be too late.
