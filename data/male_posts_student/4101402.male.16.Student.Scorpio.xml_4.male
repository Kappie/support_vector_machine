Then, we headed over to Wal-Mart to buy groceries, and then to the mall so that my sister could buy her mother-in-law a gift certificate for her birthday. On the way home, my niece (who is 7 months old) just started screaming and crying for 20 minutes. It was nerve racking.      After the trip with my sister, my mom and I went BACK to the mall to shop for me some school clothes. We bought four shirts and two pairs of shoes, considering that this weekend is tax-free for back to school. However, three of the four shirts didn't fit. I hated that, as the three coolest ones (One with Jimi Hendrix, one with a Mustang Mach 1, and another with a GTO) were the ones that didn't fit. Anyway, I got two pairs of New Balance 574s (black and grey) and a Ralph Lauren shirt out of it.      That's all for today. Be back tomorrow.
