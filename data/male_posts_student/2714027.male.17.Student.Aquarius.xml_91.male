The game plays like an Alpha version that still needs major reworking and polishing up before release, but here it is on our shelves priced at Â£44.99.  The driving sections are okay, but the A.I. is terrible and the on-foot sections are clumsy and unneccessary.  Driv3r  looks like a PSOne game as well, with awful pop-up, bad collision detection, ridged animations, tons of pixilation, bland textures and a low frame rate. It isn't even "all mouth, no trousers", but "all loudspeaker, no legs".  I'm so glad I didn't have to pay for this piece of crap, because if I had, I would be one angry guy.
