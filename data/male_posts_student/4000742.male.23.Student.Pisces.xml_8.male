Just as I was watching an inter-hostel football match under floodlights, and then talking on the cellphone, a kind of insect with a hard shell and pointed legs went into my T-shirt and came out with some difficulty. This happened four or five timesin 15 minutes.Then on the way back to the hostel, I saw abig frogon the pathway. On my approaching, it took a really big jump to clear half the pathway and straight into the bushes on the side. Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong: 'that was a small step for a man, but a giant leap for a frog' :).  Small black light-insects and moths can be seen in the morningin the bathroom and have to be cleared. Even in ourclass, a small frog has dropped twice from the A.C.vent, leading to some commotion.   There also existbig wild lizards here, which people here call by the name ' vish-khopda ', though I have not seenany so far. And then there are snakes. Again I have not come across them and they are probably not venomous (unlike in Surathkal where they could be deadly).
