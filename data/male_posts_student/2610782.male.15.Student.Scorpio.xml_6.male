My sis gave me 3 books just now.Holy.Good books you know?The Bourne identity,Bourne Supremacy,Bourne ultimatum.Don't ask me about price cos...no.1,a good book is worth more than that,you know it.#2)my sis got it for free,its part of her job.No,she doesn't sell books in Borders.  Passing out this week.Passing out parade.Passing out in Parade.Crikes.I've never passed out in parade before,should I try it?Are we gonna go out with a bang or are we gonna fade into oblivion(like our seniors,to an extent,its our fault,nyaaanyaaa).I won't be surprised if our passing out parade is conducted at the school front porch,after all,our juniors think we're a bunch of phoney specialists.Will we party untill dawn or will only a handful of us hang around after the parade?Will we be as one again for the last time?Will I bring my camera and take lots of pictures?I reckon I will.         you are paleturquoise  #AFEEEE         Your dominant hues are green and blue. You're smart and you know it, and want to use your power to help people and relate to others. Even though you tend to battle with yourself, you solve other people's conflicts well.  Your saturation level is low - You stay out of stressful situations and advise others to do the same. You may not be the go-to person when something really needs done, but you know never to blow things out of proportion.  Your outlook on life is bright. You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz            69% Of The Internet Loves Me!
