In singapore, our dreams are you could say mostly of material gains...............the 5 Cs come to mind...............frankly, i haven't any idea what the 5 Cs really are...................i think everyone has their own version................but the main thing is that people buy the lottery bcos they want to achieve their material goals..............thus brings me to a new kai-ism, more like a theory actually..........    "The Big Buang Theory"    The basis of this theory is built upon the fact that people are not born with the desire to make money...........but they are born with their hopes and dreams..................events have to happen that culminate to people feeling the need to make more money to recoup their losses so they can continue on with achieveing their dreams..............these events can be multiple money incurring events or as in my case one HUGE buang of a misfortune...........multiple events can lead to one big accummulative financial incurrence...............however, if a person who can manage to live life away from moola and basically away from the rest the world..........probably in some deserted land or something, would not have dreams of material gains.............
