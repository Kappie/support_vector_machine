But of course no one wanted to have to go get in the car and drive to the liquor store and miss some open bar.  So I said fuck it, open bar would be enough, but Mike kept pushing it.  Of course he didn't want to go and he was being as annoying as he could be.  Then he offered me a 12 pack of whatever beer to go get him a case of bud light.  So i say ok I'll go.  Paul decides to come with me and our dates come along too.  Mike gives us his credit card to use to buy it.  So paul drives down there and we grab the beer and go to the counter.  The guy cards all four of us.  This is when I decided not to use Mike's credit card especially after the clerk made a comment about my name.  I thought i would be stupid for a guy with an unusual name like Ezekiel to then try and use a credit card that had the name Mike on it.  So I just paid cash and figued mike would pay me back.  We go and put the beer in my room because Mike's at the party.  We then go to the party and I loan Mike another 5.00 at the party so he can tip the bartender.  The night continues like usual and no ends up drinking the beer because as I thought we were all too drunk to party afterwards. Fast forward to wednesday night.  I bring up the money Mike owes me and he says he doesn't owe me that much because he said he only asked me to buy him a twelve pack(he said case).  He also said he doesn't have to pay for it because he hasn't drank it yet.  All the beers were in the fridge except for the one he broke and one paul drank.  I continue to get so pissed that eventually I throw a beer all over Mike and leave.  That night I proceded to drink all the beers in the fridge down to his 11 (12 minus the one he broke).  He better pay me my money and he better nefver ask me to loan him anything ever again.  It's bullshit, and it's not like he doesn't have cash.  He just leased a brand new '05 escape and got a $8,000 check for his car.  Can't spare the 30 bucks he said he'd pay me..  bullshit..
