The latter was faster than the former by almost a minute, proving yet again that running with someone makes me run faster.  Not necessarily as far, because God knows I was worn out after that second mile, but most definitely faster.  It's pretty quiet here at work tonight, which I don't mind at all.  I wish I'd brought my Gameboy, though--I'm a wee bit bored.  Found out something rather interesting and amusing this afternoon--Beth has a class with Audrey, the Ozarks graduate who also now attends OU.  Apparently Audrey recognized me at the movie theatre last week when we were watching  The Passion , and vaguely recognized Beth in their class as one of the people with me that night.  It's bizzare just how small the world is, really--I mean, in a school of 30,000 people, two of the maybe half dozen people I actually know here--two people who didn't know each other--happen to both be in the same class.  Craziness, eh?  I think Everett wants me to look at something for him.  My only hope is that I can actually understand the words in it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "I'm Looking Through You"
