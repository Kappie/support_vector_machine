I thought it was good.  You should see it.  There was also a Mock-Trial meeting from three to five; I began to work with Hiro and Ben on Barnes.   Alright Saturday  After a nine-to-eleven meeting of Mock Trial, I went to Asian Culture Night at North.  I was with Loren, Dmitri (Ian's French person), Ian, Brian, and Jonny.  It was a fun experience, but Loren overrated it in his Xanga.  Many of the acts were subpar,  especially  the banter.        "So, what's your favorite movie?"       "I think Bruce Lee movies are off the hook."       "Well, you're in for a treat, because our next act is some fantastic kung fu!"  They're always in for a treat.  It's never like,        "So, do you like martial arts?"       "No, I can't stand them, it's so stupid!"       "Well, sucks for you, because our next act is some fantastic kung fu!"   Easter Sunday  Today, pretty much all that happened was a Mock-Trial meeting, from one to five.  I did my horrible cross, after which I got admonished, but I did do some contributive things.  And then there was the really short blackout, after which the following conversation between Loren and me, respectively, occured:        "It was like for half a second!"       "I know, it was less than a second!"  But I said it refutitively.  If that's a word.
