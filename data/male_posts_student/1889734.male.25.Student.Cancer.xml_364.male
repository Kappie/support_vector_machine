There is an article today in the Pfizer news service from the AP, but I won't copy the whole thing here since it is somewhat long.  Suffice it to say - lawmakers want to force disclosure of all marketing costs expended by drug makers.  Sounds innocent, but it is the first step to stirring up hatred among the ignorant.  The Pharma industry spends $5 billion a year on marketing.  That includes commercials, print ads, swag for doctors and so on.  There is nothing unethical about this.  Lipitor, as an example, has two competing drugs out there, and while the efficacy is debateable with each drug, it isn't clear enough to be a no brainer decision.  Drug makers try to persuade docs of the virtues of their drug.  The more drugs we sell, the more money we make and our employees and shareholders are paid.  That's how it works.  Here's a quote -   Said Lauren Moughon, an Olympia lobbyist for AARP: ``The pharmaceutical industry fears nothing more than a light being shone on their greed.''  End quote.  Greed.  It always comes back to greed.  Drug makers invent drugs because of profit.  These drugs have fantastic benfits to people like Lauren Moughon, yet we are castigated for providing this product and extracting a profit from our labors.  Our production of this drug is not mandated by law.  We don't have to do it.  We didn't have to invent the compound.  The company undertakes a massive risk in developing the drug, and the thanks received takes the form of pillory.  We are greedy for providing a product people want and a cost that covers our expenses and compensates our shareholders.    Another quote -   [President of the Washington State Medical Association] said voluntary guidelines have eliminated some of the worst excesses, but drug companies still spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketing to Washington doctors.     ``Why would they be concerned about disclosing it?'' he said. ``There's value in the public knowing how this money is being spent.''  End quote.  What business is it of the public?  Why is it important?  Financial expenditures are disclosed under SEC rules for publically traded companies.  These rules do not require a detailed breakdown of marketing costs.  The drug companies answer to shareholders, not to the general public.  For someone to have the audacity to speculate that financial information is subject to public scrutiny is amazing.  Does the public have a right to the financial data of an individual?  But this isn't an individual, this is a company that can affect the health of millions you say.  Fine, but the fact that we provide a product that is freely purchased by patients does not expand our relationship with the public beyond any other industry, such as the car makers.  We provide a product.  Buy it, or don't.  It is a simple choice.  Ah, but then we come to 'need'.  People 'need' Lipitor and Detroll and Celebrex.  People 'need' to have cures for ailments.  Does that 'need' magically create these drugs?  Does a patient in pain cause morphine to appear?  Someone has to service that need, and the price of that service is called cost.  'Need' and cost are not dependent upon one another, unless you are willing to pay anything to fullfill that need, which has been demonstrated as no longer true.  People seem to think that their health 'needs' completely alleviate any price that might be attached to that 'need'.  Your need does not compell another person to work or produce.  The money you are willing to pay motivates that other person.  To pretend that your need creates a discount on another's labor is tantamount to slavery.  "I need what you make, so you must make it and accept less compensation than you would receive otherwise.  Get to work."  How long would you work under those circumstances?  What would happen if the producers laughed at the 'needy' and simply put down their tools and went home?  See Atlas Shrugged.  People love to rail against the cost of marketing as being a major factor on the cost of medicine.  According to iMedia.com, the auto industry spent $50 billion in 2000 on marketing.  Ten times what the drug industry spent.  How much does that add to the price of a car?  Will a car save your life?  Will a car reduce your pain?  Will it give you back the ability to pick up your grandkids without pain?  Yet we think nothing of spending $25-40k on a car, spread out in $300-500 payments for years on end.  But a $100 prescription to alleviate a disease is intolerable?
