But it really felt bad that he gave me a 5/10 in our Literature Quiz...well, its just a quiz...but I really felt...um...demoralized [yeah right!]...so there...I wasn't expecting full marks, I would have been so shocked if I did...I'm not as smart in English/Literature as Rina Alfonso or Ms. Lasang is (I don't know if I spelled Ms. Lasang's surname right?! I don't know her first name.)...  But that 5/10 which has the equivalent of D was like telling me that I WAS STUPID...so stupid not to recognize the motivation of characters, the rationale behind the action phases, the conflict hidden amidst those lines...its true that I was not a literary afficionado before I stepped in Ateneo but when in here...It gives me a different perspective...that there are enjoyable forms of literature aside from the popular books and bestsellers that I have read...  So I was thinking that I may not be the expert in these stuff pero I know how to appreciate them na...so if that means that I'm only merit a D, then I have a whole lot of work to do pa pala...well, its not actually Mark's fault...its more of mine pero I was just so pissed off that I didn't speak/recite in his class as I usually do...by throwing off a few lines...  Its just that I thought I deserve more than the mediocre, the mere pass, the D...but if not...I'll have to accept the reality...like many of my classmates in my english block...I'm not that smart...all I can do to these stuff is appreciate them from different vantage points...depending on my mood or feeling...or on how I connect with the discussion...  David is right...not speaking in class does not mean you don't understand a thing...it only means you don't feel like speaking...the things my classmates answers in an English/Literature discussion...I normally have them in my head...I just didn't felt like speaking up or if I did feel like reciting, someone has already said what I ought to have to...  So there...I still like Cayanan as a Lit prof...Its just that I didn't merit a D kanina in our past quiz...pero how stupid of me...  Hehehe...
