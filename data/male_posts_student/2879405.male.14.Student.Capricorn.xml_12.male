RI did expect a win against Marist. But what is the OutCome? aiya...tell you the result now laH its 9-1...who win? MARIS STELLA. Harng-Yi entered the field without a cap(he didn't bring his)and used Jason's cap. Harng-Yi started well by giving the first batter a strikeout, the 2nd batter hit a slow grounder to the pitcher and made easy play to 1st base. It was now that The pitcher started his nonsense again.(you tell me now which pitcher in this whole wide whole doesnt give any balls in the whole game)When it was the Marists' turn to bat, OR JIAO made some excellent+SUPERB+divine GrandSlam.(budden it wasnt really counted as there is only a max of 7 runs that can be brought in but he only brought all but himself)(OR JIAO now crying) This motivated the whole team which brought Victory to the Marist they deserved.(if there was betting...the bookies would make BIG BIG BIG$$) They have now booked their flight to field A to play the 3rd and 4th placing against GMS.~*~Full Time Report By Simhyi~*~
