I dunno, it had JP, now it's got Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, so...  Nothing useful to blog. Oh well. Ohohoh, saw Kerry in town. That was mad. Also saw Liv (Eponine) and to be honest that was mildly painful... I've been missing her a lot, cause I got on with her really well... I've been missing the whole of the cast of Les Mis but Liv the most. She was so great to act, sing, and exist with.
