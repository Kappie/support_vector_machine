We got a good 4 or 5 inches and its still coming down. I might go snowboard later on my little $1 snowboard, LOL. I'm listening to Nas- Book of Rhymes. That is one of my favorite songs of all time! It's great. In my opinion Nas is better than Jay Z, because he speaks real sh*t, and he doesn't have any pop songs like Jay Z has "Change Clothes" and "Excuse me miss" and "h to the izzo". Nas's music is just gangsta, and mostly the truth. Agree or disagree, but Nas is the king of New York.   Alright I'm gonna go let these songs download. Later, -HAZE-
