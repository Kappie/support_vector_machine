I guess I've just got that much to say around here.  So, I went up to work at the school for four hours today, and according to Mrs. Guidance Secretary (remember, I don't use real names of teachers or stuff, since I'm funny that way), I couldn't have done more.  The school's newsletters are headed to students' houses.  ACT 2004-2005 registration packets are all labeled and shelved.  And, they had other minor jobs for me as well.  Monday morning I'm going to be dropped off at the school around 7 or so, and work up until its time to leave for camp.  I got 4 hours of community service today, which brings my current total to 154 hours.  My college resumes are going to look awesome with that huge number.  Most people go to 75 and then stop there.  I think I've mentioned before that I took baseball pictures for the football team last year (EDIT at 4:50...whoops).  That got me about 100 hours of that service.  If I could get this new baseball coach dude to let me help this next year, or, even if I do football pictures or tennis pictures or something else to get large amounts of community service, I'll do it.  The more hours, the better chance I have getting into UCF.  Because, that's the school I want to go to.  Tomorrow I'm going to start making pre-leaving preparations, since dad has to be obsessive over it.  All of the things like mouses, keyboards, mousepads, etc., I'm going to track down and get packed to go.  I'm taking my digital camera this year, so I'll hopefully find some picture ideas for my senior ad.    And, speaking of things related to school, there's only about 3 more weeks of summer, and I couldn't feel any more confused as to if its a good idea or a bad idea.  How could it possibly be good?  How could it possibly be bad?  Tons of reasons, actually.  Good because this summer has been dragging on forever, and the thought of going back to the school and seeing my friends on a more regular basis, it sounds good on paper.  Bad, because I overheard my brother talking on the phone with some of his friends the other night, and he's got some "genius, drug-addict induced plan" to trash my senior year in under 30 seconds, I guess.  I shouldn't worry though, a couple of my friends already want to hurt him, and doing that to me would just make a sure-hit thing.  So, I'm preparing for the worst.    I've been looking online to see when Spiderman 2 is coming on DVD.  I believe its going to be an October release.  I definitely can't wait for that one, if you haven't noticed the large amount of hype that I had over the movie until after it came out.  The movie was perfect.  Many people didn't like it, but I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  Ever.  It got a 4-star rating from someone, and was declared the best superhero movie ever from that Ebert dude.    I'll be back later on for more stuff, including Late Night Bloggin' and something else.  Adios for now!
