However, before that I went to USI to buy books for my exciting class that starts tomorrow (The Middle East), and then to CVS to get my digital pictures printed. There are a couple of spectacular shots, lots of good ones, and lots of bad ones. I willbe posting many of them in the China Report, which I am currently working on. That is, if the upload picture icon that Mitch showed me today actually works. :^D
