From the transition from Secondary school to that of JC life, not only academic stress but even stress from CCAs has increase tenfold! Normal daily homework coupled with CCAs has made life hectic and at times depressing... haiz... i don't know... i guess, really had to fine tune myself at 1st... finally after 6 months, i have finally more or less gotten used to JC life... waking up early, going through the whole day of school, ending of school at 430 all the way to having CCA to latest 9+... it is now a common and simply part and parcel of my life... truly, it's not as easy as it seems... certain points of time, i tend to crack under the pressure and strain, fatigue sets in and i simply blow! An example? just today, during E1 lesson, i just blew my top and slammed Brian's stuff on the table simply cause i was frustrated... yup... i guess, i scared some people with the sudden outburst and i apologise about it... REALLY REALLY SORRY! Sorry...  Anyway, besides all this, there is the need to change of attitudes, behavior and action in the mix school... after 10 years of single sex school, stepping into the era of mix school was 1 hard process for me. Actions, words, behavior had to be toned down, disabiling me from being the real me. Indeed, there are times whereby i wish that i was still in the single sex school system, but... nevertheless, mis school has it's merits! One of which is that you get to be more open minded about many things and get to understand the opposite sex much better. Well, for one thing, i love this system now cause, i've developed a more sensitive side of me... knowing the dos and don'ts in front of girls, giving me the chance or rather the knowledge of coping with the real world in future!  okok... enough enough... well... Let's move back to the present. haha... Michelle was really scared that i jio Xiang Hong lah! haha... wah lau... am i that bad?! haha... well... all i said that i liked Xiang Hong's blog and she was like, 'You like Xiang Hong?!' wah lau... come on lah, my dear mei, i am not that bad lah... and please loh... do you think i really am that much of a casanova... i admit i was once like that lah... but... i really am not like that in real life lah! it's just a fake side of me! grr... okok... anyway, no lah... it's not like i don't think Xiang Hong is bad or anything, in fact i think she is a wonderful girl! but... nah... i don't think things can develop between us besides just good friends... that's all! aiyo... so... please hor...  haha... ok... another thing! please lah! i am not like some super flirt lah! haha... those stupid friends of mine ah... all i did was say hi and talk to... ok... quite a number of girls... and they were like... teasing me all the way lah! wah lau... guys, GROW UP! grr... hmm... furthermore, Valarie is my good jie mei lah... so... yeah... don't anyhow say lah! wah lau... in my heart... i only got 1 true person... but... i am not going to say it here lah... it's really simple and actually, if you are observant enough... it's damn obvious... so... yeah... let's leave it at that lah...  okok... that's enough... erm... Oh yeah! Amy is quite sweet lah! i don't know why i said that, but... yeah... she seems that way... and NO... please ah... don't start scandalising me again... i just think she looks great and is really quite a fun person lah! haha... while we were having PE, playing soccer today... she was damn ON lah... until she got tired i guess... than, she, Cheryl and Audrey simply stood at the goal post and refused to budge as well as refused to open the goal up bigger! grr... but nevermind, we still drew with 3 guys vs 11 girls lah! haha... anyway... yeah... she seems like a great girl! ok... that's it i guess with regards to her at the moment... never did spent much time talking to her yet... cause... so busy lah...  hmm... ok... what else? nothing much lah... but... simply wish to make our class bonded together soon enough... i mean, if it means embaressing me... i don't mind... cause... i believe that class bonding is really essential for a condusive studying environment! heex... also hope that i can be the Chairman or president of the Chinese Orchestra... ok, i got to go liao... hope to make more friends and know present friends better to! Peace! (that was so lame!) Smling day in, day out! :p
