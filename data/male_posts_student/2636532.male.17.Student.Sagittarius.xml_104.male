It's a magical little device that allows one to actually CHANGE what has been posted, mind boggling I know! And poor ignorant him not knowing that people have been paid to do this, if he had taken the time to read the blogger main page. Indeed, he is still wet behind the ears but I think that once he gets used to it everyone will show him the same respect that I do...hmmmm...Alright I lied, I don't respect him, but when he gets bitchy it is fun to argue just to see him get mad, it's hilarious, imagine a little bird that's puffing out it's chest it can't do anything other then huff and puff, and then you poke it and it snaps but actually acomplishes very little. that's Errol alright, funny to look at. -Matt
