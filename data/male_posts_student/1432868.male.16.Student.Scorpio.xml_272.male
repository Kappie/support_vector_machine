Pirates went well but in Chicago the percussionists screwed up rather badly (Kill the drummer!!!) my parents were rather impressed by the overall asianess of the group though heh heh  Senior bios were (mostly) cool. Mostly funny, some not so funny...some looked like they were written by a 10 year old. now where was I...oh yes...the seniors. It's gonna be sad to see them leave  but I least I get to do I couple more cool things with them. Diana Keung and Jeremy Feldbloom are having a small concert (classical) day after graduation. Also, the orchestra is playing all ceremonial music for graduation so we get to send off the seniors too ^_^ It's been a long day g'night
