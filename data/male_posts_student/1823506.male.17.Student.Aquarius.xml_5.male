Than back home because I forgot one of my shirts, than back to Germany again. I was staying in a hotel with a lot of other people I know. Megan and Stephanie from Rotary, Sarah B, Nick, and a few others I can't remember. Everyone in Germany spoke English, and I was frustrated because I couldn't practice my German. There was a Best Buy down there, and I did some serious camera shopping. I also remember waterslides of some sort.
