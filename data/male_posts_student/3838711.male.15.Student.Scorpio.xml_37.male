And I figured out my physics retest would be postponed (YET AGAIN) to maybe thursday... since the time of the test takes up the whole physics lesson plus half of geography... haha..  Still stayed at home the whole day with my dad, didnt do much, just slacked around the com and did some stuff of packing up my table, gonna finish the job in these few days before I study for my common test next week. Figured I'll study better in a neat environment. Everywhere's dusty and all... I need to do a big clean up before I hit the books, else I'll be sneezing all day...  Saw a few peepz online, actually felt like msging them, but in the end I didnt, maybe its because I'm outta words to say, or maybe I need some time alone. Didnt know how to start the conversation going. Bleah...  Asked Aaron out for dinner in the afternoon, he somewhat made it sound like its a interrogation... says that I have no choice. I must go, and musnt put him on an aeroplane. I was like kinda puzzled as to why he would say that.... Ah well, its over, I couldnt make it, and he couldnt either, having some OT till 6.30pm.. otherwise he'll be the one putting me on an aircraft. Phew.  Parents gone to the funeral, and me, all left at home. But I guess its a good thing, some silence in the house. At least this time my mind didnt run wild, but I just felt like a empty nut, sitting there, staring at the screen... My mind in a blank.  Concluding my day, I would like to add, my mood still hasnt changed for the better, still feeling down and lonely, but oh well, as if there would be someone waiting for me after school.. Or me doing the waiting...  Its just me, walking home, alone.
