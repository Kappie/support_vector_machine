It's been a great weekend, I got to hang out with some old buddies that I don't hang out with that much these days. I realized today I have been hanging out with the same old group of friends too much, and my relations with them have been taking a turn for the worse. I am now on a quest to find some new friends so I can give myself a break from the regular group of friends when I need it.   Now I'm sorry If you feel like I complain a lot.. but.. hey! Why should I care what you think? This is my creative outlet, is it not? Complain mode activated.  List of things I don't like: 1) People who don't respect me 2) People who mock my religion 3) Not swinging during parades in band 4) Homework 5) Movies that end halfway. Damn the movie industry.
