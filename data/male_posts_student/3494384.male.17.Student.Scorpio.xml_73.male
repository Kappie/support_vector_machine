The fan is stopping and the sound starts... Damn irritating. Cannot help it so must go and switch off the PC. Cant imagine what will happen if the motherboard is overheated or something.  Am on a diet. Didnt ate anything in the morning and afternoon. Only ate my dinner. Seems like everything is going well. Cannot be lure by foods again. This is the time to be on diet for me because I'm broke. So I'm actually hitting 2 birds with 1 stone.  I must get my weight down. I must. Cuz it's for someone lorhz... :D Shall slim down to 60KG. Hiaz... Plan is to eat a little bit for breakfast. Dont eat anything for lunch and eat lesser than average for dinner. Maybe I'm going for some runs also. Cardio exercise will helps. :D  Plans for tomorrow? Go back to school. To scan some stupid pictures for my NMM project. Sickening. Also got to return all my library books. Is so troublesome.  just recieved word that my new computer will arrive in 3 days. Cant wait for the new computer to arrive. No more lousy computer for me.   :: 我不相信 都动了感情却到不了 爱情 那么贴心却进不了 心底 :: :: 你能不能快一点决定 对我说我爱你 ::
