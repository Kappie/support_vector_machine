So what I spent my time doing on this glorious, yet not optional occurring, occasion was I went and hit baseballs for a while.  If you've been following my blogs then you realize that I am a baseball fanatic.  Another win for the 'stros last night!!!!  My buddy Gabe came to town, and he and I went out and hit.  That was fantastic.  Yesterday, I did however have to fill out a renewal for my financial aide.  You know filling out forms about your taxes, life, your parent's info, it would be a nightmare to do all the time, which is why, I suppose, that my parents always made me fill out my own shit.  I guess it teaches self-reliyada yada yada. So now I have decided something after a heart to heart with my buddy Gabe.  I realized that I am completely and irrevocably blind to the common flirtations of a woman towards me.  I have always known that I am slight impervious and unaware of such things, but after last night I realize that I basically question flirtations if they are biting me on the lip.  How do I learn to become more aware?  I feel that my senses are working fine.  I just need a good girl friend of mine to work on it with me.  I sound hopeless.  A 23 year old person with absolutely no idea of how to pick up on girls at all.  No I am not gay.  I talked the other night with a girl that I would consider to be the coolest girl to date.  Her name is Joanna.  I have always had a thing for her, that thing extends beyond sheer physical attraction.  Her and I have always had the best conversations, she is intelligent, witty, and of course beautiful.  She lives about 13 hours drive away from me, which kinda give me this distorted view on the distance.  I have a crazy idea to just get up and drive sometime when I have about 4 days off.  She would be worth it, she always has been.  This journal stuff is making me feel better everyday.  I guess I just need to get stuff out like this more often.  I will hit this again later, prolly tonight.
