I do like being by myself, and with people, it really doesn't matter to me. Although for me its more that I don't trust people enough... sometimes thats a good think i guess.  Perhaps it's why nobody reallly really knows me.  Anyway, I haven't been home since 7:10 this morning.  Of course i went to school but then I wen't to jeremy's house with kelsi and we worked on our cardboard mirror (kelsi wanted to put Der Spiegel on it but we wouldn't let her... it means the mirror in german) and then jeremy dropped us off at the HS again and kelsi sold concessions and I waited for 2 hours and did homework waiting for pep band at 6:30.  I got home at 8 something.  How interesting huh?  Anyway I should go now.  Later guys
