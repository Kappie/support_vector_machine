The one who puts the water on second will get the hot water, and the other on will lose it and get the shower to pee out cold water. I noticed that when I lost the hot water to my neighbor, if I turned the water off for like 15 seconds, I would gain the water back. I think the neighbor noticed this too so we were like turning the water on and off; when I lost the hot water, I could hear my neighbor's water knob turning. It was really fun, we spent all of my time in the shower fighting for the hot water. I don't know, I think that's the highlight of my vacations and it made this day much more fun than I thought it wuld be heh. La!
