That means we traveled an hour away on the bus to play three pieces of music in front of three old guys so that they could rate us. We also got to play two pieces of music we had never seen before today and get rated on how well we played those. Anyway well the rating system goes from wort score to best as follows: poor, fair, good, excellent, superior. For the past few years we have been making goods and last year we barely pulled off an excellent rating overall. This year however we got a new band director and we got not only an overall superior rating but got straight superiors every single judge gave us a superior rating it was awesome. This means we can go to state concert festival and this is the first time our concert band has   ever   gotten straight superiors in its 50 year life. So if you couldnt tell im kinda excited. Well its gettin late ill talk to ya later.
