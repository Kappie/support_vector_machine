Woah, today the market and Shop N Save was terribly crowded. I guess everybody's buying their last minute goodies. I guess they won't want to buy too early because it won't be fresh. Yeah. That's why everyone buys now la. Heh. We brought some kuehs and buns (for tomorrow's praying) and flowers. O.o! The thorns are terribly pricky (duhz).   We came back at 10, and at 11, Dad called. We are going to Woodgrove's NTUC to buy some kum (mandarin oranges). HaHa. We also brought a lot of fruits and more buns. O.o The kums turn out to be not suitable to pai nian, ahhh, whatever la. HaHaHa.  After that leh, we went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. I ate the hotplate beancurd rice thingy. Nice sia! After that, we went to market again We brought more kueh (again? HaHa...look at the hassle of CNY. I enjoy it though. Heh.). Then, we went back lor.  HaHa. I tell you hor, I slept for 5 hours (from 1-6). I just laid down on my mother's bed, closed my eyes, and just slept lor. Pig right? I think I was very tired. Or extra sleepy. Meow moo! I dreamt a lot of dreams. The most interesting on is that me and my 8 siblings (fictional) were jailed for 9 years for stealing a secret formula of a scientist (must be that report I saw in TNP!! There's a report on someone drugging a scientist today)!!  HaHa. I was like hugging my eldest sister and the police officer (I said "you were a great officer". She replied with "you have a great would-be-prisoner". Crazy dream!) before I went into the jail. I remember it being very spacious, and before I know it, a year passed and me and my siblings celebrated. HaHa!! I forgot the rest le la...I got so many dreams.   After waking (and stopped dreaming silly dreams), me and Dad went to 768 to eat dinner. I ate fried rice, he ate pork ribs noodles. We also brought some plates (for the altar thingy) and some vegetarian thingy for praying. Woah. So many things!   We came back, I bathed and watched some TV. SL asked us to go back to RSS tomorrow to look at the celebrations and pay visits to our teachers. HaHa. I want to visit Mrs Chew leh. See what the others say first la. Hmm....  Okay, I gotta get going le. See ya tomorrow! CNY is gonna be here soon! So exciting!! Night blog!
