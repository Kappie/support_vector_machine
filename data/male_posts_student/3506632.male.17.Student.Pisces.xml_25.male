Initially I thought that the men were of the Frontier Constabulary and there might be some Jirga going on in the vicinity. Only when corrected did I realize that the men were there to prevent the entry of Jamaat e Islaami Amir, Qazi Hussain Ahmad, into to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Talk about double standards.   Anyway at the other end of the Agency lay the Kohat Tunnel dubbed as the Friendship Tunnel by I don’t know whom. At first sight it awakened some of my hard sleeping memories of being in tunnels; though the refresher has not potent enough, still I enjoyed the unique reverberating sound that is produced in such confined places. Surprisingly enough, the access roads were of good quality something that might be due to the tunnel being in its pristine years, or perhaps the contractor really was honest and good. Another point worth note about the tunnel was the large announcement saying no one is exempted the tax; though the constitution does allow exemptions on toll tax, which was also applicable on my conveyance and I was thinking whether the tax would be adjudged as toll or what. Finally at the collection point we were let straight through making a mockery out of the notice (at least that’s better than making a mockery of the constitution as was the case at Sang Jani Toll Plaza some years back).   At Kohat Cantonment there were two rather amusing things. First an advertisement of Rescue 15 stating amongst its services free registration of FIRs (as if it’s supposed to cost) and the other which was looking strange were the roads around Kohat Fort which houses 9 Div. The roads themselves weren’t all that funny, unlike the ad, but there being in a state surrounding something that is supposed to be a heritage site looker quite anomalous.
