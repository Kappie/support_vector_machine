"Why do i have to do the dishes again tonight!?" "Why can't i have some candy!?" "Why does there have to be so much hate in this world?!"      Many different kinds of people use the word why as well, from your 3 year old who has just begun to start talking, to a middle aged person, to a senior citizen.  This word is not limited by age, as some are, such as "mommy", even though it would be one of the first words you ever use.  How is such a powerful word so small, and seemingly insegnificant?      You may ask, where am i going with this train of thought?  Well, to tell you the truth, i have no real reason for blogging about this... well, maybe one, but that i cannot mention.  I know every single human has uttered the word why once, and probably many more times than that.  Its a necessity of life so to speak.     When you hear your toddler saying why all the time, does it not annoy you?  Yeah, probably, because he/she is asking why about everything.  One thing about that word, you don't have to use it if you trust a person.  Thats the beauty of it.  If you trust your mother when she says something to you, you don't ask why, you do it.        Why trust someone? You trust someone because they have shown you that they can do something for you without fail.  If your friend is forgetful, you can't trust them to remember to bring something for you.  Its just the way things work.  If someone fails you time and again, you can't trust them at all, because they never come through for you.  It doesn't take saving a life to earn trust, just do little things for that person, and eventually, they will  begin to trust again.      I want to take this space to give a shout-out for a very special person in my life, Tan.  I met her 3 days ago, after her randomly pming me on gaia asking to chat.  I never thought anything out of it, but i found a person very similar to myself.  I consider her my soulmate ^_^ Shes great: a funny person to be around, she can bring a smile to your face, i love talking to her.  Here's to you Tan!    Lates
