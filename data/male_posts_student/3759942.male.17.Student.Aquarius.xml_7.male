Few days back...I received this grieving news that My dear Mr Kamikazhe had left CM for other 'Particuliar reasons'And i know what those reasons are..Its so freaking obvious...  Wait I will show you guys what My Dear Mr Kami (Im not being sarcastic yah) Typed in another Forum..  "Ok, not much talk cock, I'll make it quick.  After taking a look at the irc topic, I believe that CM requires a reformation, and I think I'll get in the way, therefore me, Kami, have decided to quit CM. I've notifiy leader of CM, Kerplunkz and he've approved it.  --------------------------------------------------  Guys who've been with me since WZ era, thanks for playing with me :D I've always enphasized fun in DOD, never to think of competitive, though I know that CM is going for competitive. But you guys' the best :D Gotta miss you guys :D and Gd luck for the competition!  I couldn't attend training all the time is another thing that I've considered my decision to quit CM. You know, I gotta prepare for NS, gotta understand my tight schedule of gym and exercises...   Another reason could be due to relations with some of the CM members, though I think I should just put everything aside...  1) Thanks kerp for accepting me in in the first place ^_^ You guys are fun to play together with, like I say in the first place ^_^  2) Fett, you're the best :D  3) Ber, you're the best too :D  4) Opio, you gotta understand that my lappy requires a fan and sometimes my mic generates fan sound cause my "big" fan is behind me, but dun you think you shouldn't put it in a sacarstic way? (Majiam you hear fan sound = Kami like that) ^_- That turns me off alot... I mean, ALOT...  5) The 3 scrooge, Asssssshhhlee, EEEEEEEeeeeeed and Doraemon lol... gtg liao, glhf ^_^ hope to chat with you guys again  6) Beef, live the life to the greatest ^_^   7) Finally, to myself.... "Wtf are you doing, recruit!? DROP 20 now!" gd luck to my coming NS life! Can't wait for ORD LOH!  Yours sincerely,   Kaptain KamiKaze  "  Yes...Pretty Touching and depressing yah...I understand. In fact Mr Kami...If your Reading this, I sympathise with you. At the same time, I envy you for getting yourself out of this shit. Well done. Whatever it is, I wish you all the best in what ever you do in the future...  Yes yes...Back to Reality.. The problem now is that More and more Members are leaving...Apparently, Miya ( Best Sniper Ever ) Left |[CM]| yesterday...Why..Bascially the same reasons...Worst to come, Nessa and Dreamix will be leaving soon. I mean they are in the same CS clan anyway, probably plotting the downfall of |[CM]| every now and then ( Kidding.. )  And minutes ago...Luhao my good pal Complained to me, Cursing and swearing...At Boss.Reason? MISCOMMUNICATION! AS SIMPLE AS THAT.  Future, myself aHaH and Doraemon Will be leaving as well..Theres simply no more future/potential in |[CM]| anymore...  Well Done |[CM]|...POOR MANAGEMENT...
