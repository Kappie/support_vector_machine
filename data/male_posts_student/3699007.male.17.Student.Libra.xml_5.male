It is good 2 AM music, very relaxing, as is Warren Haynes acoustic, by the way.  I already have all of my online work done for today (Friday) so if I need to go out and do something (hopefully I will...be damned if I sit at home on a friday night) then I can do so.  It only took me about 20 minutes to do, which is cool.  Oh how I love probability.  And as I do it, the probability of me passing this God-awful class also rises.  Random rant: Damn Michael Moore and his Farenheit (that is how I will spell it because I don't know the real way) 9/11 movie.  Quite honestly, I don't know very much about what it's about and the previews shown on TV where Bush is playing golf actually look decently funny, but Michael Moore is still a fat pompous asshole.  Perhaps somebody should have made a movie about Bill and Monica WHILE he was in office.  I guess there aren't too many Republicans in Hollywood.  The damn leftists in Hollywood attack all the oil prices and some even attack the use of oil because it pollutes the environment and damages the ozone layer (I have yet to understand how a permanent hole can be cut in something made of gas), but I'd like to know what they think powers their private jets and delivers their cocaine to them?  (Thanks Anne Coulter!)  Well, I guess that's all for now since I can't think of anything else to write about.  Hopefully me and Britt will get to do something tomorrow, errr...today.  I think I'll call him and ask him if he wants to see Farenheit 9/11, to which he will likely respond with something to the effect of "I'd rather masturbate with a cheese grater."  I whole heartedly agree.  Y'all have a good one.  Sweet dreams.
