U either appreciate him and in that case perfect.  But most times its not the case, you start taking advantage of his "head over heels for u" bit and u kinda make him do whatever YOU want.  Reality check ladies just cause we're "Head over heels" for u doesn't mean we are your slaves.  We only do it because we love you so don't abuse it.  Treat us like your opposite half.  Give us love.  Treat us with respect.  Don't make a joke outta us so you and your best friends can get a good laugh cuz 1 of these days we're gonna explode and you're gonna be the 1's suffering.
