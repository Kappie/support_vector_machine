Will the people who care for me leave? Will I be alone? So many questions,so many answers I need to know  Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy
