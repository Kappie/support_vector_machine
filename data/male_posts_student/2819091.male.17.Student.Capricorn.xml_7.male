Did the fates just make us meet each other, to make me so deeply in love with her, so that they could laugh at me for how horribly pathetic I am?  Damn them...  From now on, why can't they just leave me alone?  I must try not to be infatuated with the opposite sex any longer, I've already learned my lesson.  Time to move on, time to finally realize that I was meant to be alone.  I was fortunate enough to have been given friends but as for partners, I believe I was never granted that privilege.  That's why I am currently nay, no longer attracted to anyone.  I still am attracted but I know that I could only admire from afar or else doomed to see someone I am in love with leave my life again.  This is my destiny, to walk this damned path without anyone else but myself, this is the destiny I choose.  The Path of Nay...
