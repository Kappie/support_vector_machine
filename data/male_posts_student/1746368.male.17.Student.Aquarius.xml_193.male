I don't really want to tell much about it until I can put the pictures up and show you guys a little bit of what I did and its a half an hour until 11 and I would rather just sleep!  I had a decent time there. I will go more into depth tomorrow when I get on the computer. I think Derek is going to work early tomorrow so I will be able to get on whence I wake up.  I'm back on the computer so expect to see me online.

I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.  Rose: You're crazy!  Jack: That's what everybody says, but with all due respect miss, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here  --Titanic
