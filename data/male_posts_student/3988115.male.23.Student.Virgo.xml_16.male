Hopefully, he won't get an administrative discharge because of drug abuse like another good friend of ours.      Anyway, I was doing some "web surfing," as it's called, and stumbled upon this  urlLink book  that pretty much sums up, I believe, what Jason is going through.  Hell, maybe the next volume will include one of Jason's stories.    OOH-RAH!
