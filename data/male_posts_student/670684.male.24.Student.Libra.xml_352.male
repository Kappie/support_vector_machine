Bruce wrote  Video  and  Clean, Clean , the two big Buggles hits (I bet none of you have ever heard Clean, Clean), with Buggles' frontman Trevor Horn in 1979.  Here's where it gets tricky, because there's no info on this as I can find yet, but there must be a split, because Bruce Woolley has his one hurrah with The Camera Club quite soon thereafter.  The Buggles also put out an album, albeit a bit later.  However, their hit played paramount, and I wonder how much of it had to do with a music video.  Bruce Woolley fell off the earth, and Trevor Horn is forever remembered as the perm-ridden, four-eyed bass player with the soothing voice for the dawn of music television.    More as I find out.
