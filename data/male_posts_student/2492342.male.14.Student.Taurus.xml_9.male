I MEAN, I KNEW THE FIRST 8, BUT THE LAST THREE...NO IDEA. ahh i didnt want that in caps. oh well..  Oh yes, and to make it all better, an angry brighton has a laptop in australia. What the hell!!!!!!! I mean, I wish I could get on the internet on vacation..but still. I hate this. I hate my life. I myself. Yeah, my life's ok. But I'm not. I screw everything up. *shoots self*. wait- lets say it in spanish! *le dispara a su propio*yay.   Nothing's gone well the last few days, that's for sure. And little things people did didnt make it any better. That's for sure. It's good to know at least AISHA wont get pissed at me for little things. Or flirting or crap. I felt all special today. I wore this new black(the bets color ever) shirt my dad bought, and it was all cool. ANd I was happy. And i slept in. Taht was good. ANd now I'm alone with a teacher. Crap. Jeez..that cared me. She turned around and asked me if I was doing a blog. I thought she'd get mad or something. At least she wasn't. I guess we can do whatever we want in our freetime here. Except porn. Damn. SOrry, aisah, can' open the pics of yourself u sent me. lol j/k  Im gonna go over to kimerly's house after school and watch degrassi at like 5. I need to get out before all of leilas friends come over. And then I'll be alone!!!! I'll probably call Aisha, dnce in the nude(my fantasies are all coming true), read somehting and get depressed, talk to aisha som more, think about everything wrong in my life, talk to aisha about it, think about why Brighton's still mad at me, keep talking to aisha in confusion. Sounds like a night!!!! I wanna stay up til 3ish, cause I always get a better sleep that way. And I want the other shower cap.  And I don't wanna be a lone. but oh well. "that'll do, pig."  I felt persian today. Cause the black made me look darker and more..me? er what i wanna be, and my air was all perfect(in my eyes) so I felt good, for once. I watched music videos at lunch with Sam. They were'nt that good. SOme were though. "money' by pink floyd is not a good song, if you ever wondered about it.  You think posts from a long time ago get rolled off on this? I hope not. Tomorrow I'll have been writing a week! :)  Aisha....a picture. not of kitty, but of the other person in your room at 1 AM. And, once again, not that i want it ro anything, for the reasons previously mentioned.  Liked your email. It was sweet.  I don't remember getting any sweet email from Brighton, hm? lol  Much love  peace  ~alex
