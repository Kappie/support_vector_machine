Let me just recap my day today (it is a "B" day).  Before school: The other night, I had finished the fifth "Left Behind" book:  Apollyon . I thought it was pretty interesting, but I wanted to finish it fast because I could go into my english class having finished two books. It was pretty great. Over the past week, I have finished 5+ books. I read pretty fast, but I don't really notice it, usually. I went next door to see if they had the next book. Eureka! They did. The next book is called Assasins. It is pretty cool.  Math: Well, I did all the homework before he was done explaining it, as usual. *YAWN* boring, so I read for the remainder of the class, while occasionally making a few sarcastic comments on little snippets of conversation that I hear.   English: Sometimes I wish I took a foreign language, just so I could type this section in a different language. Anyways, I was bored in this class also. He assigned more reading. Since I have read the book completly, I needed not to read. I answered the questions and I didn't really talk the rest of the day.   Lunch: After dropping my things of in biology, I went over to our new spot. If anybody goes to Livermore High, this if for you. We used to sit back in front of the bathrooms right next to the practice football field, but now we moved! If you walk towards the 300  400 buildings and turn left (right away), you should be going down this section of sidewalk with an overhang just ahead. That is where we sit now. We have our own seats on the side, and our own backrests. It is pretty snazzy.  Free period: As I was making my twice-thrice weekly pilgramage to the shopping center that I meet Dominique at, I was anticipating what might happen on Thursday. I am so excited for it. It is the second meeting of the Christian Club (Ignited Youth) and I really want to go. I already like it, and I have only been once. I can't wait to see what God is going to do in my life, because I know he wants to do something. Anyways, I met Dominique and Samantha for lunch and they kept on flicking me and poking me and occasionaly elbowing me. I started to leave but Dominique guilted me into staying. To tell you the truth, there is no place I would rather be than with Dominique.   Biology: Grrr, sometimes this class makes me upset. I don't like having homework every night. One of my friends from Ignited Youth is in that class. She is pretty cool. We knew each other before Ignited Youth, but we didn't know each other was a Christian. That's not good, we should be telling the whole world, but instead we keep it to ourselves. Anyways, she and I talked during the lab, and she goes to Sunset. Now if any of my oldest readers remember, that is the church Dominique went with to the summer camp. That is really weird, because Abbey (the girl, I am not sure if that's how you spell her name) went also. She met Dominique there. Supposedly Dominique talked a lot about me, so Abbey knew who I was. She knew who I was, and my name, she just didn't connect the two. That is really strange. Anyways, apparently now she knows me more "personally" although I highly doubt she knows me as well as half my friends. Anyways, yea, that was pretty much the extent of the excitement in biology.  After class: Abbey and I left class together and started talking a bit. I kept on dropping my poster I have to do for biology. I got in my car and left for home without another thought. Then, I got home, and realized. I forgot my skateboard in biology. I am going to have to get it in the morning. Not really a big deal since I am going to go in through that way anyways. I will just nab it before I go in. Nobody should take it, and if it's not where I put it then I will ask the teacher if she saw it sprout legs and leave.  Well, that's it for now. Oh, the "Site o' the day" is a Piers Anthony fan site. He wrote the greatest series ever to grace the planet. The "Xanth" series. It is great. If you love reading, I highly recommend it. Especially if you find some of the things I say funny, he has the same sense of humor I have...or do I have the same sense of humor that he has, *PONDERS*. Anyways I just want to leave off with a good english essay writing tip: Don't never use a double negative in a sentence. TTFN.
