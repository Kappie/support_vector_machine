I sure am, and now, a new program can help eliminate that problem.  Leech Get 2004 is the perfect solution to help you get your downloads (your legal downloads, like pictures, America's Army, etc.) without the hassle of having to restart everytime your connection gives out.  The program allows you to stop, resume, and pick up downloads from where they stopped, just in case your connection goes out.  If you have to get offline, you can stop the download, and resume it when you get back online.  It's compatible with Internet Explorer, however, there is a patch that allows Mozilla, Netscape, and Opera users to join in on the action, which allows for a bigger userbase, since Mozilla is quickly becoming a popular browser.  You can even set up a download without going to a browser, provided that you know the download's URL, and can use the setup wizard very easily.    This program has a mild difficulty curve, but only if you decide to set up without going to a browser.  I tried setting one up without my browser, and I just didn't like it.  It takes forever for the download to start, as well.  It goes through a long, long creation process.  It almost seems like it would be easier and faster to use your regular download manager, but, you can't stop your downloads in those without having to restart from the beginning.  Other than that, it is very, very easy to use.  It features an Outlook-like interface, which is also easy to use.  Dialup users, this is your chance to get big downloads, like America's Army (which I'm downloading now).  Once you get past the mild difficulty level, this thing is very easy to use, and I'm not sure if I can recommend it, because this thing can freeze your computer...alot.   Pros  +Allows you to stop and resume your downloads. +Perfect for long downloads +Perfect for 56K users   Cons  -Mild difficulty level makes this a little bit hard to use for people who don't have the right computer skills. -Freezes your computer WAAAY too much   Score  Easy to Use?: 75%-C Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 65%-D Customization/Controls: 85%-B Final:  80%-B Silver    Up Next: Game of the Day- Glinx!
