That's right,I am posting here instead of lying in bed with my beautiful SO. My head hurts and snot is leaving my body at an alarming rate. This is total rubbish. I hate being ill. I'm used to dealing with massive life threatening illness, I've been doing that my whole life, it's the piss ant coughs and colds that really get me down. There is nothing to be done except feel like shit until it decides to go away. I know this might seem strange but when you are seriously ill (as I have been on occasions to numerous and dull to count) it is much easier for me to cope with. No, I'm not some psycho nut nut before you ask. But serious illness =   MORPHINE  . You go into hospital, they fill you full of that stuff, then at some point after that, you leave. Simple, effective and a bit scary. To be honest I could be in Fiji or orbiting Venus after a great big warm shot of that. So whats happening in the real world just kind of sits in the background of my mind till the thing that brought me there subsides,by which time I'm well enough to be thinking about exit strategies (more later about that).  so, in conclusion-colds bad, morphine good. Or something  :: thinks the puppies are probably safe now ::
