This is not much really to blog about this morning. The Malcolm in the Middle season finale was on last night. It was great! Like   JR   said, the Fuhrer (leader) of Nazis Germany was on last night. That man was intruiging. Such a merciless creature, but a complex  and hard to understand person. (Actually, he is easy to understand, he was just a merciless, 'you'll never want to forgive" kind of person.......)  Well! It is school time children! So listen up at school, do your best and do what you have to do to get through the day! This is   Nick  signing off the morning shift, I'll see you in the afternoon!
