But, Sherdog.com is my favorite website of the moment.  If you are a fan of Mixed Martial Arts, or fighting in general, you need to check out this website.  The site has tons of information, interviews, pictures, video, etc.  Their forums are also top notch.  Several pro fighters post on there.  The most active ones being Bas Rutten, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Enson Inoue, Dexter Casey, and Lee Murray.  You can't beat that with a stick.
