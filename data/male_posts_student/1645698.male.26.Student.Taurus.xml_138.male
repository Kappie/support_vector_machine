Metallica - Fade to Black  Life it seems will fade away  Drifting further everyday  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me  Deadly loss this cant be real  Cannot stand this hell i feel  Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me but now, hes gone   No one but me can save myself, but its too late  Now i cant think, think why i should even try   Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye  Goodbye    Download it if you don't have it already, kick ass song, seriously.  I'm Deadinside, and those lyrics are amazingly accurate.  "So...T'm adopted. And I'm glad my parents told me too. Seriously, I am glad they told me, but uh...why everyday? The first time they told me, it was kinda weird, because it was the first time I ever recieved a...singing telegram....in gym class. Actually it was kind of a weird day for a lot of people in my familiy, because that's also the day they chose to tell my brother he was gay...and uh...that's-that's rough on a five year-old. Yeah...but it's great sometimes, because at those family reunions...you sit there...and you see...generations...of anger...and bitterness...and you might think to yourself...'How could I be related to these people?' And when that happens to me I think...'Oh WAIT...I'm NOT related to these people! Ha ha ha..these Jews are HILARIOUS...and uh..my you're looking good today "cousin" Mindy!'"
