Tyke wrote a funny answer to the explanation part of a problem and the teacher said she was laughing while she read it.  That is a good thing.  Anyway, after that they just shat around for an hour.  After that Tyke went to 2nd period and had a sub in there.  So that meant that he didn't have to work out.  And it was perfect cuz it was power clean day.  Tyke actually worked out his legs a bit, enough to make them tired after school in fact.  3rd period Tyke had a test about Congress and the budget.  Stupid test as there were a few questions that were almost repeated verbatim.  After the test they just shat around for a few minutes and then class was over.  4th period was also easy.  They talked about a stupid little paragraph in a stupid book for about 30 minutes.  Purdy tried to get the teacher to just move onto the quiz but BOOM she got shot down.  The teach just started screeching out how it is important to be learning the stuff and not taking quizzes or something along those lines.  They took the quiz and Tyke of course made some nice and funny answers as usual.  Similar to math.  Then they listened to one more song. Purdy's song.  Even though Tyke brought it in.  But Hands Down is just a plain great song.  Ok, off to lunch went the crew.  Tyke raced Doc P to Tyke's car and owned him.  No chance of outrunning Tyke.  If you are Doc P that is.  Some people are faster than him.  The gang went down to Pie and it was a pleasurable eat.  Mmmm.  As usual, when Macaroon went out to the bathroom the guys got up and ran to Tyke's car.  They were going to go around and actually pick up Macaroon right outside the door he comes out of but he got out too soon so it ended up looking like Tyke was just trying to drive away.  No hard feelings.  There isn't any animosity between people if it seems like there is.  It is just harmless kidding among guys.  Good times.  5th period was easy.  It was funny cuz Tyke and Macaroon made Tyke's logo for the school.  It is so hideous.  Eagle head, salmon torso, Indian legs.  Funny but hilariously hideous.  An odd match.  As is Tyke.  6th period trudged along though.  Just a simple lab between friends and it made it really easy.  Tyke hasn't finished it yet but he'll do that with Purdy in english tomorrow.  Or maybe Gov.  One of the two.  Tyke just putzed around and made jokes for the rest of the period and had a grand ol time.  After that they got out of school early for a pep assembly.  Not that anybody really went but it was just getting out of school 10 minutes early.  This is where the real interesting part started.  At least to Tyke.  Tyke and Purdy were talking about how she might not go to the boys bball game because of some reasons.  Well, Tyke tackled those reasons head on.  Here's how it came out.  Tyke and Purdy both drove to BCC (site of game at night) and parked Purdy's car as close to the gym as they could.  Then Tyke picked her up there and took her to her work which is semi-near the school.  So they sat around in the car waiting for her work to start and played some cards.  She somehow managed to win everytime but twice in Hold Em.  Stupid luck.  Well she went to work and then Tyke went over to Macaroon's house.  The two just shot around in the blazing heat and played some nice bball.  Really fun to play in a summer-esque environment.  And that is what it felt like.  Well after playing for a little while Tyke went on home.  He got home, ate some food, rested up, got the trash, did some laundry, and pretty much everything but homework cuz that isn't fun.  At 6 though he left and went to Purdy's work again as he was picking her up and then taking her to the game where her car already was.  It was a great plan made up by Tyke.  No flaws at all.  And it was fun.  So they got to the game and Tyke talked with Doc P, Macaroon, and Kinker.  Looks like Doc P won with the closest bet of the score.  Tyke was kinda close but the end screwed him.  The dunk off the pass off the glass was pretty sick.  Kinda like "the play."  Well after the game Tyke and Purdy went to her car and then she drove him to his car where he gave her back her stuff and they split.  Tyke came home and talked with his parents for a little and found out he has the house to himself for much of tomorrow.  And they gave him some money.  If only he had something to do tomorrow.  A lot of people are busy.  Or gone.  Or both.  Kinda sad.  He'll find something to do.  Surely he won't go bored.  Ok, not much to say.  It was a pretty good day.  Tyke is always wanting more, but who isn't?  Sometime though.  Sometime...  Well here is an edit to the blog.  It is totally unexpected Tyke would think and very much not like Tyke.  Tonight, for some reason or another, Tyke felt like doing a couple shots of something or drinking something.  Yeah, that is not like Tyke.  He still is the same morally but he just felt like getting drunk in a way.  He didn't, nor has he ever.  He hasn't really had much of anything to drink ever.  But tonight was a different mindset.  Ok, thats all.  Think about that one.  Ok, part deux now.  Or part tres really.  Tyke.  The mind of Tyke.  It is really tough with this over-exhaustive mind Tyke has.  He can't control it.  It never stops thinking about stuff.  And it is just topics like girls and...no, mainly girls.  It is a curse he has.  Oh, and this is serious talk.  So he isn't ever trying to be funny.  But really, this is all just about his troubles.  He can never stop thinking about girls and how much he wants what he can't have.  That has been his biggest problem in life.  Reaching for the unattainable.  And don't say there aren't unattainable girls.  Cuz that is a lie.  Tyke's experiences are proof enough for him.  And it seems to Tyke that girls must have a type that they like.  It may seem like there isn't but people do change so it must be that people's types change.  Although that would kind of defeat the purpose of having a type.  Whatever, it's stupid.  Tyke is just...fuck this...Purdy wanted Tyke to write this but she is offline now so he might as well just quit.  It isn't helping him.  This is all so stupid.  So so stupid.
