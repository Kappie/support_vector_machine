Tonight I went to the Carroll's house to play some games (on the condition that I bring some fudge of course). We first played Boggle, at which I admit I sucked pretty badly. I got better as the game went on.  We then played Mastermind, a game where two teams (in this case, consisting of Graham and me versus Linda and Nolan (Graham's mom and brother)) compete to reach the end of a pattern of squares by answering logic questions.  Thus, I have a question for y'all. I got this right and want to see who can get it right, first. Leave it as a comment.   Dave and Brad, two popular politicians, met at a club to discuss the overthrow of their party leader. They each ordered a vodka on the rocks. Brad downed his and ordered another. He then drank his second in a gulp and decided to wait before he ordered a third. Meanwhile, Dave, who was sipping his drink, suddenly fell forward dead. Both men were setup for an assassination. Why did Dave die and Brad live?    Have fun!   Pay no attention to what the critics say... Remember, a statue has never been set up in honor of a critic!  (Jean Sibelius)
