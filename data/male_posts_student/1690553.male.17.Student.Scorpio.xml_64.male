Anyway, here the pictures. I'll be in Johore tomorrow and hopefully I can blog from there.     Uncle Azman  Muhammad      My Father  my Sisters      Auntie Siti  Uncle Hanafi   By the way, Uncle Azman had bought an O2 XDA II to replace his stolen original XDA. I managed to get this two pix and tested it's Bluetooth function. I succesfully paired with his wife's P800 and transfered a 2MB+ MP3 file without much problem. It's camera is good and the screen is very bright. But then, it doesn't include WiFi as what it advertised and only availabe as an SDIO expansion card?
