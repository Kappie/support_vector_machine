How I envy the new Year Ones, they have got the latest computer and in their labs. Why oh why didn’t we get an upgrade last year? Why do we have to suffer waiting for excess to faster computers? Anyway, I’m glad that my final project last year is now being showcase. We went looking for our pass tutors, and they were having fun with the new year ones. Hey, they were playing games. I don’t recall my batch playing games with the tutors during the beginning of the year. Instead, we were greeted with a project right away. The year ones this year surely are enjoying a lot of stuff all thanks to our feedback last year.   Alright, back in the E studio (com lab ‘class room’ from now onwards), we gathered in our groups discussing on what we had done on the Punggol site analysis. We’re so lost that we would need a torchlight as bight as the sun to guide us through. Oh no, after asking the tutor I think I’m further at lost now then ever. Not knowing what to do, I headed into web surfing to gather more info. In that way, even if I have no idea what to do, at least I’ll have some materials to discus with the rest of my group even though I’m not doing my work. I don’t want to dwell on the technology part of this report, it’s the most straight forward part yet there’s so little data to be collected.   Got home early today, so I took an afternoon nap. Now I’m up and doing more research on the net, and I’m still feeling sleepy. I can’t wait for the weekends to come. Oh yah, I can’t stand this beetle that has been flying around in this room. The beetle keeps on clinging on to my hair even after I brushed it off.
