Today at HYPE meeting I'd find out that Kendrick....one of my HYPE counselors apparently went to the same church as Jenn, Peggy, and others. Lol kinda funny to imagine that he's now my HYPE counselor. Today was a REALLY long day. Beginning at 8am with badminton and not ending until later after a game of SC probably lol. And blasted daylight savings time....ugh got one hour less sleep 2nite >_  Like I said before today my day started at 8am. UCC badminton.....yup once again I'm headed to the UCC for more badminton. So I woke up, quickly ate, and ran out the door. Though I was supposed to meet Thompson there today at 8.....I kinda was 20 minutes late lol. This time though he was on time......so he had to wait for me. Well my Uncle *who's name is John also* was already there when me and Thompson went up there. Lina and Yang were there today also. Played some mixed doubles game.....and then a guys doubles game where it was me and Thompson vs. my uncle and some other dude. We lost 15-8 *crappage* lol. It was pretty cool though....I've actually got a bit better now =P. Fit in around 6-7 games.....and then left for home....still had to do piano.  Piano practice....ate.....more piano.....then left for piano lessons. Wow.....fun eh?=P not.   Piano lessons......got nagged at for being behind theory....but my pieces for Kiwanis are still soundin' good.......JUST GOTTA KEEP THIS SOUND GOING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS...........AND DO MY THEORY lol. So yeah piano lessons weren't that bad. Didn't get yelled at =P.  And no time to lose.....after piano lessons went to hand in my Kidney Foundation canvass stuff.....but the place was CLOSED today. Ugh.....stupid form...so now I gotta go again on Monday when it's OPEN. Grr......waste of time going across London for nothing. Bah.  So came back home....ate.......played SC.....and then got ready to go to Wendy's for HYPE tonight. SC was amusing...I guess. I've started getting back into it again. I need a better comp....I want to play Battlefield Vietnam....gah stupid P3 800mhz......I need a "l33t" comp. Oh yes the word "l33t," bit overused by Megatokyo.......but what kinda manga would it be w/out the nerdiness? That's one reason why I like it. "PH33R MY L4CK OF B33R!"  So off to Wendy's house for HYPE meeting. Well pre-meeting to plan out rest of April. Before that though...played some PS2 w/ Kendrick and Josh. SOUL CALIBUR II= HILARIOUS GAME LOL. Wow.....playing 8 on 8 is so cool. It's like Street Fighter........but with more  bling bling and cooler moves lol. It's actually pretty cool game....lol cheap like any other fighting game but it's really amusing. Oh yeah and Wendy seems to complain about a 51" widescreen TV being to small. What's wrong with her?! lol j/k Wenders =P.  Never really realized until today how many people are graduating from University this year. Mike, Connie, Ali.......*sigh* so many people that I first met in english service when I first started coming. Also Connie will always be remembered being one of the pioneer counselors of HYPE.....her, Jesse, Amanda, and Janice were like the pioneers of HYPE lol. Mike....well he was always announcements guy lol and Ali well she's our present HYPE counselor......plus she's been around w/ our church for a while now....as the others. Gonna be so weird next year not seein' em in service....as they are back in Toronto. Well there's always visiting =P. But yeah just planning stuff today.....end of UWo school year is so close........yet High schoolers still gotta suffer for two months *shakes fist.* Basically this is what's comin' up:  April 10th: Easter study April 17th: Praise night April 24th: Farewells and year end party ^_^  Those are the last 3 meetings Ali and JT will be in unfortunately though.....but they do have their other callings from Christ still too. But it's for the best that they do leave since it is God's will. Hope they remember us and HYPE =P. After the planning and discussions *oh yeah I gotta type up email for HYPE about this,* had an IMMENSE dinner courtesy of Wendy's family and then HYPE meeting w/ the rest of HYPE.  HYPE meeting..the actual one. Today's lesson: Corporate vs. Consumer churches. Basically we were learning about how we could serve in our church *kinda like Spiritual Gifts workshop* but we got more in-depth with a church's image also, and how a church shouldn't be judged on looks but on the people inside. I liked today's lesson...and it got everybody involved which was cool. Oh man.......but Steph tonight was just lashin' out the burns lol.  Gavin: Yeah....my brother's been a bit mean to me lately. Like we haven't really been talking. Maybe it's because.... I'm a bit of a..... Steph: Jerk?? Gavin: OOw.......................  Then the rest of HYPE starts to laugh too lol.....then there's me  Joe: Yeah I've been thinkin' lately that counseling seems pretty cool.....I mean the idea of helping people w/ their problems and sharing your feelings with them... Steph: Joe remember counseling requires listening.  And since I'm a talkative one........yes the rest of HYPE once again chimes in with OOOOOOH'S and LOL's. Gavin shot back in the end though......saying something around the lines of "Yeah Steph is doin' all this 'cause u know.....it's all gonna wash away all squeaky clean when she baptizes." Yeah I bet half of you don't get it....but it was basically makin' fun of her baptism. Not very smart but it's all jokes haha. Steph then made more remarks....but I think I've said enough lol. Hilarious night though. Yeah......but honestly I've come to start to really get more involved with my church lately. Pretty cool though....I mean doin' Worship at times, Ushering, etc. On the side I also like to "counsel" people w/ their problems......great feeling when you see another bro or sister of Christ or even just a random person walk away with their problem solved. Kinda makes me consider Psychology a career route =).  After some prayers, sharing, and of course FOOOOOOD! Had some of that.....took a cookie and pop and then had to go home.  SO yeah that's the shortened version of my day......HYPE meeting of course also had teaching.....and oh yes JT's friend came too.....forgot his name though =S. But fun night tonight. Hmm.....things to do now. Set my stupid clock back for daylight savings time....and then sleep. Stupid clocks.......why the heck does Canadian gov't make us do this? Waste of time...and sleep. Argh. So yeah I'm headed to bed now......only got 5 hours of sleep left technically. Lates.
