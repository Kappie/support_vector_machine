I feel empathy to Egyptian mummies who had a spoon shoved up their noses and swirled around until the brains become mush. That's the AP Chem test. End of the Year Projects are appearing. And damn it, but I need to do them well to hold to my grades. *Sigh* I almost envy the nonchalant grader. Then I remember I'll be getting merit scholarships and I just do the damn work.
