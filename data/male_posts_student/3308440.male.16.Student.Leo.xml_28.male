Try and guess where I am working...  shop? ...bank? ...anything to do with something where I get paid or work long hours?   Nope.  I am working at school teaching younger kids electronics and helping them with the coursework I finished this year I aint getting paid but working about 6 hours a fortnight anit that bad now is it?  If you live in England did you notice the flags hanging out of the windows of peoples houses and flying on peoples cars? and did you also notice when England lost the first game they all disappeared then England won the next two matches but they still disappeared in between? why not just leave them up? Ah well they are out now and all the hype is over for another two years...  Just to say I am not fully English I am a quarter Irish as well so sometimes there may be a change of perspective between they are out and we are out so it all depends what mood I am in at the time.  Just one more paragraph that is football related I promise... I want to ask anyone who reads my blog and who is not from England do people in  your  country smash up  their own  pubs and shops just because their team lost a sports match?  Ah thatâ€™s about it now normal service will be resumed from now on.  See Ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Wierd Al Yankovic - Amish paradise
