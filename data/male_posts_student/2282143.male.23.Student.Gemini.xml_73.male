Perhaps because I wasnt of legal drinking age at that time.  But anyways, it was funny.  There were midgets and dwarves and overall little people. There was white trash and underage hotties trying to look cool (this one girl had some spastic dance moves... was pretty funny).  The bar itself was nothing spectacular and it kind of reminded me of CO's a bit with some tiki flair.  Overall, I kinda felt like I was in college again.  But the night was just crazy.  There ended up only being four of us, me, Wendy, Kevin, and Kara? Sarah?  I didnt really catch her name, just that it had an "ara" in it.  I dont do well in loud places with hearing.  Lots of smiling and nodding.  But the night was laid back.  Played some cricket, Wendy danced in the cages they have (by the way, who hires cage dancers?!?!  and how do you get that job?!?!), just drank and chatted.  Kinda felt a bit awkward because the safety net wasnt there (ie anyone I really knew).  I mean, I this is only the third time I have even met Wendy, but she is a cool girl and I guess if she is a friend of Lark's she is a friend of mine.  The other two people I didnt know, but they were very cool.  Kevin is a marine.  Hell, the whole reason for going out was because he is leaving for a nice one year stint in the sand.  Being a marine, he's pretty much a badass, and jokes about being more of a badass when he comes home and scoring chicks with his badassness.  He was also joking around about getting killed.  He was saying that some of these kids are right out of boot camp and how when he was right out of camp, he would have no clue how to fight and such.  And that "if they get me killed, Im gonna be so pissed at them..."  So now the war really has a human face for me.  I wish the guy the best.  Oh well.  Off to work!  its raining and its gonna be a slow one...
