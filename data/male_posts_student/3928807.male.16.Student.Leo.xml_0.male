So the whole gang came over to his house again. Right before I had to go (at a lame 12:00) we smoked some hash and weed. I got very mildly high. I was thinking of smoking tonight - i'm just deciding if its really worth doing it alone. I mean, what am I going to do after? Go on MSN? Go into a chat room? It doesnt sound that appealing. I guess I could go to Harrison's house or something. I'll have to think more about it.
