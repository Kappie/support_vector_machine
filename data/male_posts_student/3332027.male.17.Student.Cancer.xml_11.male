As cancer the crab, i am moody and i do change moods many times a day. read what this website said:    "Sex could turn a one-night stand into marriage. The only problem arises when Cancer becomes moody. When Cancer gets moody, Leo will withdraw and seem selfish. The more Cancer clings, the worse Leo becomes. Leo needs to understand that Cancer is more sensitive than they appear and Cancer needs to know that Leo is faithful but needs a boys/girls night out every once in a while. Leo will make Cancer feel loved like never before and Cancer provides Leo emotional security in love. This is a good choice for both signs. Sex and love are very possible. Strong compatibility and loyalty will survive any stormy moments."     After reading that, I don't know if this raises or lowers my hope of getting back together. I don't know why i dwell on this so much. Another site said that cancers are moody, stubborn, and dwell on the past. OMG, i do what i tell people not to do.  This tells you right here that I pushed him away. I'M a LoSeR!!!! WhY DiDn'T I sEe mY OwN FaULtS???
