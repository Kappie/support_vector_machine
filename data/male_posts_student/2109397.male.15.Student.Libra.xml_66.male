Me, ALEX, my sister, and my father are all making a trek to the Windy City to see my team Bayern Munich (hence the sn) play Manchester United who have an American playing keeper for them. And he better fucking play or else it will be someones head. Both teams are full of World-Class stars and it will undoubtely be an experience of a lifetime. So stoked I am.   We. have nosebleed seats though. I took way too long to look for tickets. So we suffered and we are very high up. But hey at least I can say I was there BITCH>
