This week besides today has been pretty typical but today I celebrated my independence day I played in the church orchestra today which is always fun because that's what I love is playing intruments I think that's my God given talent. I seem to always feel closer when I play for God instead me thinking hey look how good i am at playin this or look what i can do because its really not me its God through me and that's why I like playing in the orchestra if any of you are interested about what intruments I can play  I can play about 10 different intruments these are the intruments I have played before and  can play ill put it in order of which I leared fist to last. Piano, French Horn, Trumpet, Contra Bass Clarinet, Oboe, Mellophone(its a marching French horn), Bass Clarinet, Clarinet, Baitone, Bari Sax.Ok on wiht the rest of the post i also want to say thank you to all the Military that have fought for our freedom and died for our freedom. To me freedom is the best blessing of all that I have had well Besides getting saved because I probly would have never leared about God so freely as i could today because of freedom of religion and speech which gives us the right to proclaim our Christianity and share to other people. The Bible says live our lives to the fullest and with a free country like this we can go to different countries and share God to Muslims Buddhists Mormons and there's lots of other but there's just to many to post and I think that if we can have so much freedom why not use I mean what's the point of having the freedom if we just sit around thinkin o someone else can talk to them or its the pastors job to save the people I mean come on how lame is that if God has given you a burden for someone you should go and do your best that God has given you. So that's why I think the soldiers for our freedom and rights that we can go and proclaim that God is lord of all and that he created us for a specific reason no matter how insinificant you are well I guess I could just go on rambling on but I have to go pack some more soo ill post ya when I get back                       /////{[JJ]}\\\\\
