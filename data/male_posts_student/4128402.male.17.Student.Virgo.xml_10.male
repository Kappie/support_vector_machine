So i shall waffle on about an unrelated issue, my current dilemma: whether or not to go for an interview for a new job. I have been invited to an interview at some call centre hingymajig in airdre and the question is to go or not. Points for: i loathe my current employ, better money, easier work, i think i might as well go seeing as i already have an interview in keeping with my 'try everything, and if you dont die, you win' dictum, etc. Points against: its far away (airdre is 3 buses from my house), might not be viable when i go to uni as the hours are gammy, scary interview where i have to do 'role playing' (shudders), it involes an early rise on saturdays (shudders). So i am at a loss. I know not what to do. Should i go for a beast of an interview for a job which i really wont like or be good at as it involves telephones which im told i am not a master of as i dont talk, or should i stay in a job which i hate because its the most menial soul sucking crap in the world, ever. Decisions, decisions. I might hold out and see if i can get a job in a place i would like, such as HMV or a bookshop or Global Video or something which i know a lot about. I dont know. I also have to decide whether or not to get driving lessons for my 18th which im unsure about coz i cant afford a car once i pass or insurance, which thus renders driving lessons a pointless excercise. Ive now realised that i analyse things way too much and i should stop thinking and have more beer to dumb down my thoughts and make me think of less complicated matters such as bluebells and cockleshells and pretty maids all in a row. Bye now.
