I mean, technically, I'm sure I felt lonely because of connections others were having that I wish I had. At some level my increased loneliness was a longing for what others had and as such is just immaturity. It also means I would rather not be alone, but rather with these others. Still, the line is right in many ways. Sometimes it's better not to have that thrust into your face.  Detachment. Lisa says it's okay. I think true strength is to face the world and be strong despite the harsh truth. It's an imperfect world though. We can't have our ideals and to some extend we can hide from life until we die or get over the problem.  I am speaking too vaguely. As always. So Elissa, Kelly, Jamay, Kenny, April, and I were hanging at April's new place. They played truth or dare, swam around. My mood wasn't from what was going on so much as just the crap that happened all day (Kelly left abruptly last night and I thought I might have upset her, then I wake up to a sore neck, with not enough sleep, to find out my car window is broken, stereo stolen, and iPod lost all it's music). So yeah, a bad mood combined with hanging out with people doing stuff I'm not so much into anyway. Elissa told me today we just couldn't have mutual "best friends".  She does NOT like me at all, and as such friends can't be around both of us enough to be best friends?  Anyway, seems to me it's up to the other person how they feel about us both.  Kelly and Elissa can be best friends without it changing the fact that I still care for and respect Kelly just as much.  It would merely mean Kelly spends more time with Elissa and I should be happy for her.  Like if she had a date that went well and was falling in love.   A little easier with a date than my ex, but same idea.  This is way too sad. I am so upbeat normally. I am more aware of freedom that people have, and as such feel more confident. I'm called arrogant for it, but I feel that all peopole have such power over their lives. It's not a "me" thing. Since I feel more powerful than most, they think I feel more powerful than them. I guess. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe everyone else is right. Often they are.  I need new people in my life. I have so much positive emotion and love and everything in me, and it's killing me having nothing to do with it. It's not a good place to need others though. I need to come back to reality and be complete in and of myself. I've already put too much energy into Kelly out of my loneliness and I can see it bugging her sometimes. So much of our moods and ideas about things relates to little things we do. The constant flirting between everyone around me lately bugs the shit out of me. I've been a slight part of it too and that also bugs me. When I detach from it, I simply feel lonely. The group mentality and pressure is a bad influence. It's one of the many reasons I relate better to people one on one. Or maybe I'm just bad in groups. Sounds like I'm insecure.  I don't think I'm insecure. I think I want so badly to have friends I imagine I am close to people sometimes. I imagine things that aren't. Sometimes for me love is that feeling where you know you and another person put each other above the rest of the world. Maybe you can only love one person at a time and it's a ton more than what you feel for anyone else. I had it once. I never trusted/knew Elissa well enough to have quite that. There was always that doubt in the back of my mind that kept me from feeling truely secure and in love. I mean, there are moments where you feel all that, but the long term wasn't just that perfect trust and happiness.  I feel miserable. I need something to fix it. Understanding would be nice. Mostly I'm just telling myself it's because I'm lonely and that doesn't help. I can't go make friends right away. I can only understand that I'm where I need to be and have hope for the future. But I'm miserable, aka I don't understand and have that hope. I see that I don't really have people that notice or fill my voids and that I am not big on meeting new people. It's a goal, but not one I feel confident enough in to grasp hope and happiness yet. The patience game is best played with anticipation, not dread.
