Friday:  Right after school, we had to finish filming our Theater Arts movie over at Highlander Stadium. There was a slight miscommunication between the athletic director and myself, so I almost had to sign a 1 million dollar liability waiver. Good thing Mr. Martin and Ms. Boyer help me take care of that issue. While I'm not going to name anyone specifically, there's one person that in my group that I honestly hope I never have to see again after this school year. Enough on that.  We also had our 2nd playoff game against Hillcrest on Friday. J.T. had a little bit of fun with me right before the game started, so I took a picture when I got home, and I'll put it up here. We won something like 12 or 13 to 1, so we play against someone else this next week. Not sure who, where, or if I'll even do it since it will be in the middle of exams.  Edit: Here's the picture of what J.T. did to me at the baseball game on Friday. I got quite a few comments about it...       Saturday:  Started working on my U.S. History exam review (since I'm not in AP). Mid-morning I left to go help someone get their DSL hooked up, but I couldn't do any more than just get all the hardware set up since DSL won't be activated until the 19th. Guess I know where I'll be going after exams one day...  I was gone the majority of the afternoon because I went to go see Van Helsing with my grandmother. I thought it was a pretty good movie; I liked it about as much as I did the first X-Men. Here's the list of the other movies that we're going to see this summer:     -Troy    -Shrek 2    -The Day after Tomorrow    -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    -The Chronicles of Riddick    -I, Robot    -The Bourne Supremacy    -King Arthur    -The Village  Nothing big happened last night, I just played a little FFXI and created this blog. Then went to sleep as my away message normally says.    Sunday:  Hmmmm....To-Do list for today:     -Finish U.S. History Exam Review    -Change script for Theater Arts movie    -Finish reading  Grapes of Wrath     -Upload picture from baseball and add it to this post    -Get movie clip to Andrew  And, yeah...that's about it. I need to read the Blogger help file this afternoon for uploading/linking pictures. Pretty sure it's the same as normal HTML (the rest of this markup is), but I just want to make sure.
