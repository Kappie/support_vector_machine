But I tried.]  Alarm clock did not ring The time I slept right past I thought I would do all the reading be- -fore class but I'm not that fast Though I am on panel - what's the chance she'll call on me? Cause I got a friendly smile And I'm as clueless as I can be  And I'm walking in class late  Tripping on a backpack, coat, and chair  Walking in class late  But do I really know why I am there?  Saw the ghost of Posner In the comment someone made Then as she called on the person next to me Real silently, I prayed Now perhaps she will not see me If I slump down in my seat If she calls my name I'll hang my head in shame And go down to defeat  Cause I was walking in class late  Didn't do the reading yesterday Walking in class late  I do not have a clever thing to say  She's got three prongs on the blackboard And she's looking right at me I turn the page; the page is useless There is nothing there to see I wish I'd stayed in bed more  Now teacher she points my direction And she says something about a case It's a case I've never heard of And she sees it on my face I mouth the words "please save me" And her eyes move one row back She says "Tell me 'bout this decision" And my world just fades to black  I won't be walking in class late  I'll take my one free pass and go from there Walking in class late  Someone up above answered my prayer  Walking in class late  The moral of the story is as goes Walking in class late No one who's on panel ever shows.
