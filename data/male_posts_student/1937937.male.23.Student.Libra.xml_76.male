Technically, I don't know what I'm going to do when I get there, but the way I see it, things like that take care of themselves.  Of course, I'm going to be there during the Olympics.  I plan to attend Chariot Racing, Pankration, and the Pentathlon.  Go USA!  I'll be the guy wearing the red, white, and blue.  I'll have an enormous bumper sticker on my ass that says: "Bush / Cheyney '04 and Forever!".  No, seriously, this'll be good.  It'll give me a chance to experience the international flavour.  I haven't been out of North America and it's Islands since 9/11.  I've heard a lot about how much everyone would like to shove it to us, but I've yet to experience it first hand, and that's what life is all about.  Maybe I'll take a notebook, and pretend to be a journalist.  That way, if I get kidnapped, I can tell them I'm a reporter, and they'll spare me.  As it stands, I've got no chance: I'm no Canadian diplomat!  Anyway, I'm doing some laundry right now, trying to figure out if I have enough clothes to last me through the trip, etc.  Pre-trip stuff.  Always exciting.
