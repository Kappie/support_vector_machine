But in the past two years cats have begun to grow on me, and with my current living situation I can only get a cat.  I'm not home enough as sometimes I work almost 12 hour days, and I feel mean keeping a dog in an apartment all day.    On my Mom's farm, there is this long haired male cat that showed up out of the blue about a year ago.  Since then he has managed to knock up every barn cat, some at least three times since his arrival.  The only cat I'm aware of that he hasn't made preggers is Roof Cat, the cat that sits on the barn roof all day (hence the name), but she is non to friendly to begin with.  Now that I think of it, I don't even know if Roof Cat is male or female, no one has ever gotten that close to it.  Any way, long haired male was at it again, recently two of the female cats produced litters.    Bobo, the bobtailed cat had three.  All three look the same, grey with dark stripes and white paws.  Except that one has a tail and the other two take after their mother with only a stub.  For some reason whenever long haired male mates with Bobo, his long hair trait becomes recessive.  These kittens, as all other kittens from this pair before them, are short haired.  My sister's cat Hokie (it's a Virginia Tech thing) is from Bobo and long haired male, she is short haired with a normal tail. These kittens are about two weeks old, and currently reside in the empty calf hutch used to store straw.  Bobo, not the prettiest cat by far, is friendly enough to let anyone come in and pet them or pick them up.  She is cool like that.  Another litter was produced by Bobo's sister (my oldest sister, who apparently knows the barn cat genealogy better than anyone else, told me of this relation).  She had two kittens, and they are the best litter she has ever had, from what I hear.  Bobo's sister likes to hide her kittens until they are much older.  There are a lot of foxes and other predators around, and a mother must be careful.    Unlike Bobo, Bobo's sister always has long haired cats.  My Mom's cat, Indie is from this pair and he is long haired, as well as Fuzzy Cat, another barn cat.  My youngest sister's cat, Mascot, I believe is from this pair (she is fuzzy) but I'll have to check with my oldest sister as I'm not too sure.  The best thing about these long haired cats is that with their soft hair, they don't shed much at all.  You can barely even tell my Mom even has a cat.  I was looking at the bob tail kittens, but I think I'm going to go with the long haired.  My sister said that in another week Bobo's sister will probably bring them from across the street to start feeding with the other cats (my sister gives them milk in the mornings) and she will snatch one for me.
