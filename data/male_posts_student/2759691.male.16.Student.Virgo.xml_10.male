A recently released report says that sales were down from $13,000 to under $2,000 in California alone. "Gas prices are causing consumers to seek more efficient and cheaper alternatives," said Dr. Hall Burten, the president of GasBrush Technologies. The report advises toothbrush companies to seek alternatites such as hydrogen-powered fuel cells and experimental "hybrid" technology. Some companies are already developing such technologies and hope the new products will be availible early next year.  Meanwhile, consumers are not holding back their complaints with the toothbrush companies. "My brush doesn't get good mileage at all," said one customer, "and I am considering getting one of those electric ones."
