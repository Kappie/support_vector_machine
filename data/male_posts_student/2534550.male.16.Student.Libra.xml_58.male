Item 3: little time to do it  Item 4: play thurs, fri, sat Item 5: band concert thurs Item 6: Sectional fri  And the sad thing is that all of this doesnt even make up a fourth of my schedule this week, i seriously need like 1 week to do nothing, and i wont be able to have one of those until well until the choir trip which isnt to myself persay o well...  On the plus side, my hard work has paid off because for the first time since well freshmen year first semester, i made honor roll, i also got recommended for a leadership conference out of about 200 people which was exciting, its nice to know that i am being appreciated in some way.   Well the trial is really close and considering what happend today with the other trial im not tooo worried. But still nervous non the less. I never really noticed how much thought goes into the judicial systems, and i also now have a great respect for lawyers because every time they talk they risk being humiliated. I dont know its just really crazy.   Well kids i think ill go study or something i also must go to class in 30 min bye
