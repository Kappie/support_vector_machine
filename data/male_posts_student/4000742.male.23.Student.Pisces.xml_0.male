I haven't myself applied for getting into this committee. But one of my classmates has, and after a round of interviews, he has been given a task to be completed in 2 weeks. The task is 'Improving the IT infrastructure of IIML'. Since he doesn't have a technical background (he worked for 3 years for the HR firm Hewitt Associates), he approached me to assist him. I readily agreed, and so we have just begun some preliminary spadework, along with two other batchmates. Over the last two days, we have:   Studied the network infrastructure of the whole campus. There is a chart showing this, very helpfully put up in the library  Talked to the Synapse team, which manages some of the software aspects, the IIML website, the intranet portals, etc. and collected inputs about what enhancements they wish to have  Collected some data about the patterns of usage of the network facilities - both the Internet and the Fast Ethernet LAN    Over the next few days, we will have to think about:   Passing a questionnaire around to both first and second-years, to gauge the general views on what improvements they want  Interacting with some faculty members to find out if they can suggest something from their side so as to utilize the LAN for academic or useful purposes  Doing homework about the costs and installation times of wireless LAN in the academic block, increasing the external bandwidth from 2Mbps to 4Mbps, making optimum use of the Computer Centre, etc.
