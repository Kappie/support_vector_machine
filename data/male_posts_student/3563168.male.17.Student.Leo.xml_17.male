It was nuts, eventually it left though.  Normally I would be glad to wake up at any time before noon, however the night before I was up till about 6 in the morning due to nasty ass acid reflux. It was probably due to the chili and pizza I had for dinner, but man it sure did suck ass.  When I woke up my mouth felt like an exhaust pipe. It should probably prompt me to eat better, but I'm a teenager so screw it. I'll deal, and probably drink more water since that kind of helps.  For some reason, this makes me think of people complaining. Actually, it does because I'm complaining about my heartburn. Either way, it drives me nuts when people say that their life sucks. I mean really, it could be a lot worse, just because you don't have a date or you have to go school doesn't mean your life sucks, it just means that you have a couple of problems that suck.  Next time I hear somebody say that their life sucks, I'm gonna kick them in the balls. Either that or I'll just stop talking to them. I'll probably flip a coin on it.
