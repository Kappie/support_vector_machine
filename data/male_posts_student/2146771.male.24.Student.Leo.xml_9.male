It's hard to find people to hang out with once you're married.  Especially decent people.  I'll have to say My favorite is still the Curtis family.  But it's kinda cheating to pick them, they're family and they have a cute little boy. Hee hee.    My battery went dead on my video camera tonight at church.  I always forget it doesn't charge when it's on and plugged in.  Oh well, now I've learned.  Now it's back to my website.  I just got done checking out our churches music pastor's website.  www.trentsmithmusic.com  Check it out, I'm going to have to remember to buy his CD.
