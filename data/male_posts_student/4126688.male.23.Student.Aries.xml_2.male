On any given day, you can find the radio dial in my truck set to listen to  urlLink WUNC , my source for  urlLink NPR ,  urlLink Car Talk ,  urlLink Prairie Home Companion , and  urlLink Back Porch Music . This day was different. Having become bored with the news that Republicans and Democrats cannot get along, I switched the station to the Triangle’s " urlLink Hit Music Channel ." I found that the cure to boredom is inspiration.  The song that rocked me back to my teenage days was “Meant to Live” by  urlLink Switchfoot . The next day a friend gave me a copy of their CD, “ urlLink The Beautiful Letdown ,” and I have been inspired ever since. (My daughter has even enjoyed some head-bangin’ to these tunes and, like her dad, she likes it loud!)  Beyond their stimulating rock and roll music, their lyrics are deep and insightful giving (at least me) a glimpse of a postmodern perspective.   We want more than this world’s got to offer. We want more than the wars of our fathers.   Critics of the first postmodern generation, Gen X, label us as the “me” generation. By this they mean that we are self-centered and only interested in getting more and more and more for ourselves. And one might see that message in these lines. I do not. The desire for “more” is qualitative, not quantitative. We want a deeper life. We want life that has more meaning. We want something better for the world than buildings that crumble, companies that are unjust, and institutions that corrupt. What’s “more?” One answer could be community. Community that is strong, just, and incorruptible.  What’s “more?” You tell me.
