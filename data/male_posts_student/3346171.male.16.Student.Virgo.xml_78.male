I was doing nothing all long day of vacation, and on sunday morning i took some clothes and went. Afternoon we went to the Mall, and   they bought lot's of stuff ,  I didn't - what's the news?????!!!!! -. My   dad   had   gave   me some   money  -      miracle!!!!!! - and the night before i found 10 reais :), but i didn't want to spend it, I'll put it on my  savings  tomorrow.      urlLink http://www.brfoto.net/a_luiz/a_luiz-20040613-1.jpg  ( cousins )        Remember that math test i  was  going to redo?!
