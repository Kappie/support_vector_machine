Anyway, I bought --well, my mom bought Chronic Future's new EP out called "Lines In My Face". And it rocks! It's different and it's really good stuff.   You can click on the picture below to launch the band's player. There you can watch their new music video for "Time and Time Again" and listen to some other songs on their CD. I like it a lot.    urlLink     urlLink  Chronic Future's Official Site    Check it out, you'll see their style is totally different, which is pretty awesome. Chronic Future - Lines In My Face... good listens...  Still enjoying my summer. There's a worship team meeting tonight at 8:00... that's all I'm doing tonight. I might have a movie night afterwards for anyone who wants to come. Hey, you're invited too!    "there's some utterly damaged particles to deal with and if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift when stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed you dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist and there's no way to get back experiences you missed so start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss.  time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are but you can't keep running away from what your trying to find."
