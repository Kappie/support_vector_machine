The school initially had it organized so that kids would individually have to head down to an office and fill out ballots.  I just knew that very few kids would see the incentive in doing that so I told the people in charge that I thought that was a bad idea.  Then they told me to come up with a better idea.  Voila, one week later, I've typed up the ballots for each grade's elections, recruited 14 election monitors, scheduled the voting times, and made over 1000 copies of ballots.  It wasn't as tough as it may sound here, and it is going to be well worth it.  Now we will get everyone in the school to vote.   In other news on Saturday, I was in the city with Dan and we found an amazing smoothie joint.  They make good veggie wraps too.  I'm gonna frequent that locale much more often.   School is out in exactly two weeks and I can almost taste the summer.  Finals are gonna start up next week and mostly just math, and music are pissing me off.  Math is pissing me off because I'm forced to review some stuff and it really blows reviewing math work.  Not to mention that she's littering the days leading up to the two day final with chapter tests on old chapters.  I have to perform exceptionally on every test to restore my math grade back to where I used to have it.  That shouldn't be hard in general except for perhaps the final which might be a little hard, who knows.  I'm making it seem like a bigger deal than it actually is though.  Music isn't actually a problem except for the fact that the class is going to be forced to cheat rampantly all over again because he insists on giving us midterms and finals based on course material that we never covered.  Well that's shitty you-don't-have-a-say-in-this-shit public school for you.  I'm gonna ace it, but it's gonna be by cheating and that makes me feel bad.   I should have a new wallpaper done by Monday at the latest.  This is going to join, "where are my pixels" in the colorblind design line of work--so expect it to be colorful and random as a motherfucker.   I need to read more Hemingway, and faster, because Dan and I are probably going to begin The Sun Also Rises this weekend.  I also want to write some more in my black book.  As soon as school finishes up, I'm gonna start up work on my short story with a vengeance.... 2 da max!   That's all for now.
