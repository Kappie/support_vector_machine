After reading about a hundred of the thousand page collection of memories and annecdotesm I have come to the conclusion that It is, without a doubt, one of the funniest works of non-fiction I have ever read. It conveyes a sense of connectability and humanity that one does not typically apply to Presidents. The stories, ranging from Clinton's experiances with a wayward ram during a summer as a child to how he has learned to cope with the alcoholism of his Step-father, paint a deep and elegant portrait of a man full of love and understanding yet berift with pains and anguish. This is going to sound deeply partisan, and I dont care mind you, but there are days where I wish there was no restriction on the ammount of terms a President can serve in office. If you want a good reason to join my minority view point, that Bill Clinton is a man to be respected and admired, read this book. If you dont want a reason, read it anyway. Its fucking hilarious.
