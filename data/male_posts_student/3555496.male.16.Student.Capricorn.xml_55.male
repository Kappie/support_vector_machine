Fall Semester :  1A - English 3 Dual Credit 1B - Physics (Honors) 2A - Pre-Cal (Honors) 2B - US History (Honors) 3 - BCIS 4 - Wind Ensemble   My schedule isn't bad, it's just that I've been forced into BCIS. That class is so stupid. Not to mention slow. Basically the teacher glorifies MS Office and tries to make it seem like a fun suite of applications, but everyone knows Word is as lame as  urlLink this  dog. I mean, I'm like a few steps ahead of everybody in the room, including the Teach.  Lunch was also pretty bad, thanks largely in part to the stupid sophmores. Actually they're  still  just stupid fish, only they're in the 10th grade. Bastards. They were holding up the damn lunch line because they didn't know their PIN numbers. "Oh, miss, I don't know my pin number," was said about a thousand times before I made it to the ca$h register. Pygmies!  I saw my favorite colorguard had B lunch and I hung out with her and her friends. I'm talkin' about  urlLink SCHWING !  More as it develops.
