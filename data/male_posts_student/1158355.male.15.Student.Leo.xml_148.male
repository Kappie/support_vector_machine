Goo's Blogger 1st Anniversary! Wow, this year went slow now that I think of it. In the past couple of days I hung out with Jay, Matt, Heaton and Paul. At least that's all the people I remember hanging out with. Friday after school I hung out with Paul and then Heaton came over. Then Heaton and I went into town without Paul because he was too lazy. In town, Heaton and I got some pizza, went to Cornet (Heaton bought guitar strings) and Heaton lost his phone on the bike ride there so we had to find it, it was at Smithtown Elem. At Matt's house, Jay and I took Matt's been bags and rode them down his stairs. We also jumped from the upstairs balcony across the stairs and onto the otherside...that was fun but scary. Then I slept at Heaton's that night, we were at the movies with Matt and Jay but then decided Heaton and I didn't want to see Scary Movie 3 again and there was nobody there worth talking to so we left. Yesterday Heaton, Matt and I jammed, it was fun, we made some song...Right. Last night Heaton was going to sleep over (a second night of sleep overness!) but he decided not to because of the much much work he had today. Instead we just hung out and watched Star Wars Episode II, BORING! I had to watch my sister that night because my parents were bowling... fortunetly the boys didn't have to come over, god their insane. So Paul came over and we watched Reloaded. He never saw it before and was dying to see it. I think Paul's organization skills and attention span are rising. Normally he'd forget he was coming over, but he didn't forget. He even set out a time for himself to come over. Good boy Paul, turning into me. I also found out Heaton was always jealous of my organization skills and that's why he made fun of me! "EEEEEEEASY BIG FELLA!" I fell asleep half way through the movie concidering it was 12 at night and I've seen Reloaded over 1200 times. Then Paul woke me up and asked me a million questions and I gave him all the answers but was barely thinking because I was so tired. Then Paul left, I went to bed, next day...here I am now with NO HOMEWORK THIS WEEKEND!!! WOO!!! No band practice today, instead Dan Pat Eric and I reunited Jackbutt. It was awesome but wasn't good until the end when we slid down wooden step railings on our asses and fell on the next rail hurting our you know who's! Pat did some good damage with a little help from me giving him a boost. We also jumped from the top of Jimmy's trailer to his shed roof, that was scary. Dan jumped back from the shed to the trailer which is alot harder concidering the trailer is higher. Dan also jumped a little bridge creek thing and if he missed he'd fall into the lake or stream thing. Dan also got this awesome projector that projects onto his basement wall, we watched Finding Nemo on DVD on it, it was like watching Jesus on a wall. After all the fun, I came back home, ate dinner, actually played drums since like a week, and now I'm doing nothing. Well that's all for today. 10-4 Over and out.
