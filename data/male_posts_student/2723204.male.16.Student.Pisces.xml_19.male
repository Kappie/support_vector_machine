Like I said, i express my sadness through music, angst through essays, and love through poetry......  Btw, i've been talking so much about my piano playing. But i feel that my guitar playing has deteriorated considerably, and my amp's distortion has been increasingly crappier. I feel that my playing has been crappier as well. I can hardly do proper legato and improvise like I did in the past now...............haiz..........sad......i've neglected my "chu lian".......lol...........I've been running low on inspiration lately, i only got basically inspiration to write poems but none to write essays already, maybe its cos' i'm tired...........  lol, i'm glad that her and I are talking again, if not, this whole blog would be filled with poems. And then i'll probably end up like me friend (identity witheld) who is still depressed after the girl he liked still dun want to talk to him..............haiz..........but he's a good guy though, dunno why she dun like him.........and stuck with one pathetic guy as her boyfriend. I've been reading up on astrology and horoscopes lately, but i believe that astrological predictions has to be abstract instead of specific. But i believe that astrology is really God's guide to deterrmine our destiny.  A misconception about astrology is that everyone on this planet born on the same day, would share the same destiny etc. But really your destiny also depends on the place and time you were born et cetra. Also, i believe free will has a hand in this as well. There is a main path which is decided by your astrological sign, and that path leads to something positive, but free will allows the person to steer to a different course of a destiny, in many different parts of their life. ( anyway, that's pretty philosophical, so if you don't understand, but want to understand, read again, lol......)  I'm stopping here, i may want to go on, but its 2 am and i wanna sleep.................
