May I Introduce  Bhavya Khanna (The Guy who thinks every Exun Member is a Nutty Computer Geek)as a Formal member of Exun. Bhavya had requested a welcome on the Natural Log of Exun so he has it now.(Booo! Hisss! Who needs him? Boo! Blaaaah!) Bhavya will also be a part of the Quizzing Team.  There is also a near Dormant member of Exun. She is from Class XII and she s the 3rd senior programmer. Her Name is Swati Tuteja. She is Welcomed too!
