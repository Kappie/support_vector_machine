If I'm using the "instant" Polaroid camera Mom swears by then the images are bad, and I mean bad. So I need a digital camera. But with my mother good luck with that. Love her to death but let go a little and let me live.  OK, I really should be packing, but I don't want to, so that's the main reason behind this, nothing more or less. I'm going to miss my blog so much. And I'm going to miss talking to people online. * sigh *
