Lady please fall, my lady please fall Curiousity take this and stand tall  Someday hope my days shant be with fog So would you be so kind, and be my lapdog? Still i fight for nothing fascinating For still, my lady won't understand my reasoning  For days i've tried and sought for you to be my lapdog...
