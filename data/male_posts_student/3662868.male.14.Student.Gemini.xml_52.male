But as long as there's something to replace the erosion, the change will never stop.   I keep fueling it. Feeding it more. Filling the void with...Who knows...What should be there?   It's been so long...   The pain from it all... Forces me to adapt.    How do any of us grow?    We adapt.    Learn from the mistakes.   Who needs teachers.    Teach yourself.   You can't be taught how to live. You have to learn that.   I'm learning.      It's a cold world.   The key is to be colder.   Heartless? Yes.   senseless? It helps.   Stupid? No. That is the one thing you can't be. Not today. Not in this world. Being stupid is what makes you fall.        Because this is dedicated to the kids Dedicated to wherever music lives Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same And dedicated to the people advancin' the game What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong What's real is the kids who think they don't belong What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
