But The 2nd Part Is My Favorite Part Of The Day When I Went To The Demolition Derby And Was With The Girl I Like And It Was All Great. I Have So Much Fun With Her. She Is Just Great. She Makes Me Feel Like Im The Luckiest Man In The World. Today I Got To Work So Its All Good And Then On The 14th Of June I Got Drivers' Ed. YAY!I FINALLY GET MY LISENCE BACK!     Peace Out  Tony A.K.A. Ohio
