A wild musical comedy where Zaphod Beeblebrox sings duets with himself.  And I want all of you to help me write the hit songs!  My own submission, The Paranoid Android Blues, will be up in a little while.  This isn't a contest, just something I thought some of you would enjoy.  Have some fun with it.  And feel free to include creative reprises. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
