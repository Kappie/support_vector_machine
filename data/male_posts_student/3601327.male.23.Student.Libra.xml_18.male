I hope that I never, ever have to be on the receiving end of a critique by Mr. Hitchens.   urlLink Unfairenheit 9/11 - The lies of Michael Moore. By Christopher Hitchens   One key quote among many: " a documentary must have a 'POV' or point of view and that it must also impose a narrative line. But if you leave out absolutely everything that might give your 'narrative' a problem and throw in any old rubbish that might support it, and you don't even care that one bit of that rubbish flatly contradicts the next bit, and you give no chance to those who might differ, then you have betrayed your craft. If you flatter and fawn upon your potential audience, I might add, you are patronizing them and insulting them. "  Or further down in the same paragraph: "At  no point does Michael Moore make the smallest effort to be objective. At no moment does he pass up the chance of a cheap sneer or a jeer."   I make no bones about it - I really and truly don't like Michael Moore. I am extremely subjective about it - he rubs me the wrong way. I have no respect for his work and I have yet to see anyone successfully defend anything the man has said, written or produced. He is a propagandist, not a documentarian.   UPDATE:  don't take the quote above out of context. Take 10 or 15 minutes and read the whole article. The quote I chose is relevant to my mindset - the critique as a whole is absolutely devestating. He takes the movie apart piece by piece, not from a philosophical perspective such as the quote above.
