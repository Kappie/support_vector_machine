And I did it while listening to a .wav I ripped from the  urlLink cheerleading episode  of Joan of Arcadia.  Also Yay for Snow Days!  Also we can syndicate our blog. I know how to do it. It would expand our audience, which would be a good thing. Then again with some of the things said about a certain speech teacher, it may not. I'm syndicating What Kind of Day Has It Been. Just so you know.  Syndication: Yay or Nay?
