If you count the just kinda falls, then it's like 7 or 8 times. But yeah. It was fun none the less. oh Bonny, awwww! haha. That's an inside thing for those that went skating with us. Man, that can get annoying. Oh well. Grin and bear it, that's what I say. Anyway. Oh yeah, sorry Julie, but everyone will find out anyway. Julie locked her purse in her car with her keys in it at Bon's house. That was funny. So I had to drive everyone and then let her get her key and drive her back to Bon's go get her car. Then we all (Bonny, Julie, and David) went back home (my house) to eat dinner; sortof a birthday dinner for Dave. yeah. That was fun. We sang the birthday song to him like, a bagillion times. Then we made him blush alot. That's so fun. It's rather mean, but fun. Julie thinks it's funny, so it's all good. Afterwards, Bon and I went and watched a movie at her house. That was fun. Then I came home and now am writing this. This morning Dad took Dave out to lunch for his birthday, so David didn't get to get his liscence today, wasn't enough time; so he's going to try to get it tomorrow. yeah... it's a little scary. He's not really that bad of a driver, so I'm not worried. Well, I had best get to bed because I am tired beyond all reason. Talk to all yall tomorrow it being as tomorrow is Wednesday and all. I'm going to be so sore in the morning...
