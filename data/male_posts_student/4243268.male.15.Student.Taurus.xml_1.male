There's talk of a possible tornado about 25 miles northeast of where I live, and the sky has been turning all these different colors.  My camera is out of film and my dad's camera isn't working, or I would take a picture of the sky.  Fortunately, they say that the tornado is probably going to be moving northeast(if it even forms, which is unlikely... I mean come on, it's Pennsylvania), so that means no exciting stuff for me. Bummer.  Band camp ended today which is a big hooray for free time. Got my schedule and turns out that I have French 3 and Lunch with my best buddy at school which is a definate score. May God protect the French teacher... Shane(my bud) and I have been terrorizing French teachers at our school for 3 years now, but this is the first year we've been in a class together. Loads of fun, I'm sure.  I know a few more friends who are in my lunch, and some who are in some of my classes. It'll be a pretty cool year.  Alright, that's about it.  Bye.
