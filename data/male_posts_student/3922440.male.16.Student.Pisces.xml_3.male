I just feel that ever since I told him how i feel about him i seem to get the bad end of the bargain.  :'(   I just guess that maybe I should just forget him but it is kinda hard cuz I feel bad.  Like I went to my friends house before he was going to supposidly pick me up.  I called him and he is like oh well i am going to wait for my drinking buddies to call me I want to go to the club tonight so then that got cancelled so then he blew me off last night.  However he kept saying this morning that I was blowing him off.  What the fuck???? That is bull shit considering that he is the one who did not even hang with Amanda Sha and myself.  Dumb ass.  Then I told him that was fine or w/e then I talked to him today or earlier today at 4 this morning.  And he was like we can go to the movies todya if you want.  he said around 3 would be good for me.  I was like sweet I would like that.  Well I got up at 12 and had my coffee and did my stretches and called him and he did not asnwer and he has not called me back so now i feel like a loser.  Like I was forgotten about.  Cuz he has not called me or imed me and he is now 43 minutes late so we could not make a movie we wanted to.  I am just so confused I don't know what to do I just want to cry.  God I swear I try and make people happy and it always blows up in my face.
