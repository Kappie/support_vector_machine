We also played N64 for a while, because I rented my gamecube (like if I even touched it). We decided to drink ginger ale until we died, but after a glass of it his parents came home. I finished watching Saturday Night Live by myself, and then my mom made me go to sleep. So that I could wake up early to write this. Meh.   The End
