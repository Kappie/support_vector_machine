And it's still coming down. Possibly no school Monday? That would be good and bad. Long weekend, but also another day out of summer vacation. School is pointless to me. I don't remember any of the material after I take a test on it, so what's the point? Oh well. Is it wrong that everyday I find myself saying "I'm bored." at least 10 times. And I hear people tell that same phrase to me at least 10 times. Is life supposed to be this boring? Or is it just the sad people of Hazleton. I'm betting it's just us Hazletonians. Anyway I just got back in from playing football outside. Well, we really didn't play football. It was more of making a pathetic lump of snow and putting sticks in it and calling it a snowman, writing kindergarten.com in the snow, playing on snowcovered swings, going down ice covered slides, climbing trees (unsuccessfully), rolling trashcans, and out of everything, hurting myself. I don't even know if my hands are still there since I lost all feeling in them. Actually I lost feeling in most of my body. And I plan on doing it all tomorrow. But tomorrow I will remember to wear gloves and bring a shovel and/or broom to perhaps get rid of some of the snow. Sad how I play football better in a foot of snow and without feeling in my hands. Maybe tomorrow I will get a sled and ride down the hill by my house. Until I realize that I can't stop myself and continue to slide out of control right into the intersection. It's very hard to type when you can't feel what keys your hitting. I think I've been doing this post for at least a half hour now. So maybe I will do something smart for a change and stop writing in this blog for now, go wipe all the blood coming from my dry, cracked fingers, and dunk myself in hot water. So long.  Listen to H.I.M.
