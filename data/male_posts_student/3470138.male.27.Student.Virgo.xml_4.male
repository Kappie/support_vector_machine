They left a mess that one can only describe as prodigious and there was this sign that said "Please pick up your dog poop"  $50-$200 dollar fine.  And I'm like man thats daft.  I'll tell you what these geese made more mess than a great dan that had just eaten a pound of butter.  It was nasty.  And these people are gonna charge people for letting their dogs crap here?  Dumb dumb dumb.
