My roommates find this humorous, and enjoy poking fun at me, and though I act like they're really pissing me off, I know they mean no real harm.  We went bowling. I figured it would be a good time, hanging out with Robb, Brian, Fred, Amanda, and Andy, all of whom are better bowlers than I am...but that's nothing new. :) I had not gone bowling in a while, because it was something I used to really only do with my ex-girlfriend Joanne. It's kind of like how I only really ever smoke cigars with my friend Oliver. There's just some kind of quality to the experience that I really only enjoy with certain people. Ever get that feeling?  So we get there, and I'm looking for a ball, and Fred is waiting patiently for us, having already punched our super hero alter egos into the score board instead of our real names. Man, I love Fred. :) And then I say to myself, "Well Dave, you obviously need a ball."  Well, I'm a very visual person. I almost always pick my bowling ball for its color, considering the weight to be second to that determining factor. So I saw this really nice, dark blue swirly-looking ball, and hefted it off the rack. And what do you know, the weight rocked too!  So as I'm walking back to the lane, I'm turning this ball over in my hands to make sure it didn't have any big scratches or anything, and I came across the name printed on the ball. There in big bold letters was "JOANNE".    We'll call that weird.
