My teeth did their normal drifting and general fucking with my mouth over the past eight years, and so I am left with the lovely stigma of shiny metal in my mouth again. The upside, it's free. The downside? I'M A FUCKING BRACEFACE. Great. I've got to suffer through four months of these if I want my bottom teeth straight - Eight months if I ever want to eat a sandwich or bite my tongue again.  A brief aside to the great divine entity in charge of my destiny/teeth. FUCK YOU ASSHOLE.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled witty banter.  I played Freelancer for the better part of the night last night. I completely forgot about everything, dinner, buffy, my friends - simply because this game began to suck the soul from my body. It's great. The game begins with the premise of 9/11 in space - the station Freeport 7 (WTC) is destroyed (destroyed) by The Order (al queda) led by Orillion (Osama). Liberty (the U to the S to the of to the A) begins to crack down on terrorism (terrorism) and has begun to detain smugglers, theives and freelance booty hunters (you, you and most definately you).  So I played it into the wee hours, til the wee hours became the not so wee hours. Fucking righteous it is.   The game was designed by Chris Roberts - the chap who bailed from Origin to form digitalAnvil under the velvet gloved iron fist of Microsoft Game Studios. On the downside he brought us the 90 minute pile of tripe that was Wingcommander, the movie (which did, however, pioneer some of the camera techniques that formulate the basis of the bullet time effect found in The Matrix.... and every other piece of action cinema today). Chris is a fairly good lad - I mean, the man brought us more Mark Hamill, teamed with John Rhys-Davies (Yoooooou were named after the doooooooog??) and Malcolm "I killed Kirk" Macdowel. Wingcommander 3 has the dubious distinction of being one of the first games brought to DVD. I believe there are 5 now, four of which are various iterations of Wingcommander 3.  I've been assure that I'm not a monstrous freak now that I have braces.  LIES.
