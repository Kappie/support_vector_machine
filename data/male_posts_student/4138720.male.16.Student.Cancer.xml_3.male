That's right, a pen top. I really need to start taking glue sticks to school. It would help alot. Maybe I'll go buy a bag later. Anyway, I got threatened of getting suspended today. If I don't get my hair cut in the next day or so, I'm gone. That's real sad. Especially since my hair isn't that long. Stupid goat principal. Oh well, it happens. I was given the idea by donaldo of getting everyone who wants to have longer hair to sit out in front of the school with signs. Maybe I should get all those who want the dress code to be less strict of girls to stay out there to. We could have like... a school-wide riot or something. That would be awesome! To bad it would never happen...
