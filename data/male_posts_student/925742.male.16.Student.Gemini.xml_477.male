By the by, I showed them Ashley's picture and they agree in the thinking you are purrrty.  Heheh.  I changed my voicemail, too, and tricked Ash, hahah.  Yeah, you laughed, though.  We played some poker after that and I lost some money, but won some games, too.  It was good.  Now I'm doing this,  Sonja's coming later today (since this is saturday morning) and I have to work, AND I want to go to a party with Ashley, I'm a busy man......  I need to sleep.
