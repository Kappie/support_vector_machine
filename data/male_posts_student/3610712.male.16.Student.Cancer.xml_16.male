Meanwhile I was doing yard work and then Sarah and I went with Ravin and Dana to Santa Maria. We ate at Applebee's and drove around a little. Then we came back and picked Luke up from the party. After that we drove around with Randy following us, and we eventually ended up at Eric's house. Sarah, Luke, and I were pretty tired, so we went to his house and spent the night. On Sunday Sarah, Eric, Luke, Randy, and I hung out at my house, at chicken, and played Playstation. Randy left and eventually Eric had to leave, so we decided to go to Eric's house. We drove over to Cindy's, then walked to Cabrillo. Luke had his camera in hand and interviewed us and such on campus. It was quite entertaining. After that we went to Starbucks and then came back to my house. Sarah, Luke, and I watched television for a long time, then fell asleep. I woke them up at 5 am and told them to go home. It was good times. Au revoir. Thank you. Goodbye.
