While I can't give away a free trip or make these memories happen for you, what I can do is provide the information any boarder needs to get connected with the wider Snowoarding community and perhaps tee up the possibility of making some new friends. Who knows where it can go from there....you may be able to organise some cheap (or even free) accommodation with a new buddy, find the best snow locations this time of year, maybe even spark up a romance on-line.   It's all possible when you log-on and become a member of  urlLink  Snowboard.com . I became a member the other day and it's without a doubt the best site I've seen dedicated to Snowboarding. Best of all it's free!! I set up a user profile, posted a mugshot and gave some of my background history.  Within an hour of setting up my membership I was getting messages and chatting with other boarders across the world online. It was excellent. Not only can you chat, but there are forums for tricks, photos, jobs, accommodation, study and heaps more.  I definately recommend this bad boy to anyone wanting to get out there and communicate with the global boarding fraternity. Catch ya!
