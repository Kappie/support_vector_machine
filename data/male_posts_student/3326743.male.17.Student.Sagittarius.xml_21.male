By the end of it I had a longing to be absent in the flesh and present with Christ.  That would be awesome.  I also finished the Bible last night.  I plan now to study Hosea b/c that is what we're doing in Bible Study.  It's a great book on God's grace and mercy.  School starts soon and I look forward to the work God is going to do among us.  See ya.  Don't forget about the party!!
