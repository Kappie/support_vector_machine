The tea was a bit too hot and just singed my tongue. So maybe not drinking the tea right at this moment.  Last night I managed to get through about 50 pages of Italo Calvino's  Invisible Cities . That not saying much, because of the way the book is paginated it's more like reading 25 pages. I have another 100 pages to go. It's a weird book as Martin said, but extremely cool. The translation from Italian is still very eloquent and pretty deep in its philosophical content. I'm just not sure how it fits into the course.  I still need to read Hegel and Eco. That's my plan. To get the readings for those 2 classes done today. Will I do it? We'll see.  I have  Punch Drunk Love  sitting around, that I'll probably watch today.  ***
