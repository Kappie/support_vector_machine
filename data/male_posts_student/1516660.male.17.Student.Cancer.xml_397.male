I do not want to see chewed food coming out of my mouth while I writh in the pain of burning thorax. Yes. It's that bad. Oh! Lets not forget the stomach pains while its being sucked in to push the food out. *Shudders*    Okay die. I just found out that I can't sing, or else I will risk the prospect of vomitting! Die le la...how to sing tomorrow? Vommitting's a side issue, but my voice has grown scratchy and lost its Tenor voice. Now it resembles god-knows-what! Oh dear!    Right. Besides the osccassional sniffing of the throat and more-than-enough clearing of the throat, I did practically nothing today.    Okay. Not really nothing. I watched TV in the morning. I also finished my beta assignment for the English Elite, a club in MNI I joined not too long ago. Very nice and fancy! :) Lexi (the leader) said it was very good. O.O I never 'beta'ed before. That's good, I supposed. HaHa! Even QianQiang meowed and quacked in Tou Long Zhuan Feng! Yes!!    Okay. In the afternoon, I did my homework, which was GP and Physics. I suddenly have an urge to watch Xiao Qian, A Chinese Ghost Story. A commerical for that movie was showing on Channel 8, and I felt like watching it. Of course, I did very little GP writing as I immersed myself in the movie. Ahh well.    I carried my homework to my computer desk and I resumed work. I concluded rather suckily for GP, because I was hurrying to get it done. Heh Heh. I then hurriedly to work on PW, to solve those pesky problems that I know. Can leave the unknown ones to Miss Yee. Heh Heh.   Right. After that I lost myself to  urlLink Dangerously In Love . Pages 13 and 14 gave me problems, and thankfully, Gloria helped me to copy those pages and send to me in Words form! Thanks Gloria.   Oh Yes! You should read  urlLink He's NOT My Boyfriend ! That story made me cried bucketfuls of tears! I never cried so much! Okay...I say it almost everytime. This time, I really cried a lot! The touching scenes were extraordinarily touching! Especially the breakup, then when they reconciled. Very very gan ren. I have a softspot for fights and reconcilation. I really cried so much that my shirt was wet. I just couldn't stop! Very emotional!   Yes. I think I'll end this now. See ya! Great. Now my cold came back. See ya next time! TaTa!
