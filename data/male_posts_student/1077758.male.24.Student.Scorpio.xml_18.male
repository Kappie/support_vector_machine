I had to call into work again today, and I know they're getting pissed off at me.  (Oh no, I've called in twice in 2 and a half years, and others call in every other day without getting burned. Yeah, that makes sense.)  School's been hectic too, as we get ready for spring break.  So they like to beat us down before we go on vacation.  Another example of great human instincts. "Here's some work for your spring break so that you can relax. Mwahahaha! I'll go eat shit and die now...you wish! Gyaaahahaha!"  Dicks.
