Then she goes on this whole thing about how apparently this really influential and extremely wealthy woman called her up and asked if she knew any really good singers, and she recommended me. Then this woman told her that she's having a remembrance ceremony for her brother, who at 47 committed suicide. So my organist called me to give me a heads up forthis lady. I had never heard er name before, but the organist (who goes by the name Mrs. Goss) who has lived here for 50 years said that she's loaded and extremely powerful in NH and Massachusetts, and a HUGE patron of the arts. So i'm like  whoa  and wait by the phone. Sure enough, this woman calls and introduces herself and describes the situation that I had already learned from Mrs. Goss. Apparently she just wants someone to sing backgrond music while she has a reverend read a few psalms and whatnot and then follow her acros the road from her HUGE Rye mansion to the ocean while she scatters his ashes. She told me it would only be like 4 songs. Then she asked me, " Your fee is $100, correct?" She was indeed correct. ( Lemme give you a run down. The standard fee is 100, but the standard tip is 25) She said in reply, "I'm sure that could easily be arranged." (NOTE: Mrs. Goss told me after that the rich lady wold DOUBLE my pay if I did a good job!)      So basically on August 10th I'll sing 4 5-minute songs and get paid at LEAST $100. Does that rock or what? Share in my joy, people!The best part is I already know exaclty what I'm going to do with that money: put it in my checking account! After that I'll be all set for another SERIOUS day of shopping! Anyone interested?
