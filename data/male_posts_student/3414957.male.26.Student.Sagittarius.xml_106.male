Well, at least 90% of my homework is done. I need to re-write my hug paper in English class and do a few math sections in the book oh and also start another art project...but that can wait until later Sunday and early Monday. I will go visit Martin at his music studio Monday night and check it out and check out his computer! Maybe I can get a quick guitar lesson while I am there. Shoot, who can even start another hobby when school eates up 80% of my time and work eats up like 15% and the rest of the "free" time is traveling in between the two places!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I just realized today that I am my own best friend.   I trust myself and look forward to being alone alot so then I must be....right????? Oh well, who cares. I have nothing to look forward to except a nice funeral and possibly becoming a ghost. I would love to come back and haunt people and mess with people that I didn't like when I was alive.Hey, that sounds like a good book or movie plot. I got dibs on it.  On a smelly note. The area is now at a musty 6 out of 10 stink points.
