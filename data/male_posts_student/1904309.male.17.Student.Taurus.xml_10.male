(yes i know my tongue doesn't have an ass because then i'd be kissing ass all day) i took a boneless skinless chicken breast and diced it up, soaked it in hot sauce, cooked it. also sauteed up tomatoes and onions. put all ingredients on rye bread w/ red. fat cheddar on top. HUNGRY YET?? fuck wing night, now i can have a spicy chicken sandwich whenever i want and it DON'T COST A THING!!          yeh, anyway, today i told off one of my coworkers and almost pushed him into a pool. i havn't had the best week, you know, and he wasn't helping much. i decided it would be safest to just curse him out and go home. so i got home at 2, and am leaving my cell off so work cant call me. oh yeh, speaking of work if you for any reason go into my shop and the girl who answers phones asks about me (not expecting this to happen to anyone) i'm gay. i had to convince her i was gay this morning when i realized she was hitting on me. let me tell you, i am an AWESOME gay! i do it so well. well now i'm gonna go question my sexual preference and cry because i'm questioning my sexual preference. . . . sniff. . . bye.      1
