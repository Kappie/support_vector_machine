So aww of the hype to get a job for nothin if i get good result in exam results so now im praying to go to shitty bell-end college ah fuck. Even then I'm gonna die, living in the middle of no-where is shit i will have to get up about 6:30 then go to college or uni then straight to work then get back in about 11. Then up early again on Saturday fuck that for 4 years i struggle to get outa bed before 12. This will be a big change everybody is used to fuckin about doin nothin or no much then we will aw get fucked at the same time into doing 6 things at once i will be workin 5 and a half solid days a week, I have to start driving lessons the now fuck spending my life on a train at least if I can stick this job it will mean lessons and a vechile will be on the way, meanin no more fuckin trains. Fuck this is depressing summer is too boring no enough stuff to do to fill up the time then aw of a sudden you've not got any time and i bet we all think of stuff we wish we had time to do. I feel sorry for young Michael he has to go away into Glasgow Uni extra half an hour there and back. Aw well Andy and Craig started uni this time last year and they can drive now so..... plus we'll be 18 so we can spread the wings further than Franklyns which is a tad pish.  Aye so who knows a good instructor then outa the 2 people that read this. Ciao
