Desperation? I think frustration, should be the one. I was there, thinking and thinking... That's all I seem to do lately. It got to the point in which I felt out of breath, sad, lonely and ultimately bored. I got vocation's anxiety, and it made me feel poorly in shape. In reality is not at all just that, we know what I am talking about, don't we? I keep torturing myself, music-wise, movie-wise, even food-wise. I just keep coming and coming to it. Everyone tells me to get a grip and start moving around... I seem unable to do it. Anyway, what's to do? What's to do when the only way to meet someone is compromising for the things you just don't want to do? And in the case you find someone this way, how true the relationship is if it got to you in a way that does not reflect your life? ... I think, that maybe I lost a chance with someone that could've been the real deal just because I did not have the balls to move on. Now he moved on. LOL, ironic?  My friends try to give me advice, and in fact they just say what I know is true already. Let's be clear, I know my feelings are all wrong, still, I think that it was a long time since I felt this way, since I felt something at all. It was so long ago, that I was numb. Now even depression is a way of feeling. Bastard! All in all, I try to live my life, be busy, this four weeks have been a roller coaster of situations, from the most normal and simple to the big and scary ones. Three of my best friends, my closest friends are tying the knot and it just made me feel depressed. -I know, I know, I'm selfish, I should be happy for them, I am, for real. Just, mmh, well ok, I always think of me first-.   On Monday night we ( my friends and I ) were talking about it over dinner, suddenly, as one of them was so happy for her situation, I just felt miserable, totally miserable. It made me remember so much. -Why does everything seems bittersweet when you are alone?-. Alejandra, that's my friend's name, said that she is getting married because is the best decision for her, and she doesn't want to be 30 and thinking "what could've been?" She asked for advice, and I just stood there, sitting and staring at the wall, fork in hand. Flashback. I said to her that " what could've been? " is not an option. Now, I think of Neil and I say the same. What could have been? -Why does a mature decision, a decision that was made with all heart and total mind still hunts? It's the what could have been factor... I keep coming to it, and I keep tracing my relations, all of them had that one as a bar, and it always has been a high one. Still, I don't think moving with him to Boston would have been the right choice, I was young, and maybe too immature. Yes, we were the same age, but he had a different life than the one I had then, and still have and even so, I keep thinking: what would've been?-. I miss him! Ha ha ha, how can you love two at the same time? None is near, none is in contact, one I lost contact with, the other one  is not in love with me. Ah, the Tangled Web We Wove... Humans are the only ones that get themself in this position. And we love it. Don't we?  Monday the 12th was my birthday and I got all the love from family and friends... One of the saddest day so far. I'm so upbeat am I not? LOL...! To make matters worse my ex-boyfriend's ( The big C ) birthday is the 13th, I was compelled to call and say hi... But no, no, no, no... That would've been a really bad decision. Anyway, for those who care and read this: Love!   urlLink    ... urlLink
