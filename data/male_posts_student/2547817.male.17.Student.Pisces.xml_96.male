Tacky spiderman design overlays the transparent side. Pretty fast. 2.4GHz- I'm glad it's better than a 200MHz. I'm thankful.  Went for drama auditions today. Went well. They said that Leon and I worked well together and that they'd cast us together, more than once. That means more work, but what the hell lah. It's exposure, and that's what I need. Also got put in Aldersgate which plays on Monday. I know nothing about the play and I have to sing the first verse of a song. "And can it be" it's called. I'm supposed to be really happy. Just that, I'm not. Why?  Went to church. Did dancing for the children. There were these 3 mockers. I'm not proud of what I did. I will be stronger the next time. Or am I fooling myself.  Fought with Wei Xin. The deal was that since he didn't have any money, I'd pay the $21 for his ACJC choir concert ticket, and he'd pay me back. My contact bought all the tickets with his own money and now Wei Xin messages me telling me to cancel his order. He refuses to acknowledge that he should take responsibility for what he said he'd do. I called him and blasted him. What a donkey. "Just coz I said ok, and that I'd pay you in the day itself, doesn't mean I agreed to buy the ticket. It's just means that I would consider it, so you should have put my name under the uncertain column." What rubbish. Naive fool. He can't argue without letting his emotions get in the way. Shan't go into that to save him embarrassment.  Will knock some sense into him the next time I see him.  Bitter-sweet days are gay.
