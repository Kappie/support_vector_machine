My deepest sympathies; my week felt as though the crappid (yes, my own word) thing would NEVER END.   Today I had to do the St. Patrick's Day Parade.   Here are the  factors that caused it to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had in public.  1) New people in the band - sucky piping. 2) It was BELOW FREEZING. Not even the best of us can play worth crap when our hands are frozen stiff. 3) We were literally forced to wear green leis, making us all look very dorky. Kilts + leis = disaster. 4) I had to be at work for a special event at 2:00. We started moving at 12:15. I hate rushing. 5) I just hate parades.  Then I went to work, which I won't talk about because I'm too lazy.  I'd like to give my deepest sympathies to everyone who went to the game on Friday. We lost and you only got to watch the last few minutes because the fan bus was invaded by cheerleaders because their bus broke down. This was only the freshmen who had to get off, of course. People are very unfair. However, I'm indefinitely glad I wasn't able to go.   Quote of the Day  Life is just one damned thing after another. (Elbert Hubbard)
