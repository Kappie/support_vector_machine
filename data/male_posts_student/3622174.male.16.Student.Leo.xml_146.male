Things are gonna be so different...how will I be able to handle it?!  The thought of starting work on another yearbook...new classes, my brother being around...it's all happening to fast already.  Blog of Bagel will be back tomorrow with more...for now, I think I'm going into shock.  Adios Bloggers.
