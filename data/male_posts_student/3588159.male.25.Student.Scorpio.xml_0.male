Wangerin is a real  storyteller , and not in the dubious* sense of the word (as misused on the backs of cheap fantasy novels). His narrative is compelling without being contrived. His dialogue is beautifully crafted. The characters hold you captive for 200+ pages and it’s hard to fight your way out. Simple enough for children, profound enough for adults, this book ranks with the likes of  Watership Down  and  Animal Farm  and compares favorably to the hallowed  Chronicles of Narnia . As you’ve probably guessed,  Dun Cow  is a book about animals. And no, the title is not terribly compelling. (A factor in the book’s relative anonymity?) But read it. I laughed, I cried, I bought it, I read it semi-annually, I give it away to my friends… and you will too.   This word was used in association with   urlLink  The Vocabulary Reclamation Project.     *Dubious. An elegant way to say something is of questionable character. A claim that's ambiguous, evasive, or flat-out dishonest. Synonyms are: doubtful, fishy, shady, suspect, suspicious.
