I suppose it wasn't like last year (to which I didn't go, because no one told me about it), which I imagine was more fun than rewarding. Beside the point, anyways, I'm exhausted, mentally, physically, and perhaps spiritually.  I'm tired physically because I stayed up late listening to the guest pastor, Rev. Tony Costa and because I played badminton. I'm mentally tired because I learned a lot, thought a lot, and had little time to sleep and recover. I'm spiritually tired because..., well, who nos.  Tony Costa is a really interesting man. Like I no he's visited our church before but I was never there... Anyways, during the first Message, I was pretty much analysing him, like I do with all public speakers. He's confident and definately nos what he was talking about. By the end of the worship service, or third Message, I admired him not only as a speaker, a man of knowlege, and a man of faith, but a human being as well. He's a man who does, thinks, and believes what he does so fiersely, passionatly, and absolutely that I can hardly comprehend. He's the type of Christian that would've been killed a long time ago if this was J.C.'s time.  Anyways, I've come to a personal revelation. I've been aware of this for sometime but it hasn't been this clear in my mind before retreat. For awhile, I've analyzed, from an objective point of view, Christianity. I've come to the conclusion that Christianity is the best explained, if not only, logical belief. Similarly, I've concluded that a Christian lifestyle, from a completely non-spiritual view, would be, at worst, neutral to my current life. My final conclusion: I've nothing to lose.  I've known this for a long time. But I never really put my real concern into a conherent thought before. I want to be genuinely Christian, but I can't. I've prayed and prayed for the Holy Spirit to touch me but it hasn't. And God nos, only the Holy Spirit can bring me to truly accept Christ in my heart. It's like the devil has me captive and just won't let me let go... My solution for now is this: strive to live a Godly life and to keep praying. That and ask for others to pray for me too...  I'm really a sinful person. I haven't really even tried to live up to God's standards. Maybe this is y I haven't recieved the Spirit. That will change. It has to.
