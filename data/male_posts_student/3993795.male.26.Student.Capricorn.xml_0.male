It's gonna happen, believe it or not.   My name is Ittai. It's a very common name here, in Israel, and I guess in many ways, I'm a very common guy. Or maybe not?   Just until recently I was a student in Tel Aviv university, in the center of Israel.Working on a BA inEast Asian studies and Computer Science - What a mixture, ah?   Besides that I had, actually still have, a job as a development manager in my dad's startup company, Motivia. Things are not clear about whats gonna happen with that job, and I have a lot to say about that, but not tonight (baby, I'm tired).   Anyways, that's really not what I came here to talk about. As I mentioned before, I'm leaving Israel for a while, I'm going to Beijing, the capital of China, and I'm going there to study Chinese. The place where I'm going to study is called Beijing Language and Culture University, we'll call it  BLCU  to save some keystrokes, allright? Or maybe we'll just call it  Beiyu , as the Chinese do.   Enough about me for now, let's go back to discuss my list.  The 14th item in the list was  "Open B-Log."           So here I am, opening a blog. I hope it would be interesting, exciting, blah, blah..  If not exciting, then maybe it'll help me improve my English.  If not improve my English, then maybe help me meet women,  If not meet women, then   well,  who knows ? :-)   Till later   Yi Tai  איתי  伊太   (That was my name in 3 different languages - How many can you recognize?)
