Both events were a blast in the end! haha... why? haha... got lots of reasons but i shall explain later on! haha... so interesting! :p  The Mega concert certianly was a blessing in diguise! haha... Not only did i get to see Kelly in make up for the 1st time ever! but also, i finally got to take a picture with her! YEAH! haha... ok, so maybe to her, it wasn't that fantastic a picutre, but to me, it was really a blessing and i am so overjoyed to have taken it! Ooh! Kelly looks really fabulous lah! wah lau... i don't understand why she is so camera shy loh! She really looks good and stuff, but so afraid to take pictures! Haha... the full feeling of it, i shall not explain but, she will understand in due course. However, all i can say is that with the entire thing, i felt a heavenly bliss, a feeling that i've not felt for such a long time, i have no idea how it felt like till that day! haha...  Ok, the Bible quiz... haha... so, we didn't really win. But i guess, the overall experience was really fun and enriching! heex... so cool lah! i never did realise that we could enjoy the learning and sharing as well as the understanding of the bible in such a fun way! haha... and to do it with friends was even more of a blessing! All right! ;p i once thought it was simply just standing there and answering qs, but i am so happy to be proven wrong! With obstacle courses, running, avoiding being caught by the 'police' and of course! A memory that i won't forget so soon... getting doughed! haha... though we did not win the quiz physically, at least we won in more ways than 1! haha... Learnt to trust each other even more and learned to place our faith more in the Christ and the Lord! heex... really enjoyed myself! Don't worry! We shall take part again next year! and... we shall win back the championship!  Hmm... the only bad thing... Parents - teacher dialouge... ok... so it didn't really go well lah... i had lots of glowing reports about my attitude, behaviour... Helpful, responsible, nice, blah blah blah... the usual things that i have been hearing since Primary 6... but... Not putting enough effort in to my studies! Crap lah! ok lah... guess in reality, it's true... so, well... i am not going to give up, but i shall buck up! Trust me on it! I SHALL!!!  haha... ooh! i finally got a picture of Meiyi in a dress! haha... she looks good lah! haha... but, i will put the picture up another day... all i can think of now is the bliss and happiness that engulfed me with regards to the picture that i took with Kelly! haha... Take care everyone! Keep Smiling! :p
