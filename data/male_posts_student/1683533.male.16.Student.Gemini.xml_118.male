Hung out with Kate till like 6:30, then walked over to the rec center for the battle of the bands.  OK, here were some things that sucked about it: 1. The damn little kids thinking they are so hardcore.  Then they freak out as soon as the big guys jump in.  2. The first band, Literi Fatali or something, they sucked and they had a stupid ass shirt that had a pic of a bloody wrist and under it says "cause chicks dig scars"...sick fucks...  3.  The reprocessed crap screamo band, Fool of Fortune  4. The security people not letting me and marty have any fun cause of the little kids.  We could mosh.  There were some very good highlights of the evening though:  1. The band Daniel, they were good  2. Fool of Fortune not even placing  3. Paul Knorp falling in the mosh pit and then curling into the fetal position  4. When this huge ass kid knocked down three kids at once.  5. teaching little kids a lesson in the pit  Yea, anyways, it was a decent show, but definitly not worth 7 fucking dollars. At the end me and marty rolld down the hills outside and asked the cops what time it was and they said 12:10 but later on when my mom picked us up it was only 10:30. What the fuck?  Anthrophobic Youth (winners of Battle of Bands in october or something) did not play.  I have been hearing alot of stuff about Derek McMullen lately, supposedly he went to a Faith meeting (christian after school gathering thing) and they hypnotized him and now he morphed into this pure person, church every week, cut his mohawk off, the works.  I dont know if I believe it, but I think that is funny as hell if its true.  After that I went to bed and woke up and went to work.  I have several nicknames now.  The dishwashers call me Jerry.  The waitresses call me Afro Joe and one girl calls me Jack because I guess I look like Jack Osbourne? uh ok...  This weeks schedule: monday: after school study thing tuesday: something with kate like usual wensday: after school thing, and then practice around 4 or 5 thursday: work friday: work saturday: 9miles2go concert? sunday: probably work  my schedule has been so fucking tight latly, once this AP test thing is over I will be more open though...  Ok, apparently my cousin was waiting in line for the Suicide Machines concert last night early.   Jay (lead singer of SM) comes out and Ben (my cousin) follows him to his car and asks him to listen to his Designed By You cd and possibly consider him for the annual X-mas show if he likes it.  Jay says, fuck that, lets listen to it now.  So he plays it in his car and says he likes it and sees no reason why he wouldnt be able to play in the X-mas show....is that insane or what?  Ben is pretty lucky, that would be a dream for me to play with the Suicide Machines.  But if he gets in for the X-mas show, I definitly am going.  Also, I guess my mom's friend's Cousin is the lead singer of Less Than Jake.  My mom's friend is a teacher and she is 23 and she likes the Suicide Machines (would that be a kick ass teacher to have in elementary school or what?).  My mom told her how I liked Suicide Machines, then she told my mom to tell me about her cousin who is the lead singer of Less Than Jake.  Pretty cool.  Anyways, it is late and I still have homework to do.  Also, if you want to see some possible logos for the band I am working on IM me on AIM.  Peace.
