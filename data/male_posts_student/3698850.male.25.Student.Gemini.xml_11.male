Here in the US it is repressed, even in the most sexually free people.  Women seem to be even more into it than men, but the trick is bringing it out in them. I used to say that I wish people would have more orgies, but now that I realize that many attractive people do, I just want Vanessa and I to be invited.  At least I have dreams.
