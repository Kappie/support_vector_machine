They had a new obstacle course, which was cool, no trampoline this time though, that's fine, I'll just jump on mine... I bought this really cool hat in the beginning but let my friend borrow it for the first couple hours of the edge,(the edge runs from 6pm-11pm), but then I got back and was wearing it when a group of 15 people came over and accused me of stealing their fiends hat, which was really bougus. But then my friends: Justin, Anthony, Becca, Selina, Michael, Megan, Erica, Ariel, Rita, and John, came and backed me up. Then went to one of the edge staff members, who unfortunately was a friend of Selina's, and had acctualy seen me buy the hat, so that was that... well not exactly they went to 3 more edge staff members, before the put out a bullitan on the walie-talkies about people wanting a hat from me, and if they did, they would have to go home! After that I saw someone running the BIG JUMP Slide that I knew from when she visited my health class, and it was really cool, she let us get cuts for about 2 hours as long as no one in line said anything! it was so awesome! Well anyways, that's Friday...  Bored Day #5 Saturday, May 22, 2004    Saturday was pretty boring, we dug a small ditch aroung the house, powerwashed the house and cleaned off the porch, after that we watched Miricle.  Bored Day #6 Sunday, May 23, 2004    Today was a little bit better than yesterday, we sprayed the new siding for the house with primer, we just got a new paint sprayer. Now we just have to prime the rest of the house, then paint, then were done, anyways...                                             GOOD NIGHT
