 At long last I finally made my first anamorphic DVD in true 16x9 format.  This means that when you watch it on a 4x3 TV it will be letterboxed.  When viewed on the computer through the DVD player it shows up as rectangular.  The test DVD I made contains a molecular animation for the third annual Idaho BRIN conference that takes place in August.  I'm going to be presenting a poster and a film of my work.
