Hostettler, 8th U.S. Congressional District Indiana on October the 16th, 2003. The resolution as brought to the floor of the House and passed on July 22, 2004 reads, in summary:    Marriage Protection Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal judicial code to deny Federal courts jurisdiction to hear or decide any question pertaining to the interpretation of: (1) the provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that provides that no State shall be required to give effect to any marriage between persons of the same sex under the laws of any other State; or (2) this Act.    Let's see what this means. HR 3313, if passed by the U.S. Senate (it won't), would not allow any Federal court to hear or rule on cases questioning or relating to the legality or interpretation of the  urlLink 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (104th Congress) , as well as question H.R. 3313 if it were to become a law. Essentially, the GOP couldn't get their  urlLink marriage amendment passed (House Joint Resolution 56)  passed at all, so they got scared. If they couldn't make a ban on gay marriage legal in the Constitution, they decided that banning judicial review on the DOMA was a good idea. So they get all of their corrupt conservatives selves together and draft a resolution to prevent courts from saying a ban on gay marriage violates the Constitution. Since they KNOW that restricting judicial jurisdiction is a no-no in America, they want to make sure no court can undo what H.R. 3313 would do. Since when can Congress make a law that defies the 1st and 14th Amendment, as well as common since and equality, and not let a court strike it down because it's unconstitutional? Sometimes the GOP makes me laugh. H.R. 3313 will never make it past the Senate. The House passes stuff all the time that never even makes back-page news. Hell, there's been so many amendments to the Constitution proposed in the house, like flag burning, adding something about motor vehicle infractions, etc.
