I've gotten back into guitar already........yay!!!! Cos' i was really in the "rock" kinda mood, and I've actually learnt one thing, ever since I got back into playing guitar, I actually learnt one thing, which can be summarized into one word......."finesse"........Yah..........what really is Finesse? Finesse is skill to put it in simple words. I used to be able to do mean triplets and shred like mad.........but i can say, now my shred sounds as if there's something big jammed inside the paper shredder...........lol. But my Bends, vibratos, dynamics and sense of expression has really improved tremendously. I never knew simple passages which I played in the past can be done so tastefully..........and using pentatonics can beat some fancy scale/mode in which I picked up from somewhere. Getting down to basics imo................  okok, now my essay's up next...........
