It doesn't hurt as much as it did last night but it still feels lousy.  I mean, it is good that I finally have a definite answer and all of this is resolved but it doesn't take away from how I feel.  It is just like I am waiting to have that sigh of relief where I know everything is over.  But that hasn't happened yet.  Soon, though.  Soon it will happen.  But for now I will still think about her.  It doesn't help me to do that and I know it but I don't really want to stop myself, at least yet.  But it is time to stop feeling bad and just pick myself up.  It's not like we were going out for the last 4 years anyway.  I got dumped without going out with her ever.  And I still have her as a friend.  So for now it is tough.  In the future it can hopefully be better.  The only thing I know that can make this feeling go away is to be in the company of another that I feel an attraction to or at least feel comfortable with.  The problem is that I need to find this person first.  Merry Christmas!
