If you are an insomniac comment and tell me why you hate it so much.  After a while my posting will decrease after my schoolwork starts to increase. Remember kids: school blows. There isn't anything you can learn in school that you can't learn on the street. Just look at Albert Einstein. He grew up a poor German boy. Then he failed math, science, couldn't tie his own shoes... maybe I should have picked a better example... But you have to admit, that guy was a fucking genius.
