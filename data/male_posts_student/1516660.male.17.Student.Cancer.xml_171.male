Father woke me up today. Ha! It turned out that Mum, who was supposed to wake me, fell asleep. Father said, "If I never woke you all up, when are you gonna sleep until?". Ha! I then bathed, and the three of us went out lor.  Firstly, we went to the market in Marsiling to eat breakfast. Me and Mom ate kueh chap (again!), while Dad ate praqn noodles. Meow meow!! After eating, Mom went to the market to get some things while Dad went to buy 4D. Meow!! They wanted to buy some shorts for brother, but they didn't in the end. All the shorts my brother hates, according to them.  Next, we went to Sheng Shiong in Woodlands Central. Woah!! The reception there is so lousy!! Because I am "chatting" with XC and WQ via SMS, it was very vexing to see most of my messages cna't be sent, and I have to run outside to send SMS. Ergh!!! I am 'perpetually vexed'!Anyway, we brought a lot of household goods. Me-ow meow!! After Sheng Shiong, we set off towards Guan Xiang Chye in Geylang. Mother wants to get some vinegar and cooking supplies.   En route, I looked at Sheng Shiong's reciept. I noticed hor, they liked to charge things to some weird figures (like $1.44). Why they want to charge in $0.01 prices? 1 cent coins are no longer in circulation le ma. Mother told me, if the cent is below $0.05, the shops will round down to nearest 10 cent. If it is above $0.05, shops would round down to nearest $0.05, instead of rounding up to $0.10. Mother shoudl know. She works as a cashier Strange leh! Either way, the shop lose money. Mother say if they round up, the customer pays for extra. Meow!! This reminds me of the time shops used to charge things $1.99, and call them cheap. Hello! This is practially $2!! Cheap meh? I think they deliberately do that to make the product look cheapter, becuase the '1' figure looks smaller than '2'. Stupid really! You might as well be paying $2 for a $1.99 goods. I would always scoff at the $1.99 prices. Meow!!   Okay...we arrived at Guan Xiang Chye. Mother brought vinegar, some flour and dunnoe what items there. Meow meow!! We left the place at 12. We then arrived home at 12.30.   That brother ar! Came home so late! I was so hungry you know!! Meow meow!! Went back to Woodlands Central to eat lunch. So nice, the yi mee! Okay okay....came back and called WQ over. He's studying SS with me today.  Yeah...he came at 3!! So late that idiot!! He came here and studied Substainable Development. He asked me questions on how to explain and link factors to the topic. I tried my best to make him understand. I also studied my SS and Physics while he's there. Meow meow!! He's very kaypoh. And I wonder what will he think today about my house? Very noisy? HaHa! The door keep banging when I close it. And it was so loud he had to close his ear everytime I shut the door. Meow meow! After studying, he came online lor. Meow!!  Okay....after that, surfed more internet while parents buy dinner back. Ate dinner and watched TV, then came online. I think I stop writing le la. Survivor's almost showing, don't wanna miss it. See ya tomorrow! Bye blog!
