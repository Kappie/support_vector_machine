It was good in parts, but lost points with some poor acting and a plot that doesn't entirely make sense at times. Not to me, anyway. Also, whilst I was in town I got some blank DVDs so I can burn off some of the crap on my computer that I don't need but don't want to get rid of. You know how it's like :D Also, I bought Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live in Hyde Park too, which is the best damn album I've bought in years. If you like that genre of music, then go get it. Now! Then on Monday we went to the Alderburgh Carnival, which is held every year; it's a torch-lit procession down the main street, and then fireworks on the beach. Made for some really great night-time photo's. Just a pity I don't have a camera. Tuesday was my sister's birthday; 18 now, and we got here some tickets to a concert. My parents bought here a laptop too, to take to Uni. We went out and had a nice meal in the evening too, which was all good and nice. And right now I'm becoming slowly addicted to playing Eve Online. It's a MMORPG game; not really exciting or hugely fun but you can't help but come back and get your character a little further, or earn him some more money.  Anyway, I'm off to read some more online comics. What do I recommend?  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del ,  urlLink VG Cats  and  urlLink Applegeeks .
