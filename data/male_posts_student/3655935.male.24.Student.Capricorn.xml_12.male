There is a scene early in the movie where Brad Pitt’s character is the "super-me."  He’s funny, charming, brilliant, and a smooth gentleman.  Susan (ably played by Claire Forlani) is putty in his hands.  Immediately after meeting Susan, Pitt’s character is killed in a delightful car accident (completely unbeknownst to Susan).  Then, Death incarnate assumes the body of Pitt’s character, and meets Susan again as Death (once again, completely unbeknownst to Susan).  Of course, this time his personality is much different, and she poses the question that is the title of this blog.  This made me wonder.   Am I really the fun, happy, smooth character at the beginning of the movie,  or  am I the quirky, awkward, out of place character throughout the rest of the film?  I believe I once was the suave Pitt character, but now I’m death incarnate to the ladies.  I’m not sure what exactly has done this, but perhaps I can blame my intensive studies.  I ponder this thought because of Death’s response to her question, with which I will close this blog:   "I’m sometimes not quite at home around people.  I get busy doing what it is I do.  And I don’t seem to have developed....  I have a certain function to perform, and it seems to take up most of my time.  But sometimes I speculate.  But I haven’t left room for anything else."
