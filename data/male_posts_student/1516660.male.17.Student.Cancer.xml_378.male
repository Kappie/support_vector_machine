Distractions has distracted me and it's 9.55 now. Gotta go watch Friends, then I'll be back. This is basically a nonsensical, filler paragraph. Yes!   Back! Oh my god! Mike proposed to Phoebe! Oh my god!   Right. Okie dokie. Mornings were a tad boring. Well, I played PoA. Even exploring the rooms during nighttime is meowingly fun. Yep. I was almost late for meeting my friends, but of course, I turned out to be the earliest (whoop-de-doop! big surprise!).   We were going to collect our O Level Certs. Me, WQ, CQ and Gloria. We took 962 there. We waited for Joyce at the busstop. WQ is terribly embarassing. He went up to get Miss Tan to do surveys for him. ...! Okie.We met YiChun and Janet and we all went to Causeway Point to eat.  I begrudingly ate ban mian. I don't like the pork lard...but there are nothing else to eat le. Sigh. After that, we toured Causeway Point, then we went home lor.   After bathing, I played PoA till Harry gets the Carpe Retractum spell, then I watched TV and ate. Then I came online. Tada.   Right. WQ has already left for Thailand. Bon voyage and don't let the plane kill you. Sawadikap!   Right. Right now, I am engrossed in the book I brought. The Time Traveler's Wife. Oh my lord! It's terribly captivating! The story is so good...it makes me craving for more and more. The tender love between Henry and Clare. The time travelling adventures. The thrill. Oh my lord! I want to devour this epitome! Such greatness! I will, of course, give a complete review once I've finished with this book. Until then, rot in suspense. :P  Right. So I'll just go off and read mah book. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!
