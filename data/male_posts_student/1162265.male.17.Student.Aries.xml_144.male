So you feel you've said something to the whole world, but at the same time none of them consciously understand.    Football game to day?  Depressing, especially with the huge turn out.  Work? So much of it to do.    New story idea (since the last story I posted will remain incomplete), about biting nails and negative emotions around a person.  Something very relevant, and far deeper then it'd seem.    Eye itches.  Weekend?  What the hell am I doing this weekend?    Gaia, crazy stuff.  Crazy, crazy stuff.  It's pretty fun stuff now that we have an audience of Freshmen to talk strangely about.  While they all group together into some strange little cabal (not unlike us...)  sounds like a microcasm.  Johnson and Afghanistan-Solider teacher having a love affair?  Hmmmm....
