Or if you have a lover maybe you want to tell him or her ,for me I dont have one because I am a laughter boy in front of the people and I will share my love to everyone.  -Criticism  For it I will not do anything but ponder about it for a while I mean 1-10 mins.After that i will relfect and learn from my mistake and throw the comments out of my mind.All comments whether is it good or bad is all a lesson for us because in order to let people to cirticis on us definately have mistakes and things in our life or things that we dois wrong.So we should learn from all the comments said about us and not be angry of it .All tohse who have said about me or my close friends you should know that I will say:Thank You for your comments .Because I can change myself.Although I dont show it out on my face but I really think of my wrong doings at times.  So no matter what others say about you ,dont take it to hard on yourself because we need the time to think about what mistakes we have done.And for children out there dont get angry of what your teachers or elders(Parents)say about u because they want you good .I am a child I know.  To my mother and father:  I am sorry if I get annoyed when you say bad things about me because I am really sorry I know that u mean well so I will learn to change o.k  Whatever it is be happy and god will bless you .
