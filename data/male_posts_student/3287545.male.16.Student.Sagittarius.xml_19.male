I stated with IT, which was just as boring as usual,  Then in RE, we had this religious rock band kinda thing come in, which was a total imbasesment. We had to do these dance moves and things along with the band. It was quite interestingthough. One of the woman was talking about when she had an abortion and it was really sad, she was almost crying, and I swear if she had I would have to. I could feel myself welling up but I managed to hold it in. In science I felt quite alone to start with. Lloyds pissing me off right now. I found these new friends and I want to start afresh, specially with what’s happened recently, but Lloyd keeps me back, I can’t be gay with him around. Then gemma and laura asked me what I’m gonna do about Katie, I said I didn’t know, and we sort of briefly mentioned a few ways of going about it. But with Lloyd there I couldn’t really talk. It was later on in tutor that I found myself talking to Charlie about it. She asked me when we were waiting outside what I was going to do with Katie, I sort of said I could either break it up with her, and give a false reason, or tell her with the real reason, that she’s the wrong sex, or I could wait and see if I’m moving away in which case the break up will be externally forced, if that makes sense. Then when we were in tutor she sat next to me and we and Amy had a bit of a laugh. In tutor there is a pretty clear devision between the two halfs of the room, and we were all saying that we were the real cool ones because we didn’t actually have to say we were cool. I sort of managed to get in a comment about that half of the room being all those macho boys, which hopefully ment something to Charlie, ie, I’m not one of the macho boys. Today I wore makeup to school. I think It gives my skin a better look, but I think I need to still experiment a little more to get it right. I’ve also just discovered johnsons baby lotion, it makes your skin so smooth so I’m defiantly gonna try that tomorrow morning. I thinkit’s about time I started buying my own face masks and stuff instead of using my mums stuff. I’m starting to really not care wehether my parents no my sexuality. The other day my dad and uncle were making some really homophobic comments and I so wanted to just shout out I’M GAY, but I didn’t, I wouldn’t.
