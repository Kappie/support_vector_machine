Well that wasn't really the highlight of the day, because I started to step up my little gameplan.   As I said in the earlier post, I need so badly to step up into Fairplay's shoes. Guess what people? I'm already on to it! I initiated a whole chain of jokes about Mr. Mad Devendran. I'm telling you, by the crowds that surrounded my table, I think I may be even better than I thought.  Today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school. Ironic really, that I announce my leaving on this day too. Anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me. The starters were really great... Prawn salad or something like that. The clam chowder, though a far cry from my mum's standards, was far better than I expected. The rest was ok... until the horrid dessert.  Away from the food, the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling. I guess it's because there are now torches for the Survivor: OM in December. Something in the hall really didn't feel right, and it was because I was sitting next to a bunch of people that I used to be comfortable with, but I am not comfortable with anymore. I was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving... And I just didn't feel good. I really don't know whether it's because I'm leaving, or because I found that I had no real friends.
