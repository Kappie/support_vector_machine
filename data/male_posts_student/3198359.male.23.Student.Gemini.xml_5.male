Absolute crap is on television at this moment; if it isn't a half-baked "reality tv" programme, its some documentry that tells the obvious to the viewer. Never mind, I've always got more study, testing the latest version of Camino/Thunderbird and of course, posting a few rants on "me old blog" ;-)  Oh, and its been 2 days since my last caffine fix! ahh! giving up is hard, believe me, I had a splitting headache all day :-( oh well, apparently, it gets better after a week. You're probably asking, "why the f**k are you giving up that greatest thing in nature", simple, I'm a crappy sleeper and caffine doesn't make the situation any better. Oh well, lets hope I have a decent sleep tonight, another long day tomorrow.
