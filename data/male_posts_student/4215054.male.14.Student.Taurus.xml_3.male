At the moment i'm not in a good mood, I'm working on cPanel (never have before) and trying to import a template...I don't understand and everyone that I seek help from is either busy or not there.  Anyway, Today has been not very busy. I watched 6 simpsons episodes :P. I also watched Peter Kay's Bolton Hall video again.  I went to tennis, like I normally do on Fridays... I just mess around with a few mates so thats kinda fun.   Im still on with the PHP, it seems to be getting easier as I go along, but it is still difficult. The forum is going smoothly at the moment as well. I'm not involved in a mates website, www.infaredstudios.digiwire.org I have been making the forum and will soon be helping with his cPanel if he needs it. The site is about free graphics, signatures and avatars. I am good mates with him, he must feel the same because he game me his password to his cPanel...  Well, Talk laters!
