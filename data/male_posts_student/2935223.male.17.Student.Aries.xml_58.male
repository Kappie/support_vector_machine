I have absolutely nuthin' to do, so what do I do...I update my blog!!!  I would say sumthin' about how I've been on a soul-searching quest, or or give sum advice to people or sumthin'...but, I can't..I'm just not that deep I guess.   Hm..what's new.... I wish Keli was here or sumthin'...whenever Keli is around, I feel better.  I feel so full of life, and I just wanna get up and do sumthin'.  Unfortunately, there is about 5 miles of River Falls between us.....so, feelings of life are gone and motivation to get up and do anything has dropped to insanely low levels. besides play at Glen Park. I HAVE FOUND AN AWESOME HOBBY!! Playing on the toys at Glen Park. Seriously, it is SO much fun you can't even begin to imagine...maybe I'll get sum people together and do that tonight...I dunno.  It sounds kinda fun. I luv goin' to Glen Park, it rox...when I'm playin' on the toys, I can forget all my troubles, and can leave all that stuff behind.  It's just me, a toy, and a few of my best friends playin' a game intended for 4 year olds. I would gripe about other things...but, after reading Cobian's and Brendan's blogs, it makes me not want to say anything really..and people getting angry about things I say...not pointing an fingers or anything.*cough*Tina*cough*  j/k Tina, it's kool. That is the one thing I'm going to say....I have an F'ed up friendship with Tina....one day, we'll totally be pissed at eachother, the next day one of us will forgive the other one, and then life goes on.  Even though I'm still afraid of her, and I seemed to make her paranoid of all humanity....sorry. I dunno... YOU KNOW WHAT SONG ROX?!?!?!?!  BEHIND BLUE EYES by Limp Bizkit Yes I know they didn't do the song first, but they made it kool... I think I have to go now..finally sumthin' to do!!! w00t! P.S. Tontie and Grow ROXOR THE WORLD!!!! Peace!  Spense
