Mdm Cao got a new hairstyle...but unfortunately the teaching style is still as boring as ever. Evidence in the fact that someone nearly fell asleep today. ...Then, for assembly, there was sex education or something to that extent. Rather, puberty. However, the Q turned out to one of the funniest ones in exsistence(camp briefing was also good). Masturbation and castration turned out to be only a few of the topics covered.   Today, Our CS teacher Mr Yong had a dental appointment, so it was double history. Played a game and did some group work, where the teacher found me a group by appealing to then to accept me as usual. Not bad really. Found out that we wouldn't be changing groups today, though it doesn't really matter to me when I'm sitting at the back of the class. I'm looking for a group to take me in(lots of group seem ok except for one of them in the group).  STILL have to do my CRP and MRP. DOung Wizard of OZ. Goin to do now. Bye peeps.
