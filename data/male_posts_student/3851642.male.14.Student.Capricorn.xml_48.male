As of now, this is what I do every day.   9 to 10 ish: Wake up 10-12 ish: Do Bio HW 12-12:30 ish: Lunch 12:30 - 1: Read a book 1-7ish: Bio HW 7-7:30: Dinner 7:30-11: Bio HW 11 to 2:30ish: Talk to Dez and Watch Adult Swim  Yup. Thats my life. It really is boring. I need to DO something. I need a LIFE. I seriously can't wait til school starts.
