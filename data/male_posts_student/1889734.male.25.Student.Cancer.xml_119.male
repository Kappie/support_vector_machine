I hope they keep beating them up, since it makes them look silly.  Did WW II end in 1945, or in 1953 when we formally pulled out of the defeated nations?  Does the Left really want to run a campaign based upon splitting hairs like this?  In my wildest dreams, Howard Dean is the nomination.  Go Howie, go!
