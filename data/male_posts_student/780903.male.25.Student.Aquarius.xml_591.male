People who've taken a Civil Procedure class -- or at least people who've taken a civil procedure class and used the same casebook I did -- will recognize this name instantly!  Celotex!  They're not just a made-up company in the casebook -- they actually make something real!  This excited me way too much.  None of my co-workers shared in my excitement.  Please share in my excitement.  P.S. I realize that "At my job today, I encountered some large sheets of foam insulation" might be a sentence no one else in the world has ever used before.  And that it makes my job sound awfully mysterious.  I kind of like that.  P.P.S. Celotex!
