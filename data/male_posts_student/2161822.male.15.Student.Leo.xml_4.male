Maybe I shouldn't have because now I'll become depressed when I visit my site and I see the counter is still at 3. *sigh* At least 3 people visit my site. I love the link I got with the counter. "Flowers" I didn't put that there on my free will I'll have you people know. I would get rid of it but I got a scary threat from the site that provided me the counter that if I altered the link, they would call me names and put a big picture that I stole the counter. Like I have any intention on stealing a free counter.
