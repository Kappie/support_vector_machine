As a young boy I dreamed of finding my own magical blade, hidden somewhere in an enchanted forest, locked away in a ruined castle, or handed down as an heirloom of knightly birth. It's not hard to imagine that I would then in turn fall in love with the legend of Excalibur, the sword of power granted to Arthur Pendragon, better know as King Arthur. Whether the legend deemed he alone could draw it from the great stone, or that it was gifted to him by the Lady of the Lake, the fantasy behind Arthur and his sword, the golden city of Camelot and his noble Knights of the Round Table, was always my favorite tale. It had magic and steel, love and betrayal, chivalry and war, and helped create epic fantasy as we know it today.  Well, if you are like me and love to keep a certain amount of legend and fantasy locked away in the back of your mind, I strongly advise against seeing the new movie "King Arthur". Now don't get me wrong, it had some redeeming elements, and it wasn't the worst film I ever saw. But I have to compare this movie to "First Knight", in that if the film had just changed a few names, say, Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot...yeah, pretty much everyone with a name from the Arthurian legend...well, then it would have been fairly okay on its own.  The makers of this movie try to market it as the "truth" behind the "legend," and I guess in our unfortunate time of reality television, this might sound appealing to a wider audience. Or maybe they thought fans of the legend, like me, would go in hopes of seeing all of the "myths" behind the tale be transformed into believable events. But what they succeeded in creating, in my opinion, was nothing more than a mostly boring story about a handful of "legendary" cavalry, who are sent on one final mission to save some emotionless teenager in order to earn their much-deserved freedom.   There were some aspects of the movie that I enjoyed. I found the fraternal bond between the knights to be fairly convincing, even if they were all the token predictable heroes you've seen before. There's the surly comic-relief guy, the wise scout with his hawk and his curved sword, the big, quiet brute with his axe, the ladies man with his twin short swords, and their noble-til-death, square-jawed leader. Throw in your exotic celtic female archer/love interest, and you've got quite the team. Also, as a good friend of mine pointed out, the filming seems to be mostly organic, save one or two scenes and effects, and therefore most of the visuals are very captivating. The armor and weaponry was very cool, and I must say that I've yet to see a rendition of Excalibur that I didn't want to wield myself. The "Excalibur" that Arthur carries in this film is quite a magnificent sword, and slightly reminds me of Conan's Atlantean blade. The fight choreography was decent most of the time. Also, if there's one thing that they almost always seem to get right in Jerry Bruckheimer films, it is definitely the music. The themes were very epic and triumphant, and I'm considering picking up the soundtrack next time I'm out shopping for tunes.  On the flip side, there were many elements of this film which I could not stomach. First, as stated earlier, this movie would have been better off had there been no insertion of elements from the Arthurian Legend. If the head knight had not been Arthur, his sword not Excalibur, his right hand man not been Lancelot...argh! The inclusion of these things felt forced and unnecessary. The round table didn't need to be there. MERLYN did not need to be there. Also, my apologies to the actors, but the invading Saxons? Wow, were they so not scary. I must have missed the singular moment when their leader was named, because for the entirety of the movie I couldn't see him as anything more than some hairy, half-drunk oaf with an accent that made him sound like he was born in the heart of Texas. And his son, the bald, whiny brooder with the braided chin hair? Boy, what a poor excuse for a military leader. Honestly, I think the two of them led the Saxons simply by walking a little bit further out in front of the rest of the army. And if I had to see one more shot of them just standing around in a field, staring at each other in an "I wish I were menacing" way, I think I might have laughed out loud. The whole "Saxon Invasion" seemed little more than a joke, and I wonder if Arthur and his knights couldn't have taken them all on by themselves in the end. The romance between Arthur and Guienevere felt rushed, and just thrown in to pay some needless tribute to their relationship in the legend. Any sort of passion between Lancelot and Guinevere could have been missed if you blinked more than three times. I think my biggest complaint with the film was the ending. If you don't want it spoiled, I suggest you skip the rest of this paragraph. But seriously...Arthur serves the Roman Empire, which seems to be pretty much in charge of England, right? How then, when he is married to Guinevere in the end in what seemed like a tiny pagan ceremony, does he suddenly become King?  He kills about three hundred dirty, stumbling fools, and so Merlyn, who pretty much um...lives in that one forest over there...can just hand over the whole island?  Did the Romans just up and leave? "Hey Arthur, you swing a mean sword, so we decided to give you all of England." Sorry folks!   If you want to see a mildly entertaining adventure movie with swords in it, go catch this flick, but make sure it's a matinee. If you want to remember the Arthurian legend with a bit more magic to it, I'd steer clear, and snatch up a copy of "Excalibur". Me? I'm suddenly inspired to read "The Once and Future King" again. Now if only I didn't have to reread Martin.....cheers everyone!
