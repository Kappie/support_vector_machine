As I was contemplating human nature, the subject of personality came up, and I began to wonder where the personality originates, what seperates the minds of the  homo sapiens  from lesser organisms? Delving into the development of organic's brains, it is obvious that the divisions in organisms is due mainly to the advances in cognitive capacity.  Homo sapiens  have the greatest recorded cognitive capacity yet, possibly rivaled by dolphins yadda yadda, but the seperation through mental power is also fairly evident in lesser beings. Examining the changes through the processes of cranial evolution, you begin to see that instead of nerve nets and open systems in early or primitive organisms, we advance to nerve junctions, serving as processing centers for more advanced creatures. Moving up the list, there are defaulting occurences of increasing nerve junctions, leading to larger junctions, forming the primitive brain structure, which slowly replaces the nerve junctions as the processing center for the organism. The brain also seems to increase with evolution, as evident of the differences between such examples as  homo habilus  and  homo erectus.  Considering that the advancing brain is the difference between the human species and lower animals, while holding in mind the minor differences in other physical aspects,we isolate the development and continuance of personality as a product of the brain. Now on to my personal considerations.   Considering the source of personality, the brain, and our knowledge of the origin of the brain - nerve junctions and ultimately the basic nerve - we can examine a simple nerve structure in simile of the brain. A nerve functions through simple chemistry, using enzymes and substrates to catalyze a simple equalizing reaction across a nerve membrane, creating the action potential that becomes a nerve impulse, and denotes a recieving of outside information or reaction to said information. A brain is merely a complex web of such nerves, and as such, we determine that the functioning of the brain is embodied by chemistry. Hence, personality is determined by chemistry of the brain.  This raises a few interesting points. Can the personality of a person be changed by adding certain chemical sequences into the nerve net, to create certain changes in the workings of nerves? Modern pharmacutecals point to yes, considering drugs that claim to eliminate depression, or fight ADD. If this is feasible, is it not possible to create adverse effects on the human persona with chemical measures?  On a lesser note, it is worth considering that the personality is most examined during developmental stages. The environment of the developer is often considered the major effector of certain personality traits, but I would proffer another idea. Genetics and heredity could play a prominent role in developing personalities. Considering minute differences in genes affecting the development of the brain, and the massive amount of different genes in the human gene pool, there are a great number of possible combinations that could change the way a person conceives things. The way  I  view something may not mean  you  view it the same way. Environment plays a secondary role changing the person's view of the world after they have inherently been affected by genetics. I have applied arbitrary terms to the way each factor acting on the personality can be viewed, but bear in mind the postulation that my previous quavery conditions are true. Genetic variables I labeled Limiting Factors, because they do not change the way you perceive something, but instead limit the number of ways you can view something. Environmental factors and experiences are loosely labeled Adjusting Factors, because they do not limit the number ofways you  can perceive something,  but rather warp or change the way you percieve something. Without in depth consideration, I've found few other Limiting Factors, althoughI did address the occurence of direct physical injury to the brain, physically limiting it's function and hence possibly affecting personality.  With science advancing by leaps and bounds, we are already able to exert a small amount of control over the human genome, and with time may be able to fully control the genes of our offspring. With our current adequate knowledge of chemistry and the easily controlled factor of environment, what's stopping us from creating any personality that touches our fancy? With an excluded environment,  normal  could truly be skewed when viewed in contrast with traditional values. It raises some interesting considerations for us all.
