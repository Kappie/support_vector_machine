This time around, however, it appears the Bush ticket could steal a little of Kerry's thunder with talk about replacing Cheney's spot on the ticket.  Cheney is seen more and more as a liability rather than an asset, what with Haliburton, Cheney's support for the now disgraced Chalabi, and his overall role in the war in Iraq.  Another consideration is 2008.  Cheney will probably not be a contender to replace Bush and selecting a new runningmate would help insure a contest when Hillary makes her move.  So, who to replace Cheney?  The top choices are probably Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and George Pataki, and in that order.  None of these men are true Republicans, and to choose one of them would signal the end of the Reagan Era of the Republican party.  Nevertheless, their name recognition and, for Pataki and Giuliani, the potential to put NY in play, make them hard to pass up.   urlLink James Gannon  posits that former Sen. John Danforth might be a good choice.  I have no preference.  I like Cheney but think the war on terror can only succeed if Bush stays in office.  I am willing to sacrifice Cheney (and take a squishy Giuliani) if  it means victory in 2004, and perhaps a challenger to Hillary in 2008.  Who could have imagined it; a Texas-New York team would be unstoppable!    As for Cheney, Gannon suggests Bush is too loyal to remove Cheney in a unilateral preemptive strike, so to speak.  Cheney must be willing to give up his position on his own.  Cheney for CIA Director?
