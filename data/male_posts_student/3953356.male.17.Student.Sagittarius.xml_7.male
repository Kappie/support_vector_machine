Well I would like to say in retaleation... Shut up you evil whore! LOL.  Well have not the last few weeks been interesting?  Invasion from the Germans, film festivals all over the place, teachers becoming gangsters and Lauren Greatorex declaring her love for said German (Lukas) and said boy that no one can remember his name (Rob)... (whoops... Tom).  Last night I went with old friends to see the very funny 'Shrek 2'. Doesn't Jennifer Saunder's have an amazing voice! I never knew.  And I would just like to say now... letters are ok through my letter box, hence the name, but books torn in two, two Happy Meal Sonic games and a Tape entitled 'Crush' are a bit extreme. Bloody tards!  Anyway it seems my inspirational writing for one day has come to an end. So from me and myself.  Goodbye!
