That's what it is. In a sense it is new, in a sense it is not. Yes yes, I'm at it again, maybe the tagline for this blog shall be "getting metaphysical on your ass". But anyway, let's get back on track. And is there any track to begin with lol. Sometimes, when I feel lost, I just simply start a new post here, and who knows what I'm gonna write.  Listening to "Fly away" by Liang Jing ru, its amazing though. How I got into chinese pop into the first place. I was a "see ang moh kao". Literally translated as a dead caucasian dog. But anyway, putting it into context is a totally different thing. I just bought her album, the "lian ai de li liang' one. I mean, it was NOT an objective, rational. Ok....I've got 20 bucks, there is this CD then this CD so I'll get this. Nah, its more like, uhhhh, just get this CD, where can I get 20 bucks?  For the first time, I've bought a CD using my heart instead of my head. And really, I did not consider whether there is adequate 'musical fusion' or uhhhh, 'auditory colouration' or maybe have kickass guitar solos. No, what touched me is the sincerity. Her musicians may not be the best around, heck, it has neither musical fusion nor auditory colouration. But yea, music is always best when you can relate to it. She has influenced me alot as a person, I can say, maybe not as a musician. And yea yea corny but it has helped me tide over some difficult periods. And maybe some of you are familiar with these "difficult periods" as I have said.  Its very situational, and the songwriting's relatively good. English pop is mostly crap. American industry money-spinning shit. Yea, the chinese pop world have their own fair share of such people. F4? But there are some people out there who can really make songs which move you.   Love, love, lemme talk about it. Someone once said Love is like a golden shackle in a cushioned birdcage. Uhhhh actually you don't have to figure out exactly who said it, cos' I came up with it lol. Anyway, I have learnt quite a bit (understatement perhaps). I may feel the liberation, the fact that I'm kinda out of the birdcage, but there's one thing I lack, security. The security which I had in the past. The security that there's always someone I can depend on, I can run to when I feel down and out. I'm not saying that its a bad thing, nah, its actually pretty ambivalent if you look at it. What do you want? Freedom or security.  But realizing that there's someone I can run to. But also, my heart's not with me. My heart's not mine, I can't control it, my emotions, sometimes its hard to mask it and it shows. Sure, there's security but I find myself sharing all problems and joys which are not mine. Of course, it is a sacred and wonderful thing, but if applied in the right context.   I don't wish to elaborate more........but as school's starting and my mind starts to work, expect more posts here.   :)
