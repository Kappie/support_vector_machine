Plenty of articles were printed from microfilm! I'll probably go back for their special collections stuff on  Blockade  sometime soon. I have my paper pretty laid out now. I have about 4.5 pages done. Good stuff... the bad news was the 2 hour drive back with a splitting headache. I managed to make it home, take some excedrin and rest until I went to the wrestling banquet. It was cool. Although the video stuff dragged on toward the end.   **
