As this is my first post I guess you aught to know I'm a  urlLink gentoo  advocate. I like the whole idea of having absolute choice. I also like  urlLink gnome  because it has great defaults, allowing most users to jump in. Currently my life is kinda odd. I've been doin' alright at school, but not as good as I want to. This is mainly due to a lack of time, and me spending too much time on the net. Sometimes I'm torn, because I feel that I learn far more of the net than the education system could possibly ever offer, and I get this sense that the world is heading in the wrong direction, but opensource idealogies are slowly fixing it.
