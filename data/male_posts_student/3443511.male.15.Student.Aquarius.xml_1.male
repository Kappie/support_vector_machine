Now, you may not think this is a big deal, but...if you've ever seen someone without their hair brushed for months and then see that persons hair brushed....You will be shocked.  I had my finals in Algebra, Earth Science, and Informaiton Processing III.  I think i passed two of them.  The information processing III test was all on the stuff i didn't pay attention too because it was very boring....and i'm pretty sure i failed it...but the Algebra and Earth Science one.....i think i did fairly well.       I was soooo tempted to put ~You all suck~ and send it to every computer logged onto the server, but i decided not to.  They would trace me down in a second. Only because i got caught once before..  I had the website that the administraters use to do...pretty much everything in that school.  I wrote it on my arm, and a teacher caught me.  I didn't get sunspended or anything (cuz i'm good..lol).  I was pretty much just told to use my powers for good and not evil.  Although this principal i have is a real dick.  The high school principal wasn't bad, but this one....man.  He thinks he's so much smarter than everyone, but he's not and he always loses battles of wits against me and my friends.  It's soo funny to watch him squirm...lol..  Anyways, i don't have to deal with him anymore..seeing as i'm going to be moving down to the high school section next school year.  It's going to be great.  Now, i can actually bring my c.d. player without sneaking it around..     Well, my dad got me the Slipknot c.d. (i had to pay for it, but he went to the store).  The only reason he did this, is because he had time to kill while i was in teen court.  Oh, i got caught with possesion of the marihuana (however you spell it).  But, the sad part is, it wasn't mine.  That's a looong story i don't want to get into.  Anyways, he couldn't get the limited version one, because there wasn't a limited version one at the store.  The c.d. itself was only $16, i just said, kick ass!!!!!  Then, i just came home and caught up on some computer info...      ~The connection between people will always be the same~
