They asked us questions like 'What's the craziest thing you've ever done?' and 'Who would you like to ride wit'?'  I turned the TV on on saturday, and I have to sit through some of the shittiest shit around, like Human Nature, and the most irritating and cute anchor girl, to see myself on TV. Saying 'It involved my next door neighbour, a buffalo, ice cubes, and a golf club,' and 'Mr. Squggle.'  What a waste of time.  Then I saw Britney Spears' video clip for her new single, called something like 'Everytime', a piece of shit if ever I've seen it. She basically goes on about how she hates public attention, and how the public are so unfair.  Newsflash.... YOU ARE IN THE PUBLIC IMAGE!!!!  If you didn't want this, you shouldn't have started. If you can't handle rumours about you, true or false, then don't bitch about it. Shut the fuck up and disappear.  One of those fact things pops up, saying that she 'needed help with geometry and spanish in school'. I'm willing to bet that whatever subject she took, she would need help. Dumb bitch.  I then see Jamie Cullum. I think he won pop idol. The english one. And with good reason. This guy has some good shit. I don't know if he writes his own stuff, but at least he plays the piano, and I saw him on Parkinson doing 'Ain't Misbehaving'. This guy rocks. Buy his album.
