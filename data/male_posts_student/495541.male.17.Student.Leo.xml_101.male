It’s excellent.  :-)  Anyways I’m not doing much of anything because 1) I’m sick and 2) I’m bored.  Put those together and you have me right now.  I can tell the antibiotics are kicking in because I’m feeling a little better.  The only thing is last night I kept waking up about every hour not being able to breathe.  It’s weird.  The medicine seems to affect my tear ducts.  I also had a really weird dream.  I know most weird dreams I have I always seem to forget about 15 minutes after I have them but I remembered this one.  I don’t feel like explaining it thought.  It’s just one of those weird dreams.  Anyways I didn’t update yesterday.  Oh well.  Yesterday sucked anyways.  I don’t feel like talking about that either.  I think I’m going to go play Yahoo pool now.  Maybe I’ll update later today or this weekend.  See ya.  Song of the moment: “Shiver” by Coldplay
