So sad man.. people getting lesser and lesser..  But i cant wait for Uni, after all those shit in NS, i missed schooling a lot, just wan to get back to studying life... Met up with my course-mates a couple of weeks back, had fun crapping with them, cant wait to go to school and crap with them everyday, and release some stress from studies.  School, i cant wait!   Current Mood: Craving for school Current Music: None
