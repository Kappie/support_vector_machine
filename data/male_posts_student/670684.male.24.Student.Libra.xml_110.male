Most likely because the only other funny email joke I ever got involved Mr. Rogers in a sexual tryst with King Friday and the other characters of the Land of Make-Believe.  Though it could be that I referenced this joke yesterday?    My spot in the CRC computer lab looks directly at a women's restroom with two urinals and a traditional toilet.    The TA in my Digital Doc class, Ted Gesing, is showing his documentary short film  urlLink Nutria  at  urlLink South by Southwest , a crazy phantasmagoria of short film, live music, and performance art.  Performance art.  Nothing beats the art show I went to in Chicago, which included two hours of experimental film where I got to sit inside a bubble room reminiscent of  urlLink E.T. , and also watched live as a woman stood inside of a big yellow bouncy ball and jumped around to celebrate being 40.    The most exciting thing I've done this week (except stay up past 3 am every night):  buying  urlLink A History of God ,  Steppenwolf , and  urlLink Introducing Eastern Philosophy  at  urlLink Half Price Books  yesterday.  The causes of my recent sexual drought are becoming more evident.
