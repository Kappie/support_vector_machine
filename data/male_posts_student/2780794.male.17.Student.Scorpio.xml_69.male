Cheryl Fox have reported that SP floorball players are anxious and restless waiting for the results of the naming of the IVP Squad which is rumoured to be released this week. An interview with Evangelista Toricco failed to give much light to the rumour as he only said that "The IVP squad names will be released soon. I urge all players to still continue training hard for the coming trainings and friendlies to cement your places in the squad. Thank you" Another interview to a senior player rumoured to be part of the TOP SECRET IVP COMMITTEE also does not give much insight to the rumour. "I have said repeatedly to the players that what is important is your performance in every training and friendly. The selection of players and the time it will be released will be left to the committee's discretion. Thank you."  Is it true? Stay tuned to find out...
