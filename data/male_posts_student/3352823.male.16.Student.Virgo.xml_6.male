When I say "bit of" I mean they just say "There's a storm coming yadda yadda yadda" and that's the end of that. But for today's storm there was a lot of coverage of it on FOX... I was trying to was On-Air, but they just kept on interrupting. At one point, there was a clash of thunder that sounded just like a bomb.  I decided to get some pictures of this "rare" occasion (not, we get them all summer). But there was a lot of rain, so I snapped the pictures! These are hot off the wire! Rock on.    urlLink    My finger pointing to the now open heavens. urlLink      urlLink    The rain bouncing off le tarmac. (French... I think) urlLink
