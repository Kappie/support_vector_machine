I had some choices in mind: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Gentoo Linux, Fedora Linux, SuSE Linux, and Slackware Linux.  After I read a recent review on Slackware 10.0 I decided that's what i'm going to use. I chose Linux over *BSD because it's more widely supported. An application usually is developed for Linux first and then ported to run on *BSDs. Everything is updated more frequent on the Linux platform anyway.  I've tried to install Gentoo Linux before but tripped with several times of failure during installation. I'm doing full custom install which download every individual application off the internet, config, and install them one at a time. Many times it fails somewhere along the line so I'm quite disturbed by that fact.  I first started out with Linux on Slackware back in 1995. I've used many various Linux distributions and found Slackware to be the most straight to the point, no BS, no bloatware Linux distribution. Though I haven't touch Slackware Linux in several years but it seems to me that basic underlaying concept is still the same from before so I decided to take the plunge and try it out! Wish me luck!
