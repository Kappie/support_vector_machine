I was able to(in my eyes) re-establish a friendship that had been corrupted in invisible ways by my own hands, dance with some of the greatest women ever all in a small room, have the most polar relationship ever, and kiss Giboc.  I've heard people say that your views of someone can change amazingly fast, but I'd never been witness to this until very recently. Immense polarization is wonderful, and it seems to happen in our relationship and internally as well.  And also, thanks to some important revisions, I can now finally have totally candid, honest, and helpful talks with one of the most intelligent and caring people I know.   The friendship was with Jonathan, the polar relationship was with Claudia, and the kiss was with Giboc. Of course, I had already said that last part in the original post. Yeah, I had been pissed at Claudia around this time I believe. Guess that didn't last.
