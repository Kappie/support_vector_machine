Each of our souls intertwine, when we do.  Instantly we see it the time to grow and be it when everything is pinned on a hope.  Let rise the dreams of your heart, that innocent youth careless and kind.  Free to roam the breeze in love only when two brilliantly shine as one...   Boat Song Lyrics:  Wishing on a dream that seems far off Hoping it will come today.  Into the starlit night, Foolish dreamers turn their gaze, Waiting on a shooting star.  But, what if that star is not to come? Will their dreams fade to nothing? When the horizon darkens most, We all need to believe there is hope.  Is an angel watching closely over me? Can there be a guiding light I've yet to see? I know my heart should guide me, but, There's a hole within my soul.  What will fill this emptiness inside of me? Am I to be satisfied without knowing?  I wish then for a chance to see, Now all I need,   Is my star to come...
