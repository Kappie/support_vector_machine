On Monday, March 19, I discovered that my computer became terribly screwed up. Ads started appearing here and there, and I have a corrupted file, preventing me from accessing a hell lot of my programs. I can't even go to Messenger and IE keeps closing down on me. That's why I didn't blog. IE could shut down on me any second.   Guess what? I got Windows XP. HaHa! Uncle Steven came to fix for me (on the Sunday when Miss Congenality was showing. Such a nice show!). He couldn't fix the problem, so he suggested cleaning up the hard drive. Oh well. He also suggested a change of OS, so I wanted XP. Yep. Here I am, using XP! Weee! Even XP cats are meowing at the new Operating System. This computer is so darn empty. I must fill it up with my files (I saved my files on CD-Rs). Yes. I am now downloading MSN Messenger. So slow, the download! Ayioh!!  Well well well. A whole lotsa things happened. Hmmm. Let me start with the academic aspect first.   Hmmm. What can I say? These days are pretty hectic. Yep. I got my time-table le. Hmm. The odd-days are good, because we are let off early. The even-days are long. Yep. I have to attend make-up lectures (I think tomorrow's Chem lecture is the last make-up lecture), so I am returning late these days. On Mondays, I got Choir till 7:30. I will be discussing my views on the different subjects later. Anyhoo, because I can't go online, two adverse (okay, not really adverse. Only one is.) effects happened. One, I have lotsa time to do my homework. Heh. Now, my Chinese homework is in front of me and I don't even have the heart to do it. Two, I've lost touch with the music world. Seriously. I haven't been listening to the radio!! I don't know what new songs there are! Oh my! I must recover from the 'disconnection'!  Hmmm. Lemme talk about GP first. Well, it is/was (can't decide which) my favorite subject. Mr Jeremy (an ABC) is our tutor. Well, he's effeminate. Yeah. HaHa. I don't care about that de la. He too soft, easily bullied. Hmm. I got into a GP group, SU(Slackers United). Okay. Whatever la. I have a neutral view on GP, as of now.  Okay. Moving onto Chinese. Well, we got this Mr Yeo (Yang Lao Shi). Hmmm. He's okay. He has high expectations of us though, seeing that our class is the 'best'. Yeah. S22 was split up into 3 Chinese classes (I think Gabriel and JiaHao switched places. JH was supposed to go into our class, and Gabriel into the "weaker" class. Gabriel got around D7-C5 for Chinese... Ayiah, JH came into our class anyway.). The As went into my class lor. Hmmm. Sometimes, Mr Yeo is quite funny, but sometimes, he is not. He really expects high standards from us. Ergh. My Chinese is not that good. It is just luck that I got an A. Sheesh. Ayiah, Chinese class is meowing.  Okie. Chem next. Well, I am kinda struggling. Well, not really. I am just currently struggling with Redox. It's very complicated, and worse off, it is the foundation of many topics. Sigh. Well, we got this really good Practical teacher, Mrs Jasima. Our Tutorial tutor is a complete opposite of Mrs Jasima. Boy, does she really has a short fuse. She even said so herself. She said "I am not here to become a celebrity and make friends. This is my job, this is my career and I am here to teach!". Oh my.   Okay. Physics. Hmm. Physics was okay. I mean, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would. I understand Kinematics and can apply the 4 equations. Yep. Our Tutor is Miss Yee. Hmm. She has a very soft voice, so she uses microphone to speak all the time. She's kinda weak though, I mean, as in can be bullied quite easily. She doesn't raise her voice with us. Hmm. Physics was okay for me.  Maths C. HaHa. Our tutor is Mr Tham, who is also our form teacher. He hor, don't know how to say him la. He's a bit crazy. "This rascal minus this rascal gives you this rascal here....okay, jokes aside" -.-" He's a good CT though. He calls me "the small K"...O.O What a meowing meow meow.   Propject Work. Yep. We are gonna do PW for our first-year. Hmmm. I got into the same group as Kelvin (groups arranged by Tham Tham. he commented "2Ks! Luck of the draw!"). Hmm. I am also with GekLing (our class manager, or monitoress), FengXiang (I keep mistakenly calling her Xiang Fei. Too much HZGG! HaHa! Speaking of HZGG, CQ informs me that we still need to see a lot more episodes before Huang Ah Ma comes to fetch them back! Haiyoh...!!) and WeeTiong. Hmmm. I like my group. Good good. I am a bit worried about our topic, after seeing the sample proposal forms presented in lecture today. Hmm. See how the meeting tomorrow goes.   Haiz. What else haven't I covered? I think that's all for the academic side. Now, I shall move on.  Hmmm. I really felt myself changing (in thoughts) as the time passes by. Like, a new me emerges lor. Hmm. I shan't reveal too much. Yeah. I am so itching to tell Manda and Wendy. Maybe I'll sms them later. Hmmm. (Haiyoh...my Chinese homework is still staring at me from the table. I only completed 2 questions, 3 more to go. Sigh! Never mind, hand up on Friday. Can do tomorrow!)  Not being able to come online at all (okay, not at all. My brother only allows me to use for meagre amounts of time, for he has Counter-Strike to play...sigh), I really miss chatting with mah friends. Wendy. Amanda. CQ. XC. Yeah. You say how!!  Well, not that me and CQ are so anti-social that we didn't hang out with other cats. We hang out with Yih Fei, Jeric and JunSheng. Most of the break times, me and CQ will always go alone anyway. Okay, we are kinda anti-social. :P Hmmm....  Hmm. What else to write? I don't think there's anything more I would like to add, except that I have to complete my Chinese homework real soon. Heh. The worry-wort. Okay. Gotta go sleep now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
