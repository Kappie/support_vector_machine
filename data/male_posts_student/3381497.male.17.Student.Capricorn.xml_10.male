(doesn't necessarily mean I would) This isn't here to promote him, but just to show someone besides Bush and Kerry. Remember, when you vote, don't go with what everyone else is going with, think for yourself, look things up, know what's up, don't just vote with ignorant eyes, try to see the ball through every possible side(note: balls have no real sides).
