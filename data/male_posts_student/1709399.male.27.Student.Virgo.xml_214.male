The First lecture was given by Bharatanatyam exponent Leela Samson. Last week the second lecture was delivered by Sandipan Deb ( Managing Editor , Outlook ) and the author of the Recent Book " IITans " (Sandipan is an Alumnus of IIT - Kgp  IIM - C ) .The Lecture was laced with self-deprecating humor and candor . He gave numerous examples of India Shining at the Research Institutions ( IISc,TIFR,IIT-M,IIT-Mum) . He was of the opinion that unless the Research facilities in premium institutes and rural entrepreneurship/education is encouraged , we still might miss the superpower bus . He spoke with a lot of affection about Prof.Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT- Madras , who is pioneering technology to the masses.
