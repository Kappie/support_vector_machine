But after a while, I began to have some thoughts about it.  If a bad person did not know both good and evil, on what basis is he a bad person at all, since he wouldn't know that what he was doing was wrong in the first place. And in fact this would lead to a good person having the ability to do evil, a greater ability than the 'bad' person's capacity to do something wrong. Furthermore, it is also very untrue to say that, even if we said that we were judging the person on the basis of an external 'law' (in other words, not the person's knowledge of good and evil but someone else's), since if this is a 'good' person can equally be 'good' even though he does not know both good and evil. Thus, the statement is not true, since a 'good' person need or need not know both good and evil, as with the 'bad' person as well.  According to God, a good person needs to know both good and evil, and at the same time for a bad person as well, since it is only when a choice is given that a person can be bad or good based on the choice he made. So, a person is judged not by what he does, but what he has chosen to do. For example, we do not say that this waiter is good because he has served the food to my table, because he was only doing what he should, especially since he is obliged to do so as part of his job. Thus, a person is only as good as his intention.  So what do we say of a person who knows not both good and evil? We say that this person does not have a choice, in other words, no free will. The person is made to do both good and evil without his own intention to do either. (note: this is on the basis that everything is either good or evil, and there is no neutral, thus, only absolutes. Otherwise, you cannot only look at it as a person has no free will concerning doing good and evil)But, we must know that it is hard to come by a person that know neither both good and evil. Because according to God, the Law and conscience as well has made this knowledge available to all humans. And at the same time, it is said that all humans have free will.  This brings us to another question. How about the person who knows only good or evil? I would see that a person who knows only what is good, has no free will since he is made to believe that everything he does is good, since he knows only good. It is the same for a person who knows only evil. For if he knows that whatever he does is wrong and is unable to do anything about it, he has no free will. (This is beyond our imagination. Try to imagine a person feeling bad about the evil he does, but he can only do evil. It is great torture.)  We can also see it as an impossible mode, since, if a person had free will, it would mean that he has a given choice, and thus, he knows the opposite of what he first knows. Which means he knows both good and evil.  The very basis of my argument here is that there is a common absolute moral standard which we all accept. This would mean a higher being or Law. In other words, on the basis that there is God.  To my brothers and sisters in Christ, please be aware that God decides what is good and evil. In the sense that obedience and likeness to Him is good, and disobedience to Him is evil. God is good, not beacuse He is judged and is good. But rather, He is good because He made Himself the absolute model of good. In other words, it is important to note that 'good' is 'likeness to God', instead of God being judged and declared good.
