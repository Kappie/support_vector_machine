It'll be nice to be together again and I can't wait to explore the city - just the three of us. And I'm excited that I'll be able to use my cell and take advantage of my mobile to mobile and free long distance again. Yay!   Happy 22nd Birthday Desiree! I hear you'll be enjoying the Jersey shores this year. Have a beautiful day...and blog about it. Hee!   Edit: Greetings from HOTlanta - whew! It was 88 degrees when we arrived after sunset. More on our new surroundings once we get a chance to get out for some exploration. This part of town reminds alot of Hazleton Lanes along Avenue Rd. area in Toronto.
