I got to work, called Aliant to find out what was going on and low and behold, they'd fixed all my phone bill problems! That's a big woo hoo! Then some good stuff happened here at work regarding some bad stuff that had gone on last week. I wasn't directly involved, but part of my job was. But they got it all fixed. I got some major praise from my boss on a letter regarding a union raise, which I luckily get. But on top of that letter, was a little note from some anonymous person, which read "Thank you for being so helpful and patient with my computer problems. You show so much more patience than some of your fellow staff members." I felt really good that people appreciate that I try to be friendly with everyone and as patient as possible. The day whiddled on and I got some work done, working with Scott most of the morning and some of the afternoon. When 4:30 rolled around, I was quite pumped and excited. Scott and I rolled out, to head to the 'pop shop' to grab some beverages for the small trip we were going on this weekend.  On arrival in the parking lot, Scott's cell rang, with Sue telling Scott to tell me to call home asap. That's when I found out my Grandmother Cameron had passed away peacefully in her sleep. She had been running a temperature of 38 degrees or more most all of last Friday. My parents had been called up to sit with her at 5am that day. So my 'high' came to a crashing end. We had had plans to do a lot of stuff on the weekend and I was unsure of what to do. My parents only had a minute to talk, because they had appointments to keep. So I was left sitting on the outside looking in for the next 2 hours while I awaited their return home.Scott, Sue and I, along with some other friends, had plans to see a musical performance that night, called Good Vibrations, and I really wanted to go to meet a few of the other people (all girls, of only one which I was interested in meeting). So when my parents and I talked, we decided that I would not go home for the funeral. And after talking some more, my Mom broke down. And much to my chagrin, I had to break down and tell her that since my plans for B10 had fallen through, that I was coming home on August 2nd. That cheered her up very much and made my night. So off to the performance I went, met some new friends and enjoyed the 3 hours of live folk music covers!  Saturday, Scott, Sue and I were up and away for the fireworks display in the Crows Nest Pass called "Thunder in the Valley", which is in the valley of the mountains. Along on our trip, was Amanada, who had been out with us the night before and going to see the fireworks with Susan and friends from work. We had an interesting day, enjoyed the fireworks and had a really great time. I was totally doing my own personal celebration of my Grandmother's life, totally enhaling liquor like it was going out of style. I apparently was described as a cute cuddly bear, a total riot, and that crazy guy from down East. I'm glad I kept everyone quite amused and that only Scott, Sue and Katherine (Sue's friend from work, who's parents house we were all staying) knew that I was kinda in the dumps. I had a great time and enjoyed myself, even if someengaged beaver somehow found it's way out that night. I had mentioned to a couple of other people that night what had happened, but only the people who I knew a bit better and was comfortable talking to, like Katherine's bf, Lucas and Amanda, who was quickly becoming a friend. She's from 'down East' too and was a nice reminder of home for me.  Sunday we came back, I talked to my parents several times throughout the day about the wake and how things went. It's suprising that close to 300 people went to an old woman's wake. My parents were so happy to see friends, family and people come to give their condolances for an 'old woman' that people had probably forgotten about.  Monday, I took a bereavement day and waited patiently by the phone (as in I slept) until my mother called to let me know that the funeral had gone ok and that the Minister and a family friend had done a beautiful job with the service and the eulogy respectively.  Today, I'm back to work, and things are starting to sink in. I've always been the 'rock' in my family. The one who can bottle it all up, until after everyone is ok and things are settled. Then I have my break down. I'm sure in the next day or two, it will come at some inopportune time and I'll feel like a jackass. Only management and my co-workers know what happened.  But on a perky note, I'm feeling much better now that I've spammed you all with lots of useless crap, that most of you will have known or not and that it's all off of my chest. So I will be blogging again soon, but until then,  Tune in next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!
