OMG, i was like in shock, my shaver!! Its really unhygenic to share a shaver, and i dont know how many times my grandma had used my shaver without my notice, and i had been sharing with her..       Why like that? My dad also used my shaver a couple of years back, i practically kpkb to my mum, and my dad bought his own shaver.. Now?? My GRANDMA!!!!!! OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG IM GOING NUTSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!      Guess i better buy a newshaver and lock it in my drawer, im still tinking about how long my grandma had been using my shaver... EEEEKKKKKK      Had to go out with astubble on my chin, no choice! Met up my SIM course-mates, quite a fun bunch, but the big topic we were discussing, whetherour acceptance into the SIM course by UOL is confirmed.... Some of my course-mates received a letter rejecting them, OH MAN, im scared now! I havent received any letter yet coz i submitted my application quite late... *FINGERS CROSSED*       Current Mood: EEK     Current Music: Maroon 5 - This Love
