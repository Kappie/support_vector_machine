But my hunch about it was wrong. He was a seminarian who just got out a few months ago from the seminary. My first impression about him is pretty cool. Maybe because he's young and he has lots of ideas for the class to learn and to apprecciate art, like going to the museums, listening to the classical music and watching movies with sense. He said that this was his first time to teach humanities since his major is philosophy and he'll be teaching for the very first time a coed class because he got used to teach younger boys inside the seminary.  Today, in my calculus class, the department changed the professor. I don't have the guts to ask them why. But the one who took place of the female professor (a male professor) seems to be nice because he had students before who eventually became my classmates.  Oh well, I do need to go home because I'm so hungry. Good thing that my class is over, not like my schedule yesterday. I had a  four and a half hour break (1:30pm - 6:00pm) and go home at 7:30pm. Ciao!
