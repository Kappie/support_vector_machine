The answer to that question would be because without it school would continue on forever. Think about it, if there were never a last day of school then theoretically school would continue on without ever stopping. Now most us you would agree with me and say that whatever government department comes up with such a notion deserves to be burned down and have their ashes nuked. But for those who find never ending school a miracle then you deserve to be locked in the same government department while it is being burned and later nuked. But is this the correct answer? I am endeavoring to find the meaning of the last day, like those who endeavor to find the meaning of life…without much luck. 	The last day of school has many different perspectives depending on what school you are from. If your from say Killara where the students pretty much rule the school then the last day of school means one word “CHATSWOOD”. If your from my school where the school rules the school then it means “turn up if you want, we can accept the fact that you don’t want to come to this moneyless hole, but remember this is only one of four days in which you can do so”. If you’re from NSG where the school  rules the school with an iron fist then it means “turn up or DIE”. So from this I have gathered that if you go to NSG then there is no such thing as the last day of school effectively meaning that school will never finish for you. To this I can only say it’s your own fault for having enough money to be able to pay your teachers enough to work every day of the school term. 	My last day of school went something along the lines of this: 1st period- listen to one 5 minute English speech, invade a Yr 9 classroom so we could watch their movie and eat their chocolate. 2nd period- go online and play computer games.  3rd period- shock horror, I actually have to use a pen. Wrote half a page of notes, munched chocolate, talked about pop culture. (I notice I’ve had a lot of chocolate by now) 4th period- run between jap room and computer room to copy files for presentation. Sneak out halfway through due to lack of interest in subject. Should probably mention that the teacher was watching while I walked out for an early lunch. 5th period – played table tennis. Decided to leave at 2:30. Unfortunately there was no bus so I went back to school to watch basketball. 6th period – watched basketball. Felt depressed due to lack of happy happy endorphins. 	As you can see I would have been much better off staying at home that day. Last year on another last day, I was walking to school with the Su’s (for those of you who don’t know who they are they are extremely smart twins who dress the same. Most of us consider them to be one person instead of two hence the collective term “The Su”) and we were discussing the last day. Through this discussion I mentioned how the last day should be cancelled. The Su pointed out that doing so would just create another last day and if you continue canceling last days then a school term practically won’t exist. I said something like “So?” to which the Su replied with a withering glare. During this conversation I mentioned my plan for education in the future. I won’t tell you it here, but it involves brain transplants, microchips and one or possibly several very large computers. Basically it eliminates the need to go to school at all and it was my answer to the lack of existence of a school term.  	So from this I have concluded that the meaning of the last day is…I have absolutely no idea at all. Although, I have managed to find the reason for its existence, I somehow think that this is not the entire meaning. It’s like one piece of a 3D jigsaw puzzle recommended for people over 25.  So to recap I don’t know the meaning of the last day, but if you do feel free to tell me anytime.
