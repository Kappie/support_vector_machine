He molested me allll night, and he really disturbed me. Then we played vids. It was a game called Red Dead Revolver, by Rockstar Games. To tell you the truth, it was pretty good. But I think it has WAY tomany AI enemy glitches, especially with when you ad that to 2 of them trying to get through one door at the same freakin time. Oh, it was funny. Fuckin shot them in the face, little fat beanerz, heh heh heh. ANYWAYS! If you think I'm a little violent...?... WELL THEN FUCK YOU! Unless I know you and your my friend then... I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK! Heh heh heh... Hmmm... Damn ADD screwin me off the point here!!! Lol! AUUUUUuuuwwww... Ok, I'm good now. Now, Jonny spent the night, he molested me, we played vids, and we got on the computer... that was about it for last night.... This morning me and Jonny woke up, because my mom was listening to the fuckin TV to loud! AND IT WAS THE GODDAMNED ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW!!! An episode I had all ready seen of coarse. Now, I tried to go back to sleep but by then the ADHD had already kicked in and I was running wround the house in boxers, and talking to my mum like a three year old. THATS ME! LOVE ME! Heh heh heh. I am a very demanding person, you have to learn to love that about me if your gunna fuckin read this, of coarse I didn't have to add the "fuckin" but that another thing you have to learn to love about me if your gunna be reading this, unexpected moments of sarcastic rage. BOO YA! Lol. Now I just gone and forgot what I was talking about! Oh yea! Now I was running around in my boxers. Then I setttled down. Lol. Now I tried to arrange away for me and my girl friend Amanda to see eachother, but it got really complicated. I dont want to get into the details of the plan but, I spent the day over at her house watching movies with Amanda, Jonny, and Jonny's girl friend, Kat. We watched Me Myself and Irene. I watched it earlier at my house BUT NOT THE DVD! Which we saw of... Anyways, the movie was a funny. and at the end of the movie,suring the credits, me and Amanda kissed. To tell you the truth, I have kissed someone, BESIDES MY MUM, before and I didnt feel that spark that most people say when they say that it was a true love kiss. I never felt my breathe taken away the first time, but I geuss I was saving up for a second love. I swear time stoped. My breathe felt like it just seeped out of my pours. And my sight when blured. I knew right away what the kinda kiss for true love felt like. Better than ice cream. Way better than anything. I LOVE YOU AMANDA! I really do hope it lasts. Right now I am just sitting here typing about all that happened today and listening to korn on my sisters boombox, but with headphones on. Which I should mention, THESE HEADPHONES SUCK CAMEL ASS!!! All fuckin scratchy and what not... uhg... BUT IM TALKING TO AMANDA! Which reminds me, I think she deserves my FULL attention so, Bye for now ya'll peeps, ~  For A Broken Winged Mocking Bird
