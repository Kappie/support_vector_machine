Neway, today's chinese oral was smooth sailing though I burpped quite a few times bfore I took the exam. But all went well in that i manage to read the passage and answer all the questions asked by the teacher without much trouble. So I can say it is a good sign though I may not know if I passed with flying colours or not. But never mind, a pass is better then a fail. Hm.... Dunno wat else to say and so I shall hold my pen till tomorrow.!!
