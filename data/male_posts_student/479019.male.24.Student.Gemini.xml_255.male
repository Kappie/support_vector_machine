We talked about a variety of stuff... but the most interesting thing was that there's a swat priest in every Catholic diocese in case of the need for exorcism. That's pretty bad ass.  Imagine a priest calling for back up due to demonic possession and getting the baddest mofo of a priest bursting through the door.  "I'm here to chew bubble gum, and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubble gum."  **
