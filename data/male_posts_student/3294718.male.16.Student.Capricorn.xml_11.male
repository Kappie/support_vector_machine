The first and only time I'd seen him before, he was walking out of Franklin while we waited in front of it for tennis. I was stunned to see him, then about five seconds later we watched as a squirrel got scared and changed trajectories in mid-air, a move out of "The Matrix." It was all too much to be a coincidence. I also remember jumping up to that tree and going for a pull-up only to see Willie in the window shaking his head at me.  Everybody's working for the weekend. Or at least I am, a nice 17 1/2 hours of it... I'd prefer the Halo-fest not be Saturday or Sunday. This is gonna be a good summer - I'ma work hard, I'ma play hard.  I'm 18 points in Chemistry away from pulling off another succession in a chain of straight A honor rolls as far back as recorded history of my life stretches, and it should be easily attainable given the 40-point-ness of the final.
