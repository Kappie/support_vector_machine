Though I'll be thinking about that moment all through my day, I know I've got a lot to do to get to that point.  First of all, I have basketball in the morning.  If you ask me, that's probably the worst thing in the world to have right before the last day of finals.  That's really crazy because that time should be spent for sleeping and for getting ready for finals!  I guess they didn't think about that when making the schedule for basketball!  Anyways I've got my World History final, my Language Arts presentation, and my Geometry final.  After that, I have to go in to make up for being sick to Computer Graphics.  I need to turn in my animation video.  Also, I have to stay after to make up my Geometry tests and quizzes that I would have made up the days I was sick.  I hope that I can get those done before I have basketball at 2:30 (really 3 but they say 2:30 anyways.. those bastards!).  I don't know -- but we'll see!  Anyways I should be getting to bed!  Good night.
