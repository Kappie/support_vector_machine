Had been studying and mugging hard for 5 tests due today... well actually it was only 2, but it snowballed when I bought some time on Thursday last week and skipped 3... so yeah... Final schedule is that, today had my Social Studies test and Maths test after school, Chinese test pushed till tomorrow, and Chemistry scrapped (other tests percantage higher), and Physics date of retest yet to be confirmed.... What a handful of info.. haha..  So, yesterday was kinda occupied, even wanna go to CTP to settle a incident that happened also no time... just stayed home and thats it.   Well, off to today...  Okay day, perhaps. Everything went smooth, and the coolness of the morning shower lasted until around 11 am.. loved the little water droplets hitting the leaf... makes such a nice scene, and a crisp sharp sound.. *piak* hehe...  Sherman didnt come today, everyone gets sick once in a while.... so hes not excluded. But the MIA IT rep sure made a statement : without him, its gonna be messed up trying to set up the Mac and the projector. Haha. Gonna pressure him to give me back my $50... dammit, he says end of July, now its August ! Pay up ! *lol*  So I went home after my maths retest, kinda found it quite ok to handle. Only didnt know how to handle 2 sub-questions.. the rest were ok.  Tomorrow's my NAPFA 2.4 km run, yeah, and that kinda concludes today...  Now I'm off to bed to get some much needed sleep, yesterday had insomnia and extra use of my eyes... studying the stacks and stacks of notes... *yawn* Nearly fell asleep while having my hair cut today.... (>.  Ja !
