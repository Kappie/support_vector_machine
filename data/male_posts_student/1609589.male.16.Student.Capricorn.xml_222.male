It's because the stupid-shit production decided they needed our lock-in room for a greenroom, so we have to wait!  I kept saying to myself, "Just finish this project, work REALLY hard on it, because you're gonna have a kickass lockin on saturday which will RULE!!", but i guess I can't fucking say that anymore.  Why the fuck do they need more room for makeup? They already have the entire FUCKING CHURCH!!! AAHHHHHH!!!!!!  I'm too fucking pissed to type right now. My hands are shaking too much with anger.
