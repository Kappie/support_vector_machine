Aware that drinking on an empty stomach isn't such a hot idea, I stayed dry most of the night until we decided to finish off with a round of scotch on the rocks. However, we got a lot more scotch in our glasses than we had been expecting  I was soon plastered. 
  
While I was there, I realized that it wasn't as much fun being at a pub with these people as it had been when I would go to pubs with my friends in Waterloo. Those were more relaxed  friendly experiences. This time I was a bit on edge the whole time, even when I could no longer have walked in a straight line. I guess it could be because I don't know the other interns well enough yet.
