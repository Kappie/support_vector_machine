I only have like 1 that we could watch. If we haven't seen them, or they are new, just bring em right over. You guys can prolly come over anytime after 11:00 AM. On Saturday you guys can stay as long as you want. If ya wanna bring anything else, you can. I'm so sorry we don't have a pool or anything. :( . Call me if you want to know anything! Brittany, I got your message. I'm so glad your coming!! Oh! and bring your pictures if you have them from Orlando. I'm thinkin we should all take turns and just tell all of our stories without any interruptions. How does that sound? Love, Rarch
