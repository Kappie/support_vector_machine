Adoption can be much better in the long run for the baby and the mother.  Many women who have had abortions say they wish they hadn't.  Abortion is not something you can take back.  Before women choose to have an abortion they should realize and understand its effects on their body.  However, this is America, one of the few places on Earth were people can live freely.  Therefore to deny a person the right to choose what to do with her own body goes against what we as Americans stand for. One issue that really itches me is what role should fathers play in abortion?  In reality it took an man and a woman to make the baby, but the baby only grows inside the woman.  Is abortion a woman's struggle?  Just curious.
