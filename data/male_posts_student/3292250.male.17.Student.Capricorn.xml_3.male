Granted I've got the SAT to take June 5th, but I'm not all that worried about it. Mom is freaking out enough for me though.  In these last couple weeks, the school finally realized how to properly block web sites from students, so now I can't get to Yahoo! Games, or my friend Joe's journal (granted he needs to go to Blogger), or even the AIM Express service. At least I can still get my e-mail and access Blogger and the other weblogs I read.  So, It's the middle of 3rd period now (no TV show today), and I'm sitting in front of a Windows 98 box passing the time. Why I'm even here today is beyond me; at least I got to sleep in until 7. In English today we got our grades for our papers, our presentation, and the class. I'm happy to report my percentages as 99% for the paper (we talk about them with Ms. Dollison tomorrow), 94% for the presentation, and 94% for the class. So as long as I do well on the final exam I'll have an A in English. Stupid 93%-is-the-lowest-A scale. If this disctrict followed the college (and normal in my opinion) scale I would have an A in allmost every class, and even then I would have a B to show for my 82%-ish grades that will show up as a C on my records. But enough of my complaining.
