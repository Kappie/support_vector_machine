But I don't know if I should try to let him buy it himself, so I can buy Yoshi's Island for GBA instead ;)... It's just soo fun! I really need a good and fun sports game for my Gamecube now I think... So it's a really hard decision... but i htink he is into buying even if we don't share the price...  I will come with some marks for a game if I get a new one.
