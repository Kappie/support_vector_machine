Then, as most of you know, I went to the staff weekend.  IT was cool.  I did a little work, saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in a while, and had fun.  It is always good to be able to go back to Ransburg.  I can't wait till summer starts.  I want to go back to camp so much.  I have one and a half weeks left of school.  It will be awesome when school is finally over.  Then I will be a senior and have only one year left.  Stephen's Eagle Court of Honor is tomorrow, and Will and I are doing basically the whole ceremony.  It should be pretty sweet.  So now all of the Crayner's have reached the rank of Eagle, that is pretty cool.  Now all that Stephen has to do is get all of the merit badges, and he is really close.  He has 90 and only needs 30 more.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya!
