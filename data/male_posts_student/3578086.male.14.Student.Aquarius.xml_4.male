I mean there are people i fancy but i know i cant have now that is a feeling and a half.I mean with louis i loved him soo much and i knew i couldnt have him which hurt me so badly. And it is most likly to happen again. when he found out i just wanted to shout out "I CANT CONTROL WHO I FALL IN LOVE WITH!!!!". Also why is no one else gay in dulwich at my age i mean i cant be the only person who is!!! I hate being the only gay person (for now ((and for a while anyway))) cos u end up being alone all the time (with relasionships)  and also no straight person cna understand what you are talking about so they act the only way they know and laugh! I mean FUCK THEM i am going to become a Hetrophobe! I HATE STAIGHT PEOPLE!!!!
