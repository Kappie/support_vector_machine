"hey...linden just called an said you have a show in fifteen." "uh...you better mean hours, because see, i'm babysitting. i have a show tomorrow night." "no...i wrote down the dates wrong...there is no show tomorrow" "WHAT?!?!" "yeah, sorry. but she said your opposite is there and she can do it if you can't make it." "WHAT?!?!" "if you want ben can come over here and i'll watch him and mom can drive you to the show...you'll probably be a little late, but at least-" "I CAN'T BE LATE!!!" "well call linden and-"  then i hung up and called linden. who didn't answer. so i called andrea. i managed to calm myself down enough to sound not panicky i think...anyway, it kinda got worked out. but i hate failing expectations. anyway, on with the story. the rest of this emotion crap is in my journal, which you'll never read. ha ha.   sorry if you were affected by my father's and my own mistake. believe me, i feel terrible. it was like that one time when nora didn't tell me when call was for the play and i was on makeup crew, and she said she'd call me and tell me, and then she didn't, and i was and hour late for call. except this was worse because i acctually wanted to be there, unlike when i was on makeup crew. and this was worse because i was acctually semi-important, also unlike when i was on makeup crew. anyway, i feel like i failed all of you. 'specially tay, since it's like his show, and i wasn't there.   so then i didn't feel like watching a comedy movie. i went upstairs and paced, working through what i would say to ben's mom.  "hey, how much are you paying me nowadays?" "[i have no idea how much she gives me] an hour. why?" "well...yesterday you only paid me 3.50 an hour..." "I am so terribly sorry! let me add hundreds of dollars onto your pay!" was how i thought it would go.  mrs. lestak came home. after tucking ben in, i went upstairs. i said exactly what i had practiced, except i was really super nervous and my voice was shaking. it was alot like that time when i went to apologize to mr. keller because i was late to enchantment or something, and the whole day i felt absolutly terrible, and my stomache hurt because i felt like such a failure, so during outdoor ed i went in and talked to him, and i almost started crying. except this was a little less stressful. so i said my "how much are you paying me an hour?" and she said "5.50...is that ok?" and i said "oh yeah that's fine...just..." and now i got all shaky and my voice got caught in my throat and all..."yesterday i...only got...3.50 for...uh...3.50 an hour..." and so she apologized and paid me the difference tonight.   stick me in front of a sold-out stadium and tell me to sing a solo, i'm fine. not nervous at all. but if i have totell someone that i've failed them and try to make it better or tell someone who has some sort of power over me that they're wrong, i'm about as good as a [insert clever comparison here].  so i now have 75 dollars, which is good. and that keller thing turned out better than i could have imagined. but i still missed my show, which i probably will feel horrid about for a week or two.   i think i'll go see the notebook again. if you haven't seen it, i highly suggest heading on over to the cheapo sometime soon.   i was thinking today that if i take metal shop in college, i could save up and get the instruments i need to have my own little metal studio out behind my house. it could be a combined metal/art studio, so i could paint and do metal work. and wood stuff too, obviously. inside, if i do graphic design, i'd just have a little office with my desktop computer, probably wirelessly linked to my laptop, a white board, and some rolo-dexes of webcolors. the place where i intern has tons of these rolo-dex things that are like rosco-dexes only they're of ink colors. because there's rbg and web colors, which are incredibly different things, and stuff like that. so i'd have some of those. and paper to sketch out ideas on, and a phone. but anyway, back to my metal shop.  i could make swords in my spare time, which would be the coolest thing ever. and big metal sculptures, and metal jewelery, and all sorts of metal-type things. it'd be awesome. 'specially if i lived in a gothic cathedral, because then i could have big metal things all over the place. it'd be creepy.
