I have already replied to many of the colleges that have mailed me, but there are so many of them that I still have no idea where I should go.  Here are the schools that I have received information from:  American University   Arcadia University   The Art Institutes   Avila University   Baker University   Calvin College   College of Santa Fe   Colorado College   Illonois Wesleyan University   Kansas State University   Loyola University Chicago   New York University   Rochester Institute of Technology   Southern Methodist University   University of Kansas   University of Miami   University of Minnesota   University of Missouri Columbia   University of Nebraska   University of Rochester   University of Southern California   University of Washington   Vassar College   Washington University in St. Louis   Colleges in the  urlLink PC Magazine    + More  As you can see, there are so many schools that I have looked at, and even more that I haven't looked at, that it's difficult to even know what's good. Another aspect that I have hardly considered yet is just how expensive some of these schools will be. Most of them are so far away that it will be hard to make a campus visit if I'm actually interested.
