I felt kind of bad, because even though I recognized the name, I didn't know I'd actually met Ingrid before. I feel annoyed with myself. Sorry! That night was pretty crazy though.  Kids plays should have time limits. Claudia I love you, but that show was like 5 years long. Meh. It doesn't help that I'm one of those annoying people who doesn't find kids and everything they do cute. So sue me. They're mean, dirty, smelly, rude, little and stupid. Explain how any of those are good things. I suppose they do fit in most overhead storage compartments, but that doesnt become important often. So back on topic, I snuck out after my sister's scene and went home with Jenny and ate food and watched Cowboy Bebop for 30 minutes, then came back literally the second it ended. That's what we call timing. So my sister thought I stayed for the whole thing and I didnt go insane. Good story.  I have come to the conclusion that my parents are stuck in their teenage years. Is it wrong to bring your mom along when shopping downtown? Its weird I know, but shes very cool sometimes. As for my dad. Let's just say that hes the only person over 40 I know that is obsessed with Buffy. And its not even to bond with me, heck I've never watched Buffy in my life. Not to mention he watched Cowboy Bebop with me tonight. Meh, I never understand adults.  Why is it I'm tired at midnight? This is so unlike me. I confronted my mom and tried to get her to confess that she's actually a practitioner of witchcraft but she claims she hasn't. That's what they always say. Maybe we should have a witch trial. In the morning, though, I'm tired.  PS. I want more people in my friends list, it makes me look like a loser. Meh, maybe I'll just add people myself.   Ah, the first signs that Eric is a shallow loser! Oh good! My favorite part here is where I mention never having seen Buffy. Ironic, no? And there was a time when I was fuzzy on Ingrid's identity. Strangeness. Nothing much to say here, just gawking at how boring my site was/is.
