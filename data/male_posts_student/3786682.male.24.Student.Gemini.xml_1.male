"managed" to get into an army truck which is usually very difficult..got lift uptil RTO and then walked for around 5 or 6 minutes and separated in groups of 3 each;my group consisting of yayati,bhavana and me. earlier we had a plan to go to some five star hotel like blue diamond or le meridien. on the way we got a lift and coincidently that guy was yayati's relative.he suggested us to go to Koregaon park where he said the probablity of finding a foreigner is more. he dropped us at koregaon park in front of the German Bakery.  there started the real quest of finding some foreigner and that too some international business executive. there were many foreigners who were sitting inside the bakery and we decided to talk to one of the guy who seemed to be a bit decent(unlike others who were looking more like hippis)..though it was sounding a bit awkward to talk to some guy like this but i managed to explain him the situation.he quickly called up one of his friends who was dealing with international business(marbles)..we talked to him but unfortunately couldnt pursue her to get what we wanted. then that guy suggested us to some place near the Osho ashram, where we were unfortunate again.found one american guy on the way and i just stopped him on the way and explained the situation.he was dealing with some interantional business but was busy with some work so refused to help us.we went inside the osho ashram, but didnt find any body there too. then we went to the Godrej millenium building where we went to companies like TCS,Reliance,Japan Life insurance,S1 but was in vain. then we moved to Zensar and Eureka Forbes which was just nearby. we decided to move to Satyam after that and after getting refusals from everywhere decided to eat vada pao in some shop.  after coming from there and attending Kamath sir's lecture we came to know the loophole in our approach.the one thing which i learnt from his lecture was to get help from anybody always make that person in front of u feel important.  this experience was indeed something which will always remain as  one of the most memorable moments of my life.  hope to do another business exercise in future soon and this time with SUCCESS.
