She told the class that if they worked hard enough that she would let them watch Maury at the end of the day. I am very offended by this show and I told her I wanted to leave the classroom for the time being. She let me and I am in the library typing this up. It really pisses me off that our class is so eager to watch Maury, a very crappy show. For those of you not familiar with the show, it is all about people's personal problems and how to deal with them. More likely then not they have to have a paternity (father) test to see who is the father of a child is. It pisses me off because they talk about it like it is no big deal that anybody cheats on them. They do these things all throughout the show. Let me tell you how the rest of my day is going. I assure you, it is much better.  TA: Well, I had to fix some computers. Lenny's english class came in to take a Star test. It was fun because he was reading most of the time. They came in once and we weren't ready for them. So they went back and read "The Crucible". Lenny said "Great, now I have to go back and read a book that I have read like 6 times already." I could only laugh.  Web-Page design: Well, I started working on the next project that is due on Friday. We have to make a "Sports" page. The only problem is: I don't play sports. She is letting me do SSBM instead. My partner was looking up pictures of the game playing and he found an interesting site. That is the "Site o' the day". Video Game museum. It has every game imaginable and some that aren't. They have a few screenshots from each one.   Lunch: As usual, we sat around and talked about video games. I am hopefully going over to Lenny's house and play Earth and Beyond. Supposedly it's a great game. If it is I will probably buy it and play with Lenny and Liam.  US History: As I mentioned before, she let them watch Maury. Actually, as we speak I am supposed to be in that class. I finished all the work before I left so she let me leave and come here. As I was leaving I prayed for that class. Everyone was excited because they got to watch Maury. Very stupid in my opinion.  Anyways, I think I should probably start heading out. Patty is picking me up from school (my neighbor). To answer a question people have asked forever. "Which came first the chicken or the egg?" God makes it pretty simple in Genesis. Read Genesis 1 and you will find the answer. Goodbye everyone, I will probably see many of you at Ground Zero tonight.
