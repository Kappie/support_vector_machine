Actually, i have to be honest with you, i write these a day in advance, so i write this one yesterday, and i write tommorows today, if that makes sense. So if i do anything in a different tense or wrote something that you know if wrong, let me know straight away!     Anyway, today (or yesterday) i'll be deciding who is the most immaturist person i know. Plus, i'll be deciding whether i should shave my head!    But first, other news:     People know that i love the simpsons, its the greatest cartoon on earth ever! Now, currently, officially, the creators, publishers, whatever you wanna call em, are on Season 4. Personally, i think that it doesnt get good till season 4, maybe theres a couple in the seasons before, but their not the funniest untill season 5. Apparently, Season 5 isnt coming out untill august, so i heard anyway. So the other week, i brought Seasons 14 and 15 on DVD off eBay. I was pleased with this purchase because Season 15 had about 12 episodes i hadnt seen before because on Sky one their still going through it, and their on about the 15th one i think. Anyway, i was on eBay again, and i saw Seasons 10 and 11 on DVD!!! I couldnt believe my eyes! I've got to buy them, but then if i do its another thing on my list of things to buy. So i gotta add it to my list of my provisional, money for the hols, money for my new phone, and money for Spiderman 2 game. So, since Simpsons is so important to me, i thought i might aswell buy it. I'll send off for my provisional when i get a job because its no use having it when i cant afford lessons, and i have a feeling my moms gonna buy my the game, plus my new phones on loan from my dad, so i'll still have it but i'll be in debt to him. Moving on...    I still havent heard anything from safeway, hopefully i will before sunday...i'll get into that after the ranking though:    Ok, so here we go. The people involved in this are me (Craig), Martin, Jason, Andrew, Joe, Sam, Ross, Mike and Mark. I'm basing this upon how i know them, plus what other people have said:     Sam - i've heard a lot of people say that they think that Sam is the most childish person out of us lot, and i must say that they are right. I've told him on several occasions, but does he do anything about it? No! He says he needs a girlfriend, but who would want to go out with someone that is 17 coming on 5? Reasons: Punching people when he see's a yellow car, punching random things, throwing food, taking bags, hitting things out of peoples hands, acting like an infant! Also, his stupidity comes into play a bit aswell, as he thought i was making a film about door handles in film studies!  Ross - You wouldnt expect it from Ross of all people, but yes he is slightly less childish than Sam. So Ross, if you read this, now you know where you are ranked, i'd change, before westart getting you confused with Sam, and thats a bad thing. Reasons: Taking bags even though he doesnt like it, throwing food, punching people for no reason, being silly.  Joe - Same as Sam and Ross really, just toned down a bit. Joins in with Sams punching games.  Mike - For a christian, he is pretty silly. When we first met him, he was calm, but since hanging around with us, his hyperactiveness has gone through the roof, just look at makin jasons nose bleed.  Andrew/Mark - Yes its joint here, because i cant decide who is more immature. I wouldnt say that they are that immature, but this is where i would rank them  Martin/Jason/Craig - Yep and its joint here aswell. Simply because we can act our age and not throw food even when tempted to. Martins grown up a lot at college, and Jasons always been mature. And yes i have had my moments, but i dont throw friggin' chips around after snooker or take peoples shoes off and throw them around.    So there you have it, the official ranking of immaturity. Maybe i could of/should of done a vote or a border line thing as in Sam, Ross, Joe, Andrew Mark/Jason, Martin, Me. And Mark, Joe, Ross, Sam, Andrew - if you want to argue with me that your in the wrong place, then do so, because i can argue back and i will win because i know how childish you are, with the chances of me winning going down in order of ranking.   Was it just me, or was this past week a bad week to end on? I'd of rather done full days of lessons than first aid, simply because i didnt enjoy first aid enough, plus the breaks were short and took the piss big time! Even Sams said that he didnt want to end this week. Awww i miss college already. I'm hoping that i'll still be innext year. I've got to make the most out of next year because its our last year, and i dont wanna stay another year because my brother will probably be coming there and i dont wanna be in the same house as him, let alone the same college! Next thing you know he'll be working with me! But he is going to join the army so i'm pleased about that.   I know this was a long time ago, but i dont think that Eastenders should of won the best soap award - its too depressing! Corrie should of won it definetly because that is the greatest soap on earth, and you gotta love Kirk! Also, what the hell was that all about with Jessie Wallace winning the sexiest actress! She looks like a pig thats been tested in the labs. There are a lot of females in soaps that deserved to win that! Oh, and Eastenders just pissed me off at them awards...why did Sonia win the best youngster? Shes about 20 aint she? I'll tell you who should of won it, Chesney from Corrie...he's so funny even if he is ginger.   Recently i've been watching Hollyoaks for some reason. I didnt even like it when i watched it, yet i still watched it the next day. This was the late night ones by the way, and i probably just kept the channel on after Big Brother.   By the way, Dan to win BB5! And if you think that wanting a gay man to win makes me gay, then you can go screw and start fantasising about something else...dirty buggas! Oh and for the record, didnt Brian win the second one? I doubt that it was just women and other gays that voted for him, i bet there was straight men to!   Anyway, i think i've made a big enough gap between the 2 main subjects, so lets get on with it shall we!   Ok, so heres the situation. I am thinking of cutting my hair......short! I'm not talking just a light trim, but right down the the skin till its about a millimeter of hair. And i'm planning on doing this on sunday. Why though? Well you probably all know that i have curly hair, and when it gets long, theres nothing i can do with it. Plus i wanna get rid of my quiff, lol. I've had it since year 10 and i fancy a change to see how well it suits me. So why am i debating about this? Well i dont know whether to or not. If i cut it short, then theres nothing i can do about it but wait till it grows back, and it might loo stupid. But if i risked it, then it might look alright and i wouldnt have a problem and i've found myself a new style for next year. And i dont know if you've seen it but theres this blonde bit at the front which is bugging me and its right down to the skin so i cant cut my hair just a little bit to get rid of it, its all gonna have to come off! If i keep it long, then its gonna look stupid, and i'm going on holiday in august so it would leave white bits around the sides if i cut it a bit.   Earlier i was talking about safeway. If they get back to me before sunday saying i havent got it, then i'll do it, but if i have got it then i wont, so hopefully they'll get back to me before then so i can make up my mind.   Now i know this wasnt the best subject to write about, but hey, i'm doing this thing daily, so i need subjects to write about!  Until then though,  this has been Craig signing off....  ...back to the studio....   -Peace-
