Well, I called him at 2:10 PM because I was in the car with my parents and I didn't know when we were going to stop again. So I took out my cellphone and dialed his cellphone number. Well, when he picked up, he screamed and started yelling at something. I thought he was yelling at his kids or something. Something not so important. And there was silence. So I hung up.  Later when we stopped at Target, I called him again and I was informed that he just got into a car accident. I felt so bad. I thought I had caused it. But he assured me it wasn't my fault. I just had really bad timing. I just called to check that Thursday was still okay. Last Thursday, I stayed extra long to make up for the previous Thursday's absense. The previous Thrusday, Mr. Laskey didn't show up. He said that he lost my phone number so he couldn't have called me. So there I was at the high school and I was free for an hour. So I decided to go to the auditorium and play.  It was awesome. The acoustics in that room was steller.   Last Thursday, Mr. Laskey introduced me to another scale. This time, I went into seventh position. Sigh. Its really high. When it gets that high, I have a hard time remembering the note names. The notes pretty much only get recognized by the finger I use to play them. I should work on that. Especially with half and whole steps. Laskey also advanced me on the Viotti piece. Its pretty good. The way I was playing it before was different that the way he told me to play it. He told me to use third position on the A string. Which I guess makes more sense. Although my fourth finger G is always out of tune. My fourth finger is always out of tune for any note.  Biscombe came back. So she wants to have a get-together at her house on Friday. Of course I'm going. She's a cool kid. Plus, she said that she'll copy her calculus packet for me. Since I lost mine.   While I was cleaning my room, I found the LIST OF THINGS TO DO that Charlotte and I made in sophomore year. I think that was the time when we talked the most. Last year, we barely had any classes together. But we were closer. Maybe this year, we'll be bothmore talkative and closer to each other. She's a cool kid too, although she makes me mad sometimes. Especially when she's moody or dealing with another problem with Kevin.  Speaking of Kevin. He gets me so angry when he compares himself to other people. Like how he says he's not awesome anymore since he failed his driver's test. Pfft. I don't think anyone would care too much if he did fail. No one would think less of him. Maybe I'm insensitive. But thats all BS. "Wow, PSAT score. How did I get that? I'm so dumb!" Shut up little fucker.  Sigh.
