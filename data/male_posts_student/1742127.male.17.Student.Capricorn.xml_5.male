School's almost over, thank goodness. I'm ready to get this whole mess over with. I know that I have to take all of the semester exams because I was absent more than 2 days at school. :( Poopy (as Ross would say... lol)  Speaking of Ross, I think that what he is going through is CRAP. I wish that I could just hit the poo out of some people. Ross is one of the sweetest guys in the world and one day he will find the RIGHT girl for him. I hope that's soon, because I'm sick of seeing him hurt. :) Mikey... hmm.. Mikey... things are going good between us. Really good. I love having him there with me to make me smile. He is truly the greatest! I couldn't ask for more.  As for movies, I just watched Gothika the other day. (Definately not as scary as they made it out to be!) It was really good though. I dunno, I thought it had a really good plot that kept you guessing and everything.  Sunday when I went to Church guess who was there!??! Sean Bradley. He plays for the Dallas Mavericks. Some people may say oh poo, he stinks... he's not that great.. he's a bencher... whatever... I think it's awesome. He's 7'6 and it was really kool to see someone famous in the little town of Graham at MY church!!!!  Have you ever head the song, "I Believe In A Thing Called Love"...? It's by "The Darkness". It's hilarious. Ross and Mikey introduced that one to me and to our surprise..umm about 2 weeks later... we heard it on T.V. and when we looked it was on the advertising to Shrek 2! Awesome! Have to see that one!!! Well, I guess I'll go! Later! ~ChRiStIn
