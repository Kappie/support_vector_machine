Chuck Hagel of Nebraska told NBC that the administration needs to "be honest with the Congress, be honest with the American people."  "Every ground squirrel in this country knows that it's going to be $50 billion to $75 billion in additional money required to sustain us in Iraq for this year," said Hagel, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which also held hearings on Iraq.  Yeah, it's pretty obvious that Iraq and Afghanistan is going to require additional budget appropriations.  To think that the White House is trying to 'hide' the obvious is kind of silly.  Who DOESN'T think it's going to cost more?  According to Richard Myers, they are working on the accurate estimates before submitting the request.  I'm sure we'll see it before the election.  Besides, if they came in either high or low, the Left would shriek about either 'trying to mislead' or 'overspending'.  Why go through that?  Just wait until you have a good solid number.  Again I have to question the seriousness of the people complaining.  Any reasonable person knows what's at stake here.  Why do we continue to put our own operations, resolve, and soldiers at risk for the sake of political points when the outcome is so crucial to our future?  Is it really that difficult to get behind the idea that we are at war?
