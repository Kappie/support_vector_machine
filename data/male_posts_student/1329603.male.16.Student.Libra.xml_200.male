The Les Mis performances were cool, although to my mind they started brilliantly and ended on a comparative low (I think it would have still been a high if I wasn't judging it against the first night, though). Was über-fun to do. I'm really going to miss all of the peoples who have been really nice during it... mostly James, Harry, Josie + Chrissie, Phil + Christina, Simon, Susie, Liv, Jack, Joe, N'omi, Rhi (obviously), Barley and Tom, who is in actuality an adult-ish but he's so irresponsible it's just funny...  Prime example of Tom's irresponsibility was yesterday. I'll get onto that though, I'll go step by step. Well, afterwards, I got my banner from Scott *hugs* and got changed. Oh, actually, missed out a stage.  Went into town with all the peoples at 3ish, and we wandered round, mostly in Millennium Music where we spent over an hour buying a plectrum (there was a woman called Laura something who Shez knows. Pity Shez wasn't with us at the time. But anyway, she's cool). Met Shez, and I bought cards for Liv, Phil + Christine, Jo + N'omi + Barley, Jake, Simon, James and Josie + Chrissie (my reasoning for not getting Jack one was that I bought him one for his birthday so that can suffice in my opinion. I only have a finite amount of money). That ended up costing me £11.55. Anyway, took t'lads back to my house and went off to Les Mis. You know, then we had the performance which went well. Liv and I both cried quite a lot during Rain. In My Life was as heartbreaking for me as always.  Right, back to afterwards. We had the after show party! Woo! I played the guitar and made up a "We finished Les Mis" song and basically the entire cast joined in clapping in time. It ruled. Simon, Phil and I did Californication together and Under The Bridge... this is what you get for knowing RHCP fans. Oh, and I did a Piano + Guitar/Vocs duet, with one of the backstage crew, of Imagine, and that was pretty cool. We also did a piano duet of Peter Gunn, in which I did my tune bit and let him improv. You know how these jazz players are. Seriously, though, the guy was on fire. Not literally. We spent the rest of the time really singing through songs and swapping roles - for instance, Phil and I did the docks, Phil being Fantine and... well, I'm glad that's probably not something people got a picture of. We did One Day More and I got to be Javert! Yay! Found out Liz, Jack's mini sister, is actually... not that mini... in fact she's 16. Now, I find her good looking, so I'm glad she's not as old as I thought she was. I thought she was in like Yr9, not Yr11... that's the only recent misjudging of age that I've made where I've judged someone to be younger than they actually are. But yeah, still... über-cool thing was, she had 2 people coming to see her, and one of them was the flautist (Beccy) for GODS' Music Night, that I did the trombone for way back in October. Well, I talked to her a fair bit. I really didn't expect to see her ever again. That was odd.  Anyway, went back to Andrea's afterwards and we basically... well, sad to say but we did things like this; "Look down, look down, don't fart 'em in the eye. Look down, look down, you're here until you fart. The fart is strong, it's hot as hell below. Look down, look down, there's 20 farts to go. I've done no fart... sweet Jesus, hear my fart..." and so on. Sorry, Les Mis fans. It was incredibly fun though. Oh, and Beccy sat on my lap and we were generally closish. Which is odd, given that meeting again ever would be incredibly unlikely. But yeah, she was cool, and not so sensible as last time. Which is a good thing, believe me. But yeah... Barley got pissed on like a glass of gin. Oh, while I think about it, whisky and Pepsi is not a good mixer. Trust me. Liv thought what I'd written in her card was really sweet and gave me a lot of hugs and sat on me for quite a while. I think I'm becoming a bit of a ladies' man. Oh well, it's nice to have someone there. It would be nicer if I actually was going out with them but that's not looking likely for a while, at least. Anyway. Yeah, we watched the dress rehearsal (it was recorded) and I ruled for some of it... I'm sorry, but I did! I'm proud of me at the moment. Getting to sleep was the hard part. At the beginning I was kinda sharing a cover with James but N'omi (who Tom said probably fancied me... not meaning to sound really smug but it was guessable, she has that puppy-dog look with me all the time. Which either means she wants me, din-dins, or both)  said it'd work better if she had less room because she's smaller (like 1 foot smaller) so I went to where she'd been and head-to-toed with Harry, who's small but has really long legs so it's hard to get comfy. Anyway, so I got bugger all sleep.  But yeah. Really tired. That took too long *dies*. The thing about being over-tired is I get very depressed, it's what happens to me, so I'm kinda thinking about someone who lives near Winchcombe a lot.
