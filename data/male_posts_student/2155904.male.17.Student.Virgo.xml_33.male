He did have some cake though.  It is good cake.  Anybody want some?  His mom left for San Jose until Friday so now it is just him and his dad til then.  That should be interesting.  Probably going to be a quiet house for that time.  Poor Tyke had a headache all day so at about 4 he took a nap and that made it go away.  Then he woke up and nobody was home.  That is a weird situation.  When you fall asleep with people home and then get up and like you yell, "Hey Justin (or whatever your siblings name may be)" and since nobody is there, there is no answer.  So he just lounged around more.  Then he got online and popped in Love Songs for Landreth and listened to that.  Great CD.  It started quite a little mood change when it was first introduced to the public.  Tyke and Skippy felt pretty lonely back in those days.  Times have changed but they still are not real happy with their situations.  But now Tyke is going to be making a Christmas CD and that is going to be real good for him.  And also he is going to make a CD for Haras because she loves getting CD's and Tyke loves to please.  He talked to Haras online for the first time today.  She is really cool.  They have been friends forever.  Like since 1st grade.  That is a long time.  I Melt is playing right now.  That is a great song too.  I meeeeeeeeellllllllt every time you look at me that way.  Tyke is going to make videos over this winter break.  That is going to be soooo much fun.  Music videos would be so cool to do.  So to close Tyke would like to say hello to Skippy, Macaroon, Tyronius, Tina, Purdy, Mandy, Karla, Dottie, Haras, Kinker, Amed, Commander Cool, and all of the other members of The Twisted Tales of Tyke Turner and Skippy McPipe/Obsessive Stories About Tyke and Tina because you are the people that keep this little life of his exciting, pleasant, happy, and worth living.  Without you his life would be nothing.  This one's for you ;).
