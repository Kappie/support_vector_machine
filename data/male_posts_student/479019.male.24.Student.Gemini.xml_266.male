As if the produce here wasn't bad enough, it's making things even worse!  Kind of another lazy day. It's funny... I always follow up good active days with days of absolute nothing. Yesterday I went over to Chi-Wei's place for dinner... myself along with a bunch of other people. It was cool, because pretty much everything that his wife cooked was like total Taiwanese stuff... like my mom used to make. It was cool eating that stuff, because it's been almost 2 months since I've eaten food like that. I should really learn how to make that stuff like that. I mean... it's stuff I grew up on... it'd be a nice treat for myself every so often. Also lots of the snacks we had while chatting after dinner was stuff I haven't had since I was a kid.   Let's see things for me to do... I need to finish my readings for 601 and I really need to get going on my reading paper and research paper for 620. As for comparative state formations... man... I really don't care about that class anymore.  Also I've been trying to archive my mp3s on CD recently... it's really a bitch. I wish I had $200 handy so that I can get an external hard drive.  ***
