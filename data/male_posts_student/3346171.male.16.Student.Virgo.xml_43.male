I cannot go there with money.   I was thinking about somethings today morning... about human beings, how silly we are. When we are young, we want to look older, when we are old, we want to look younger, younger but not fool. When we get a job, we want to rest , and when we don't have a job we want one badly. And there are lots of other examples.
