Artificial need created by Apple, need to impress with gadgets and there is probably one more, but I can't think of it right now.    Artificial need creation   This is one of the main complaints against advertising, that it makes people think they need things they don't. It's responsible for the sterile cleanliness of houses of today. 50 years ago there was no domestos, but somehow people managed to survive those nasty bacteria. However in this case they might be making me think that I need this because it will make me cool.   Need To Impress / Image   Everyone knows I'm a mac nerd, so I have to have the stuff that makes me a mac nerd right? I need it to help highlight my image etcetera. It's hard to explain, let's just say why do people pay so much for that little thing that says "Gucci"  If I think of the reasons I am using to justify my purchase they are: Can use it at the gym Don't have to borrow john's discman Listen to music at any time Games, for when im bored Superiour product design Works best with iTunes  (ie can't buy a cheaper one)  Are those decent reasons to spend an obscene abount of money?  Other things I could buy: 2 More Gamecube controllers (Wireless),  Mariokart Double Dash!!, Soul Caliber 2 and Fzero x Good speakers for my computer, and have $ left over  I've survived without music 27 / 7 before. Why can't I now?
