Tooo much work man....Integration,for which i literally have to diffrentiate my brain w.r.t. x. Then physics...chapter after chapter getting over in class.  And to add to the hulaabaloo....First my decision to give SAT and then my decision to overcome the apprised decision.  Now seems like if at all i give,it would be the new SAT launching spring of nxt year.  AND OFCOURSE...how can i forget computers?I/O classes flying above the head at the speed of light relative to the frame of my moment's reference.  And here's the irony....even after all that,i still have the audacity to waste my time here,blogging away to glory.  Had a nice day today,atleast till now.Tushar got frustrated to the skin with my talk with prateek on Einstein's SPECIAL Relativity theory.  But i mUST return to the books... Have a nice day....(if u r lucky enough...which not many ppl. are after reading my blog!!)
