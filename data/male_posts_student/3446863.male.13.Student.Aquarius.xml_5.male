This blog is strictly work-oriented and assumes that all your blog entries are suitable for all ITKC Members.  At the moment, ITKC is in its infancy and so I'm assuming myself as the Blog Moderator but once we locate a suitable member for the post, this post will belong to them.  That's it from me...  Regards,  Tom, ITKC Blog Moderator (Temporary)
