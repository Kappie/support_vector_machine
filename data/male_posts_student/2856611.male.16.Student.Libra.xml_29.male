T'was really cool, there I am just a scrubbing away and I say "Hmm... wonder if the water should really be flooding around the door" anyhow, without any worry I finished my shower then decided to sort it out, wasted a shower mat, two towels and my clothes in drying it all up. Heh. Anyhow in other news, got my very last maths tutor session today! *dances* I can't believe I can now sleep in on sunday mornings! *dances again* no but in all fairness it has been worth it, I feel alot more confident in maths, example, in my non-calculator I got really pissed off and stopped working cause I convinced myself I had screwed up and then I was like "Wait I can do this!" and I did, I think I did okay. Anyhow yes lots of exams lately, had Welsh on friday, 15 bloody minutes. 15. I get up at 7:30am to sit in school for 15 minutes. Well thats fan-bloody-tastic! Oooo! On my way home from that me and Nick were taking a "short-cut" through the woods (which was open to the path we were waling up) and I said "Oh look a bank, its linked to the main road I think" so I started climbing the bank as Nick crossed the river and this guy pulls up in his car (bare in mind me and Nick never crossed any full fences or signs) and he said "What are you doing?" and I carried on climbing thinking he thought I needed help and he gets out and says "This is private property" so I say "Oh sorry I didn't know, I'll go" so he starts shouting at me and swearing at me threatening to kick the crap out of me and as I'm leaving whilst apologising and explaining I didn't know it was private he bloody kicks me in the ribs. I mean there was no need, I apologised and was leaving the area so there was absoloutly no need to kick me, he said "Does it look like its not private property", may I ask what does private property look like? Anyhow got two exams tomorrow, Chemistry and English (Wahay last English exam... I think), I'm really tired but on the other hand I have a new Lindsay Lohen (Mean Girls) poster *smiles*, I thank Charli for that! What other things do I have to say? Not much. Ooo Chili Peppers are soon! Looking forward to that alot. Um Luke Smith (Smitty) IS the sex. Done.
