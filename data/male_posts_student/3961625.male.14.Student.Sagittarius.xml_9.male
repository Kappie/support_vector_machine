That was quite nice, and we stayed there until around 5. Then it started pouring so we lept into the car and drove to the other set of Grandparents, Stevens family... there we quickly saw there ovens (they run a bakery) and picked up Stevens mother. We then drove for about an hour to the coast, where we first took a long and pleasant walk along the seaside, and then ate supper (steak in a mushroom cream sauce) in a mildly fancy restaurant. We then dropped off the boys (thank God) at the apartment Stevens mother owns, which by the way is right on the coast, with a really beautiful view, which includes France and Holland. Then Nancy, Steven, Eusebie and I went for a very long walk, during which we stopped at a pub and got a couple of drinks (hot chocolate for me). Then we drove home. A very nice day.   BTW: If any of you travelers out there wish to post about your days, please feel free to do so.
