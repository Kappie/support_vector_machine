       
      A long day of school. Feeling kind of tired and not in a good mood due to the results of my midterms. Let's just say I have to work my ass off in my classes to get grades I consider acceptable. I'm also feeling anxiety over grad admissions, feeling a bit bummed because I'm not talking to my friend that I normally talk to everyday, and I need to get lots of reading done (as usual). I'm sure life will straighten itself out, but things have just been so hectic lately in my life. I can't wait until spring break. I kind of want to do something like camping, just to escape everything and everyone.  I guess the song of the moment is Joey Ramone's cover of "What a Wonderful World" that's due out on his upcoming  Don't Worry About Me  album.  *
