Woo, just realised that a grand total of three (yeah,  three !) people have read my blog, which in my book constitutes world stardom.  I'm fucking sick of people asking me about holidays. I may be entirely alone in this, but I  hate  going on holiday. Maybe it's the fact that I actually have to do things with my family, maybe it's the godawful places they choose to go to, maybe I'm just someone who hates everything no matter what it is, but going on holiday is definitely one of my least favourite experiences. And  then , to make the whole fucking charade even worse, anyone I ever talk to ever feels the need to bombard me with the following questions:  "Have you been on holiday? Where did you go? When did you go? What was it like? What was the weather like? What did you do? Are you going on holiday again? Where are you going? Is it possible for me to ever stop talking about fucking holidays?"  Like I say, I accept that I am in the minority on this issue. Just, don't talk to me about holidays. Please.  Daniel
