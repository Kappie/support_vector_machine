I remember before the war even started that I had commented that Bush is probably thinking he can recreate the post WWII economic prosperty via growth in military spending. Space exploration research is totally a part of military spending. Let's not forget that things like rockets and satellites lead to the development of ICBMs. I think that Bush really does believe that development in this sector will not only increase the country's economic might, but military might.  I really don't want us to be building bigger and better bombs when inner city schools suffer. The whole trickle down theory is total bullshit. It's never worked in the past, and it is unlikely it ever will. Yet I can't help but think of all the cool things I have as a result of space shuttle research. Computers, plastics, and cell phones are pretty neat things to have. Yet it is an intensification of capitalism in which we will be sucked further into the system... or in the case of the poor... excluded?  ***
