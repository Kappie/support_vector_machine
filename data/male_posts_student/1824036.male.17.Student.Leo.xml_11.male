Pedro needs to post in here, besides bitching about his lack of cable TV.  Keep in mind, dear reader, that when Pedro was born, I was his age.  Nonetheless, that's  no obstacle for two guys to talk about wrestling.  Right?  Right.  Anyway, this is where I list off my All-Time favorite wrestlers, and then encourage Peter to weigh in with his own takes.  (Come on WeeWee, I know you got it in you!)  So here's my All-Time Drewcifer Hall of Fame List:   #1--Randy "Macho Man" Savage  -- OoooH Yeah!!  I became his biggest fan in 1997 when he was in Wrestlemania III against Ricky Steamboat.  He went on to become a face after that match.  What really made me mark out for him was when was the following November when he was wrestling Honky Tonk Man for the I-C title on Saturday Night's Main Event.  The Hart Foundation interfered and Honky ended up bashing Macho up against the head with his gitaur.  Elizabeth (RIP) ran backstage and brought out the Hulkster.  Anyway, Savage and Hulk ended up forming an alliance, and come Wrestlemania IV, Savage won the WWF World Title.  Of course it led up to an eventual Hogan/Savage feud for Wrestlemania V.  No matter.  In 1989, I was lucky enough to see a Savage-Hogan match in Winston-Salem, NC.  There's only one wrestler who has made me mark out as hardcore as Randy Savage did..which brings me to #2...   #2--"Stone Cold" Steve Austin -- WHAT? I'm still doing that bit with people...Anyway..I stopped watching wrestling for a few years, pretty much because I was married with a child and all.  I kept up with all that was going on in wrestling through 3rd party sources.  I was told by a guy that I worked with back in '98 that Stone Cold Steve Austin was arrested for beating up Vince McMahon.  I had no clue that Vince was involving himself in storylines.  I decided to tune into RAW to see what was going on and what I had been missing for a couple of years.  At the top of the show, Stone Cold comes out, starts drinking beer. flips off his fans, and he gets to beat the hell out of his boss.  That's the ultimate American Dream, right there.     #3--"Mr. Perfect" Curt Hennig (RIP)   Not so much I can say about the guy.  He was the AWA Champ before dropping the belt to Jerry Lawler (Yes, the King).  When he came to the WWF, he had a series of vignettes where he nailed a three-pointer from the top of the key  (swish) , putted a 50 foot putt in the cup, hit a homer over the Green Monster, bowled a strike, won at chess, he was absolutely perfect in every way!  He had a couple reigns with the I-C title.  I loved his attitude going into the ring.  I still emulate it to this day.  When I walk into work, I don't swat my gum away, but I strut like he did, back in the day.   #4--Ric Flair -- I spent many a year hating Flair.  Back in the day, I used to go to the monthly NWA shows at the Greensboro Coliseum where you could get in for five bucks.  The main event was always Flair vs. Lex Luger, or Sting, or Terry Funk, or whoever.  Flair always managed to cheat to win.  I always walked awy from those matches at the Coliseum cursing Flair.  It didn't occur to me until recently that that was the way a heel champion was supposed to do things.  It's fitting that nowadays that he's more or less HHH's manger.  If you're going to have heel champion, then you have to have a guy that people love to hate.   #5--Hulk Hogan -- Anyone who was a wrestling fan in the '80's and claims they didn't mark out for the Hulkster is a liar.  Hulk Hogan made mainstream Pro-Wrestling (sports entertainment) what it is today.     #6--Barry Windham --Hard to believe that I would pick him, but he was the first wrestler I saw who could snap off any type of suplex in the books.  This guy could have wrestled  me  and pull off a good match.  His push with the Four Horsemen was abruptly derailed by Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard jumping to the Fed in '89.  Windham soon followed suit and went to the Fed as the Widowmaker, but that gimmick fell flat.  I'll always remeber Windham as the heel who would come out to the ring with the big black cowboy hat, and the chaps.  He had that loner, Johnny Cash thing going on.  Nevermind what he looked like, Windham was like Kurt Angle in the ring.  He could have taken my cat and make it a great match.  Pedro?  Bring on your favorites!
