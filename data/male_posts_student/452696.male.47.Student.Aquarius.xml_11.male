    
       12 more days at work before I retire. I seem to have a choice now of whether I can work really hard and help out this organization I've given 25 years of my life to, or, not. As a result of the last several weeks of my managers avoidance of current projects which would pilot elearning applications within the CPS, I could just do..nothing or go stir the nest with a stick. I'm perplexed. Guess I need to go and make some inquiries with the poobah and see if there is a clearer vision from high atop the mountaintop as to what I should do.  I hope we don't alienate some more Alberta based companies through lack of decision and vision. I'm...feeling like I'm in some bad sitcom. People don't really act like this in reality do they? We'll see . . .
