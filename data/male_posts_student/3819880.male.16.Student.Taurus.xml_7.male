Ate a bagel, read the comics, did nothing, the usual.  I went to Five Seasons at 1 and returned home at 2:30, unfortunately finding out that Planet Smoothie was closed during my return trip.  Took a shower at 4, then proceeded to put in my contancts and attempt to sculpt my hair by means of a good-smelling wax which my hair-cutter-person had me buy.    The real action started at 5.  I arrived at Carolyn's hizouse and played poker with Quinn, Ellen, Liz and some of her friends.  I got second, but we ended the game prematurely so I easily could have won in the end.  But the highlight of the game was when Quinn got out on the second hand, the first time I'd ever seen him do so poorly at poker.  I ate a delicous - orgasmic, actually - cupcake for desert.  Nicole and her friend then left to go to the Winnetka fireworks.  Despite my persistence that the rest of us follow suit, we wound up goign to the beach.  Rachel was at the fireworks.  Despite the fact that we had been close freshman year, I felt disconnected from her tonight, so I'm pretty sure our friendship is down the drain.    After the fireworks we met up with a drunken Jake and Jeremy, which was very annoying.  Jake overplayed the whole thing, and was being very attention-whore-ish; Jeremy was fine about the whole thing.  Jake and Jeremy both wound up riding away on their bikes despite the girls pleas for them not to (and then they worried the rest of the time), Ilana walked home, and Caroline walked me back to Carolyn's to pick up my car.  I dropped her off and Jakes and then went home.  We were supposed to call Nicole, but we never did...she probably feels betrayed or something, but she wasn't missing anything.    I talked to Carolyn for a while over AIM, nothing really came out of the conversation.  We decided that I should go out with Caroline (I gave her and Ilana the task of getting me a girlfriend, just for the hell of it).    I found out that Garbage is a  really  sketchy band.  They have songs about hermaphrodites.  I don't know about you, but I consider that sketchy.    I'm gonna go now.  Good night.   - Brian
