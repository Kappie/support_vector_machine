Everything's been fairly normal since then. Didn't do any revision after school in the evenings, but did some homework. Err, that's about my whole week explained. Didn't go out any where, no interesting days at school... Well, I've done a bit of physics revision this morning, and I'm feeling more confident about it than I was a few weeks ago when doing those tests. I really need to do some maths revision at some point, haven't done any yet. Maths is generally fairly easy though.  Enough about that, I reccomend this:  urlLink everybuddy . If you join up, every time you change your msn name, it will be put on the site for all to see, and you can see every one elses. Well, I liked it anyway. This is also well worth a read, if I haven't told you about it already:  urlLink Molecules with silly or unusual names . Very funny. I'll probably put these links on the side aswell.  Well, physics books are lying open beside me, and I really don't want to learn theat boring stuff. Even though it's probably the most interesting subject there is. Maybe maths. I'd better do some work, or I'll feel guilty. Meh, I'll do a bit more physics. Bye for now.   Playing:  Nowt  Listening To:  A CD full of piano music  Watching:  Friends, Have I got news for you, Derren Brown, Distraction last night  Annoyed With:  Revision  Confused About:  Nothing especially  Mood:  ok, I suppose
