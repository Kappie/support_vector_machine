So we were dismissed early and met in the canteen, most people weren’t too serious, but i sure wasn’t anyway... i'll tell you why later. anyways after warm up we got onto the pitch we played around for awhile. Finally the refs walked to the center of the pitch and the coin was tossed and stuff, the whistle blew. the game had begun, the first half was pretty uneventful though, i got a reverse chop which was on target, but sadly it flew out, besides that the game was pretty even. Second half i picked up my pace, making a few nice dribbles and centering the ball once, then toward the middle of the second half i dribbled past a defender into the D and got a short corner.i dragpushed the ball to chun men who stopped it smoothly and sent me a nice pass to the top D. i took a first timer... the ball hit the goalkeepers pads and went in with a resounding "bang". i was filled with joy, bursting with it perhaps, but this wasn’t it, this was not how i used to feel when we won.  This was my first 3rd 4th placing ever, i had always had the good fortune of being in the finals. So why was that not the case this time round? Firstly, of the entire team of 19, 12 were sec1 and only 7 were sec2, in the first team of 11, 7 were sec1 and only 4 were sec2! for the last two years there have only been 1 or 2 sec1s in the first team! I’d like to congratulate all you sec1s though and I think you guyz played well, it wasn’t your fault that we lost, it was your first major tournament and you guyz were visibly nervous, but it was not your fault. I feel that it was bulls fault. last year he neglected the sec1s causing many to drop out so we had to use many sec1s this year. So very frankly we were weak, people should not have expected us to win anything with our team, infact I was pretty amazed that we managed to make it this far. I’d like to point out that it hurts alot when people say "you are the captain of the first hockey team in seven years to not take the championship title". Hopefully after reading this you have realized that it was not my fault and that the team has actually done "well" I mean, next years team is going to be like really strong… if you know I’m talking about you, feel regretful now. Cos I have given my f******g best and it is none of ur f******g buisness, beat it.  As I was saying the 3rd 4th did not matter much to me,  people only remember the best and the lousiest , so I feel that between 3rd and 4th, there is no diff.
