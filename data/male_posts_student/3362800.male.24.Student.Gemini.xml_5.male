It's still a long time to go.Sometimes, I felt that is very boring to repeating doing the same stuff everyday.Days are dull, trying to find a moment to rest and taste a cool breeze.. at Pulau Perhentian, or Pulau Redang, but, definitely, not Pulau Singapura!!!  3 years on this Pulau has changed me a lot.From a nerd,to become more nerdy..=P.Everyone told me that it's very stress to study in singapore.I also felt so, but no more.. Nowadays ,the thing that i am most concern is,when can i go back to my hometown and relax..  Malaysia,still is the best place for my for my future....   Dated  1.20 pm  17th May 2004
