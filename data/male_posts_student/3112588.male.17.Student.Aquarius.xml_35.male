LoL!) that was sooo much fun you guys (suzy, sarah, daniella, and laura). my dad was there, and he was like: uhh hey? what are you guys doing here? we're like: dad--duh its the snow retreat! we totally chilled, ate up ALL the food, watched Ace Ventura (hehe), and then walked back down through the snow with all kinds of snow toys (tobagan, sleds, etc)...but yeah, that weekend was the last time we REALLY talked. thank God for sisters in the Lord like Laura--she is always willing to listen, think before she speaks, and doesn't blow you off like you're a total nut (although i am)! i was just washing the van and thinking: you know noah, you have some very good friends...so what are you always worrying about? does there always have to be some type of something going on for you to function? i often ask myself why i cannot live life without some type of challenge--why cant i just accept things for how they are? its hard for me, but if im ever going to "get better", ive gotta start somewhere. now i know that prob tons of you are like: ok, here we go again--he SAYS he's going to start, but tonight, he'll be all out of sorts and trippin' over something...WRONG guys. some things just have to happen for me to finally mean what i say. my aunt angela had a stillborn baby about 10 weeks ago, and she sent a letter to my mom...the letter was just saying that the Lord has carried her along this long road, and that she feels safe and comforted although tradgedy blindsided her. i look at her, and think: wow--her full term baby was born dead, and im sitting here worrying about whether or not my friends might ditch me--when i know they wont?! what kind of idiot am i? life is just TOO short to sit here and worry about everything. where is the fun or learning experience in that? ive thrown myself out there this summer, and i did it b/c i knew that no matter what, the Lord would protect me throughout my trials and the hard times. am i sick of there always being problems? of course. but the question i have to ask myself is this: if i stop worrying, how many LESS problems would there be? wow--just thinking about that made me realize: noah, you know what? if you stopped worrying RIGHT this second, every "problem" would go away (well most of them). i guess i am a problem in a sense, but God still loves me, and He wants me to learn from all the experiences that ive had since the beginning of summer. i know that He has something planned for me, but why do i always have to try and figure it out? well, its b/c if im not in control, i freak out! i mean, ive sat here and typed for almost 3 months, and you've seen that i cant do things correctly on my own! even i know that! but why do, everytime i see a POTENTIAL problem--that isnt even a problem yet-- i take matters into my own hands and make them worse. even i know that God can do things better than i can...i just havent learned how to let go yet. i want to--and who can help me? i was talking to my aunt, and ive even posted it on here: no person can comfort me. when God made me, he left something out on purpose--the lack of being able to be comforted by another human being. now, like, when im crying and someone is there with me, i feel safe and comforted...but it doesnt help me DEEP DOWN INSIDE, where i really need it. and He did that (in my own thinking), b/c he wants me to just TRUST him. why can i trust ppl when they've let me down before, but i cant fully TRUST God?? you would have thought that i would have learned by now--but hey, im stubborn, and we ALL know it heh. so my resolution, goal, and prayer is to stop worrying about the future, take one day at a time, and not trip about things that dont really matter. pray for me guys--thanx.
