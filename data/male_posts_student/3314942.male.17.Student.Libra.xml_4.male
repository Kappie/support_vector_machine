First Off, the PIXIES ARE PLAYING...second off, THE FUCKIGN FLAMING LIPS ARE PLAYING... im really excited two of my favorite bands in same fucking concert will be amazing. I leave for college the 19th I think, so its going to be my last real time with my brother for a long time.   Thats all for today... my shoes are really comfortable no school tommorow because of Metropolitan Museum of Art trip with school.... i say things are pretty fantastic at the moment rock on
