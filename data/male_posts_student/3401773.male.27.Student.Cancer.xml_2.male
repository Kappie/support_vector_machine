I'll tell you one day all about how EQ paradoxically changed my life for good and for bad. Until then, you can browse the news archive to see the l33t talk of loots obtained and battles won (in that order) and visit the public forums to see how not so l33t people chat to the guild members of Mortalis on an infrequent basis.  I shall summaries EQ for you for now before you draw any illusions of the game being remotely interesting.  It stinks; To be content in the world of EQ you need to spend more time playing the game than any clinically sane person would spend watching the TV, going out for walks, socializing at a normal level (non-virtual) or even going to work. This game needs a bigger warning sign on it than tobacco because it quite simply kills your real life.  That aside, if you're only looking for a bit of role-playing fun a couple of times a week then this game can also satisfy those desirse too. It caters for a whole range of player types, just that unfortunately it can lead to OD, as I shall explain another day.  I enjoyed putting the site together and hosting it. I enjoy producing a community environment and pleasing people with the sites aesthetic and functional characteristics. This month (June 04) i shall be revaming the style of the site and removing alot of the JavaScript and DHTML features which in totalaty caused the homepage to load slowly.  I am also publishing some new sites over the next couple of weeks and shall make those publicly known when they are fully up ;)
