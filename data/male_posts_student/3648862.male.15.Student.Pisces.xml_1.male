They had become very tired and decided to stay at an inn for the night. The only room that was available had only one bed. They took it reluctantly, but they were so tired it really didn’t matter.  When they got to the room Goku went immediately to the fridge. It was empty and Goku started to complain. “Food, must have food, give me food”. Hakkai really started to get annoyed so he threw a book at Goku. “If you’re a good little monkey I will get you some food in the morning. Goku rubbing his head says “I am hungry now and whats ‘good little monkey’ supposed to mean?” Hakkai look at Goku with a glare in his eye “you will find out tonight”. Goku gets worried “I will sleep on the floor tonight, your creeping me out a little.” Hakkai starts to freak out a little but he does not show it. He has a secret crush on Goku and thinks this would be the perfect chance to hit on him. “There’s not enough blankets, you’re going to have to sleep on the bed with me. I promise I won’t do anything funky.” Goku reluctantly replies “Ok whatever just get me food in the morning and I’ll do whatever you want me too.” Hakkai’s heart jumps a little he’ll do whatever I want him too, this could get interesting. They both strip down to their boxers and hop into bed. - To be continued  Ok it’s a start; it’s my first fanfic so don’t blame me if it’s bad. I am going to bed cause I got to play at graduation tomorrow. TTYL
