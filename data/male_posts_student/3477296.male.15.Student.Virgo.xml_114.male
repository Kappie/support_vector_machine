As one has guessed, sport plays an integral part in today's society. This is exemplified by the hordes of people gathering in their respective cultural centres for yesterday's thrilling final. Those who can not play sport or unable to successfully integrate it into their lives are miserable people. Whether soccer, tennis, basketball, rugby of all kind, etc, sport is an invocation of emotion. Take Wimbledon. Federer and Sharapova are Champions. Just see them at the end of their matches. It is an example of pure ecstasy and joy. As much as one can criticise the misdemeanours of sport, one can not criticise the goodness and positive emotion it brings to people around the world. To break this seemingly random blog, I state two things, unsurprisingly from the arena of sport.  Andy Roddick after Wimbledon final against Federer at All England Club: "I threw everything and the kitchen sink at him (Federer), but he went to the bathroom and got the tub." Andy Roddick at press conference: "Is she (Sharapova) going to wear a long skirt or a short skirt? I wish I was champion so I could go to the party...Uhhh, I guess I'll just crash it anyways."  Sport also brings a state of humour that would otherwise be unachievable in the daily drudgery of our lives. (You have to say Roddick is pretty funny). It also embellishes a side of goodwill and gracious defeat. It lets out all the "BOOHOOs" (Cristiano Ronaldo crying after the defeat of Portugal in EURO 2004 Final), while also bringing sheer adulation and delight ("King Otto" embracing his successful troops in EURO 2004 Final).  Hopefully, some anti-sportarian will read this and permanently remove his/her negative beliefs against SPORT. With the consuming media nowadays, one usually only sees the negatives of sport, e.g. drugs in athletics and cycling, etc. It is sad to view hundreds upon hundreds disgust sport, as much as one disgusts school. The time of change is upon us. No longer will we live in an age which constantly condemns sport, no longer will we be brainwashed by the despicable tactics of the media. Tonight, marks the era of change, when the underdogs will be crowned champions, when more people will participate in more sport and when people will embrace sport, not deny it from their lives.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On a totally differrent note, does anyone want to organise something in the holidays? I was thinking Zone 3 and then we could all crash at Andy's house (like one obviously does). Getting drunk is up to you ;) (Note: I do not condone any alcohol of any kind...except 5 COUGARS THANX!!!)   If you are still reading this....well, you have plenty of spare time. Im disappointed Portugal didnt win. Im disappointed Ronaldo didnt slot that chance at goal in. Im disappointed that Manly consistently lose by something to 50. Im disappointed everyone says Spiderman 2 is bad. Im disappointed that I couldnt watch or listen to EURO 2004 Final. Im disappointed that I didnt get Shrek 2 on DVD. Disappointed seems to be the word of the day for me. Boredom also sets in terrifingly quickly. I think I will stop now...Im sure I have definitely bored and disappointed all of you.   May life be beautiful and joyous.
