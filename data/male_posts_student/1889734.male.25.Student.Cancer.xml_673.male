The 'journalist' is a Noam Chomsky-reading-22-year-old-canadian-socialist who tries to get some anti-American action from a member of some band I've never heard of.  I took the time to read the entire interview, and it was well worth it.  It's always fun to see 'public figures' respond in gruff language.  You don't get these types of interviews on Fox or CNN.  BW "This next question is controversial so I'm letting you know before we proceed. Some political analysts have articulated the view that what happened on September 11 was justified due to America's presence in the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia. Some political analysts view it as retaliation for what the US has done in the Middle East in the past. As a Canadian, I'm interested in hearing what you have to say about this view that's been put forth by analysts."  JS: "No, it wasn't justified. Not at all. And anybody who says so needs to have their fuckin' head examined."  BW "Do you think 9/11 will be viewed as the first event in the US empire's decline and fall?"  JS: "No. This is not an empire, first of all. If the United States was an empire, your country would be our 51st state."  BW "I understand."  ...  BW "So you don't see the Bush regime as being cultural imperialists? You don't see them as trying to force the American way of life on to a nation that maybe doesn't want it?"  JS: "No. If you think that's true, then why are 70 or 80 percent of the people are thrilled to have us there. Have you not seen that? And it's not a regime, by the way. You keep up that kind of language I'm going to end the interview right now."  BW "Ok. I understand."   JS: "I'm serious."  BW "I'm sorry. It's just my Canadian bias I guess."  JS: "Yeah, it is your Canadian bias. I'm sure it is."
