I really only think it   starts   now, because when you grow up, you'll still have to deal with the same things, maybe to a lesser extent, but..... it's there. Then when your old, and can see death's shadow, you STILL have to face that because you complain your bananas aren't runny enough, or your viagra isn't working.  Oh, and the  fights . It always sucks to get into, or even see fights, physically or verbally, mentally, any kind of dispute between you and your friends, or family for that matter. A few " unmentioned " friends, just got into a "dispute" over a rumor which who knows how, or who started it. I mean, if they all  talked , they could see it's just a  misunderstanding  on everyone's part.. But hey..  We're teenagers!
