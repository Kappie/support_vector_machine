I cleaned my room and had to clean my house because my cousin flies in tonight and my mom has ocd. Now my room is clean, and everything is good. I am enjoying Judge Judy right now, as I wait for my mom to come pick me up and take us to the airport to get Jeana. I wonder where I'm gonna go for dinner tonight? This is how bored I am...I have to register for the SAT too....gotta do that. Mmm...college is fun.  I'm bored, tired, and not in the mood...Good night team.  *EDIT*  Just got home from the airport. It was good. We stopped in Tacoma and went to eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory. It was yummy. I love that place. We got lost as we were trying to find it so we had to call 411 like three times. But we got there. Downtown Tacoma is kinda cool looking. I didn't hate it. So tomorrow is a big day. I have to wake up early, go tan, get my hair did, then take senior pics. Wish me prettiness! G'nite.
