Gotta say, although I really like it, it's not shifted my alleigance in terms of my favourite of the Big 3 being Led Zepplin. The Big 3 of course being Iron Maiden, Led Zepplin and Deep Purple. But still, nice to have Smoke on the Water and some other songs. Might try and convince tout le NJAN to do Smoke on t'Water, cause it's one of those songs that once the audience are a little quieter, all you need to do is make the guitar play the opening and they love it. Ruleage.  I was sorting through my CDs today, actually. Never knew how much dust there was on my old CDs. *coughs*. I managed to find a CD I made when I was younger and more foolish and downloaded a lot of music, and I think I'm entitled to own this CD now; all of the tracks on there I either own or have ordered and haven't got yet because it's out of stock (ie. the only tracks I don't own on an album are those on the Sonata Arctica album Silence, which has been on order for 2 years). Oh, apart from the 2 from the FF9 OST. Like I'm going to fork out Â£40 for a grand total of about 2 properly original tracks. They make an awful game, they can expect to be screwed over by me.  Read Patrick's blog and discovered that I am apparently a "legend". I think that's one of those "go me" moments. Perhaps something that's slightly less "go me" is that, despite my best intentions (getting up before midday), I didn't actually manage to do my papers today. I had intended to do them yesterday, but somehow I managed to get phoned by N'omi at 8:15PM... and not get off the phone until about 1AM. Possibly slightly too strange for me to kinda understand that one. *sighs* I have too many women in my life and too little idea what's going on with any of them. Go me.  I need to take Shez's belt back at some point... I might do that in a bit, I feel like a walk. Je ne sais pas. Never thought I'd say this but I'm bored out of my skull. Apart from coursework (no, I'm not doing that, buffoons) I've got sod all to do. And feeling guilty about it. I've actually done my piano practice, and I'd do some trombone practice but I've got nothing to practice, apart from techniques and when I'm bored doing that seems to seem to be counter-productive. Listening to all the music I've ripped onto my PC - 346 tracks - to try and pass some time. You know, 23 hours worth of time. If you don't count the Classic FM Mag. CDs, then I've burned all my CDs bar about 6. I think 4 of those are box set ones.  As I wander out of the door each day to phaff around at various locations, rarest of all to actually do anything worthwile, I notice in the window of The Vine a set of pictures, taken rather clumsily during an early rehearsal for Les Mis. And despite the fact I was sexy 2 days ago, I look absolutely awful in those. Seriously, the amount I look bad has to be seen to be believed. Ie. I'm not going to let any of you see it. Bwahaha.  I was thinking, you know the song from Les Mis, "A Little Fall of Rain"? Well, there's the oh-so-wonderfully-sweet last line "And rain will make the flowers grow." It crossed my mind that manure ALSO makes the flowers grow.  Quote of the day: "No-one was born to be a slave, Seek the past, and place the blame, Tell me the colours of the rain, No-one was born to be a master. In this land, we live, we die, Brace the oneness, brace the lie, To bind a ring around the fakir We will need a true rain maker."  From Sonata Arctica's   Power of One   Love, Jon Roskilly
