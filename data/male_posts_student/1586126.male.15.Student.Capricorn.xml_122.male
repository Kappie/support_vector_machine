It kicks so much ass, hes got a spiked mohawk and long sleeved shirt, and and and... im making more characters, which i suppose would comopose like, his friends or something, and theyre all punks, and theres a loser who is like a bouncer/enforcer, becuase i really hate them, cuz they dress like sissies and act a little too over the top of tuff. Im thinking about adding more stuff to it.   so long amigos dee doo   Against all authority Freedom  Everyday i listened to you and nothing's ever good enough you're always complaining about something you act so goddamn tough but all you ever do is let someone do your thinking for you and you have no respect for my opinion well at least i think for myself i`m not brainwashed to think like people that rule i'm not a pool and i'll rise i wont compromise and i'll never give up, i won't walk walk walk away there won't be another day when i can say hey hey hey... freedom you talk to me i see your lips move but the words that come out aren't yours they're someone elses you dangle from their strings beneath the wings of the eagle you push but i'll never fall i'm not the only one whose willing to stand up.. we've had enough your laws just benifit you we watch you get richer as we get sicker and we'll rise with battle cries and we'll never give up WALK WALK WALK AWAY THERE WILL BE ANOTHER DAY WHEN I CANT SAY HEY HEY FREEDOM HEY HEY HEY
