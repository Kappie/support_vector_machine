Literally,it means River  lake.That is something I don't understand.  As you can see from the title,Swordsman 2,its the sequel to the movie,swordsman.The sequel is set around the Ming dynasty and is about a swordsman ,Lin Wu Chung and his comrades from the Wah Mountain Sect who decide to travel to Ox mountain to retire from the pugilistic world and lead a life of recluse after being betrayed by their master(their master went power crazy and was obssessed with the kuay4 hua1 bao2 dian3 which is the infamous wushu manual that has the secret of invincibility,which unfortunately is castration).But unfortunately,before they can reach their destination,they get tied up with matters of the pugilistic world (jianghu) again and 5 of the brothers get killed.LinWuchung is unable to retire from Jianghu as his enemies are afraid he would exact his vengeance upon them one day.He has then no choice but to re enter the pugilistic world and kill DongFangBuBai who he has fallen in love with after mistaking   him  for a woman.DongFangBubai is the guy who castrated himself in order to learn the kuay hua bao dian so that he can overthrow the Ming Dynasty and rule over the Han people who have oppressed the Miao minority(his race).   "The seas laugh,lashing on both shores carried in the waves,only me and now...  -Xiao Ao Jiang Hu (briefly translated into english probably means 'mocking the pugilistic world')  Reminds me of the sec IVs who are going to pass out from the unit real soon.   urlLink THe Movie Review is Here
