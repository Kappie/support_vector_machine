As you might know by now, Novell has bought Ximian and SuSe Linux, then there are two large Linux distributors, RedHat AES and SuSe. Novell has gone more and more away from its own Unix clone, NetWare, they are going for Linux buy all means ;) Sun on the other hand, they are working close to evil Microsoft, and are also going mainly for their own Unix clone, Solaris. If Sun buys Novell, they do also get the rights to SuSe and Ximian, the can then focus mainly on Solaris, and SuSe is then going to be left behind. But, on the other hand, many rumors has gone now, telling about Sun thinking about making Solaris GPL, and if they do so, they might wan't to focus on Linux, and put the best from Solaris into Linux ;) But thats very unlikely to happen.
