Please note that I'm not particularly saying this to anyone, except my family members who may occasionaly borrow it without my permisson.  Oh and of course, this is rather predictable, my sister says she will get one that is the same except that it is smaller, slimmer and can record sound. I shall leave my readers to judge what kind of message I am trying to put across.  Tomorow school is going to reopen, finally a day when I can really write something that is related to school. I wonder how it will be like? Most likely chinese will be involved. I haven't passed up both my files (pure forgetfulness, not never do okay?) and I haven't done my story book review yet that was given in the june holidays actually. I shall do a quick ppt. slides on the book review today, hopefully I can snitch some marks for that.  To all those people reading this, work hard to get what you want, and you will get it. But first you must identify what you want, how to get it, and think about how much you want it, so as to motivate you to get what you want. I got my digital camera out of my savings, and though this may sound corny, go out there and fufill YOUR dreams (er, non-dirty dreams).  Pardon me for being nasty for a few seconds but according to Ervina's site, Weili = Hamtaro???? Oh dear... Better not say anything, or else get whacked by Ervina.
