Noticed earlier why there has been a lot of wasps around, we located the nest, in the abestos things on the ceiling of the balcony next door. I personally don't mind them, in fact I happen to like wasps, but others don't, and for good reasons, on person living in the area is allergic to wasps, and a lot of small kids play out there on the balcony, hopefully, the people next door will call pest control about that.  We came across a lead model of a dragon the other day when looking for something, it was broken into three pieces, I had them sitting on my shelf yesterday, and decided today I would try and put them together...damn, Epoxy Resin didn't work on the blasted thing! The rear part of the dragon (hindlegs and tail) won't attach to the wings and front, as the pieces are too heavy for epoxy resin to work. Given up on that for now...  I got a few projects to complete...still got to call up the St. Thomas centre and arrange transport to the Excelsior on the 22nd of July...and to give them my passport number to put on my application...couldn't put it on myself when i sent it as I hadn't even got the forms sorted then!  I am making progress on learning to use Photoshop, in attempting to make light rays, I have detrmined I am okay as long as I select where I don't want the rays to be...lol...just my luck, things always harder than they seem. Must be me...  I got Outlaws working on the computer...thats the easy one, now to get Quake working, it doesn't seem to want to work, either with DOS emulators or Windows XP...games...I really hate them (not really!)
