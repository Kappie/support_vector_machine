"What if the world were colourless?"     I mean think about it...............air is colourless.............but we cant see air............you cant say black or white or grey.........cos those are colours too in a way..........they reflect certain lightwaves and absorb some to produce the colour........so if the world were colourless, what would we see? we wouldn't be able to see objects.......also colour is relative to the surrounding objects............  example, if let's say u look at a white canvas..............u are looking at air which is colourless rite? so if let's say the canvas and evrything else is colourless too........so what can u see?  i still find an answer to this question..............the nearest answer i can get to is we'll only see silhouettes..........just outlines of objects.........but even that doesnt really seem to click cos you need a coloured background to see a silhouette..........but there's no colour in the background!
