What is the world coming to lah! wah lau! You know how freaky that is?! crap... it means ah... you can't say anything about anyone and anywhere unless you seriously want to die lah! haha... but... oh well... i still refuse to censor much of my stuff, cause... i haven't done anything of the sorts... even if i do bitch about anyone, i tell that person up straight! so... yeah... but to everyone out there, be careful of what you say ok? You don't know who might be reading your blog!  haha... anyway, i am feeling better now lah... cause, at least now i do know more or less what has happened and what has resulted in the relationship or situation between Kelly and me... yup... somethings, i won't say lah... especially, since it's more or less a thing kept between us... but... all i can say is that... at least, i do know more or less how she feels about me... yup...  Oh btw... Chris tagged and said to ignore people who gossip about me... well... i can't really say much about it lah... except that, it's really these gossips which are for good old entertainment that may have cost me from having a serious relationship... Thank you very much! Please lah... i don't mind if people gossip about me, but serously, don't take it to far... and to those who have committed this offence... be careful or watch out! if i find out who you are, i seriously don't think i will let you go scorned free... but... than again... i might... cause... forgive and forget... just remember this everyone! Although gossiping may well be fun and entertaining to some of you, think of the consequences and impact it might have on other people 1st! Not to say that i don't gossip, but, at least, i do know the limit and i STOP!  Ok... that's about it for now except for a bit of whining! ARGH! man... i guess today wasn't a very good day for me at all! From the moment of waking up, till now, i haven't had a smooth time! 1st of all, i woke up late! Half an hour late! than, as i stepped out of the house, i sprained my leg simply cause my mum forgot to put away her shoes properly! Argh! bad right?! haha... ok... next, had E8 and damn i failed my assignment! it fails as if my terms are just doomed to suck lah... i always had hope of doing ok for my E8, but now that i see my assignment, the hope feels so flushed down the drain... Oh well, moving on... i had PE next, and wth! we got scolded for no rhyme of reason! we were playing badminton at the concourse and spilled over onto the road, but... even though we knew it was stupid, a PE teacher said it was ok so long as we kept a look out for each other... a few minutes later, we got caught by another PE teacher and got punished to run 6 rounds even though we explained! ARGH! bloody hell! this was a bad day, anyway... if that wasn't bad enough?! i sprained my other ankle on the last round! 2 bad ankles + a bad back = NO BASKETBALL!!! ARGH... damn it! i so wanted to go for training lah! but... Alas... it just can't be... *sigh* at least i spent constructive time writing the reflection letter for Mr Lynn as i waited for my firend, Jill to complete her PW work, before we headed back together... and... NO!!! There is NOTHING going on between us! When i got home, i got into an argument with my parents over Math tuition... ARGH! what a wonderful day right?!  Oh well... no matter what, we still have got to keep our heads up right?! erm... actually, it would be right to agree... but... i am desperately trying to convince myself too! so yeah... anyway, i really hope that my injuries would heal soon and well... everything would get better... especially with regards to my academics and my relationship aspect! yup... i feel so drained, so tired... how am i going to give my blood tomorrow?! ARGH! i hope i'll be all ok and alright soon! haha... ok... anyway, the thing i hope to work out the most now is my relationship problem... to think that 1 phrase of 'just forget about me' could turn the whole situation around into something that both of us didn't really want... oh well... ok... but, as to who that is concerned, guess lah... i am not giving any clues, so don't bother asking! Yup... ok... Keep your chins up and keep smiling! Live Life To The Fullest! ;p
