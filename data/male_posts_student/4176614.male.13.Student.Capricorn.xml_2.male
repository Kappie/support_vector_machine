This is an outrage. What does Christ think of this? I certainly don't find any passages of Scripture that says God winks approvingly at this disgusting stuff. In fact, Just the opposite is true. For example:  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Do you know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  See right there? Jesus Christ  forbids  the immoral, homosexual, prostitution. (Or heterosexual, for that matter.) Also,  Jeremiah 2:20-22 Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, 'I will not serve you!' Indeed, on every hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine? Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, declares the sovereign LORD.  The meaning of this Scripture is obvious. Prostitution, and other types of perversion is in rebellion against the Lord our God. Let's look at one more Passage. (If you've made it this far.)  Ezekiel 16:15-19 But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. You took some of her garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they ever occur. You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. Also the food I provided for you - the fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat - you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the sovereign LORD.  Think about this. Just as the second Passage, this one says clearly that male prostitution is pure evil.  Pornography and Prostitution are, essentially, the same thing. Porn sites solicit sex, usually in it's most brutal form, and that is the definition of prostitution. Also, Idolatry and prostitution often go hand in hand, as seen in the 3 Passages I've shared with you.  I understand if you have made it this far, you'll want to write me, perhaps in agreement, perhaps in blind fury and hatred. It is because of the latter possibility that I cannot allow this to be possible. I will not leave an E-mail address, nor will I allow comments.
