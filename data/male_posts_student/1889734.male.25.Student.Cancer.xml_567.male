After the wailing and moaning about Bush making time to testify in front of the 9/11 commision (a commision DEMANDED by the Left), two of the Democrats leave the Q session early?    I think this illustrates that the 9/11 commision is just another political tool, used to pick apart the president and is not at all serious about trying to find out how 9/11 could be prevented in the future.    If Bush had the power, he should dissolve this commision and start over with serious people.  Appoint non-politicians, business leaders, security experts, military officers, whatever.  The commision DOES have a serious purpose, but when you have people sitting on the commision that had direct involvement with setting policy that hampered the ability of the FBI and CIA to share information (Jamie Gorelick, ex Dep AG), it is nothing more than a farce.
