Seriously, Chad is worn out and has not had many insights lately, just attending the mundane tasks of the day, eating smart, walking 4 miles a day and awaiting a check in the mail from Uncle Sam.  These "ordinary days" are the ones most difficult to be faithful, Satan's schemes are sometimes subtle, all of these things I attend to, while important do not constitute me or my calling as a Christian.  During the chaos of the past few weeks, my prayer life was vibrant and urgent, now "normality" has crept back in, my prayers have been weak and sparse, the greatest comfort is Christ and he alone.  I am thankful for his unconditional love as opposed to my conditional love for him.  I am thankful for repentance, the urging plea Christ makes to us to leave all of this junk we strive after and take his yoke to have life which truly worth being called life.   1TH 3:6 But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you. 7 Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith. 8   For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord .  9 How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you? 10 Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.      1TH 3:11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. 12 May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. 13 May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.   Also, some very glorious news, My father is home and resting well, as is my mother, please continue to pray for them as well!!!!!!!!!!!!
