Its a group project work (as usual) and guess how many members we had? Not 4 but twice that. Yep, 8!!! The maximum she allowed was 6 but we managed to bargain with her and ended up with 8 people. So now, our game board size is doubled (it was originally the size of a desk). Lotsa work to be done yo...   Man, tomorrow will be one eventful day... I have to go for the aquathlon and right after that, the Canon signing ceremony... Stupid taf club teacher made us compete in the non-competitive event. 1 person has to run 1 round barker rd n 1 person has 2 swim. Of course, Iamthe one who will be swimming. Tomorrow, Im also in charge of the canon digicam booth together with some frenz... I'll have to be familiar with the Canon Powershot A8O (the one which im gonna buy) and the pictbridge direct printer Canon CP-220... Bah! At least Im not doing ushering (omg, sooo booorrrring)... Ooooh, gonna have a sleepless nite 2nite... So nervous...   Oh and I didnt broke or fracture my finger after all... Just a stupid sprain...But it did hurt like sh*t... It doesnt hurt so much now :D
