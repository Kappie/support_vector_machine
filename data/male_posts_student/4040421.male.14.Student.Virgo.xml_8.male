Went to see I, Robot with a friend; it's a pretty good, better than I expected it to be. Apart from that I've been waking up late, chatting until late. If all goes well, I'm going to go see King Arthur, get those blank DVDs I need and buy Red Hot Chili Peppers Live at Hyde Park tomorrow.  And where would we be without another quiz?   urlLink     Not bad, eh?
