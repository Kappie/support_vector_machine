Good more time to write and think. I met a guy I worked with like 7 years ago before I joined the Navy in my art class today. I am happy to see that he has a family and is doing somewhat well. I think I will enjoy this art class this summer. I went to the Clark bookstore and picked up a bunch of supplies. I really want to do weird art projects but I think this is a more structured class.  So anyways, I am slowly returning back to where I belong. It is more of a mental challenge to repress the urge to say hi to people or talk to people or go out of my way to be nice, but in the end, it will pay off. The machine state of Rob will be fully functional...Hopefully soon. Robotic in nature, robotic in emotions.
