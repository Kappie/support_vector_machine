I keep forgetting how to work this stupid thing, so instead you're just getting a random rant about whatever I come up with.  We had an idiot in the Writing Center Friday.  Now, idiots showing up in the Center is not anything extremely out of the ordinary.  With a student-athlete population as high as OU's, there's bound to be a fair percentage of them that's dumber than a box of rocks, and just happened to make it into college because they could play a sport (probably football).  Well, this guy was an idiot for new reasons.  See, we have recruitment tours that come through the place every so often.  It impresses the parents of prospective student-athletes to see the academic services center we have here at OU (which is deservedly impressive--the folks who work here, and I'm not just talking about the Writing Center, are quiet good at what they do).  Anyway, this moron decides to announce to a tour that we have written papers  for  him.  This is patently absurd--we don't write the papers for students.  So it reflects poorly upon us, and I don't like that sort of thing.  Now we are even more limited in how we can edit the papers, because any stuff we were doing that might be considered borderline cheating (such as suggesting words to replace for crappy word choice, something we do quite a bit) we can no longer do.  All because one idiot thought he was being funny.  In reality, he only hurt himself and us.  On top of that, we then had to have a meeting with our boss about this crap, and that was unnecessary, really, or should have been.  I swear, it only takes one fool to reflect poorly upon all student-atheltes.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "2 + 2 = 5"
