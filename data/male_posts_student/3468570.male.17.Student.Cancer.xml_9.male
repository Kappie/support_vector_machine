And further more it was my birthday too~~! Glad the lights came on two hours after the blackout occured too~! =)  Speakin' of the blackout I thought that it was actually a brownout by one of Singapore's pathetic 'por kai' power plants on some crazy remote island like Pulau Senoko I think. But too bad it isn't....and it's those Indonesians' fault! Okay okay...enough of such nonsense ~~ it is too crazy to remember it ever!  About my big day, I forgot about it of course and didn't want to celebrate it~! Birthdays are such lame occasions, and I wonder if they should change it to waste-of-resources day as well. It's really a waste of resources buying a crazy and wasteful large cake to commemerate the event! I'd prefer that a birthday would be passed as a normal one, which shall happen in the near future I guess. And today...looks like Ang insulted my intelligence again~! Some of them must be in league with her against me I suppose so~! ((Maybe I think too much...'kopped' from M.J.))  I wonder if anyone found TV advertisements becoming lamer and cornier these days? And by the way, the Eye for a Girl may be coming soon but at least the bachelor is quite good-looking compared to the Eye for a Guy bachelorette who looks so haggard and horrible that she looks like an 'ah soh' in a swimming pool! (Check 8 days if you don't believe, and the issue was published a few weeks ago~=/)  Seems like I'm too lazy to add in any other language into this post today~~ and I hope to write somemore in future while attempting to juggle my heavy load of work alongside with play such as writin' blogs + written journals. Plannin' to write another story on FanFiction.net~~~but no one will know my pen name...WAHAHAHAHA! Okay, that's lame~! =P  Dropped at Boon Lay MRT station after the excursion, I went to 'shop shop' at Jurong Point, which totally sux~! Not many CD shops are located there, and only a few lousy stores have made their rental there too. Definitely not a place for shopping, except for findin' some anime like Gundam Seed which is a whooping lotsa' there! Plus Western Singaporeans seems more geared to C-pop, and less interested in the beautiful sounds of K-pop  J-pop....which is a pity to know that not many people likes J-pop there. And I broke the law ;)! Eating food on the MRT is so kinda' dangerous that it can even slap you with a five hundred dollar fine, which is so kinda' stupid too~! Nevertheless, I ate, therefore I am. ((Copied le quote from a friend~~))  Too much saliva has been spit out that it's time to end. (K.G. will suffer if she could not withstand la Saliva Batterie Grande de le Alvin!) It's time to conclude, bye!
