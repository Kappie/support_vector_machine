I got a DVD/VCR combo, DVD-R burner, Lucy Show/Dick Van Dyke Classic TV Sitcoms DVD set, Ancient Mysteries of the Bible 5-DVD Set, and DVD-R's, all from "Santa." Addressed from my parents I got a new leather jacket (w00t!) and of course you can't forget the Swiss Colony Chocolates! I am now in the DVD age! That's w00t'd! I got everything I wanted short of a new car! What did you all get? Anyway, all for now. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
