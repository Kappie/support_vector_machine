I've weighed my pros and cons for each of these different outcomes if i decide to do them...its like if i go to this club, then i dont get the same treatment as for this club and if i go to this club, then i our team won't win as many games/matches. One club benifits what fits for my goals as a team...but one club benifits what fits for my goals as an individual...cuz the main reason y i considered leavin shoten is becuz i want to b on a  "team" . I wanted all of my teammates to know their roles and know what they r doin and jus get the job done...i don't have that at shoten right now. But some players r makin the extra effort into improving and working hard to get what they want to get accomplished. I know my efforts this summer during club season wasn't the best cuz after losing in the semi's in high school really made me bitter about vball cuz during the past club seasons, my goal coming to high school was winning C.I.F...but that jus didnt happen...and it sux cuz i've worked hard for what i wanted to get done, but now its all down the drain...and i have to start all over again...and thats the same goal coming into the next high school season...to win C.I.F...eventhough we lost tom and jon...im gonna work even harder to get the job done cuz its basically up to me, david, and brian...the rest are there jus to fill the spots and get the job done...we have to work extra hard to make thingz happen. I've realized my weaknesses and my strong points...i know what i need to work on and i don't think other clubs will help me wit my weaknesses...so i've decided to stay with shoten...for the fall season for sure...no yet decided once the summer season comes. I'm gonna stick wit the same guyz that i've played wit in the past 2 years...and im gonna try my best to improve as a player and to improve my team's "unity" i guess...cuz i don't want to b the only one gettin the job done...i want everyone to do their job and get it done...and thats my decision.     Decision: Staying with Shoten
