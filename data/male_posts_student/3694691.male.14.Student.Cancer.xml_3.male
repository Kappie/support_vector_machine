Hmmm...also I need to phone up 2 American Guys and yell down the phone and send a postcard to one brazilian...it's a tough life being a Gmail swapper :D. Anyways my Uncle stayed over tonight and was very "encouraging" throughout the whole england v. croatia game. I mean he was shouting stuff like: "That goalie looks like Damon Hill!" and "Maybe it;s the squares on the grass confusing them." He's quite funny really...I thought it was a good enough result..4-2 but the match against Portugal will be tricky...I don't know the inns and outs of all the stats of the players or what formations are best, but I do know it should be a good game on Thursday, at least we're through to the ko rounds! New Sbemails out today, thought I'd mention it because it's exceedingly good! Give it a watch sometime... It's getting kinda late now, so I'm heading off to bed, but if you've actually read this it'd be good if you could post a comment, I mean I try and make it intresting. And in other news I'm making a new crappy flash animation, and the trailer of it shall be finished shortly, and as special viewers of my blog I think that you deserve to watch it...an exclusive if you wish. Anyways, I'll update this tomorrow!  Sites Mentioned: http://www.homestarrunner.com                  http://www.gmailswap.com
