Some of the blogs were really cool, like one particular person's one which kept track of his bike journey across some country. But, after extensive, er, research, I think it's safe to assume that blogs fall into three different types of categories:  a)  The Inspiring Blog : These are the blogs which really get you thinking. These blogs amused me for all sorts of reasons, be it for the pictures they included in it, or the descriptive manner in which they wrote it.  b)  The Who, What, Where Blog : A normal type of blog. I guess a good example of it would be mine, where a whole bunch of crap is the main topic. They DON'T encourage any thinking. :-)  c)  The Are You For Real? Blog : These blogs had crap as their main topic too. The difference is, these blogs emphasize exaggeration until the line between fact and myth is sooo blurred...    My Blog?  So, how does my blog stack up against all the others that I've read so far? Well, don't know... I know for one thing that I my language isn't deep. There's no technical jargons involved. Just normal English. There aren't any outpourings of feelings in my blog either. I don't really talk about feelings stuff coz of two reasons: 1) Don't wanna sound like a teenage drama queen... 2) I don't have feelings...(well, actually I'm a mean person...so all I feel is pissed, most of the time anyway)    Fan Factor, not to be confused with Fear Factor  That's another factor... Check out the Blogger website blogs. The best are usually the one's which don't have a whole bunch of loyal supporters viewing them all the time. The ones which do have loyal readers meanwhile, tend to sound more magazine-like than, well, a blog...  And that concludes this edition of "Blog Weekly". Thank you.
