THERE IT IS AGAIN! a white huge ferret just crossed the road. Ok so where was I, ah yes... we played manhunt, it was fun. Then we went home, Mrs. Haley was mad because we had her drive us home at 12. My mom was supposed to originally but she was high and didn't know how to drive... well she wasn't high, but she was pretty tired. So, Matt slept over. Then the next night I slept at Chris'... that was hilarious. There was a senior party across the street and we kept yelling random shit out the window and they heard us and laughed all drunk and crap. Ya, I didn't fall asleep until late... but I fell asleep right away with Matt, which proves Matt is boring and can't keep me awake unlike all my other friends. Chris did this by yelling and making me laugh to the point of bladder explosion. Matt, you gotta try making me laugh, it takes the sleepyness out of me. Oh, and the time I fell asleep under Dan's computer desk, those were the days. So what else happened, ah yes, I got that Gamecube/Gameboy hooker upper... and Tingle makes me laugh hard... I mean really hard. I got mad at my dad today because he was being a homo, I forget why but he was. My sister pissed me off also, she was talking all advanced and mature so I asked her how to catch a pokemon and she replied with "I have no clue." WHICH PROVES I AM SMARTER!!! Come on! Everyone knows how to catch a pokemon, let alone HAVE POKEMON RED! That game and Zelda are the greatest... well Pokemon used to be fun, it sucks now. It got too boring. Ok, now I'm not concentrating on that dum ferret anymore so I'm gonna go sleepy. Bye
