Another long word is Donaudampfschifffahrtgesellschaftskapitänswitwenrente which means 'sailors widow pension at the Donar (a river) shipping company'. I cant say for the German word but the Icelandic one isnt in our regular vocabulary.  Anyway if you have something better to write about... please do  Úlli
