Thanks to a bunch of friends, I was given a fabulous treat to a Vegetarian steamboat buffet at a restaurant at Lavender Street. The dimsum there were also very delicious and mouth-watering. After which, we went to a CAMPUS concert by  Jiang Meiqi  and  Penny Tai . It was actually my FIRST time attending a LIVE concert and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, shouting and screaming like any other idolizing teens! We also caught the new Korean movie, Windstruck. I really enjoyed the hilarious act by both the lead actor  actress! I was especially amused at the "surprise" ending! In my memory, today(Yesterday) was actually the best celebrated birthday of my LIFE!  I seldom celebrated my birthday because it is a constant reminder of being born into this world of suffering and torture(sounds pretty pessimistic). Growing up in a Taoist/Buddhist environment, I believe that everyone is born into this world for a purpose: To repay their karma, irregardless whether it is a bad or good one. However, there are a selected few, such as Mother Theresa, that were born to this world to redeem the sins of Mankind and to attempt to educate to us the  Way of God .   This yearly reflection makes me realize one very important thing as it serves as a ringing alarm that  Time and Tide waits for no Man or Woman . As every second, minute, hour and day passes, our cellular components evolves(or degenerates), our body ages and events are occuring all over the world at an astonishing speed. You may think that your action is of no significance to the world, but think again.  One action is the cause of another and this will result in a chain reaction of events, which is beyond the normal comprehension of Mankind. Your actions are also proof that you are  ALIVE  and affecting the world around you in ways you would never believe you ever could. Such can also be said about the act of doing  NOTHING . So, instead of "waiting for the right time", why not do what you always wanted to  NOW ?
