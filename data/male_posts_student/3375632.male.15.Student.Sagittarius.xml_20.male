Believe.  Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong. Believe.  Think about the love inside the strength of heart Think about the heroes saving life in the dark Think about the chance I never had to say Thank you for giving up your life that day    This is my favorite!!    Sew this up with threads of reason and regret So I will not forget. I will not forget How this felt one year six months ago I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  I can tell that you don't know me anymore It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget And being on this road is anything but sure Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  So many nights, legs tangled tight Wrap me up in a dream with you Close up these eyes, try not to cry All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you Memories of you Memories of you Memories of you    off to cip 2 i go .. presentations to see
