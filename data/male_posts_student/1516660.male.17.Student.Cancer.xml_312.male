Breakfast came. Even the chee cheong fun looks so inviting. Yes! After that, I watched TV, then went out to play basketball with CQ and cats.  Hmm. I reached there around 11.30. HaHa. I played with the cats for about 30 minutes. WQ is extremely dazed. I wonder what's up with him. I only played for 30 minutes, because we stopped playing when WQ's glasses are knocked down and is bent. O.O Yes. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat. WQ and PY had to go out, so they didn't come along.   Okie. We went up to the foodcourt to eat. Hmm. I ate black carrot cake. Yes! Or else, I have no moolah left to drink! Even carrot cakes tastes nice. Joyce gave me her chicken wings because she don't like to eat the wings (Seee WQ! People are so generous! Yes, I haven't forgotten the Fiesta incident! You threw away the wings, refusing to give me!! Oh yes, I still remember, and I will keep on remembering! My wings!!). She's eating the sambal chicken and the sambal sauce is absolutely fantastic! I must eat sambal chicken rice next time! HM joined us. Hello!   After that, we went around shopping. We went up to Metro 3rd level, to shop for bags. I saw Wendy there, but she was busy serving a customer, so I didn't get to talk to her in the end. Hmm. We went down to Guardian, because HM wants to buy things. We played with the Nivea Deodarant (testing can). The smell kinda reminds me of someone. Yes!! After that, we went around lor. Joyce wanted to buy a computer and she asked for my help lor. Hmm. I gave her some advice. After that, we went to take NeoPrints. We took 2 times. O.O In one of the pics, they put a crown over my head and the words "Emperor". Meow moo moo!  Hmm. Me and Gloria went home. Me, CQ and Gloria were very worried for the height and weight taking. We were scared we will end up in the Health and Fitness Club (those who are 130% overweight and above MUST enter that as an CCA)! We don't want! Choir is our ONLY choice!! You know what? Our worries are unfounded. I checked with my Health Booklet. If the info's accurate now (CQ said it is...height-for-weight tables don't change over the years), then all of us are very safe. We are in the 120% region! YAY!! Choir!!   Okie. I came back, bathed and went online. Yes! At 6.30, I went to eat dinner and watch my show. Even ducks are meowing! After eating and watching the TV, I came back online.  Hmm. What else to add? Yes, must do the Student Profile form! The cats are gonna see some pretty interesting answers! I gotta go, so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
