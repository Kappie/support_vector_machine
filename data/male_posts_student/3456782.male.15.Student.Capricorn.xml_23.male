Me : "What's the diameter of the earth?"  Bob : "Well what do you think?"  Me : "If I thought, I wouldn't have asked the question."  Bob : "Remember in science class, when Mr. Vierling was talking about the diameter of the earth?"  Me : "Well obviously not, because I wouldn't be asking you now if I knew what it was."  Bob : "'Member in that movie with Tom Hanks? They were arguing about the diameter of the earth."  Me : "Do you know the diameter or don't you?"  Bob : "And they were talking about how the diameter from pole to pole is smaller than the diameter from equator to-- other equator."  Me : "Just tell me the damn diameter!"  Bob : "7,800 miles."  Me : "Thank you!"  Exeunt   And then there are the people who are overly paranoid.   Me : "What's the diameter of the earth?"  Bob : "Why, what have you heard?"  Exeunt   P.S. As far as I know, there wasn't a movie in which Tom Hanks was talking about the diameter of the earth.
