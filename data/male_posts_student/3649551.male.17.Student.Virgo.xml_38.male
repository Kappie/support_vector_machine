I was in a car with Josh the Philosopher and Krispin the Poet for a few hours, and we were swapping stories about some of our past experiences ... most of them (mis)adventures in romance. We were laughing at each other and having a good time, when I started to realize how necessary it is to laugh at your stupid mistakes in the past. If you really learned something from that stupid thing you did, it should become funny to you. Your past self should seem foolish to you because you're smarter now. You can  see  how dim you were because you learned from it. It's like seeing an old picture of yourself. You laugh because you're thinking, "Why the  hell  did I cut my hair like that?" And it's a good sign if other people laugh at your past self, as well. It shows that they think you're smarter now and that they wouldn't expect you to do something so ridiculous. If you can't laugh at your mistakes, it shows that you're still a bit too stupid to see how stupid you are. It shows that you haven't quite developed beyond that experience, so you can't see the humor in how stupid you were. It's not funny to you: because you're still stupid. I wouldn't be laughing, either. But I'm sure I will later, when I someday read this and think of how much of an idiot I was when I wrote this. Hindsight is arrogant, that way. Of course, if I run around laughing at my past self, I'll probably trip up when I reach the future. It's like walking backward through life. You're inevitably moving in the right direction, but you're looking the wrong way. I'm not one to waste time thinking about the future, but it's always a good idea to glance that way every once in a while. Most of the time, though, I think it wise to either be looking straight down at your feet and focus on the present, or to check the past to make sure you're not repeating some moronic error. The thing about the future is that it's completely undefined and up for grabs. The past has a value that can be determined upon reflection, and the present is when we actually live and make choices. But the future? What does it really have to offer? Uncertainty. Nobody knows, until it becomes the present, at which point it should become our focus. It's like when people talk about the way they might die. Somebody once told me they would never commit suicide because they wouldn't want to 'die like a coward.' I replied, 'I'd be more afraid of living like one.' I think we all die the way we live. If we live fearing death, then we'll die afraid. That's why I think the present should really be our chief concern. TODAY, I am alive. 'What am I going to do with my life?' should be a question about today, not tomorrow. That's why I hate it when people ask me about college and a future career. I'd like to say, 'I don't know ... I'm just trying to decide what to eat for lunch.'
