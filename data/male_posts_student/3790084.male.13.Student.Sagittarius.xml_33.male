At first i dont think so, but after give it a try to listen to it. I found it's a very calming song n very romantic..my mood actually got better when I listened to it.. *winks*  Life is like this also, we never know what we like until we have try it out... So, i think we need to take up every opportunity to try out the new things, new adventure in our life...*nod nod* . yesterday tried out the new " Fruit Tau Fu Fa" Damn...it's horrible.. yuck~~ No wonder my sister not even want to look at it (she is the biggest fan of Tau Fu Fa)... anyway, I got to know how it tastes and i know i dun like it... so next time just dont buy it lor...hehe.. *ermm...*I m thinking to try out wall climbing...I got my chance slipped off my hands 9 yrs ago... hope it's not too late to do it now... There's actually so many things that i wanna do in my life lar.. sighz, sadly time is limited... :(  wahhhh... if i have 48 hrs a day... i wan to spend my time  learning music  (gave up my violin 6yrs ago- wasted the $$ only) now --> guitar (plan to learn by myself..muahah), spend more time on  sports  (badminton,basketball, softbol, cycling, Go- Kart'), then take up  swimming  class (so pity dunno how to swim), involve in  charity work  (always feel like want to help out but dont how to get myself involve..ehhe), learn various different  languages  (eg, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese..), spend 2-3 hrs lepak with  frens  for drinks o somthing, etc But after all, if god give us  48  hrs a day, i think i'll still complaining... heheh... humans.. are always greedy~~
