Well recently my one-year-old 2.0 GHz HP computer decided to start freezing up every time I used Internet Explorer. The thing that pissed me off was that it decided to keep freezing up while I was working on a website for my fathers classic car club ( urlLink Crown City Cruisers ), so I virtually got nothing done after working for almost two hours. Finally I remembered hearing on  urlLink G4TechTV  about an  urlLink Internet Explorer  alternative called  urlLink Mozilla Firefox . After about 10 minutes of downloading, I started up Firefox, and I haven't used Internet Explorer since.  I soon found after downloading Mozilla Firefox that you can download thousands of different extensions, which are basically little programs that customize Firefox to your preference. Browser customization is probably the feature that I love the most about Firefox- something that the communist Microsoft Corporation hates.  Mozilla Firefox is what computer geeks call Open Source, which (as Dictionary.com puts it) is a method and philosophy for software licensing and distribution designed to encourage use and improvement of software written by volunteers by ensuring that anyone can copy the source code and modify it freely. This means that if I wanted to, I could write an extension for Firefox, possibly improve the software for some users, and share it freely. Open Source is the future of computer software, and will probably one day take down large corporations like Microsoft.  If you are interested in Mozilla Firefox, or any other Mozilla products check out  urlLink http://www.mozilla.org  for more information.
