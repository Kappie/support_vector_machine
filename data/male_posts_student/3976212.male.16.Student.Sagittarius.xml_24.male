I havn't eaten out for over a month! I did like twice a month ago, and before that I didn't for like a month before that! I mean, I know my dad doens't have a lot of money, and it isn't that huge of a deal because i'm on a diet (atkins) but when i get deprived of shit like this, it makes me crave it more, which makes me go on binges, which is not fun. I mean, it's fun for like 2 days cause I can eat whatever the hell I want, but a week quickly passes and I realize that I'm laying in bed, eating peanut butter toast..like eww! I don't know about the money issue my dad has with my mom, and he wont tell me..he claims it isn't any of my business...but besides that I don't think it's fair because I am the one going without new clothes, and resturaunt food! And when I moved back in with him I demanded a small allowence to help keep my money balance stable. Nope, he hasn't given me a penny. And, he hasn't made one effort to drive me into Parksville or Nanaimo to look for a job. And that is just like 5% of the issue. He moved me here, and I have no friends here, and as hard as I am trying, I still havn't made any friends. It's really depressing. That's just another small 5% of the issue. The other 90% of the issue is that I just plain can't stand living here! My brother has no respect for me-at all. He is extremely loud, nasty and annoying. He is consistantly bothering me, but I try to ignore him because of the little respect he has for me, and then he goes and tells my dad some bullshit story. My dad is a whole other issue. He doesn't know what I do, and at one point he didn't care. Now he is actually being very, very strange. He says I am "getting worse" as if I was becoming depressed again. I am not getting depressed..I probably will be soon if the damn stress level doesn't decrease. My brother is a trouble maker, he has no friends and causes trouble for something to do. And he can't always deal with the consiquences. Like tonight, he reported me to a nexopia admin and claimed "abuse". So of coarse, I unplug his internet and tell him "you said you would stay off that fucking site". I lock my door by putting a peice of wood behind my tv stand and jams the door (I always do that). About 20 minutes later my dad crashes into my room, pushes my tv stand out of the way, I fall over in my chair crying and he comes and bends over me and screams and screams at me. I don't know about you, but when somebody yells that loud so closely to me, the sound becomes muffled and I cannot understand what he is saying. Sometimes when he mentions something he gets extremely angry because he claims he is repeating himself. I really don't know what he said the first time, and frankly, I really don't give a fuck. I just want to be left alone, they can do their thing, but they can't talk as loudly as they do, I have extremely sensitive hearing (and eyesight, etc) and I cannot handle the stress from the constant fighting. I  would  clean the dishes, vancumm the floors etc, Just ask some of the people I have stayed with in the last few months...even my mom! (actually I don't suggest you talk to her). I just couldn't handle the stress from being in the kitchen for more than 5 minutes. I had the worst headache today, and it's just going away now. I should prolly go to bed now, as it took 20 minutes to write this the actualy time is now 5:13am. blargh.
