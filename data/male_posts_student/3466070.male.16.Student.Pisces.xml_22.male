I worked for him in the past, but he did some dirty business with my parents(charged them for a bad job twice) so I quite and now they are closing down. I get paid $15 bucks for 3 hours of work. Not bad, but I still get to finish up some of the old projects I never got to finish. It was pretty fun, but Taco Bell will pay better.
