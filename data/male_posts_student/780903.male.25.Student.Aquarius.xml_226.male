Apparently, for some people, their entire set of mail stored on the server was deleted.  For others, mail that they sent never arrived at its destination.  Apparently for me, neither have those have occurred -- and, in fact, I received the e-mail saying e-mail was down, so I'm not really sure what it all means.  And the one e-mail of reasonable importance I sent yesterday (regarding a summer job opportunity) got responded to, so I knw it made it to where it was going.  A haiku about e-mail servers going down:   I am lost e-mail I did not get where I'm sent No one will read me
