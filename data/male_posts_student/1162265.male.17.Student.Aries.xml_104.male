Maybe even less then that since I don't really give a damn about the band final because I already got a 78 on it without taking the final.  Whatever, I got another year of being passive under my belt, even though I have that loud aura.  I guess everyone has some social handicap.    I'm going to listen to loud reggea and pretend to be West Indian to feel better.  Because I'm a real raggamuffin fi real fi real. Gotta study for physics though.
