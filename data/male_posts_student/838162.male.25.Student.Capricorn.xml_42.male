Ever been in this sense of limbo where you are totally happy about something and you want to enjoy that feeling, but there is a little something that puts a damper on it? Yep…I feel that way right about now.  I got my new  > up and running and it’s a sweet machine. I would have gotten it up earlier if it wasn’t for the fact that I need to swap the video card, hard disk and even the power supply with my old rig. The installation of Windows XP Pro was smooth, the easiest OS install I ever had frankly and my view of Microsoft has improved just on this fact alone. The OS itself is fantastic and I’ve grown to like it. However it is still Windows and some stuff bug me, like how a high powered rig is needed to run it well, and all those annoying Microsoft apps that I can’t turn off (damn MSN messenger, go away! Stop eating my resources…), well not yet at least.  The damper on the party is that I can’t use all the security features that I wanted unless I use the NTFS file format. But silly me, I was in such a rush that I didn’t do that. So it looks like I would have to reformat and reinstall to get it. Oh well. Good thing I found this out early on but I can’t do it right now since I need to finish up my assignment first. Sigh. Just consider this a learning experience I guess.   >  Wonder about today’s Tag Line? Check out  urlLink Tron 2.0  a follow up on one of my favorite movies, Tron (comes just under Star Wars). The special effects was Way ahead of it’s time back then and the soundtrack is very cool (cyber-orchestral I call it, if there is such a thing) and it’s the only DVD that I own at the moment.
