What makes our firm unique are its fantastic people.  Our attorneys and staff have created a unique firm culture which nurtures mentoring and the exchange of ideas.   We possess a unique combination of experienced lawyers with backgrounds in various legal fields.   Our clients appreciate our unique combination of specialized expertise and broad experience.  Our firm's culture is a unique blend of the conservative and entrepreneurial.   Our exciting practice and unique collegial ambiance distinguish us from other law firms.  We have a unique ability to offer our attorneys unlimited opportunity for personal, professional and financial growth.   We have a unique Pro Bono Policy that demonstrates the Firm's support for pro bono.   There is a unique spirit at work here, a collective "can do" attitude that empowers every member of our Firm.  At our firm, your first reward is the unique opportunity to explore your interests and build your practice.  Our attorneys and staff have a passion for justice and a unique commitment to the needs of our clients.  We don't think you will find another law firm anywhere that has such a unique combination of excellent lawyers, challenging and diverse practice opportunities, decent people, and a genuine sense of community.    One of the things that makes us unique — and uniquely effective for our clients — is that our people live in the real world, not inside dusty law books.  A law student or graduate should be wary of a firm that is one-sided and does not present a balanced mix of quality legal work, people, and lifestyle. We believe we have succeeded in achieving such a balance, which makes us unique in today's legal community.   If the unique firm we have described here is one that appeals to you, we encourage you to contact us about career opportunities.   Note: I've made some minor edits to eliminate firm names and shorten sentences, but these are all real.
