Before you start calling me "Watch-boy" or something to that effect, realize that it's spelled "ROULEX", not "ROLEX." (all punctuation marks inside the quotation marks, how could I forget thanks to my English teacher's pet peeve about the thing.)  Roulex actually comes from ancient history, in the Punic Wars (Say what?  Punic wars?  What's that?)  where he (Roulex) was a mercenary general who assisted the Carthigians (Yes, these guys did get wiped out by the Romans, which is why they arenâ€™t exactly well known.)  Well, I live in New York (the state, not the town,) between 2 towns named Bainbridge and Guilford.  I'm the oldest in a huge family (9 kids including myself,) still in high school, and currently unemployed (looking at this point.)  I like music, virtually any kind, though my favorite bands at the moment (They change) are Skillet, Creed, Thousand Foot Krutch, Switchfoot, and U2.  Movies are cool, especially The Matrix, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings.  I love to read, though I like computer games more.  BTW, read Shogun by James Clavell.  One of the best books of all time (IMHO.)  Computer games... where do I begin?  Baldur's Gate II is probably my all-time favorite, though it is LONG!  Recently been playing Half-Life, Diablo II, and Max Payne.  The reason I chose this layout was actually because it looks kinda like Half-Life's format with the text and all.  Expect from this blog random comments, updates on my oh-so-hated life, and reviews of various stuff I find cool or stupid. Well, until next time...  (Oh, feel free to post comments or insult me here too.)
