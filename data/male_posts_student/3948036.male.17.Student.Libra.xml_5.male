The weather returned to a sunny state after at least 5 days of rain, clouds and utter gloominess. I must say it was perfect for working on my non-existing tan. So I went out on the back porch(which is a brilliant song by The Presidents Of The United States Of America, that I have to remember to listen to tomorrow when i continue my tanning-work-thingy) with a good book and my 80's style sunglasses and it was utter bliss! So even if I get a tan or not, I will still continue to sit on the back porch whenever there's a sun-filled day.  Tanning doesn't come that easy to me. Why? Well I'm a brown/redhead, and I'm told that people with that kind of hair (red especially) doesn't get a tan easily. The results i tend to get is either getting sunburnt and pink, or remain in my pale state(I'm often mistaken for a corpse/vampire when I take my shirt off i.e on the beach), just with a few more freckles added to my collection. But I think that this is the summer where all of that will turn :)  Wish me luck!    As well as this project I've another one which has been going on for the last 2 weeks. Which is mainly to:  Try To Get Healthier!         So I've done a list of things to do each day/week: At least 100 sit-ups and 50 push-ups a day, Eat at least 5 fruits/vegetables a day, and take at least 3 jog/bike-trips a week. I've stuck to this list for, as I said, the last two weeks, and I plan to stick with it out the summer and hopefully when I go back to school as well.    Oof, I'm not at all as happy with this post as when I first wrote it, but what am I going to do?    Feel free to comment if you pass by my blog! It will only inspire me to write more, and maybe I'll get a chance to sneak a peak at your blog as well.    Fo' Shizzle, Karsten.
