Fred wearing aviator sunglasses. [complete with artist's rendering]"  "Fred cont'd wearing them. It was dark! (cloudy)"  "Mooreheadville, PA!"  "3:29 PM. Fred really has to pee. But, rest stop is CLOSED!"  "3:38. Fred's foot tapping to alleviate the pain of his bladder."  "3:41: Fred pulls over on expressway. Pees under bridge!"  "3:48. Fred finishes up."
