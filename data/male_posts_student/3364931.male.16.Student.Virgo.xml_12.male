When they were explaining why there was a climate shift i was like "huh ??" but when the show continues you'll roughly understand what the hell they are talking about, so no worries there.The show was thrilling and suspenseful so not much boring dialogue, more on the action and people running and screaming which is what i like best in movies (im no sadist). There was one part where the wolves were looking for food, and they jumped out of the room and nearly hit one of the actors (have yet to find out his name)and that really got me.I actually shouted...hahha...sorry annabelle ! haha...erm...and another part was the freezing of the temp and there were like running here and there....that was cool too... overall the movie was superb and i'm watching it with my mum again later tonight i think, can't wait ! so if you're still thinking of watching it, let yours truly,the movie guru,tell you: catch it now !  Movie Grade: 85% pros: The SFX (special effects) are great, the chaos even better. cons: The show should be more realistic man ! Five or Six hurricanes destroying Downtown Los Angeles ( Plus the one erasing the sign "HOLLYWOOD")? give me a break lah ! and the SFX usuage is really obvious, so minus points for that.  Who should watch: sadistic people, disaster inclined people, Psychos, people looking for eye-candy actors Who should not watch:people who screams when there are exciting scenes, people who cant shut up,people who do not know anything about global warming
