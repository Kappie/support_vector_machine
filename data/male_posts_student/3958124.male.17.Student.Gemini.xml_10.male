Very goofy indeed.  Around 7 Jeremy picked me and Travis up. Chris and Liz came too. The traffic was Xtreme, Jeremy managed to make someone so mad, they turned their brights on him. Bastards. Jeremy ran in and got the tickets for us and we went to Toys 'R Us, biatch. As any high school age kid might, we headed straight for the toys on wheels.  The movie "the butterfly effect" was great.  Hopefully i'll post some more inspired news when someone calls me and gets me off my ass
