Everytime he does it, my whole face turns red and tears fly out of my eyeballs! STOP JOE! Elisa - Um... excuse me, wolfman? lol We saw a jazz show today, pretty cool. Rob's buddy icon is scary... it's a picture of him all evil and tough and Mr. Cool Big Monster. I forgot to mention the other day in lunch, this kid Mark walked around the whole cafeteria without knowing where he was going. He even asked the Etheopian custodian for directions! I miss Charlie, he isn't in our lunch period anymore. Maybe he got fired for promoting us to throw out the red plastic lunch trays. In SS, we spent the whole class talking about Mr. Madeiras' wife. On the bus ride home, I said bye to the bitch Amanda H who should seriously burn in hell for being unhappy and evil. There's two kinds of people that suck, the people that are always sad and evil AND the people that are NONSTOP happy even if you burn their house down... their still happy... stupid Canadians. Who the hell's Canadian in this country anyways? So anways, I said bye to Amanda and this guy behind her gave me a light brush on the neck and said "Don't fucking say anything!" I think he was gay... he kind of gave me a gay stroke. )= I think he thought... woah I sound like the fat dude from Mickey's Christmas Carol, I think he thought I was Chris B, the kid who hugged her and got yelled at by her. Our new bus driver is cool... at first I thought he was really old smoking women but then I heard his low voice so I relized it was Ms. Thiele! I think he was a hippy. I got home, didn't get what I wanted. So... I just did nothing the rest of the night. Well... I talked to Amanda G's sister... is that considered doing something? Oh ya, I played Nintendo non-stop.
