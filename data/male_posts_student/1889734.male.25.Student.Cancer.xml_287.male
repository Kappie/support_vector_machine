That I am usually singulary obsessed with one idea or concept, and when the slightest crack or slow down appears, a new obsession leaps in and the old one is gone instantly and entirely.  And it is rare when an obsession appears twice.  Interesting.  Interesting and correct.  I wonder if this is a result of the "more info now, faster, hey, you blinked, here's some more information" culture that is producing children with attention spans that can only be measured in physics labs...   No need for comment, I am just "obsessed" with this thought today, and also thought that the phrase "perpetually obsessed" could become clinical??
