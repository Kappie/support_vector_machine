Cuz you get all the fresh air and you see all these people and you get to ride around and stuff, and its really fun.  So yeah! On to more important things, like how FRIGGIN SWEET Warped Tour '04 was!  You have no idea, unless you were there also, then you would probably have a pretty good idea... So yeah, I got a backpack full of free stuff, which is always awesome.  An ass-load of free stickers, some posters, and a bunch of sampler CDs.  So yeah, the line-up that I saw was something like this: chronic Future, From Autumn to Ashes, Motion City Soundtrack, Matchbook Romance, then after Matchbook we walked around getting free stuff for about an hour and a half, and listening to small bands music, and buying CDs and such.  Then we hit up the two main stages (Teal and Brian) for the rest of the show.  The line up was something like this: Coheed and Cambria, New Found Glory, Flogging Molly, Story of the Year, Yellowcard, NoFX, and then Sugarcult.  We headed out after Sugarcult, cuz we were all spent and hot and tired and were ready to get on the road.  On the way out I stopped and listened to another small bands CD, and they were really good.  It was hardcore and I usually don't like hardcore that much, but it was kinda melodic hardcore instead of just like, bash your face and don't play music hardcore, so it was cool.  I wanted to get their CD but I only had like, 4.50 left over.  He said he woulda given it to me if I had a few more bucks, but he was really nice about it and he was a totally cool guy so I gave him a dollar for his beer money donations box.  It was great.  While waiting out in the parking area for my mom, we chilled and listened to Taking Back Sunday and Bad Religion rock the crowd.  So yeah, yesterday was the best day of my summer.  We upheld the 2 year long (and running) tradition of eating at Wendy's on the way home.  We even sat in the same booth... haha.  Yeah so when we got home we kinda sat around in my room for a while listening to some of the music we got, then they all headed out.  I was so tired.... so yeah, that my friend, is what Warped Tour '04 was all about.  Awesome music and hanging out with friends.  See you guys later!
