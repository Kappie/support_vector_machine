Garciaparra will be a free agent next season and many people think that he wants to head west to a team like the Angels or the Dodgers, so he can live a nice lifestyle with his wife Mia Hamm. Both Anaheim and Los Angeles are very active in acquiring a player like Nomar hoping he will be the final piece to their World Series roster. The big debate has been to trade, let Nomar sign with another team, or sign him. Now let's explore all three possibilities.   Trade Many trade possibilities have surfaced during last offseason including a deal that would have sent Nomar to the White Sox in return for the 5-tool center fielder Magglio Ordonez. This trade would have proven wrong the theory that Nomar wants to go to California to play ball and it also doesn't make too much sense for the Red Sox. Johnny Damon has been a stable leadoff hitter at center field for the Sox and has recently become a fan favorite with his Jesus-like looks. A trade to Los Angeles makes much more sense for the Red Sox. The Sox have made it clear that they are going to go for pitching during late July and what better place to acquire pitching than Los Angeles. Last year, there were trade rumors involving Odalis Perez and with his contract running up at the end of the year there is going to be even more rumors. Odalis Perez has posted a 4-3 record so far this season along with a nice 2.88 ERA in 14 starts and seems to be a good fit with the Red Sox. Another team in the hunt for Nomar would be the Anaheim Angels. The Angels had a big offseason by signing Vladamir Guerrero, Bartolo Colon, Jose Guillen, and Kelvim Escobar, but their not stopping now. The Angels have a stacked minor league system including third baseman Dallas McPherson, first baseman Casey Kotchman, catcher Jeff Mathis, and pitcher Ervin Santana among others. If the Red Sox want to deal Nomar for prospects remains to be seen, but if they do than it's likely thatâ€™s where Nomar will end up. If Nomar is traded than Pokey Reese will likely move to shortstop and Bellhorn would occupy second base. Trading Nomar may really hurt the Red Sox chances at a World Series title, but it might have to be done.  Releasing Nomar Letting Nomar go would probably be the worst case scenario for the Red Sox. Although it may help bring a championship home this year, it would hurt the Red Sox in the long run. Some critics have also proposed the idea to move Nomar to second base and groom Pokey Reese into our shortstop of the future. Let me be the first to say that this idea is pure ludicrous. Nomar is one of the best defensive shortstops hurt or not and the Red Sox would be insane not to put Nomar at shortstop. The Red Sox may be able to let Nomar go, just not now. The Red Sox #1 organizational prospect is a 5-tool shortstop named Hanley Ramirez, probably won't be ready for the majors until 2006. The Sox first pick in the 2004 Amateur Draft was also another shortstop named Dustin Pedroia. It seems like the Red Sox are preparing to let Nomar go, but not just yet.  Resigning Nomar Signing Nomar seems to be the most logical thing to do. Nomar is only 30 years old, even though it seems that he is past his prime hitting the baseball, he's still a top 3 shortstop in the league. Having Nomar at shortstop would keep the Red Sox World Series hopes alive for years to come. Nomar has said before that he would like to stay in Boston and it seems to me like Boston would like him to stay for at least a couple more years until their younger talent develops. Nomar right now is playing for a contract for next season. The achilles tendon injury he suffered during spring training when he was hit by a ball has seemed to slow him down a bit. It took him a lot longer than people suspected and he didn't do very well in his rehab stint in AAA Pawtucket. We shouldn't be worried yet, but if Nomar continues to struggle at the major league level, I would highly doubt we are going to see Nomar in a Red Sox uniform whether we release him or trade him before the deadline or during the Patriots Superbowl run.
