Today, this was one.((thats something she wrote above that i shouldnt really say, tho everyone reading has the ability to go see. lol)) It was wierd though, cause like, I wanted to say something, but I wanted to say it later. So, all through the conversation I was like... "well, should i... or not... He stopped askin and I shouldn't bring it up. sooo yes?" I paniced and I couldn't laugh today. I ran out of laughs. " And she said there was nothing!! thank God for journals so you can be sneaky and use things they write against them.   i shall study for english today. at least like an hour. ill try?  yes.   HAH OH YEAH THATS RIGHT GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the girl came back to her locker and looked at me, and i stared right back. she turned away. then she tried again. i won again. and now im gonna keep staring. my typing might be messed up tho. she hit someone. shes explaining something weird.
