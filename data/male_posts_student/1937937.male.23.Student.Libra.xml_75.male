I'm on a new exercise program -- I work out each day.  So far, I'm doing about two and a quarter miles on the treadmill, then 20 minutes on the exercise bike.  I don't know if this is healthy: it usually feels like my heart is about to explode at least three times during my regiment.  Some of you are probably asking, "Rob, why are you on an exercise regiment?"  To you, I say: go ask somebody else a question, because I'm not answering you.  I'm not fat, okay?  Even if I was, I'd be a good looking fat guy.  That's what my girlfriend says.  I think she's lying, but I keep that to myself.  Except for when I publish it on this blog.  Speaking of which, my girlfriend started a blog.  It's pretty cool, but she's not interested in making it public, so I'm not going to give out the address here.  Suffice to say that if you really wanted to figure it out, you probably could.  What a mystery!   Bill Clinton just isn't that good looking, either.  Girls say he's "hot" -- I don't see why -- he looks like a semi-sleazy used car salesman.  He's got that earnest, "I'm concerned with your values" type of face.  It's scary that I think of Clinton as being a stable, upstanding president.  The current one -- well, I'm frequently afraid for my life.  Just read some of the past posts.  A little neurotic, you say?  Humbug.
