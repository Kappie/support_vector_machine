After waiting outside for the doors to open, accompanied by cockney touters selling tickets to clueless foreigners, we went in and after a while the concert began. I say the concert began, but really I mean the first support act came on. Honeymoon weren't too bad (I remembered their name so if they suddenly become famous I can claim to have been a fan from the beginning.) The second lot were crap. I don't care how famous they get, they couldn't sing and they had to resort to stealing other people's songs to get any attention.  Then eventually Nelly came on and did lots of energetic songs and dancing and things. She also induced some of the younger fans to be inorexably drawn towards the stage with their hands on the air, probably high on more than just adrenaline. Later she also demonstrated her mastery of many languages (human and otherwise) by singing a whole song in Portugese, as well as making random noises to the audience and getting them to copy her. Overall it was a quite enjoyable concert, even if my legs were knackered after having to stand for ages to see over people's heads. :)
