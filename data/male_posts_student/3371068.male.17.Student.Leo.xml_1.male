I had another freak out with one of my personas, went to Matts cottage and got to hear about him beating the crap out of his brother for shooting shit at him in the early morn, and got unusually giddy about slipknots new C.D which is kickass, and two of my friends finally sharing their feelings (emenates giddiness) And no im not totally gay just giddy. Ok im kinda gay. But i have a girlfriend! haha nice save. Anyways, im supposed to do stuff with my friend Melissa on saturday. And im also going to be doing stuff tommorow with corporate steve for a project. Why am I telling people this? As far as my freakout goes, someone refer to chelsea cause im not too aware of the details.             - she seemed dressed in all of me, stretched across my shame all the torment and the pain                                      -slipknots new cd!!! so good!!
