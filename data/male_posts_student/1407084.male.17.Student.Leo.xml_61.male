How about.. a song!   excerpts from "The Voice Within" by Christina Aguilera   Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed  It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid  No one reaches out a hand for you to hold  When you're lost outside look inside to your soul   When there's no one else  Look inside yourself  Like your oldest friend  Just trust the voice within  Then you'll find the strength  That will guide your way  If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within   Yeah...  Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go  As long as you're learning  You'll find all you'll ever need to know   You'll make it  You'll make it  Just don't go forsaking yourself  No one can stop you  You know that I'm talking to you   When there's no one else  Look inside yourself  Like your oldest friend  Just trust the voice within  Then you'll find the strength  That will guide your way  If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within
