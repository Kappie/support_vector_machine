Since I broke up with my ex back in July 26th 2003 I've been not able to trust any girls for any reason. I've had girls that comes after me before I didn't realize at that time but I do now. It was this: 1) I was still not over my ex (I am still not over it now) and 2) I don't trust whatever girls says or do (I just started to begin overcome that now because of this girl I know from work). But now almost a year has pass by and.... I started to open myself up a little bit now.  This girl I met from work isn't the type I would like. Be honest, she is quite a character... compared to my ex she is no comparison in term of many things. In many ways my ex was way superior than her but I still fell into liking her. Isn't love a weird thing?  It's hard to earn back someone's trust again after so many repetitive mistakes. If my ex could give me a chance and look at me now, I've changed from 95% of the mistakes I've made before. But now isn't possible, that is perfectly OK. I understand. I can only blame myself for not realizing it earlier. I mean... who else is to blame except for my own immaturity? But changing one's personality requires a very personal caring and looking out, that's something I never got from my ex because of our situation and environment and she rather not waiting it out and abandoned me. So never ever again I will trust in long distance relationship again! Simply it isn't worth it.  Life is full of changes. I believe everyone learns something new every single day. But the hard part is taking in the good stuff and discard the bad ones, also it's hard to resist temptations. After all, we are all flesh and blood... emotions is everyone's driven force. The line between being rational and irrational is so often fine that you can't see it, not along try to judge it.  How do you feel about your past 'true' relationships? Are you still angry? sad? or no regrets about it? If you have the chance to start over again how would you be different? This is a question I often ask myself...
