It ends automatically this summer, and you know the prostitutes in the White House aren't about to push for it's renewal.  Go sign the petition over at  urlLink Tom Mauser 's website.  Tom is the father of one of the children killed by assault weapons at Columbine. Issue 2: Fahrenheit 9/11.  Get out and see it.  The truth is stranger (and sadder) than fiction. Issue 3: The October Surprise / The November Ass-Raping.    "U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack."  Q: Is there any depth the Bush Administration Pig Fuckers won't stoop to to stay in power? A: Nope, there's not.  I'd start looking into taking a month long or so vacation in October if I lived in D.C. or NYC.  Just ask Bush, he'll have some ideas how you can balance important things in you life against your need to stand idly by and do nothing.  Perhaps there's some brush that needs clearing at his ranch.  Vote (if you're allowed) Kerry/Edwards, and Bush can clear all the brush he wants.  Apparently having the voting machines manufactured by a huge Bush campaign supporter wasn't obvious enough.
