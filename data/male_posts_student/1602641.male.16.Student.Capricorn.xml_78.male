It feels similar to when I heard that Strom Thurmond had died - they had been around for so long, it almost felt as if they were immortal. Well, apparently not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to listen to U2's   Bullet The Blue Sky   to remind myself of what kind of man he really was. Everybody else should do the same.
