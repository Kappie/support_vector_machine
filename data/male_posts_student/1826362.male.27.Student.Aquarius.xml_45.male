So I just saw this Miller High life commercial, and there are  a bunch of folks sitting around a table and a beeper goes off and the guy goes outside to use the payphone, and the shop is Twin donughts in Union square allston.  I used to live right around the corner from there up until recently.  I would go there on Sunday afternoons and get two large coffees, a bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin, and two chocolate donuts to bring back to my place and consume while I fought off a hangover and read the Globe.  Every time I walked in the lady behind the counter would remember exactly how I liked my coffee (just cream, no sugar) and she would start making it before I even got to the counter.  Once I decided that I needed to try to save money by making coffee at home, and I stopped going there for a few months.  I ran out of coffee one day, so I stopped in to get a coffee.  The lady saw me and said, "large just cream, right?"  she hadn't seen me for months, but she rememberd my coffee.   Well, this commercial takes place in and around that twin donuts, and I have two comments about the commercial: 1. you can't buy beer there, because it's in Massachusetts, land of crappy liquor laws.  and 2. if the guy has a beeper, why does he have to go out to a payphone, shouldn't he have a cell? Does this commercial run in boston?
