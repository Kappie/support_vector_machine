I go around the corner and I see a car coming out of the apartments there and it is like 200 yards away.. pretty far away. As I am driving those last couple hundred feet home they flip their lights on and chase me down and I pull over in the apartment driveway.  "Sir you failed to stop at that stop sign!?" the guy says.  I said, "Ummm I have lived here three years and you guys always watch that spot.. I have NEVER failed to stop at that sign and I swear to GOD that I didn't run it. Sir you did not stop at the sign I need to license and registration. So I give it and he goes to his car .. then I hear a knock on the passenger window.. CLICK CLICK sir roll down the window! Ummm they thought I was out burglarizing on top of that because of my digital camera in shambles in the seat next to me. They searched my car and everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So the guy has his radio on and I hear them calling my name in.. in code... Roger Omega Brenda Ernie Roger Tango, Daniel, Asshole, Licker, Egotist.. sorry I got a bit carried away there but it made me made. So as I am sitting there listening to them call my name in I start to laugh. The other officer is like "SIR IS SOMETHING FUNNY!" "DO YOU FIND THIS FUNNY!" "TELL ME WHAT IS SO FUNNY!"  I was like WTF!! So I said it's just that.. then I decided to shut up and not say anything about my uncle Pat teaching me as a kid to listen to radio talk and what the codes mean and I thought that it was funny and afraid they would think I was trying to get out of a ticket by saying my uncle was a cop. So I shut up.  So I am sitting there trying to keep from laughing. . . cause you and I both know how funny it is to get pulled over for no reason.. harassed by the cops and sit and wonder if they are going to give you ticket just to be assholes when you are completely not guilty and they are abusing their power to feed their shortcomings elsewhere.  Anyways I am sitting there and the cell rings and my wife is wondering if I am ok of course... I answer and she says, "Are you O..." they cop yells, "NO CELL PHONE USE!!" and makes me slam it shut on my wife.  I said that she is just seeing if I am ok and he says again no cell phone use while being pulled over.  So of course my wife calls back and I pick up the phone and hand it to him and tell him to tell her.  He says no cell phone use again... and I slam the phone down.  GRRRRR!  The guy continues to make small talk asking about how fast the car is and the fastest I have ever had it up to and whatever like I am going to self incriminate!!?  They gave me my stuff back and told me to watch the sign. I was so infuriated! GRRRRRRRRRRR  Rob
