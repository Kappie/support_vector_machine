Its funny, her background and mine, her upbringing and mine contrast greatly as do our values. Our ideas of success and what we want out of life clash as do what we find important. Strangely, I sense in her a quiet rebellion against this upbringing. On one hand it is completely a part of her. But on the other, I can feel her changing, growing, learning about what life is all about. She has found love when she used to run from it. She has grown to love this town when she used to talk down about it. Hell, her writing is filled with utilitarian viewpoints and perspectives, yet she refuses to admit that life isn't about BMWs, cosmopolitans, pradas, and a rich sugardaddy. I'm embarrassed that I could name prada. Truth be told, this mysterious woman is in love with a regular Joe who seems to be, not of her bloodline, but I could be mistaken. The overwhelming irony of this girl's perspective is that she works beside and rooms with a man that would match her every snobbish demand in life. He shares the same vision and perversely twisted ideals about what life is all about, as well as he people in it. She sees this deep down. He does not. But if it truly is this kind of complete isolation from everything that represents middle America on down, that she seeks, why wouldn't she snatch this guy up? She would say its all about attraction, or the lack thereof. I'd like to think she halfway realizes there is a larger picture out there, because as much of a cliche as it is, money can't buy happiness. Now, I wouldn't mind givin it a shot for a while because I'm certain money could alleviate some problems, but its not what one, in my humble opinion, should wrap their minds and lifestyles around.
