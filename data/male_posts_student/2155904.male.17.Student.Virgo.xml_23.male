Yeah, Tyke almost got hit by a falling branch today on the way to school.  It wouldn't have killed him and probably wouldn't have done too too much damage but it probably would've injured him.  Luckily he saw it and managed to avoid it.  He is a really lucky guy, for the most part.  Then at school the wind was really strong at one point and it was tough to walk.  Normally it is fun when that happens but not when you are carrying a gay book and your hair isn't dry and you are walking into a car.  But anyway since school was cancelled Tyke just got up and jettered out to join the Irish Setter in the yard (allusion to this quilt-like thing Tyke's mom made and it was up at his old house but he doubts that anyone would know it).  So the entire gang all went their separate ways and then on the way home Macaroon called Tyke so he went up to his house.  Skippy, Kinker, and Amed joined in.  They played football outside Macaroon's house at 8:39 in the AM!!!!!  HOW SWEET IS THAT!!!!!  It was incredibly fun.  Then they went inside and watched MXC and listened to Tyke's Uber (not my word) Mix.  After the CD was completado they went downstairs and played DDR.  Tyke was off and he just pretty much got owned by the wireless glow in the dark pads Macaroon busted out.  But he still did pretty well.  Then they played Halo which is always and I mean always fun.  That was a blast.  Then Skippy left and Tyke got out the multi-tap and the gang played Madden with 4 people and then 5 when Amed came.  That game is insanely fun too.  Shawn Springs as a TE.  What an idea that was!!!!!  Then the gang played some more Halo and went out to Factoria to get some lunch at BK.  This didn't happen cuz there was no power at the Factoria Mall.  But since there wasn't power there weren't cars either.  So Tyke, Dr. Phil Lelee, Kinker, and Macaroon played such a great game of parking lot football.  Then Amed joined in.  That was fun.  But then they got hungry so they went over to Subway for "lunch."  After that they took a rather circuitous route home which was fun.  Tyke made an obstacle course with the debris on the road.  First time he went over it he lost and scraped his car.  But the second time he OWNED the road!!!  Then they went back to McGee's and played more Halo.  What a fun game.  And then Tyke left a little later.  He came home and did his lit term.  Then he made up some really funny definitions to flash cards for Gov.  Hehehehe.  Those things are so pointless yet so funny to make up things.  Now he is listening to some good music from over the summer.  Brand New is on now.  Call me a safe bet...I'm betting I'm not.  Glad that you could forget.  Only hoping as time goes you can forget.
