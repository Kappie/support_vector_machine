You can't tell me sensible people get asked that kind of thing in GCSE orals.   Wednesday : Went into school with Adam and generally pissed about in the lovely whether *sighs*... OK, enough of that. I then got home and, after being informed that Jon would be coming 'round within the next hour, decided it would be best to walk to Buzzy's house... clever me. But I gave myself a good half hour to get back... and walked to my nan's. Jon was late though, so hooray for sa m√®re! Showstoppers then confused me greatly, 'cause I kinda fell for Mel again, and she kinda knows again... but it's not like last year, where she ignored me for two months, so that's all right. I'm glad that hasn't happened again... But anyway, Showstoppers was cool, 'cause Jon, Toby, Mel and I are in the "elite" Showstoppers *wink wink*, which means we get to take centre-stage, basically. So weee for us and our brilliance. Really, you have to hear Mel sing Tonight. Raises the bloody roof.   Thursday : Woke up, walked to Joe's and got a lift to Aroma. Had many Chinese foods, got very ill, and then went to School with Buzz and Marcus. Hung around School for a bit, then walked into town and bussed home. Quite an OK day, but the weather got worse, so boo hoo:(.   Now : Uh, blogging... Good night, pleasant dreams, Scott.
