I've received waivers from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois; Tulane University in Akron, Ohio; and Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. I've also received information from literally hundreds of colleges and universities that I've never heard of before and don't want to go to. 
 Enewayz, that was random. I gotta lotta homework to do. I have four essays for English, a paper to type for Ms. "A.," the questionaire for Mrs. Shaw, an outline of my  entire  senior thesis for Sr. Thesis, and I think that's it.  Okay, I'm gonna go work on that now. 
 George out.
