My politics are probably closer to Moore than the author of this piece regarding guns and gun control (though perhaps not in general), so I'm not linking to this to say "ooh, look, Michael Moore's wrong."  I just thought it was a really interesting and detailed discussion -- whether it's accurate or just some guy looking to attack, I don't know.  (caveat: if you didn't see "Bowling for Columbine," odds are you won't find this link particularly interesting...)
