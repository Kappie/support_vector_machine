So I've been paciently waiting since and I also already saw the DBZ episodes and getting ready to see the brand new batch consisting of: DBZ eps 41-50 that finished downloading this morning.  I don't think I'm gonna download anymore until I can buy some CDs to empty my poor "bloated" hardrive. Oh! If only you knew how many things are in that thing.  Anyways I'm off to watch those nice classic nostalgia inducing episodes.      Don't you wish there were a knob on the TV to turn up the intelligence? There's one marked 'Brightness,' but it doesn't work. Gallagher
