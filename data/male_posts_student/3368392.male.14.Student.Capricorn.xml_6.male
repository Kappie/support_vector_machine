I'm gonnn a have to search the ENITIRE house for it cuz i need the money to buy ashton the flowers i promised her ;]. lol... i wish i cud use that money for a hat, but a deals a deal. Daniel is right next to me and lauryn is asking him "whats wrong?" like usual. Wanna go see Mean girls... GOD I NEED A HAT. Right now, growing out my hair seems like a bad idea cuz my hair always sticks up and its all uneven and fluffy. But, in a few months from now, my hair will be... AWESOME. DUN DUN DUN! well... tah tah for now. BB.
