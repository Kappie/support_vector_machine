This morning i was late getting there because I had a case of the mondays so Mr. J got pretty mad but I just blew him off so that started it off. It was hot and sticky and I didnt like it!!! I was sweating my balls off! Anyways it was really hot the whole time and no one wanted to be there. SO thank god mr. behrends finally saw everyone sweating their guts off, and so we went inside 30 MINUTES early!!!! So when we went inside my horn was so godly hot, i couldnt do anything on it. Then i didnt know if i was a whole step sharp or flat and my G# key kept sticking!!! So today was one of the worst days of the summer! oh well i gotta go to band again at 6 until 9 (im gonna miss RAW)! Peace out and have a good one!
