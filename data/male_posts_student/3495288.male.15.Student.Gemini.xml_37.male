I laid down beside them, still sleepy, and watched tv with them. Fell asleep next to them, suddenly my mom shouted in my ear, "Den! You must come along today! We need you to help us take care of the babies!". I woke up instantly. Go out? ai yah.. i was thinking of going out with my friend, Adrian, oh well.  So off i went, took my towel and went to shower. Got ready and all, took my handphone from my sister not realising that my handphone battery was flat! MAN! i can't sms people! no fair!   It was hard, carrying them around, chasing after them. This rugrats are really naughty. Yet i still love them because they are so  CUTE!  We went to Changi Airport. Luckily go there. Its so spacious and its freedom for the this babies as they love to run around like dogs chasing after cats. Many facilities have changed. It has been 5months i did not visit the airport. Hahah. Well its great to see the changes and more  HOT Guys  in uniform walking around the airport. Oh man! those tight pants are revealing those nice butts and balls. haha! We went to eat at the food court at Terminal 2. There was this American guy, he kept looking at my babies as if he wants to kidnap them. I looked at him in the eye and smiled at him, he just smile back and turn away. After that we had a long walk around the airport. My parents were free to walk like a couple, as for me... its was torture! The babies were running around in circles! They would climb on me, pull my pants (luckily i wore a belt), pulled my shirt and hair! They ran here and there. Hugged my legs and tried to stop me from walking! My nephew even slapped my head while he was sitting on my shoulders! My poor hair! hahaha. At least i had fun.   After that we went home. I slept in the train like a baby. I woke up a few station before my destination. The guy, i think he is 23yrs... he looks like tat what, was staring at my rainbow tag on my neck. When i saw him staring at it, i took it out and kept it. Then i took out my new rainbow wrist band!, he giggled abit and nudged me. I was wondering what for did he nudged me?. Did he want my number? why? oh well, he wasn't that good looking. Haha. When i alighted, he shouted good bye. I turned back, he winked at me. I just blushed away.   I took a really short nap when i got home. When i woke up, i went online. Went to Mirc and chatted at  Sgboy  and  GAM  chatroom. My friend was there. I chatted to him, all of the sudden he asked me this question.  F:"Btw. U r seeking Friends, Chat and LTR rite?" Me:"Yeah. Why?" F:"Well...for this past few days. I have been thinking. I am asking this sincerely okie. Will you accept me as your boyfriend?" Me:"O.O! are you sure? look we just know each other for like what 2days and you already ask me that question. I would like to get to know you better before i can decide whether i can accept you as my boyfriend or not lor. Maybe we can go out one day or what and talk. Sms each other." F:"Oh okie. I know i am a bit older then you by 3years. Well okie lor...when can we meet? tml?" Me:"Tml? well tml i can't i am meeting my new gay boy - friend. Not boyfriend okie... a GAY - BOY friend.
