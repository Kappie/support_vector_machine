Seemingly being a scapegoat of my classmate's rascalness and deligently scoling my teacher mad, I don't think i'm in the wrong at all. English lessons came to be a movie panorama. Chemisrty was a sleepover and common test was kinda simple. Speed it all thru with confidence and did all that I know. Can't imagine doing silly stuff and sharing retard moments with Jieren together with little gossips and giggles around by classmates. Not to mention, even smsing with Jas and Ernie at such moments. Soccer supporting wasn't that normal esp when Jieren was around. He seemingly took over corey's position as the joker. Laughting and creating nonsensical tricks like telling edmund to kick the ball to this express kid's face. And doing retard things to irritate any of our classmates as possible. Mom's birthday was celebrated in Swensen's and later at this most panoramic view at Bottle tree village. Such cold and spine-chilling breeze accompanied by the warm food treats and some heavy chat, well it seems relaxing. Planning a way down to that place again. Such a great experience.
