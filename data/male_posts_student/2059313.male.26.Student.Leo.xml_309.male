My roommate made me nervous most of the night by having needles and his medkit out (he's a medic in the National Guard).  One person was a brave soul and let him practice giving an IV.  I couldn't watch.  I have a sensitivity when it comes to needles and blood.  Mostly, Card Night went well, but it was a bit of a let-down.  I wish a couple more people would've been there or something.  Oh well.  Next week will be better, hopefully.  Couldn't be the lack of alcohol.... could it?
