My favorite part:  "As for Shaq, this is the biggest part of the myth, literally and figuratively. It's like all Shaq has to do is stomp his foot, and the world trembles. I actually thought Doug Collins would soil himself the other night when Gary Trent had the temerity, the gall, to tap Shaq on the shoulder and move him off Mark Madsen.   'Don't pull on Superman's cape!' Collins begged. OK, when Superman shows up in the NBA, I'll remember that. In the meantime, play on, m@$%@!"  Also over at ESPN.com, see John Clayton's piece on the  urlLink AFC West .
