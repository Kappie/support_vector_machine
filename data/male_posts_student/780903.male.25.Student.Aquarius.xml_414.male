Like 2000 pages total.  It's interesting stuff, and I'm sure I could write a compelling description, like "Learn what it's like to be a Harvard Law student by purchasing this big stack of readings from a 1L torts class.  Exam included.  Buyer pays shipping."  And maybe someone would even bid.  Some super-motivated incoming student who's really curious and wants to get a head start.  But I'd hate for the professor to feel bad if he somehow heard about it, although it's really no different from selling casebooks back to bookstore... I don't know, it feels different.  I'm tempted though.  Because I don't what else to do with these 2000 pages besides throw them on a shelf somewhere.  They were interesting to read, but I don't know that I need to ever read them again... anyone want them?
