Her boyfriend even offered to show me how to weight train for a few weeks until his job took him up north for the summer. Lacking the motivation (read: courage) to continue figuring this out on my own, I relegated myself to the elliptical machines. I'd longingly look at the weight machines and wonder what to do, but after my time was up on the elliptical I'd quickly scurry out the door. Then I found out the gym will help you design a fitness program and show you how to use all the equipment for free - what a bonehead! I can't believe I took so long to ask.  Anyway, I have an appointment tomorrow morning. Can't wait!
