So I had a go back at her and went to the library and spoke to Tanya.  At lunch we had a water fight. That was good.  In Chemistry Mr Round was having one of those "I-can't-teach-for-shit" days, and I didn't understand a word he was saying. So I was rude and sarcastic, which I'm sorry for. Karmann said I'm gonna drive him to a mental breakdown and/or suicide. Great.  Physics was alright, if not a bit boring. I'm kinda sick of it.  I DUN WANNA GO TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY. I just wanna see Kieran.
