A little motivation from my eldest bro and I gave up fending for my tooth. Twasn't bad actually, it's just that I hate the first 2 injections. And again, 2? I took 3. The first 2 didnt kill the pain throughoutly. Yes, it feels like ant bite, like my mum said.   Yes, most Malaysians are chickens when they come face to face with a dentist, bothj skilled and unskilled. It's true, I struggled like a chicken waiting to be slaughtered by a butcher. Bad enough, me and my bro had the SAME, I repeat, SAME problem. Except that he had his pest on the right side, and mine on the left. I was called in first. The dentist looked normal enough. He checked my tooth and said the same thing as my mum did. "The tooth wont do any good if it stays." Oh boy, did my mouth felt violated or what. Then, he took an x-ray of my tooth to check on it's root. If it's straight, it would be easy and if it's crooked, it's doomsday. Mine was straight by the way and was praying for it to be crooked so that I wont have to remove it. Dont really know about my bro's.  The first injection was the sUx. I felt itchy all over my gum and wanted to scratch. Then, the second injection wasnt so bad. After that, the dentist tried to remove the tooth. He stick something into the side of my tooth and attempted to remove it, hence the pain rushing into the pin-point part. I cried "Ith hurths, it hurths..." and the dentist said "Um, you need another injection." Thats how I ended up with 3 tiny holes in my gum. The tooth came out and I never knew. LOL, was I freaked out to find a bloody tooth beside me. Well, it was worth it and... Yes, my gum's still numb from the injections. Wonder will I suffer from "Tranquilizea Overdosee"(dont mind this one, it means nothing). Anyway, peace and Zengar outh.
