First, I had a blogger account a long time before I had a LJ account.  I always liked Blogger, and since they updated with all of these new features, I figured I would go back and give it a try.  2.   urlLink Tony Pierce  told me to go from LJ to Blogger.  Since  urlLink Tony Pierce  is really one of the only people I would listen to even though I have never met him in person, I decided to come back to Blogger.  All of this must sound really silly.  But, don't be sad, children, for there is hope.  I have created a syndication of my Blogger account that you LJ users can subscribe to.  This way, I'll still show up in your friends page, and you can still leave comments.  Talk to me if you have any questions.  -samshapiro
