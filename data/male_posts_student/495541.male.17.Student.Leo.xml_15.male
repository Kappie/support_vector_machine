I was kind of left alone to do nothing.  I messed around with the network and got it working with the two computers.  That's when I last posted.  After that, I went to bed for a couple hours.  I don't remember well what happened.  I went upstairs layed down.  It didn't seem like I was that tired.  I didn't feel tired, for that matter.  I just dozed off and later I wake up about 4 or  5 hours later.  By that time, I find Chase and Brett on both computers.  Neither want to give them up.  Chase's computer still broke meantime.  Some error like  urlLink unmountable_boot_volume .  We didn't get it fixed either.  I figured he probably messed something up on the XP install.  He said he'd gotten the same error before since he got the upgrade.  I figured he didn't change the drive to NTFS and just left it to FAT32.  The Microsoft page said it might have had something to do with disk optimizations.  He didn't have any on, to my knowledge.  They also said to disable a couple things in the BIOS.  Nothing worked.  I think he actually made it worse by loading a factory default of something.  For some reason doing that almost always messes something up.  He's just going to have to go get it fixed by someone who wants to spend time on it.  :-X  Turns out Karl didn't leave  urlLink C/A .  It's probably a good thing he didn't.  We also downsized the clan.  We've only got 11 guys now.  I also was promoted to Major, which is so ubber leet.  Not sure how that's any different from the below ranks as far as power, but isn't it just cool to have that title.  Major Halbe... for some reason taht doesn't sound right.  I'm liking the sound of General Halbe.  Really doesn't matter.  They're getting a nice T1 server too.  That should be nice.  I hope it gets big.  The last server we had never had anyone in it.  It would be much nicer to have so many people like  urlLink edu .  That's all for now. :-)  Good night.
