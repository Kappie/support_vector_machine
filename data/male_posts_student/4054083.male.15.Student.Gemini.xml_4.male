Lindsey called me on the 16th, she got my email, and she felt bad about the other night, and we're good. She rocks again :P. She's going up to BC with her mom next week (Either her or her sister, but it'll most likely be her), to check stuff out. So... dunno whats gonna happen there. I know she's moving soon, so if I'm gonna make any kind of move I need to do it soon. I wanna do something to sort of make her realise how much she means to me, and that she should like... not date anyone :P. I seriously don't want her to go... she said once she's in BC she's not coming back, and that's gonna suck so hard. If I'm still falling for her in a couple years, I'll look into college in BC lol.  Umm... really nothing much else happened. Bought Cryptic Writings the other day, and it's a helluva lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Dave's voice is awesome in it.  I've been playing guitar lately, and I just can't seem to make anything new. Wehther its laziness, or lack of inspiration I dont know. I've written three songs in the last week, and I'm doing okay with those, maybe I was meant to be a vocalist. I'd like to get ina  band, but I don't know anybody, so it makes it hard. We bought a keyboard too, and I like it. I'll haveta look into learning notes and songs on it in the near future.  Well, tonight's prolly gonna be pretty samey. I'll prolly go home, we'll sit around, I'll try making something on guitar or keyboard, it won't work, and I'll go to bed :P. Beside my boring night ahead of me, I'm in a pretty good mood. :)
