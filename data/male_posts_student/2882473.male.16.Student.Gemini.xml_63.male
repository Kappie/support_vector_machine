And after many of my friends have finished. And after a weekend. And in the afternoon, meaning I have a morning of worry. All bad circumstances, but together... HELL. This weekend  will  be bad. Well, it won't be that bad, I suppose. I'll probably be feeling sorry for myself, with the impending doom of what is now known as a business exam. I doubt I'll do any revision for it. I hate the subject, and if I got a C or a B, would it be  that  bad? I'm not doing it next year, and don't plan to do any business/english related course at university. That is if I go to university. I haven't really decided yet. And plus I kind of revised for the other two exams we had, and they didn't go too badly. Well, I nearly threw up in the first one, but we'll say no more about that. :) And even if I did revise, I doubt it would improve my grade  that  much. There's just so much to learn, so I won't bother. :) Yes, lots of reasons why not to revise.  Looking at my MSN list, out of the 7 people online, 4 have football related names, no doubt due to the game that was played last night, between England and Portugal, I think. I didn't watch it (who do you think I am?) but as I was going to sleep, I heard the radio presenters comment on the penalties that were being done as I lay in my bed, trying to go to sleep. I must have fallen asleep just before the game ended, because I din't find out untill the radio switched back on at 0630 this morning who had won. It turns out Portugal won, if you didn't already know. So, what was I doing during the football? I was actually watching a rather ammusing film on channel 5, with Robin Williams in. Called 'Father's Day', if I remeber correctly. 'Twas rather good.  I may as well write a bit about what I've been doing today. Statistics...  foundation  was first, which was incredibly easy, and lasted 2 hours. I finished in 50 minutes, and by 1 hour, all had been checked numerous times. So, what did I do in the remaining 60 minutes of the exam? I recited the Architect speech from Matrix Reloaded in my head, twice, then started it in pig latin, but it got rather confusing, so I stopped. Let's see... what else... Oh yes, I how many bricks tall the wall of the hall was, untill it got to the wooden layer of the wall. It turns out the wall was 54 bricks high. Oh, and I tried to memorise the square root of 2, now what was it...? 1.414213652? I'll check... 1.414213562. Oh well, nearly remembered it. Ah, and then I recite the first 15 minutes of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Radio series (that's about as far as I could remember) That took me to about 5 minutes to the end of the exam. And as the second hand crawled round the clock, the exam finished exactly on time. 2 hours... wow. But the fun wasn't over! Oh no, next I had a physics extension exam. Lucky me! It wasn't too bad, and I think I did fairly well on both exams today. In exactly 3 days, I will be in that business exam, with 45 minutes of exams left.  Lastly, I would like to say 'damn you' to the following people, for finishing their exams:  urlLink megatrobe ,  urlLink stompp ,  urlLink astrojaxx ,  urlLink moolb , matt, steve, dave rangel, dave cooper, and lots of others.  Bye for now.   Weather:  A few clouds, quite warm. Bright at the moment.
