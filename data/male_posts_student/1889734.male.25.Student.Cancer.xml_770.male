I don't think it is necessary to go into a tirade about the dark abyss of evil contained inside this quote.  It's so blatant, I imagine she's regretting speaking so honestly about what is at the core of her bankrupt philosophy.   "'Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you,' Sen. Clinton said. 'We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.' "
