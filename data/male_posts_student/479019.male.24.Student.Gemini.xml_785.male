Apparently Melissa knows people that Nancy doesn't like. The world is an incredibly small place.  Andy (high school friend) knows the same Hungarians that Mark (college friend) knows. Brandon (high school friend) knew the same people Mike (college friend) knows. John (grad school friend) knows about Dan (former boss). Then there's all the people that Steff knows, Heather and Julia, Janet and Toni-Lynne and Diana. There's more. I am at the center of all social relations.  ***
