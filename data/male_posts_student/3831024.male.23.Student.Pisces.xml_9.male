Most of history's great people have in some way gone through it. jose rizal, mahatma gandhi, karl marx.... the list goes on. they say people with the same complex claim they have the key to the salvation of man kind. and so goes the claim of most of our politicians... but i wouldnt know. the only keys i have are the keys to the house, and i lost that a while ago. i wanna go home.... wahhhh
