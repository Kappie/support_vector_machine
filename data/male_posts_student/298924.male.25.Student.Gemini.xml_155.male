The homie Geoff is the social coordinator for the class and thusly I usually make the flyers and what not for events....so yesterday we are supposed to have an event at The Sports Cafe on the Water at Metrocenter....Geoff had gone up there the day before to make final arrangements and give them some expected numbers....the usuals....  Why do we arrive and the Sports Cafe is CLOSED???....not closed for the day see you tomorrow....closed for a while, paper on the door, big signs closed....man we were salty....we went through a series of calling people to notify them of the cancellation of event and what not....and end up where everyone in Nashville ends up....Chili's....but it sucks that I worked my creative juices hard for nothing....  Anyway three of my closest Nashville friends were born on Sept. 6th so they are having a big party tomorrow....I am supposed to be making the punch....the last batch of punch I made was a rousing success....so we'll see this time....  Time to make a celebratory round of drinks and play some Madden....
