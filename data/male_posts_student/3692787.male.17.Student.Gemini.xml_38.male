Pinaasa niya lang ako! *full emphasis please* Lecheng pag-ibig 'tooo!" ------------------------------ Stupid Yeo. Stupid Cardona. If it weren't for them I could probably cheer for La Salle, even if they beat UP by 1 point yesterday. Everything seemed to swing in our favor: it was the first UAAP game that Jam (and presumably her friend) had watched live, it was the first time my sister's fiancee had seen a game in four years, and I, soon-to-be supreme evil dictator of the whole entire world, whose negative forces of energy caused Joseph Yeo to miss the last shot against Adamson, was in attendance. What could have possibly gone wrong?  Well, my sister's fiancee suddenly got the notion to rip off the maroon UP flag that they give away at the games and use the plastic stick as a mock arrow for aiming at the La Sallians. It was at  exactly that moment  that the Archers had started mounting their comeback. In the end, we lost by a point. What does this prove? Nothing, if you don't consider the fact that I didthe exact same thing with a DLSU flag (without the arrow bit) during the DLSU vs. AdU game.The moral of the story? NEVER rip off a playing school's flag while sitting on said school's side. ------------------------------ Things are getting a bit harder for me in UP. I've been coming home exhausted lately, and even Math 17 is getting kind of not-so-easy. Ack... maybe I should do that "thing" that everyone talks about... what's it called? Studying? Or is it reading? Something like that, but mind you, my translation skills are slightly rusty.  I've been feeling... hmm... how should I put this...  Ok, let's put it this way. If I met myself from, oh, about six or so months ago, that past self would kick my ass. Hard. It's just that I realized that I've been such a wuss lately, and I really don't know why.   It is with due justification sometimes. For example, I'm in the College of Science, right? Who the hell graduated from the College of Science? No one knows, no one cares. Now, consider the people from CMC, or from the College of Law, or from Econ. Count 'em.  Heeheehee.  That is why I have chosen to follow the "course." The "course" is basically my ever-changing gameplan of sorts, and it's looking pretty good right now. The one semi-sure thing right now is I'mgonna get my ass outtaBS Math, or if I stay, I'm gonna make damn sure Imake something of myself.Since I'm pretty damnsure I won't be making it big as a writer or something like that, I will concentrate on making myself the richest-ass bastard ever! I will be a sellout"wit da skillzto pay da billz yo!"I refuse to accept my "destiny" as a *shiver* teacher! (AUGH! NOOOOO!!!) Virtu over fortuna baby!  Without further ado, I present to you... DA KORS!!! (there will be no Irish girls singing! Punks) -After graduating from BS Math, I will take the Law Aptitude Test and get a law degree. Whether or not I actually become a lawyer is irrelevant, as I am only after the business background. Cash money baby! -If I get good enough grades, I will shift to Business Administration with Accountancy. This is a win-win situation, since graduating from this course alone is pretty much sufficient for my kinda lifestyle. -If I don't get into BAA or into the College of Law, I'll take up actuarial science (or am I taking that up right now?). I hear these durned matheematikal folks plum make sum goood money... -In any case, I'll likely have an extended stay in UP, which is fine by me I suppose. I mean, I'm not gonna be a broadcaster in a snap like some people I know. Something Mass Comm-related appeals to me though, so I might leaf over their offerings real quick. -Katt says Jessica Zafra took Comparative Lit. Hmm... -If all else fails (i.e. my grades), then there's always...   "Kuya what's that?" "It isthe dreaded lair of tormented souls! It is the scariest place in this or any other realm or dimension! It is where people who have nothing else to look forward to in life go to smoke weed and fantasize about internet orgies all day! It is... it is...!" *booming, evil voice comes out of nowhere* "D-C-T-I!!!!!"  AAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!  completely wrong thought of the day: I have either a short paper to finish or some charred animal flesh to devour. I should probably study for Math 17, and I have to get a decent night's sleep. Yet here I am, blogging away, saying irrelevant things that no one really cares about. Heh... I'm making the world a better placealready!  *How?*  ...screw yourself with a stick! Smacktard.  (Sorry, I got nothin')
