It's a decision that bears a striking resemblance to another  urlLink local pol's   But honestly, I hope things work out for Kelly. He's fighting an uphill battle, what with one now-partisan former-St.-Paul-mayor Democrat-turned-Republican senator already bumming around with the cool kids in the White House. But then again, it's not like Bush   previous actions...and what did he do? Why, he went on to win a Senate seat for his brand new party! Isn't it amazing what a little help from the preznit will get you? wants   to be  urlLink exposed to new ideas .  He seems to have enough trouble grasping the  urlLink ones he's supposed to be working on  right now.
