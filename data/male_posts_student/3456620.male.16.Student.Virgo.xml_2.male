But along with the happiness comes the anger...  After the patch, the server's become unstable and disconnects players randomly.  Sasa (Kuraki) can't move without being disconnected.  There's some weirdo chinese system messages popping up.  My font has miraculously changed to bold and has become somewhat illegible.  It's so horrible...  =_=
