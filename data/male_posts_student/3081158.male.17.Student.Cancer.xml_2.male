Just what does sovereignty mean?  The handover is allegedly a "key path to democracy in Iraq," but the reign of the democracy only extends as far as the shackles of the occupier will allow it. Perhaps liberators intended to give Iraq more than democracy like the benefit of "the imposition of emergency laws, including curfews," and the privelige of "160,000 U.S.-led foreign troops" of which the new democracy will have no control over, probably for security reasons.   Damn, security must be nice for the Iraqis. I mean, they get the privelige of democracy  and  the security of being "barred from making long-term policy decisions" and  the "interim government will not be able to amend the interim constitution." There is a law that " restricts certain candidates from running for office" for an even more secure democrracy. Also, the prime minister of the interim government is unsure of when it will be safe for the new election to be held, and that their elections may be "postponed until February or March," even though the United Nations said there was to be an election no later than January 31.     These privelidges are not only for the Iraqis, though. Western contractors were given " immunity from Iraqi law while performing their jobs in Iraq"  As Bush put it after Condoleeza Rice informed him of the handover, "Let freedom reign."  According to  urlLink AP :    This is a historical day ... a day that all Iraqis have been looking forward to," said Iraqi President Ghazi Al-Yawer. "This is a day we are going to take our country back into the international forum.   However:   There was little initial public reaction to the near-secret transfer ceremony, which was broadcast on Iraqi and Arabic satellite television stations. There was no celebratory gunfire â€” which rattles through Baghdad when Iraq's national soccer team defeats foreign clubs. - AP   Indeed, Mr. President. Let freedom reign.
