And I envy you Italians for the ease with which you pick up Spanish. No hablabas espanol antes de tu llegada en Barcelona, y ahora escribes y hablas mejor que yo. I just wanted to drop a quick note for Beatrice saying benvenuti (??)...now I have to study before SIESTA TIME!!!! Take care everyone.    Tim
