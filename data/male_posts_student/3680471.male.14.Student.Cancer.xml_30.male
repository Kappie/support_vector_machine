So I went home and he came over. We went on the internet and did some crap. Then we played Halo for bout an hour and then Red Dead Revolver. So then we went downstairs to eat hotdogs, and drink these juices, it was hilarious, you just had to be there. Then we went over Sarahs, and we those liquid ice things. One popped and got in our eyes. OMG!!! That was the worst thing ever. It hurt so bad. Like we both could cry. My eye was burning, and when you open it, it would like sting. It hurt so bad. Gosh, It hurt for like 30 minutes. Sarah gave us water and we poured it all in our eye. Oh geez. It really is liquid ice guys, cuz when you open your eye, you couldnt hold for more then 2 secs. Finally after I held it for a long time, it started to stop hurting. GEEZ STAY AWAY FROM LIQUID ICE. Anyways. In theropy from our SCARY ACCIDENT, we went to my house. Did whatever and Daddy Daycare was on, so we watched it. That flash kid rocks, and the one that speaks the star trek. lol. At 5:45 we went to robbies and we play fifa soccer, and then he went to eat. So my cousin picked me up and I went to smoothie king. Oh I got the big one, made me sick afterwards. Then on my way home, robbie came back over. We shot basketball then got on the computer. We were downloading all these funny songs and put them on my PCDJ(its a song mixer). It was hilarious. He had to go in so, I got on the internet and played halo. Then I went to bed at 12(Wow I know, isnt that amazing). I woke up, took a shower and everything, now I am sitting here and waiting to go church. Well I guess I will see you there. Seeya guys.
