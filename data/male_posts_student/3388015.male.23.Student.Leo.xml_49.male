Jesus Christ was the main character of this play, the bride and groom merely extras.   Pastor:  Jesus Jesus Jesus. Christ Christ Christ. Hey, these people are getting married. Repent all ye sinners. Jesus Christ is #1.  Woof!   So what's the point? THE POINT IS Luke and I were the best looking couple there. Word up to Mr Matt Mann, groomsman and usher from Sloansville, NY. He was super super cute. I was silently wishing he would ask me out, so we could go on three dates and I would inevitably get bored of him like every other guy I like because he's good looking. I guess it's best nothing happened. I couldn't possibly go out with someone from Sloansville. [Pardon me, while I climb this ladder to pick my nose.]  I spent quality time with Luke's horse, Tasha. She is a healthy happy horse with a full belly and a perfectly round peach-like behind. I'm jealous. I played with the doggies and poked the piggies.   The night in Fayette (West Fayette, thank you) capped off with a viewing of Stephen King's 1984 Children of the Corn starring a less man-like Linda Hamilton. It was a nightmare. Devout christians are always terrifying and Stephen King knows it. It was only fitting that our sinful, gluttonous, Christ-less day ended with Children of the Corn.  The Power of Christ compels me to go to sleep.
