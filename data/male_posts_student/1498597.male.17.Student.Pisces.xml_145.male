Its kinda like, when you get a new VG (video game for those who don't know of the acronyms I've made up over the years) and you play it every miserable hour of yer life and then get yelled at by yer old man for playin' and then continue to play some more.  You just wanna keep playin' and playin', or in this case bloggin' and bloggin', at the beginning.  I hope I never get tired of bloggin' or anythin', and I'm sure  Nick and Elyse  will hear nothin' of that and will prolly do anythin' in their power to prevent me from stoppin'  I should hope so!  Anyway, why did I start bloggin'?  Well, there are a lot of reasons and yes, Nick , Liz, and Elyse (and hopefully the others) are some of the reasons.  Well some of the other reasons are:  to inform the world of the atrocities that happen everyday, to show the world my outlook on life's ups and downs, and the possibility that typin' up my feelings and emotions and sharing them with others might not only benefit other people, but maybe myself as well.  Anyway, what can you expect to get outta this blog...?  I dunno, you can search for some special meaning in all these words, and fuck maybe there is, but basically its just a punk kid typin' up his opinions on this scary place, where Hotchick69 could really be some fat guy waitin' to jump on yer ass and rape you, where porn makes up about 3/4 of all the places you can visit, and insecurities can be erased by way of emotionless and idle conversation called "the IM"...this is the Net; a "cyber-haven" built on a foundation of lies and deceit.  Hmm...how similar to the real world it is.  Only a few people choose to wield the truth and even fewer still have the balls to speak about it.  Well, just somethin' you should think about.  Anyway, I've met my goal of typing more words in this blog than the last I just posted.  More to come...!
