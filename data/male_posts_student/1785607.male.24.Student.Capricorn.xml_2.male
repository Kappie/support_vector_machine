Back at school and having no time to even sit... and again lovin' it  But why you'd ask... well... is so simple it's stupid:  "Hate to have all that free time to think in what could have and didn't"  ... and that's what I love about being so damn busy with school...   Last wensday was my mum's birthday... I didn't buy her anything, have the money though... but don't get mad at me, she knows I have the money for her present and that I'll take her later next week to spend it... we both are busy.. so...
