I am like the biggest band geek I know along with Sarah.  Good times.  I don't know what I would do without band.  It is the only reason I want school to start.  It just won't be the same though without Sarah. Well anyways after jazz band I went to the beach.  Sarah hurried me along and we went to the beach to hang out with her family.  They were really nice.  It was fun hanging out with her cousins.  We went swimming in which I got burned a little.  We played Dutch Blitz which was intense.  We also played ultimate frisbee which is always cool.  I will probably go out there again tommorow.  Sarah's aunt wants me to bring my trumpet but I don't how I feel about bringing it to play for her whole family.  We had lunch and dinner there which was really good.  I love food, I could eat all day.  Later we went to Bible study.  Bible study was fun as always.  It was nice because we actually somewhat talked about stuff that mattered.  Like stuff we want to do to help God.  I am excited, I really hope we can do some of it.  Our youth group I think is getting more fired up which is awesome to see.  Well I think I am going to go to bed because I have to work at 5:30.
