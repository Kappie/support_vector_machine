Seeing Carrie kind of reminded me that, I do in fact miss her dearly.  But Mike raised an interesting point on the way home, not the "all girls are crazy" but how even he has issues with Jen, like, stuff I didn't know that he was even concerned with but yeah, it's there.  He doesn't know what he's going to do either.  Well, so this made me realize, even if Carrie and I do get back together, like what's the chance that more problems aren't going to arise?  Like aldergrove is a looong way away from white rock, it's like a freaking boonie town.  Who could stand living there?! Sigh, so this makes me realize a whole new set of problems, plus the fact that I dont think Carrie would view me as her top priority, even before I doubt she did, because yeah, if i really was a priority to her, then I would probably have seen her often enough while we were dating.  Right now I figure, there's nothing really to do, I'm gonna go back to playing the field, because the distance just isn't worth it with her.
