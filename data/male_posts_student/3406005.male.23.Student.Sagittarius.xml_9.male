The first, and best, example includes the Liberals' new plan on gas taxes. Stephen Harper pre-empted the Libs on the issue and Ralph Goodale, the finance minister, was left studdering in response. A few hours later, though, the finance department had its own gas tax policy ready to go, Goodale was briefed, and he made a triumphant return to TV land. Gratifyingly, journalists described the day as an exercise in " urlLink eating Conservative dust ." (Here, incidentally, is a retro pic of Ralph, prior to his being inspired by the quaff of Archie Bunker and his discovery of the funky-ass spectacles shop frequently, er, frequented by Joe Clark.)  urlLink    Retro-Ralph urlLink     A few days later, Anne McLellan and Reg Alcock emerged to announce  urlLink revisions to the old gun control act , including a cap on spending. Trouble is, the minister responsible for gun control had no idea the changes were coming, and was  urlLink a little peeved by the whole thing . Oopsies! Liberal backbenchers, a restive bunch lately, also voiced dissatisfaction with the changes.   The same day (I think) Paul Martin wandered into Toronto with local MPs Dennis Mills and Joe Volpe to announce a boatload of spending on the development of the Toronto waterfront. For the event, the mayor o' Toronto  urlLink "snubbed"  Martin and the premier, Dalton McGuinty, was off hiding in a bunker somewhere and unable to attend. The normally sympathetic Toronto Star published a  urlLink scathing editorial  on the announcement, claiming that Martin had recycled the announcements for no other reason than to boost the electoral fortunes of Volpe and Mills (the latter, incidentally, has the honour of facing off against Jack Layton in Toronto-Danforth).   Seems to me like a pretty piss-poor way to run a country.
