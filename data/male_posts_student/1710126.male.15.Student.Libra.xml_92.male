Still remember the day in sec 1 when we have to decide if we want to take hcl...howi insised i take tho my mother said it was risky...did i make the right choice? Its so easy to make choices for others, but so hard to make decisions for oneself.  My father said i shuld bcoz simply i m juz bad n have no time. Juz spoke to my mother however, she said i shuld take it. Rather convinced lahz. Thx louis and ivan for hearing me out, helped me alot. Got a load off my chest. Feel slightly betta oredy.
