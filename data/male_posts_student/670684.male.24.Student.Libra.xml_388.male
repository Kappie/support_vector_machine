But rare is the insatible urge to type to my reading audience.    Anticipation.  And the best. dream. ever. last night.    DREAM - realistic beyond belief, even to the point of me being awoken by an early knock at the door.  Neigbhor cheers me on with my pursuit, but her mention causes second-guessing.  I tear into my car to fix the problem (because the problem is in my car, I guess), when she enters.  Walks up to the car.  Hands me the note.  The box is checked yes.  A sense of self-loathing for resorting to 8th grade tactics, but relief nevertheless.  A kiss.  I pull away.  She pushes on, but I make note of my appearance and lack of morning oral hygeine at this point.  She doesn't care.  Wait.  She does.  Simple discussion of the consequences of such action, an understanding of the situation, what it can be and what it won't be.  "This would only last six weeks anyway, probably," she says.  I wonder why.  Too elated to really care.    Then the wake-up.  And I look at the clock, and it's 9am.  9AM!  What the hell am I doing up at 9?  Six hours of sleep is fine, but rare is the day that I can manage on six when I've got nothing to do but my own projects...no meetings, no classes, just my writing.  But I'm up.  And the day starts.    ---  Yesterday - meeting Mark Moskowitz, director of a documentary I heralded on this same blog in July,  urlLink Stone Reader .  He taught a class, I sat in on it.  Not only was it great to meet a guy who made a film I really enjoyed, but I asked the penultimate question during the Q session.  This question is years in the making, not because of Moskowitz, but because of a life in academia, and understanding what every great bellowing question requires--ego, knowledge, tangents, and finally a basic premise that, if in the wrong hands, would be a three word ask resulting in a flippant answer.   At the beginning of  Stone Reader , you admit you are a bibliophile, and your love of books is shown by the walls and walls of fiction novels you own.  And today you covered stories from Faulkner's  A Rose for Emily  to Mossman's magnum opus  The Stones of Summer , as well as the gauntlet in documentary films.  With all that in mind, what makes a good story?   No one knows the answer, really, though Moskowitz gave a good one.  But if you ever want to know  what makes a good, pretentious academic question? , read above.    Tonight -- Watching  Stone Reader  again.  Questions.  Friends who hopefully will love the film as much as I did.
