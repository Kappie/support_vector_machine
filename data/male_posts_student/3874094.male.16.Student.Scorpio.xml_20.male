Tuesday....being an even week, had IAC. Seriously, though i do understand the aim behind Ngee Ann implementing all these modules, i still think they are a serious waste of time. I mean like come on man, how much awareness about the community are you gonna raise by making us do projects like these? Futhermore, we still have to endure the lecturer rambling about the current social stigmas that exist in today's Singaporean society....well yea i guess its something worth mentioning and also something worth thinking about but hey, we have been exposed to something called Social studies since we were like what, primary 4? Down with all these dumb community classes...they are a COMPLETE waste of time! Uh well moving on, did the WAA test, and while the lecturer was talking about the instructions and blah blah blah, i was busy creating a virtual cd of Jay's new album..wahahaha many thanks to sookjai!  WAA test went pretty ok...would be interesting to see how i fare in WAA....and yea, dont know why i am suddenly hooked onto jay..i mean i have always been ok and all with Jay's music and i do have some of his music in the laptop but well, its kinda funny that i am suddenly so into him all of a sudden..hmmm...bah wateva. Went back to yuhua as usual, had fun in teasing shehui about already listening to jay's new album while she was still in school pining away....pity. And oh, it was rather amusing to see poor ys grimacing when well, he got hit by freshly made bird turd during dinner..and to make matters worse, the coffeshop's toilets were under renovation so he had to make a slight detour to another available toilet..wahahaha hey man, what can i say...life's a bitch yea?  Well yea moving on to wednesday....had more fun during FS...did slightly more basic Set Theory..interestingly he introduced formulaes for the Set theory and even more interestingly he merged Set theory with Probability.....woot. Played Cm during the 2 hour long break...and what made today special was that about five of us had Western food take-out in class...pretty ironic when there is a huge No Eatin  No Drinking sign pasted on the door! Had problems trying to hook onto the Np network....so i just listened to Jay with the ear phones on while studying 2's complement while the rest of the class were busy with CS...oh well...bugger...  CSA test...was a major killer....i, being the blind and dumb ass, failed to notice the space inbetween the characters....dang...there went all my marks for the first question...hope he gives me credit for my workings though. And question 2? Seriously hope that my 2' s complement workings are correct...though i already know that my conversion of 145 to hexadecimal is already wrong...which means i got one part of question 2 wrong...boohoo.  Yeap, celebrated little cousin by the name of anna's birthday. Haigen Diaz oreo ice cream cake....heard it cost a whopping hundred and twenty bucks! But  oh maaaaaaaan,  the moment you take a bite out of it, you are seriously in  heaven.   And yeap, that rounds off the day, need to ascend to dreamland, damn classes starts at nine am tomorrow...and oh yea, there is still the psp test to contend with...hopefully its as easy as mr lim says it is...well with that, i am outta hereeee....*yAwn*  Later people.
