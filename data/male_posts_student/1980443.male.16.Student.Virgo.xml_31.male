Anyway, also I want to at least have started a family with my wife of course... Have a stable job that keeps a steady income..  Be routed in a local church, keep in touch with my sister, and stay away from the in-laws.  There's a whole lot of little things that goes on in all of those things I just mentioned, you can figure them out for yourself!  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
