It seems that everyone finds themselves stressed, and caught in the process our parents tell us about.  It's odd, to see it happen, and especially when it happens to your person.  It's a strange phenomena.  Today I told Laura, I should just write in abstract emotions, and she said lust.  Well, I'm not feeling the lusty writting, so instead I'm going to do something extremely easy, and tap into my happiness right now, and try to write down that emotion.  This is going to be very fragmented.  I just deleted what I wrote.  It'll only confuse me in the future.  Right now, I'm feeling pretty nihilistic if anything.  I'm about to play viedo games for a few hours to clear my mind out.
