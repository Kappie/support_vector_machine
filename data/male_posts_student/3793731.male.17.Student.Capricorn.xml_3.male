My mates and me decided don´t get out the train at the same train stop like allways and we decided get out the train at the capital train stop. But a train stop left, we had to get out coz the revisor (the man who check the tickets) was comin' !!!!!! So, we thougth that we must take a bus to get the capital but we didn´t know where!! lol  Finally we found one and took the bus right to the capital. There we met other classmates and we were havin' fun, talkin' and....why not sayin'?? lookin' for some gr8 girls.... :D Finally we took other bus to get our village and come home again (save and alive!!!! lolz)  Well, wot do u think about this afternoom???
