And then I stuck out every single time I got up to bat, which was only twice, and that is pretty sad, because we were facing a thirteen-year old team.  And i missed the fake, 8th grade girls softball all-star game.  *Tears and sadness*  I really felt bad for Chris today, and I've decided that Kelly is on my list of people who I strongly dislike, for the time being. She just should not have said yes if she did not like him in the first place.   Arrrrgggghhhhhh!!!!!!!   Oh and Chris and I have only told one person who Conor likes. But it was not even really my fault. Chris was really the one who told Maria.  Okay fine, so it was partly my fault, but that doesn't really matter.  Don't get lost now.
