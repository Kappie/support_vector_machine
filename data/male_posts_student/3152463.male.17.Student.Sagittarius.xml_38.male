I especially liked the Dutch chocolate waffles and the French fries dipped in garlic and parsley !  Today, however, I went to IKEA, and was enjoying my meal, when a women asked me if I'd mind taking part in a survey ... Of course, I said I wouldn't mind, as it wouldn't delay me for very long ... It was very interesting ... That's all that's really happened in the last few days, so I have nothing much else to write !
