What suprises me even more is that crappy games like The Hulk, Smashing Drive, and Arctic Thunder have sold more than any of these games. Are people just insane or do they just not listen to game critics? Cause it seems like they do when you see them go to a site like Gamepro and post how they got ripped off. No,  YOU  ripped yourself off. Don't be blaming the company for making you spend 40-50 bucks for a game. Trust me, if you don't read a review these days, your vulnerable to wasting 40-50 bucks on a really crappy game. It's not the 1995's as I said5 freaking minutes ago in that other post, you can't just buy a game like back then and expect it to be amazing. One example: Enter the Matrix, OOOHHHHH!!! The Matrix! Yeah, you don't wanna spend your money on that game... "BUT MOMMY! IT'S THE MATRIX!!!" Get aclue dude, the game sucks, open your eyes to the better games out there. For those that bought Breakdown or any of the games listed in the beginning of the paragraph, then I must applaud you for knowing your games. Yes, just because people don't buy a game, doesn't mean it sucks. But just because people buy a game, doesn't mean it's good. Doesn't make sense? Just read the damn reviews! Tons of sites to recommend to you:    urlLink http://www.gamingevolved.com The bestsite on the World Wide Web, I am also a staff writer here, check out all the amazing reviews!    urlLink http://www.gamepro.com  A site you should rely on only if they are reviewing console games, they usually just go with 5/5's on all PC games so ignore those reviews.   urlLink http://www.gamespot.com Errr... a little bit on the harsher side. Honestly, i've seen some good games go down the drain in this site. But they know their games nonetheless.    urlLink http://www.ign.com  A great site too, check out their reviews!   urlLink http://www.gamerankings.com  Well, if your too lazy to check gamepro, gamespot and ign, then just go here to see the  average  score of a game from every game site combined.   Now, you have no excuse to buy yourself a crappy game. Unless, you don't know how to read.
