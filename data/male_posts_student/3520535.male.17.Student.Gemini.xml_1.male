It seems that the site itself has gotten into trouble. I've still been recieving the IMs though, so it's completely automatic. I don't know if they're real screen names of just made up ones, nor do I know how they have my sn.  Here's a recent one:   Ss11whale:  Héy you havé to comé chéck thís awsomé wêbcäm síté out, íts so PIMP!        megan.homepage.nu            kdp
