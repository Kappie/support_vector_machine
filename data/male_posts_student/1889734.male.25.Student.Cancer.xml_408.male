Mel Gibson has grown in stature with me, not only as an actor, but as a man.  It is often refreashing to discover that an admired actor actually has a brain and sense, when all too often they end up being infantile ravings fools.  Gibson showed himself to be a thoughtful man who isn't afraid to defend his views.  While I don't share his faith, I admire what he is doing with this film.  He is plowing $50 million of his own money into this, and I really don't think he gives a crap about the cash.  He wants people to see this because of his beliefs in Christ, so it is an attempt to spread his beliefs.  Again, I respect someone who does that.    But even more interesting is his determination to stick to his vision despite the shrieks of the critics.  They say the film is too violent (and from the clips I saw it was shocking), but what can be more violent to a believer than the crucifixion?  They say the film is inspiring hatred for the Jews, but who are the primary players in this region of the world at this time in history?  The local Jews did have a lot to do with Christ being 'given up' to the Romans.  Do we complain that civil war films portray whites as slave owners and abusers?  History is fact.  It was an excellent interview, and I wished I had joined it earlier.  As it is, I do plan on seeing the film.  The Christ story, even if you deny the spiritual side of it, contains power. It is important to a large segment of the population, and I am interested in seeing Gibson's version.
