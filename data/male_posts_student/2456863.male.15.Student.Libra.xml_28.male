Hehe it sorta rhymes. :)  Ohkay I'm a little better now.  Anyway I had my whole post for what happened today (It was like 3 pages long) and I pressed Post and stupid blogger, with this big error message, and I'm like woah you did not just loose 2 hours of typing...  and ah I have to stop thinking about it it's making me mad again. Anyway... I'll attempt to write it again.  I guess I'll start with last night, I stayed up until like one writing in my journal (the one on paper) and I had this idea for this cool lava lamp thing and then I was looking at my pencil I was using and it had this indentation on it and the way the light shone on it it made it look like a man standing in a shadow and think ok I have to write a poem about this.  So I think what could I write about?  Well I remembered reading the Tom Clancy book "Without Remorse" then and John Kelly, if you've ever read the book you'll understand how the shadow comes into play.  If not then I'll just explain it.  John Kelly is a guy who loses everyone he loves, and eventually turns into nearly nothing more than a shadow.  Now I'm not doing justice at all to the book, but I don't feel like explaining on and on about the book, there's enough other stuff to talk about.  It's really a good book though, you should read it.  Anyway here it is:  "Grievance" A man stands in the shadows. A boy sits on the curb eating marshmallows. A baby cries in his midst. A carriage rides off into the mist.  A man sits in the alley. A storm heads for the valley. A tourist wanders in the village. A woman begins a pilgrimage.  A man sobs on the park bench. A girl speaks to him in French. A mother watches the leaves fall. A horse gallops to its stall.  A man kneels in the rain. A raven calls out in pain. A messenger shows him patience. A man puts away his grievance. I'd never have thought it'd take an hour and a half to write 16 lines of a rhymer lol  Anyway what made it hard to do was not just the rhyme pattern, that one's obvious, but actually there were 7 criteria that each line/stanza had to follow.  I'll let you see if you can find them.  After I wrote that, I was thinking, and I thought, hey maybe one of the reasons I have so much fun writing this late and it turns out actually good is that my brain turns off the part that normally says "No No No silly, that's just crazy" because it has to turn it off before you start dreaming cuz I've had lots a dreams that made no sense at all when I woke up they were so crazy but they made perfect sense during the dream.  Maybe it allows me to just write and not worry about how it will turn out.  And after that I began working on my CD again, and after finishing going through my 770 songs on Fernando and finding I had about 70 songs chosen, I decided it would probably have to be a multi-disc set. :P  So then this morning I wake up and think "What time is it?" as usual and then "Please let there be no school" and then "Do I have to get up?" and eventually I did drag myself out of bed and downstairs to the shower, and had a nice warm one (not as warm as I prefer, but ya know the shampoo says you're not supposed to use hot water, its too drying... lol) and then I went upstairs and made a bowl of oatmeal and oh my what a good bowl that was.  The perfect oatmeal... lol... Just the right temperature, hot but not too hot, just the right consistency, like pudding almost, but it was a little too runny at first so I added some brown sugar and that made it a little sweeter than it needed to be, but it was still perfect.  Well after gobbling that down and going down stairs again to put my contacts in and brush my teeth, and going upstairs for my socks and watch, and down stairs to leave I was running late.  So I hurry out the door and when we get to school I remember I left my trombone at home.  But I didn't really care.  And then before school I was just sitting around and Seany asks "So you get your permission slip for math league?  It's today you know"  And I'm like "Uh um no..."  and he's like "Oh so you're kinda screwed then huh?"  And I totally forgot that it was today, but I think ah who cares so I miss it.  So then the bell rings and I go to English and we read "Fog" by Carl Sandburg, one of my favorite poems in gradeschool, and then like 2 minutes before class is gonna end, this lady comes in and she's like "I need to see Ben out here" and so I go out in the hall and I'm thinking oh great I bet this is about forgetting my trombone at home today, and my mom's here to give it to me and then she says "we leave for math league in an hour do you have your permission slip?" and I'm like "Um no I kinda forgot" so she's like "well you HAVE to come." And I'm like "I HAVE to?" In my affirmative-yet-jocular voice that I can't really explain, but she didn't pick up on it, and she says "Is your mom or dad home?"  "No my dad's at work and my mom's teaching" so eventually she ends up first calling my house then church and talking to the secretary, then driving all the way to church just to get my mom to sign this stupid permission form.  I think she was a little pissed by the time she was done with me.  I never really figured out how you can kill yourself doing geometry anyway...  So me and seany are waiting in the commons and we decide to play that dot game where you take turns making lines and when you make a box you put your initial in it, and I almost won, if only noah hadn't told seany his little tricky move, which made it impossible for me to win.  So then we all loaded onto the big Marshfield bus and headed out.  And we talked on the way, I don't really recall about what, but I think it was geometry.  I don't remember too much about the ride there.  Well we all got out and went into the university which reminded me a lot of UW Stout, and down into this stairwell which reminded me of an art museum I was once in.  and so we sat there until just before 11 and talked some more, and seany and I wrote notes to each other on super sue's graphing calculator, sean's in Spanish and mine in German.  And it was really awesome neither of us had any idea what the other one was saying.  Oh and this guy had his iPod with him and it made me wish I had my Fernando, but he wasn't charged then anyway so he wouldn't have been very excited to play any tunes.  So we went up the stairs to the testing room, a very big, strangely designed room.  The walls were fancy like at a lot of Colleges and Universities, but the overhead lights were more "modern," also common in colleges and universities, but usually not in a room like this.  It's hard to explain but it just didn't go together.  Anyway we started the test and had 55 minutes, and it was quite hard.  Try this one for example.  6.  If a, b and c are distinct lines in three-dimensional space, which one of the following is true? a.  If a is parallel to b and b is parallel to c, then a, b and c always lie in the same plane b.  If a is perpendicular to b and b is perpendicular to c, then a is always parallel to c c.  If a is parallel to b and b is parallel to c, then a is always parallel to c d.  If a intersects b and b intersects c, then a always intersects c e.  If a is parallel to b and b is skew to c, then a is always skew to c  The answer was c.  Did you get that one?  I did.  You see they're not necessarily all three coplanar, but if they're not then they form 3 planes... and I'm probably just confusing you more.  So then after that we all piled back in the bus and went to Arby's and I had no money cuz I expected to be eating lunch at school today.  But sean was nice and bought me some curly fries and I wasn't all that hungry anyway so that was enough.  And we're talking and eating and sean's like "Ya know I think the practice worksheet was easier than the test" and noah's like "Yeah it had the answers on it" and it was REALLY funny., but you kinda had to be there I think.  Yup so we got on the bus (yet again) and drove home, and just about everyone slept, even though we really weren't that tired, from just math. But we slept and then we got back and I can finally say I beat R and M to band :) Yay :)  And during band I told reid about my perfect bowl of oatmeal and he said he had one like that too. Isn't that just awesome? And since I didn't have my trombone today so I played the invisible trombone and it was a very fun hour, for band anyway. (I never knew we sucked that bad though) And they needed someone to play cowbell, but mr carroll wouldn't let me or reid do it :(   And so we got home really early today too since I had all my stuff with me and then I came down and started writing this and talked to jenni some before she went to the library and now i'm talking to bobbie and emily and I've run out of things to say. So goodbye.
