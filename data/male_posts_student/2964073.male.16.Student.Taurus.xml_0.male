As we know from experience, the official  representatives of the search engines don't always give us  the best advice as it pertains to ranking. We decided to  check out this claim using a statistical analysis to find  out if using commas in your keywords meta-tag had any  affect on ranking on Yahoo. We also studied Google to see  if there was any affect on that search engine.  Here is the methodology I used to answer this question. I  gathered the results of the queries naturally performed  last month by myself and four associates using Yahoo and  Google. I then fetched the pages and looks at any keywords  meta-tags on the listed pages. I tallied the results for  the first 8 rankings on both Yahoo and Google (keeping the  results separate) and then converted them into a  percentage of the total results for each search engine.  Here is the graph showing Google and Yahoo results:  http://searchenginegeek.com/graphs/df03.gif  (Note to webmasters: Feel free to hot-link to the above  graph or even copy it to your own site.  Also feel free to  remove this note.)   The X-axis shows the ranking (from #1 through #8) of the  search engine results in the study. The Y-axis shows the  percentage of domains that contained commas in the  keywords meta-tag.  The first thing to notice is that roughly 40%-50% of all  pages in the first eight rankings have a keywords meta-tag  with commas separating the keywords. That really doesn't  tell us much about the ranking of such pages though, only  the general distribution of pages with commas in a  keywords meta-tag in the top 8 results. Still, I was  surprised that the percentages were so high. For several  years, the general consensus was that no significant  search engine even utilized the keywords meta-tag (this  was before Yahoo switched from service Google results to  their own). With that general consensus, I expected that a  vast majority of sites had dropped using this meta-tag.  However, over 40% of top ranked sites continue to persist  in their use. I find that interesting.  The next thing to notice is that Google showed absolutely  no ranking difference between sites that use commas in the  keywords meta-tag vs. sites that do not use commas in the  keywords meta-tag or have no keywords meta-tag at all. The  ranking correlation was an exact zero on a scale of -100  to +100.  Yahoo's ranking correlation was a -28 on a scale of -100  to +100 for pages having commas in the keywords meta-tags.  I generally treat results between -35 and +35 as  insignificant (don't not affect ranking or the affect on  ranking is small to insignificant). However, since Yahoo  recommended using commas, I did find the -28 result  interesting. Once again, it appears that the official  representatives of a search engine are steering us wrong  (at least for purposes of ranking higher on their search  engine). This result indicates that using commas is either  insignificant or if there is any significant affect... it  is NEGATIVE!  Advice: Don't use commas in your keywords meta-tag. Pages  that use commas in the keywords meta-tag do NOT rank  higher and there may be a slight negative affect on Yahoo.
