And explain why I would want to drive up to Nisswa, pick up you and Chris, drive to Brainerd, turn around drive back to Nisswa, pick up Pammy, and drive to Brainerd. About the trash: in your car, you never asked to have it taken out, and, I don't think that I ever left anything in your car. Now, how was I being an asshole to Chris? I was acting like I always do to him. Also, I don't get a "superiority complex" every time Pammy rolls around. I'm sorry if you think that, but I don't. Chris has a pretty wierd way of "calling" then. I may have thought it was funny until I saw all the pop all over my car. But I am sorry for not hanging out with you. Although, I don't lie about things except for that one time. That was because I didn't want to deal with your guys' shit at the time. I do resolve to try and be a better friend, although I don't agree with some of the things you are saying.  Now, The Empire Strikes First. I didn't buy it to get music cred or anything. The only reason I bought it was for myself. I wanted to see if I liked it or not. Is that a bad thing?
