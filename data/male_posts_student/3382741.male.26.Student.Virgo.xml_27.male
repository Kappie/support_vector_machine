David and I are still doing well and are happy.  I am still working and making WAY too little money.  I am going to seriously look for a new job (a second job becuase I just can't make enough money on "student" jobs). .... Wow ... nothing else to talk about.  I still haven't started back on EQ tho I am still thinking about it.  I have been real tired the past couple days for no reason.  I feel a general frustration with life ... not enough money .. not able to plan things becuase of too much uncertainty ... it's starting to get to me a little.  I know things will be fine and work out .. they always do .. but untill I am a little more stable its just going to be tough for a bit.   blah (if you haven't noticed this is my favorite word)
