Fuminori finally called and we went to Sharkys... lots of beer, clams, fish sandwich, wings, fries... I came home quite full, but not really drunk. Yuengling is not very strong.  Now playing: The Casualties - "City Council"  I had weird dreams last night. Greg Graffin of Bad Religion was playing a house party full of fat people. Then there was a trial / dissertation defense in like a European style court. Then a weird dream about peeing.  I woke up in time for some of Teen Titans and then went back to sleep!  Now playing: The Living End - "Silent Victory"  I just had a tasty turkey sandwich with fries.  Ok... so today, I need to read and get some writing started.  ***
