That is quite an accomplishment.  12 years of schooling in the marvelous Issaquah School District are culminating right now.  3 more days of school.  Damn the Lakers.  Damn Roger Clemens.  Pistons are still in the driver's seat though.  And the Mariners aren't good anyway so it was a surprise to see the score 1-0 as the Rocket left.  And Hiram Bocachica earned a few points in Tyke's book for taking out the second basemen on a possible DP.  That shows some good smarts and smart, hard baseball.  Just like it should be played.  If you didn't see the AB with Ichiro, it was very enjoyable.  But that isn't all that was enjoyable about today.  As was aforementioned, today was the last full day and the first day of "finals."  Tyke started a group test today in math and finishes it tomorrow.  Then in weight training Tyke passed his squat test.  It was pretty easy.  And then came 3rd and 4th periods.  Nothing went down then.  Just yearbook signing and some movie watching was it.  Then came the last lunch at school ever.  Not literally at school, but just the last lunch period.  They went to Pie because it was pretty fitting.  And it was a free lunch for Tyke so that's good too.  Then came 5th and 6th period finals.  In 5th period Tyke had quite a bit of work to do on projects.  Man, his work was laughable.  He turned in 3 projects (plus his entire folder just cuz he wanted to) today but they were so shoddy.  He was supposed to paint one thing but instead he used Crayola markers and he free handed some drawings that need rulers.  It was just classic last minute Tyke work.  Something to be proud of really.  Cuz 5 points (out of a 50 point assignment) is better than no points.  And that is the truth.  6th period was even easier than 5th.  Just working on the scavenger hunt.  And Tyke spent most of his time just copying down the answers that were on the poster.  He has like 11 answers left.  64 done.  So he already has like a C on it probably.  That's the best he's done on anything in there for a while.  Then the class just sat around and tried to get 1/2 to do his little bet with a student right then but he said he was gonna do it at the softball game after school.  After school, Tyke and Skippy played in the Senior v. Staff softball game.  It was fun.  There were like 20 some players for seniors though which meant that they had to split up into two halves and then the girls got to play the whole time (which can get a little gay just cuz sometimes they don't even want to play so why force them and then not let guys who want to play get the opportunity).  But Tyke made a few nice plays.  Oww, Bocachica just made a great diving catch but his wrist totally got bent backwards.  It looked somewhat painful.  But the softball game was fun and it was hot.  Then Tyke came home and had the house to himself for a while cuz his parents were busy til later.  But his dad brought home dinner and then Tyke went to meet his mom in Issaquah to do some shopping for some videocamera supplies and other stuff for the Europe trip (which is a freaking week away from tomorrow!!!).  Tyke has to pack within a couple of days.  That's going to be so weird.  Especially cuz it will be for so long.  Well now the night is over.  Tyke's eyes still feel a little weird.  He woke up this morning and couldn't see out of his left eye and then it started to fade but he still had a spot where he just couldn't see cuz it was blurred.  And both of his eyes were dry and itchy and pretty red.  The redness has improved but they still are dry.  Let's hope that goes away tonight.  Oh yeah, Tyke got prom pictures today.  He has a nice awkward smile in the pose that was used for most of the pictures.  The black and white ones were way better Tyke thought.  He actually had a decent smile there but nooooo, they had to use the other one.  Oh well, it isn't that big of a deal.  Next...
