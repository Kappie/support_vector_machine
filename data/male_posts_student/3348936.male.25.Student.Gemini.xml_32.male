But I get paid to tomorrow so that ends soon.  Work has been moving along slowly and then I recieved an email to say some important samples would be arriving this week.  I have been waiting for these around 3 months.  Then I suceed in doing a double transformation and  isolating a clone.  This has taken 2 weeks.  Additionally, I got my first chapter back from my supervisor.  He started our meeting with ' To be honest Simon I thought that this would be crap, but actually its very good '  and I have only got a few corrections to do.  One of which I had already spotted and changed.  Everything is going so well........
