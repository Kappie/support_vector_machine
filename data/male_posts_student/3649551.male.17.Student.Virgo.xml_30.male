Well first of all, I stole the idea from an incredible book called, "Blue Like Jazz." I don't remember the author's name, but I highly recommend reading it. But back to the tagging system. That's really how the mind works isn't it? You connect the person with a concept even if they're really not connected with it. Like how I refer to Scott as Old Man Scott. He's really not an old man. I just think of him that way. I don't know why. But I do. I think it makes writing about people more fun. It gives the reader a better impression of them. I mean, if I didn't give someone a title, you'd be left with your preconceived notions about people with that name based on experiences you've had with them. Anyway, I thought I'd just explain the ideas behind my weird titles in hopes that the system will spread. It'd be interesting to see how many different titles could be attributed to the same person. Like if I told a bunch of people to think of a title for a specific person, and they all came up with different ones. That'd be great. I wonder what title people would give me ... nothing flattering, I expect.
