Okay, here's my little rundown:  --   English : Easy; churned out the usual crap for the essay  Biology : WAY TOO EASY: the way the other tests were and how she tried to prepare us, it was almost unfair   History : Easy. World History? I laugh at World History.  Spanish : Easy; she was very kind and barely covered anything.   Religion : Same stuff from 4th grade stirred up all over again.  Math : My weakness: I don't think I failed, but the forecast is not sunny, ladies and gentlemen.  --  Today I saw  Harry Potter 3 .  It was really good, the cinematography and effects and all. And the actors were great. The set was, as usual, TERRIFIC. I watch the movie just for the set sometimes. Additional bonus: it wasn't as childish and maintained interest.  The only problem (and a major one, sort of) is that they shaved down and mixed up the story so much, a lot is assumed and it's out of whack. My opinion is that the actual  movie  part of it makes up for that. So, I give it  4 1/2 STARS  and a recommendation to go.
