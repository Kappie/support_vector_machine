I'm actually thinking of quitting biking and taking up baseball again, perhaps on a Woodbury team, and perhaps on Will's team.  Reasons you ask? 1. I suck at biking (haven't won anything), but I enjoy it. 2. I used to be good at baseball (doesn't mean I'm bad now, because I just haven't played in, erm, years), and I enjoy it. 3. Biking takes more commitment, and I barely get to go on practice rides, let alone race. And in the races, I suck. I get dropped off the back and can't keep up. 4. Biking also requires much more driving than an in-house baseball league.  I don't know if I'll really be trading in the ol' Orbea for a uniform and glove, but it might happen.
