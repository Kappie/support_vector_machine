Last night we went to the dusk till dawn show at the drive in to see four movies, then we had to go to my grandpa's to take my grandma and get a gift fro my grandpa (it's his birthday soon) and make dinner reservations for his b-day, etc. etc. so I didn't get any sleep! Also, only one movie was good. Since I had to go with my mom and sister, the movie weren't all that interesting, but I'll do some reviews when I feel like it anyhow.  The movies were New York Minute (the new Olsen twins flick), Cinderella Story (with Hillary Duff, so you know it sucked!), Catwoman (not much good to see there besides Halle Berry in leather), andTroy (the good film)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
