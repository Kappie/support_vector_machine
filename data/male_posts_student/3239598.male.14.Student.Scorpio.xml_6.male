I liked the crowning, disliked the rosary.  It interrupted my gym class, but it was worth it.  Well... hmm.  Yeah, I don't even know what I'm doing here, I don't have anything to write.  Michael had a box of matches and he gave me one.  Then, I gave it back to him and he tried to strike it.  That didn't exactly work all that well.  My desk didn't exactly have the texture it needed.  Hillary's sister is bothering me... she needs to go away.  GO AWAY, MADDY!  That's better.  I'm kinda sick to my stomach right now... no need to worry though, I'll be all better later.  I have a game tomorrow, against College Prospects.  Oh, joy.  And, I'm the starting pitcher (i think).  Then, I have a game Friday and I don't get to go to the dance or the movies at the least.  I should stop complaining.  No, I should just shut up all together for the time being.  I sound a lot smarter when I stop talking.  Yeah! Bye.  ~JACK SPARROW~
