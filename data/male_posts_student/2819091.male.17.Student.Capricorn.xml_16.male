       
      I sit in my chair, Thinking, thinking... Not even blinking. Always wondering...  What would it be like if was charming?  Always imagining...  What if I was good-looking?  Always day-dreaming...  What if I wasn't the one cowardly screaming?  I know that this is pathetic,  I know that this is wrong.  Yet I find myself doing it. Thinking, thinking...  Always dreaming...  Never ending. I mustn't think like this anymore, I've had it...  I keep on saying it like I mean this.  I must move on.  I always say it, yet I don't really it.  She is gone...  No, she'll always be with us... In memories.  Damn it, why can't I live?! Why can't I breathe?  I do live and breathe... Only difference is... I'm in restraints.  Damn it...  Damn.
