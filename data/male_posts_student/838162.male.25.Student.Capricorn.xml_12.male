Unlike  urlLink her  I think just spending time on my blog and reading other people's blog (as well as to collect ideas) is a good way to ground myself. I've been getting tired of running the  , chasing down my news and other sites of any interest.   As those of you who have been   with me on this blog from day one would notice (yes you...you know who you are), I'm slowly adding stuff as I go along. I'm sure this is the case with any   in the early days but I thought that I should let those people who do read this blog (yes, thank you the two of you again, hands down now...thanks) to bare with me as I slowly add all these upgrades. Still deciding what kind of stuff I should add. That sidebar really looks empty at the moment. Hope to get it all settled down soon but I know thats unlikely. I just love to tweak things. Never really trully happy with some things and yet there are stuff that once I get it the way I like it, I never change it. I think it depends for situation to situation. For example, I never touch my handphone settings again after the first day when I get it the way I like it. And yet i never leave the software on my Rig or PDA alone.I'm always trying out new ones when the old one works fine. I guess it's the want to find something new.  > Netscape 7 looks good BTW, but I think I'll stick with IE6. Pity, I was expecting something more, can't stand Micr0s0ft  >  Or it could be that I'm just weird.....hmmm wired weird...cute  >
