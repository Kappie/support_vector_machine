Churchill:    Madam, if you were my wife, I'd drink it.     and    Bessie Braddock:    Winston, you are drunk!       Churchill:    And Madam, you are ugly. And tomorrow, I'll be sober, and you will still be ugly.      urlLink Bessie Braddock  was a Liverpool MP during the Second World War.   It was hot again today. I just stayed inside most of the time and read  urlLink 'Sharpes Waterloo '. It's an excellent book, one of Bernard Cornwall's better Sharpe novels, I think. I'm also reading Geoffrey Ashe's 'Mythology of the British Isles' that I got yesterday. Facinating stuff.
