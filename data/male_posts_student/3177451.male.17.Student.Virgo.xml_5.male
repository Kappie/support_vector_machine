I got a little down about this in 6th period when I realized that this would be the last time I would see some of my friends from Dunedin. Ugh, I'm such a dork too, I had my sketchbook and could have asked people to sign it, but I forgot. So now I don't have my friends' signatures or anything to remember them by, except for Chris's which I remembered to ask him for in 6th period. It was kinda sad cause he wrote that he will see me when the next school year starts, but unfortunately, he forgot I'm going to CHS next year and didn't realize that that wont happen. -_-
