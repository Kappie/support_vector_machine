I'm just tired of everything again...school, track, guitar, games...ehh it's weird. I still want to be fast though.   I was going to put Alex Alex Alex all throughout this entry, but Alex would think I was stupid again or something.  Logan track meet was cool. I was really trying to pump myself for the 100, but I got only a 13.6. Blah. I won my heat though...of two people :-D Then I got a 29.42 or so for my 200, which is decent. It was hailing and windy as fuck though. Logan forfeited the last third of the meet, but we gritted our teeth, steeled our resolve and finished it. Haha no actually, Beller forced us to do the rest. Then we went to Tapioca Express, Tammy hitched me a ride and her mom made a left turn in a right turn only zone. Silly Asian parents. They also forced a strawberry pearl drink down my throat. OK, so they bought it kindly for me. Same difference. It was fun, we have a really cool team, that loves to...uh...read Chinese comic books.  Meteora is cooool. Buy it everybody. Become a proud Parker Brother! Hybrid Theory EP is the best though.
