Song dedicated to O level pupil : It's in Jap..don't mind downloading it from me through email or IM.  Real : by Shifo  Nagameru sora no shita Sorezore no mainichi ga maguru Kagayaku hoshi no shita Sorezore no omoi ga machi wo terashite iru  Boku wa taikutsu na no ni Nakete kurunda Kiga tsuitenai ne Boku ga itsumo omou koto  Kikoete iru yo Todoite iru yo Boku no naka no sekai de Tsuyogari dakedo Sunao ni narezu Itsumo karamarawari suru Demo, daiji na no wa "Ima, soba ni iru...Kimi no Real"      English translation :  Under the watchful sky Each of our days come and go Under the sparkling stars Each of our thoughts light up the city I'm only feeling bored But it makes me cry I don't realize What I always think Yes I hear you, Yes your voice It reaches the world inside me Acting tough Unable to be honest Never seeming to get anywhere But the most important thing Is the realityOf you here with me...     Not much done today...the sec 1 mock election sucks...yeah...they sucked...no, not just that they acted stupid on the podium, but they threw sweets on the sec 1...( god...they are implying that they are asking their opponents to vote for them...that was so stupid ).   Next comes PE....Mr.Singh did not come today, and we had Mr.Ng for PE...Interestingly, I saw a wet, dead bird at the shooting range while on the way to the Fitness Corner. After that, I rested on the Sit Up station and looked at the clear blue sky....I didn't imagine that the sky was so blue just now! It was very beautiful indeed...I wish I can share that moment with everyone.  Went back to class and we had to do Structured Essays for our SS. The class was pratically chaotic, as most of my classmates aren't doing their work.  After recess, we had our freetime. I did my Chem Prelim Paper and nearly finished it...but then, the teacher collected...I guess I should do faster..
