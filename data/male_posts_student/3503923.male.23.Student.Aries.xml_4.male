You've heard it all before. The stream-lined you donning a catsuit will purr and woo, persuading men that slender chicks no longer poo. Someone in the desert once, promised the earth, and all within, only if you bowed to him. When Mrs. Melton Mowbray releases her latest info pack on dieting will you die trying to achieve a new look? On her video, your own eyes will see, that watching your weight will keep you lean. No fuss to be honest, only a few minor alterations. To 'feel great', there is no need to emigrate, just calculate your fat burning rate. Your room by now, a science lab, walls cluttered with graphs, instructing you how, pointing the way. Eyes fixed on your weight, constantly watching, all you begin seeing is weight. Wait a minute! You're telling me, I'll 'feel great', when all I'm doing is focusing on my weight. How many points can I have to keep me on track? A muffin here, a Donut there, eat these and I'm falling back. You can enter the calorie count, but be sure, that this is the steed you wish to mount. A clapped out mere, blinkered and blind, trotting behind the roulette ball, to spin in the merry-go-round, round until your head is spinning with points and pounds. Is it worth believing that weight loss is achieving? 3 pounds down, thundering applause!! They pat you on your back, say your doing great, 'fat camp' coaches lifting you up with praise. When all the while, a pie chart recording the calorie count, sends signals to your brain; 'Mouth. Begin. To. Salivate.'.  Slim fast, quick as you like, instant success with a few shakes. Hocus pocus, no effort at all, rabbit out the hat, check it out; 'I'm no longer Fat!' Hey presto, before and after, now my life is smiles and laughter. They told me it would be fast, overnight transformation, back to size 10 at last. Itching to appear in front of the mirror. It will finally tell me what I want to hear. 'Mirror Mirror, Does my Bum look BIG in this?' 'Tiny, stay here a while longer, minescule, look how pretty you are, infinitesimal, the world around you is big, microscopic, meet with me, I'll testify to your beauty. I'll be slimming fast, into my ideal past. Shedding pounds, before your eyes, losing excess, gaining ground. No time to wait, or a second to delay, instant remedies will save the day.  You on the diet bandwagon? Did a dietician in his guru form promise you the earth? Did the nutritionist sell you a piece of earthly wisdom? Sell you the dream ticket, only to be seated behind a pillar. Do we not adhere to wisdom, because in our folly we reckon that wisdom is held by experts. The sole property of people in the know. "We did not follow cleverly invented stories." If they did not follow, I shall not follow either, whether celebrities do or don't. Goodbye to 'Hello', thumbs down to 'OK', farewell to the Glitz, nothing but the superficiality of the rich. Fantastic fad diets to seduce the weak, proposed for financial gain, can you smell? This plot reeks. Your experts are "Experts in Greed", fulfilling their need by supplying you a supplement feed.                           Metabo Ultra Max  HOT PRODUCT!              a natural dietary supplement to help your body speed up  your           metabolism and burn fat safely - lose upto 10 pounds in a week...                             1 month supply Only £19.50   "What is the Hollywood Diet? The Hollywood 48 Hour Miracle Diet® is allegedly a special "Miracle Juice" (can you really say that and keep a straight face) that has been scientifically formulated (oh boy, should sarcasm mode be turned off or on), and designed so that in just 48 hours you will cleanse your body (of what) and lose up to 10 pounds (of muscle, I guarantee it)! This mad as a hatter plan is said to have been created to give your internal body a vacation, wash away unhealthy toxins and fat, and give your digestive system a much needed break."  What would Fatboy Slim see into the situation? He would lament at the schizophrenic nature of our society, the double standards, and willful hoodwinking of one's self. Dieting we should hope, would lead to some improvements, maybe some weight loss. More and more people are sucked in by the popularity of dieting, while all the time the rates of obesity are soaring. An interesting correlation. Is it about health, or purely image? Because some image freaks out there on 'healthy' diets rationalise their way into the battle cruiser, to partake in a night of intoxicating over consumption. Who are you kidding? Slightly ironic you may find, that on an amble down the Asda aisle, you may find a whole range of 'Weight Watchers' cakes. A 12-pack of mini muffins, with a negligible amount of calories in each cake. (Fat Free, so insignificant and small, low calories, in fact great for you). 'I'll take 6 multi-packs!' My face can have a feast, down the hatch in one, the jaw work and remote fiddling will burn away the flab. Negative calories, an excuse to eat, you will be controlled by the master who you decide to meet. Still dying to diet with Mrs. Melton Mowbray?  "For a man is a SLAVE to whatever has MASTERED him."
