Would it be fair to the child that the mother eats food that the baby might not like when it grows up? More importantly, would it fair to the mother to change her eating habits to give the baby a choice.  What I am trying to say is...Let's say that you eat chicken while you're pregnant, now wouldnt that be forcing the baby to eat chicken?  What if the baby turns out to be vegetarian, can she REALLY make a claim that she is vegetarian, when the foundation of her life; her initial growing process was done on chicken and fish?  I am not pulling towards either side, but it's an interesting thought.  More to come........
