We both have been staying up to like 5 am and dilly dallying around, which is extremely not healthy but what does that matter, we are the youth of the nation,  We dO wHAHteVA wE WhANt!   Tonite has been the first time i have slept when the sun was not out, which is bad.  Yesterday and the day before, continued," "," "," "," "," "," ", ( i think thats how you do a ditto)(i think thats how you spell it, thats how they spell it on pokemon)(ditto that is)  I just got done reading garretts xanga and i feel bed that he couldnt go to his concert, i know how much that meant to him.  I thought the whole augie conversation (the first one) was ended with garretts ticket garunteed, sorry garrett.  And why not get mad at her, she gave it to someone else, release your anger and xanga it (doesnt have the same feel to it as blog it).  I know i would.  Well hey, there are some really good concerts coming up that the triad needs to participate in.  MUSE/THE CURE, TRAIN/I FORGOT, and some others that are great.  And i found out that i AM going to wisconsin this summer, but not for long.  Im only going to be going for like 2 weeks at the end of july and coming back on like the 6th of august i think.  I also think im going to be able to make the Muse concert, so kat, dont fear.  Im kinda worried right now because my foriegn friend Andrea (an-dre--a) is having a goodbye party to kick her back off to florida with a bang, then well, to germany.  And its going to be tonite sometime ( cant find the card ) but never frear (yes frear) because she is having two of them!  Today and tomorrow so thats a relief.  Also i just always could call "Andrea who rocks" (diff andrea).  Eh we shall see what the winds of time blow in.  Going to be FUN!  Kaufen! (you have to buy now)(i think)  Gotta go but ill blog or call later.  FIREFLY MUST LIVE ON IN A MOVIE OR SOmething.
