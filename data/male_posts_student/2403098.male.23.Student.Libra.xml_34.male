Don't do this rain/snow/sleet mixture that just makes it look like a 7-11 slush when all the flavor is sucked out of it.    The good news is, tonight I get to watch Chicago (one of my favorite movies) with Lauren (one of my favorite peoples) and drink wine (one of my favorite beverages) and sit next to a fire (one of my favorite natural disasters).   The goal of the day, however, is to make this apartment not look like a laundry basket.  In order to allow someone else to cross the threshold of my door, I need to definitely clean up a tad (hamilton).  Speaking of Tad Hamilton, thanks for bringing it up.  I did see that movie with my grandmother.  She thought it was cute, and that the main character makes "comments like mason makes."  Which was funny.  I think she's amused by my sarcasm, that I don't even mask when I'm around family.  I want to be old and amused by everything.  Wait just kidding, I don't.  I'm young and ammused by everything, that's better.  I have NOTHING to write about.  NOT A THING.  I'm going to go to the gym now, and buy some fire wood for the extravaganza that will be my evening of wine and movie!  Ciao bellos.
