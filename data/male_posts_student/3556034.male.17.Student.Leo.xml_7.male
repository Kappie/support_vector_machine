Then I went to the sunglass hut and bought me some $180 Armani sunglasses for $40. Pretty good deal huh? Anyways I'm real excited that I'm finally getting some money for me to do whatever with and probably later on today I'm gonna go back to the mall and see what else I "need" with what I got left. I'll post again soon. Peace.
