I guess I am just going to let the domain name expire and go on.   Brian stopped by last-night to say hello. I guess he was in the area - at least that is what he said. We talked a little while, I got lit, and we checked out the mr.bill DVD that I got as a wedding gift from my boss. It was an odd little DVD.  He want to buy the Time Killers arcade machine for $160. We will see, he is supposed to pick it up tonight and bring me the money. It's a cool game, just ready to get it out of the garage, and I wasn't into it that much. Just thought I could make some scrilla from the game - oh well. I really wanted Altered Beast anyways. I am at work - a little bored, but I feel accomplished this week. I got alot done at work, I had a good time the other night with a little barbq going on and it's soon to be the weekend. a matter of hours.   I have to come up to work tomorrow and change out the tapes for the back up. No big deal - I might run up to school for a while are maybe learn some shit...
