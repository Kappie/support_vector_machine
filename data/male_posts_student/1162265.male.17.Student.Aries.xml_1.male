School was pretty average today, we had a boys only meet against Seton Hall Prep, which we ofcourse lost, but at least I suprisingly got to swim, my second worst event!  The 400-Yd Relay!  Needless to say, I was slow as sin, although, I got a good flip-turn the first time, according to some people.  So, I guess all things considered I'm getting better, but still not good enough.
