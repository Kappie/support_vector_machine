Actually, nothing happened. But that was probably the best thing that could happen.  Ms Lee basically didn't ask us why we had disappeared yesterday; in fact she did not even ask us for proof of our illness, excuses or goodness-knows-what.  What was interesting about today? Bala paraded with his traditional Indian costume for Racial Harmony Day with the company of two (quote) "cooperative" girls - he can't get the Civics thing out of his head, I think.  A narrow majority separated Bala and Ms Ng for the fashion parade (Ms Ng had a very neat baju kurong on herself), but in the end Bala had the best of both worlds - the two girls and the victory of the parade.  Then, of course, a magnificent performance from the Chinese Orchestra. Actually, it was only the flutes that were performing.  Then a very memorable performance by the Malay Cultural Society - if you were there you would have agreed, surely. Whilst doing their dance one of the dancers - who, apparently in her excitement, failed to keep her hair down, literally. One of the dancers probably failed to keep her artificial long hair-tied-into-a-bun properly tied, and what happened was that the next moment we saw a bun of hair on the stage floor and the dancers doing their thing around it.  If that wasn't real hair, at least it provided us with some really good laughs.  The day sailed by quickly, but was probably because I was distracted by the psychadelic fashion parade (and some wardrobe malfunctions) in the lecture theatre.  Certainly, it's easy to forget Maggie - her voice may not be the sweetest, but she fades quickly into the background of my attention.  GP lecture was, as usual, the most interesting one - if only Econs lecturers were that fantastic.  Not that I got a wonderful distinction anyway for my GP.  What's ironic is, I passed Economics.
