Im glad for the solidarity and consistently after school, but now I'm just waiting for something big to happen once again. I'm still in some parallel random sorting thought zone, trying to sort my whole group of friends into groups, and you know what, I think I'm almost there at last.  Anyhoo, was a relatively average day at work, although I'm getting increasingly pissed of with my new "boss" Becky, she's just become incredibly patronising and now should officially die - slowly - in her own filth. Apart from that it was ok and I came home to the great news that Manure (Man U) had lost 4-1 to City. Wrestlemania tonight (yer I know I'm sad but who cares). I guess I'll post later on about more important stuff when anything happens to come to light in this ever increasingly warped mind of mine - BuBz
