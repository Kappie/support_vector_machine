I suppose that i shouldn't be doing this, but its just so damn boring over here. I only work a small amount per week and have way too much free time. I have even published (almost published) and entire web comic, learned 12 songs on the guitar, and programmed 2 games in the time i had. and i have only had 1 month of free time. god...kill...me...now! So yeah, I'm gonna be bloging here from now own. mainly because i'm just to lazy to make a blog site of my own. I don't have anything to blog about for this post, so your out of luck for now. adios.    -Jim
