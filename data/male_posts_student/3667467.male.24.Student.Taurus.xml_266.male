One worker there ran up to the drive-thru window and yelled "HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE A FREE CINNAMON DOUGHNUT?" He was pretty hyper. As my friend Richie described it, "It looked liked the teeth were falling out of his head." Too much sugar for that dude. So I guess Richie is a friend...he's really my brother's friend...then again that means I only have like two friends if I can't count people I've met through other friends. Richie said goodbye but I didn't really say goodbye back; I had a doughnut in my mouth. Creme-filled. Mmm.
