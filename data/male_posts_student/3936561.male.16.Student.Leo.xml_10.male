He's the most arrongant, self-righteous prick ever to be forced into my eyes and ears. It all started when (this was in '01 or '02) I heard that he wanted a college to be boycotted because their recommended reading list included a condensed version of the  Koran . So anyways, I was bored, and I happened to see that the  O'Reilly Factor  was just finishint up on Fox News. So I watched Mr. Self-Righteous Whore respond to e-mail. One he got was something to the effect of, "I'm a 21 year-old liberal who enjoys  the Factor ." His only response was, "good for you, but you're a bit young to be locking yourself into one ideology." I just wanted to throw the nearest solid object through the TV. Anyways, onto other things:  I had fun at my godfather's and my grandma's. I bought a copy of a new book by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter called  Time's Eye . It cost me $26.99 plus tax, but it has a CD with a lot on it, so I don't feel  too  bad about spending that much. Also, I bought a copy of Grisham's  The Pelican Brief , because I've seen the movie and liked it. And I bought a 2005 desk calendar with a bunch of stupid quotes. For example:  Secret Service Agent: Mr. President, you're urinating on me. President Lyndon B. Johnson: I know I am. It's my perogative. (After Johnson stopped to relieve himself by a tree on his Texas ranch)  And I joined a multi-mod clan that spun off out of my TFC guild. So, from now on, I'm refering to my guild as Organized Chaos, and my clan as Dei Mortium. I've put new links up to both of them. Anyways, enough for now. Later!
