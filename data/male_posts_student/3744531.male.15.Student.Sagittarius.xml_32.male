They only give a bad image sometimes, which probably give them an extra sale of albums, bad the songs they play are awful....  letÂ´s just give an example: Limp Biskit, in the begining it was one of the top 5 bands of rock that were at the top of all popularity lists...but then they sing song about other things that was not "cool" in that moment  Other bands that are not very known have a lot of pretty descent songs, or not?  Please comment about this theme...
