Possibly great but yet it's not really a great kick off. Edmund's outing was really weird. Never expected something like that from him. Tomorrow would be one of the first few steps of Priority. Relating voicecheck on Linkin Park's One step closer, A place for my head and In the end. Interesting setlist, yet it is harder than I thought. Stressing every inch of my face muscle on their tracks. It was pretty easy from other bands.
