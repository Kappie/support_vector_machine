You can't laugh or sneeze and to top it off, you have go to school. (Glares at Ben and Andy). Ok Ben i can understand, he realli pushed himself beyond the limits on the 800 and he didn't look to good afterwards, but Andy just because you were clumsy enough to stumble and screw up your ankle after the 200 doesn't give you the excuse not to turn up to school the next day. Everybody who ran and turned up today was completely wasted i.e Stevie, Almo, me etc. I'm writing this during DT (probably why i was banned last time by evil lost DT teacher). Speaking of DT teacher, he won't get off my back for some site he claims i went to during the last DT lesson, which is impossible because i was stuck in B8 all lesson. Anyway, I'm writing this during DT because i have nothing else to do. I might blog during commerce if anything happens between now and 5th period.
