My stomach hurts, my mouth is dry, and I think I'm gonna take a shower... NOW, unless someone (hint, hint) signs on within the next few minutes.  About that thing yesterday, I am still shocked... But only when I think of it... So I guess it's better now.  I hope I'm gonna do something social today... And if not today, then hopefully tomorrow!  Tomorrow I am getting together with Toby and Noah to work on our graduation rap.  I think we're gonna use the beat of Nas's "One Mic".  Anybody heard that? No? Okay.  This concludes my entry.
