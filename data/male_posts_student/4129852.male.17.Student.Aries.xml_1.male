I Understand The Song mad world after last night... i had a dream....Sam was walking away from me I was sprintin Ive never ran so hard or fast in my life.. I felt like an olympian.. I couldnt catch her... i couldnt get her attention she was slipping away..... then the ground seperated there was a hude cliff between me and her I kept running I knew the one thing i wanted was her so I lept... And i Failed on the way down i looked up and sam blew a kiss at me. then a bullet wound appeared on my chest..... I was thinking on the way down I realized this is wonderful if i cant have her I will just die.. i then saw myself it was like i was watching myself fall i closed my eyes put a smile on and enjoyed what seemed to be like 4 minutes of falling it was beautiful.... a few seconds Troy appologized for everything he has ever done to me... and i died  I find It kinda funny, I find it kinda sad The Dreams in witch I'm dieing are the best Ive ever had  Good Bye -Rem
