Most people wouldn't look at taking summer school as an option at all, but if i take French 1 ill be able to graduate on the recomended diploma. But my other option is to go to Canada, and maybe even get a summer job up there. Thats what i really want to do. But im juggling in between these. I am really confused and right now, having some guidance would be a huge plus. Cause im stuck and right now i have the flu. So until i get over this flu im gonna veg out. But i dont have much time to come to a decision. Go to Canada, or stay here and go to summer school...
