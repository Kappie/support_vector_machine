The.. well, I'm not sure exactly what language it is, but it's got funny squiggles in it... has a better option scheme and general interface than the English version!! Carrying on the aggression towards the language choices, the website has decided that English was no longer invented by the ENGLISH, but it was invented by the Americans, and that, there are even TWO different variations!! I wonder what type we learnt in Secondary school... *Growls* I was really looking forward to that movie, but now im planning to buy a copy oif the dvd and teach the dog to do it's business on top of it - it's so bloody crap!! lol. This is the only website that i can be bothered to check today, mainly because it's put me in such a foul mood, which is a right shame cause earlier I was all happy, happy with smiles on my face... Anyway. General Blog: Mostly tiresome day today, retirement RUINED by having to get up before noon! However, I do have the chance to win an iPod, so go-me!! Went to Merry Hell with Lucy today, fairly interesting shopping trip, in that I've learnt that "posh-shop" might replace my broken sunglasses if I take them in... if not, it means finding another bloody Â£10! After Merry Hill I took the bus to Pensnett (remind me NEVER to take the 222 again!) to see Stephanie :D! Woo! Sorry for calling around unexpectantly hun, it's just I always enjoy to see you! WOW! Prom thing tommorrow!!  The perfect oppurtunity to start that Sex-Survey Dad suggested... mwuahahahahha. Have Fun Ye All! Martin J. PS: I can't believe there's no alcohol tomoz! It means I don't have anything to blame for mine kicking Mullanal in the balls (presuming of course that it's afro has not squashed them from existence, that is)... ah well, never mind, the school would probably think it a public service and congratulate me...
