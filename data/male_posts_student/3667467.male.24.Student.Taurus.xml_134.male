All soft on the inside and with big pockets on the outside, with a giant hood that makes me look like i'm in a Naughy By Nature video. It's also a large size, meaning that hood can make me look like a scared turtle if pulled over my head. I hope to use this jacket during my upcoming trip to Europe, where I will spend a number of overnights on a train. I envision sitting in my seat, mummified by my coat, oblivious to the continent speeding past me as I get some well-deserved sleep. Most people are not energized by coat purchases, but this is my first new one since 8th grade--yes, 8th grade!--and to have a coat without missing lining or buttons is like manna. Maybe tonight I will sleep on the floor, in my new jacket, like a seven-year-old girl to her new swimsuit.
