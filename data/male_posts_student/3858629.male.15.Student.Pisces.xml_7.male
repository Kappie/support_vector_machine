I feel like I did something yesterday, but all I can bring to mind is sitting at home being bored. It's a strange feeling...   Six Feet Under  was on last night. A sigh is being released as I think about the show. It's so brilliant. And... oh, I just love it. I love everything about it. I love the humor; I love the various romance stories; I love that there is no set main plot but everything sort of falls together and occurs around everything else, like in real life; AND I love Ruth, but you already knew that.  Today I had to wake up at 9:45 to go to work at 11:00. Something weird in my mind always wakes me up before my alarm goes off... which is good, because that sound ranks amongst my biggest pet peeves.  Well, I went to work and the lightning and rain ( I HATE this town!! ) caused for the pool to close, so I suppose a pool cashier would have little do anyways. I guess I like my job, but I don't really. And I hate saying that I work at a pool but I'm not a lifeguard. People seem to expect me to be a lifeguard - why, I don't know. I don't exactly have the 'look' of one who lifeguards.  Mallory, my supervisor, called me back at 3:00 to come in and cashier again, so I went in because I need money and I figured I'd be bored at home anyway since 'Days' and 'Passions' were over and afternoon TV is the absolute worst.  The reason I was called in is rather humorous: Louise, the old woman who was supposed to be cashiering but she saw that the pool wasn't open so she drove off and even though the supervisors chased after her car, she didn't halt. That woman is insane, I swear!  I arrived home at about 7:00, talked to my grandma on the phone, and then I ate dinner. And now I'm sitting at my computer chair, wondering why if I'm going to watch 'North Shore' or not since I've missed so much of the series anyways.
