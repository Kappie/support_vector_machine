    
       The day started off horribly, by My dad condemning me to an afternoon/evening (4:00-10:00pm) of hellishly boring looking at a flower or two and celebrating the fact that my parents can drink wine...jeez. The nail in the coffin though was when my Dad said : "I know that you don't want to go, but it'll be fun. There'll be  Morris Dancers . Blimey...anyways, I went to school and did some doss lessons which no-one really cares about and I have the all-important job of being the title writers helper...I don't get to even write "D-day Landings:1806 or w/e" but I do get to help to come up with the ingenuity behind it...lucky me eh? Then I had a three hour break and totally pwned at Heli Attack 2 with 107 helicopters floored. Come on the me...So apart from that quite a boring school day, no homework...which is good. When I arrived home though, some uberblessingness happened upon my poor defenseless soul...Firstly it was raining so I didn't have to go to the garden/morrisdancefest, secondly ,my MP370 arrived...it possesses all the uber1337ness of my set up (black and silver monitor,black and blue lights alienware,black everything else) being uber crystalblue silvery and tranlucent shiny black. And it rulages...all that for doing well in my exams...how rare... I promise I'll have that crappy flash trailer up tomorrow, it's finished but I can't be bothered to upload it right now...so I'll give you it tomorrow!
