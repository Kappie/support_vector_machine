Oh, and I said a quotation related to Matt Woolf that Melody thought was funny and so wrote down.  Maybe she will start quoting.  'Course she doesn't have a blog, so she can't blockquote, but w/e.  I don't know how Loren and I survived through those pioneer days before blockquotes.  Steph thought I was annoying today in my making fun of her.  Whadayagannado.  Oh, and I saw the sex episode of "The O.C." that she wanted me to see, that was pretty good.  Yesterday, I saw "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring," this movie from one of the Koreas, probably the lower one, with Daniel Waldinger.  It was cool.  Steph deplored me for not going to more popular movies/theatres; I deplored her for wanting to exercise indoors.  Some people are like that.  The Steph part, that is.  Anything else...?  No.  Well, new song.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.
