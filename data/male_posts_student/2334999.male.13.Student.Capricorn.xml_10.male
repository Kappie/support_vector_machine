I bought hair wax just now 'cos my hair was starting to look like crap but it isnt so much of a big deal rite...  With the release of Doom3, I've read 2 reviews about it so far... 1 from PC Gamer and the other from gamespot... PC Gamer rates it 94% while gamespot gives it 8.5 (which is 85% for those who suck at math)... Why the not-so-good review from gamespot? Well, first of all, I belive that Doom3 is a kind of an old school shooter. It was a remake of the original Doom back in the 90s so by now, its pretty old school... Its just run around in the dark, use flashlight, shoot anything that jumps out at you from the dark and repeat the entire process... I mean, if I wanted this kinda gameplay, I would rather go get Painkiller or Farcry, maybe even Halo! Gamespot belives that gameplay is a much more important aspect, as earlier mentioned. And the graphics, even though just as important, is secondary to the gameplay. The gameplay became rather repetitive and most of the time, it was too dark to appreciate the game's graphics anyway... It's kind of ironic actually... I mean, the graphics are for you to check out but its too damn dark and even if you wanted to hang around and ogle at the graphics, you'll soon be attacked by creatures from hell (literally)... Doom3 was overhyped... But PC Gamer seems to contrast gamespot's review... The only bad point that PC Gamer offered was it's bad humour! lol! I mean c'mon, its a game, who cares about humour! Other than that, PC gamer was praising Doom3 about it's graphics and sound and atmosphere and why-you-should-upgrade-and-get-that-new-video-card-and-that-dolby digital 5.1-now... In case you dinnoe what a dolby digital 5.1 is, its a sound system that places speakers all around you to get you fully immersed in the atmosphere, mostly tense and scary... Yup, in case you havent realised until now, Doom3 is scary...  The story goes like this: You're this guy (forgot his name) and its the year 2156 (or something like that)... You're on some Mars spacestation and its your first day on the job... Well, its not long before all hell breaks loose, literally... Some reminiscence-of-half life-catastrophe occurs and the entire station gets plunged into darkness... Everyone else becomes zombies and whatnot and only you and some other guy survives... So for the rest of the game, you go around staying alive and the other guy, some captain, guides you along...  Im defintely not gonna buy Doom3 'cos 1: Its scary... Its dark everywhere and all those monsters from hell... Im gonna get nightmares man! Yep, im a wuss... Go watch the exorcist if you're that brave than play Doom3 with the lights off...  2: My com most likely won't be able to play Doom3 well... I only have a Radeon 9200! It wont be able to generate such graphics or even play it at a high framerate... and lastly, 3: Im a halflife supporter :D  Well, I can only hope that HalfLife2 doesnt turn out to be a flop like Doom3 is with gamespot... But on the average, if you calculate, 94+85 then divide by 2 = 89.5! The average score for D3 is 89.5 which is quite good actually... Halflife2 received an 80+ score from PC Gamer like last year... But due to the HL2 code theft, Sierra/Valve decided to postpone the release... One of the gripes was that it had basically the same guns and secondary uses... I hope that they improve on this and by the time they're done, HL2 scores better than Doom3... *Crosses fingers* Gdluck HL2, for now, I can only wait till September/October
