I can write novelettes, poetry, and short stories in other languages, yet I can not  write you. You make me sick sometimes, but I love you anyways. It's fun to get you because I know it means something. Sometimes I'll get an e-mail and I'll delete it without reading it. I rarely if ever throw you away without at least looking at you. If somebody decided to put in the effort to use you to speak to me--and believe me, it is an effort--I think that's totally cool. But why is it so hard for me? I'm so used to being impersonal, I suppose. If I opened my eyes a bit and spent a pocket of change on a "God Bless America" stamp that I don't even really like, I think I could do it. It's hard to make an effort sometimes. It's hard to show someone you care. You really do make me sick...but it's a good kindof sick. Thanks.
