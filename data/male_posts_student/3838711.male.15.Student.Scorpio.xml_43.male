Guess the heat subsided already as of now..  School was pretty fine, just that I skipped PE lesson, due to the headache of mine. Just sat in a corner. Felt kinda hot in the head... and sleepy, of course.  After school I took bus 100 to Serangoon MRT station.. was planning to take the MRT to Kovan, and change to 113. But somehow the "feeling" of walking home from there caught me.. as a result, I saw myself walking home under the scorching sun, but I still felt good, headache already took a turn for the better... Wonder why I'm walking home these days... There's just this urge... and well, enjoyment.  Walked past PLMGSS when Joshua and Benjamin spotted me. Crossed the road to talk for a while, they teased me for having a motive (uh.. see girls they claim ?) to walk home by there.... (-.-") Dont know what they will say tomorrow.... Sigh.. >.  Headed home, got a call from mum to see my godfather.. so i bathed and took a cab down to Toa Payoh where I caught a train to Novena to meet my mum. Went to Tan Tock Seng hosptial, saw my godfather in a poor state... all skinny, and unable to talk.... Sigh.  Went to meet Aaron at Novena, went to AMK Funland to play some ID. Met a guy whose name I shall not mention, ew. First time he ever lowered his ego and talked to me with a smile. At that moment, I just felt we had switched identities... Lol..  And Shiro was there too. Played a bit, headed to Macdonalds at 7 pm. Darn fast food... its getting really tiring and heaty eating this stuff.... my fever is gonna come back soon... eeks.  Came back home on a cab, with Aaron. Studied till now, blogging, and heading to bed ASAP for my beauty sleep. Damn... I dont want to flunk my Physics and Chemistry test tomorrow... lol...  Nightz !
