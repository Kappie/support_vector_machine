This was taken a month ago by my gorgeous girlfriend Donna at the Elton John concert at Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen. We were trying to amuse ourselves between the support band finishing and Sir Reginald Dwight (Elton John) coming onstage and thought pulling silly faces was a great way to pass time. Well, hope it gives you something to laugh at anyway.
