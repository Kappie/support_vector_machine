Last time I was up this late (last night) I made pancakes, this time I have Belgian mini cream puffs, so good!  only about 8 bux at albertsons for about 30 of them, in the frozen dessert section in case anyone wants to try them.  If they have the mini eclairs, those are better.  Personally I could go for a Jack in the Box's Spicy Chicken Sandwhich...  followed by some x-box.  Oh ya, I didn't like that "discussion" we had on friday, everyone got so off topic so much, go from taxes to well-fare, to zoneing laws... ~CT (goin to get some food from J in the B)
