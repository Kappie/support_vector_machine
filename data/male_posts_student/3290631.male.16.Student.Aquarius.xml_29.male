They spend more on fast food than movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos, and recorded music--combined."  "The idea that you are what you eat had been enthusiastically promoted for years by Den Fujita, the eccentric billionaire who brought McDonald's to Japan three decades ago.  'If we eat McDonald's hamburgers and potatoes for a thousand years,' Fujita once promised his countrymen, "We will become taller, our skin will become white, and our hair will be blonde.'"  "The real power of the American consumer has not yet been unleashed.  The heads of Burger King, KFC, and McDonald's...they're outnumbered...A good boycott, a refusal to buy, can speak much louder than words.   Pull open the glass door, feel the rush of cool air, walk inside, get in line, and look around you, look at the kids working in the kitchen, at the customers in their seats, at the ads for the latest toys, study the backlit color photographs above the counter, think about where the food came from, about how and where it was made, about what is set in motion by every single fast food purchase, the ripple effect near and far, think about it.  Then place your order.  Or turn around and walk out the door.  It's not too late.  Even in this fast food nation, you can still have it your way."
