That, however, is not the entire fault of the books. They teach us how to make better changes, but it is up to us to MAINTAIN them! That is why we need to remind ourselves constantly about our principles and life values and whether we are living by them. Today, I shall share with you  13 Secrets  which made Anthony Robbins who he is today and also how to make those changes stay!   SECRET #1 : Ask good questions.  SECRET #2 : Intelligently ask for what you want.  SECRET #3 : If you want to be a success, care deeply about what you want - enough to do whatever it takes  SECRET #4 : Never be interested in achieving success. Instead, find compelling reasons that motivate you.  SECRET #5 : Develop passion in your life.  SECRET #6 : Learn from other people.  SECRET #7 : Create value for people  SECRET #8 : Believe in the impossible and it will happen  SECRET #9 : Associate yourself with successful people.  SECRET #10 : Take responsibility and make things happen  SECRET #11 : Always look for ways to make things work.  SECRET #12 : Master the streets  SECRET #13 : Make the habit of making decisions more often   I hope that you will deeply benefit from the above. Now, I shall teach you how to make changes last. Basically, it follows 3 Steps.  Step 1 :  Raise Your Standards  Anytime, you want to make a certain change, the first thing to really do is to RAISE YOUR STANDARDS. Tell yourself what you will NOT accept and what you WANT to become.It will reinforce your actions to making long-lasting changes.  Step 2 :  Change Your Limiting Beliefs  If you raise your standards and don't believe you can meet them, you've already sabotaged yourself! Our beliefs shape every action, every thought and every feeling we experience.  You must develop a sense of certainty that you  can  and  will  meet the new standards before you actually  do !  Step 3 :  Change Your Strategy  Actually, once you have done the above 2 steps, you are already next to success. However to keep your commitment, you need the BEST strategies for achieving results. Once you have set a higher standard and get yourself to believe, you simply  will  find a way. Learn from people who had succeeded in what you are doing and it will save you lots of time and resources.
