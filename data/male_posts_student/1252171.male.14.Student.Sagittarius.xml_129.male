" We could ask you the same question," she said, eyeballing the teacup ride behind me. "Oh, this? Yeah, I run it. I also run the arcade here." "How can you run two places at once?" asked Camo. "It's easy when it's just your imaginary self. Oh! Gotta go. The teacher's saying something important," I say, as I vanish. Katt and Camo move on to the roller coaster. "There's no one here," says Katt. She then sees a note that says:   Be back in 10 minutes. Please use coin-operated locking system until I return.  Beth  (another of my friends)  Katt looks up and sees a slot that says $0.25. "We'll just come back when she's here," says Camo. So they move on. Then, they reach the arcade with me standing outside. Katt walks up and says, "So, ya got any good games?" "Sure," I say, " there's a really good one here called Dance Dance Revolution. Only $0.50!" "We'll try it," says Katt. So they try the game, over and over and over and over and over and over. After they've run out of quarters, Camo says, "Man, I must of lost at  least  ten pounds! Hey, what's that?" They go over to the prize grabber machine. "Look, Camo!" says Katt, "We can win almost every fun object in the country here!" "Yep," I say, "you can win something as small as a super ball here to something as big as a giant trampoline!" "Try it, Katt!" says Camo. The claw reaches down and grabs a small capsule. When she gets it, Katt throws it aganst the ground. As the smoke clears, only one thing can be heard....   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-
