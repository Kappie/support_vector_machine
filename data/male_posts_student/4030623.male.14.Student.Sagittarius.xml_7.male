I bought a book called "Bourne Supremacy" by Ludlum from NBS after a having a splendid TT dinner with my family...Hmmm.... Then in the late afternoon, I got a free homemeade pizza from my cousin, who is taking HRIM.... So lucky....  But the bad part is, tomorrow's another bad day waiting patiently for me... Monday.... I really wish I'm "home-schooled"....  Another good thing happened this day is that more and more of my classmates has known what Jed "..." are doing-"backstabbing" , like Jean and Ryan and Lady and others....  I am therefore foreseeing a war on II-5 (Jed vs His victims-Kimberly).... How interesting!!  Meanwhile here are some few quotes, check them out....  "Everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life" -- John Barth  "You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you" --Eric Hoffer  "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself" -- Leo Tolstoy  "God comes to the hungry in the form of food" -- Mohandas Gandhi  That's all for now..... Smell ya later!--(christian)
