Then I took the most complicated ways home, just so he could stress out about stress that 'almost happened'.  Definitely not fun, am I strange for not enjoying driving?  No matter.  Thesis paper is bothering me even more.  I'm convinced on the need to change my topic, and just gave up on Native Americans, it's far to late in the year to do this amount of digging for scraps of information to build a thesis paper from.  I'm just throwing in the towel and going to work with black people I guess, I'll dig into the house library, as well as the public one and hopefully make good out of what's good.   What else.... Oh, driving sucks.  I drove to Taco Bell afterwards, sucked.  I drove to Pathmark, sucked even more.  It just isn't cool, it's like convincing myself marching band is fun. haha.
