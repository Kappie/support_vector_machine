I learned yesterday that all life is made up of stardust. I was surprised. I asked Stacie, which is what this open-minded community of scholars I'm in has to call her (we're not allowed to use our teacher's last name because she is a "scholar" along with us. Go figure.), what she thought about the Bible, creation, and Christianity. She said she believes in "god", but she is open-minded about it. She then proceeded to tell the class that the Bible was only an interesting mythology book. I was, needless to say, quite angry. I went to the men's bathroom afterwards and just stood there praying and telling myself, "Think happy thoughts. Think happy thoughts." for about 15 minutes. Then today, she announced that the only reason she likes winter at all is because the constellation Orion is visible, and it makes her feel good inside to know that he is watching over her. Uhuh. That's nice, Stacie. Thank you for that helpful bit of information. I should edit a song by the Newsboys and give it to her when GSP has concluded. "... Orion is watching over you, as always, you are loved whatever you go through, he's right above you...". Sigh. I am praying that God can use me to be a shining light to brighten this spiritually dark place. Thanks for your prayers. If there were a song to describe what I want to be while I'm here, it would have to be "So Bright" by Superchic[k]. That's all for now.   Stand up, God gave you the gift of life It doesn't happen to you, you happen to life Stand up, do something with your light You're a a light on a hill, you're meant to shine so bright So bright, so bright, so bright, so bright, So bright, so bright, so bright.  - Superchic[k] - Last One Picked - So Bright
