Then I started weightlifting until my muscles burned. First weightlifting day. That's about it.  See? That wasn't so hard!  Now back to the All Your Base.  For those who don't know what this already is, I'll refer you to this link:  urlLink All Your Base   Okay, now I totally ripped off the stuff and made an action/drama comic. Don't expect anything too funny, except the poor English that I mocked. The first 6 slides will show you the story, the ones after that are the ones I made.  Okay, click  urlLink here  to see it.
