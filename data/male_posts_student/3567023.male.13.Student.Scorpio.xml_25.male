"Ms. Genius" looks down her nose at Nathan-which doesn't work because he's taller than me-what kind of rank is Ms. Genius anyway??? Alison also says hi to Dana, and thinks she should be Daine, because that's who she is.   Alison says Puffin to Garrett and muffin to ryan, and nothing to parker.  Sorry parker.
