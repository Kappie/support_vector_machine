The funny thing is, I don't really know as what. I mean, a study leader? A leader in my school? Something more? I just don't know. A lot fo things have been popping up in my life about what a leader should be, and how he should act. And the one that's always there is that a spiritual leader needsto be grounded in God. I mean, yes you can be a leader without God. You can be nice, have charisma, people like you, and you're a "good" person. But without God, all you are is an empty shell. And it's even more dangerous, because as a leader, people look to you for decisions. They follow you. You may hold the salvation of these people in your hands. So you better be right with God. Otherwise, it's not just your life you end up ruining, it's everyone that looks up to you. So, I ask that you all would pray for me. I expect many challenges in the future. A lot of spiritual attacks. I mean, Satan doesn't want another General in the army of God does he? I want to stay true to God. Focused on Him. But at the same time, I want to develop the characteristics of a spiritual leader. I believe that God is calling me to this, so what choice do I have but say yes? Yeah, the road will be hard. Yeah I'll ahve to change some things about myself that I may like. But it will all be worth it. Because I'm doing God's will.
