View the readme for the latest info, I'm not going to post a screenshot as it isn't an amazing addon but I hope you use it.  It will be improved for a later release.  I have three links, a installer, RAR and ZIP, so you can choose the one you want, please be patient as I only have limited bandwidth.  Installer:  urlLink Download Here  ZIP:  urlLink Download Here  RAR:  urlLink Download Here    Counter for downloads:   urlLink Click Here   Enjoy!  -Tweak
