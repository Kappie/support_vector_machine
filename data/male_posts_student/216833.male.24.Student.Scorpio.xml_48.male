After that I headed over to Insomnia, where we were just lucky enough to have someone let us in to get the paintings.  Alex was there about an hour before and had taken down most of the art work.  From there, I went home to hang with mimi for a while before she trappled off to work around 1.  We went to the local tex-mex resteraunt and had a weird waiter.  He gave you these blank glares that confused me.  He either had  no thought at all, or some evil plan to poison our food.  After mimi left, I drove aross the fucking country to my brothers house in white settlement.  They should change the name to black settlement.  Took me about an hour to get over there.  I had brought some coke, but brian had no ice.   No big deal - had me a few keystone lights and started painting their fire place.  Not finished yet.  Left there around 4:30pm and went to stop by my parents house to pick up the carpet steamer and just to say hello.  Hannah was playing in her pool - jumping around like a crazy kid.   Mom showed me her pumpkin plant in the flower bed in front of the house and she took me to the backyard to show me her carrots, squash, and tomatoes.  Growing plants just rocks.  I can't wait until I can eat food that I watched grow.  I finally got home, the sun was falling fast in the west.  I poured me a vodka/cola drink and started in - watched a bit of TV.  Then james from denton calls.   - - - -
