This program, from StarDock, is the best way to avoid minimizing everything to get to your desktop and open something up.  This one allows you to open it right on the spot from whatever window you're using.  Once you download this software, all you have to do, is wherever you position your Object Dock, place your mouse over that side of the screen, and your list of programs comes up.  You will need to add your programs, however, but, doing so takes a matter of 2 minutes.  It's really handy, because it also comes with a weather tool that is built right into the docklet, and you can customize it to give you your local weather.  Cool, right?  As far as customization goes, you can add anything...documents, folders, programs...anything you want, you can add it.  You can also change the color scheme to match your computer's theme, if you'd like.  It's also really easy to use.  Now, ObjectDock has its downsides, too, like most programs these days.  Sometimes, this thing will just crash, and you didn't do anything to cause it.  But, that seems to be the only minor flaw that I have seen so far.  I've used this program for about 2 or 3 months now, and its only crashed about 5 times, out of the hundreds that I have used it. And also, if you have it positioned to the right side of your screen, don't think about using the scroll bar, because its not going to let you. It's a really cool little program, and it's just the start of my new series of downloads, called "Customizing Windows."  Look for an installment of Customizing Windows, which will also include sites sometimes, every day for the next few days.  We'll give you reviews of products you can use to help you, which are free, and, which aren't.  So, stay tuned for that.   Pros  +Nice interface +Easy to use +Lots of Customization options +Easier and faster than minimizing everything to get back to your desktop.   Cons  -Crashes on occasion -Bothers you when you're in the middle of things.
