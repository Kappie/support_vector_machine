Canada Day rocked. I went all out, with tattoos, clothes, etc. I was a walking Canada. We all went out to the Marina until about 11:30 to watch the fireworks, then we went to a party afterwards. I didn't get drunk though, I had one Mike's Hard. Afterwards we went out to Robyn's camp and I spent the night, and yesterday there. I am so sunburned now. And heatstroken. :(  I am grateful for the fact that I don't work until Tuesday. It's a Godsent in my eyes :) July 4th weekend in the USA. Therefore, I don't have to work!  I feel like writing tonight, and I think I will. Helps me to get my mind off of so much, and the more I write, the more I understand. I never really understood how hard it actually is to understand yourself. Poetry is the wavelength that allows me to build a "bridge" between my thoughts, and how I can express them. My ability to write also relies strictly on my mood. I can't write anything "happy" if I am not. It's how I feel that determines the subject.   Sometimes I don't even know the subject until I start writing more in depth. I don't think, I just spill it all in large amounts and boom; another piece of work. I really think it is cool though, to speak directly from the mind without any hesitation. It's just an urge to let it all out. Whether or not it's inspiring.  At the time I have no feelings to write. I will post later.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Later.
