I dislike doing work and waking up early...but with what I am doing now, It jsut seems like a wasted summer thus-far.   urlLink Hy-Vee  is taking up quite a bit of my time as well. Tomorrow I work 10-2 then 3-7. A cool 8 hours. Im getting about 25-30 hours a week. Im happy that I have money...but mad that I have to work. All-in-all...its a fair trade :)  This summer sucks...put simply
