Yeah so firt I'll give Chedward credit for finding this blog host... you should check out his page too... http://seventheclipse.blogspot.com/ ... He's a funny funny man...  Yeah well I'm going to steal yet another thing from Mr. Chad... I'll tell you my weekend... or parts cause its pretty boring. I'll do it the organized way cause i'm like that...  Friday: School wasn't bad... Who am I kidding it sucked like it always sucks. But hey only 11 school days to go. After school I mowed a lady's lawn and got $20... not bad for about an hour of work. I went home and just hung around... played a lot of GTA: Vice City cause I just purchased it tuesday or something like that.  Saturday: I woke up and thought... Hmm More GTA: VC... Then I ate food and got ready for the Memorial Day Parade... I'm a sexy sexy Trumpet Man is the one and only SC Marching Band and proud of it.  The parade went well... other than full whool uniform in sun and hot weather, an hour of waiting, a long walk playing a song I can't play sitting down and feeling band about making chad later than her already was for Cabaret cause he drove me home... I'd have to say hes a good driver... a bit conservitive at times but a good driver with a very nice purple Accent... its got a nice ride but horribly speekers... o well... Toxic still sounded nice on them... RIGHT. So then thats really all of the Saturday. Sunday: Woke up nice a late.  Helped my dad with some yard work and landscaping outside... Dug up some dirt and did some manly sweating... then i called up my good buddy CHedo and suggested a movie... me and him and chris went to see The Day After Tomorrow... Pretty Great Movie... GLOBAL WARMING IS EVIL!!!! the audience made the movie o so much better... WHOO After the movie, we looked at some movie posters with a Virginian woman and her volleyball playing daughter (freshman).  They were nice and all, but ha as chad says she might have been a bit tipsy... And Chad and I both agree that the daughter look familiar... He says chadicus7: maybe every school has the same set of freshman that are slowly corrupting schools all over the nation... hmm he could be right... this years freshmen are particularly evil... and tall. I came home and talked to some people online cause other than Duck Tape and GTA: VC thats all I do... my parents and my sister Renee were watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with Jack Nickleson... scary man... I caught the tail end, its looked like a pretty good movie. Monday: Hmmmmm Nice Long sleep... til like 11, I think it was about 10 hours... o boy was that nice... I got up and just hung around all day... then around 5:30 all 5 of my family members when out to Prospectors... MMMM good food... Just before we left Julie Cutler (sorry if i spelled that wrong :( ) came in with her family... sorry again, but she looks a lot like her litterl brother and sounds a bit like him too. I got home and did homework... thought I had a lot but didn't so that made me happy! Then I came to see who might be online... talked to chad some, saw his BLog and liked it so here I am with my own for all the world to see! Tell me what you think, i'll be putting more pictures of Duck Tape stuff and maybe other stuff on here soon enough...   -Dan V
