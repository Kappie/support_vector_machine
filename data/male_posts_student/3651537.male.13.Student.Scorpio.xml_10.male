That I admit freely. It's still very fun and I made it to an adult using only school time(ccan't play at home).  On Friday, after National Day Celebrations(BORING) I went back to my old school AGAIN. As ever, I saw my old teachers and saw a bit of the inter-house sports. Shark got thrashed HORRIBLY. What a disgrace. We won last year lor...must use the old tam to thrash them. GIve them handicap or sth lah.  Went for CS(getting better)and lunch after that. I couldn't have eaten at the canteen as it was closed early due to Mational Day celebrations. So, had to eat some fried beehooon that was absolutely HORRIBLE. Went to primary school's friend house after that. As ever, enjoyed myself on that day.  I feel that all thse music idols should be cut down on. I encourage personaltity, so liking a singer or their songs is not a problem. But camping 2 weeks for a good seat at their concert? How did the guy ever help you? What WILL he ever do for you? I mean, the closet you can get is...him waving to you and saying hi as he gives you his autograph? What's the point in that? GO for concerts and get their albums, I don't care. It's good. Just dont...be...crazy.
