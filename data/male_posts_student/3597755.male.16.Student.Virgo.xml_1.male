He accepted my commands and the day after I wrote my first piece.   A week later I write my second piece, post it and watch if it is shown correct. But what does my eye spot? Censure. Correction: stupidly censured words. I asked him about it and he told me that he had made a list of words that were automatically censured. My blood is still boiling. When I read that, I knew that I should resign. Haven't done that yet though, will find out ways to insult people and judge shitty music without being censured. What I will do now is explain why censurement sucks.  There are different types of censurement. A summarisation follows: * Stupid censurement Removing words like shit and fuck makes people ignorant. Have you ever used the word fuck? I bet you did. Have you heard stories of people dying after they heard/read the word fuck? The only people who are against the use of those words are overconcerned parents and overprotected kids. The parents of those kids are criminals for puting such stupid kids in society. Your kid won't become a murderer after he has learned some cuss-words. As a matter of fact, if you allow them to use cuss words from a young age they won't be using cuss-words a lot at a later age. Just because they are familiar with them. They're not new to them. Those words just are. In my opinion words as 'shitty' and 'fucking' are perfect adjectives which should be allowed everywhere. Ofcourse, those adjectives don't say anything usefull about something but they can give somebody's opinion about something. If I talk about 'shitty music like Britney's music' I don't feel I have to explain why I hate Britney's music. At that moment I think it's enough to let people know I don't like Britney's music. And that's the way to do it.  * Stupid censurement: E.g. Fuck - F*ck This is the type of censure that was used on my article. F*ck is in no way less offensive than the real word (I believe Maddox used the exact same sentance but I don't care(or Zappa did)). I mean, if you want to protect six year old kids this definatly ain't the way to do it. Fuckers who are stupid enough to censure my fucking texts this shitty way are fucking ignorant wankers.  * Stupid censurement: MTV's censurement.  This is probably the worst censurement. The way MTV censures is terrible. I don't like MTV's music but I do like to watch to shows like alternative nation (though that isn't broadcasted anymore) and top 11 @ 11. But that's not what I was talking about. My problem with MTV is that they censure everything. In the USA MTV banned the video of Incubus' Megalomaniac to the evening hours because of...yeah because of what exactly? Because of images of Hitler? Are we on our way back to 1984 that much that we are trying to forget about Hitler?  Another example: junior/senior - everybody (I believe that was the title, not completely sure. I'm too perfect to know much about those shitty songs) Some squirrel drank four glasses of something fast. After that he was shown drunk. What does MTV add? "Non-alcoholic nut-juice". I guess that's what those dipshits at MTV drink. Nut-juice. Otherwise you wouldn't get as insane as those cows. Third and last example: Madonna - Die another day: She was cut with a sword in the video along with this crappy song. MTV censured the blood out. Good example for the kids you're trying to protect. Go slash eachother open. You won't bleed. MTV shows you you won't bleed. Didn't you see?  Related to this subject is the pron rock scandal. From Frank Zappa's response to that: They lived on a whole bunch of nothing They thought they looked very good They'd never ever worry They were always in a hurry To convince themselves that what they were Was really very groovy Yes, they believed in all the papers And the magazines that defined their folklore They could never laugh At who or what they thought they were Or even what they thought They sorta oughta be They were totally empty (Totally empty) And their lives were really useless So what the fuck? They didn't have no sense of humor
