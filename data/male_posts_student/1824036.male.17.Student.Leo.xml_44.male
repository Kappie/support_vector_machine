Apparently it all started with the recent publishing of Ric Flair's book, "To Be the Man..." (which I want to read, but haven't as of yet.)  Supposedly, Ric stated that after Bret Hart beat him for the WWF Title (just prior to his return to WCW), Bret was not a draw for the Fed.  Supposedly, Ric goes on in his book to slam Bret on just about everything.  Like I said, I haven't read the book yet, but I do read a lot of wrestling websites, and the debate has been raging on and on and on as to who was better:  Ric Flair or Bret Hart?  I thought about sending my thoughts in to PWTorch.com or PWInsider.com, but I decided that I'll just state my piece here and only here.  That's right, you lucky Dojo reader!  You get an  Exclusive Drewcifer Perspective  right here for free!   Now let's see...  The very first time I saw a Professional wrestling card live was on March 27th, 1988 in Greensboro, NC.  It was the very first Clash of the Champions, televised live on Superstation WTBS.  (For you younger reders, this pre-dated WCW.  It was still Jim Crockett's Mid-Atlantic Promotion, about a year before he sold his interest to Ted Turner, who then created WCW.)  That date was significant for two reasons:  It was the very first Clash of the Champions, aired on live TV, and going on at the exact same time was none other than WrestleMania IV.    In 1988, not everyone had cable, let alone the chance to get a 19.95 PPV event.  (Yes, in '88, WM cost a mere twenty bucks.)  I was upset two weeks before the event that I would not get to see the World Title Tournament at WM (like I said, we didn't have cable)...but my mom bought me and her main squeeze of the time tickets to Clash of the Champions.  It was a nice consolation prize, I thought, but it turned out to be even better.  I was a big time WWF, Hulk Hogan, Macho Man Savage, Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake fan at the time.  I also watched Mid-Atlantic Wrestiling on TV, but pretty much considered it a minor league to the mighty WWF.  Anyway, I went to my first live wrestling event on that March day in '88.  And I'll be damned.  What an event that was!  I saw Barry Windham and Lex Luger beat Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard for the NWA Tag-Team Titles, The Road Warriors (LOD) Dusty Rhodes wrestle in a barbed-wire match against The Powers of Pain  Paul Jones, Midnight Express vs. The Fantastics, etc...  But the match I'll always remember was Ric Flair vs. Sting.  It was their first ever encounter for the NWA/WCW Title, and they went to a 45 minute draw, the end of the match having Ric Flair in the Scorpion Death-Lock (aka-Sharpshooter) and the bell ringing at the time limit.  Having been a total mark at the time, I was totally impressed with Ric Flair's performance, even though I started hating him more.  It took me nearly a week to find out what happened at WrestleMania IV. (Believe it or not, there was no such thing as an internet back then.)  Around the same time Ric Flair was going "Broadway" with Sting, Randy "Macho Man" Savage was winning the 14-man tounament for the vacant WWF Championship.  Not only that, but Bret "HitMan" Hart turned face in the 20-man Battle Royal that led off WrestleMania IV.    In August of that same year, WWF made it's debut at the Greensboro Coliseum, a long-time stronghold of Jim Crockett's territory.  WWF didn't just throw their mid-card talent, they went all out.  The main event was Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant.  It was a huge event at the time.  (I was sorely disappointed when I got there to find that it wasn't being taped or televised, but at least I got to meet Leapin' Lanny Poffo--he autographed my Hulk Hogan shirt.)  Anyway, The WWF soon started running semi-regular shows in the Greensboro-Winston Salem area.  The NWA/WCW were running monthly shows at the Greensboro Coliseum.  On the day of the NWA events, you could buy an upper-deck ticket for five bucks, and that's what I did once a month for almost a year.  And Ric Flair was always the Champ, and I hated hated, HATED him as Champ.  He'd always somehow manage to cheat his way out of losing his title, either by having the Four Horsemen interfere on his behalf, of getting himself intentionally disqualified.  And yet, I'd go back the very next month in hopes of seeing him lose the title.  Bret Hart came into his own glory a bit after my time so to speak.  By the time I hit my senior year of High School, I suddenly found myself occupying my time with Cross-Country, and my first real girlfriend.  (Trust me, if I had to do it over, I would have told her, "I love Professioal Wrestling, and I'd really like to stay home tonight and watch this new show called RAW...")   Anyway, my wrestling viewership waned for a year or so, and my attendance at live events went dormant for nearly 10 years (last March 1st at RAW).  After I started collegein the  fall of '93, I was hanging out with trouble...I mean a nice young lady in her dorm, who somehow had cable, we were watching some movie on USA, and an ad for RAW came on with Bret Hart holding the Championship belt, saying not to miss the next Monday night RAW.    I was stunned!  I asked, "When did Bret Hart win the WWF Championship?" (I knew Randy Savage had beaten Ric Flair at WrestleMania that year, and that Flair managed to win it back).  She was like, "HUH?"  and I was like "Oh yeah..nevermind..."  Anyway, in the intervening years ('93-'98), I kept loose tabs on Wrestling.  I managed to see most of Diesel's reign as WWF Champ, and Shawn Micheals' ascent to the upper echelon, as well as WCW's acquisitions of Hulkster, Macho Man, et al.  It wasn't until 1999 when I separated from my ex-wife (not the same chick from college, actually a different chick from college) that I rediscovered my love of Professional Wrestling, aka, Sports Entertainment.    I was channel hopping one Monday night and landed on USA.  Stone Cold Steve Austin was cutting a promo on Vince McMahon, and the "Corporation", and I got hooked from there on in.  Or re-hooked, as it were.  Since that week in '99, I haven't missed a week of wrestling.  Even if I missed a Raw or SmackDown! or Nitro (at the time) I was blessed with the internet to catch me up on things.   There was a point to all of this, right?  Oh yeah.  Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair?    I've already documented my Ric Flair experiences.  During Bret Hart's time at the top, I was more or less away from my TV.  I won't say either amn was a better technical wrestler than the other.  Maybe Ric Flair had a better ring psychology than Hart.  I can't honestly say.  My main experience with Bret Hart's Championship runs are from renting tapes at Blockbuster. (And yes, I did rent Survivor Series, aka Montreal Screwjob).  To be fair, Ric Flair drew more of my money than Bret Hart, but I'm sure Bret Hart drew more money from people elsewhere.  Sadly, Bret had a stroke a couple years ago, and most likely will never get in the ring again (not as a full-time wrestler, anyway).  Ric and Bret will never have it out in the ring to determine "who's the best" (although, Ric did slam Mick Foley in his book as well, and I can't wait for that to materialize).  But for my money?  Who's the greatest?  It's easy.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.
