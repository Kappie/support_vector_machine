Jackie jumped at the idea of having a sister sight to Kakutama +3. I agreed to join her new "cartoonish styled website" under the circumstance that my cartoon character didn't look like a retard. I don't understand why this is called a "cartoon" website in the first place. It is more like, switching profile pictures to cartoon versions and just talking about different things. But, I will not rain on Jackie's juggernaught of a parade. I will just tag along and ride this thing as far as it will take me.  On another note, I have noticed that this website is very... pink. I am unsure why Jackie wants to "pink" it out, when she knows there is going to be two men joining the damn sight. I actually don't care though, she is in control on this one. So if she decides to run it into the ground, it is all her.
