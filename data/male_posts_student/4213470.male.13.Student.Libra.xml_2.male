Its like he planned the test for next Thursday and told us like beginning of last week. Then today, he found out that we are going to be at a camp on Thursday and just changed it to Monday like “that”. Its like no freaking time to study. And I need the time cos I take real long to study. Anyways that started me thinking again > my life is ¼ over, and I haven’t accomplished anything!!! And wat am I doing now??? I’m studying and putting myself through all the trouble of passing exams… and that is useless to me. I wanna be a superstar roadsweeper! So what is the use of studying Chinese? Math? Science? Its just soo exasperating! I dun get to make my own choices, why cant I choose a roadsweeper course and spend my school life slacking like they do in austrailia??? In austrailia the first “graded” test is held when the kids are 18 years old! And that is obviously beneficial to the kids… take ri geps for example, the crème de la crème or what ever… of the singaporean students. They take so freaking many test, they are “smart” . But they are all so freaking weird, “vegetable brains” trained to memorize rubbish. Oh yah they are also so cocked up and all! And the moe doesn’t see all this, cos they are made out of this kinda people too! So what do people with different aspirations do? ---- to be continued.
