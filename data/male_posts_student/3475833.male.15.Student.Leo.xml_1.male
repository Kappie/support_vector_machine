The pool people were gay. Gravy for me! I had a great time, as always. Helped her dad (loo) dig trenches. Well, a trench. Good times all around. I got yelled at for not eating.  It wasn't all fun and games tho. We sat down and talked too. She got mad at me. But I think we are overlooking it, for now. I dunno. I guess I didn't collect my thoughts very well. Loo.  It was a great time. No complaints. Except for the fact that she kicked me in the nuts.. That kinda hurt. And she didn't beat me in sumo-wrestling. No matter what she says. Loo, I am just so overwhelmed right now. I love the feeling I have. Well, Half of the feeling I have. I have a bad feeling about summer and the stuff me and Alyssa talked about. But I have this great feeling right now. I geuss it it because we went outside and just goofed off. I dunno. It felt like we were friends. Good friends, no, great friends. And there is no feeling better.
