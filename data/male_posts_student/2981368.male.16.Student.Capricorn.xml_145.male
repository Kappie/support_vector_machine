Who proved their lack of basic sanity by walking down the middle of the road debating who'd get run over first...hitting each other whenever they saw a soft-top or a yellow car.  Tomorrow: the joys of English LANG. And I'll probably walk back with those 2 again. Mostly for the comedy side, partly so I can get back in time for lunch and not sit round at Joes for hours looking through random TV channels.  Wooo!
