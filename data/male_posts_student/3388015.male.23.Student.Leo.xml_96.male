Cindy made a quick trip back to get my cell phone... a very important thing.  Thanks Cindy.  We changed planes in St. Paul MN.  We got off, walked right to the new gate and had to get right on.  Talk about timing.  While walking, I quickly got some McDonalds, but this McDonalds put egg in their burrito (maybe all do), so I ended up giving it to my mom and Nola.  They like egg.  We got to CA by 2:00pm EST, 11am PST.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our backage, but Aaron was on time and we went right to his house.  Wow.. what a house.  It's huge.. has 3 living areas and 5 bedrooms.  It has an amazing back yard and view and guess what... someone has an unsecured internet wireless AP next door!  So free internet for me.  We went grocery shopping, mom bought it all (with objections from Nola, Aaron and I) and got enough food to last us 2 weeks.  We're making dinner right now.. chicken bbq, grilled vegies and salads.  I made some guacamole dip and we're snacking.  Mom is napping until dinner.  I'll post later. :)
