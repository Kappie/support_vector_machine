Yes, I'm willing to sacrifice my dignity for the entertainment of my friends.  Anyway, yea the story behind that is that I had to bribe Becky to tell me a story about her and Melissa talking about me doing the tango. I bribed her with saying that I'd let her throw a burrito in my face. However, when Becky came up to visit Binghamton this weekend, the Taco Bell on campus was not open. Thus she and Melissa decided pot pies, or better yet pot pies with whipped cream on them would be a better subsitute. Oh well... Melissa and Becky said that, that was one of their highlights of the weekend. I guess it's always nice to make friends happy.   Afterwards, I went home and showered, but I didn't back in time to wish Becky a good journey home. However, I ended up hanging around at Melissa's and proofreading her art history paper. Then it was home again to work on my own papers in the extreme humidity.  I've a little ramble that I might do later, but for now a nap sounds good.  ***
