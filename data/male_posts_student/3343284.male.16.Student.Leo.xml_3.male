     
      well planning to watch 'the day after tomorrow' (TDAT) on saturday at GV Yishun or perhaps maybe at Sun Plaza... well all that's after careful consideration that it would not  SERIOUSLY  hurt my budget for the Sentona trip on June 9...  i'm now playing some games on the PlayStation 2... namely  Winning Eleven 7 ,  Genso Suikoden III ,  Gran Turismo III A-Spec ,  Resident Evil: Outbreak    FIFA Soccer 2004 ... and also playing the PC version of both  Final Fantasy VII / VIII  since i can't find the PlayStation discs for both games... (did i lend it to somebody ???) and i'm anticipating the release of  Gran Turismo IV (end-2004 hopeful) ,  Genso Suikoden IV (Jan - Mar '05?)    Final Fantasy XII (Summer 2005... WOW ! What a long wait...)   about the other website I've constructed... I'm going to change it into something else... although I do not know the end-product will be... but it's still in it's early development stage...  it's 2:33am now... and i'm going to turn off my monitor and shift my attention to playing  Suikoden III ...  (P.S.: The Internet is a boring place to be in unless you've a blog of your own...)
