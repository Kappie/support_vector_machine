On the other hand I'm going to get a mp3 player maybe while I'm here, maybe when I get back...       But     Mum has set a study plan for me in the dying days of the holidays...    I have to do:   1/2 an hour of clarinet practice,   A4 page of Chinese, writing and stuff,   Maths stuff that I don't understand...    :/      but if I do this every day until I go home, (that's 2 weeks) I get an iRiver iHP H120...    :D    *is less depressed than before*    Meh...
