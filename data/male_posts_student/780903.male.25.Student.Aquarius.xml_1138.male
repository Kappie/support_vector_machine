Princeton has a bunch of alumni e-mail lists, about all sorts of things -- princeton-writing, princeton-career-networking, princeton-new-york, princeton-lawyers, etc.  But I think they should get even more broad.  princeton-bored, princeton-tired, princeton-angry... or even more specific -- princeton-addicted-to-painkillers, princeton-root-canal, princeton-likes-fish-better-than-chicken, princeton-contemplating-buying-new-socks.  There's a kernel of funny in this idea I'm doing a bad job of eliciting this morning.  Maybe this is a song parody waiting to happen; maybe it's a sketch; maybe it's just this, and it's just not that funny; maybe I use too many semicolons when I write.  Time to get ready for work.  Five days a week of going to work is a lot.
