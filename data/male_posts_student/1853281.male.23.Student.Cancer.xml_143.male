I very much and beginning to dislike them, they are vulgar and seem to be rather mean spirited, and i have no idea what to do. Papa seems happy, though i suspect a lot of that is simply the fact that he does not feel alone. I am glad that he is happy, but i feel like such a hippocrite reassuring him that I like her and her family when he asks(repeatedly). I feel like I can't really tell him my opinion about this woman because he is so happy and i have no desire to create conflict, my family has had so much of that as it is. I suppose i will keep quiet, he keeps saying that they will never get married or live together, but i doubt that very much, she allready seems very proprietary of his house and all his things, and that worries me.  But, nothing really I can do I suppose. yesterday did not do much, baked some bread and did some pilates and hung out with the Slavic princess and her boyfriend, who really does look like he should be summering with the kennedys at kennybunkport.(sp?) anyways. My life is not exciting. I am trying not to be green with envy at the fact that my friend K. is dating someone. Trying, not succeding so well, but trying, and at least am not showing that I am.
