You said, you didn't have the confident thatyou can provide with what i need.  Oh dear, What i need? I just need someone who will accept my care and concern. That's the only thing i need.  You give me a hope, give us a hope, a hope that will never fail. Trust me, it will never fail. I keep my words with action.   17th June 2004 Marks a new beginning, the start of our story.  Past shall be forgotten, finally I walk out the darkness of the past.  Our shared memories, I will not forget.  The places where we left our footstep, East Coast Airport Viewing Mall they will be forver there.  Memory Time Laughter Everything WE shared WE wont forget.
