Aren't you special?  You got two confessions out of me.  A party's about to start here, the first party this summer that I haven't been really excited about.  Maybe I'm too anxious.  Anxious about you, yes, but also my voice.  I think it's broken.  Yay for oversimplification.  You'll be here in not so long, and I can't wait for that.  Well, I can, but I'd rather not.  I like taking single thoughts and giving them two parts, or had you noticed?    There's so much I feel like I want to tell you, but I'm never really sure I should, or that you want to know about it.  I think that getting over self-doubt would be an important step toward not worrying.  Natch.  Party time.  More later, perhaps.
