It's a great movie, but not nearly as violent as I thought it'd be.  The whole sleeping only 6 hrs a night thing has really increased my productivity, but I'm feeling a bit tired right now.  I need to get some reading before class at 1:15.  Esther leaves NYC tonight and Andy arrives in NYC this morning.  Party tomorrow night.  ***
