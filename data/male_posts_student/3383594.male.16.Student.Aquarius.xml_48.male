For F, we made some cakes and I had to run away frm the fat pussy cat as he was chasing me. He wanted to lift me up and carry me, and yes he did tt a couple of times in front of the cls. I asked him politely "Hao Wan Ah?", and he replied "Hao Wan!". L0L! Yea, I hafta admit tt it's fun as well, but it's embarrassing. It made me look like a weaklin, who's probably too weak to walk and therefore need some1 to carry me awhile. Well, the whole cls was lookin as well as the teachers. Boy was tt embarrassing and man is he strong! -.="  After sch was our F 'O' Lvl plannin for task B. It went pretty alrite, I actually managed to do some stuff. L0L! It lasted for like 1.5 hrs and after tt I finally had the chance to eat something. I went to Clementi wif lil' pig and fat pussy cat for "lunch", it was like 4 plus already at tt time. Hehe, those 2 lil' bros of mine can be realli nice. Haha, they went to help me order food and drinks, while I waited for them at the table. L0L! Tt's wad brothers are for! Hehe.  Well, I reached home at 6pm and did my Physics b4 completing my English Presentation on Thursday. While I was doing tt, a question pop into my head. Tt question was "Wad is a godbrother?" Well, I dunnoe wad others think. For me, I feel tt if u acknowledge some1 as ur godbrother, u hafta treat him like ur veri own brohter. And no, for me it isn't for fun like juz callin each other bros. I treat my godbros wif care and love. Muahahaha, I gif them the best I possibly can. Tt's why any1 who haf me as their godbro is damn lucky! L0L! Well, of cuz I would love to get back tt same treatment, but den again, it rarely does happens. Well, care and love is all tt is needed I guess, not forgettin trust. Oh wait, maybe there's more. Hehe, alrite I'll leave u wif this question in ur head ya? Cya~ =]
