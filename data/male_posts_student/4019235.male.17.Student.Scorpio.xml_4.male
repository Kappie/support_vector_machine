The Saturday of the year in which I have my A levels. “What the fuck and I doing here on a perfectly free Saturday when I should be studying?” is what is reverberating within the hollowness of my head. Apparently it remains intangible, having no effect on the mind numbed by frequent repetitions of such warnings, not to mention the effect of the smirnoffs. Sigh, when the world is worrying about the end days, I’m wondering how the day would end…….may the day come when I possess resolve so powerful I can hopefully promote the reverberations into palpable actions.
