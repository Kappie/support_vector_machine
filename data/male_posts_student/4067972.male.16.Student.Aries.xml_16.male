When my dad put in the cable 20 years ago, or whenever that was, he drilled a hole in the side of the house near the floor and said, "we got cable now." So for my entire afternoon, i got to start where he left off and finish the job. I had to stick the cable in the house up in the attic, attach all of the connectors, drill holes from the attic to the inside of walls (one hole i drilled was a little off and ended up in the living room; i still gotta patch that), drop cable down into the walls, drill holes for wall plates, find the cable that i dropped into the wall, and connect everything. Then i had to go up in the attic again to fix one of the connections cause the cable didn't work. It works now...i think. I also added a phone jack in my room. When my dad ran a phone line in my room, he just stuck it through a hole that the carpet layer made with his foot when carpet was installed 20 years ago. So i put in a jack.  Man  i'm good.  I was on a roll. After i finished at five and ate dinner, i went to sleep. Just woke up. That was nice. My knees are sore frum crawling across the attic 500 times, my lungs are full of attic dust, and my glasses are foggy cause of the dust, (i still haven't cleaned them..i'll do that now) but i'm ok...for now anyway.
