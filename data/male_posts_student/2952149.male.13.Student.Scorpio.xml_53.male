I think a bunch of Mexicans got bored and decided to come up with a holiday. When they couldn't think of a name they were like, "Â¡Hey hombre! You know how those Gringos up in the U.S. have The Fourth of July? Well we can just pick a day like May 5th and make it our own holiday, but we can call it Cinco De Mayo! Oh well...what can you do lol.   So Stacey's concert is tomorrow and I hope I can go. It would be cool to see her perform. My guitar concert is on the 12th and Austin and I are going to play "Zephyr Song" by Red Hot Chili Peppers....yay!
