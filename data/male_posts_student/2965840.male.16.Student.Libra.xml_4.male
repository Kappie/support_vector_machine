OK i woke up at 7 this morning (are ya proud) and i couldnt get back to sleep so im like,"What fun it would be to re-anylize the effects cavour played on european unification."  That was good because i got it down.  Count Camillo Benso di Cavour played a major role in european unification throught his work as a statesman, brief membership in parliament and blah blabbah blabbityblah.  Anyway, so he was a helpful person.    Im about halfway through my european final review packet(yes another packet) and i hate it.  I need to be done with it by wednesday because thats when the final is, my first final.  Im not too worried about it though, i need to have science down because i need an A in that class.  and im tinkering between a B and an A and i cant seem to move it.  BLAH.    Summer! its almost here and i cant wait.  Im going to be making mass amounts of money because i can babysit all day long (no skewl) everyday FO-EVA!!!  Finally i can buy what i have always wanted............... The REDVINES EMPIRE!!!!!!!!! muahahahahhaha.  sorry, im stressed like silly putty.  I better be going now because this packet isnt going to finish itself!  OUtIe
