Remember all that to do over the pentagon's terrorism futures market?  this is a site that lets you bet fake money on the likelyhood of real events happening.  anything from outcomes of elections to assasinations and sporting events.  it's all based on some heavy economic theories that point to the likelyhood of futures markets giving accurate information on future events by distilling the hunches, guesses, and informed decisions of thousands of people into one number.  The pentagon's terrorism market was intended to do the same thing, but it got tanked because people didn't understand what it was about.
