You just have these days. So, all my pe exams are now done which is a real great thing. I no longer have to worry about them, may never have to do another bit of physical exercise again in my life. I was saying that last week to Katie and arron, jokingly, but they kinda took it seriously, thinking I’m gonna be some kind of couch potato. Which I rekon put them both off. On Friday I was really showing my depression at school, being quite, stairing into space, that kinda thing. Katie kept asking me what’s wrong, and I aint gonna tell her but I like the fact she asks. It shows someone does actually care about me, even if I don’t care for them much. I really want to tell someone everything. Gemma, is the latest I’ve been considering telling. She seems like the best candidate to keep a big secret and I don’t think she has a problem with gays (can I say that, it’s what I am, and yet it sounds so wrong). I just want to tell someone, female, everything that’s going on with me right now. The problem with Katie, my sexuality, my love interest. On top of all that I’ve got gcse exams coming up in like a month or two and I may soon be moving to Ireland. My life is quite a mess at the moment, and I want someone to share it with. Someone to talk about it with. The more I see gay lifestyles on the telly, the more I want to stop living this lie, leave the closet, come out. If I do move to Northern Ireland, I will seriously consider telling my friends here. Gemma, the Laura’s, Heather, and wouldn’t it be greate if Arron knew too, and it made him come out. Last week there were art exams so our tutor was moved to the textiles room, which I guess was kinda cool. It would’ve been better if I could have stuck with the girls but chris drags me anyway from them. Well, not literally, but, me and chris sit next to each other in tutor. I don’t particularly want to, I want to be with the girls where I belong, but I can’t leave chris on his own, so I’m stuck. Anyway, we were in the textiles room and I got started on reading elle magazine. God it’s good. I want to read more womens magazines, they are so cool. I can’t wait to get my own home and start subscribing to these mags. Gaytimes as well, it’ll be great. I needto stop thinking about the future though, I want to read these magazines now, I want to subscribe today, but I can’t. What would my parents say for a start. Hopefully they would think I’m gay. They certainly don’t right now. Dad’s always insinuating that I’m at that legal age and mum’s always treating me like I don’t know how to choose clothes which go. Seeing Todd’s (coronations street) clothing style the other night reminded me it’s about time I stopped following straight conventional fashion, and start going for something a little more exotic. A little more gay. I need to stop pretending I’m straight for my parents beniefit and just be myself. Read elle with my mum in the room. Were a face mask in front of my dad, run around clothes shops with my sister and friends finding cool new clothes. My dream is that one day I will sit at a table or bench or something and me and my girlfriends will rate the men as they walk past. That is what I’m aiming for. On Friday everyone was encouraging Katie to snog me, which I wasn’t happy about. I don’t want to snog her. I want to actually like the person who I first snog. Hopefully, Laura, who was the one trying to set it up, will have a go at me next week, as that will give me a chance to say I don’t want to kiss her and get a tiny bit of the stuff of my chest. Katie has obviously told Laura she’s want to kiss me, properly, and lauras trying to make it happen. I think I’ve finaly decided what I want to do at sixth form. I’m thinking maths, business, photography, graphics. Two academic subject and two creative. If I had been making this decision last year, I probably would have chosen maths, business, IT, and geography. But after really discovering my gay self I’ve also discovered a more creative side to myself. I now want a job in design. Whether it be fashion, graphic design, photography, interior design, architecture. That’s where I want to go. I think the subjects I’ve chosen reflect this. I’ve also decided I want to go to university. AIU-London looks really cool. They do degrees in all the areas I’ve just mentioned and provided flats in central London. How cool would that be. I’d be living in the middle of London, hopefully with a few girlfriends and be studying, full time, something I love. Sounds great huh?
