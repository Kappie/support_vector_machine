The 43-year-old priest and 26-year-old nun were caught "in the act" in a tinted saloon car parked at Lilongwe International Airport.  "It was a bizarre spectacle, the public alerted airport police when they noticed the car shaking in a funny way," police spokesman Kelvin Maigwa told the BBC.   The nun said she had a lapse in judgement, but the priest, being a man of god as it seemed to be, blamed it on Satan tempting him.    Wh..th..hmmp...ok, now that's just weird.  Heh, that had to be a sight to behold.  The black and white musta been flyin.   Make's you wonder, what did the priest tell his wife when he got home.  Hell, he already commited adultery, why not do it with a nun, icing on the cake.
