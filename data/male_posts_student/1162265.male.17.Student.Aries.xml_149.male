Something I want because it'll make me happy, and something I fear won't.  Something. Normally, I would have written today, given an explict entry in my story of pent-up anger in a person manifesting itself in the worst ways... but you know what?  I couldn't write.  When I was pissed to be doing hard labor, ideas, so many ideas swarmed through my head, and I knew this, but just as quickly they were all forgotten.  In an instant.  In a heart beat, poof, bi-allah al-ra'is al-na'im is gone!
