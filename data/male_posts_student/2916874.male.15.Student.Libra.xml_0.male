I wanted to go to a over nighter at South Baptist church with tons of my friends. There is going to be games, movies, video games. I also wanted to go, to see my old friends from Grand Ledge/ Tons of my old friends are going to be there. But I cant go because my dad won't let me because he doesn't want to drive. It really sucks!! Now I am stuck here at home bored, when the whole Grand Ledge High School is at the church party having a blast. Ah well....  Besides this my day went fine
