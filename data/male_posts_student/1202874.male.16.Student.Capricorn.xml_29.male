(o)(o)... on another subject, i've recently seen a lotta people that have been m.i.a.  such as kristen from snowboarding, who i am very happy to say i'm gonna be hanging out with a few times before bhs. also brian yuhas has been a recent fixture too. he's a pretty funny kid and i'll be seeing a lotta him with golf team... last night was supposeably the season premeire (sp?) of the greatest show ever, american dreams. well it was just a repeat of last year's first episode. a certain malaysian was pissed to say the least. but then liz called and we both were pissed so it was all good. we talked for a long time actually now that i think about it. well this entry has been pretty uninformative to say the least so i'll cut my losses.
