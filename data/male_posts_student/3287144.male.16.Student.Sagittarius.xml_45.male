So why on earth can't people realise this when it comes to sitting down?  Today I had my geography exam [the irony here is amazing] in which I found someone where I was meant to be sat, after a brief silent argument [mostly hand gestures] they refused to move so I was forced in to sitting else where. So in geography exam they couldn't navigate to their seat. What is the world coming to? Short of putting up neon signs pointing out which seat is yours, there isn't much else people can do other than say which seat is yours and make sure you know it. If youâ€™re on a train, you can SEE the reserved ticket things on the seat. Why, oh why can't people SEE them?  That said geography didn't go too badly. Well Thursday is when my next exam so tonight has been my little 'break' as it were - basically wasting time listening to Talking Heads while complaining to friends about the heat - which is unbearable. REALLY awful. Just think, global warming will give us another ice age, or alternatively we could have a more Mediterranean style climate. Frankly things are hot enough as they are - and too cold in winter so lets not contribute to global warming folks.
