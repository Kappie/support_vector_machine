On Saturday, I helped out as I do every Saturday with kids church, I am working with the 5 year olds right up to the 10 year olds and for safe guarding laws I can't and shall never go into much detail about what goes on. But to say that saturday for kids is like a kids service, we have worship, and games and a drama and a message. With kids you have to know that there attenion span is very short so you have to be quick and to the point. After kids church I watched the rugby with some of the guys from church, they had a big screen set up at the church.  Sunday was also cool, we had Impact 68 which see's our young people come out of the service and chill out and play pool and table tennis and x box, Ben our pastor gave a youth talk which was awesome. Phil Baker spoke in the service (I served at one and attended the other) about finding Nemo and lessons we learn from the film it was amazing, because he likened movies to parables, which is true. In the evening  church was cool but I was really tired, I went home and set up for the party, we had a party for two college students who are moving out to the hills campus which was sad but happy too.  Yestoday (Monday) was cool I just chiilled, then went into town (CBD) I got a couple of books on Churchill, I love his leadership style and as I'm training to be a leader I wanted to look at different leadership styles, on I really love was called: 'Hitler, Churchill, Leadership lessons' it's fascinating because it goes on the bbc series about the two leaders, it does not comment on whether or not these were good or bad men (for we all know the answer to that). But simply looks at their leadership styles.What books are you reading right now? I would love to know. I went on to my homework supervision class, with my good friends Tony and Nas, they are like second parents and close friends whose kids I help with homework, this was fun. I enjoyed helping the kids and enjoy seeing them discover the revelation of how to answer a simple maths question or how to write a letter (which can be quite trying for a 6 year old) any way I hope I haven't been too long winded but I hope you guys continue to pray for me a God (and others trains me in leadership ready to serve His almighty purpose) much love and blessings Nat
