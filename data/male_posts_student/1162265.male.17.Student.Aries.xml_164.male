The two dreams, are of a rather personal nature, and one of them I've already forgotten.  Then comes yet another thing, which is gossip about certain people, and my observations about them, that'd I'd rather not say at the risk of alienating many of them, if you really want to know ask me in person or online.  Then I've got African Studies, not realizing Juniors usually don't take that class, I'm the only Junior.  Not all that bad all things considered, since I can't be the loudest person in the class since everyone, except for one guy, is black.  For once since my homerooms I'm in a class with mostly black people, how amazing, I can't express how dissappointed this is how the leveling works.  Mr. Gaines is pretty enlightend about it, he believes in letting us place ourselves.  That's the good stuff right there.  But after school I was pissed, depressed, sad, all at the same time.  I still don't know why I accepted a baby sitting job feeling like crap, but at least I got my Pre calc done.  Okay okay.  So that was pretty cool, except the anger and the stress which I couldn't focus on anything.  It was just general stres, and anger, and numerous other bottled up negative emotions I usually push to the side.  To make things better Mrs. S didn't get home until late so I had to deal with little home boy there playing Grand Turismo III for 5+ horas.  Then I get home, and get pissed at my dad for latching the door, because he's to dumb to realize I wasn't home (or at dinner for that matter).  So I kind of blacked on him a bit, then I came downstairs, and I read the Boondocks which made no sense, and somehow felt better knowing I'm a complete and total loser.  Maybe it's because I hate where I am, and realize it's to late to change it.... I really don't know, but I have a feeling I'm gonna need to make things change before I go crazy.
