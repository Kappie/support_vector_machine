I had a very nice holiday, got some very nice things, including a digital camera and a the twentieth anniversary edition of Trivial Persuit. Other than that my life has been very dull. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Tomorrow I'm going into Chicago to do some holiday things, and I don't even want to think about my presentation due next Tuesday.
