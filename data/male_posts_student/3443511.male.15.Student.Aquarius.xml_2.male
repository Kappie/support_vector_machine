I talked to my step-dad last night and he said that he would pick up the Slipknot c.d. on Wednesday.  IT CAME OUT TODAY!!!!  I was pissed because i spent hours working with him to get that c.d. the day it came out.  Now this ass says he can't get it.  I was ticked.  Anyways, now i have to wait till tomorrow night to get it...     Ahhh, yeah, we had locker "check" and cleanup today.  They just looked to see if there was any stickers or piles of crap in the locker.  They didn't even check.  Those lucky people who brought their stash...lol...     I was in my computer class, and i decided to send a couple more messages to the people of my school...  >.> It was quiet fun, i sent a message to that same girl saying it was someone else who sent her the message, and i auto-blocked the person for her.  I not only impressed her with my "computer skills"  but she also thought it was someone pulling a prank on her (about the girl i like).  I was "in the clear."  I couldn't have been happier...lol..  She looked at me differently though...it was kind of funny..     Yeah, this wasn't a very exciting day...I guess i got more admirers than i thought, another girl asked me out, so far, i know that 5 girls like me...and i don't like a single one... Not because i'm shallow or anything, but these girls are either really bitchy or just stuck up little....you know, the real "popular" people...lol...  I just came home and caught up on some more computer security articles.  I'm currently learning JavaScript, Visual Basics, and PHP.  Seeing as i am pretty good at HTML..  I actually made a couple pages on Notepad that goes directyl to a website (.html) for an assignment in my History class.  She was surprised with just basic commands...lol, it's fun to be admired...      ~only when you've lost everything are you free to do anything~
