Following EB Matt and I went to the theatre to run some Time Crisis 3... I swear the guns musta been bust cuz Im sure I was shooting them in the head and they wouldnt die. When we died we got our tix and sat down to wait for Spiderman 2. That movie was tooooo good!!! If u havent seen it, then stop reading this and go out now!!! Unless its like midnite then I guess u can wait. But I definetly recommend it. I dunno why but I almost cried... lol... and its an action movie!!! Just go see it...  After the movie Matt and I decided to get some food. I kept on telling him to pick a place and he kept on telling me to pick a place. After 25 mins of back and forth arguing we finally decided to introduce an arbitraitor... Mrs. Simpson, who was still at town centre. She told us to go to Taco Bell... good choice. When she left, we sat around and then decided to just get some McDonalds. lol, today was Big Xtra day, mmm...  After the food, Matt got introduced to the shopaholic in me. I dragged him from store to store looking at everything and judging how I would look in it. I could see the boredom in Matt's eyes as he told me that he was fine wit it. I found some nice 3x golf tees... I almost bought it but stopped myself at the last second. I also almost bought some plain black 4x tees but stopped myself there too. August 20, ima have a thuggin outfit ready for some1 ;). Well after SportCheck, Champs, Foot Locker and Athletes World, we finally returned to the food court to get a fruit juice/smoothees. That was good too ^.^. After sitting down and savouring it, I decided that I wanted to see if WC3 was at EB. I found it, and couldnt resist temptation as I coughed up $60 for the game. Finally after giving him my FF7  8 and strat guides, we parted ways at the RT station. I took the 129 McCowan north to McCowan and Sheppard then the 85 home as Matt went to get the RT.  When I got home I changed and installed WC3 and the expansion. The graphics are CRISP!!! And the gameplay is tooo good. I dunno bout online play but the single player is nice. More of you should get it so we can run some intense games!!! I think this might replace sc :0  Well g2g, damn rentz  See y'all later  Warren  [17]
