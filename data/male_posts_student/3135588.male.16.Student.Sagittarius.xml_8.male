Hits would be nice, but I'm just going to use this for what it is really... an online diarymabob. Sounds a bit crap really, ah well.  Yeh It's been a while since I posted, I've been on annual camp with cadets, that was awesome. If you're not a cadet, and you're old enough but not too old, I really suggest joining the Air Training Corps. If only for the camps. Immense. At first glance, they look really boring, the programme includes lots of drill + plenty of ironing and polishing/bulling of shoes, but it really doesnt matter. The good things outweigh the bad ones by miles, the only thing being, you dont realise this until you've actually done it so when you're thinking about it, you say to yourself "yeah, that looks fun" (insert own sarcasm) but it is! I really need to find more adjectives. (really. What a lame word) But ya, camp was amazing, met some really good people like bennet, mandy/shandy/adam,  megan , etc etc... all of whom are great. Oh I almost forgot, one person everyone should know is the one and only AVANN. Ah the times we had poking fun at his name... "packinavan, bininavan, oldmaninavan..." Bliss. Anyway, that was my weeks worth of 5 hours sleep a night. (If I was lucky) Then on sunday, I had to get up  again  to go flying! Cuh! I only got in two flights and I didnt like my captain so not really the most productive of days...  *shoots self for saying "really" again*  And so here I am. At work. Who decided upon a 37 hour working week?? Madness! My fourth day and im absolutely knakred! Ah well, It'll keep me fit all this typing and walking to the coffee machine...  Until next time folks...
