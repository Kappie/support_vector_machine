CONGRATS REZA         Sorry about that reza, sorta shouted you out, you can make fun of me later...      It is sad to say that three avid [SMUT] members (bob, kev, and jay) have left to their colleges, a sad day indeed. But my friends, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. With their absence, i say we take heed, start drinking and smoking on our OWN accord, as in we go out to find parties, so when the preceeding three return, we can say that yes, we know where theres a party, yes you guys can come, no bob, you dont need to have people over. We owe this to them.     Along with making life easier for them we must come to a realization: THIS IS OUR FUCKING SENIOR YEAR. We must go out and visit bob and kev, we must convince our parents that this is our last year here, that we are almost (if not already) 18 years old and we can stay out later than 11. We must drink and smoke to our hearts CONTENT. No regrets fellas, lets make this last year something we can remember forever (or, depending on what you do, DONT REMEMBER).    Think about what i wrote my [SMUT]TY ones, and think long...  farewell Stimpith J.
