Today was so interesting! haha... well... today was Amy's last day in school and man, it was really quite emotionally charged in a sense... though it wasn't like there was crying and stuff, but at least there was some sense of belonging, whereby Amy seems to be part of us already! haha... yup... anyway, i guess it's with her presence that also enabled the class to bond even better! haha... It was the very 1st day whereby the class sat together and shared pizza! haha... it was a farewell treat to Amy and i hope that she enjoyed it... haha... so many people were envious of us and the rest of the attachment people kept looking at Amy! haha... oh well... Anyway, i am happy to say that at least out of the 23 people present today, all 23 of us sat down at the same table and ate together! it was something that was only minimally short of a miracle! haha...    Anyway, with Amy going away, the class would definitely be much quieter and perhaps not as much laughs as there normally would be! haha... yup... oh well... With her leaving us, i hope that she takes back memories, unique only to those that have attended or participated ACS life with her! Anyway, i also would like to thank her for her simple and nice card! yup... THANKS AMY! ;p    haha... okok... today was certainly an extrodinary day! it was the day whereby i 1st donate blood! Alright! haha... it's damn cool lah! i was the very 1st person to donate blood or 1st student to donate blood and undergo the procedures however, i was the 3rd to finish lah! wah lau... it was really cool! But i guess, it was really scary as well cause the 1st time mah! haha... but anyway, i placed my faith in the Lord and he granted me the calmness that i needed, thus allowing everything to go smoothly, even when they had to search for my viens for a good 5 minutes! haha... but anyway, the whole procedure wasn't pain at all, the only slightest pain would be that of testing your blood type where the pain is like an Ant bite! haha... Audrey was sitting next to me, and well... Rachel was sitting next to her lah, throughout the whole procedure Rachel gave us comfort and just kept us company... something that was realy sweet of her... it is her whereby i understand why did i feel so strongly for her in the past... Anyway, i felt this great sense of satisfaction at the end of the whole thing and was really happy that at least i can make a difference!    Anyway, i have more or less settled whatever relationship problems that i may have. I do know that right now, i am somewhat still torn between... the 2 most important girls in my life lah... but... at least, i am more or less sure whom i have chosen... but... let's keep it a secret lah... perhaps in future, if things between me and her work out, i'll put it up... till then... let's just leave it as this... yup... ok... Keep Smiling! :p
