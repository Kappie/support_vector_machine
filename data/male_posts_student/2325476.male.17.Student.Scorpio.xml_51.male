It's already 7:31 and regardless of how out of it i feel, i make it to sunlight, so im up for the day. :) woohoo. Don't let me drive anywhere tho, not without a fuckload of caffeine first. :) lol.... that shouldn't be funny, heh.  Yea, this one right here goes out to all the baby's mama's.. mama's... mama's mama's... heh, baby's mama's mama's...yea, it golike this...  I hope we feel like this forever, forever, forever ever, forever ever?  Hah, it's gotta be weird reading this, discrening what's coming from my head, and whats just passing from my ears to my hands.  So you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  BWAHAHAHAHA  i'm tired...  ...bitches!
