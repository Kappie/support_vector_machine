NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LOVE ON THIS BLOG. too boring for the average people's intellects. now i'm going to rank their best songs according to depressing content..... 1 = highest          9 = lowest  1. Ang Huling El Bimbo 2. Pare Ko 3. Magasin 4  Torpedo 5. Julie Tearjerky 6. Harana 7. Toyang 8. Tindahan Ni Aling Nena   9. Alapaap       This is my opinion so i don't care if you think that Toyang is not depressing. why is it that i don't talk about love, well, there was this girl......
