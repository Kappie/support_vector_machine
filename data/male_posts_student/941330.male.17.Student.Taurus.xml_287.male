"hi, do you come here often?" she says cheerily.  "no, we only come to see the fireworks." damn, i want her to go away.  "well, i come here a lot, but i haven't the last two years because i'm a lazy bum. i hope the fireworks are good this year though. i've been to san francisco, those are some nice fireworks. it's usually windy though."  i stand there, give her a benign smile while making as little eye contact as humanly possible, and hope she stops talking. BUT SHE DOESN'T.  "have you seen the fireworks at san francisco? blah blah annoying windy blah blah yadda shut up don't you hate when i keep talking to you when i'm obviously aggravating the shit out of you and you don't want to listen to me waste oxygen by spouting my ignorant, self-serving remarks, but i have absolutely no sense of propriety and i keep on continuing aforementioned one-sided discussion because i'm an asshole who doesn't represent anybody from american high school that doesn't think the all-consuming purgatory that is my godawful cacophonous voice is worse than being castrated with a safety pin?"  "no, of course not. you know, people like you are my favorite in the whole wide world."
