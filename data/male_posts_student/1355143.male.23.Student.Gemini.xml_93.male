But the reason I mention this match is twofold. First, to warn Adam that we're coming for him, just like the Continental soldiers came for the redcoats. Second, one of the announcers yesterday made a terrible comment during the game. But a little background is necessary. Back in the 80s, the US invaded Grenada for some unknown reason (unknown to me, that is). The invasion was brief (Grenadiens number only 90,000) and I believe quite bloody. Probably an effort to put down some coup d'etat or other. But anyway, fast forward to 2004. The commentators during yesterday's match said "Grenada needs a 4-0 victory to win on aggregate, and they have about as much chance of that as they did in the invasion back in the 80s." I thought this was in poor taste, and I just wanted to comment on it. It reminded me of something George W. would say over coffee with his Yale mates. Kerry, 2004.  Tóg go bog é, Tadhg Ffrench (cupla focail gaeilge just to keep you guessing)
