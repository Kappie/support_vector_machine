(and its a noun for your information) anyways, i guess ill tell you why the hell im talking about belgian waffles...well not too long ago, the morning after kenny (STOCK) spent the night at my house before the day we went with montana to scandia. he guzzled down 5 thick, home-made belgian waffles...yes, 5! i wasnt sure if that was physically possible before it happened, but after it did...i was a believer! yes kenny, i believe now, all thanx to u. and any of you who dont believe, come to me and im sure we can arrange a private session with kenny where he can guzzle down 5 (if not more!) belgian waffles for u. that is all for now, until next time...im out! urlLink
