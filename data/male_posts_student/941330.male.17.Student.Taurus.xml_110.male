"go"/"everything you want" -- vertical horizon 3. "results may vary" -- limp bizkit 4. decent badminton racket 5. nike tracy mcgrady jersey 6. t-mac 3s (white and blue/gray) 7. ankle socks, clothes in general  ok, now on to substance. junior year so far is easily better than last year. uhh (don't you hate when i do that?), yesterday i wore my swimming trunks as board shorts cuz they're like 2 sizes too big so don't pants me pretty please with sugar on top. math test was easy (james: "when you say it's kinda easy, that means you got it all right"), stupid confucius reports in mandarin (go eugene WANG, he went first, that krazay boy), in art sally was like, "you can leave a space white right?" "yea it's a value, it adds balance...wait this is just cuz you're too lazy to color it in huh" "exactly!" after school said happy birthday to kevin, alex gave him a cool drawing of him (except his mouth has no teeth) with his striped shirt and two "hot" chicks next to him, tiffany was like "it looks like a cross between arnold schwarzenegger and a girl." kevin said that sophie gave him a present, what is it what is it, (i screwed this up, so alex dont bitch about it) does it have to do with sex, YES, is it a book about sex, yes you're close, is it playboy, no, is it porn, no, playboy is porn, really, penthouse, no, playgirl, eww no, blah blah, its a book about sex, i said that that was my second guess. tiffany jason kevin went home, i gave kevin a HUG OF DOOM AND PENULTIMATE INTROSPECTION (random words). me amanda adam went to the '05 skit writing, stuff about nascar racing cuz street racing is too corrupted for us impressionable HIGH FUCKING SCHOOLERS, they didn't use my genius idea for "uni-T-shirts" waah. went to jack, walked back, i biked home.   yabba dabba doo, then badminton, HELLA people came, hit around with ankur while pat made fun of both of us, rita came back from signing up with the navy hella crazy, company attention! about face! ready and...MARCH! yes i butchered it. gave liss my sweater to sleep on cuz she was tired from the senior picnic and going on a water ride 10 times =O, it was hella big on her and you couldnt see her shorts, haha ankur went off with that. hit around with her and rita, rita exhibited common symptoms of the alex syndrome ("i suck! i suck! man i suck!"). played more, james taught me serves and he was excessively nice i think, me and james lost to simran and alex on tiebreaker. stupid drills, pat's dad thinks we're SECOND GRADERS, no offense to pat you are cool, i'm getting today mixed up with yesterday, joann chang was there, she's going to do the 8-court design with her crazy architecture skillz. went outside, chi was violated by simran earlier, "i felt his thing!!" then his and liss's mom came like 30 minutes late, talked to alex etc, gave natasha my sweater, then everyone went home.  today, haircut which i thought was cool (styled) then ugly (washed) then cool (dry). badminton, don't wear muscle shirts around simran cuz he will TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU LIKE HE DID CHI. hit around with amita who was playing easy on me cuz she had karate earlier and felt sorry for my crappy abilities. singles is funner than doubles. did drills, ditched amita but she found me out and whacked me with a karate KICK OF BANANAS. then um, hit around with greg (need to learn: smashes, not hitting with the frame, picking birdie up with racket), i hit amita like 4 times (accident, i swear!) then greg hit liss like 4 times so she got angry, turned into the hulk, and twisted greg's head off. actually she just hit the birdie back but hey wasnt that more interesting? or maybe not. somewhere i played natasha and jun, natasha is pretty good, so i lost. me and alex played debbie and liss, liss hit each of us like 20 times. me and pat vs. liss and alex, we won straight sets wheee. alex and liss kept on talking trash, but i dug deep into my fountain of resources and let pat beat them. my serves were somewhat consistent, so i'm happy. then i played some girl and got bageled twice cuz i cant smash, then played with liss and she hit me about 10 more times, then everybody left, alex nearly ran me over in his aunt's car not really, and i got home.
