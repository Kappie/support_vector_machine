He got up 15 minutes after his alarm went off and then left the house about 9:20.  The appointment was at 10 and started about 10:20 as there was a pretty girl before Tyke that went a litle longer than expected.  She came out hiding her mouth for some reason, apparently not wanting to show the world her face.  But Tyke then got ready for his thingy.  The laughing gas was applied through the nose tube and it was just like expected.  At first it made Tyke feel light-headed and a little nauseous (last time he had real anesthetic he got really sick) but he never got any worse.  He started to sort of drift off a little bit but then they added more O2 to the gas and then Tyke really didn't feel the gas effects at all.  He was pretty relaxed but he was never nervous in the first place so it didn't really matter.  The actual operation was quite simple.  They took out all 4 and the worst part was when they took out the bottom two teeth as, although they were the easiest to take out, they were big so it hurt to pull them out of his mouth.  It really didn't feel that bad though.  And when Tyke was getting numbed it was weird too as he could feel the needle, or whatever it was, going into him.  But again it wasn't that bad.  After the surgery he felt his lower lip and mouth and it felt so cool cuz it was fat and numb so it felt like he was feeling someone else's skin and it felt really smooth and was great to caress.  At least until he realized he was feeling his mouth up.  At home he has been taking out the gauze and putting it back in a lot as he has been bleeding pretty consistently but now the pain really hasn't been there.  Some minor discomfort but he hasn't really had to take any Vicodin.  He has of course taken some but he hasn't really needed to.  But he can't chew for a few more days and he will still have to get the stitches out next week which might not be fun.  But for now Tyke feels fine other than the nausea that has started to come back.  But maybe it's just cuz he hasn't slept in a while.  So he should probably go do that now.  He can talk alright but he doesn't always want to answer his phone.  So you can still call it but if he doesn't answer, just leave a message.  He'll make the next move.
