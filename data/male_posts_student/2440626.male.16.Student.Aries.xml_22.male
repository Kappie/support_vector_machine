So far I have completed N. and S. America, Europe, Africa, and Australia.  I must admit though, the travel industry is rather interesting!  I would really like to learn more about it.  Anyway, 25000$ is certainly worth all this cramming!  Pringle midterm on wednesday. I think it will be a bit easier than what he is making it out to be.  Johann Hyonkerburgherhh test tomorrow! nlx configurations! orbitALs.  VOICE ImoDuLATION!!!  Oh my...gotta love it.  Well, I am gonna go...time to read up on ...JAPAN!!
