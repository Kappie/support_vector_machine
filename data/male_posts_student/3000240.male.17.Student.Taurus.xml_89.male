No; life would be something only depressed 14 year olds do (i.e. me a couple of years ago).  I really can't be bothered to clean out the flea ridden litter until the motivation returns - which suffice to say shouldn't be too quick in its glorious return.  Weekend is shaping up to be funky - I'm meeting this ultra-cool girl and we're going to SEGAWORLD woo!!!!! I always remember that place from when I was little and it was so awesome that I thought it due time for a revisit, and if all doesn't go to plan, then we'll be of to the pub. I really like this one, she's so unlike her age lol - if that makes any sense. On Saturday I'm going for a 8-3 shift at work and then traxlover has a big super-extreme happy/hippy party planned which she's asked me to grace with a tenner for the lovely drug bloke. He seems so sweet with the guns and death threats and all I bet he dishes out with regular consistency to all his "chums". Aha me and my warped soap box of complex opinionated bullshit. xBuBzx
