To distrust what is always said, what seems,  to ask old questions, interfere in dreams,  leave home, smell rats, have hunches do not endear cats to those doggy circles where well-smelt baskets, suitable wives, good lunches are the order of things, and where prevails much wagging of incrurious heads and tails.   Face it. Curiosity will not cause us to die- only lack of it will. Never want to see  the other side of the hill or that improbably country where living is an idyll (although a probably hell) would kill us all. Only the curious  have, if they live, a tale worth telling at all.   Dogs say cats love too much, are irresponsible, are changeable, marry too many wives, desert their children, chill all dinner tables with tales of their nine lives. Well, they are lucky. Let them be nin-lived and contradictory, curious enough to chance, prepared to pay the cat price,  which is to die  and die again and again ,  each time with no less pain. A cat minority of one is all that can be counted on to tell the truth. And what cats have to tell on each return from hell is this:  that dying is what the living do, that dying is what the loving do, and that deads dogs are those who do not know that dying is what, to live, each has to do.      we read this in english class .. and for some odd reason .. it just took me and i loved it!! ENJOY!!
