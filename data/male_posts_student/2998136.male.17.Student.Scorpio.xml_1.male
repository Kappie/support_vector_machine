Firstly, I want to apologise to my blog for not feeding it for days and also to the readers out there who needs my inspiration from my nonsense.  Today it's a very surprising day for me in school, when I was walking to class, I turned my back and suddenly saw a ghost floating and had been following me behind me. Oh no, it was reading a pornography comic and it was my classmate who is trying to scare me by keeping silence in a broad-daylight out of everyone. Alright, I am not afraid of it. Then when we got into the lift, we were having kind of romantic atmosphere feeling for a while until we got out because there was only one light bulb working. I know this school wants to save electricity. Ok, I understand.  After school, I went to the library to do my proposal which is as long as my blog. The library plays very soothing and relaxing music over there which makes you very horny and the scenario is usually a sexy lady trying to seduce a man. You know I was trying hard to restrain myself from masturbating publicly in front of the surrounded cameras, but I think it's not worth it because the librarian could make a fortune selling porn video of me. I thought library should be a very decent place, nevermind I think it's trying to attract more people to the library. Not only they provide entertainment to the ear, also to your eyes. They even go to the extend of installing 3 TVs on the first floor, that's very inconsiderate of them. How can they expect us to have 3 eyes like the "Er Lang Shen" (a 3-eyed deity) to watch 3 screens at a time? And we also do not have 3 ears to listen 3 things at a time.  What's more? When I was doing my work half-way through, there was a guy's voice over the PA system saying that he's going to sing us a song. Oh my god, when did library becomes a KTV? So I waited a while, techno music started to blast out the whole library and I thought was I there to enjoy clubbing. Now the library became a disco in just a few seconds, so next time they are gonna install lighting effect and serve alcoholic beverage there.  That's all for my Monday today!
