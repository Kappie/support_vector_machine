One of the girls, Laura B, I think, hinted that I had told her something about me to katie. Katie got in a stress about it cause I don't tell her anything at all. So, I saw her outside the A block area after break and said hello, as you do, and then Victoria, said can I speak to you lloyd, and sort of led him away. Katie said she was really pissed off, cause I don't share stuff with her. We walked down to the C block, where we stopped to talk. She asked if I was gay, I said yeah. I sort of imagined that she would run off crying but she didn't, she asked a few questions like how long have you been gay, to which I replied all my life. She was so pissed off with me, she had every right to be. I hugged her twice, and on the second time she went to kiss me and I turned my face so she got my cheak. The bell went and she went off in one direction, and I in the other. I went for a short walk just to clear my head, and then went up to science, where lloyd, the lauras, gemma and heather were all waiting. I think gemma said are you alright. I nodded. I felt so so bad. Lloyd kinda ignored me, I don't think he ment to but I felt like that. I walked over to where I leave my bag and started unpacking. When I turned around I saw them all going down the stairs to the other science room. They though we were in the other room today, but then Mr Doyle came along to our class and I walked in, there was so much in my head I forgot to talk my bag off. Anyway, I sat down with no one else around me cause they had all gone to the other class room. I almost started crying, I was so close. Then in came gemma and heather, later followed by lloyd and the lauras. They asked if I was alright, and I said no. They sorta asked what happened and stuff and I told them but I was trying not to say anything in front of lloyd, cause I didn't know how much he actually knew. We then went to english, and I walked with Laura B. I was nice, I felt as though, she kinda forgave me for what I done to her friend. Anyway she asked what I said, what katie said and all that kind of stuff. After English, me and lloyd were walking down the stairs and he said, Jonathon, I think I should clear the air. I know. I asked how much he knew and he said everything. I felt good to finally be honest with him. I said I'm glad we got that out the way. Surprisingly he was really nice about it. I didn't expect that at all. I though he would absolutly hate me but he didn't, he treated me no differently to how he normaly does. I went into youth club and sat down next to arron, he asked if we'd split up, I said yes. Everyone was kinda asking questions which I was fine about. Lloyd came over towars the end, and I actually didn't mind, perhaps insted of trying to move on from lloyd, I should be taking him forward with me. He asked me a few things, and for the first time in a long time I felt I could tell him anything. I can't believe how much difference coming out has made in my life. I'm glad it's this way. Quite a few people now know, 12 I think, and it does feel good. Victoria's just texted me to say she knows and thinks Katie will come around, which is good news I guess. It's all definatly for the best and I think today, will also be one of those days I'll never forget.
