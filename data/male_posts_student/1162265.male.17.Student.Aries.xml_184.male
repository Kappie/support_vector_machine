I guess it's because my XBOX is fucked up, and I can't just play "True Crime" for hours on end. I've considered just watching TV, I can't.  I tried playing on the Computer, no fun.  It's just like everything's dried up for me.  Like I have this huge void I need to fill.    Then I also have to hold in stuff.  Wrap it up and hold it in.    At least on the bright side, I saw J Reilly!!! OOOOH shit.  Allie, I have seen the Lord God.  Tim was with him too.  To make things even better I saw little Coltrane, he's the greatest and on the same job related note I saw Jen.  Oh lord.  She was smoking some really weird cigarette.  I never would have guessed she smoked.  But we talked for a hot second, then she drove off in her expensive as hell car.
