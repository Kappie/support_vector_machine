If it's on the 8th it will probably have to be in the evening, whereas on the 9th it can probably be in the afternoon.  Here is a fanfic rec for you all-- The Not Quite Love Letters, a SW fic on fanfiction.net. It's about Han and Leia and their relationship after the Battle of Yavin revealed through a few angsty journal entries, but mostly through official Alliance communications and random things like that. In the first chapter Han invites Leia to polish his medal. In the second chapter, computer terminals get thrown onto people's heads. It's really funny.   Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
