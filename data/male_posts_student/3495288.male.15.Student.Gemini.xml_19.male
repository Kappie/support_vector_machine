If i knew i should have gone to the concert all alone. I went to the concert to relax, learn some stuffs from those two tubist and enjoy the music. It seems like not worth the money for them. It was kinda worth it for me. Haiz... Then want to say the Tuba solo is boring. No its not boring if you don't truly understand MUSIC. People who have no background of music, like me, can understand because i have learn music. People with very little knowledge of music enjoyed the concert as well. Why can't they. Waste my money only. Now i am grounded from going out to concerts that are expensive. My mom grounded me cause she asked me where was the money... i just kept quiet about it. Haiz... Why does bad things happen to me. Haiz. If i were them... i would just say that the concert was nice but some parts were boring or say that the tuba solo was ok. Haiz... at least Respect lah the instrument that i have been in love with for 3years. Its not easy starting off with the LARGE C flat Tuba. Haiz... next time i go alone lah. Haiz... so dissappointed you know. If this were to happen again right... i think i just go alone lah. Their attitude were like went, "The concert so boring, Cannot spell concert properly, Tuba solo is boring.".. Than Ash.. wanna make fun about my instrument. I represent ALL TUBA MEMBERS, no matter male or female, young or old, fat or thin, straight or gay... I dont like people to make fun of my instrument. Its my passion. It was the one that made me have inspiration. Haiz... Next thing i learned is that I should get Daniel's contact so that i can contact him if i have any questions about the next outing or concert or whatever lah. I don't even know if he is going to the concert today, at the botanical garden. Haiz... I think he wont be coming lor... like he never contact me. Like this i go alone lah. Here i am again... being a  LONER.
