I went to the  mall today, for buyign the new Avril's cd, but the proce grew, eight reais. So i wasted my time.  Gee man! I watched a movie today, "The ring", wow, i jumped out from the couch, it's so scary, i love it! Isn't it wierd?!!!! An hour ago i did "brigadeiro", i don't know the trasnlation, anyway, it's sooooooo good! Oooooh God, i gotta quit it out.  P.S: thanks John for keeping readin' my blogger.
