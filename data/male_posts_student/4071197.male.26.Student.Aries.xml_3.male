O’Brien (2004) explains that by using CRM information systems, companies try to increase customer value over time and to gain a competitive advantage over competitors. CRM initiatives aim at creating a cross-functional framework within an organization, an enterprise system that combines and computerizes many of the processes that involve the customer, including sales, marketing, customer service and support, retention and loyalty programs, and contact and account management. Furthermore, the CRM system integrates these customer service processes with the remainder of the company’s business functions.  Reference O’Brien, J. A. (2004).
