In one of them I was getting married!  Totally weird, I never got to see who I was marrying but the person's family was kinda crazy (I think the mum was Italian or somethin :S)  I am crazy really, I have never had a dream like that before.  I started panicking because I was about to get married then I remembered that we were moving to America so I couldn't get married, so I was trying to talk to my mum but she couldn't hear me for some reason.  It was about then the dream changed...  The next dream involved some kind of school competition, which had most of the people at school in.  Loads of people from school were round these colourful rainbow-like victorian cottages doing stuff, finding crystals I think (this is how perculiar dreams can get!).  It was probably a memory of the rocky cycle we were doing in chemistry because she talked about crystals in there.    Next, I can remember being on a bike with Sam, and Leander and Jo were there (they weren't on bikes) and we bumped into this trendie group or somethin but they didn't do anything.  We hopped over a few walls then the dream genre changed again.  We were by a river and oliver was there too.  My bike was stuck in the river and I was worried what Grandma and Grandad were gonna say (presumingly they bought it me).  We had to get across this really easy-breaking bridge and it kept on sinking in the water of this rapidly flowing river.  It was like made of cardboard sheets.  I kinda made it to the end when we were suddenly sitting in a hall with 'results' papers and aparantly I wasn't meant to be in the 'river crossing' challenge... ok....!  I have some weird dreams!  I then appeared in this factory/medical environment and I was some kind of officer wearing this stylish blue uniform with orange stripes around the sleves and a cool security ID card clipped to my chest.  There was a rogue loose on the area and everyone was on alert to look for him.  It turns out this was a child and he had a syringe full of some dangerous chemical.  The child (he might have been in the form of Ryan in my dream I'm not sure) injected it into this woman and ran off and I was the only one who witnessed it (she was quite pretty actually, but it was no-one i've never seen before).  I got her help then the kid re-appeared with the syringe loaded again.  He started chasing me and I ran and ran (this is what backs up my thing about Ryan.  Yesterday he was chasing me into my room and trying to get in.  The dream could have been moulded around that memory with added fear from me, because I'm terrified of needles).  The dream then changed into some kind of near-nightmare scenario.  I ran into this large underground mechanical type place which looked kind of like a tourist attraction underground view thing.  I ran being this wall and into this chamber style place.  I think I was still in the same place as before (the factory/medical environment) but I was just me, not the officer person.  We were trying to get into this chamber which had these two men in these strange blue uniforms with big equipment attatched to their shoulders (might have been something like off Red Alert 2 I think) and I was with this scary person who gave me these light guns.  We were shooting at the base of the protective screen around this chamber and it collapsed like a wall of cards.  We went in and then got trapped somehow.  We found a way out into this monk type place and he was talking about God and stuff and we were desperately asking for a way out.  He showed us finally.  The dream that followed that was just as strange.  Me, Mum, Daniel and Ryan were walking through a public area... in America!  (Although in my dream, something told me it was the USA).  We walked through the crowds and I saw two large black skyscraper type buildings, which were both kinda tilted (they were probably formed in my dream by my memory of the photos I took in America as I was going past things in the car, they came out slanted on the actual photo later) and then I saw two more funny shaped buildings.  We walked out of the buildings and onto this country like area.  Sam, Craig and a few others were biking up and down this field and I kept thinking that all my mates could visit me every weekend in America because in my dream America seemed to be not far south from Cornwall lol.  In that scene, Mum and the rest of the family mentioned previously had dissapeared and it was just my friends.  We walked through these pathways to this house (which looked kinda like craigs, but it wasn't on the same side of the road) and Sam and everyone was there and it was the sleepover.  Everyone went inside and I stayed outside, that's when Mum appeared again.  I can't remember what was said but it might have been funny dream talk.  This post has been amazingly large, I hope you read it all lol.  I'm going to look up what these dreams mean so cya...
