Woke up at like 9am..lepak all morning and finshied some homework...and noticed that Ali cafe drink..that 5 in 1! coffee drink that well has coffee (:P),ginseng,tongkat ali,sugar and creamer is quite nice!Maybe can save money on Strabucks now :P :P :P  So went to some Aneka Daya place in Ulu Klang looking for tiles and bathroom stuff for my new crib..lotsa nice stuff...even some instant water heater with a digital lcd screen which tells time and more crap to!rm1700!crazy...and damn..jaccuzi`s are like rm16000..who could afford that?Hmm likely everyone in school except me :(  ...So hopefully I get to choose the crap in my room and my bathroom...instead of me and my brother sharing one considerably bigger bathroom,we are gonna get our own small ones instead which is fine with me!So I guess that means the total number of bathrooms in the house will be 4 or 5...thats alot for the ammount of space in my house :p ..Although they wont be so big..and i`m taking the bigger room instead..let my brother have the small one..heck hes only around for a few days every few weeks or months!  Then went around Jalan Ipoh looking for tiles shops..all closed man..but its a Sunday so no surprises..hahahaha saw 'The Stone Shop'.Lol.Afandi owns it i`ll bet ..lmao0..  then went home cause it was rainin and crap but stopped by TMC 1st and bought almost rm150 worth of groceries...yay!have banana mania ice cream!:D :D  Finshed up more omework..bet rm20 with Afandi who I heard was betting big man..Finals of course though..  Didnt attend Najats party..had other things on...in fact only Afandi,Adrian and Zaffique came from Cempaka..and Zaffique came on his own..not surprising..since hes form 3 and stuff...  well thats all for that day and stuff...cau-cau..
