A while ago, anonymous asked when and why I got involved in activism. I always enjoy sharing this story with others cuz it is a testament to how even dorky people can involved in something so amazing such as the struggle to free yourself, and humanity from the chains of capitalism, racism, and patriarchy.   Iwas involved in social welfare work since I was in high school via Special Olympics, reading to little kids, and soup kitchens. It was 911 that changed turned me to revolutionary politics. I saw what happened, and naively expected the Bush administration not to go to war with Afghanistan.When they went to war, I was finally able to connect all the other instances in my life when politics did not make sense and understand the importance of systemic political change. I ran into radical papers on the Internet that covered the uprisings in Argentina which quickly turned me to an anti-capitalist. I will never forget the faces of people when I told them I am against the war on Afghanistan. I used to flyer dorms at Michigan State Univ. and Univ. of Michigan. People looked at my like I was crazy. Luckily though, I also met people who agreed with what I said. I remember those days with joy and laughter as I tried to change the world with such naivety and youthâ€¦.I suppose the rest is history.
