I told the dude that i was playing that i wasn't that good... and i had just started the day b-4... and so he tought me all the tricks.. not 2 mention what sean tought me b-4... lol, and so then i actually ended up winning 2 outa three against him! and so i won that "round" but lost all the other rounds... but it's all good! and i just found out a lil whie ago that the band that i joined a few days ago is gana b practicing tomorrow (for the first time that i've ever practiced with them..) it should b pretty interesting... but yeah... when i got 2 the cardshop today... it was like full of like card nerds... like the type u see on tv... squar glasses. really skinny, too much money then they know what 2 do with... so they buy cards... and they like drool over n e card that u have that they dont! lol... but yeah... the turny actually wasn't that bad! they were actually surprizingly enough really friendly! But yeah, i think i will go back next week to the bat cave card shop for another wizard card turny... if you win 3 rounds and loose one, you get $10.00 instore credit... if you win all four games, then you get $20.00 instore credit... but if you only win 2 rounds... you get a pat on the back and "good job" and if you just win one game you get a "HOW COULD YOU LOOSE SO BAD? " j/k... lol, and of course, if you win no games... your banned from coming back! LoL j/k. but yeah... The flowers that i sent whitney 2days ago... she got them today... lol, her mom now wants her 2 marry me, her mom also wants 2 meet me... lol, oh boy...meet the parents! LOL, and FYI for all... no, whitney is not my gf, and no we're not going out! (just 2 clear that up) lol well yeah... that was basically my day... sean and i hung... went 2 the card shop... :-D
