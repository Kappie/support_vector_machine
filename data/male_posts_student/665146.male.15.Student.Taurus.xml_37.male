It was a benefit for a place known as 826 Valencia, a pirate store with a writing class.  The whole thing is run by Dave Eggers, a well known writer who I've never heard of, but he'd make one hell of a pirate.  My dad and I found it during a stroll through the Mission, and when we looked inside, well, now I just sound like a 5 year old...  I'm going to write like a five year-old:  We sawed the place an it wuz nice. it made mee fell like a pirat on ship who had a parot. i never saw that many rops but the fish wer scary an the pepl wer to.  That's enough...  Anyway, the benefit was the event of the season, and from the very minute I walked in, I knew I didnt belong there.  May'be 100 well dressed people all with some creative knowledge of the art world and the social life within it gave me one awkward glance that pushed the hair down over my face for the rest of the night.  There was food, but not enough to go around for my family, so I skipped it.  For the next segment of my night, I was walking aimlessly around this social experiment of too many people with Buffalo Wing breath, in a small place, with bright lights on during a heat wave.  Chicken was coming out of everyone's pores and I was looking for a safe place to breathe.  Eventually, more lights went on for the presentation and we were all forced to stand in place for a story by an 11 year old (which wasnt as bad as I'm about to bitch about it) that brought a laugh to those with the worst breath, an article about monkeys by a 13 year old, and a bunch of really good poetry by some other teenagers.  During it all, I grew tired of being level with the stench and my legs hurt, so I decided to crouch.  During my time on the ground, I discovered that someone had dropped a LOT of pills.  Here's my thought on that:  Someone was bored, and saw their ex-girlfriend.  In an effort to get her back, if only for a night, he tried to sneak a ruffie into her drink.  The presentation was about to begin, so everyone turned to look at the stage, and he dropped all the pills.  I think someone had some, because a few were gone a bit later.  All in all, I'm not sure why I was there, but it was the most exclusive party I ever didnt pay attention to.
