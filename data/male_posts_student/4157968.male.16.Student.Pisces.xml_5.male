Pardon me for being a bit naive on the subject, but, what the hell? I might be a bit judeo-christian on this one, but shouldn't people who are maried atleast be attracted to the sex of their partner? I've heard of loveless mariages, but this statistic takes the cake. I cannot fathom how someone can be maried to someone of the opposite (or even the same) sex, unless they are attracted to that sex. Talk about defending mariage... I think it's time we called in Ricky boy on this one...
