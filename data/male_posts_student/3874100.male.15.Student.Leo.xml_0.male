What have I done:  ...uh...I won a giant fish at one of those games in the arcade, we were only there because the pool was shut though, but the fish kinda rocks...  ..wow!Haven't I been busy!?  Oh yeah, CAMP TOMOROW! Well, technically the day after because we leave early in the morning, but we have to get to the place at 8pm tomorow, (if I'm awake...) so yeah, it starts tomorow I guess. I'm pretty damn excited, especially since it's in Spain.   I will miss you all dearly,  I won't post for two weeks, but will tell all when I return, Yours sincerely, Jonny
