I'm now 5'6", having grown 1.5" from last time, and am 118 lbs, up 5 lbs.  Pretty good.  I had a bunch of teriyaki afterwards because I am really not concerned about my health at all, especially after the check-up.  I got my report card today: an A in chemistry, two A-s in history and math, respectively, two B+s in English and French, respectively, and a C+ in myth, folk tale, and science fiction.  I think that last one was because I didn't take a reading quiz on a packet I never got because I had to go to trials, but it's not worth fighting over since you can't change grades retroactively.  Whatever, not the end of the world; colleges will probably see it as me focusing on the important subjects anyway, the ones that interest me.  I hate it how teachers always say I have unexcused absences, even though I've never cut a class.  I've always had notes; they probably just lose them.  Oh well.  I also got a B on my Loren story, even though everyone who read it thought it was good and funny.  In study hall, I showed it to Jessica Li; she said parts didn't make sense, and I used too many big words.  Like "digits."  Vacation!  I drew up a plan in study hall by which by the end of the vacation, I'll have ALL of my work done, including the big research paper and the year-long suckfest.  Let's see whether I'll stick to it.  Tomorrow, I'm going to get crossed again, then I'll see "Kill Bill: Volume 2" with Daniel Waldinger and Arnaud, then I'll watch "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" at Matt K-K's house.  Let me see if there are any quotes I can end with...  "For him, it meant whatever he meant it to mean." ---Ms. Heidlage
