Anyway.  One Tree Hill update:  Is Lucas gonna die?  Will Peyton ever tell Brooke about what really happened?  There is a new ALIAS ep this Sunday.....YAY!!!!!  I so pumped.  I am really looking forward to this weekend.  The only thing that really blows is that we have school on Monday because of all those darn snowdays.  As long as we don't have school on Easter Monday (a.k.a. my birthday), I will be okay.  I think I will go eat a cookie, but not too many.  We are hitting up Frabrizi's tonight for spaghetti.  So good!!
