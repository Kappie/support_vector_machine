At least it's gotten me out of driver's ed for a couple of weeks ; ) Heh, since I couldn't afford to miss more than one class I had to reschedule and come back in the second week of the next class. Well I haven't been up to much (seeing as I'm sick and all). Watched "Deep Impact" last night... it was umm interesting. I really prefer "Armageddon" personally. Yeah and I just got finished watching "Emma" with my mom... crazy woman, someone shoudda smacked her. Anywhoo, I figure I should go get some more rest so I'll be fit for game night friday! Well God bless you all, and have a happy new year! El triste, extrano, pequeno hombre. (The sad, strange, little man)
