When I was a child I longed to become an astronaut and to strap myself to stalk of burning oxygen and hydrogen to reach orbit and the moon. As I grew older, I came to realize that being an astronaut required math skills... and then it was all over. My career choices seemed to be limited to that of Cowboy, Software Engineer or Pornographer. Hay fever and fear of prosecution forced me into the computer business.  I've been reading the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report (yes, 248 pages) for the last two nights and I'm about 3/4 of the way through. The physical cause of the accident would seem to be incontrovertible: a piece of insulating foam on the external fuel tank near one of the support struts came loose and struck the left orbiter wing, causing a breach in the leading edge heat shielding.  But the report places part of the blame for the accident at the feet of NASA's "can do" culture and that sometimes "can do" was confused with "should do." Schedule, political and financial pressures all led to an environment in which past successes (sometimes just luck) were taken as proof that deviation from standards were "okay." For instance, the foam shedding issue had been observed on many occasions and, even though ZERO foam shedding was the standard, managers began to see it as acceptable.  In addition, the report features a chapter devoted to the history of NASA's manned space flight program and the process by which we ended up with the Shuttle as it is configured now. It is not a pretty story.  If you'd like to be a geek like me and read the entire report, you can find it  urlLink here .
