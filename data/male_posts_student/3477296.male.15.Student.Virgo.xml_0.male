Except cover his addiction, he is known to authorities as Fred. Follows a series of gradually spriralling events that start from himself investigating himself...  A deep and revealing novel about the nature of drug addiction and the environment associated with it. K. Dick once again like in "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" (the movie "Blade Runner" was based on) uses powerful imagery and descriptions of the future to convey various themes throughout the story. For example, in the ennvironment of a Scanner Darkly, society has been polarised by the use of drugs in that there are the addicts and the rest of "normal" society. It is interesting to note that although the addicts are seen as the exiled and disgraced part of society, they see themselves as ones who are closer to reality and view the "normals" with contemptuos dissent for their ignorance. In "Do androids dream of Electric sheep", the disabled of society that have been affected by nuclear fallout also behave in the same manner.  I personally found the book to be not as involving as "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" as it was a difficult book to read. Much of the themes used by K. Dick most probably surpassed my understanding, thus losing a valuable part of the novel. Also the increasingly complicated plotline produced from the personality duality of the main protagonist, Bob Arctor or Fred, was confusing and seemingly unmoving at times.  I believe that if I read this book at a later time and later age, a deeper understanding of the novel can be attained. The novel is not so much based on plot than its themes. Perhaps that is why I did not enjoy it as much as I could have...  Sorry. Getting a bit late for another report/reflection. Will write about "We can build You" in the next post.
