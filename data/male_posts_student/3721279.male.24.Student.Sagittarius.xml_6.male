I've fallen in love with the digital delight that is the Blog, and will now only be posting fun new things on here.   "But wait!" you say, "What about your amazingly witty subpolls, and all of that neat yet useless information about your interests?"  Have no fear, it is all included in the Blog, with the exception of some things like the countdowns, and the links to some of the most disturbing humor the internet has to offer. To be honest, the subprofile was sort of a hassle to update, and didn't always work right. But, the Blog is easy to use, and allows for me to write as much as I could possibly want...I hope. And hey, I've written like three times in two days, so that has to say something!   And for those of you who really enjoyed my poetry (I think that was like 3 people), I'm sorry that you'll no longer be able to read it on my profile. However, I may be inclined to post it on here now and again. I'm actually thinking of compiling the presumably "best" selections from my stash, and perhaps pursuing some form of real publishing. Who knows!  This is only the beginning.....
