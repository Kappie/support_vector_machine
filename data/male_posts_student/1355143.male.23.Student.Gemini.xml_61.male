The word stems from the Old French "fennestre," or window (in Modern French the "s" is replaced with an accent circonflex, but I can't type that on my computer).  The prefix "de-" stems from Latin. So, we are wholly free from blame on this one, buddy. Take your qualms elsewhere for we are unequivocally innocent.
