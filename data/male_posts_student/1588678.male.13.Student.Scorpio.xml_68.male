If you can imagine being in Hawaii, at the beach, watching a beautiful sunset, with a Pina Colada in your hand, and feel the ocean water hit your face, THAT’S what it’s like watching this TV! By the way, Sony should be the only company allowed to use the word “TV.” They’re the best!   Anyways, this TV is great. Right after we got it, we then got a High Def box. Boy, lemme tell ya, you ain’t gonna seen the A’s beet the Red Sox 15 to 2 like WE did with the HD! And the sound is so friggin’ booming! We don’t even have surround-sound and yet it sounds as if you’re there! Very, VERY, awesome!  Now, I’ve got a long list of movies to watch on this bad-S.O.B.! I’ll come up with a list later, but I’ll tell you now that I watch the last 10 minutes of Scarface on it! I know; AWESOME!!!  Well, my advise to you: “If you EVER plan on getting a new TV (preferably a 50 inch-wide screen), get a Sony. You’ll get your moneys-worth!”
