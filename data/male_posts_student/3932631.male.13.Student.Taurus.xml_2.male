Vrooooooom.... the bus came we got on and chatted very happily throughout the journey... when we alighted at the bus stop opposite the hong kah grc.... we again slowly walked to adina's house as the heat was unbearable that day.... we stopped by a mama shop and did some 'looking shopping' a few bought nothing but a very handsome and very thin(very sarcastic though...) bought ten eggs at price of $1.50 which is $0.15 per egg... he paid the money happily and rushed up to adina house to meet the dogs at her house... den wei zheng, very hungry at the moment, fisrt thing he did was to go into the kitchen and prepare the things he needed for cooking the eggs he had at hand... when wei zheng finished preparing the utensils he needed, Jolyn came about and asked wei zheng wether she could cook first... wei zheng, being very gentlemanly(again very sarcastic), allowed Jolyn to cook first... jolyn also wanted to fry eggs, so she took all of wad adina had left at her house which only amounts to 2.... i went out to play with the dogs... she started to add in the eggs which she had beaten... den she say the frying pan got too much oil... so she took the already beaten eggs by wei zheng which amounts to 3 into her fryin pan(i already told her beforehand that nobody should touch the eggs when she was starting to cook and she agreed...)... i came in when she called me in to cook... i found out that my chicken eggs are missing... den a VERY innocent looking Jolyn said that she had used up her eggs... i asked her why... den she said there was too much oil added to the frying pan which was prepared by me... den i told her,"eh, why dont u throw away some of the oil until it is left until the desired amount?" who is in the wrong?
