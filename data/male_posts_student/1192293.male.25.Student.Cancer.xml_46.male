Will Hutton of the Guardian UK makes the argument that the new fundamentalism in this country as well as others, is neither original, nor particularly new.  I've been saying these things for years.  Religion can be a great force in peoples lives, but not when it makes them think that they need to:  A: Evangelize everyone. B: Impose their rules, no matter how cracked, on the rest of the world. C: Ignore science and common sense because of some document written thousands of years ago and translated hundreds of times since. D: Ignore some basic tenets of their own faith and emphasize others in order to justify things like war, poverty, pollution, and preferential treatment of their own people over all others. E: Kill those that disagree with them.   Go read this sublimely intelligent article.  Great food for thought on this holiday.   urlLink Link
