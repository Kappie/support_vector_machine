My English Lit exams on the other hand were not so great the first two exams were ok but the texts in contexts were horrible the poetry one went alright but it wasen't a brilliant essay but my Dr Faustus went horibbly. It was the worst exam I have ever done and I only manged to write just over a page and that was al rubbish. Oh well.
Best of luck with all your remaing exams Ryck (and you Sam if you have any more).

Oh Yeah and we got this really cool over sized paddling pool for 30quid which you can swim in and if you sit in it the water comes up to your neck, its fantasic!

Good Luck and speak to you soon.
