I say this as easily as someone saying "I want to start breathing." But I think it would a great quality for anyone. Especially Japanese, knowing that would probably give anyone a jumpstart into the business world.   Well, in researching teaching resources I came upon the website So You Want To Learn Japanese ... (http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~thoureau/japanese.html) which is a very funny site. Even if you have no interest whatsoever in the Japanese language, check it out.   The thing is, in California there are even more Asian tourists than cyclists. Back in Arizona, we don't have much diversity. We have us and reptiles. I already know some Spanish and would not be that difficult to continue and become fluent in. But seriously, think of the possibilities that could be opened to you if you were multilingual other than avoiding being ripped off on paying for everything while traveling. I'm thinking learning an Asian language would most definitely get anyone a high and secure position for any job. Also, if you get hired for that quality, it'll be most likely that you'll be a translator or doing international business which means you'll be getting to travel internationally on your company's tab. Of course, none of this is exactly brand new stuff. But it's all pretty cool and in the end, I would finally be able to watch anime and know what's going on.
