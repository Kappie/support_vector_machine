Will not go for another youth organised event ever again.  Became a bit sad again. Inferiority complex again. Didn't connect as well as I'd hoped with the NJC touch rugger girls. It was like a proving ground for myself. Will try again at CAP. Leon Toh connected damn well though. They literally told him to pack 'emselves up in his suitcase and take them away to Italy with him. I envied him for that. Inferiority complex speaking.  Spoke with Jolyn and Desiree. They're sweethearts. I like 'em.  Good night. (Yes... a short entry...)
