As I lay there, prepared to get my full-hour swedish massage, the masseuse put her hands on my forehead and began praying to God on my behalf, asking Him to help me accept this "healing" I was about to receive in the "most blessed" way.  She made several other references to her faith throughout the session.  I tend to be accepting of everyone's spiritual proclivities but was offput by this flamboyance.  If you had a massage therapist, or doctor or lawyer, what would you do or say in this situation?
