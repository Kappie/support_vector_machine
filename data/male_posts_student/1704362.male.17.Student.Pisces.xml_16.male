Besides dealing with all of the minimum-wage counselors who hate their jobs, the adult leaders (the parents of other campers... usually their sons are rude, obnoxious, and hateful... and there's nothing you can do about it because, as i said, their parents are there). Mine was an insane  Vietnam war veteran we referred to as "Viet Don". Of course, if he knew that, i would probably already be a bloody corpse in the wilderness of pennsylvania. His son set fire to my tent on more than one occasion. Oh, but there's more. So much more. If you'd like to hear about the escapades of Pool Director Dan, the Pool Director who seems to like little kids a little  too  much, or the  Kid Who Tried To Smoke a Cheeto , i'd be glad to tell you. Right after i go through my post-traumatic stress therapy.  In conclusion, if you are ever offered the exciting opportunity to attend one of these wonderful camps... run. Run and don't look back.  End Transmission.
