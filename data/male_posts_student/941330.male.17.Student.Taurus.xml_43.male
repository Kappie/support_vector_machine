Just the atmosphere, the activities and spirit (having a real reason to root for your basketball/football team), not to mention having an excuse to buy sweaters and hats and class rings and stuff. And burn my $4300+ worth of savings for college. Which really isn't a lot when you think about it. That'll be gone in...poof...a month or so. I need a job. But I don't wanna wear a dorky fast food restaurant uniform. Maybe if they had something sharp and flashy, like...jerseys and stuff. Then I would take half of minimum wage. As long as I could keep the clothes though. College would make me actually do my work on time too. Which is nice.   I don't like the uncertainty of what colleges I may or may not be able to go to. I want to know what kind of stuff would guarantee me enrollment, not have to conjecture on how many sports or clubs I would need to join to make it in. I just want to be in and...relax? Not in college. But even with all-nighters...midterms...it'll be worth it. Freedom...independence, all those cliches of finally "growing up"...but it's still something I want. Hopefully some of you guys come wherever I go...would be a very nice perk. Help ease me in. Being alone in such a big place would be...uh...lonely.   Sorry...that was worthless...and I lost five minutes that I could've spent on homework...oh well.   P.S.: Amita's birthday party was really cool. Good food...cool inflatable jumping house playset thingy (I beat Erik wrestling! Don't deny it), basketball practice, my first games of Twister, learning to skateboard, getting kneed by Richard...seeing some hella funny movies on the Internet ("don't forget the blue hair")...gotta love it.
