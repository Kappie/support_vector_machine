This time, the Marist Pitcher felt more nervous than in any other game(i dunno why leh budden its the easiest team leh...).Marist Team let in 2 runs in the very first inning and thought this would be the end. BUT, we bounced back and scored the maximum 7 which again inspired the team. Timothy again made a solo homerun, Jia Yuan made another homerun which brought...(how many in aRr..?) This would mean that GeyLang's hope of getting a 3rd place would be gone. It would go to the rightfull owner, Marist. If not for the win against RI, the Marist would not be even here in this 3rd and 4th placing and it might be RI that come. RI were C boys champion in the Nationals. And the Marist won them. Well done C boys Marist. This is the last game of the SRC and GoodBye.~*~Full Time Report By Simhyi~*~
