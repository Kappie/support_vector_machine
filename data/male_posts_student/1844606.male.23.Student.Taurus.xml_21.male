Its more of a question of the rhetorical nature, that is answered by me, thus making it not rhetorical...chew on that for awhile   As far as I know, I have no real fetishes about sexuality.  I know I dig chicks with curly hair, and for some reason, fell into a rut of about 2 years where all women I dug had the initals of LM.  How weird is that?  Anyways, Buddy Holly wears glasses.  Its how the name came about.  But sometimes she doesn't wear them.  And she doesn't look hot at all.  More ape-like. I'm a guy, I can't explain it any better.  Its like her cheekbones are too curved and longish in the wrong places.  The glasses give more symmatry to her face.  Has anyone else noticed a phenominon like this, where someone can be dead on sexy with one thing and look completely different (and not attractive) without it?  Not like I think about this chick much, I just can't help but looking at her in class.    We also play a game of "catch the other looking at the other"  Kind of cool I guess, potentially embarassing.  She's a tough cookie to crack.  I pretty much gave up on her last year.  But who knows.
