Here are some pointers to ensure the security of your computer as well as your data.      Make sure that you have a updated  urlLink Anti-virus software  and definitions. Search for “Anti Virus” for the latest updates.     Check your computer for spyware that may be capturing your passwords and user names as well as tracking your surfing habits. I recommend  urlLink Ad-ware .     Don’t open any unknown files sent to you by email. Be extra careful if you use Outlook or Outlook Express as e-mail virus are designed to target these low security programs, check for the latest security patches. Personally I use  urlLink Eudora , less virus target it.    Scan any file that you download before you open them    Install a firewall into your computer. This step is complicated but would create a high level of security and peace of mind. I highly recommend  urlLink Zonealarm .    I would happy to answer and help if anyone got any other questions.
