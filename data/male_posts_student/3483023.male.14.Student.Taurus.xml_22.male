This Evening I Had To Go Out The The HS To Get My Picture Taked For My 'ID' For My Wonderful Freshmen Year Next Year! I Fucked Up When They Were Taking The Picture, She Counted Down 3-2-1, Then After That She Said 'Keep On Looking At The Camera Until After It Flashes' And Of Course After She Said 1 I Looked At Her (She Was To My Right) So I Almost Fucked Up My Picture, But I Processed The 'Look Until It Flashes' Fast Enough To Turn Around And Look At The Camera! So She Asked Me If The Picture Was Ok (She Was Doing This All From Her Labby) And I Looked At It, Wasn't My Best Picture, But I Knew If I Took It Agian, It Wasn't Gonna Get Any Better! So Know I Have A 'ID Card' To Carry To School With Me Everyday, Fun! Tomorrow I Think We Are Going Grocery Shopping, Get My Glasses Fixed, And Get My HairCut And Tipped, Sounds Like Fun, Huh? Well, I'm Outta Here, Good Night World, Don't Let The Bugs Bite!!
