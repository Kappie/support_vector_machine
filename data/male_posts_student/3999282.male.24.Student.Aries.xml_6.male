It may not be a big money for others, but it is certainly big for me ^_^ I am glad that I made the right dicision yesterday not to choose the previous financial advisor. The FA today is so nice to me and let me feel safe when I put my money into the balanced mutual fund. Now it is time for me to continue my molecular biology reading and get ready for my new graduate student life.
