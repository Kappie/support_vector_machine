But I  urlLink share the reservations  of the party...while I don't like the neo-liberal slant many Democrats (sans Dennis Kucinich) are taking, I don't want George Bush in power any longer.     urlLink Benny Mardones  fascinates me.  He probably shouldn't...an old, pudgy rocker living in Syracuse with a band called The Hurricanes who only had one hit in his career.  But the hit is one of those songs that keeps coming back to me, usually at night, in a dimly lit setting, where there is a breeze or a chill and I want a coat or a girl to keep me warm.  One song...poor lyrics, not much to focus on musically except a xylophone introduction and several backup singers during the bridge...but not yet have I ever heard a song where someone put more of themselves into the music.  And this isn't just a knee-jerk reaction to someone holding my hand and this song being on the radio, or the simplicity of many 80s synthesized songs that lack any sort of bass or multi-instrumental bends that are witty at first but hollow the more you hear them...every time I listen to his song, I try to find the holes, and instead he leaves me slack-jawed, longing for his soul to continue speaking to me.    Work is good, but not inspiring at the moment.  I'm having fun, reading a lot, worrying about a few things.  I'm censoring the blog.  Censorship is so interesting.
