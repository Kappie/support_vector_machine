I want to do more of that, and more spontaneous outbursts. It feels SO GOOD to use my talent for GOD!! It's like he's an amplifier, and he has all these wonderful pedals to tweak and refine my sound. OO I'm getting all metaphorical with music.! NOOOOO I've gone new-aged!   Writing.. It will come. I might even trash some former songs.. maybe morph them into one UBER song. ha. I'll work on arrangement and melody (definitely melody... need something unique) Then again, I keep coming back to really old songs that I heard when first a Christian and I didn't fully appreciate them at the time. Now I feel as if those songs have multiplied their meaning by a hundred times. It's wild, it's cool.. It's GOD, babe!! lol.. NOT GODBABE. Two words.  Keep it real, J-Dawg. Never EVER forget about what God has done in your life. (If you forget, you are the biggest asshole that I know!) Woot! Go Jesus, it's your birthday. We gonna party like it's your birthday.. gonna drink Bacar.. Wine like it's your birthday!
