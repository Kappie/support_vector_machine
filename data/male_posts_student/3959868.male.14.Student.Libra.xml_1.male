Once my sister had gotten off the internet, I about pissed my pants when she told me that Rachel called. SHE WAS HOME. I called her and she was about to leave, but her mom answered and asked if she wanted to talk to me before she left. She did. We talked for a while and then I guess she left for somewhere. Rode my bike around town and sawa cop sitting at my neighbors, so I went spy and started following him.  Zach now happy. Well, as happy as I get.
