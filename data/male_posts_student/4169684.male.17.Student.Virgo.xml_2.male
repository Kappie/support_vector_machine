When an action cannot steer a course right Why is it that we feel? When there is a chance that we will be hurt  But as I reflect on my indecisiveness towards fate I realize that this is what makes us human Our choice to be hurt, for a chance at love Our attempt to change destiny, when fate spits in our face Our battle to live, while death stares at us near by We are a species of luck and chance Or so what many think  But at times, one may sit and wonder If our lives have been chosen at random As she becomes wealthy As he becomes famous While others lay in gutters that represent what's left of their battles  What makes fate smile so greatly on one person While another has been forgotten? From birth some are destined for greatness While others have but days to enjoy life This is what has been questioning me As I hope for fates strings to be cut with a knife
