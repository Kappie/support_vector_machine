(yay?) and I feel sure that I'm going to be moved down to Honors calculus but you know what. SO WHAT? I'll be taking calc in college anyway. A lot of people never take calculus in High School at all. Why should I worry so. I'm not wonderful at math.   NYC was fun. We met 1 cousin from my mom's side and 2 cousins from my dad's side. I also met my very old friend Amanda who I haven't seen in a couple months so that was fun. She's doing well. She told me about some site called  urlLink myspace.com  that sounds rather interesting. Another one of those online community things. Sounds like  urlLink orkut  without the invitation thing.      I need to find out when this damn calculus camp is anyways and then maybe chill for a while...Or work....One or the other.
