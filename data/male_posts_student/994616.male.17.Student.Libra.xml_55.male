Oliver Stone with anthony hopkins with Angelina Jolie With  Colin Farrell With Val Kilmer  OR  Baz Luhrmann With Nicole Kidman With Leo  Preparation for his current film role has left Hollywood badboy  Colin Farrell with severe pain in his pants. The Irish star was getting into character for his role as historical legend Alexander  The Great, and injured his groin while honing his bareback horse-riding skills. Colin groans, "I had to ride bareback, which is something I haven't done before. It's a pain in the b*****ks, literally a                pain in the balls. "I have a really sore scrotum. They had nothing in those days so we have had to do the same. And that means no saddles or stirrups."   lol
