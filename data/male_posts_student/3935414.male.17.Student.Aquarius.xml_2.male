Well 4 years for some would be a very long time but to me i felt that time really flies.      Do you know that being a councillor is tough? Though you think that we only go around checking on people, we councillors too have a set of rules that we have to abide to, or else we suffered punishments. Being a councillor really hadletme learn a lot of things. Frankly speaking, without student council, I will not be whom i am today. I changed through the years, from a timid, no confidence, not daring to speak in front of the public person to a dare to speak up person. A more confident person perhaps.          Our batch was also the first batch that went through the six months probation. I can tell you that my first councillors' camp was really really a tough one. Though i could not described in details but i could tell you that you would not like it if you went for the camp. From then on, councillors' camp are like nightmares to me. After the end of the my very first camp, I got my junior badge. That's does not confirm that you are already a councillor. The 6 months probation is still there, anytime you will be sacked. Truthfully, nearing the end of the probation, around four were sacked while two quitted. It was a sad thingyou to seeyour friends leaving the student council. Thus that also marked that the rest remaining had to go for the secondcamp.Whereas, after that it was the passing over of office from the 18th batch to the 19th batch. Also during the 19th student council investiture, for those who passed the probation got their tie and tie pins from the principal's hands on stage in front of the whole school.     It was an honourable thing.          I told you time really flies, it was the last camp befor we took over office. I still remembered that camp clashed with my NPCC adventure training camp, that was why i only went for the first day. I regretted doing so, that's the most stupidous thing that i had done during my secondary school years. It cost me a post in the student council. Or at least give me a chance to prove myself that i am fit to be in the main committee. But i didn't have a chance! I remembered that i brought my 8250 handphone to my ATC camp in ubin and hide it under my undergarments to message people in school so as to get the results of the postings. Shocked that i am a member of some committee. Till now that i believed that it was because of not attending the camp that cost meto be a member. I had been consistent sothere is no reason why i aren't deserved a post!      Though a member, I really felt thatI letmyself down when i got a member.I felt thatI had no face to go into student council room again. I overcome it eventually, getting encouragements from my peers. Really thanks them a lot for pulling me up. I got very involved with council activities, that's whyI love student council so much. I helped the presidents in the printing of docs for the camps. Help in whatever way i could.In the end of my council life, i felt that i had already done my very bestand rendered my 110% service to student councilso i felt satisfied. I never regret that i join S.C. It was S.C who mould me to whom i am today.      JURONG STUDENT COUNCIL  LEAD WITH HONOUR
