I want to keep the slot car one, maybe even show my friend how to update it, so he can do that and I can focus on more creative things that interest me at the moment. I was thinking of a new web name for my site....like www.independentideas.com or creativeideas.com or creativethoughts.com or something like that. So it would be a web site about me and things that I do like write, build web stuff, a little drawing maybe. I want it to have my own built in blog and a message board for people to post ideas, opinions, and comments about anything they want on my site. This is still just at thought so far, we shall see where it goes.
