The 5 year old nods his head in approval. "When we go downstairs I am going to swear first, then you swear after me"  "ok" the 5 year agrees with enthusiasm  The mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 7 year old what he wants for breakfast "Oh Shit mum I guess I'll have cocoapops"  WHACK  He flew out of his chair, tumbled across the kitchen floor, got up and run off crying his eyes out. She looked at the 5 year old and asks him sternly "And what do YOU want for Breakfast young man?"  "I dont know" he blubbers, "but you can bet your Fucking arse it wont be cocoa pops"
