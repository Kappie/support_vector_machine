Sight read and tried a groovy new game in band today.  It's a real toe-tapper.  Bored out of my goddamn mind in Morris, where we just sat there talking about the future, per usual.  Nightengale was really dull WASL practice tests, not much to say.  We started watching Beauty and the Beast in Spanish, which is eating up two days, score.  Cranny had a sub, who apparently does not know how to run a VCR, and ended up making it eat the movie we were supposed to watch.  So it was a free period, which is neat.  I was able to read my Julius Caesar cliffnotes (heh heh heh), get updated on my sports scores, talk to Abe and Alicia, and wonder why the sub was so interested in us.  Klaas ruined  a perfectly good day by actually giving homework.  Argh, so close to a free day!  -  I was stuck at Grandparents' house today, which is fine, because they're cool.  I did some manual labour, earned some cash, saw Steve and Aunt Robin, who I haven't seen since Christmas (Even though they live in Fisher's Landing).  We tried to get Bill running, only to find that the coil was pretty much done for.  -  I got ANOTHER gift card as a late birthday present.  What ever happened to cash?  I'm only joking, I really appreciate it.  (Unless it's to Wal-Mart, that's inexcusable...)  -  I leave you with this....  Roses are red, Violets are blue. It's I against I, And me against you.  Violets are blue, Roses are red. The way we are living, We're already dead...
