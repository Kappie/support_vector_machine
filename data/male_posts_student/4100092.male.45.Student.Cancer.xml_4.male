The movie simply serves as basis for the subject.  As I stated in the first posting it the purpose of the site is to further the idea of the awakening of the human soul. If it is anything it is dedicated to the personal epiphany people can experience.  It is also meant to help people as they begin to walk that awakening out.  In my mind I am thinking of people who are in the process of redefining themselves.  They go to the barber a clean-cut icon of the American boy, they return with a Mohawk.  This is an outward expression of an inward change.  What they are expressing in doing something this radical is that they are different, or at least perceive themselves different. Understanding that is important.    Understanding that when something like this happens; the people that I am intimate with may have something to say about this.  I might lose my job, or even risk losing a relationship.  There are always risks when change is present.  This not to foster the myth that this conflict you experience is even worth it.  The analogy of Cypher in my earlier post was given to highlight the reality that what we experience may be painful, or even confusing.  We may lose sight of why we woke up in the first place.  This is rough and ugly but true none the less, if you are going to continue on the path of awakening then you must realize it will have it's own price tag.  Truth does not come in neat little packages.  You cannot expect that the truth will even meet you on your terms.  This is not something you can control.  When truth is presented (or in my weird view of the world, introduced) it is something I must react to, something I must acclimate toward.  Effort is made to synthesize it into my experience.  In this sense change is not a natural progression, or evolution but a discipline.  What has been your experience with the being made aware of truth?  What change did you have to make as a result?
