If only I could find someone who would have time for me, Someone who wouldn't ignore me, Someone who could listen to me, Someone who would talk to me, Someone...  Then I see something I have never seen, Something that looked like a deception, Do my eyes deceive me? No, my eyes were perfectly clear...  Someone stopped what they were doing, Someone came to me... They said, "Hello."  It was you... Thank you... For noticing me. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I keep asking myself,  Am I worthy enough for you? It's a question that forever plagues me, A question my subconscious always asks me. I don't know the answer. I never did.  I try to find out if I am worthy enough, If I am good enough to be your friend, Yet you still give me the same answer, "It's all right."
