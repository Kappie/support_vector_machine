In the end, we were in there for an impressive 6 hours while yuqi had her hair cut and coloured. At the end, yuqi wasn't entirely happy with the result, but i think it looks really nice :)  while i was waiting in the salon, da bao arrived with 3 large boxes which turned out to be gifts for us. There were 2 large original paintings and some coins over 1000 years old! He's really too kind, and i hope i get the chance to show him around the uk one day in return.  We went back to yuqi's aunty's for dinner. It was very nice with some fresh fish and tomato.  After dinner we popped over to the station in a taxi. Yuqi's parents are missing her, so we'll be travelling back tomorrow. It's gonna be a slightly different train journey; we're going to meet yuqi's brother in beijing first, then catch another train back to her parents in shijiazhuang.  Once we sorted out our tickets, we headed back to da bao's flat and stopped at a night grill restaurant on the way. Here, da bao kept refilling my glass with the local beer until i was quite drunk. We also tasted some delicious spicy beef kebabs.  Once my belly was full and i was rather merry on alcohol, we came back ready for bed. Not sure what the plan is tomorrow, more as it happens!
