This abundance of emptiness in my daily schedule has prompted me to surf the web for odd, unusual and hopefully interesting pieces of information. The following websites served to satiate my appetite for the same. Firstly this is something I came across on another blog the name of which I forget. Google has put up a disclaimer apologizing for its search results for the search term " urlLink Jew ". On further investigation I found out that this was probably because the first result on earlier Google searches for the said term was a site called  urlLink www.Jewwatch.com  which is an anti-Semitic website. This kind of took me by surprise, since Google which in most people's opinion is as objective as anything they have ever known had to hand out official disclaimers for the misplaced efficiency of it's algorithm. Just goes to show that thereare more things you can put up on your websitethan accurate information to get to the top of Google results. The second piece of interesting fun information I found was that the  urlLink world's longest palindrome  contains 17,259 words or if you are really into numbers, 72,046 letters. The creator goes on to say that the sentence does not really make sense, as it is a somewhat random collection of words separated mostly by commas. And I thought, "Sums are not set as a test on Erasmus" didnâ€™t make sense.
