However, achieving personal greatness...that is a good thing. I opted to throw crappy Monday in the throw off so Dan could throw varsity instead of me. However, he only threw 35' and some odd inches. I threw JV shot put and ended up with 39' 5.5" and won the whole shindig!!!  Anyways...go me. The official champion of the 2004 Humboldt Invitational Relays Junior Varsity Shot Put!!!
