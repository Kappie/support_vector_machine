Anyways, the weekend was full of beer, boobs, and RDT (that's raspberry danish twist for those of you who didn't live in the Lodge).  Friday night I took Sammy to El Famous for the first time ever.  I don't think she was too impressed.  I still love it a hell of a lot more than La Bambas.  At El Famous, you at least get the hot pickled carrots and peppers...  Sweet.  In the evening and into early morning, there was a party at Pop's which was a pretty sweet time.  Sam was wasted and for some reason, I was just annoyed.  Maybe it was because of all of the drama from that morning and the fact I had to work.  I still had a good time, especially watching Meathouse try and pick up Laura.  Then at the end of the night, he calls her Julie.  She was like "huh?"  and he was like "that's your name, right?  Julie?"  and then he proceeds to start banging his head against the wall.  Poor Matt...  Saturday, worked at the packed zoo, then had two parties to go to.  First went to Erin G's birthday celebration at Irish Eyes in LP (literally a block north of DePaul) and then we went to the CBJ for Bill and Big Dead's X-mas extravaganza.  It was my turn to get wasted, and I had no money at the bar.  Hell, Sammy had to pay my cover.  Boo to me...  Anyways, Irish Eyes was pretty cool, but I kinda feel weird when I go out with that group of people, because I find I don't really have much to converse with.  They all have jobs and real lives, and I still live at home and work at the zoo.  So that was a tad bit awkward.  But then a little walk to Bill's who conveniently lived about a mile away and I was surrounded by Lodgers of all ages.  I think I did a little bit better at this point, as with the Lodgers I have more shared experiences, and the funny stories of stupid shit we did are endless.  So I got drunk on about 6 beers and a very large egg nog.  Mmmmmm egg nog.  When the brandy burns your lips when you take a sip, you know its good.  And you were too runk to pour your own drink sensibly.  Hey, it happens.  It was cool because Sammy was a great sport and didn't leave until about 3:30.  Everyone else was basically gone, but then the RDT showed up and so did Scotty and Jeff May.  That was fun.  So all in all, it was a very good night and I just hope Sammy had a fun time this weekend too.    My hip still hurts.  Yesterday morning, I fell down the stairs while on the phone with Sammy.  Tony thought we were being attacked.  Foot just slipped out from under me.  Gotta admit, it was pretty funny, but very painful.  Large rug burn on my ass.  Damn.  Christmas is less than a week away.  And I just keep getting more and more depressed.  Wow, this sucks.  Maybe things will be better by New Years...
