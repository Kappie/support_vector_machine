I have begun the task of finally seperating from my biological father. Everything is complete except for my name change, which I can legally do when I turn 18 in May. The only problem is college applications (due before May) ask for a full legal name, which would mean I would have to use his name. So the last thing he has that is connected to me or my sister is our last names. He has no visitation, he pays lots of money every month in child support and he has a restraining order against him. But yet he would not say, yea I'll sign the papers. He said nope nope nope. So now instead of just droppin a few papers in the mail for a signature, I get to go to court with an attorney and do all that crap. It's a pain but he should not underestimate me. He thinks I'll be all like "oOo....he said no, so John will just give up and keep my name". This is not funny. I will change my name before school starts one way or another. heh...I just got off the phone with my mom and she hung up on me...cause she said something and I said something back regarding this issue...and apparantly she didn't like what I said...Anyways...I will get what I want, when I want it, just as it has always been. My mom is gonna call the attorney and fix this mess...then I will finally be 100% free. That's my rant for the day, now how about what happened. Today I woke up late, went to the orthodontist's office to check my permanent retainer and then I went to pizza. I met Alex after that and we hung out for a ton of hours, we did everything from getting her hair done, to looking at cell phones...so its been a good day. I love my life, I just hate messy parts of it...no worries, I'll fix this, just as I have every time before. G'nite all.
