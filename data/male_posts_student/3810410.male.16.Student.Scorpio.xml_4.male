Now that you are gone for good Does it help you sleep better at night, knowing I’m not alright? You don’t have to leave  I have dreams, I have hopes I can breathe, and I can choke But nothing that you can say can reassure my beliefs that you are wrong You don’t have to leave now We can make it if we try  Don’t let this moment pass you by You don’t have to leave  Nothing that you say or do can replace your goodbye
