But there is still a lot of work to be done and the only class I really have to worry about is American Studies which conveniently counts as 2 classes. Right now its either kinda slack off and get the B's which would put me at a 3.66 or tuff it out and go for the 4.0 which I've never had before. Iono its really hard at the end of school to be like ok im gone do something and even though I've worked hard all semester everything depends on this last week. Lets count up shall we I've got my President mini-project to do, the video to film, a research paper to do and a portfolio to finish and then finally I will be done and off to a summer of occasional disarray but overall a little less stressful the school.
