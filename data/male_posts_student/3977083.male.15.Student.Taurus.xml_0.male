To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.  To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.  To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.  To think only of the best, and to expect only the best.  To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as your are about your own.  To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements of the future.  To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.  To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have not time to criticize others.  To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy for permit the presence of trouble."                                                        - Christian Larson     I know it sounds somewhat cheesy, but it does have some good points.  Hehe, in other words "Have a good day,"   ^_^   .
