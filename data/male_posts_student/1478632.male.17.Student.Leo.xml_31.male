Today, wehn I woke up, I remembered him telling me this and for some reason it stayed in my mins all through school and afterwards too. Most of the time I wouldn't have given it a second thought if Ben called me a dipshit--it happens almost hourly--but for this one instance, I just couldn't forget about it. And for some reason, it was this one thought that got me through the day. I don't quite know why, but I guess it was Ben that made me feel a lot better. I guess it was a kick in the ass that I needed more than anything. When we were talking, it suddenly came across me that, yes, my problem was pretty tough for me, but there are people out there who have it much worse off that I ever have. I don't know any, but they're probably out there somewhere. I guess "I still want to be good friends" means Laura doesn't want to talk to me anymore. It's her loss. Tomorrow night we're having a LAN party at Seth's house. Everyone is invited, as we're pretty resourceful when we need to get stuff. Seth is going to boost a few tables from work if he needs to, and last time they made a table out of computer cases. Ben uses laptops as mousepads, and we use Seth's little brother to vent any gamerage we build up. He's one angry little freshman, so it won't do any harm to make him a little more mad, will it? Today was the start of the Track and Field team's season, so I went to the meeting. I don't know if I can work and do track at the same time... Ordered my class ring today too. $159.64 at Wally World--you can tell by the .64 at the end (not .99 or .95, but .64)--compared to $350.00 for the same one... Nothing else of note happened today, so I guess I'm off to that magical land called sleep.
