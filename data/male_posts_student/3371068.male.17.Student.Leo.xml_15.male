Satanism is apparently the most pro- happiness religion out there. If you are disilussioned with all those sissy relgions about self sacrifice and long days of prayer and beggin forgiveness, i suggest you look into it. I haven't spoke to Mandy or Emily or Becca face to face in a long time and I'm hoping that I get to see Mandy and Emily before they both leave. Unless I did something to make them dislike me. In which case I guess I'd better just put them to the back of my mind. I do that with alot of dissapointing situations. Forget.  Look away *giggles*
