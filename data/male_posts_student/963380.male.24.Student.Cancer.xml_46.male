The only thing that irked me was the music - for God's sake, we got the point in the first one, more inspiring speeches backed by insipid music really aren't needed anymore - Pete, for Pe... er... for you own sake, try to have someone inspire us all to the sounds of silence in the background. The Battle for Helm's Deep was appropriately asskicking. It's funny that Sauron's army were faceless bastards wearing turbans...  Possibly the best part of the film was Andy Serkis as Smeagol/Gollum... There's a scene were he's got to make up  his "minds" and the dialogue is delivered phenomenally well.  I just saw a television ad for the "Casual Sex" Dateline. That's a little fucked.    urlLink This  is the funniest picture of all time.
