There is like, only one person that will actually talk to me, and that's Bonny. All other conversations I have to start myself. I feel so unloved sometimes... It's not like anyone's going to read this anyway. I doubt anyone will actually look at my profile, much less my blog, whatever blog's supposed to mean... *sigh*
