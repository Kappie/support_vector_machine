It was pretty cool... damn tired and i feel so one kind this morning... damn.. fOOd was gr8.. no chicks though... but it was cool.... anywayz... wrote this cause i feel at a damn lost... i had to go for this party and missed another party... a close friend of mine party... she and i go back long long time ago... i really couldnt go cause i promised a friend that id go to his party for his gf.... I bet my other friend doesnt want to talk 2 me anymore.... so im just writing this to tell her someway or get it to her somehow... that i will always love her... and that i hope she can forgive me... and take care of herself ler.... pEace
