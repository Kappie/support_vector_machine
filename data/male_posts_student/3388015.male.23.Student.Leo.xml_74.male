My landlord was a complete jerk and demanded I get a female, spayed declawed cat.  I got him to allow her claws.  He then promptly hung up on me.  I just wrote a huge blog post and realized I already posted Saturday's post.  A complete waste.  I was actually funny in this one.  We shopped at Petco in Pittsford, got a bunch of toys, came back to the apartment, played with the cat, put a couple things away and then I headed to Seneca Falls with the cat for my uncle's birthday.  The cat enjoys walking everywhere in the car while I drive.  She did finally fall asleep on my lap for most of the car ride.  The picnic was fun, the cat was a hit but I came back to Rochester and started a load of laundry.  The cat explored the apartment while I cleaned, put stuff away and then did 2 loads of laundry.  I had to go buy a sandwhich from Pelligrinos to get $3 in quarters.  I took the wet laundry and the dry cat to Cindy's to dry my clothes, for free.  The cat enjoyed Cindy's rats, Cindy enjoyed the cat.  Cindy gathered her laundry and we headed to my place to wash it.  While the clothes washed, we went to the Distillery and ate wings and Margaritas.  Lime ones to be exact.  There was salt on the glass and it got into my cut.  I think the cat cut me, I'm not sure.  After we left there we went to Super Walmart, by this time it was well after midnight and I was already getting tired.  We shopped for who knows how long, but after piling a million things into the cart, we checked out.  It came in just above $100, what I had guessed.  Cindy guessed closer to $150.  I dropped Cindy off at her dorm with all her clothes and I put all the food away (for the picnic) and made a simply blanket bed on the floor and the cat and I went to sleep.  She likes to sleep on my neck.
