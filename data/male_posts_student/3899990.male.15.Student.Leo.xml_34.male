I had to buy a small binder for Photo (yahooooo another one to carry around) and this storage club was on clearance for $6.00 so I got that too.  I finished some of my homework (which took about 5 minutes), did some cleaning, and I'm now watching the Olympics.  There's only 5 more days till the weekend...
