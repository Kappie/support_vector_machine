I will comment on a lot of things; politics, life, philosophy, the severe lack of correct spelling on the internet. Anything that I think of. I am 15 years old and I live near Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. I may seem young to some, but I have some very set views which WILL be set forward whether people like it or not.
