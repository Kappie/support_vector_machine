For those who don't know, Mel's story is an inspiring manifestation of the American Dream.  I am supporting Martinez because I trust that he will fight for lower taxes and smaller government, a stronger military, and a secure homeland.    The other candidates in the primary are qualified and would, no doubt, make excellent Senators.  However, Martinez represents our best chance of sending a Republican to Washington, and electability has its place in politics.    And given the  urlLink buffoon who currently calls himself our Senator , we sure could use some good old fashioned GOP relief right about now.  If you are interested in helping to send a conservative to the Senate, let me know and we'll get you involved immediately.
