It just kind of sucks cause i freaking got SOOOOOOo attached to it.  Like, that's something that always happens to me, i get attached to like, everything, pens, (hehehe, one more letter...) notebooks, u name it.  Sometimes it's rediculous, but w/e, that's just me.  ...so?? what have i done u must be asking yourself? lol, well, let's see..i  went to jones' house alot, and hung out with freinds alot,  dosn't get any more simpler than that.  I frankly don't remeber much cause i stayed up so late, but w/e, all i know is that i was there, and it was good times.  I spent alot of time with lilia, which, ofcourse, was awsome, but, OF COURSE  and  urlLink Jones'  house, so i decided to see if she was free, just to hang out atleast.  Well, after a apparent convincing, she got to go, BUT, i had to meet her mom, no big deal, right?!? WRONG!!! lol, i have this thing about first impressions, like, i hate hearing anything bad about myself, or any thing like that, so i got this thing with first impressions, like, i got to have them run smoothly.  Well, after some gel, contacts, and a spiffy shirt (thanx dad), i headed off.  And i must say, it wasn't that bad at all, i acutally thought i was gonna get asked to some tea, and then get interogated by her mom, but it was ok, no big deal. I still have to talk to Lil though, cause i have NO idea what she thinks about me! (sorry i haven't called btw, i meant to today, but today was just to hecktick....thats how u spell it right?) But anyway, we went off, and decided we were going to chill at a park....Senasqua anyone?  SUREE...cause apprently it was that movie night thing, and there were lot's of people.....ya, i don't think they'd appreciate there kids looking at 2 teenagers making out...lol, that would be so funny though...ANYWAY, we turned back, and decided that Croton was the prime place to be! RIGHT oh'! anyway, before i go any further,  let me just say, being with her is fucking amazing....ok, ONWARD! we get there, and we just walk around talk, which was great.  I was determined to show her my better side (my back side!!! woooo!!!!) and hopefully she saw it.  We talked alot, until the Super dooper PARK RANGER showed up...jeez, they should have let us stay, it's not like we were going to rape some squirrels or anything.  But w/e, we left, and ended up going to the train station.  we just sat back, and talked...lol, i bet all the guys are like "WTF!?! you didn't make out with her!?!", well, no, but that's totally fine with me.  I think i've said this before, but i really don't want to be to pushy with this relationship.  I acutally honest to god like her, and i acutally want to try and be with her for a long time, so, i'll just do what she wants to do, unless told otherwise...;o) lol, but yea.  My clock read 10, so we had to go...my curfew (?) was like 9:30....her's was 11, but thats ok, cause it shows i'm responsible!!!! ( yay!!) anyway, that was the night, and it was fucking awsome...  the next day, or as i like to call it, TODAY, was alright.  I took alot of shit from the kids about loosing my Ipod, i guess i kinda deserved it, but whatever. Summer school isn't to bad...acutally, it's painstakingly EASY, plus, i got the world famous Ceaser Alvarez in my class, so it's gonna be the shit.  got home, napped again, got up, ate, napped, got up, went to Jones', and came back to write this.  At Jones' we all just hung out (andy, me, jorge, Mike, ben, and sabby).  Mike took alot of shit as usual, which i really hate to see, but i hope he see's it's all in good fun.  ya, and i fucking hate milk.  Most of u know i can't drink it....no, it's not cause i'm lactose intolerant, but cause of the taste..and smell.....yuck, like, i always throw up....but i do love CHOCOLATE MILK!!! and any other flavor they decide to use to mask the mile one.  I'm saying this because, as i chocolate lover, i have to advocate....lol, no, it's cause that's THE ONLY THING TO DRINK IN THIS HOUSE....that, and water...which i have been drinking, which is fucking awsome i might add.  people have to update there freaking blogs more often!! I need my daily fixin!! i need it dammit!! it's the only reading i ever do, so i'f your reading this, and have a journal (which u prolly do) update it!!    shit....i think this entry took me an hour to write, cause it's already 11....w/e though, tomarrow's friday, and all i want to do is be with freinds, more specifically, my amazingly smart, cute, awsome, fun, etc, etc, g/f. (there i go again...)lol, i'm sorry guys....i am.....lol, ya, so, whats the line up? summer school, and chillin.....oooo yea.....BBQ's and Parties this weekend are gonna be crazy by the way..  Accidentally falling,  Stevie poo (?)
