Do you have phone lines in your rooms? if you do then you could use it that way, but I'm sure that has already been thought of.
And a deffinate yes to the Gangster film, it'll be a laugh.
Unfortunately I'm going to Paris on the 14th and then to Corfu on the 19th or 20th of July and going for 2 and 1/2 weeks, so unfortunately I wont see you for a while but we will still have time for the gangster film :). Anyway have fun beating IT geeks and drinking hope to see or hear from you soon I'll smack sam up a bit and get him to post something.

 Hey bro

Exams are going ok actually, not too painful yet, Chemistry was nice today and bio wasn't too bad. I have my last one 2moro morning - Stats!!! Then party on, oh yeah, gigidy gigidy! The site is way cool, thanks for keeping it up. Its good to hear that you are doing ok with exams, beside your Dr Faustus, don't worry mate, it'll be fine. Our head giving IT geek won't unblock blogger.com, he says that its because people might post bad things about the school etc.... what crap, stupid nerd!! But i'll keep looking, its really interesting, like a texual big brother or diary. I'm looking into getting on of those vodafone connect cards (depending on prices etc) so i can don things like this from my lapy.

YES! Ripping it out of the Germans on D-Day was a lot of fun, and watching the german episode of faulty towers too, yes, good, good.

Well, look forward to the summer and parties galore! I get back to norfolk around the 15th July i think, then leave on the 12th August, not too long....... so best make the most of it. I'm holding you to that ganster film...... what ya rekon?

I'll keep looking, say hi to sam. I'm gonna keep bugin the IT techs to unblock it, see where i get.

Anywhoos, revision to attend to now, then excessive drinking from mid day friday onwards and forever!
