It's nice every once and a while to be able to enjoy some quiet time even if it was only about 45 minutes and, mind you, I spent that time doing homework. I spend a lot of my time now doing homework. Maybe I'm obessing a bit too much over it because I can't remember the last time I was able to play a video game without having a guilty conscience. Seriously, it's a pain in the butt. Do you know how much I would love to just read a book of MY choice. Pendragon #5 comes out soon and it's only my favoritest book series in the world. I think I need to reward myself and get it. But that doesn't mean I can forget about "The Good Earth" and "OneDay in the Life of Ivan Denishovich." They have to get read too. Ah I'm rambling now. I finished my history report day. It is such a relief to have it out of the way. I used a secret method while writing it though. I called it "pacing myself." I would write a sentence or too, go onto the pendragon website, talk a bit there, go back, write a sentence or two and I continued this process until it got done. It wasn't distracting. It helped me stay focused on my assignment strangley... Rachel had a friend come over today along with the twins. For some odd reason, she found it necasarry to show them my bedroom. 0_0 I kinda shrugged her off in front of her friends and played the part of tough andsuperior older brother. It's funny watching her friends look around my room. It's even funnier to see them nervous around me. Ahahah it's fun being the oldest. I love the power...
