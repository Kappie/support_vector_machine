"Dial 119 for the FIREMEN!" I don't know it just doesn't really work for me.  That leads to loss of water the so called "firemen" of today use tons of it.  What happens when we run out.  No really I have heard people worry about this.  One friend had a pretty convincing theory for the answer to why the earth's water was depleting.  He claimed "People are drinking it all."  These are the type of people that are aloud out on the streets.  They are aloud to drive a car.  Heck they are aloud to get married and reproduce.  Allowing people like this to have children is like throwing a poodle into the cockpit of a space shuttle and saying "Let's see what happens..."  I'll bet that guy is in prison now because he does not strike me as someone that could easily avoid abduction.  I can picture him now in a 10 by 5 cell guzzling water out of the prison tap screaming "THEY'LL PAY!! THEY'LL ALL PAY!!!"  When we do pay, and it is only a matter of time before we do, what will we pay?  By the time our water is completely depleted we probably will not exist any more but if we finally died off who would be depleting all the water.  Holy crackers that's a big one.
