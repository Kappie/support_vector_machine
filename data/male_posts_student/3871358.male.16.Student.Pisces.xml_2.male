This place makes sense too:  urlLink http://www.radiohead.com                      As some of you may know I only recently got back from holidaying in my summer resort on Tahiti. At least that was where I was supposed to be. Unfortunately, on the way over our flight hit a spot of bad weather, forcing us to make our landing on some un-inhabited island in the Atlantic. It was with trepidation that we set foot on dry land, fearing as we did that the natives might be hostile. Our fears were soon proven justified, as seven passengers and all of the cabin crew were taken away and sacrificed to the native’s foul god. Wearily we continued in darkness, not daring to light a fire for fear of drawing attention to ourselves. One by one the passengers perished, until only my family and I remained. Desperate with hunger, and delirious with first, we finally spotted what looked like civilization through the trees. A holiday house, with 6 bedrooms with en-suite shower and toilet, 2 living rooms, a kitchen so large you could quite happily loose an entire battalion of geologists in, and our own basketball and tennis court to boot.                   What followed was a delightful holiday in the Republic of Ireland, spoiled only by the fact that I wasn’t exactly dressed for such a temperate climate:    urlLink       Brrrrrr...    I think I shall leave it at that, for fear of this turning into another one of those wretched “what I did on my holiday reports” (urrrggghhh, 4 th  year prelims, the memorys, nooooooo…) Any way, I’ll hopefully get more pictures up as soon as I can figure out, or get Gordon to explain to me, how the hell you post more than one picture in a post. Until then it’s:    “Good bye from him”                  “I said it’s a good bye from him…”                   “I’m all alone.”                   “So very alone.”                   “*Sob*”                             Thanks for reading                                                           Stay Beautiful                                                                                     Davus
