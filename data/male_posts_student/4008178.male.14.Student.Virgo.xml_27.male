I FUCKED A SLUT AINT I COOL!?"  it pisses me off. specially the way these people look at girls. "sex object only" come on, you couldnt get worse like that. a girl is not a fucking prize. i could go to any fucking place and get a blowjob whenever i cant, but its just not cool. wow your best friend is a slut so you brag about it, but deep inside you know she has fucked basically every other guy you know. thats not fucking cool. it makes you sound like an idiot actually.  anyways, if what you wanna do in your life is be a "fuck machine" go ahead, but youre no better than anyone else around here, and i dont fucking need you scrubbing it in my face, asshole.  thank you.
