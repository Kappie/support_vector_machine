Now we are in December, the Os has past us. What an eventuful year. There are sure a lot of surprises.   I am listening to Perfect 10's Top 100 Countdown. HaHa. Now I listened till number 91 (1pm). Coolies. HaHa. There's a lot of 'tops' features, like Top 10 News Headlines of 2003. The top headline is SARS in Singapore. O.o How newsworthy.  HaHa. This paragraph is gonna get ugly, 'cause there's someone I want to critisize bad. Ha. You would have gussed by now that someone must be WQ. Yes. What a sore loser. Sore with a capital S. That idiot tried to tell me the songs that were coming up next, which I did not appreciate at all la. Therefore, I threatened that wuss with a secret of his (it was that shocking thing I noticed. yes, it was HIS. Now. There you know). Refusing to tell him what was it about and who else knew, he immediately blocked me on his Messenger. (Ayiah, he threatened me with "tell me or else.." I replied back with "or else what? I am not scared by your threats". I expected a blockage, so it came as no surprise.) Worthless arse. Sigh.... Such pettiness. Such idiocry. Such attitude. I doubt he can make it far in life (or even in JC or Poly. Seriously. Neither type of instituition suits him. Come to think of it, neither does ITE. He'll get beaten up within the first second. Forget about CIs. If he can't fit into JC, what makes you think he can fit into CIs?). Tsk tsk tsk. Shape up! Lose your loser attitude! (I doubt he's gonna listen. He's too thick-skinned to.) See la. 2003 ends on a sour note. How sour. (Whoever pisses me off with definitely incur my wrath. A lot of people has learnt that, especially WQ, who has learnt it multiple times. And WQ, forget about rebutting. Your rebuttals are lame. You don't even know how to rebutt properly. I'd love to see ya try though. It's always fun arguing.)  Hmm...oh yes. You must be wondering why I am blogging so early. HaHa. I dunnoe. I just felt like it lor. Tonight have no mood to blog ba. HeHe. (Psst...the above para...I think it's the longest para of this entry. O.o!)  Hmm...dunnoe what to write le la. I guess I'll just end off la. See ya next year! Byes!!
