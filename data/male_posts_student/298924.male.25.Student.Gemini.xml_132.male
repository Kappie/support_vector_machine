In sports....I am officially a World Cup junkie....despite the fact that I drank for 7 hours Friday I still woke up at 6:30 Saturday to watch the World Cup game....go Brazil....the Braves are hot....but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the tragedy in Chicago....St. Louis pitcher Darryl Kile (a damned good pitcher) was found dead in his hotel room....autopsy pending, I really hope it wasn't a murder....  I had more to say....but not now....maybe when my mind is clearer....(hint....it involves women....come on now what else do I think about?....music???...come on now....not anymore)
