Heat + Humidity + Small Room + Mass Computers = Death thru Dehydration. Not to mention I had to run like 100m to reach the busstop in time (I didn't mind  that  that much, since I like running).    Yesterday wasn't that good... some guy in my computer engineering group said he lost 1 hour worth of assignments (luckily he found it again today). I got a bit angry and went to Social Science to cool off a bit ^^;; that worked... actually got some work done too.   Ah... now back to working on Computer Science... stupid Watcom Basic --;; ah well, almost done this unit ^^;;   ~Chronos
