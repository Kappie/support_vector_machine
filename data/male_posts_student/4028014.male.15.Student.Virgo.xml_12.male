THere nothing much and nothing special to bring the atmosphere up... It wasn't the celebrtion i dreamt of... Really  really bad... Next, I'm so fed up that Mrs Lee went up to the stage and scolded the Master of Ceremony. I mean if their performance was bad, she shouldn't scold them infront of all the people! Its really very hurtful to get shame by our principle, and its worst when she shames you infront of every single pupils!  Next, the fun fair... Its completely lame... Nothing much to play or buy... First, went to the haunted house II, thinking that it will be really scary but never expected that we went out of the house laughing heartily... When we enter the room, Wen Long starts screaming ( he was just pretending to )... I can't help but keep laughing loudly when i heard his screaming and the "ghosts"... Haha... Well, their make up were kind of good but it just don't scare us out of our wit... Not sure why, but it doesn't leaves me a very strong impression...  Finally, after school, we went to Ling Feng's house and changed to civilian clothes and prepare to went out and play pool... Yes... Finally... This is the onli event that i enjoyed most today... THere were alot of people in there and we had to wait for long hours before we could actually play... The game that i remembered most is the one that i've playeed with Jonathan... Yes... Its a game well played... If its not for him (he hit my striped ball with the white ones accidentally, causing two of it to fell into the hole), he might win me... Yes... Thanks Jon...  Another person to thank... Marianne, She paid for the expenditure we've spent on one table... I believed it's expensive... Really thanks alot... Yes... Well, after the game, its really very tiring... I dozed off in the bus immediately... Thank goodness i didn't miss my stop... Haha... Any way, i really enjoyed the game very much... Hope we can play it again...   That's all i've got to write... Been a tiring day... *Yawn* Take care folks!
