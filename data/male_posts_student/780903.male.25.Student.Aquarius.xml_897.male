And so we have three weeks in January where we get to (get to!  I mean have to!) take another class.  Three weeks, classes meet every day, same number of total classroom hours as a normal class but instead of twice a week for an hour and a half each session for 15 weeks, it's 3 hours a day, every day (no weekends) for 3 weeks.  They do this in part so they can get some guest professors in who can't come for a whole semester but can do this 3 week thing and teach some different and special courses (like Food and Drug Law, which is a popular one here).  Or so people can do cool clinical stuff.  Or the Negotiations Workshop, 9AM-5PM every day, pass/fail, no exam.  But a lot of classroom time.  Ouch.  And they also have normal classes taught by regular professors, but condensed.  I'm taking one of those.  Secured Transactions.  With reading and a problem set every night.  And an exam at the end.  So that's what I'm up to for the next three weeks.  That was so unfunny.  But I guess there are probably some people out there reading for content.  ;)
