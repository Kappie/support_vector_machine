I have math and Biology homework, and I am sure I have other homework tonight in Music. I am just feeling a bit overloaded.   The "Site o' the day" today is Lissa Explains it all (for those of my generation: remember Clarissa Explains it all? Not the same thing). Lissa Explains is a website for HTML help. Not many people use HTML everyday like I do, but a few do. The owner of this site (presumably a girl, when you view the site) makes HTML easy. Very organized and the like.  Day 11 of the new school year:  Math: *YAWN* Boredom. I finished my English essay in this class, mostly all of it. Made up a few creative subjects, and just went to it. Normally, I like writing, but I wasn't very inspired in this subject. I guess it has to be inspiring for me to be more interested.   English: Well, it took us more than half an hour to get off the topic of September 11th. All the reasons it happened, all the reasons we even got into it and the like. A lot of people had said that we brought it on ourselves. The teacher actually said, to the class, that we had lost faith as a nation. We were cruel, heartless and hard to please as a generation. He said that one of the top reasons that we have so many gun related casualties is because we were a generation not brought up in church. That shocked a lot of people, because most of them do go to church, but not for the reasons they are supposed to. Most of them are forced to get up every Sunday morning, put on nice clothes, and act like a perfect little marionettes, doing everything their parents tell them to. I was not shocked. I think it is true. As a generation and a nation we have lost faith in God. This has inspired me to make more of an impact on my campus. Although throughout the whole thing I didn't say a word. I wanted to, but I didn't want to get in trouble for any religious ideas I might bring into the class. In hindsight though, I should have anyways. Than we read by ourselves in  Speak . Than he checked to make sure our rough drafts of our essays were done (I thought they were our final copies). Yea, that's about it.  Lunch: Food, not as exciting as English. Lenny did find his Visual Basic animation. It was pretty entertaining. But that's mostly because we are easily amused.  No class: This is my free period. I got my homework for the class I had next all done at this time. It was quite funny, since I was doing my homework in the classroom in front of the teacher, and she was helping me occasionally.  Biology: Made a few wise-cracks in it. Mostly read  Left Behind . Finished  all  my homework for that class, during the time she assigned and explained it. I love being able to do stuff on my own, generally without direction.  Home: Err, this isn't really a class, just what I call everything after school. I had to get an unexcused absence cleared up. I did, walking halfway across campus like four or five times. Very annoying. I got home, and I did my music homework, and here I am. I will add a chapter to TSG tonight, maybe, if I don't for sure tomorrow.   Have a great night everyone. Playboy Hugh Hefner ran off two monks trying to sell flowers on his property; which many people had been trying to shoo away for a while. When asked for a comment one of the monks said "Only Hugh can prevent florist friars."
