Yuki didn't speak English, so it was first good chance to listen to a conversation in Japanese. I was pleasantly surprised.  After hearing everyone rant about how much high school Japanese is useless in the real world, I was a little shocked to find I could understand people. Not very well, mind you. But on average about one word a sentence. This made it rather easy to figure out  what  people were discussing. I just failed if anyone spoke to me. But not to fear, my Japanese improved quite a bit while I was there, if I may say so myself. A few things I picked up rather quickly.  a) While we had been taught subject was implied when possible, I soon figured out  everything  was implied when possible. While the very useful particle  ka  is devoted solely to marking when a statement becomes a question, I never once heard this used in casual speech. Instead, people just raise their voice, very similar to another language I'm fluent in. It still took a long time to adjust to listening for this in Japanese though.  b) People never use 2nd person pronouns. Ever. I only heard them when being addressed to generally, such as an announcement in a department store. Indeed, the first thing people do when they meet you is ask you what your name is(with implied subject of course). You may think it's like this in English too, but it's really not. If you think about it you'll realize how many times you have conversations with people without them knowing your name and vice-versa.  c) People say  sumimasen  every chance they get. On the train you hear it every five seconds right before someone headbutts his way passed you. This is a culture with the only acceptable apology being one prefacing the "sin". On the off chance someone makes a rude gesture they weren't expecting, they usually hope any included parties don't notice. If they do feel like apologizing, which I assure you was very rare(I probably heard more people apologize in English..actually, I definately did), they don't just stick with a  gomenasai , oh no. They bow 23 times with  gomenasai 's coming out so fast I seriously wondered how they didn't lose their voices.  We went shopping. Specifically, we went to the 100 Yen shop, to buy umbrellas. Then we plowed through more people to get to "The Loft", a three-story stationary store which entranced Jenny and seemed very loved by Tina as well. I seemed more interested by the fifth floor, part of an electronics store. This floor had video games, DVDs, and a whole hell of a lot of hentai in the corner(Of particular interest to me was Bible Black the DVD PC Game.)  I could spend 18 paragraphs talking about the video games....but I won't. It was as I was expecting. Giant "monuments"(honestly, they were way past meager displays) to games like Final Fantasy X-2 and XI. Giant bookcases of 500-page strategy guides, etc. etc.  We ate sushi for lunch. Maybe I was just imagining it, but I could have sworn this sushi was many times better than any sushi I had ever had before. It's possible, right? I mean, we were in Japan!  Afterwards, we said goodbye to Tina and Yuki and took the train to Akihabara, the electronics capital of Japan. When we got off the train I saw a poster that reminded me that this year was the "Revival of Evangelion", which meant merchandising oppurtunities. We left the station and I had a minor heart attack...or I would have if I had been 20 years older.  Imagine New York City...except every one of those giant buildings was either an electronics store or an arcade. My favorite store was "Gamers". This was an 8-story building with video games, manga, anime, and merchandise for all of them. I bought a few things here. a) Neon Genesis Evangelion 01 Test-Type, which is a preview of the new digitally remastered box set. To me the highlight of the DVD is the music video set to the full version of "Zankoku na Tenshi no Teze" It's beautiful. b) A new Evangelion CD that features several versions of "Zankoku na Tenshi no Teze" and "Fly Me to the Moon". It's cute. c) An adorable Ayanami Rei in Christmas garb action figure. I call her "Santa Rei". It also came with a special edition of the manga, which of course I can't read. d) "The Birthday of Ayanami Rei" CD. Unlike the first CD, this one isn't new. It's from 2001, when Rei was born :). This has an awesome new version of Cruel Angel's These sung by Hayashibara Megumi, which is easily the best of the alternate versions I've heard. It also has her singing Fly Me to the Moon, and THANATOS - If I Can't Be Yours. In addition, it also has Rei's theme songs, along with some other Rei related BGM from both the show and the movies. It's really cool. e) "The Black Mages", which is a bunch of Final Fantasy battle music remixed as rock. It's kickass. f) "Final Fantasy IV:Celtic Moon, which, as one might guess, is FFIV music remixed all Celtifyingly. It's beautiful."  The arcades there are amazing. Aside from being multi-story, they have everything. The crane games(there was a whole floor devoted to them) had several with Evangelion figures(one of them had this beautiful Wedding Series, which were either Asuka or Rei dressed in a wedding dress. I wasted too much money on that one trying, but in the end I failed.) and one that caught my eye that contained several different Final Fantasy X-2..clocks. It was interesting. The fighting games occupied 2 stories. Strangely enough, most of the fighting games I saw were 1-player, making me wonder why they're so popular there. I didn't see DDR in any of the arcades I went to, I was dissapointed.  We went home. Tina made supper, yadda yadda yadda. All in all, today made my wallet cry in pain.
