She kills me again, over and over, cold steel once warm which I treasured having inside me. That which keeps me alive, never ceasing, pumping, is also my enemy. He works against me, malignant tumor.  Why does this occur? I ask of thee to not misunderstand my intents. I complain not and, fully, am I aware that everyone endures the same punishment as I. All I ask is why? We request it not, yet it is. Romeo died with Juliet and Paris killed because of it. Why is it that something so immensely and indescribablly beautiful; tenders too, the most intense and immense anguish and grief. Grief prolonged by the wanting of it and subdued by that which kills. In the words of a great poet of my time, why'd you have to go make things so complicated. Why love? Why?
