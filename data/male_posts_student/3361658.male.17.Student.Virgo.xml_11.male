No, i will not tell you my deepest, darkest secrets. However what I can tell you about are the funny things that I come across in my day. For instance; Keith Marvel getting hit in the head with a lacrosse ball and falling to the ground, he then proceeded to 'curse up a storm'. Now that happened a while ago, but it is by far the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. So expect to hear about more things just like that.
