This is know normal movie, it's not a fancy hollywood production, and it's not at all pretty. It is, in fact, a REVELATION. The official documentary .  Life And Times In McMinnville   Ah, yes, Levi Fairbanks's directorial debut, an epiphany of pure scientific genius. Not for sell anywhere, and a rare find, but if you have the luck to get your hands on a copy, you, too, will be able to revel in it's pure brilliance, such a gem that you might have to wear sunglasses while you are watching.  Anyway, this is LSF, the creator. This isn't just a blog for my movies, it's also my INNER-SANCTUM.
