I seem to be doing less revision than I may have first planned but, I think, I may be doing my revision beter because I seem to be learning from it/actually remembering it. This is quite a surprise to me, but it seems that it isn’t the quantity, though some hard graft may be needed, of the work, but the quality: setting my mind to work constructively. As I have always said boring your mind with endless hours of reading wont help to revise. I have come back to writing this post after a couple of weeks because of many set backs such as the mentioned exams and the fact that I formated my computer but the show is going on. i am now at the end of my exam period with all my exams except History paper two out of the way. This is quite a relief as history probably has the largest amount of information to learn and understand. My school has chosen to do the Schools History Project sylabus which is probably the most interesting of the sylabus as you get to study the history of medicine (very gory i assure you) and you get to study the cowboys and indians of the wild west but unfortunately they hardly ever met.This is the exam that I am studying for at the moment so i should get back to the revision but all those dates seem to be getting the better of me!
