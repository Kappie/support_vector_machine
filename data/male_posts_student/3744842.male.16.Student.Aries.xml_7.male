I was dead asleep but it woke me up, i was in a dazed state and just took her to where she needed to be then went inside and took a shower and woke up. Then another really funny thing happened. Me and melinda scheduled appointments to get our haircuts, mine right after hers with the same lady at the same place.................and we didnt plan it at all!............she didnt even know i got my hair cut at this place, now tell me that isnt pretty cool. Then after that a couple of my buddies, j.w. and david came by and we messed around for a little while...........didnt do anything to stupid though. Then after that i went to chik-fila to get some dinner. After that i went to watch October Sky.........it wasa great movie, but the company was better. All in all a wonderful day i would re-live anytime.
