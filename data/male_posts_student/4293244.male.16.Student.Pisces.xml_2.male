I’m not sure if it still exists but it doesn’t really matter because I have no interest in seeing it again. Heaven’s Peak is a nice name but the road that goes up the center is aptly titled Tumbleweed. The road was there before the development so it could not have been changed. Heaven’s Peak was supposed to be this little piece of heaven carved out of the dry lake beds that made the Californian Desert home to the Air Force. Let me tell you it was nothing like heaven to me.                 I grew up the son of a pilot. My dad was the best damned pilot in the Air Force or so I was told by my mother and several years later but many high ranking officers. My father was a Wild Weasel which unfortunately for me meant he shipped off to Vietnam early in the war when I was only six. Before that he was gone a lot so it’s safe to say I was raised by my mother. I don’t know when but probably not even a year had gone by before my father got himself in a major dogfight over the skies of North Vietnam. He was always the wily one I have been told and the reports were confusing for a few days but in the end it turned out his entire squadron made it back, except for him.                 He flew with a man named Barry Knowles from Brentwood, Kentucky. Fred Knowles lived just across the street from me for the two years I had lived in Heaven’s Peak. Fred Knowles was three years younger then me and in my eyes a baby. We were told that my father was in a Vietnamese POW camp somewhere deep in the recesses of North Vietnam. Barry how ever was found floating in some little river near the border looking like he had been beaten to death. He was killed in ejection.                 I believe I was thirteen that summer and Fred must have been nine then. It was 1972 and the war was ending. Everyday I would watch people’s daddy’s come home from the war or here and there. They’d all come out and happily greet each other and I’d watch from my room sickened with a combination or rage, hate and sadness. Normally I’d cry for an hour or so afterwards but nobody knew that, I was too old to cry in six years I’d go to college and four years after that I’d become an officer in the Air Force and not long after that I’d fly to Vietnam and kill some of them. I didn’t realize as a twelve-year-old what was happening in that far off country. I didn’t realize the war was ending, I heard people talking but I didn’t believe it.                 That summer was in many ways the end of my childhood. Every summer we’d go out with all the other kids and run around and ride our bikes and wait for the ice cream man to drive all the way out to our little suburb. You see Heaven’s peak was only a housing development, there were no stores and no places to go really unless you had a car. So we’d ride to this kid’s house then this kid planning to play baseball down at the park but by the time we got there half the kids would have dropped off to do other things so we’d only have enough kids to fill the infield. Then we’d go swimming in the pond. I don’t think the pond was created with swimming in mind but kids will swim where ever they can. So we’d swim in that cement pond. Something about Heaven’s Peak always bothered me but I never could say what it was.                 Days like those when there just wasn’t enough kids to play and it was too hot to just play catch me and Fred would sneak off all by ourselves. Sometimes we’d walk out into the desert or go to Fred’s house where it was always air-conditioned and his mom always seemed to be sleeping. Sometimes we’d just sit in one of the small lush parks the developer had put in. The grass was always wet and the dirt smelled of fertilizer because they had to water and fertilize it all constantly or it would all turn brown like the rest of the desert. Although I wouldn’t ever admit it then or for quite some years the boys never got along with me, hell they never liked me. I was always insulting them or telling them that their old man was full of bull. I was a little rude.                 I don’t really know why Fred hung around me. He was too little for my group of friends but getting to old for his group of friends. All of the boys my age ostracized him and told him to go home or play with George Jablonski or one of the other boys his age. He would never listen, always the stubborn one like his father. I was rude to him too but like some faithful dog he never walked away he’d just sink low to avoid more of my verbal blows and follow.                 “I hear that the gooks are gonna have to release the prisoners soon. Then my dad will come home and we can move to somewhere else on the coast or something.”                 “Yeah! And when my dad comes home…”                 “You’re dad’s dead.”                 “He might be a POW.”                 “No they found his body and everything. Remember?”                 “Carl said that it was just a bunch of bricks in my daddy’s coffin.”                 “He was probably right but that’s just cause they couldn’t find enough of your daddy to bury.”                 “Yeah maybe…” He said looking at a blade of grass that he was tearing to pieces. Once he was done with that one he plucked another out of his lawn and started to dissect it.                 “I can’t wait till he comes home. We can move to the other side of those mountains, that’s where my mom says the ocean is. I can get a surfboard and spend all my time at the beach like my cousin.”                 “Yeah I can go with you.”                 “No you’re mom doesn’t want to leave she can’t get out of bed until after lunchtime let alone move to the coast.”                “That’s cause of her night-job, she works the late shift down town. They pay her more to do it.”                 “Maybe.” I said remembering all the empty bottles of gin that’s always lying around. She liked her martinis. “One of these days though, I’m going to get up in the early morning and ride my bike all the way to them mountains then all day I’ll climb until I reach the other side. I can’t wait to see the ocean.”                 “I can go with you.” We both looked across the road to the mountains that were really just some ridges a couple of miles away. They were no mountains and would probably only take a couple of hours to get to the top but for lack of a better word I called them mountains. Some days I figured they might as well be mountains because there is no way I’m getting over them.                 “What do you think it’s like over there?” asked Fred squinting tearing another blade of grass apart strand by strand.                  “Nothing like this. The towns are real, not like this, there’s ice cream trucks, policemen walking around, lots of stores, all kinds of stores. Then there are restaurants so when you feel like it you can go out and get food where ever you want, if you want hamburgers you can have a hamburger and dad can have his steak and mom can too. There’s lots of schools and if you don’t like the kids that live by you then you can ride your bike a few blocks down to your friends from school. The schools are bigger too, they’re more then fifteen to each class, there’s at least forty and there’s at least two schools. There’s a football team and everything. The parks have real trees not palm trees or this wet grass.”                 “I like the parks here.”                 “Then you better stay here because over there everything’s real. The houses don’t all look the same and not everyone is in the Air Force. They have real career days with real doctors, firemen and businessmen. Plus when your teacher asks you what you want to be when you grow up all the boys don’t say F-4 pilot. That’s not even the half of it. At the top of those mountains you can see clear across the town to the golden beaches with this blue waters. You can even smell it.”                 “How far is it to there?” asked Fred excitedly.                 “To the beach? Maybe fifty miles. It’s almost twenty to the mountains and from their top you could probably almost see about thirty miles. Maybe it’s more like forty, I’m not sure. But to drive it will take hours because you have to go through the pass. I remember when I was really little I drove there but I never got to see the ocean. It took about ten hours to drive there.”                 “We’ll never get there then.”                 “Sure we will, we don’t have to go around to the pass why we can climb straight over. I went hiking over there when I was in the boy scouts, it wasn’t too hard we made it about a hundred feet from the top but the scout master wouldn’t let us go to the top because it got dangerous to climb. If we ride our bikes real fast on the road and we hike real fast we could probably make it as long as we left just before sunup.”                 “When are we going to do this?” He asked.                 “I told you when they release my dad. Then after that we can move there once my dad come home.”                 “Yeah me too.”                 “I told you Fred you’re dad’s dead, he has been for years. That’s why your mom’s a drunk.”                 “She is not a drunk!”                 “Is too!”                 “Well your dad is a bastard!”                 I punched him in the face as hard as I could. I jumped on his chest and started drilling in his face. I could see some blood I didn’t care. Some guy was yelling at me. I ignored him. Next thing I knew this big guy wearing a flight suit had me by the elbow and was damn near lifting me off my feet. I started swinging at him but who was I kidding I wasn’t hitting him.                 “Hey! Knock that off Tommy!”                 “My name’s Tom!”                 “Do you want me to tell your mom about this?” asked the big guy in the flight suit.                 “No Colonel.”                 “What’s wrong with you Tom? Hitting a boy like that? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, he’s half your size.”                 “He called my dad a bastard, Colonel.”                 “Why don’t you come with me Fred, I’ll get you cleaned up. You too Tom.” He wasn’t angry anymore even Fred noticed this. Fred was afraid he was in trouble now. I was glad he was afraid.                 We followed Colonel Henderson over to his house which was one of the bigger houses in Heaven’s Peak. His son was graduating this year and being that his son was pretty independent and no longer needed his help Colonel Henderson had been taking it on himself to watch after the neighborhood kids when their dads were gone. He had been busy.                 “Honey,” He called as he walked in and dropped his briefcase to the ground. “Could you get something cold to drink for Tommy and Fred?”                 “Alright.” She called from the kitchen where she was washing dishes from lunch. He went off into a room down the hall leaving the two of us to sit on his couch. Fred was careful to make sure that none of the blood running from his nose fell on the couch. We could hear the Colonel searching through the medicine closet.                 “Oh honey, watch it! This couch is brand new.” Said Mrs. Henderson as she put down the tray with three glasses full of ice and lemonade on the coffee table. The couch probably wasn’t brand new but the Henderson’s had this house where everything always looked brand new even their cars. She grabbed some paper towels and put them under his nose. “Hold these there, where is David?”                 Then Mr. Henderson appeared with some gauze, band aids and rubbing alcohol. “Alright Fred, what’s bleeding?”                 “My nose.” He said cheerfully. He was satisfied with all the attention he was getting. “Oh, well then, just keep those paper towels there and tip your head back.” He turned around to return all the things to his medicine closet seeming a little disappointed he didn’t get to use the stuff he had gone out and bought when they moved in and had rarely used since.                 “I’ll get you some Kleenex honey.” Said Mrs. Henderson a little dismayed with our dirty clothes from rolling in the grass.                 Mr. Henderson returned around the time Mrs. Henderson did. He thanked her and dismissed her back to the kitchen.                 “What was this all about?” He asked picking up his glass and inviting us to do likewise.                 “He called my dad a…”                 “Remember where you are Tommy.”                 “He called my dad a name.”                 “Why did you do that Fred?”                 “He said my dad was dead and my mom was a drunk.”                 “Oh, I see where this is coming from.” He looked pretty nervous. “If you want to Fred you can just finish up your drink and if you want to go outside and play.” No sooner had he said this then Fred got up thanked him and ran out the door presumably to go home.                 “Has your mother talked to you about your father’s status?”                 “What do you mean?”                 “You can go home but if you would please tell your mother that I would like to have a word with her.”                 “She’s at work now.”                 “When does she get home?”                 “At three.”                 “Tell her then.”                 “Alright.”                 “And Tommy, stay out of fights. I don’t want to see that again. What would your father say?”            “Yes sir. Thank you for the lemonade.” He nodded and I too was dismissed. So I walked outside. Fred had gone home he was no where to be seen. My house was just a block away but I couldn’t go home. It was locked my mom didn’t want me home alone. She was afraid of what I would do so I started walking up and down the street.    :This is the end of part one, I know it's kind of long but any feedback would be appreciated, I wrote this one a while ago, not my strongest but it's going to be my first, part two will come soon. The dialogue may be a little weak it used to be a problem of mine but I hope you like it:
