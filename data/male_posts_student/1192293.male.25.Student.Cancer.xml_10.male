Relevance  "The only issue the president is concerned with is the complete and total disarmament of Iraq and regime change in Iraq,"-Der Fleischer, White House Propaganda Secretary. What a big fuckin' surprise.  I'm becoming certain that our president has no answers for us on the real problems of this country, and instead has decided to create new ones of his own.  Meanwhile, I still have no health insurance, and my ass is beyond poor. What a gigantic schmuck.
