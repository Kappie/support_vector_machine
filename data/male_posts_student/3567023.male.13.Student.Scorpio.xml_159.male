There was an artical about how a senetor or someone of the sort failed to mention the Abu Graihb prison scandal to the graduating class at West Point Academy. ;) how the heck does the media do they. They find the bad in everything, its crazy. Whats the guy supposed to say? "I would like to remind you that some of our alumni have been torturing prisoners! So don't do it again." Its a freaking graduation ceremony not a place to remind us of wrong doings. He could have said that but what is the point. I think they are smart enough to relize not to do that. Thats the media and Card for ya!   http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-05-30-1.html
