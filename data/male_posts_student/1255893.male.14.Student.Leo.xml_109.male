I wish I woulda gotten more hugs though :( but Kelley (being the awesome person she is) let me borrow one after some guys basically threatened to stab me w/ a pencil .......... *cough*psycho*cough* Luv ya kelley! :-D Let's see, I got a new sn, even though it's on MSN ... still kewl. My dad got the chance to pick me up today! wo0t! We gave David and Jose a ride. Once we got home I found my widdle sis had a friend over, they were goin to barbie.com... soooooo boring, wtvr. I started to read people's blogs and noticed not too many people update daily ........... but what can I complain about ... neither do I! Anywho it's been an hour since i started to type out this blog ...... In that time I have showered and done some of my homework, I doubt I'll finish without Losing sleep. but wtvr. Better get used to it. I had this wierd idea to make a list of the people i wuv  .... but you guys should know who you are by now. If your not sure ask me, but you should know by now! I think Ima go now seeing as i still have a lots of crap to finish. L8R people!
