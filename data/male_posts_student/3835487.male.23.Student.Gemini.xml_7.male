It looks like it will be long gone by Monday, but you never know. The real loser in all this is Justin Landry who will be traveling to Florida on Saturday! In the words of Ryan, "I NEED THIS VACATION MAN." So hopefully, it will be long gone!  Congrats to Charlene, Rob's loving g/f, who got a new job! You should hook me up with some discounts on some sweet merchandise...or just give me the five finger discount. And Rob,  Andromeda Strain  is a really good book, I don't know what you're talking about. One post you say it's amazing, one post you say it's not that good...quit being a flip-flopper! And I still expect a new copy of  The Great Train Robbery . After nine years I'd almost forgotten, but now it's on. You don't screw with me and live to tell about it!!  Nothing else much going on here. A film recommendation...watch  The Last Picture Show . Yes, it is somewhat dated, but it is one of the AFI's best pictures of all-time, and with good reason. One of the best films I've seen in a long time, I can't believe I hadn't seen it before.  That's all for now...this is probably my last post before Florida, so perhaps I will come back with some debacle-esque stories. Crazy times!!!!!  Peace, Alex
