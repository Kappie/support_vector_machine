Im Glen, normal Singaporean guy, now in jjc, single, loves chess, pool, animes etc. Now having my June holidays... feel kinda bored and lonely, my gd fren S is leaving soon, so been spending some time with S, then other than tt, been going out occasionally with my old frens like K and D. Haven really bonded with my jc class, no best frens there, so been spending lots of time at home feeling lonely. poor me... my frens too bz for mi... lol  On the hind sight though, this isnt that bad i guess, watched lots of shows i always wanted to watch. Gundam wing, Kill Bill(v nice), Ice age, Band of brothers etc.  Also, recently got this online quiz thingie from a fren. got 2/10 sigh... so bad rite. then i sent one out too, turned out that fren was the only to pass mine... so guilty... haiz :) so must make it up to her somehow i guess, also gave her her bdae present 2 months late. SORRY!!!  Well, i guess ill stop here. To all my friends, stay happy always. cya!
