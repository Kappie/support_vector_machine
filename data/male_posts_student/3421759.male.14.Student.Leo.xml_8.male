I just saw the POA movie last night and I was very VERY dissapointed. I didn't think the movie was that good and I wanted to see if anyone else agreed with me or if i'm going crazy.   Now before you send me emails saying "YOU'RE ONE CRAZY FOOL!!!!"  I have written a list with all the reasons why I thought the movie just wasn't up to past standards.  THE LIST (DONT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE YET)  1. How about they started the movie with a mistake. "Luminos maxima".  The first thing we saw was Harry doing magic out of Hogwarts.  How about your about to be kicked out of Hogwarts to the maxima.  2.What was up with the talking shrunken head on the bus and why the heck didn't it shut up. I mean, if your looking for cheap laughs couldn't you find something less...creepy.  They were doing close-ups on the head and everything as if it was an integral part of the book.   How about you shut the stupid thing up and actually say something important.  3. That bald hunchback was supposed to be Tom the bartender.  You remember Tom? the gray haired guy from the first movie who was working behind the counter in the Leaky Cauldron and was in no way a bald hunchback?  4. The Hogwarts Express was so obviously not the one in the first two movies.  It was all dirty and cramped and the seats were plaid. Couldn't they find something a little similar to the train from before I mean seriously, that thing looked like a toilet  5. Since when was Gryffindor's and Slytherin's tables right next to each other.  Their backs were almost touching thats how close they were.  6. And since when could dementors fly?  They were flying around and hovering in the air as if JK Rowling wrote them like that.  It was as if someone took a scary looking balloon and covered it with an old black rag.  5. Where is Hogwarts again?  The last time I looked it wasn't surrounded by rivers, tiny islands and mountains.  It looked as if they put it in a whole other part of the country.   6.  How about you have to climb down a giant hill and a zillion steps just to get to Hagrids hut.  hmmm I seem to remember that it was just across the lawn.  But I guess when they moved the whole damn SCHOOL to another COUNTRY there was no lawn to place Hagrids HUT because everything was perched ON A FREAKING MOUNTAIN!!!  7.  Where is the whomping willow again in concordance to the school and did it just EAT A BIRD?!!!  Oh, you just go to the left of the Hogwarts school and fall 1000 feet down the  moutain it's perched on to your death.  Oh yeah, now I can see how Ron and Harry got to Hogwarts from being bashed in by the whomping willow in second year they're professional rock climbers and did it just EAT ANOTHER BIRD?!!!  8. Did you notice how they would just take strolls through the Dark Forest? oh its a nice day.  I think i'll take a stroll through the Dark Forest. I mean professor Remus is with me so nothing will attack me because he's a teacher and all the monsters will know that by looking at the professor robes he...never...wore.  9.  This is getting a number of its own. Lupin never wore robes of any kind through the whole damn movie.  EVER.  10. Oh My God, the quidditch scene.  Where to start? I'll start with the lightning.  Yeah, it's a good thing that wizards can't be electrocuted to death or there would be several dead students on Dumbledores hands.  I mean people were being set on fire and falling from the sky. Um can I redo that penalty shot because I was hit by lightening, fell from the sky, and broke my spine in five places.   Oh damn never mind, how could I not notice my broom was set on fire in the process? HAHAHA I guess im out of the game then.  11. the flying dementors were covered BUT, were the flying GRIMS? because that grim shaped cloud in the sky was actually a prophetic symbol. all the grims we saw were actually Sirius and not actual prophetic symbols of doom.  Something the director would know if he actually READ the book.  12.  um could you have made that moon anymore obvious?  maybe they wont realize its a moon, lets surround it with clouds and crap to make sure they know he's afraid of a full MOON.  13.  There are a few things that I never knew Hogwarts had that were introduced in this movie.  Like the Hogwarts choir, and the giant freaking Hogwarts clocktower!!  where did it come from?  why is it here? is it new? was it invisible before?  14.  ok im an african american myself so im not saying this to be offensive  but who the HELL was that fat black kid?  You know, the one that had all the lines but really shouldn't exist at all?  He was in Gryffindor too and in they're year! It boggles the mind!!! How about you cut him out and give those lines to an actual Harry Potter character  15. There is a similarity between Ron's character and Draco's.  They no longer have a back bone.  Ron's contant whining is very annoying, and so is Dracos exaggerated snivelling.  Oh no, Hermione and her evil fist, lets GO RUNNNNN!!!!!! "Your cat ate scabbers" "shut up Ron" "since I am now the coward sidekick and only here for cheap laughs I will obey your command"  16.  Whooo made the Maurauders map again? because if you didn't read the book you definitely wouldn't know because they didn't tell you. Sirius said "The map never LIES!!!" how the hell would you know that eh? it's not as if you helped MAKE the map or anything. they would have surely told us if you did.  17.  Oh My GOD!!! what are you doing in the shrieking shack?!!! Its the most severly haunted building in Hogsmeade!!! something will eat you!!! because noone told us otherwise in this movie. its not as if it could have gotten that name because something else was shreiking other than ghosts right? no school aged werewolves or anything.  18. Ginny only had one line in the whole movie and what was the point of her being in it at all? Hi Ginny "The Pink Lady was attacked!!" bye Ginny. How about they could've given that one line to someone much cuter lets say oohh Oliver Wood and it would have made more than half the audience much happier.  19.  Hermione.  You have such beautiful hair.  "Does my hair actually look like that in the back?" if you mean perfectly curled, cut and styled and not at all bushy then yes your hair does look like that.  20.  hey, did you know that a dementor can suck your soul out of your body without touching you at all? Is it just me or does that make their job seem a little too easy? It's a good thing I can push it into a box somewhere with my bright light that I learned how to create my second time trying.  The acting seemed a little...bad to me. except Daniel and Emma everyone seemed rushed except Lupin who seemd a little slow. I can't say anything about Rupert because I just didn't like his character in the past two movies.  Ron is not just some passive person that makes people laugh with his stupid comments.  Did this director even watch the first two movies?
