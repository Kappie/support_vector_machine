Had two miserable 'pao's for breakfast, watched nick play spiderman 2 for a while before i headed up back upstairs to play C Generals to fight for wateva cause the GLA are fighting for....er...played till about 1pm? Went downstairs to the kitchen to look at poor darrell trying his darnest to roll the dough nicely into an er, acceptable circular shape...BUT of course he miserably failed.....wahahaha. Thanks to his super built strong arms, he succeeded in making the pizza crust super thin, therefore unable to hold the pizza's toppings...some of the family blamed it on me because i did not spread enough cheese around the pizza but hey, at least the cheese HELD the pineapples and stuff TOGETHER! LOL wateva, anyway, was forced to do all the bloody dishes..yea, they happily splatter the spaghetti sauce all over their plates and i have to be the one who has to clean their shit up....wahahaha just kiddin guys....just havin fun bitchin about HOW BLOODY UNFAIR LIFE CAAAAAN BEEEEEEE.....BOOHOOOOO......lol lame.   Was on the last of the dishes when Sarah  Co. arrived, dont know why but it amused sarah and michelle when they saw me washin the dishes...*shrugs*   Oh well, had to convert the music scores to numbers much to yongxing's horror, as well, sarah, michelle and me were too used to looking at harmonica scores done taiwanese style...well that took quite a while to get the notes translated and then off we were practisin the song to a very, very confusing 3/4 beat..bad enough that we really couldnt get the beat, but to make things worse, yongxing's demostrations had him speeding like some mad cow on the loose...all thanks to the Allegro tempo indicated on the score sheet.  Managed to get the hang of the first two bars before sarah, michelle, yewon, larry and linsing groaned that they were starvin so they all happily took a break to go cook a huge pot of instant noodles...and guess who had to clean up? Haha nah sarah and michelle did most of the cleaning this time but er well, i only succeeded in failing TERRIBLY in trying to throw away the food scraps left in the sink...much to sarah's and michelle's amusement and LUCKILY mum didnt kick up a fuss at the mess i made...  Yea more training followed after that, our dear yeongsheng joined us later at around 5, yea he struggled too with the funny rhythem and the 3/4 timing. And being the bloody clown he so naturally is, he played around with the notes until he added more notes and voila, he played 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' and WAIT, it GOT BETTER, we all joined in and voila, out came the tune of HAPPY TREE FRIENDS!! LA LA LALALA........  After more training with yongxing on the piano, guys decided to order pizza delivery...goodness did they regret that later...Ls placed the order at around 7.10pm? And well, thanks to an 'apperently' busy day, the bloody brilliant pizza guys only reached at around 8.40pm...oh yea...and no cash rebate...oh well...as i always say, life's a bitch so no point bitching about life's unfairness eh? And oh man, before they started eating, my cousin nick had this bloody brilliant brain wave to come running up to me and telling me loudly that i had not bathed yet.......well done nick, nice that u brought up my personal hygeine affairs in front of a crowd of famished people...wat a great way to start a late dinner eh?   Well nothin significant happened after dinner...just the packing up and the usual walk to the bus stop to send the peeps off...er...came home and bathed...finished up wateva hw i had...will decide with the guys tomorrow about the FS hw we received in the mail...so yea, guess will stop here, nick snoring contentedly behind me...and yea gotta sleep too, class starts at nine tomorrow and oh YES, its Benson's bday tomorrow..well, since its 12 plus now, happy bday benson!! And its nice to hear the thunder rumblin in the background...looks like its gonna be a nice night to sleep.....oh yeeeeeea....later people.
