It started raining.  She finished cleaning and we went back to Burton.  We watched American Idol for awhile.. ugh.. that 2nd girl was gawd-awful.  I hope the first Hawaiian girl wins.  I agreed with Simon tonight.  I don't even watch this show and I have an opinion.  I collected a bunch of boxes from Cindy for my move this weekend (I have to pack Wednesday or Thursday) and headed home.  I started a load of laundry, started planning the dinner party with Jake, Laura, Luke, Cindy and I and chatted with Jake some.  He talked and talked and talked.. blah blah blah (I told him I'd write this).  He really didn't have anything interesting to say.  We talked about Rachael, his new place (He's living a full hour plus away from his job.  Rach is 5 minutes walking from her job) and a variety of other topics.  He just got back from a run and was soaking wet and tired.  He laid on the floor and put his legs up and started wriggling in pain.  Very weird.  We talked about the blog and how we now have a loyal fan base (hi Laura, hi Emily, hi the 35 other people that read this every day).  He did say something moderately funny (I miss Cindy and our funny quotes): Jake: I don't want to get out of these wet clothes... they're so cold. Luke: Uhhh.. that would be a perfect reason to get out of them. Jake: Not when I stand like this....  (see picture below)   urlLink     We're going to play some video games now.  My laundry is done.  Talk to you tomorrow.
