I know it sounds totally corny, but it's the whole truth. My friends are most likely one of the only things that keeps my world turning during the day. They know just what I like, what I feel, and what I need to hear when I need to hear it. Whe you stop and think about it, in an entire universe that doesn't know you even exist, a small group of people can change your life, soften your heart, and bring down the walls that surround it. The only thing better than having friends, is spending time with them. Any kind of time at all, is the best time you'll ever have, even if you don't realize it. Trust me, I used to overlook it all the time. But still, no matter what the world handed me, I had them, even when they didn't have me... It makes me very proud to know that love can be shared in the world of the physical, in the world of cyber space. We've come so far on our journey to obtain information as a race. Starting with nothing at all, we picked up the peices of what was right in front of us, and put it together. That fact alone, is breathtaking, and interesting. In a world of dull lights and empty hearts, one person can change your life for eternity, and beyond that. To think that something so delicate such as life, is actually controlled by one, flowing energy source which we all share, and we all connect with. Our will to love and survive, is that energy.....
