The real reason I felt inspired enough to write this blog is because of Grace. She's a friend of Chris and it seems whenever one of her friends meets a gay guy or lesbian they immediately say, "oh, you've gotta meet my friend Grace". Grace is kind of one of those people that you always wished were your older sister, the moment I met her I though "friend for life". I know it sounds stupid, but some things just come to you, you know it's right. Take Chris and I meeting for example, we both knew just about straight away that each other were gay. Chris really "loves" her and I think I'm on my way to "loving" her too.  Just another thing, the other day I bought a pack of twisties, after careful examination of the pack I found the words "life's pretty straight without..." I've yet to find a good end to that but I think with a little work we could make something quite cool. English involved a moderation test today, we had not a pop-quiz, but a pop-essay! We had to analyze a photo, I must say I really enjoy analyzing people and how they act but a one page essay is too much to ask :p  There are a few homophobic guys at our school, some worse than others. Jeremy is one of them. While practicing our cha-cha routine in lunch, Jeremy walked in to discover Kate and I zooming around the floor to really fast dace music. The expression on his face was one that deserved a photo and frame.  ~Paul
