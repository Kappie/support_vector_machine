Most of the time we are stuck in the swamp of the mundane or trivial. Although both have their importance’s in life, the essence of life is lost when we are trapped in that swamp. Right now in my life, my soul thirsts for new dreams and thirsts for tranquility. Foolishly I have sought that in others for many years, but the reality is, it is only in myself that I have any chance of finding it. But introspection is a deadly game that can lead one to becoming an introvert, insane or (the other side of the coin) one can blossom into what their soul truly wants to express which I imagine is fulfilling one’s dreams.  I have been a private person most of my life. Locking most of my thoughts between my two ears as I found few receptive to the questions I had and things I had to say. But between going insane with too many thoughts in my head and taking the chance on a lame blog; I opted for the latter. Eventually my sanity and search for peace has led me to this of all places. Why? The answer will only unfold over time. It brings a smile that I can share a part of myself that has been locked up for so long.   I have been debating whether to put my journal on the blog. Partly out of curiosity: to see the response of others, to see if others think like I do, and to release the maelstrom inside of me. I have written over a thousand pages in the last four years covering college, drugs, jail, death, adventure, and love and I am tired of burying all my emotions in my own soil. I almost think if I plant them on the Internet, they will grow. But into what, I do not know.  I have a feeling I will be writing often for sometime on this blog....
