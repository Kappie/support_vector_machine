")  Or maybe you'd like to try the  urlLink best toilet ever . This reminds me of some Japanese video I saw sometime ago where a couple went around naked in a big box made of the same type of glass, having sex while someone carried the box around the streets of the city. It was quite amusing.  Now can someone tell me why would anyone EVER want to keep Rasputin's penis in a jar? Or worse,  urlLink to exhibit it on a museum !? --- " Oh, Bob, could you chop his penis off for me? I wanna keep it in a jar with some neon lights on the side; it could do for a unique case-mod, and then eventually I can sell the penis on eBay, or to a museum. "
