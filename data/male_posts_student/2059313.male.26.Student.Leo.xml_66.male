I got an e-mail for a job that will last for about two weeks and pay pretty decently, and pay for a couple of trips I want to take next year.  I also got to spend a couple hours with some of the greatest people I've gotten to know in a while... some of the most genuine and suprising people I think I may've ever met.  I feel so much better about everything when I'm around them.  I don't feel like some pathetic person, I absolutely feel like I matter.  I don't feel as if I fell off the planet, no one would miss me, or wonder where I was.  I feel like I'm wanted and loved and special.  It's a lot like how I felt the first time I ever experienced that kind of feeling, when I met my friend Stephanie... except now it's multiplied and greater than ever.  Unfortunately, I had to ask a question, that I don't think I was quite prepared for the answer.  I will NOT let this get the best of me, I will NOT let this send me down some dark road where I may have traveled in the past.  I will NOT turn away from Christ as I'm drawing closer to him, and I will NOT let my friends, or myself down.  Friend, I need your help.  I may need to talk a lot about this.  I KNOW I will need Your help, God.  Please keep me from stumbling backwards.
