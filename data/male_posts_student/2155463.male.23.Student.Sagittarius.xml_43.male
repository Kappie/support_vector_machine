I never knew that it was such an involved process - of course, this is coming from someone who buys most of their clothes at Wal-Mart.  But come on - trying on 15 suits to find one that fits is a LITTLE much for me.  Of course, I am eternally grateful to her for it because I had to have one and the one I got actually fits, but still...I'm just not happy with the whole shopping experience.  And the way that she treated the clothes!  Oh man...she shoves me in a changing room and demands that I try on one of the dress shirts in the plastic wrickle-proof bags from the row with "Do not try these shirts on" emblazoned across the aisle.  Call me old fashioned, but if it says that I ain't trying it on (besides the fact that I hate putting those kinds of shirts on anyway) :P  And forget about shopping for jeans or pants with her...it would drive me crazy.  Oh how I long for my wonderful Wal-Mart - at least we didn't go to any malls, I swear I would have gone out of my mind!  Anyway...I think I want to become a workaholic.  Seriously - we've got an ISO audit coming up and I was at work until 7:00 on Monday and 9:00 last night (and I'm still her @ 2:45 today when everyone was free to leave @ 1:00) and I'm actually ENJOYING it.  And the audit is still two weeks away!  But working is better than sitting at home doing nothing (which is what I usually do at home), and besides, I'm getting paid for it.  And I just think that I like to work (which is a scary thought, even to myself) - nearly all of the happiest memories in my mind are somehow related to when I was working on something (the paper route in St. Marys, sports teams, yearbook, school projects, missions trips, etc.).  And likewise the worst memories are from times when I was aimless and not really doing anything, when I had too much "free time."  While I don't really look forward to working 80 hours or a week or anything, 60 ain't so bad now is it?
