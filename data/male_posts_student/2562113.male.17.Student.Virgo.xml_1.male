It's not the "Look, Kevin's getting pissed haha" type of pissed off, it's the type of pissed off where you want to put your fist through walls and scream at the top of your lungs.  My parents picked up my car from the mechanic earlier today while I was still sleeping. The mechanic was lucky I didn't come down there to pick it up, because the same two hands that are typing this blog would have been around his neck when he presented the bill. The bill, I care not to discuss, but the car is fixed and the mechanic can take the money, go on a cruise, and shove it up his ass.  I really don't know how much worse it can get. The whole winter break has been a nightmare so far. I'm starting to feel like I'm losing touch with some of my friends, and then on top of that this whole car bullshit happens. Albany, I miss you so much!!!  On a lighter note, happy new year to everyone!!! We can only hope for better luck in 2004.  -BIGsmut.
