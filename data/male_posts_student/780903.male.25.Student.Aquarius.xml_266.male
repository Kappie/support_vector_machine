This weekend will produce a motherlode of new material that will keep you laughing all week.  Trust me on this one.  And Thursday and Friday will have good stuff too.  If you're a loyal reader and have a preference between ramblings in paragraphs, sketches, or songs, shoot me an e-mail and it will motivate me to get cracking on some funny stuff.  I mean that.  Random thought as I was returning to my room today after a trip to CVS to buy a toilet plunger because the plumbing sucks and building services is slower than my digestive system is -- hard to disguise a plunger in a plastic bag.  There's simply nothing else it can be.
