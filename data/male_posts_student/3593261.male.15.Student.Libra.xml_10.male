I studied hard, all my focus when on those TYS but I didn't have the courage to face on. I have been waiting for this moment but...it looks like I was beaten to death by a bundle of anonymous competitors (the exam papers). It looks like a lesson learnt...or is it? Am I going to repeat the same mistakes last year? Can I achieve back my golden age? I guess this is a complex matter to handle. Friends of mine have told me to cheer up. Exams means a lot to me. Especially putting your heart and soul to what you are facing next time. I guess it has just got the best of me.     I must learn how to persevere. No matter how much I drop, I must stand. I can still remember Ms.Ang praised me...my tuition teacher praised me...the praises of my friends...it make me believe that I can do it..Even though O' LvL is near, I must not give up. I am planning to start a night class for my friends. It's probably a good idea for a wake up call. Maybe it's too late? Who knows?    Right now, I am listening to Egaoga Sukidakara ( Because I liked your smile ). It's the most beautiful and encouraging song I'd ever heard before. I must forge forward....no turning back..the past can't hold me back..I am Ismail..For my future...for my friends...for everyone... =)   I'll promise all of you 1 thing....I MUST DO WELL FOR O'LVL!
