I'll wave and blow you a kiss,   And say it's cool running into you like this.  How you doing, how many kids,   Do you ever look back,   And wish that you could turn,   Turn back time  And make me change my mind  But you didn't so, lets get on with letting go  Almost doesn't count you know  So remember
