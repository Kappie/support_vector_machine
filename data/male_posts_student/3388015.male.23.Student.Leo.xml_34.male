A little on the expensive side, though.  But the conversation is always the high point when eating with Emily. :)  Katie told us a new pick up line she heard about at the bar she works at:   A guy walks up to a girl at the bar.  Guy: My watch tells me things. Girl: Oh really? Guy: Yeah, it's telling me that you're not wearing any underwear. Girl: Whatever, I am too wearing underwear. Guy: (Shakes wrist, listens to watch.) Oh, that's right, it's an hour ahead.  I read an interesting  urlLink article  on male eating disorders, something that's always on my mind.  Obsessive exercise, low eating, bulemia, all important things to keep in perspective when trying to lose weight.  Researchers at the University of Central Florida released a study this month saying men who watched TV commercials of muscular actors felt unhappy about their own physiques. This "culture of muscularity" can be linked to eating disorders or steroid abuse, the researchers said.  Dr. Theodore Weltzin of Rogers Memorial Hospital in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, said one study showed 70 percent of high school males dieting.  It's amazing how hard it is to skirt the line of dieting and eating disorder.
