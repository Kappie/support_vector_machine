You probably don't realize this, but I'm fairly intelligent.  I've invested a lot of time in working on a thesis as an undergrad.  So trust me when I say that I know how to research and get pertinant information.  However, you and your demonic, shadowy step child "course administrator" have decided that the sources culled from Congressional Digest (readership just a smidge below People) are not infact 3 sources, but count as one.  This fucked up math has contributed to me waisting time and effort finding more jackoff articles about crack cocaine, which is cool in its own way, but when I would rather be focusing on more important things, I am  enslaved to your pointless exercise of source hunting.    Fuck off,   Jimmy
