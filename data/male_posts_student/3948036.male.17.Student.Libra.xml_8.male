They were bored and drove here, which is about a bit under an hour, but I seriously doubt that they followed the speed-limit. My friends said they were more familiar with New York and London than they were with Korgen. Now they can say it the other way around after my superb tour. "There's the local store. There's the local gas-station. Knock yourselves out." Okay, maybe I'm exagerating(is that how you write it? grammar not to well toonight;)) but it's nearly as bad as I make it out to be.  I went to my grandma and grandpa to mow their lawn this afternoon, and to see their kitten. The cat we gave them for x-mas had kittens a little time ago, and they got rid of everyone of them but one. And he's the cutest little thing! I know that it might seem a bit doubtful for me to call a kitten cute, seeing as I'm a seventeen year old teenage-boy. So let's just get one thing straight: I'm str, umm... heterosexual. And in addition to that, I think kittens are the cutest things to walk this planet. I wuv 'em.  urlLink Kittens!   Eek it's late, I gotta go to bed now.  Stand-Up Show of the Night:  Pablo Fransisco @ Comedy Central  HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA!
