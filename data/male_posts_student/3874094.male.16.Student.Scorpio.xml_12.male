Woke up at around 10 a.m, dragged my lazy ass all the way to ngee ann all for the sake to just upload my IMMF assignment onto the Np network.  Bah, should have known that majority of the stalls would be closed on a weekend, and I thought I could have a nice and cheap lunch in np....  Went down to yuhua with a rambling stomach, funnily I ran into michelle and larry at the np bus stop.Upon reaching yuhua, had the good fortune in meeting yewon who was just about to have lunch so yeap, settled lunch rather nicely...After that, it was harmonica practice again, yongxing being forced to do many solos..haha poor guy didnt really like all the attention he was getting..but hey, when you have the talent, its rather hard to escape when its been duly recognised right?   Felt a little sad that I couldn't join the band in breaking a Guiness record by participating in a 1000 strong harmonica band...had to go join the family cause mum bought tickets to go see The Revenge Of The Dim Sum Dollies, my goodness, after watching that stageplay, would wholeheartedly agree that I had no regrets.  Well before I start to elaborate more, just wanna add that I had dinner at SRC, which stands for Singapore Recreation Club, in case you guys don't know where SRC is, it shares the Padang with the Singapore Cricket Club..clear enough? Not eaten there in years.... well and then it was a nice 8 min stroll to the Esplanade.  Good lord, the play was absolutely fantastic! Poked fun at everything that had to do with affairs concerning Singapore. From the rivalry between the best girl schools in Singapore  ( They actually wore a rgs, scgs and chij uniform! ) and with all the female members in my family excluding my mum being scgs girls,  they were seriously tickled. Ah yea as I was saying, more stuff they joked about were like, the abuse of filipino maids, the imitation of singaporean's loathing of parking inspectors..you name it, it poked fun at ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING! And what was even more impressive, they managed to mimic various accents like the indonesian, japanese, filipino and malay accents to such an extent that I was like holy cow!  Bloody impressive play, daresay that the $250 that my parents forked out to watch the show was worth every damn cent.  Well thats it I guess, just had to blog about the Revenge Of The Dim Sum Dollies while it still lingered fresh in ma mind.  Oh yea, went down to Indochine at holland v to tell juwita that I couldn't make it to her engagement party as my harmonica concert unfortunately fell on the same day...bugger... Well when you are in a bar like Indochine, its kinda hard to resist the temptation to drink, especially when you are friends with the staff yea? Lol, drank vodka cranberry with a dash of soda, while my sister drank grenadine with coke. So happy, its been a long time since i last drank decent vodka, and vodka being almost odourless, mum wont find out...ssssh!  Kinda sad that while I am blogging this,  as the rest of the harmonica graduates are now staying overnight in yuhua...having a blast I guess.....  Guess thats all, feeling sleepy.....and the fact that Smackers are having a jamming session at 9 tomorrow, well, lets just say I will be late as usual...wahahahaha.  Not Funny.   Later people.
