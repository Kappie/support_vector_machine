If you have ever been on the west coast of the US, you will find that many of the people actually SIDE WITH THE TERRORISTS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?????? If I came up to someone, and punched them in the face, would they blame themselves? NO! They would punch me right back! You know there are SERIOUS problems with a society when they feel that they are to blame for EVERY LITTLE THING! 2 1/2 years ago, we had a 2 planes fly into the World Trade Center...killing 3000+ people, and now, all we can think about is a few "Tortured" Iraqi soldiers? As I recall, those who died in the Trade Center were not exactly beligerant...they were TRADING. but let's not even mention the men and women in the towers, crying out in vain as fire consumes them, or those who jumped out from 80+ stories onto the pavement to escape such a fate... let's talk about 3 ENEMY SOLDIERS who were "discrased"...and ofcourse they were never planning to bomb our military bases in Iraq, never ever ever ever trying to KILL our troops...My thinking is, if you are going to attempt to attack those who are liberating you, then you had better be ready to face the consequences. Let my rant be a lesson to society... for many of the ills in the world, we are not to blame. We are the ones who prevent the ills of the world...or at the least TRY to.           *cough*France,Germany*cough* Grrr...
