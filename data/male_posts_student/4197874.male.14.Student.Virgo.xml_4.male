It's really short and stupid and i wish i could have left it the way it was. u.u;; But i guess i will just have to deal with it I would have been sent home from school or something if they saw it how it was. XP I am pretty well through the first book i have to read and i can get one of them on tape which shouldn't be bad at all. *sigh* but there is always that third book @__@ i guess i will just have to get as much of it done as i can and maybe my mom and dad will still get me that tablet >.>... Well as a reward of getting my hair cut i get a hat from Genki Gang and i am kinda happy for that ^_^ i was really wanting one so i guess it pays off XD and it will grow back i guess :\ On Gaia today i really didn't go on a whole lot but my friend started a lotto and i will be there bumping sometimes but i will still be in the charities of course and also i got two friend list requests from people i don't even know and then a PM from one of them wanting money : i hate beggers. XP Well... i have registration for school tomorrow and i am going in the afternoon i guess so i have to get up u.u;; oh well i have to get in the pattern of getting up for school so it kinda helps me out. ^_^ ... well i have nothing else to say now... *blinks* yeah.... >.>
