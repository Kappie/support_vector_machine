I'm leaving tomorrow (well technically today) for Mississippi, and Claire is leaving on Saturday for New York.  We were planning on hanging out tonight, but her parents wouldn't let her come over... so that blows.  Good thing phones were invented (props to ya, Bell).  Well Jesse came over tonight, and we kinda sat around, played guitar and stuff, then played PS2 and computer and stuff.  Then he had to go home.  Wednesday night Ben, Edward, Dabney, and I were at Claire's house and we were going to have a bonfire but Mother Nature had different plans for us.  So we made a fire in her charcoal grill, and we roasted marshmallows on it.  Then we went to Wrights Mill, and Ben was being his normal pyro self, and lit a trashcan on fire, which eventually melted through, so we dumped it in a puddle so it wouldn't burn down the school.  We went back to Claire's house and Edward, Dabney, and Thomas had to go. Claire, Ben, and I played Timesplitters until like, 11:20.  On the ride home, my dad called me and told me I was late getting home... so I get home and he gets mad at me for being 40 minutes late, which I guess is understandable, but whatever.  So yeah... looks like this month will be pretty sucky! Everyone seems to be going places.  If you are going somewhere, I hope you have a great time! I'm glad you get to get away from Auburn, you lucky bastard! Haha, well, see ya whoever is reading this.
