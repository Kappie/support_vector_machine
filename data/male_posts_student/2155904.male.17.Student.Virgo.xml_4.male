On the Tuesdays to end all Tuesdays, Tyke, Skippy, and Tyronius had a splendid birthday bash for Skippy's 18th.  It was awesome.  Playboy=Hot chicks.  AAR=Huge (pronounced hooge) bazoomas on display.  And wow, these puppies were succulent and Tyke even remarked that they were "the best set i have seen next to Purdy's purdy pair."  On whimsical Wednesday, Skippy and Tyke were extremely hungover from their escapades but managed to trudge through the day with a smile on their face.  Tyke and Dottie Hottie had their usual snugglefest in the worst class EVARRR!!!! (english with Mrs. Dyke-Bitch).  Dottie is such a hottie.  How can you not love her.  Skippy got his magnificent present from Purdy McHot and was pleased to say the least.  Some toys for the bedroom is what they will be used for.  Wink wink.  Wink wink wink.  Wait, what?  Wink.  Then the three went back to Purdy's and watched Friends.  Wait, that was a different day.  Nope same thing.  Then Mandy Moneymaker joined up with them and they went back to Skippy's house for a love fest.  Good times.  This day ended as most days do.  With a love fest.
