People who can speak to me English fluently... people who can joke around without hurting other people's feelings... People who do not suan much... haha......  I think I'm self-offically a Campus Crusade member... lolz.... The people there are nicer then I thought and I can freely talk whatever I want to them... Cool bunch, all of them... The lectures I went to so far are super cool.. maybe with an exception of a few.. like I.C. PIG...  The lecturers try to be nice and make their lectures as interesting as possible.. but.. some of them juz dont get it.. haha...  Sarah, Sonia, Jason, Timothy and me are in one group... So cool... we were like binded together since the first day of school...  Yaaay.. juz got Office XP from Timothy today... hengz siah.. or else I dono how I'm goign to do my DRN assignment...   Lolz.. juz played a game of Gunbound with my Jason... Dono what made me use Aduka.. haha... I lost terribly... hope he didnt mistake me for trying to undermine his skills or something...  Recently I've been reading this book called Angels and Demons... From the same author as the DaVinci Code... Intriguing... this book... Stretches your sci-fi imagination and wraps up your factualy world....  Yawnz.. zeepy..
