LoL)...tonight was just "off da' hook" if you'll pardon my ghetto lingo. first off, i found out that daniel scott my buddy was home for a few hours, just b/c he had the day off of camp, and so i was talking to him online for a few minutes--i also got an instant message from ray, and then from tim...and tim said: dude, you just TOTALLY blew off ray! LoL. so, i was talking to ray online after daniel said that he needed to "rest"...i didnt believe that it was him, b/c it sounded like tim (oh well--guess ray isnt noah 2...he must be tim 2 MWAHAHA! LoL). soo i was like: if this really is ray, then call me. so, he called me and i was like: you niggers! LoL sooo daniel and ray decided to totally like come over and "beat me up"...but being me, they just love me so much, i knew they were coming over JUST to say hi b/c they love me! when they got here, we talked for like 30 minutes under my gazebo, and had a GREAT time...so many good jokes. as Daniel would say, after our CV revenge TPing scandal..."You've just opened up Pandora's Box Noah"...i was like: "Sorry daniel--but we CLOSED it!" haha...they stayed for a little while longer, talked with my mom, then daniel asked me for some scissors to cut his ghetto car cieling cloth...LoL ray was laughing so hard, b/c he knew i was thinking: wow--JANKIFIED BEYOND. they left, and my 3 sisters laura, sara, and katy all came to pick me up to see "The Village". i got in the car, and said hi to katy's friend brittany--who i actually thought was katy LoL! "It's katy with a nose job, guys!!"...Katy: "That's hot...so hot." LoL good stuff you guys. we got to the movie theatre, i saw some of my old buddies from school (Jessica Fernandes, Beckie Alcantara, etc). btw, congrats to Jessi for getting back together with Daniel Marino..good stuff i guess! sooo we sat through the movie, and laughed at all the scary parts. at one point, a fly flew next to my ear, and i jumped so high! LoL! then, i was getting ready to talk to laura about something, the girl fell into a ditch, and she screamed right in my ear! haha...Adrian Broday (Noah was his name in the movie--great) was the best person. he was like mentally challenged, and he was laughing at all the scary parts--we agreed that he was Silas, for sure. LoL! by the end of the movie, we spent 10 minutes trying to explain the ending to Brittany, b/c she STILL didnt get it. we walked outside and waited for mom (Windy Chite LoL), and still were trying to explain the ending to brittany LoL! we drove brittany home, but of course mrs white cant end the night without a few "great" jokes...so she goes: hey, if you read books, we could call you "Brit-Lit"...and if you played baseball, we could call you "Brit-Mit"....we just stared in awe at the "genius" of it all LoL! laura was just like kept backing up when she made a U-turn, and it was great. so, we finally get to my house, and mom asks me if we had the Lord of the Rings movies, and i told her that we had all of them. so, i went inside to get them, and sara kept saying: yeah? well mine are fullscreen AND the full version!....laura goes: she was talking to NOAH...and i was like: yeah, SARA...guess i must have grew my hair out and started dressing worse! LoL! it was terrible, but so great. soo we were all in the car (katy, sara, mom, and laura) just talking for like 30 minutes...  Mrs. White: lets all do our gollum impressions!! dude, omg--the greatest LoL!! it was sooo terrible, but so great. mom definitely had the best one down for sure! wow..just so many great times tonight, i cant even remember all of them. katy: "we're not laughing AT you...we're laughing NEXT to you!"....Me: "wow katy--only God's laughing"....LoL! mom kept on grabbing laura's hair and sticking it up her hair and saying: "see guys? its laura's nose hair!" LoL seriously, none of us there could have past the straight line test (for drinking), b/c we were just all woosy LoL! good stuff. well, i cant remember a lot of stuff, except for weird noises and Gollum impression, and sara talking about how HOT Mr.White is (yeah...noah, did you know sara smells his underwear? LoL) laura, that was great...well love you guys, and cant wait to make MORE memories...one of the best times i've had all summer. and yes, mom...i WILL cherish it FOREVER! byebye!
