I think I mortally wounded it, though. I reminisce of a time with a fellow of mine. We spotted another of the damn filthy piece of you-know-what. Hit it five times with a shoe. Nike, in fact. But it still didn't die. Damn those immortal things. Had to flush it.  PSAT workshop meeting was this morn. 'twas the last one. Now we have the real thing, next week. I have the terrible fear that I shall perish.  Sibling's annoying little fiend (I...forgot...to...type the r. Oh well) is over here again. Absolutely hell in a shell.  OPEC paper now, but Monday, we're out. Thank god. But Dad's making me go to Rhodes, for a comparison college. I shall escape the state for college, but it is always good to have a back-up plan.
