I hate that it takes forever to restore Windows, the drivers, and crucial applications.  I am trying out  urlLink Acronis True Image 7.0  which will make an image of my hard drive as I want it.  Then when things get really messed up I do not have to sit around all day to format, put drivers on, ect.  Now I can boot from the rescue media and restore my hard drive image from CD, DVD, Zip and more!  Now I have not done this yet but I will be testing the restore soon after I format.  It should take much less time than it does to install windows and all of the components.  I would suggest taking a look at this ingenious piece of software!
