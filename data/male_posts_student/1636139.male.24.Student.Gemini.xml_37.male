It has a sun-roof  heated leather seats, among other things. We took it for a spin  have decided that it is much nicer than the Alera. 
  
While we were at Hertz, however, we found out that they had been charging Sun $5.50/day for property theft insurance that Kirill had not asked for  was quite unaware of. Considering that we never leave anything remotely valuable in the car, this was basically about $300 down the tube because the Hertz employee that gave Kirill the car in SFO had pulled a sneaky trick.
