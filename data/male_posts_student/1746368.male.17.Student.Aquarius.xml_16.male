For those of you who have been in my kitchen, which isn't very many of you, my mom's desk, the tall white cabinet and the little desk with the scanner are all gone. They are now replaced by two beautiful brown pieces. One of them is a hutch that is really good looking, and the other is a sideboard. In my parents room, they replaced my dad's dresser with another dresser and pretty soon we are going to replace the kitchen table with a different one (even though we just replaced this one). We are getting all this furniture for free, so it doesn't really matter.   I read a little more in the 5th book of the Alvin the Maker series. The 5th book is called Heartfire and I'm not even halfway through it. I would like to finish that book sometime soon.   I'm playing  urlLink Scrabble  online right now. Although my opponent and I both got disconnected I am going to wait for he/she. The game is very fun, and it plays very well. The person just left the game. Oh well, I'm starting a new game now. I will be back to complete this journal in a minute.  *a minute*  Well, I think I'm getting bored of this game. I am going to play sorry once Dominique comes home (hopefully). I probably need to move back to my computer so she knows I'm actually here (I'm on my parents computer right now). I wonder how long I can make this entry. I don't know how much more I can stand of the computer I'm using. It's keyboard is less used then mine.  Much better, now I'm my own computer, without a wire. I have a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse, and it's really nice. I can type with the board on my lap. Nobody is really online right now, except Dominique, but she is away. I am so bored everyone.  urlLink E-Mail  me some interesting web-sites. I need something to during the day.   Today I finished the other Calvin  Hobbes book and now I have no more Calvin to read. I love Calvin  Hobbes. I still haven't changed out of my pajamas from last night. Summer is great, especially when I can do that. I need to find something to do. People have been telling me I don't get outside often enough, but I need some suggestions to do while I'm outside. "Walk your dog" is the only one I've gotten.  Well, that's pretty much all I have going on in my mind. Nothing is swirling around in there. Although usually, for nothing to be swirling around, something had to be in there to begin with. Oh well. Remember: To make a bad day worse, spend it wishing on the impossible.--Calvin
