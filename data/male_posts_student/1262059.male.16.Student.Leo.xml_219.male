Haruka's strange silver eyes searched the buildings for a inn. Her short-cutt, raven coloured hair strung damply in circlets, resembling serpents. Tugging her male kimono, that was black and navy blue, closer to herself, Haruka looked over to Hinotama who was hopping along close behind.  Hinotama refused to hide that fact that she was female, although she wore male clothing that flurished with autum colouring, making many believe she was in fact just a beautiful boy. Her bright brown eyes searched the streets with curiousity, a smile firmly etched on her pale skin, where as Haruka had a darker tone.  Hinotama held a red fan in her right hand, that she kept on using to point at certain things she found intruiging and her long dark brown hair moved freely in the Night wind.   "Calm down," Haruka said with her stiff, cold voice, "you'll attract the attention of the whole neighbourhood." Hinotama held the fan up to cover her face and wide wide, shiney eyes. "Oh, I'm sorry!" A hint of mishchieviousness sparkled in her eyes.   Haruka sighed as she glanced at all the watchful eyes which peeked through windows, alley ways, and passery byers. The streets were oddly lively for such late hours. A blue Moon glistened in the sky, which was unlucky for Haruka, as it would be much more difficult to complete her task. Her eyes caught onto a large inn that seemed suited for the wealthy, but instead of entering, she turned and spotted a little one near by and motioned Hinotama towards it.   Hinotama peeked out the window of their little room. It was rather small, but none the less the Night air was welcomed. As people stared up at her, she would smile and wave at them. Often they would turn quickly and leave, making her frown.  Haruka sat on the floor with her legs crossed and one hand supporting her chin.  Hintotama waggled her legs as she crouched near the window and whined, "I'm bored, Haru-chan."   Haruka replied, "I told you, do not call me that. And we cannot do anything right now as the Moon is full."  Hinotama snapped her fingers and stared wide eyed at her compainion. "You know, Haru-chan, I just thought something."  She sighed and switched arms, asking, "What is it?"   Hinotama pouted and looked up as if thinking. "What shall we use,"-she held out her arms to show she held nothing-"if we have nothing with us?"  Haruka couldn't help but slightly drop her mouth open, as a certain anxiety took over her. "You are unprepared??"   Blinking, Hinotama asked, "Was I supposed to bring something?"  Just then the hair on Haruka's neck went up and a feeling surged through her. "Dammit, you've practically invited them over."  Hinotama's eyes suddenly lost all light, and a smile that resmbled that of a crazzed man's marked her once light-hearted grin. Her voice was deep and confident. "We'll have to make sure they have a good time, now wont we," she said, as they faded into the darkness.
