And this to thee I doth bequeath..."  His blood had gushed onto the floor  'Twas not enough, I thirst for more  Ohwhat a shame,thine soul torment  Perchance I could speed its descent?  "And with this tiny candle fire  I shall be quenched frommy desire  Mine sympathy you'd not return  Then all shall die and all shall burn!"  I watched the halls engulfed in flame  My conscience hath remained the same  Through all of this I smile somehow  "It all ends here, it all ends now...  Do you disdain? None shall remain!  Fear me now!I aminsane!  AHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!"  ------------------------------  I'm in another one of those "I-don't-see-the-purpose-in-not-comitting-suicide" moods again, which you will no doubt dismiss as just some fleeting thing that will be completely gone in the next few days. You know what? You're probably right. Pardon my lunacy.    completely wrong thought of the day:  "Each man I killed and edifice razed  Is but a taste of my trail blazed Your sanctuary does not exist Embrace the pain or... HOLY SHIT PALAKA!"  You probably don't know this (why would you?), but I am deathly afraid of frogs and toads. Yes I am, don't argue. I remember back in Laguna when that subject came up while me, Mako and Jam were roaming the grounds. Our conversation went something like this...  Mako: Wala kayang palaka dito? me: Ha?! Bakit naman??!? Uy walang ganyanan, takot kaya ako sa palaka! Mako: Ako rin naman eh. Nung isang umaga nakakita nga ako doon o... me: Oh shit! Ok lang, andyan naman si Camille eh! Mako: Honga! Andyan naman si Camille!  Some of the dialogue might have been altered. A little help, Jam? ;) For the record, Mako is like, I dunno, 5'10" and kinda looks like a tough guy, if only just a touch. Oh, and Jam and I got the idea to tell him to join the next season of SCQ... but that's another story.
