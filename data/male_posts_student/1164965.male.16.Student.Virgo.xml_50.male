That's actually a great idea actually of setting up a ground rule for everybody to speak, except that I'm not that kind of person who wants to jumpstart forcing other people to speak. But it would be nice for everybody in our class to finally break the "shyness" barrior.......after almost a whole year has gone by.  So for all you, please just start randomly question "Underrepresented" people "what do you think of this", or "what's your opinion on this issue".  I'm SURE everyone has great ideas to share, the "laziness", "uncertainty", and "shyness" are the only barriors.   In other news, third period would really like to know what was the highest grade on the English AP practice test multiple choice section in first period? Somehow almost every member of third period has a feeling that first period is "smarter" and engages in better discussions that us.   Don't be shy to share your comments now :)  Thomas Chen
