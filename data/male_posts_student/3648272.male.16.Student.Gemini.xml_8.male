So lemme just recap on the events that took place after my last post.   I went to the Poconos like 2 weeks ago. Had a good time. I played bball, pool, ping pong. I also went water skiing. I actually stood up for longer than 10 seconds on the skiis. I really have to say that water skiing is like 20000x harder than regular skiing. I spent the 4th of July weekend up there. I went out on the boat and saw them shoot off the fire works. My friends and I shot off some fireworks too but ours weren’t that great. In fact, we almost hit a few people with our fire works. As for fishing, I normally enjoy fishing but it wasn’t so great that weekend. I woke up at 6 AM to go fishing and I only caught like 3 fish…waste of time. I also managed to get sun burn, although it didn’t hurt a lot.   After the 4th of July weekend things went downhill. CSI offered me a scholarship to take one college course over the summer for the month of July. I decided to take it because it was free college credits. I actually took the math course… Math 113 Introduction to statistics and probability with computer applications or some B.S. like that. The class lasts 4 weeks, 15 sessions, Monday-Thursday, 3.5 hours per session (the first week we only had 3 sessions…Tuesday-Thursday). Although the material covered in class, isn’t insanely difficult, the class isn’t that easy. Since we only have 15 sessions, we have to squeeze in an ENTIRE course in those 15 sessions. So out of those 15 times, I have 4 tests and a final + a shit load of homework….like 60 problems a night minimum. It’s pure hell. At least I’m halfway done (I only have 8 sessions left). In addition to this crappy math class, I also started an SAT (verbal) class. This class isn’t as bad. It’s only once a week for 1.5 hours. Unfortunately the teacher makes sure I come home with 5 hours of homework + 1 test a week. It’s not as bad as it sounds; it’s just a pain in the ass because I’m taking it in conjunction with the math.   Aside from school, my gym/diet routine is getting more different every week. My gym routine is pretty much the same with a few minor changes. Now I’m starting weightlifting for the legs (calves, hamstrings, quads..etc). Also my morning cardio won’t always be on the treadmill + bike. Now I actually go outside and do a real jog for 30 mins. As for my diet, I’ve been reading may routines and articles, so I’ve upped my caloric intake to 1500 a day (previously it was 1200). 1200 is pretty much starvation, especially when I am very active and I’m afraid it will eat away my muscle tissue, not to mention slow down my metabolism. I’m probably going to stick to 1500 calories for 6 meals a day (each meal being 250 calories) for 4 days a week, the remaining 3, I will crank it down to 1000 calories a day and then switch up to 1500 the following 4 days. I’ll be doing this type of caloric cycling for a while to see if it works. I might even post up my progress log for the coming weeks. I’m going to stick to this routine for about 3-4 weeks. If I don’t see progress, I’ll flush it down the toilet and start with a new routine.
