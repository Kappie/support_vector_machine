Stephanie (fellow band nerd) also came... because it is boring to go anywhere with only yourself. Having the usual connections, we managed to acquire a 'special pass' and were able to park on Pearson Airfield... right in front of the hangars. This is as close as you can get to the action. The show was certainly better than recent years, despite the funding issues.
