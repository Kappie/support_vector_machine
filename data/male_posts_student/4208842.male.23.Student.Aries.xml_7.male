Just watch it and I guarantee you will walk away with at least one line stuck in your head.   "Hey, man. Nice marmot."  "Smokey, This is not 'Nam. This is bowling; there are rules here."  "...Also, Dude, 'chinaman' is not the preferred nomenclature. 'Asian-American', please."  "This is what happens, Larry! This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS!!"   The list goes on... feel free to add your favorites after you have experienced the film, first hand.
