Finally we ended up in Massechusettes and you showed me your old neighbor hood and we you lived and all your friends back there. Then it was time to go home, so we got in the car and drove off, but i woke up before we got home. The car ride back was great though. We spent the whole ride talking about your childhood and mine. It was excellent.  I love you
