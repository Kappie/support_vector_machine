If you want to know more about a Panda, the picture comes to mind is foul-mouthed, erutating bunch of highly respected people, who has the sole right to worship GOD for us in temples. But, for me, Panda is a depiction of lot of junk and not-so-very-junk stuffs arrangedon a platformin a very confusing manner. He will be very raucous in words, but yet at times he would be very parsimonious in speech. Sometimes, he would make you drink till you feel like chopping off your headimagining how the next morning is going to be for you; and sometimes, he would initially coax you and then congratulate you for your teetotalism. Sometimes, he will say its sex and sometimes he would say it spiritualism. He would confuse you and then would take you out of the cloud to show you the clear world, which lies beyond everyone's imagination. He would encourage you to conquer the world, and sometimes would show you the pleasure in losing some battles in life. He is someone you would do anything for. He is someone about whom you would like to talk with  urlLink Vineet  and  urlLink Vikram , the guys who have seen him as closely as me.   And if you have an elder bro like him, you are exactly going to feel the way I do. He helped me a lot, always going out of the way. Thanks Panda, for everythign you did for me as a bro and as a friend.    PS: His blog is not activated till now, but will be very soon.
