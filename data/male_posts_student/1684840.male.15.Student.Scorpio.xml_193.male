I'm sitting right by the swimming pool at the moment and Dan, Ryan and Grandad have just jumped in and are splashing around with a few other French people who are among them having a splash. Today has been okay so far. I woke up about 7:30 French time (which is a bit silly because France falls on the GMT time zone!) and went to the toilet... nice!  I went back to sleep for about an hour and was then woke up by the Grand'uns for breakfast. I wasn't really hungry to be honest, or I was just not in the mood for French food. I grabbed a bowl of museli and some jam on toast and got stuck in. After breakfast we left the restraunt (in a bit of a mess hehe) and went to the hotel rooms to decide what to do. We ended up going to Cité Europe, the massive mall which is full of shops that we've never heard of before lol. Daniel and Ryan bought these American tops with their 30 Euros, with an added injection of cash from Grandad of course! I haven’t spent a 'cent' on French soil yet...  We came back after careering around the shop bit at the end to get Dad some wine and stuff. Bored and a bit hot, we stayed in the hotel room for a short while and then made our way down to then pool about 3:00pm. It said it was closed so we waited around the lounge area until it opened.  So here I am beside the pool, writing this blog entry for the second day... in France! I will add a bit later after we've done some more worth blogging lol. Au Revoir! Back! Right then...  After the pool we went back up to the hotel room to drop things off/collect some things, and then we made our way into Calais town centre for a bite to eat. We found the 'English Spoken' London Bridge Pub where we had dinner. I ordered a massive pizza with a fried egg in the middle lol. I could only eat about half of it before I was really full up. A fayre was being installed beside where we were sitting which Ryan took an interest in, plus a gigantic plush Pikachu stuffed toy hanging inside one of the booths.  After we had dessert (I had a really nice raspberry sorbet with strawberry ice-cream) we went in the car to the beach, just as P Pride of Kent was arriving in port. There were about six ice-cream vans parked along the promenade. Well, when I say vans... They would be better described as ice-cream trucks! We walked past them anyway (Ryan wanted one after just having one for pudding) and walked along the pier, stretching along the dirty Calais water. Numberous boats could be seen across the horizon in great sunlight, which I couldn't capture on film due to me not bringing my camera out with me - doh!  The seaguls were playing silly buggers and running away from the waves which came in on the beach. Ryan kept going "Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!" lmao. We made our way back to the hotel, and just as we were about to go around a round-a-bout before the hotel, HUNDREDS of cyclists appeared out of nowhere! I have preciously complimented France on the amount of cyclists, but I didn't expect there to be this many, and taking up the whole road wasn't exactly funny either, well - Hehe! We followed them into the hotel and everything. It turns out they were all English and staying here overnight. All of them had cycled from London earlier today and had arrived here this afternoon! Tomorrow they are heading off early to begin their journey to Paris by bike. They seemed like a really friendly bunch anyway, I was with a few in the lift for about 40 seconds and they didn't even try and see if I was French, they just said "Going up?" lol :-)  So here I am in bed at 00:42 French time, being naughty on the laptop when I should be getting to sleep lol. I've just had a shower and it's not that bad here. I discovered that a flashing light over the townscape view out of the window is the lighthouse at the harbour! I want to go there again tomorrow so that I can capture a lovely sunset in the ocean, if it is a nice clear day as was today.
