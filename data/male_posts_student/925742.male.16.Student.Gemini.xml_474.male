Thats really really sappy and dumb, but shut up, this is my blog.    Charlie pissed me off today, which is no surprise, I treat them as I do all my friends, but Charles had to borrow my phone and didn't even tell me who they were calling.  Its my goddamned phone, Victor!  Hahaha.  I dissected a worm today! Yeah, it was crazy fun, I like biology.  I need to work on my Law and Legal stuff.
