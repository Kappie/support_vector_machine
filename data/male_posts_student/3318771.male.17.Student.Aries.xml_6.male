Played a match for a friend today and lost 5-3, scored 2 goals. Its funny, on the right wing, I couldn't make such an effect but in the 2nd half, when I was switched to the left, I had 3 shots, all on target and 2 were goals. The 3rd shot was somehow saved by the keeper.   I wanna talk about "calling one's own". I have noticed so many people using their signature to own what is not theirs. In other words, they get this picture, open it in an Image Editing Program and puts their site as the owner of this picture. I find it very despicable because in the first place, they did not ask for permission for the usage of the original picture and that is wrong. By doing this, you are not giving credit to the original host of the picture.   They might give the excuse that the picture is on the net so its entitled to be downloaded by everyone. What do you think? Is that the real reason? I leave it to you guys to ponder.
