Work was unproductive. I just chatted with Julia the whole time. Only 2 more days of work left!  I woke up obscenely early today. Before 9! I guess that's what happens when you go to bed around 10 the night before. I don't think I've gone to bed that early in years.  Things to do today... go to the bank, look for more Scott Hall figures, go to Frys to check out laptops.  In rotation right now is some Diesel Boy.  ***
