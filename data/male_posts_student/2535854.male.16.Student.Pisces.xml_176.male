So yesterday assembly took quite some time as some special guests were arriving to and awarded Cempaka with some award for having the best Interact club in the country>Or at least of out 130 + schools I think...I didnt even know the schools interact club does any shit man!Weird..very..how did they win?Was the vote rigged?I talked to Cheryl and Jiv (rajiv) about it...I said it was weird...cause I go for these kinda things BUT I dont officially join these clubs or be any part of em..I just claim to be part of em..give my short name or schools initials and slip away...I honestly say Assunta is good at this kinda stuff I suppose...and Rotary club of Pantai claims to sponsor..reminds me of CHS and them unable to get a sponsor and was helping them for like hours and hours or all day at Mid Valley helping em out..strange ppl...  anyway school was a waste of time pretty much..learned next to nothing cause Mr Lee didnt come so no maths and had 2 periods worth of maths..bm wiped out by assembyl..english boring with a ton of ppl being bushwhacked including me...  So Cheryls trying to get me to sing for Wizard of Oz for commencements I think..their short of singers I think..I suck at singing..my voice is like unpredictable and doesnt co-operate very much most of the time and it has mood swings :P :P :P!!!!But I guess ill give it a shot?Why not?I`m sure ill get lessons!And they should make my singing good enough so I dont get sued for making everyone deaf or causing major ear damage to everyone..or spend less money on ear-plugs or less thicker ones :P :P.Lmao.I tink i`ll give it a shot!Just gotta attend every rehersal though..miss 1 and ur ass is kicked outta town!Some Cheras guys got it...and also...theres no solos so im not worried so much :D .
