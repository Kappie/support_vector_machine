The game started at 7:00, and at 7:05 they wouldn't let anyone else into the game. It was pretty gay. I thought it was dumb. But hey, it is CCSD. LOL. Talk about ghetto. Anywayz. So at half-time I got into the game. The white ccsd police officer let me in. I guess he felt sorry for me or something. So I enjoyed the rest of the game. Rancho lost, but I had fun. Then we (parental units and myself) went to In-n-Out. Guess who I saw? CHAD! I hadn't seen him in forever. He was too busy working, but he is still oh-so-hot. But yea. Then I went home and showered and went to bed. Dreamt about Sean, but that is another story.  Then I woke up on Saturday and messed around on the computer. I invited Michaela to the show at Smoothie King, so we went Saturday night. I had a blast. I'm beginning to like her. Shocking, I know, being that I'm GAY. But moving on....We saw Ann the Man and Natalie there. They are soo cool! So we guawked over guys and listened to bands, and discussed gay guys at school. Then I took Michaela home and went to bed. And had yet another dream about Sean.  Then I woke up today and just got online, and watched my dad's fantasy football team get its ass kicked. Needless to say, we lost. LOL. Then I watched the Bronco - Vikings game. We lost. :'( It is a sad day. Oh well. Then I got called ugly by Tim and Tyler. Oh well, fuck them. They are assholes. Then I went to the store with my mom. We got dog food, and LICORICE! LOL. I love that shit. Anywho. Yea. Tomorrow will be busy. I have French Club, and Thursday I have ESU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL!   ...till next time...
