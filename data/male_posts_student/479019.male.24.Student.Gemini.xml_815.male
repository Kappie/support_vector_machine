Looks like I'll be visiting my aunt and uncle in NJ for spring break. They have a nice quiet place for reading and stuff. I need to go get a bottle of wine as my usual gift for them, when I visit.  Roughly 100 pages down, about 200 more to go by Monday, plus a paper and bibliography. Happy happy joy joy!  I'm gonna go make myself a screwdriver and read more.  ***
