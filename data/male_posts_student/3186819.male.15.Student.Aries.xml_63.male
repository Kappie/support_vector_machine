THAT IS EXECUTIVE CLASS! That means I get a meal and an alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverage, FREE!!! I loves the first class already! On the way back I am in seat 1-F....BUT THATS STILL FIRST CLASS! Finally, no more squeezing my ample ass into tiny seats! Go first class!  Naturally I have a doctors appointment the monday before my flight. Go figures.
