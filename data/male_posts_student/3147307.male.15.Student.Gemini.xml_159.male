OK, it was lightning and thundering out and school rules say that you have to wait 15 minutes after lightning is seen to run outside. So, we went upstairs and ran through the halls of the school. We were allowed to go wherever we wanted for 20 minutes. It was short but killed the legs because the floor is not easy to run on. And today we did a speed/hill workout at Glenns Valley Nature Park and that ended up to be about 5.5 miles in total. It's a lot of fun. Our first meet is the 19th. and my goal for the season is a sub-20 5k. I'll post my times here each time I run to track my improvement (or hopeful improvement). In the one summer race I did, I ran a dissapointing 21:45. Heya were getting close to Saturday and I have no clue what is going on w/ Bible Bowl party. Oh and does anyone know when and where movie night is this week?  Where are we Runnin? - Lenny Kravitz  "Stadiums have spectators. We runners have nature and that is much better." - Juha Vaatainen  "Therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us." - Hebrews 12:1
