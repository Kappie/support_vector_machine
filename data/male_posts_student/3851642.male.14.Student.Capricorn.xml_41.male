I also started working at Kid Flix Camp, seems the newbies arn't that bad, better than what I've had to work with before. One more week, then I'm done with that. Ryan made me an awesome cape and mask, and made Brittany her God crown...that was pretty funny, though Kass didn't really like it, considering he was paying us for messing around ;-)  Oh, Steven dosn't know basic Star Trek triva...he deserves to be pelted with tricorders for the rest of eternity.
