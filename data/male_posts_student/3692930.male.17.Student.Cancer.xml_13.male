I have to admit that I'm not in the best shape weighing in 205lb. at 5ft. 7.5 in.    Todaywhich I still consider Friday (it's 3:59am right now) I was supposed to be picked up by the other soon-to-be Marines but got lucky and never was. It doesn't matter anyway, because I don't think I would be able to handle it since today I'm  VERY SORE.     Well I guess today ( technically Saturday) I'll do better.
