You make time appear distorted, colours appear brighter, sounds more sharper and things seem to change shape. Sometimes people are frightened by you and get scared of everything. You mess people up, one minute they could be laughing the next they are sobbing. Sometimes you disress people so much they try to commit suicide. When people have spent alot of time with you, they get a 'flashback', they could be on a train comming home from work and suddenly start mocking the bloke next to them who appears to have grown a long hairy snout like a rat.    urlLink Find Out If You Were A Drug, What You Would Be!    quiz by  urlLink ravenritings
