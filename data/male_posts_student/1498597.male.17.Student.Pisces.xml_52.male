Sorry for not consulting with  JR  first of course, but I thought it was a pretty good idea. Plus it took me a bit just to put all the links and pictures back on the site. Speaking of which...... we do need to add some snazzy things to the site I guess..  The quote for the "unspecified" time period has been replaced with a Harry Potter quote in honor of the new Harry Potter novel which came out this morning!  Until a later time! Stay tuned!
