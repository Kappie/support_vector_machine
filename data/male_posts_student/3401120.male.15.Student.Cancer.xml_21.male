And where am I going? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction Maybe I'm looking for any direction  This is not my war - This is not my fight This is something more - This is not my life (This is not my) Revolution (This is not my) Convolution (This is not my) Expectation (This is not my) Desperation  Holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it Look at me - I am the glorified malcontent Save me? Save this! All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven I'm sick - Of being the but of a cosmic joke And I don't get the punch line A million people lined up for miles To see the great big mouth shut up and apologize  This is not my war - This is not my fight This is something more - This is not my life (This is not my) Revolution (This is not my) Convolution (This is not my) Only reason to question why  Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye! Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here Today, I said goodbye!  I'm the pariah (Break me) I am the liar (Save me) I can take anything (Make me) Accuse me of everything (Take me) Cut off the system (Shape me) Deny my existence (Waste me) I won't be afraid (Try me) I won't be unmade (Deny me)  So come on - Break it off Come on - Buy the lie Come on - Say it, say it Come on Say goodbye! Goodbye! Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye! Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here Today, I said goodbye!  One - One Two - Two Three - Three NIL!
