It's all shit and that's the way it will probably stay until Friday night when we will put on a powerhouse mediocre performance to end a shitty run of shitty shit.  Those worries discussed in 'The butterflies attack' were not without reason. I shall write again after the matinee, simply to tell you how poorly it went. Hmm. Argh.
