Jefe: I like how you decided to collect lures "after you saw their value." I can imagine your grandma sitting there, "Now, here, Jeffrey, these were your grandfathers favorite lures. He spent his whole life collecting these. He wanted you to have them, and add to the collection with some of your own." Jeff's like, okay, I'll just dump them somewhere, jeez. "Oh, and they're probably worth maybe a few thousand dollars, besides." Jeff's like, whoa, I think I'll collect them now.  Furthermore... Theres a distinct problem with John's whole deal and whatnot. Firstly, he's split between us and Pammy. This wouldn't be too bad. However, I sense that the inidvidual causing more strife than anyone else is none other than Chris Oseland. Being retarded to socially acceptable behavior, or at least not willing to display it if he's not, John doesn't want to hang around with Chris AND Pammy at the same time. He's forced to divvy up his time between the two. And, sometimes he chooses Pammy. This is totally understandable. Pammy... or Kraus. Hmm, toughy. Then Mattson gets offended-like.  Also, I don't see why you guys get into tizzys and hernias over what kind of music people listen to. Sheesh. It's just music. Let's all settle down and stop caring about it. Oh, no, you're listening to certain music that only  I  am supposed to listen to because I'm different and better. You're padding yourself so that people think better of you because you listen to this music. I don't care for people to judge me by the freakin music I listen to, okay, so everyone just chill out and lay off.  Adios.  PS Tommorrows the deadline, I'll post later in the day, but get your guesses in on those quotes!
