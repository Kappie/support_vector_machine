Well, I did give one away for a dance mat, which was a good trade.  (Sucks for you Kevin!)  Anyways, the oh-so-happy/commercial time is almost upon us.  I've been thinking of doing a photo update for a lonnng ass time, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I'll probably do one for Christmas, shoing you all the neat (or craptacular) things I get.  Which should be fun.  Oh yeah, have fun on Winter Break...God knows I am with this great Earthquake we had!  That was fun!  Mainly because I had no freakin' clue that it was happening..but yeah.  Anyways, I'm going to draw an Atari Penguin.  Ta.
