When I didn't get up my mom nagged at me until I finally gave in and got up at around 9:30.  I started getting ready and left with the gifts at around 10:55. When I got there Jason, Douglas and Mark were already there. Finally a few minutes after me Alex showed up. And a short while after Sam, Connie and Mylien. A few minutes after that Lauren showed up.  We went to eat. And after that Lauren and Sam left, as well as Jason and Doug. The rest of us went to see a Harold  Kumar go to white castle. It was a good movie funny yet stupid. It's a comedy why would one expect. After that we went to Fry's and did a couple of circles there. For an hour or so. After that we went to Petco. Then Half Priced Books. I was bored out of my mind and so took my leave then.  Then in my military fashion I left to home.  It's odd how aware one is when their back is straight. It's almost like I was a spy looking around. When I got home I played my guitar for a few minutes around 20 :p and then went to the bank to deposit some money and do the laundry.  Then I came here. Sat around for a few minutes and then picked up the laundry and then came here to write this.  Love is hard to do, I have to completely change myself. This life of me is just too mundane and crappy. Need to do something new and unusual. Just out of the ordinary.  Crossed legged doesn;t hurt no more. Just feels wierd.
