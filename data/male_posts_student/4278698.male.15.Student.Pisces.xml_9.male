In these nights, only in these nights, I can get that feeling; feel you as if you were here…                         Feeling the heat that your body drains, feeling the sweet voice that your mouth speaks, feeling your heart beating as if it was mine… I almost can see you, but it was only a shadow, just another shadow, and you are not here with me…
