This tragedy happens so often, that there’s just so little that our race can do about it. Incase, you havn’t guessed, or were too lazy to read the title, yes, I have been a victim once again of bad haircut syndrome. A bad, bad haircut. It used to be longish.... Kinda like Harry Potter’s! Except a bit longer.... But now it’s short. Very short. I meant to get it short, but now I look like George freakin bush! This isn’t the first time this has happened to me you know!!!! About once or twice in my life I’ve actually gotten what I wanted!!! Here is a typical example:  “I’d like a mushroom cut please” “Oh. Like the guy on page one!” “no. Not at all. Actually... I’ll just get a ceaser” “Oh! Just like this guy on page one!” “No. That’s a mohawk I do believe. And I’m pretty sure it’s a chick too.  Just shave it off please.” “Like this guy on page one has it?” “Actually... I don’t need a haircut that bad... Thanks anyway.”  And somehow, I still end up with really crappy hair when I walk out. When my career as a lawn gnome maker has made me rich, I’m going to donate all my money to a barber college, so that they can get trained to cut someones hair in a fashion that doesn’t look like anyone on page one.    -Louis (the yanking yankee)     lol   look! A tie fighter!!
