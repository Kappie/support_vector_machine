I cooked food while mimi watched some TV and after I was done cooking we started the movie. Not to long into the movie Precious started having a seizure. She has had these seizures before but never this bad. It wasn't letting up. She was on the floor flopping around, her body stiff as a rock and she was getting tired from it, I could see that. MiMi was crying and I was confused. We had no money and I could not make a decisive decision. I finally said, "Let's just take her to the vet hospital and deal with whatever."  So we took her over to the local 24 hour vet and they gave her a shoot of valium and kept her over night. The doc told us that she has epilepsy and that she will have to be on meds for the rest of her life. poor puppy.  She is fine now, just a little sleepy. The drug she has to take is a barbiturate, and it is the same medication used on humans for epilepsy.   As far as everything else, I am off for the next couple of days so I am stoked. A chance to look for jobs. mimi gets home around 1:30 so we are gonna hit the gym a little while and head back home to clean up the apartment a bit. I am looking forward to Thanksgiving because I am heading out to BigTrees, CA and play in the snow and eat some food with mimi's dad and their family.   I think I have finally decided what major I am gonna go for when I start school. I still have 10 months to figure this out. I am gonna get a BS in Biology with a concentration on Ecology and Evolution and minor in Anthropology. When that is done I can hit grad school either towards Biology or Anthropology. UC Davis has an awesome Bio-tech school so I might go for a masters there. But Berkeley is my main focus, gotta keep those grades up. That is all I am her to do, go to school. I don't need to make new friends, they just end up needing time to figure out. I think I have friends right now that will last a life time, and they are in texas or somewhere else but here. I love my friends, I just want to keep it that way. I like how it feels now, I don't have that nagging obligation to go see a "local band" and all that bullshit. Fuck your scene shit, it's a hopeless cause, and a worthless one at that. I'm a rambling man. I have to ramble on baby.   current mood:  calm current music: jets to brazil - perfecting loneliness
