I haven't said anything though. If he does anything like it when I meet him, I will catch him out. *shifty eyes*  The other day Tanya asked me to do our english assignment together, 'n' I said yes. Today in Maths she was talking to Glen and he asked if she was doing it with me. She said no, he didn't believe her and called out to me "I'm not doing my english think with you am I Adam?", but she said it as if I was the devil and she'd never do anything with me. I was a bit cut =|.  Tara confronted me about her not liking me or some such. She said something along the lines of "I do". Oh, and I'm going to the formal next year with Emma. Wo0t ;). She owes me a kiss at midnight anyway... :D  Baha, I'm on the phone to Kieran (again). Yeh... Wah wah wah. All he does is whinge :P Ah well. I luff him!
