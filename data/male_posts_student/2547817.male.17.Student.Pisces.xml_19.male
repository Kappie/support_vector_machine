I wanted to write  song with Shane, but looks like we're both prerrt tired. Wait, I just asked him if he was tired and he said no. Looks like I'm the tired one. Shane is strong. Full of muscles. Incredible. He's sitting with his shirt off beside me. Huray! I wish I were like Shane. I wish I were like Shane. Haiz. I dont believe I just said that. I'm tired. Goodnight.
