I am the only councilor without a CIT, but I don't really mind because the kids are GREAT!  Well, most of them anyways...there always one or two.  I think pone of them is going to switch groups because he feels he is too old for my group even though he was having a lot of fun today.  But in his place, I might be getting back two of my favorite kids in the entire camp so that is definitely a giant plus!  This session is really young as a whole, so the age I really like to work with is up two levels from what I have now, but as I said before, I really don't mind.  I have a good feeling about this session.  In other news, when I played my dad in Ace Combat 4 today, I beat him at least eight times.  No joke, he is really not that very good at it.  He just doesn't have the extensive training wasting his brain power on something so useless as videogames as I do.  Too bad...  Ummm, I can't really think of anything to say today, which is quite a surprise to me because I'm usually so full of useful and worldly knowledge and experiences to share with you all, but today I'm just drawing a blank.  Oh wait, before you go I just thought of something very interesting for all you history buffs out there, and maybe not history buffs who are just reading on because you have nothing better to do.  World War II in the Pacific did not actually end with the dropping of the second A-bomb on Nagasaki.  After the bomb was dropped, the emperor want to surrender to the Allies, but there was a coup that almost prevented him from doing so.  A lucky B-29 raid over Japan at the time of the coup forced a air-raid blackout that stalled the coup just long enough for a loyal part of the military to restore order and the emperor finally did unconditionally surrender.  Wow, now isn't that just incredible.  I know most of you couldn't give a care, but I thought it was interesting, so humor me.  Now I am completely empty of all relevant stories, so leave before I get angry, and you're not going to like me when I'm angry.  Out
