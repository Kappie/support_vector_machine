I called this person from Myrtle Beach and asked her if it were possible that we could be more than just friends. Part of me wanted her to say that she wanted to be bf and gf. But the other part of me (the majority) was actually proud of what she said. She replied,"Yes I do but I dont want to be bf and gf yet. We have only met once ya know." Im really glad she said that. I like this girl. Her name is Mario by the way hence the title of this post. This girl can make me feel a lot of different feelings all at once. That is kinna creppy in my book cuz that usually doesnt happen. But the best part is her free spirit. I love free spirits. I love how they are so out of this world. That makes things interesting. And it keeps me interested. Which is a good thing. Well I just thought I would throw that out there being as I havent written in my blog in a long while. Well cyaz!
