I can't take this happy happy life thats going on when not everything is going well. I'm sick of saying yes i'll listen. I have stuff to deal with as well. This isn't directed to anyone by the way. don't feel hated. just needed to get it off my chest for everyone inn the entire planet to see. This is lame. I'm going to stop now. Back to normality.
