I'll make this a real winner. This week was far from being "da-bomb". On Sunday night, I fell asleep _very_late_. I woke up on time, got ready on time, and even got to school early. Problem was, I forgot my Concerta, the thing that makes my day go by. Some of you might have noticed me falling asleep, drooling, or staring into space. I apologize for that. The clincher for Monday: I got a thesis paper assignment. 7-8 pages (double spaced; thank you Microsoft for the one thing you actually did right) about gothic horror. Now, I'm not typically one to whine about long assignments, usually owing to their far away due dates. My english teacher decided that two and a half weeks would be plenty of time for this sucker. After all, we do have the whole vacation to work on that, right. Pfft.  The rest of the week went a little better, mostly because I remembered my Concerta. I should give some of it to all my friends, so if I ever forget it, they can all just give me some.  "Eric, you aren't paying attention today. Are you okay?" "Just gimme a few red caps. I think I'll manage if you just help me out." This week is going to suck. I can feel the finger looming about the giant vacuum switch. It will only be a three day + three period week, but that makes it just that much harder. You see, my fellow students, I will be traveling to the Bahamas on Thursday. I know, I know. Don't think I have forsaken you. If you give me a dollar, I'll even buy you a trinket; two dollars, and I'll buy you some booze. Psyche!  I'll be back on Wednesday in the middle of the vacation, so I can have a shindig with some of you poor folks.  I will also be missing the yearly School street tradition we call "Squash Drop". My neighbors decided to drop a squash off their front porch. Lame? Yes. Fun? Sort of.  Ok, this wasn't a winner, but I felt like telling you all the shitty things I've been up to. Peace for now, hate for later.
