That night, the boy's little brother started crying because he pooped in his diaper. Not wanting to wake his mother, he peeked through the keyhole in his nanny's room and finds that his dad is screwing her.  The next morning, the boy says to his dad, "I think I understand politics now."  And his dad says, "Okay son, why don't you tell me in your own words about politics." And the little boy said, "The economy is screwing the working class,while the government is sleeping.The people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit."
