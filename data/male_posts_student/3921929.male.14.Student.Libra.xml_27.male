He never played it before and he said it was fun so he's prolly gonna buy it. Then we skated even longer at the school until about 7:30. So Matt followed me everywhere all day, which got pretty annoying and boring. I told him he should leave when my parents left for the airport (Mom's goin to Las Vegas) but dumbass Scott said it was alright for him to stay, RUINING MY PLAN!! Dumbass. Oh well, it was still kinda fun.  I also finished my hoverboard_wars map for CS, but I might need to add a few more things later. And I don't have anywhere to upload it, so I can't share it with anybody. That was the only map I worked on today. I played another fun map, cs_bikini. It's a beach with a tennis court, pool, and a house. It's really good and someone must have spent about a month on it.  Fuck it, I'm tired, see ya.
