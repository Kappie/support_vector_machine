I woke up around 5:30 am (after about 4 1/2 hours of sleep; I couldn't stop thinking about my toenails being ripped off, or, should I ever become a mortician, a corpse suddenly opening it's eyes and staring at you---all accusinglike, like "HEY! You're cutting slits in my jugular arteries, bleeding me dry, and pumping me full of nasty chemicals! STOP THAT!"), or those ever so wonderful thoughts of there is something that is under the bed I know it.  I can see the dead white hands, why should I step onto the floor?  All to the pleasant sound of my plundered Cinderella alarm clock. I was completely ready by 6:15 which meant I had an hour to sit around the house and watch scantily clad parents get themselves up.  PATRIOTS! Overall it was an incredibly exciting game. So close though and I think the Panthers played really really well. I'm pretty sure they'll be back. The stupid halftime show sucked and those 2 attention whores really need that publicity huh? "Wardrobe malfunction" my ass.  What is up with all these commercials with clowns (it’s a phobia dude) in it? I fuckin’ saw 4 of them today and I wanted to break the TV! Im gonna have to stop watching anything if they keep it up. Clowns are EVIL!!  Like “IT” I cry at that movie.  TIME... An age old concept, right? You hear scientists talk about it. But do you? Do you ever wonder about what it really is? Do you ever wonder about what it means to your everyday life? Just what is it really? Is it just a concept? Why does it even exist? For what possible reason could it serve? Without it, it seems there could be a lot stress, right? I'm sure there's a million other little questions like these that you could come up with, and of course just as many answers (if you really wanted to come with them). But let's try to start as basic as we can, much simpler than any little trite phrase or description you might have heard about it. Let's try to be original in our little investigation here and not use what others have said about this thing called "time". While I'm here on this little topic of "originality", let me say a few words. To me, this little... Boy, I sure do like that word "little"! There seems to be a reason for it (at least at this point of my writing), and that is that I'm just poking a little (oops... couldn't help it, it just snuck in) fun at the topic of conversation while also emphasizing that it really isn't such a little topic. And speaking of "little", I hate using caps. They seem kind of meaningless, unless I’m trying to emphasize my point. Cap'ing requires that I type extra keys, so not doing so saves a little on the fingers. So from now on you won't see them in the "proper" way or maybe they will it depends on the time. Also, in case you're interested, I don't like to put the periods or commas inside quotations. That too seems a little meaningless. The item inside the quotes includes only that item and not the period or comma. So why include them? Whoever came up with that idea???!!!! Anyway, back to our investigation... the little investigation, that is. Originality, to me, represents whatever is true for me or you, no matter what anyone else says. Of course, that seems obvious. But do you ever notice when you're not "original"? Never mind that, even though that's an issue very much worth pursuing. Perhaps a more important question is, can you ever be truly "original"?  All these letters I’m using here to create all these words are all borrowed. I was taught these. What about the ideas and questions that I/we are playing around with here? Are they, could they ever be, "original"?  Of course we've come across ideas that we've read or heard somewhere and we ourselves had had those ideas come to us at an earlier time and at that time we thought or felt that it was the first time we ever experienced that idea. That idea was "original", wasn't it? Maybe a little more easy to recall are the feelings we've had. Anger... fear... joy... can anyone honestly say that such feelings are original? Of course there's always the argument that no one can really ever know what another is feeling, so one really can never know whether or not such feelings are "original". This argument falls along the same lines as that of the color one sees. Do we all really "see" the same color red, or green, or purple? And you can say the same about anything each of us experiences, such as "love", for example. Of course, to really be able to follow through with this little investigation, we must look at how we "know" things. If I say, "I know how you feel", what am I really saying? What do I really mean? What can you honestly say about such a situation as far as your experience is concerned if you were the one who made that statement? Don't we simply attach our own feelings the person's behavior we are observing? Of course there are those who are absolutely certain that they can feel what others feel, and I’m not denying that they do. After all, how would I know that that is not true?  And this is really my point. Can we ever really know what is true? Unfortunately, got to run now I will write more later, much more later...........
