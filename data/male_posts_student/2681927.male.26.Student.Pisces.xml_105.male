Lance Armstrong and Ivan Basso (not to mention Armstrong's team mate Jose Azevedo) had a superbyesterday on thestage from Lannemezan to Plataeu de Beille in the Pyrenees. Armstrong is second on theGC and Basso third,the gapis one minute and 17 seconds. Armstrong is 22 seconds behind the leader, young Thomas Voeckler but he won't keep the yellow jersey for long, he will probably lose it on Tuesday.    The other contenders are far behind, so the battle is between Armstrong and Basso. There arefour mountain stages in the Alps (one time trial) and yet another time trial next week. Since Lance is the better of the two in time trials, Basso needs to outperform Armstrong with a couple of minutes in the Alps. At the moment, it doesn't sound very likely that that is going to happen. So, sixth TdF in six years for Lance Armstrong. Impressive, impressive in deed.
