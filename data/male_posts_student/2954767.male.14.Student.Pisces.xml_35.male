Everytime, whenever i'm doing ma duty after recess, i'm supposed to check the attires of the pupils and to check to see if they've brought any food or drink back ta class... and these gals.. i catch them everyday.. for not tuckin in their shirts.. and they find the fact that it's amusin.. everytime i scold them, they smile and laugh and snicker.. damn it.. i jus want to take off ma tie and jus SLAP and SLAP and SLAP them each on their faces at least 50 times.. but i controlled maself and told maself not to abuse ma authority... do u know how hard is it to do that? dammit.. anyway, they even enjoyed the so-called game which is to untuck their friends' shirts! [they do it among themselves] that is like sooooooooo sick.. psycho.. wtf.. and when i scold them, they like ta retort that they are not in the wrong and whatsoever.. SHIT them.. bunch of wannabe ah lians.. freakos.. hmph.. then one day, mr Tse finally saw their true colours and helped me settle tha prob! muahahahhhahahaha.. u lose, i WIN! or-b!! lalalaalal.. hmph.. hm.. but they've not really changed much.. there were actually 5 of them.. but one of them, Stephanie, was not so bad.. at least she knows when ta stop.. there's hope for her... lol.. well.. abt today.. ponteng sch.. y'know why? cos i'm friggin tired.. i went for the Black Eyed Peas concert yesterday.. friggin cool.. and i went home at abt 10 or 11? cant' remember.. but i do know that i was exhausted and i slept at round 1.. sigh.. and this morn, i tried ta wake up.. but to no avail.. lol.. i was like a dead person sleepin.. even ma granny's thunderous voice couldn't wake me up.. perhaps it jarred me up as little.. cos i remembered her askin me if i wanna go ta sch anot.. and i replied in teochew 'mai laaaaaa' and i continued sleepin.. lol.. hm.. guess i'll stop here.. but i have lotsa to share with y'all.. be back later.. ma stomach's growling.. hehe.. ciao.. love 2E2!! rock ONNNNN
