Rox's egg:  Yes, balot is good.  When I was a kid and taste was still oblivious.  Now, I don't eat balot so I cannot confirm.  Why, Pabs?  You believe you see on TV that Filipinos eat that disgusting duck egg already in its maturation?  Well, other Pinoys do (as I said, I have no nationality, tee hee).  It is not disgusting.  Maybe it is "Exotic" for you.  I do eat Chicharon Bulaklak (Pig's Large Intestines), and it tastes cool.  I also eat Ice cream.  DIRTY ice cream (and they dubbed it that just because it is sold on the road, like in other countries.  Stupid nomer).
