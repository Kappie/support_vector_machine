The house is really really nice, but the room is smaller than a federal prison cell.  10 feet by 9 feet.  but maybe i want it anyway?  it's cheap and in a great section of town.  basketball hoops across the street, two grocery stores around the corner, the roomates seem cool, a gorgeous new kitchen, a sun room.  if i had 1 more foot of space there wouldn't be a question, but this thing is small.  room for a bed, a small desk.  that's it.
