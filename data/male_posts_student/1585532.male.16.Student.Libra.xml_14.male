As I watch TV right now, I see a truck rocking back and forth...Uhh, that makes no sense?  Anyways, yah so you will have pictures this week, and sorry that I didn't update the random picture of the week, I've been having trouble getting onto my site lately....Gotta love AOL.....God damnit I hate AOL.  Anyways yah Disneyland, uh yah.  Have fun with whatever you guys are doing today.  I'm bored now....lost track of what I was talking about..Ta.
