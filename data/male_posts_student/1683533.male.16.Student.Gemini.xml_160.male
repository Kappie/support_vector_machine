All I know is that I was right about my paranoia: there are alot of people I know that hate me secretly.  Anybody that reads this and hates me please comment on why you hate me and who you are. please stop the anonymous bashing...  I just want to say to whoever said I labeled myself different things different days, I dont do that, I dont recall it at least.  I like lots of music, and some months i listen to certain stuff more than others, and I just talk about what I am listening to at the moment.  Jessi, I'm sorry, I dont know much about colleges, and I am sorry I didnt feel like getting involved.  But I wish you didnt see my actions as temper tanrums, I have problems too, and I wish you would recognize them too sometimes, I go to counseling and I take medicine too.  Maybe we both need to be more open to eachother's problems.  I love you.  So, just lay it on me, all my friends and enemies, post why you hate me, its a free-for-all.  I dont want to sound more like a crybaby, but I have to go cause I am bursting.  Sorry.
