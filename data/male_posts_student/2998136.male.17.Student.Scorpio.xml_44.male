This lesson deals with parties: how to host them, how to attend them.  There are basically four different types of parties:   Informal parties  – These spontaneous affairs are attended by a small group of close friends.   Mini parties  – These spontaneous affairs are attended by a close group of small friends (e.g. pygmies, elves, dwarves etc.) Snow White used to have lots of these mini parties, until her downstairs neighbour complained.   Celebration parties  – The people are wined and dined, and are invited to commemorate a special occasion (e.g. graduation, birthday, capture of first boyfriend, etc).   Opposition parties  – No food for the people, no music… and that’s all stated in the Manifesto.   Guest who?   A good teenager must realize that the secret to the success of any type of party depends on who’s on the guest list.  The Teenage Textbook  recommends that you invite the following types of people:  (1)	The Rich and Famous - Such guests will raise the tone of the party greatly. Teenagers will usually be sufficiently impressed by the following categories of Rich and Famous guest: National Sportspeople. Famous Fashion Models, Offspring of Rich  Famous People, People Who Have Made Song Requests on Radio, People Who Can Drive Cars, etc.  (2)	The Life and Soul - Your party would be empty without this guest. The ‘Life and Soul’ of every party takes the lead in making a fool of himself and sets everyone else at ease. Such a person should have a low IQ and an even lower sense of humour. If you cannot find a ‘Life and Soul’ simply hire a mobile disco DJ who can usually be relied upon to make a fool of himself for a small fee.  (3)	The Silent Majority – You will need a lot of these people to add ‘bulk’ to your guest list. Generally speaking, guests who make up the silent majority are not able to make conversation or communicate verbally. They are also so plain and anonymous that their own mothers would have difficulty recognizing them. Such people include students in charge of the library, students who take two maths subjects, teenagers with bad breath and people who win Mr and Miss Personality contests.  (4)	The Trendies -  Such teenagers are not rare. Dressed in fashionably feminine designer wear, bright, chunky jewellery and earrings, beautiful eye-makeup, blood-red lip gloss… and the girls are even worse.  (5)	The Wallflower – Have one of two of these lonely people around, and your other guests will feel much better about themselves. People who are ignored or avoided in real life make the best wall-flowers. Therefore you should pick teenagers who are aspiring poets, score more than 6 A’s at O-level or speak in words of more than two syllables.   Important note  So far, you may have noticed that  The Teenage Textbook  has been dealing with advice on how to host an informal party. Formal balls are different. How, then, should one throw a ball? With an over-hand motion, a smooth delivery, a twist of the thumb and a lot of follow-through.
