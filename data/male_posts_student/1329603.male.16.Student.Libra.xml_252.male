LFN weren't there... my fault really that, I didn't organise it very well. Ah well, could've been worse. My head is hurting, though...  Um... I can't think of anything else...  There's something I wanna say to someone but I won't. *shrugs*  Quote of the day: "Nothing you can do that can't be done, Nothing you can sing that can't be sung, Nothing you can say that can't be said in another way, It's easy."
