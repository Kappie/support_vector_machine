We didnt have to many projects this week so after our markstrat session on thursday we went to watch the elections in Iceland University, which realy do suck but they have cheap beer :) The reason why they suck is that they have all the same goals its almost like the same party, historically one is a right wing party and the other one left so in the right one those who want to become right wing poltitians go there and others on the other side. My best friend when I was nine was the right wing candidate so I supported them a little more but honestly didnt give  fuck. I only ment to drink a couple of beers but ended up going to this party and at around 5 in the morning me and an old friend went to share a cap. When we came to my place the friend came with me so I thought he wanted stay over so I went to pick up a sleeping bag and such, but when we came inside he started hitting on me seriously which I didnt like. The problem ofcourse is that my friend is a he... like Manolo said "my ass is a one way street".  I didnt show up for school on Friday because of hangover but managed to do one thing that day, play football, I sucked big time but ce la vie.  On Saturday I went to my schools football competition where made only one draw in three matches but it was fun. Later that night I went to a party at one of my teammates and we all got drunk (we were like 15 of us). It was a load of fun especially the drinking game which I recorded and may even send all of ya copy, pretty funny. Afterward we went downtown and in the end I managed to find a place to stay for the night, the only thing I had to do is help the girl with some "workout" that same night:) A good deal.  I came home at 13 the day after and watch 3 football matches during that day. The most enjoyable was Barcelona-Atletico which Barca won 3-1:) We are now in a champion league position:)  I think this is it for now but I did sign Manolo up after meeting him on MSN (Kat and Seems hrm...hrm..) but he hasnt accepted yet.  Well later, Ãšlli
