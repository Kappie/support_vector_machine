Eternal Sunshine has emerged as both Charlie Kaufman's and Michel Gondry's best work. I sincerely hope that Kaufman can keep up this level of creativity for at least a few more films.  Summer was pretty weak at first, with a bunch of mediocre offerings finally offset by the documentaries Super Size Me and Fahrenheit 9/11. Then came Spider-Man 2, possibly the best comic book film yet made and on top of that, a truly great showcase for director Sam Raimi. This guy deserves to be in the pantheon. He is both a unique visual stylist and a fantastic director of actors. Anyway, here is the list. I recommend all of the following highly.  1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2. Kill Bill Volume 2 3. Super Size Me 4. Fahrenheit 9/11 5. Napoleon Dynamite 6. Spider-Man 2 7. Touching the Void 8. Hellboy 9. The Passion of the Christ 10. The Five Obstructions  I'll be back later with "The Movies That Sucked."
