My school does this program for kids that are in K-5.  It teaches them the basics of wrestling, so that if they want to join the wrestling team they will already know some things.  It is fun.  I am also teaching the camping merit badge in scouts.  This is an easy merit badge to teach.  Well I have to go and teach some wrestling.  See ya!
