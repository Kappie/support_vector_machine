Why did you learn it is a better question that I would be happy to answer for someone. Writing in yearbooks, feeling awkward at not knowing what to write. Thinking about how pointless it is to tell someone to have a great summer. How trite. How over-done. Gone is the year! Gone is hope? Gone is that shining ray of light? Hardly. One thing I've learned this year is to smile. That's how we're all connected. When I see someone smile, I just realize there are 6  billion  people in this world. That's a lot. It's almost impossible to fathom all the lines of life. Impossible. Not necessarity to try. Merely an Aufforderung zur Bescheidenheit, hah. We could all use one of those.   Germany draws near, and the peak of excitement is coming closly behind. In a few weeks I get the final answer, and possibly my life crushed.  Even though I make it seem like there is all this stuff going on, there is really only one thing, person rather, that I can think about, but I refuse to let  all  those loyal fans of my blog to be bored! Mwha. I refuse to get a girlfriend, and then change my entire style of blog! Hah. I've seen that happen too many times, and although it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just not what I like! This does not mean she is less important, it just means none of you need to pretend to care about it :D. Rambling...   Hmm...How to end this without being exactly like the millions of other blogs... "Well, that's my rambling for the day" or what not.        Hot dog!
