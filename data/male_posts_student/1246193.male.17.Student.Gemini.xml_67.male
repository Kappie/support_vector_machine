I don't know that ignore is the right word but whatever he is doing is driving me nuts.  I will be talking to my mother and out of nowhere he will just start talking to her about something completely different.  He strikes up a conversation with someone whom I am already speaking to.  I didn't think much about it until tonight.  He was talking to me and just stopped in the middle of a sentence and turned his attention to the television.  I then spent the next fifteen minutes trying to pry the remaining sentence out of him along with the answers to some following questions.  I asked a question three times...THREE TIMES...then, without an answer I turned the tv off and came upstairs.  He just yelled to ask me if I said something.  He is probably thinking about work, that's what it usually is.  I am just feeling frustrated, I know that some people's fathers are significantly worse than mine.
