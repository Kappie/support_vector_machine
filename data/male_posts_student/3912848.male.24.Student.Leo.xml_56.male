I had to read down into the 13th paragraph before finding out  who  the pimp had raised funds for: Hillary Clinton, Joeseph Liberman, and yes,  John Kerry .  If the guy had been raising funds for a Republican candidate, the headline would have read: "Bush refuses to comment on fundraiser-orgy" or "Cheney blocks probe into alleged sex-ring fundraising."
