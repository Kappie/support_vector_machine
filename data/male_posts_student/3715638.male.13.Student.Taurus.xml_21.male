But I didn't really good and came in first so I get a   gold    metal for that! Then I had freestyle, which I also won, so thats    gold    metal number 2. Then I had relay which was 15-18. We were the only ones to as long as we don't DQ in any way, we would get first place. So, in total, I got 3    gold    metals! Yea!!!!    So now I'm waiting until my dad gets home and then we are going to the Revolution game in Foxoboro. I have seats 6 rows up from the field so their really good. Ally, Erica, and Laura are also going to it so I might see them, but I don't know because they are up in a box.
