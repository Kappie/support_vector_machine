First, we stopped off in France for 2 days in a hotel in Cahors to break the journey down a bit, there was much staying up late hiding in people's rooms so the Tutors couldn't find us. But Sam wasn't too good at that so he got us all caught twice - the second time we managed to get 13 of us in a  small  bathroom. We played a concert to some Americans, they gave us a standing ovation (cos we rock) But then we had to go watch them play, they played some Jazz, which was good, but they were all pretty fat.    Then, in Spain we went to a theme park, a water park, lots of bars, the beach, different concert venues, swimming pools and general Barcelona city centres, and I was with alot of good friends, which was nice, along with the weather - hot and sunny everyday, but somehow I didn't burn. w0op. Dave also managed to buy the hat he's been after for ages, and I got a mug from the theme park. The 8 loop roller coaster "Dragon Khan" kicked ass.    On the last night after the last concert there were the awards, I got a joint award with 2 other people "Tosser(s) of the tour award" this is refering to a drunk night of me being stubborn, silly and general refusing to go tobed - whichmade some people laugh, and gave some othersa headache...and the other two people being sick everywhere, so I was quite good compared to them. That's 2 awards in 2 years (last year, me and Dave got the look alike award) and that's pretty damn lucky, cos there are about 60 people and about 10 awards, and it meant I got bubbles and a clap from everyone. Oh, and James "can't get it up" sorry... had to put that "in" joke in there somewhere.
