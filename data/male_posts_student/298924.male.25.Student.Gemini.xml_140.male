Dad's surgery was successful....it was eating me up being her in Nashville while it was going on....and I blew up my mom and two sisters cell phones trying to get updates....but he is doing fine.....he got re-trached and was super hungry but he had no complications....thanks for all of you who were concerned and kept us in your thoughts and prayers....hopefully this will be the end of this nightmare....  The program ended on Thursday....now I don't hate much in this world....but I DO hate public speaking....I sweat....I shake....I just don't like it....so imagine my disdain when I'm called up to speak to the students at the banquet....Now I must say I was killing them looks wise....I had on my favorite bow tie (I might have been dong THE MOST and been completely overdressed....but still I looked good....I got alot of compliments).....but I didn't quite know what to say....I got to speak last out of the three mentors that spoke....and I kept my words brief.....but I got a standing ovation.....I don't really know why....I didn't say much and I didn't say ANYTHING profound....but one of the students told me later that I was their favorite mentor because I "really cared about them when alot of people didn't"....I'm glad I could make them feel that way....  I went to see Austin Powers in Goldmember that night....I was expecting it to be packed....so much so that Geoff and I ordered 10 tickets on Fandango just to be CERTAIN that we had tickets....we had a group of eleven so you can imagine our fear in not being able to get everyone in....when we arrived there were 4 frigging people in the theater....it was like we had a private showing....anyway, the movie was great...to address the questions most asked about the movie (in no particular order):  Beyonce is not spectacular but she doesn't take anything away from the movie, and she looks better than Liz Hurley and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) combined....Mini-Me and Austin's Dad are the two best characters in this one.....Goldmember is funny as hell but one of those characters you really don't want to look at all of the time.....and well Fat Bastard is still very funny....the movie takes some twists and turns that you don't really expect but for the most part (with one big exception) all of the twists are good and very funny....much has been made in critic circles about the cameos, to me they were well placed and VERY funny....overall I say it is neck and neck with the second one in terms of overall quality and I give it an A-.....  Didn't do much outside of getting paid yesterday.....I picked up NCAA College Football 2003 and went to hooters for wings and beer...  I also talked with a classmate....I was getting ready to fuss at her about not hanging with us and not returning my calls when she told me her father had died....I felt so terrible.....it's yet another reminder of how short and fleeting life really is....she is such a sweet young woman and I hate to see her having to deal with such pain because she is so outgoing and lively, but she seems to be holding up well....  it's so hard to keep a good outlook when life keeps rolling you snake eyes....but I'mma keep playing till my last chip is down....  Anyway I'm 2 weeks overdue on a haircut....and I have clothes to wash....life doesn't stop....  (P.S. Beth....my application is in the mail...I've been waiting for a job opening like that....you know the economy is in bad shape....one thing though?....do I have to act like Puffy's guy??.....cuz I would have to withdraw my name....)
