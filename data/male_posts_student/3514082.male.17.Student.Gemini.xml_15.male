We decided we were going to try and paddle through the creeks to Morston (about 3km away), so we set off padling and got about a km into the creeks and marshes and found ourselves stuck as by now the tide had gone out and there was no water in front or behind us (with high tide at 0500 and at 1700, being about 1100 at the time), it was low tide and we miscaculated just how little/none water there would be. So we decided to treck on down the river/mud until we needed a break. So we stopped for a break and then decided (after a brief sampha picking expidition and mud fight) to treck over the grassy marshes towards the water, so we did and it shreded our feet to pieces (painful, oowww!!) so we went in the next river bed we found for a while and then back onto the marsh and repeated this for the next 2 hours or so. The repeated broken sharp shells and sharp marsh grass does not do anything for your feet (blood actuly came through the mud), although it is considerd a chinese torture method and I am now ready to join the British running on hot coals team, hehe. Eventually after some testing of pain thresholds muddy faces, mouths tasting of sampha and some burnt shoulders we got to the basin of Blakney water (also now empty of water and rather chilly by this point without sun and a strong northerly wind). We ravished until our food suplies were succesfully diminished (bar a small yellow tangerine and some more sampha) and the played around for a whike waiting for an hour or so until the tide. Just before getting to the basin we had to cross some realy sharp plants and mine and simons legs we raw (jez was clever enough to wear shoes) so greeting large puddles of luke warm water and soft sand/mud was the most blissful state of being you can imagine. After about an 1hour 1/2 and simon reciving repeted harrasment from "friendly" crabs the tide finaly decided to be nice to us and come back (albeit slowly), so all we had to do from then on was sit back in our floating kingdoms of mud (it was like a scene from water world except for you [ryck] or tom weren't there with your webbed feet, sorry hehe) doing nothing for a km but sit back in the canoes. So all in all we did the least amount of paddling on a canoeing trip and a rather alot of pulling. But it was very enjoyable despit the injurys and crab bites (or love bites in Simons case). And when we got back to blakeney key we were greeted by a wet milly and mum, who after helping us pack the canoes away, took us for fish and chips and returned home stinking of Blakney mud. But at least we didn't break a boat this time (well we did damage the seat on one of the canoes but a repair involving the end of a fishing net solved that) and we had a very enjoyable time. It's a real shame we only have three canoes because a massive canoe trip would be such a laugh. Anyways latter dudettes. Alex
