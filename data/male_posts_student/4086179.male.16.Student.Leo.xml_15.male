GOD is good. man this is so exciting. i am so at peace with myself, there is just two things in my life at the moment that satan is just trying so hard to attack. trying to bring me down. but bcos of joy, i am ok with it. well not ok with it but i dont really care. the feeling that i constantly have inside of me, is just excitment. so excited about who god is and what he is about. the fact that god is with me every step of the way. i am excited about who he is. i am rejoicing in God. things are tough, but bcos of joy i get through it with ease. blessed are those that are persecuted. i got that with me, so i know that despite what i cop God is there with me the entire time, watching me.
