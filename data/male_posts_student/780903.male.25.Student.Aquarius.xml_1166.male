No, don't tell me." 1: "It wasn't-- It wasn't that big of a deal, just the way the statute--" 2: "No, no... you opened the statute?" 1: "Yeah, a couple of times." 2: "I just used my notes." 1: "I was going to just use my notes, but then that question with the apricots, and there was nothing--" 2: "The hypothetical from class--" 1: "I don't know.  Stop, I don't want to know." 2: "Okay, okay.  But certainly the moral of that whole exam was Rule 92.  Rule ninety-freakin-two." 1: "92?  What?  What in the world is Rule 92?" 2: "Nevermind.  I didn't mean to--" 1: "Yeah, I don't want to--" 2: "Let's get some lunch." 1: "Okay."
