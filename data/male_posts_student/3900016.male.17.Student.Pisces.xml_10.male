I plan on going to college but who know what will happen. Colleges I have been looking at include: Calvin, Azusa Pacific, Augustana, Univ of Illinois, and UCLA. As for majors some considerations are engineering, psychology, graphic design, and architecture. The college and major I am currently leaning towards are Azusa Pacific and Psychology. Is it too early to be thinking about all this? I hope it all works out for the good...
