(like he was...i mean, even if i am not serious enough, who is he to give me a talk on MY attitude? even loris, the ex head librarian, didnt say anything. like what? he is my father or something?). of cos' jho isnt stupid. i said "sure, how bout tomorrow break?". and he agreed. hehe..i didnt turn up and just left him there waiting.   nothing really happened on tuesday. however, on wednesday, it was interact meeting. we came up with some game to like, get-to-know interactors. the game is like, everyone writes a question on a piece of paper, then at random, we will choose someone to pick a question and answer it loudly. but, i made a rule that the questions asked must be something that will make u know more bout the person. for instance, questions like "do u think u are sexy? if yes, why?" are accepted. however, questions like "do u think jia hoong is lame?" is SO NOT accepted. and yes, u guess it correctly. some a$$hole asked that question. i was like sungguh terasa towards the question. and guess which smart a$$ who followed my instructions asked that question? of cos its soon jeat, the  dog who thinks he can sing (just because he is in the choir) but seriously, he cant. i mean, not because im like mad at him because of the question (well...maybe a little) but, my point is, have u heard him singing that jay chou song on installation day? i swear in the name of my grandmother that jay chou sings a million times better than him (although i dun like jay chou).   thursday, which was yesterday, was like SO cool!! i met twins!! yay!! they were so cute!! ah sa wore this pink top which bares her back but she was wearing a black singlet inside. ah gill was wearing this white top. they look so darn cute! then jaycee looks exactly like the father...which means, in another words, ugly. wilson chen looks ok..i mean, he looks really "cool" as in both cool looking and quiet.   and here, today, we practised our interact presentation for a fund raising activity on monday (16/8). we are gonna sing "i knew i loved u" (my fave song!! yay!!) and "di persimpangan dilema"..some malay some by Nora. its kinda nice actually...hehe. but i hope it wouldnt rain on that day though.   the form threes trial is starting next week. this reminds me of last year, when i was in form 3. we were all so tensed and nervous then. however, now that pmr is over, its really nice when we think back bout those stupid lame days. i remember that a few friends and i were like memorizing some stupid history facts and not a single question was asked on that chapter. the form 3s this year are really dedicated and hardworking. everywhere u'll see them, they would be holding a book. and every morning, they would go to the canteen and sit and study together. yes..its THAT serious.   and here i am, now, writing my blog while recording some songs into MD for my sis. she siad she is bored in sg and she wanted to borrow my twins' cd. of cos' i said NO! i mean, i listen to twins everyday. if she is gonna take it away from me, how am i gonna survive?? how can i live without twins? so, i told her i would record all the songs into her MD and when mom visits her, which is tomorrow, she would pass it to her. and guess what? i'll be home alone during the weekends and on monday. well..not exactly home alone, cos grandma and grandpa would be here but, kinda "alone" as in i'll be by myself but not that "alone" but...forget bout it.   hmm..i guess i'll stop here. i have tonnes of homework to do. guess thats my only agenda for the weekends. later. ciaoz and nitey..   (._.)v peace!!
