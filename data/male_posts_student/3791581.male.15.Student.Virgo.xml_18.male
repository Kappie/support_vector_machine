At one point the heat was so intense that even I wasn't listening to what I was saying.  I cooled them down with frozen juice and Pocky Sticks.  (One of the tactics I use is to dose the kids with sugar to give them that extra 'perk'. Fun for me = fun for everyone!)  At the end of the day, I'd completely forgotten that I only had a bowl of cereal and a Krispy Kreme donut all day. It was one of those days where I'd scheduled students back to back and had not scheduled time to eat.    (Um, okay. So it was me coming down from the sugar.  The kids were fine.)  I spent the rest of the evening - not eating - but washing my car at my dad's house.  I suppose that my eulogy to Lolo sort of reinstated myself as 'also another  favorite'.  Dad's first favorite, CJ, the cat.  No joke.  So it's about 10pm, and I'm almost emaciated. I'll go upstairs and fix myself a nice...what,.... no rice??!! aargghhh!!
