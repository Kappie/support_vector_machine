This exam involves 1 hour and 45 minutes of incessant writing within two questions, one about a text you have studied (in my case 'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck) and another that involves comparing four different poems in a giant essay. I think I answered the question on how Steinbeck portrays the futility of dreams well, but I ran out of time slightly on the poem question which forced my conclusion to be a sentence long. My english teacher would be proud.
