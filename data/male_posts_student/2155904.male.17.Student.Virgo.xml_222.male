There was a lot of standing though and it would have been better without that but it was still fun doing it at Safeco Field.  The BBQ at the school was cool once the sun came out and made it not so cold.  It got a little chilly and then it got hot and then rainy.  But the gowns provided a nice little bit of insulation when it was cold.  After the BBQ they got on the buses and went to Safeco.  Being down underneath Safeco and on the field was pretty cool for Tyke since he loves baseball.  He took some dirt from the field, but upon realizing he had nothing to do with it, he threw it at Dudely Doo.  It was cool actually graduating but it still didn't feel right.  It just didn't feel like it was Tyke graduating.  How is he a senior???  It just isn't right.  When Tyke went up to get his "diploma" he did a little spin move before walking up the platform.  That was fun.  And he was on camera a lot too.  Up on the big screen.  His mom said she bought the DVD cuz he is on it so much.  He kept putting on a blank stare right into the camera whenever he saw it looking at him.  That was cool.  Well Tyke has to leave soon for the all-night party but after dinner his family went out to dinner and then he came home and didn't do anything.  But he did get an MP3 player so he has to decide if he wants that or not.  He hasn't made a definite decision yet actually.  It would be cool to have one but Tyke doesn't think it suits him as well as others who have one.  Well for you non-seniors out there have fun not being at the party tonight.  HA!
