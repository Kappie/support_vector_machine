Well first off, we went to the convention center around 6:30ish...then we found out that were suppose to play at 3:00 p.m...so yeah...i jus woke up at 6:00 for nothing, w/e though, thats life. So we stayed there for a lil bit, i talked to jon mason for a bit and then we jus jammed...we went back to the hotel, and i took a nap and it felt hella good. So anyways on to our 1st match; we played the 4th seeded team called beach boys...we lost the match cuz i guess we were tired and we were jus out of it as alwayz...then our 2nd match was against mPower...yes...mPower...the 1st match we won 25-20, then the 2nd game we lost 23-25...then the 3rd game, we won 15-13...i think it was one of the best matches we have ever played in, everyone was talkin and everyone was havin fun...it was pretty awesome...well that all went down the drain in the 3rd match against yucaipa...again...we lost in 2...it was lame...thats all i gots to say...so today was alright...cuz we won, and yeah. Then we went to jack in the box where the most funniest shit happens...ok, lemme tell u guyz about austin...they are a shit load of hobos/homeless ppl there...no joke, they freakin beg in the freeway or at a stop light...well here it goes, spencer(chris' bro) found a hobo sign in front of jack in the box. So he was jus standin outside lookin like a hobo and trippin everywhere...ppl were honkin at him, it was hiillllllarious. Then we all went out there and like beated him up infront of all the cars and stuff, and ppl were stoppin and lookin...this guy drove by to protect spencer...it was comedy...pictures will b shown on monday(if i feel like it)...then after that, we went back to our hotel...talked to stephanie, ran outside into the hallway in my underwear, only, and now im here...and that was my day...payce!
