Although, half of it is spent elsewhere, nevertheless, shit will be blown up for days. I have weekend plans with my Farrah-y-poo. I got to spar tonight, although I'm not sure if spar is the proper term. I only got to block, and what's sad, is that I still managed to hurt people. I got to see Farrah today as well. All in all, a decent week (Atleast so far.)
