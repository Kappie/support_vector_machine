Well here's what I can remember of it:  "it's better to eat shit and die then to grow wings and fly."  a biggie saying  Ok i'm gonna pimp out my car. I have rocky and pat (L) to help but i need yours! It's time to rise up and serve your country. Tell me any ideas. So far we think we're gonna get chritmas lights and put them in the shape of a 'B' on the top of my car ;-) oh yea! You Know It! YOU KNOW IT!  -mike
