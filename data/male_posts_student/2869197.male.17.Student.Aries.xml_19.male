God has some freekin' awesome path figured out for my life, whether I like it or not. But right now I don't see it. I'm going to college. Of that much, I am certain. Where? For what? That's the stinker. I've pretty much narrowed my dream colleges down to two: Oklahoma Wesleyan University and Calvin College. Calvin I've been to and OKWU I will go to at the end of March. Calvin is a more accepting quasi-liberal (in the sense of theology) college, while OKWU holds to a more conservative stance. Calvin is a huge, slightly expensive college with tons of possible majors, while OKWU is less expensive, about 1/8 in size, and a more limited selection. That set aside, if I go to Calvin, I would double major in Religion and Philosophy, then go on to graduate school to get something else, maybe a Masters in Divinity. Were I to go to OKWU, I would take the studies in the Persecuted Church major and either go to grad school or straight to the missions field. That's the other stinker. What is needed? Immediate action or higher education? My mom believes I don't need that grad schooling, but I don't know. And should I really go into Philosophy? What good will that do me in the field? Questions, Questions...  Debate Banquet is coming up. This is the culmination of all that was Debate this year. It was really fun and good last year. It is at Topo's this year, which means truly great food.
