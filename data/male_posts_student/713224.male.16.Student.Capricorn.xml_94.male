The discs come when netflix says they will and I can expect a very small gap between sending out the old ones and getting the new ones (2 days, one from the outggoing postbox to them and one from them to my mailbox). I also let a few friends add alot of good movies to my queue and cleaned it up again. At this point I would highly recommend netflix to anyone who wants to see some movies or expirement with different genres, or someone like me who lacks digital cable (thus no On-Demand), and who doesn't wanna stop by a movie store all the time to get movies. Netflix also seems like a great thing for me to use at school, always having a wealth of movies to watch at any given time without riding your bike downtown and having the hastle of opening an account at the local video store.
