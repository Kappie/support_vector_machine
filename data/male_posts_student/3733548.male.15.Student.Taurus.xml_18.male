Saturday night was the greatest. We had our first "youth whom are going into the ministry" small group meeting thing. it was bliss for me, I really needed something like that. We got to learn alot that night and share alot too (yes I did still mange to stick my fott in my mouth as always a few times). Today, was a fairly decent day, Matt kept me up til 3 the morning before church by playing music. as he always does before going off to bed, the only thing was was that I had my guitar out, so I'd hear a song and be like "I love that song, Ihave to learn it" so I would, so now I know 311 "Love Song" which is an awesome song to say the very least and I also know "Float On" by Modest Mouse. I learned more, but alas I am tired tongiht and I have since forgotten the songs, and Matt took the CD that I learned the songs from home. oh well! okaeday then. well we get to church and church stressed me out. i need to get ore sleep before church later on, i know this now. but it was awesome! there were quite a few people from Anna Maria Island down and it was great getting to see all them again, I even got to know that Ben and I are alot alike. Then, we went to a cookout thingy and it was goooood, I got to meet some new people, in particular, Kendra (i do hope that is the correct spelling) a friend of Amandas, she was quite cool. After the cookout thingy Adam, Matt, Lora and I returned to Adams house. Then, everyone but me went out to eat. and I did some latin and got to eventually talk to my BEST FRIEND Amanda which I enjoyed muchly. But just for a moment, let me deviate off to some "ranting" about my friend. I love my best friend (in a totally "friend manifesto" not a "more than friend manifesto") and she is in my opinion one of my my favorite people. we had a few moments today, but the most intriguing was when something was said about "a mission trip to go fishing" and she and I both, at the same time said "we would be fishers of.......fish!!" which was quite interesting. we have the whole "mental connection thing" goin on and we tend to sya the same things at thte same time, or finish each others sentences, which is cool. I would have a Best Friend no other way. In the great words of Lassie "WOOF! WOOF!"
