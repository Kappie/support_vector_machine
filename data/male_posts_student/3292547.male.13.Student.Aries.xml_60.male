Personally, her being 17 and losing stuff all the time, I wouldn't have given her it yet, but then again I'm not them.  I'm almost done with  A Crown of Swords . I'm on page 797 or 855, so there isn't much left until The Path of Daggers. I really haven't figured out what's with the title yet and why it's called that. I wish I did, but I guess I'll find out by the time I'm done. Maybe I'll be nice and tell you then....  On a side note: Only 1 more day until the template change. (As if it's really that big!). I've had this once since the beginning of the blog and now it's gonna get changed. I still haven't decided which one to go with, but I will soon enough, don't worry about that. I'm going more for the one of the right (# 565), but it might not be either of those by the time I'm done.
