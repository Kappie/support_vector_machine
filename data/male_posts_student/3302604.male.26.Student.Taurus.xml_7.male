I've got two essays due in on Friday and a test on Thursday and another on Friday. Aargh! Still, now that's all done I can kick back and relax. Oh, no I can't, because I haven't got any money until payday which is Friday. Still, there's a  urlLink Mr Scruff  gig on Friday night, whihc I'm trying to go to but since I don't get any money until then, I'll have to hope there's still tickets left on the door. F**k  Still, been watching the hockey recently. Getting down to the important part of the season and all the games are fantastic. It's just a shame that we only get coverage twice a week. Still, there's always internet highlights, after all I don't actually need to do any work between now and the end of June.  Have you noticed that when people try to annoy you just out of spite, it always comes straight back to them with interest. My boss' assistant tried to irritate me by giving me a stupid shift next week, which basicaly means I have to leave at the same time as normal but I won't get paid for it. However, she didn't realise that this left her in a hole ahving to run the shop on her own for a while and she had to come crawling back to me to ask me to help her out. Heh heh heh.  Here's hoping the weather lasts until I have time off  Jack
