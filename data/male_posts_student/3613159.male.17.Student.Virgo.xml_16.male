     
      Prepare your shoes not to  come back soon, prepare  your heart not to stop too  soon. You cannot walk with  us. One step inside doesn't  mean you understand, one  step inside doesn't mean I'm  yours. In your world my  feet are out of step, my  arms don't move, my hand  won't grab. I will never read   your stupid map, so don't  call me incomplete, you are  the freak.
