They almost passed the exam as they stood up against the opponents for 73 minutes but then Milan Baros sent the ball to the net equalizing the Latvians first half overtime goal.   The Czechs managed to get another goal pass the Latvian keeper five minutes before the end, securing an opening round victory. Latvia tried its best but that wasn't enough.  My Man of the Match: Karel Poborsky.
