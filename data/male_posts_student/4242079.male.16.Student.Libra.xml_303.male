I guess we could still eat pork, pork is probably still safe, until they come up with some sort of Pig Meningitis. And then maybe they'll move on to fish.   Once again, the human race has blown things totally out of proportion. Don't get me wrong, Bird Flu, though I don't know all of the details, appears to be a very lethel virus, but destroying thousands of chickens that may have come in contact with a bird that may have come in contact with a bird that may have come in contact with a bird that has tested positive for bird flu.
