Now, first and foremost, I have a very close group of friends. In fact, I've known some of these clowns before we were old enough to attend kindergarten, so we've grown to be  very  liberal with the pranking and smart-ass sass-mouth to one another. Naturally it's all in good fun, and if you can't mess around with your friends every once in a while, then who can you?  A rather large group of us had gathered for the evening at Bender's apartment in order to get "primed" before heading out to the bar. Being (what feels like life-long) University students, we've discovered it's far cheaper to have a few drinks before heading out on the town, where booze prices are even  more  dastardly than the liquor stores around campus. Most of these people were pressing pretty hard to head out to the bar, when quite frankly, the rest of us would have enjoyed staying in for the evening - probably in an attempt to master our inebriated  NHL 2004  skills.  Around midnight people started grabbing their jackets and filing out the door, no doubt in an attempt to herd us towards some God-awful dive that blared Top 40's week in and week out. Bender and I, however, had other plans. We held back, slowly getting ready while everyone else started leaving the apartment to wait around the corner for the elevator. We took so long, in fact, that they sent Ross back to grab us, but as soon as he opened the front door he saw the glimmer of mischief in our eyes.  Without even exchanging a word we bolted  the other way  down the hall to the stairwell, Ross in tow, and hurled ourselves down 8 flights of stairs, grabbing the railings and leaping to each landing. Now, Ross isn't exactly the most agile of men, and he did wipe out once or twice, but he made it out of the building with Bender and I, where we then proceeded to make our way to the Strath.  It was a brilliantly executed plan, and it was pulled off with  Splinter Cell -like efficiency - I guess all those hours logged on Gamecube finally paid off. And to the victors, of course, go all the spoils, for at the Strath we ran in to at least a dozen acquaintances who were more than happy to join us in our celebratory downing of $9.00 pitchers of draught. Cheers!    Currently: Editing tale for any intensely incriminating conjectures
