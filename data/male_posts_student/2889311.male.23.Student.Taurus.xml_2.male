To my disapointment the server was busy and I had to run to one of my frnz place to see the webcast. I just took a peek at the scorecard to see the status of the match on my way to my frnz place.    Pakistan, earlier in the afternoon mauled the Indian attack especially they were severe on beleaguered Balaji, who was woefully out of form in the earlier matches, Nehra too came in for some punishment. It was heartening to see Irfan continue the rich vein of form he showed in the earlier series. Considering the fact that he is till 19 his rapid raise to claim the position of the strike bowler of the team is astonishing. He had taken 3 wickets despite giving 50 odd runs. Sachin, the master bamboozled some stupid ass Pakistan batsman with his leg spinners to claim 3 wickets. But the score line made a sore reading for Indian fans (300-9 in 50 overs).     Chasing 301 against a lightning quick Pakistan pace attack was never going to be easy and very few teams have done that in the past. So the task was ominous and it needed some imagination from the batters to weather the initial storm when Akthar and Sami would be fuming. Shewag is one person who has defied every piece of cricketing logic and today was no different as he threw his wicket away in the same reckless fashion he flungs his bat. Someday he got to realize that he needs to mix caution with agression so that he can justify the loads of talent he got.      Sachin was going steady and Ganguly as usual was looking clumsy against sheer pace. In his usual inimical stance of getting his front foot stuck in the front of the wicket and his back foot straying across the stumps he survived few close LBW shouts but inbetween these inept moments he glaced few gorgeous strokes. Sachin was not in any murderous mood today but played the freaking fast deliveries with certain assurance.    There must have been gazillion instances in the past when Ganguly walked across his stumps and missed the line of the ball and got his bails dislodged and every time that happened millions of us have wished that the Captain learns not to make that stupid mistake again. But today was just another instance showing that Ganguly is indifferent to learning from past mistakes, he let a straight n quick delivery from Sami to crash into his middle after the ball brushed the pads on its way. I heaved a sigh thinking about how many times this has happened in the past. Before I could pull myself out of this disappointment Dravid came in and went out . Yuvraj flattered to deceive and Kaif ran himself out. Pathan showed why he is such a promising prospect for India, he followed Tendulkar's words religiously but then came the heart break. Tendulkar who was grafting till then decided to break the shackles only to slice the ball to the fielder inside the 15 yard circle. It was a sore moment and I just cannot take that Shoib Malik was being so lucky, he rode his luck to a scratchy 143 and then he bowled ok, but the writing was on the wall that today was his day and not even the genius of Tendulkar could spoil his party.    Tailenders embarrassed as usual in their attempt to deny Pakistan the bonus point. In the end, to much of the dressing room's relief they scampared to 241 but in the end it was Pakistan's pace that put paid to India's hopes of winning this match and extending the mental stronghold they have been holding over the past few months. So with this result its a do-or-die situation for India in the next match against Sri Lanka.    All in all this was yet another cricket match whose result again gave the much familiar gloom on a sombre sunday. Need to shake the rust off and get on with my thesis work in the forthcoming days.    Nothing more to add now,  Signing off,  Murali.
