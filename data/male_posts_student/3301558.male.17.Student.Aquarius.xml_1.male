Gloria,actually wasn't bad at all as a president..of course i wanted eddie V. to win..his a Christian and all.. but Gloria wasn't a bad president..she made many things..just imagine if gloria didn't win..the MRT from marikina to divisoria would be left hanging there..and the new government won't take action bout it at all...the wasted money...so please,don't feel bad that Gloria is still our president... just pray for the country and hope for the best!!! ryt?? wala lang po!! wahahahahaha!!!
