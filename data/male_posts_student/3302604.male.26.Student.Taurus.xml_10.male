I thought the war finished a year ago, but they still seem to be fighting. Almost makes you wander why they want to stay. Oh yeah, incidentally they haven't yet found Bin Laden either. Still, minor details.  Whenever I turn on the news these days I ama more amazed by the total shambles that's going on out there. It started as a mess with a pathetic excuse for them to go in there and now it is even worse. I mean, they haven't found Bin Laden and they only produce Hussein when the tide of public opinion is turning away from them so dramatically as to be a concern in an election year (whihc has nothing to do with it of course).  Talking about elections, it seems that there is a large threat to the civilised world from terrorists. Apparently there is a large threat to remove the incumbent president and fight against the saviour of humainty's good works. Nice touch that. If you are working to unseat George Bush (in an election year remember) then you can be classified as a terrorist or non- legal combatant (or something) and bunged away to rot. Isn't this known as a dictatorship, I must check my dictionary.  If this is all it takes call me a terrorist  Jack
