Something like: "Send us a healthy version of your favorite recipe, that includes Stonyfield Farms yogurt, and you can win a trip to a cooking school somewhere."  Which, of course, as I sat down in Constitutional Law class, got me thinking about the worst possible recipes I could think of that would incorporate yogurt.  A few ideas:  1. Veal Parmesan  Yogurt.  Cover the veal with cheese, tomato sauce, and three cups of yogurt, preferably strawberry-flavored, although lemon will work as well.  Bake in an oven until the yogurt turns brown.  2. Yogurt Shrimp Fried Rice.  In a wok, mix white rice, soy sauce, bits of scrambled egg, assorted vegetables, shrimp bits, and lots and lots of yogurt.  Stir-fry until well-mixed.  Add soy sauce to taste.   3. KFC+Y.  Buy a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Pour yogurt (again, fruit flavors work best) over the top.  Enjoy.  4. Tuna Salad, Yogurt-style.  Mix tuna salad as you might normally.  Instead of mayonnaise, use coffee-flavored yogurt.  Spread onto un-rolled fruit roll-ups.  Makes a delicious lunch.  5. Yogurt Cheez Doodles.  Dip Cheez Doodles in yogurt.  Enjoy.  Perhaps someone else has some better ideas.
