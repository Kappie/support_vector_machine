I was hoping that England could win a few more gold medals as they were not doing very well. Fortunately they won a few medals mainly in rowing and cycling. My parents went to a party so we all went to my cousin's place (my aunty and uncle also went to the party)  and for the first time ever our whole family slept over there. While my parents went to the party, my grandparents babysitted. They always make our time with them enjoyably. When my parents came back (at around midnight), I was trying to go to sleep but there was lots of talking and light so I couldn't go to sleep until 3am, which wass quite annoying. Anyway, our Saturday ws ok but not great.
