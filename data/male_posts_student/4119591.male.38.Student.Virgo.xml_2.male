The notice listed out how much money I've made over the years and how much of that was collected from me and my employers.  At the bottom, in bold, not-so-friendly letters it read:  Your estimated benefits are based on current law. Congress has made changes to the law in the past and can do so at any time. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2042, the payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 73 percent of scheduled benefits.  Let's see... I'll be in my mid-to-late-seventies in 2042. Kids will be playing their darned holographs too loud and no one will give me a place to sit on the space bus. To top it off, I'll have to use the money I've been shashing away since I was 25 because the money that has been taken from me since I was 15 will be exhausted.  Am I outraged? No. One of two things will happen, I'm guessing:   The next few generations yet to be born will be asked (or told) to support us Gen-Xers.   The next few generations yet to be born will get fed up with us old codgers and make us into house pets.   I don't care either way. As long as they turn their music down.
