But siguro it is not all that bad...the poems here (not all...mind you) are quite great and good reading...you see the drama in them that I never saw before in our high school Filipino readings which was basically centered on Hamaka...plus the plays (though long they are) are actually nice...well, Paraisong Parisukat was too damn...but they were...unlike Duplo (way back in panitikang tradisyunal)...  Then I thought and re-thought about my Lit paper which was due on Wednesday...the only story I have not read is Araby and it is too damn long that I decided to settle myself with Graffiti by Julio Cortazar and The Walk by Joy Dayrit (which I chose over The Virgin by Kerima Polotan)...  The Graffiti is a unique story, mainly because it uses the second-person point of view...since the mode of narration is different, it creates this certain "excitement" in the readers (well, to me at least) and makes them go for more...  I still have not though about our report though, sorry Group 1...I'll just ask them for the stuff...  I have to go read some stories pa...I just hope that Salazar will just ask us to write stuff about the stories (panitikan) in general and not as specific stories...(conflict between kolektibong identidad and personal na identidad)...  And the thing about eroticism is it dramatizes the modern concept of sex (read: modern...postmodern is different in terms of critical theory)...  Damn! I am a Physics major and yet I find a growing interest in this stuff...hehehe...   --Pulotgata ni Danton Remoto--
