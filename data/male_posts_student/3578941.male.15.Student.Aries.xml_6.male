It wasn't that bad because I had some family over and like two nights ago I spent the night at seth's house and he spending the night here tonight so I am gunna have something to do so yay.  Also I have been planning some pranks for a mission trip called Passport I am going to in 3 1/2 weeks.  It's pretty fun and every year me, my brother, and normally kyle stark plan a few pranks to pull on our youth leader Pat.  Last year we tried to feed him a piece of cake full of exlax, he didn't eat it :( but we did hit him with a few water balloons, so if you have any pranks just leave them as a comment and I will read them and might use them.  Uhhh I haven't really done anything the past week and except I went to Chronicals of Riddick (dunno how to spell it) with my brother, chris, ryan, and eric heyen.  It was a great movie, I advise ya'll to see it.  Well I am going to surf the web while waiting for seth to get here, so ttyl I, right stuff when ever I can.
