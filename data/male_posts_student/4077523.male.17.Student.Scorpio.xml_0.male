And they are:     urlLink  http://www.waitallday.com/    ahhh...waitallday.com, I think the name pretty much says it all. I wasn't about to wait though. I don't know why I put this, maybe I can use it to trick someone or something.    urlLink  http://www.bored.com/    I got bored with it.    urlLink  http://www.i-am-bored.com/    is better than   urlLink  http://www.bored.com/     urlLink  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/    I have fun messing with the sound boards on this site but just for warning, there will be some choice words on some of them.    And Best for Last.....(drum roll).....   urlLink  http://www.homestarrunner.com/    I like this site the best. Plenty to do.     I guess that is it for the Rainy Day Review, I should have more and better sites for next month, or next time it rains here. Peace!
