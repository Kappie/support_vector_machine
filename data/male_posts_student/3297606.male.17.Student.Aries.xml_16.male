I dedicate this website to Hands Down Henrel, a dear friend of mine who died processing meat in Belgium.  So yea, I just got back from Poker Night, which has transformed to more of just "do whatever night." fun stuff it is. Whenever me and Jon get together its like "movie mode," at least a million years is spent going over possible shots that we can get and stuff.  so on to the interesting stuff:  today at school ben got his head lobbed off, but it turned out fine, with a little rest he should be back up in no time. We still havent figured out who did it, but when we do, off with their pelvis. After school Jon and Mike came over and we found six naked trible leaders in my sisters closet, when we asked her what they were she lifted he hands, palms out, and spread apart, then put back together her fingers in a looping fast like motion. Shes been doing it ever since (523 years).  oh, mike went on a mission and completed 3 objectives in 17:33. but me and jon were down watching the last samurai, so when he reached HQ he couldnt find a way in and we couldnt hear him knowcking, so he climbed down a hole in my driveway and started banging on an underground window, and when i pulled away the curtains he yelled "bunt!" (the funny thing is this is completely true)  im still figuring out this blog thing so bare with me... (bare meaning naked)
