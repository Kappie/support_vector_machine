I played volleyball at the beach;. Saturday i played at a block, and i hurted my knee, and today i had to jump for getting the ball and my knee started bleeding, It's ok now. My brother just went to the videostore, he'll rent "monsters SA", hummm... i don't know. I wanna rent "Frida", i like her a lot. I didn't pay attention, and the sun burned all of me, I hope not to wake up with that hurt tomorrow morning.   P.S: hugs to Ron and Robin, who told me, they read my blog!!!
