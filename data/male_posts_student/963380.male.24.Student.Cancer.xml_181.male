He didn't look me in the eyes once today, just went about his shit, moping, grumping and generally acting like a complete dick. Mike taunted him a little, which is akin to headbutting a jellyfish - I was shocked he didn't get stung.  I didn't get a joke today - which illustrated just how much I need sleep. I've been sleeping really badly over the past few days. That blows.  I feel physically bad, but mentally good. It's a weird fucked up place to be.  Maybe I'll come visit YOU.
