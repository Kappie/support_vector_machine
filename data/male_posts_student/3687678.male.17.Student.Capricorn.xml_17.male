On every news channel, all they are talking about is politics. Don't get me wrong, politics can be a very good thing because it what makes America great.    Jay Leno hit it on the nail when he was talking about how the election will not be delayed if there was a terrorist attack. Leno stated that they should just have the election today and get it over with. I agree, this year's political atmosphere is sickening. All that I see from all parties whether they be Democrat, Republican, or Independent, is mudslinging. The candidates are focused on downing the other guy that I can't figure out what their goals are.    I want to know what a candidate can do for our country not what the other guy can't do. Put your seat belts on because from now until November, it is going to be one wild ride. All anyone will hear is politics. Don't let it get in your way and more importantly don't let it ruin relationships.
