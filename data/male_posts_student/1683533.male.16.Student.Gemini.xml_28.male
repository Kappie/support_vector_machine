It is an enhanced CD that included a preview of movie called Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election.  This preview shocked me because it gave evidence of the election being a scam.  That Bush cheated in winning, and other injustices, here is what I got from that preview:  *Thousands of ballots were purged because they accused some of the people being criminals, but in each county of Florida, at least 15% percent of the people were innocent of any crime.  That is 1,000 voters.  Half of them were black, and 93% of black voters voted for Al Gore.  You do the arithmetic....there’s the presidency.  *Of 6,137,938 ballots cast in Florida, Bush was still ahead by 1784 votes, and on November the 10th it was announced that Duval county in Florida, 27,000 ballots were thrown out.  16,000 of them were from places that voted 98% democratic.  *Manuel recounts have been done thousands of times and have been known to be more accurate than machines.  A bush spokesperson, James A. Baker III, came on before the manual recount and said “The nation [should] leave manual counting because it was more prone to human error or mischief.”  The Republicans did everything they could to stop the manual recount, a demonstration was led to stop the manual recount.  Can you guess who led it?  National Republicans.  * On December 8th,The Florida Supreme Court ordered all of votes not picked up by the voting machines be recounted.  The next day the recount started.  A couple hours later Bush’s supporters stopped the recount.  The Supreme Court turned a blind eye to the actual disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters.  *The Florida Supreme Court had a governing principle for 75 years: “The intent of the voter prevails over technicalities.”  They completely ignored  it; they made believe it didn’t exist.  Vincent Bugliosi, an author, said, “In a fair world, these five people [Florida Supreme court], and I am going to say this with every fiber of my being... These people are criminals in the true sense of the word .”  To buy the full length video of Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election or see the preview I saw, goto  urlLink www.unprecedented.org  or buy NOFX's new cd War on Errorism, which you should get anyway because it is sweet.
