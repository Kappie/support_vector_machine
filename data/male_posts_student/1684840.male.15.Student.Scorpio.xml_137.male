Babysat and watched Bad Girls 1/3 with Tanya in it from Footballers' Wives (totally quiet for a change!) and Eastenders and Corrie etc.  I rushed my French hw and sat on my PC for a bit, and then got into bed listening to the Late Show on BBC Radio Stoke.  Woke up as normal this morning.  My Lost Prophets CD came in the post (and is really cool I must say).  It is bloody sunny again (but not as hot, thank thee lord)  Anyways, now school.  French was utterly boring and Frenchie was too.  A breif summary of those lessons would be:  Coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, coursework, and coursework (to be precise).  Brannan shocked the life out of us all by announcing that he had managed to hack into the school system.  I really doubted it at first but I gave him a chance.  We did something about leaves in Biology and then looked at settlements and stuff in Geography.  Afterwards we went to thelibrary so James could show us his little hacking trick... which was a complete farse.  It turned out he couldn't hack into the system (suprise suprise) and made a bit of a fool of himself to be honest.  I suppose it might be impossible since all of the accounts are from a mapped network drive which requires a specific user to access (from an admin terminal of course).  I heard from the lunchtime goers that a man went mad in Tesco when he wasn't being served (most people wait in the cues?!), but this man was different.  He went mad and what happened next could best be described as 'Sandwich Terrorism'.  He threw his sandwich which he was about to purchase at the person on the tills and stormed off cursing about school kids or something.  Must be that time of the month...  After lunch I went to the RE death discussion thing.  It was a lot different from what I expected it to be; it was in fact quite interesting.  The funeral director bloke from over the road came in to chat to us about funerals and death and stuff (mostly about how funerals were conducted etc.) and half way through something HILARIOUS happened!  Sean who was sitting right beside moi, was groping a yoghurt pot, which Richard Holland, sitting right in from of moi, decided to turn around and grab it out of his hand.  Before we knew what was happening, the yoghut pot burst and it went EVERYWHERE!  Poor Stuart, who was sitting right 'in the line of fire', got full blast of it and most of it hit the wall and blind behind us.  Everyone was laughing their heads off for ages and Miss. Oakley and the funeral director bloke stood there looking bewildered.  Great afternoon entertainment in my opinion!  Maths was the usual work, except near the end Mr. Salt did a sort of chicken dance to teach us the axis of the graphs we were drawing.  Assembly (with the oh so entertaining Mr. Rock) was a complete laugh and joke as usual... not!  All he did was natter on about coursework and exams.  Again, all I could think was "not me!" when he said things like: "You will be sitting here in 53 weeks doing these exams" lol.  Which reminds me... I want to go to America now!!!!  I'm starting to feel 'homesick' from America, which is quite odd really.  I just want to get back over there as soon as possible.  Bad Girls is on again tonight as part of this 3 part special with Tanya Turner in it, so I shall be retiring early to bed to watch that (after compelting my oh so precious Information Systems homework).  It's Becky's birthday soon so I'll make her something cool on flash to give her instead of a boring old card.  Buh Bye...
