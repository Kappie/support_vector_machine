Im really excited about it when I think about it but honestly, its not on my mind as much as you prolly would think it would be...my mind is thinking about so much else that is going on RIGHT now in my life that i really havent had time to think about it....and i guess thats why all of the sudden it has hit me that I wont really be home and be able to do much until July 10th because right after I get back on the 28th of June, I leave for Colorodo July 3rd...so yeah....and i guess today it really hit home today that im not gonna be home for a whole month...eh, things will be alright.  I sure hope nothing changes too much while im gone...im really liking what is going on right now in my life.  My relationship with Meeta is really great and has really gotten good ever since school let out cause now I see her every day and has been such a relife to have something to look forward to every day....its been really great....  Things with my younger brother have really gotten better too...there was a time where i thought that all he did was hate me and didnt even want me a part of his life but the past week or so he has really opened up and let me back in his life and let me try to be the older brother that i am supposed to be.  And as I said in the entry before, things with Kimmy got so much better Friday night cause i actually went over and told her how i felt and we just talked things out.  Amazing what one night can do to a great friendship that i hope to god i never loose....  So tonight was Christinas b-day thing (I dont know how to spell what its called lol) and it actually was a lot of fun.  I wanted to go to the church thing that started it off but my ride (Meeta) did not but being the person that she is decided to come with me =)...that made me really happy because throughout the whole thing i sensed that she was not enjoying it but she still came and did it for me....I really commend her for that.  I dont know if I could do that for anyone (but maybe her =)  The rest of the night went really well and was a lot of fun.  The food was AWESOME and the dancing was really fun too.  After that me and Meeta came back to my place and watched a lil hockey (again, I commend her because even though she does not like hockey she sat there and watched a whole period just cause she knew I wanted to =) then Monster Inc. (a movie she had never seen!!)  So yeah the night was great!  So yeah just 4 more days and Im gone....but ive already talked about this....up there...lol  So yeah, Im extremely exhausted and I am gong to make a early night (for me) of it.....lata days.....
