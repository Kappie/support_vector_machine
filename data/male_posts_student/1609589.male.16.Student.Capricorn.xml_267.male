My brother's an ass, My friends wont quit being shits just because they outnumber the whiteys now, my parents are being uptight, Ms. Welch is an evil whore who should die, and to top it all off, one of my drumsticks broke(not that big a deal, in fact it was kinda funny).  If it weren't for like 3 people "understanding" the shit that happens that  I complain about, I don't know what I'd be doing.  First off, everybody has decided to argue with me over aim, instead of not being a wussy and confronting me in real life. What gives? I think they're afraid of me. They can sit in their comfortable chair planning out what theyre going to say, where nothing I can say or do can hurt them. It's happened this way ever since the "Christian Wars" as I am now referring to them, where everyone in middle school found out I was athiest and decided that it was their destiny to convert me. None of them succeeded.  Oh well. I guess I have to live with everyone being a complete wussy.  Now my friend's lied to me, and I've had to deal with his shit for the past couple weeks now. He used to be cool, too, but then he decided sometime last year he was gonna become an asshole and take everyone down with him. So today he took this bouncy ball I had and lied and said he didn't have it. Now, the bouncy ball doesnt mean shit to me, it's that he lied to me for no apparent reason.  he's said he's sorry, and says that if he wants us to "go our separate ways" after he gives the ball back, that's cool with him. I don't even know if I want to or not, I'm just so physically and emotionally tired after this week, I just don't know.  Hopefully Movie night will be good, even though I don't know how much I'll like sitting through a bunch of "independent" films(the ones from IFC from spoiled kids that are bored and make movies) all night. I suppose there's always tag.
