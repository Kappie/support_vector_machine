See my little sis be a super-star in a high school waterpolo game or swim meet.  4. Do a Triathalon, maybe Ironman. 5. Go streaking on a cold night. 6. Be an effective teacher or whatever I'm meant to do with my life. 7. Watch "Chariots of Fire". 8. Visit the Subway Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. 9. Go to a Super Bowl (Hopefully with the 49ers playing in it) 10. Share Christ with BOLDNESS with more people, but not while streaking.
