Well, that is what people tell us.  We're both very interested in blogging, and decided to start up a joint blog again, because the last one we had was a lot of fun, and helped spark many interesting conversations.. Or something like that! I will now turn the ol' post editor over to 'im now... Until later, adieu.    Salutations, viewers.  As  urlLink Kevin  said above, my name is  urlLink Bob Evans .  I enjoy blogging very much and have been doing it for almost as long as Kevin has.  Does that make me good? Not necessarily.  Does it lose it's excitement after a while? Hell, no.  Are we gonna give ya some good content in this bad boy? You betcha.  But that's all I've got for now.  Exeunt.
