So my trip plans are confirmed now. Andrea and I reserved the hotel last night through Expedia and we are hitting up Winnipeg on July 23rd. We are going to stay there the weekend and come back Monday the 26th. I am pretty pumped, I am going to do some shopping and roaming around. I also get to see some people I haven't seen for awhile as well. It will be nice to relax and get away! I plan to be on the road at about 5am, road trips are so fun.   I downloaded a bunch of new Janet Jackson songs off of her new album Damita Jo. The songs are awesome. I am going to buy the CD soon.   I wrote another poem today, entitled "Assurance". It has to do with instability of the mind being able to be controlled. Enjoy.   Assurance   Productive outcomes, Sinful thought, Inspirational genious, Yet had to be taught  Firm grasp on reality, Shunning from the past, Helping the matter, Can resolve this at last  Lost and alone, Yet surrounded by everyone, Feelings of dismay, Weigh upon my back a tonne  A hierarchy of madness, Harmonious acts of discretion Setting the bar where its needed Organizing each thought in its section  Intricate formulas, Alluding the rest Attempting to give, Showing your best  Freedom to roam, Pressure of my life Swaying back and forth Cutting, like the blade of a knife  Regretting what is past, Concentrating on the future Throw away the pessimistic views, Then truly, can yourself assure.  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk  And so you have it. Another day gone, a new day to start. Seems to me that life goes by so fast. Time rushes like it is out of style. *Sigh*  I have posted my poems in an online portfolio, if you want to check them all out visit  urlLink this page    .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Until later, take it easy.
