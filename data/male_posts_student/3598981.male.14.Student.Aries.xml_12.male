(just for ASH - The Small Hand points to the 9 and the Big hand points to nearly 8 :D)  Last Song Listened to - "There Is A Higher Throne." Its a great song!  Last Thought - What can I have for supper?  Day out of 10 - 6/10. Ash and Phil made it far better at the end, Thanx guys!  Last Site (Apart from Blogger.) - My Home Page  Most funny thing all day - looking at past pics of saturday. (GREaT DAY!) and having a joint convo with ash and phil - snotty tissue LOL!  Most upsetting + annoying thing all day - SCHOOL. IMAKILLU. was very depressing!  Thing I cant wait to do - I cant wait to go to YF to c everyone and cant wait till saturday for more fun.  Thing i am dreading to do - french vocab, school 2morrow and monday, but as ASH said "Only 2 weeks left!" and "people in your school r all gay!"  Most helpful bible Verse today - Isaiah 40:31  Well that about it for me 2day  Night Night all, even though it isnt dark.  Bi  Dave
