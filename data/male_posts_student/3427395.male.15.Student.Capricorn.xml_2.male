Is there a formula for falling in love? It just happens and you can't resist it. My friend told me she was in love today, said she fell in love over the phone. I think it's possible.....love at first hearing. Maybe. Am I rambling? Oh Well, what can you do?   I was thinking about religion too. There is no way to explain the universe, no way that's 100% foolproof, so why try? Just accept it as it comes. The religions are trying to put a constraint on why things were created. I am personally an agnostic, which means that I believe in a 'greater force', some sort of god, but I'm not trying to find out what it is or why we are here.  Think about how big the universe is and how small the earth is. It is 99.9% probable that life other than humans exist. Why do we think we're so special.  Some advice to finish off: 1. Never ever dwell in the past, what good's it doing thinking about what has already passed? 2. Don't think to the future too much either, no more than a couple of weeks, because so many things are undecided and can change the course of events. If you plan and something happens you'll be dissapointed.  3. Love and be loved. Talk to everyone. Be friendly and generous.  If everyone followed these three things the world may be a better place.
