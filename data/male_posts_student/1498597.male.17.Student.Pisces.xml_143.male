Thank you  Nick  for "peer editing" my previous blog and noticing that I had double posted.  Since I am still very new to bloggin' and am known to be prone to make mistakes, I have to keep watch for any more mishaps!  Isn't it ironic that the blog I make a mistake on begins with the "Waging the war on errorism..." and I go and make an error!?  Well, I didn't mean errors of the gramatical kind, but rather the errors committed by our beloved American government.  If you are wonderin' where I got that catchy little phrase "war on errorism", I got it from the newest CD released by  NOFX  called (you guessed it)  "The War On Errorism" .  For the title of my blog, I took the name  "Punk Rock Editorial"  from the weekly e-mail I get from infamous punk label,  Epitaph .  How I trample on copyright laws!  Well, I see it as a tribute toward punk rock by doin' so.  Anyway, I noticed in  Nick's blog  that he sang some sappy patriotic country song...well bein' a punk, I don't have a particular likin' to country music....oh ok I hate the damn shit and it annoys me.  Now I know yer thinkin' I should be a little bit more sensitive to  Nick's  feelings (which I am not tryin' to hurt in anyway at all and he knows it too), but one of the reasons I started to type this blog is that I reserve the right to state my opinion to the public.  Now, I'm not someone who goes around shovin' their opinions in people's faces or insist that my opinion is more correct or valid than theirs and force them to change their points of view.  Even if I hold my opinion higher than anyone else's does not make me automatically right....or any other person for that matter.  An example of the "I-must-force-my-opinion-on-you" type of person is a Mormon.  They're always goin' around on their bikes, dressed in their little suits, goin' door-to-door with their "Book of Mormon" (which should be more appropriately named "firewood") and try to make you a believer or convert you by shovin' their religion in your face.  Now is that offensive or what?  I mean, come on...!  Now, I bet yer wonderin',"What makes you different from Mormons?  Here you are stating your opinions in clear view of the public...?"  That is when I would answer by sayin',"First off, the most apparent difference is that I'm NOT Mormon.  I was baptized Catholic, but have begun to question my faith and the existence of any higher power or deity or whatnot (Oh the side effects of punk rock!).  Secondly, Mormons go door-to-door.  Now the people on the other side of the door have the choice of answering, or not answering.  Some of you idiots open the door.  Some of you don't.  I'm not goin' door-to-door at all.  I'm not goin' in the middle of a crowd and shoutin' this...I am just typin' my opinion, and whoever has the chance to look at it is exposed to my opinion.  Its a choice you make to read this damn punk kid's opinions and ideas.  Lastly, I'm not forcing you to share the same opinion.  That'd be nice to know that there are people out there with similar opinions.  Fuck, I'm pretty sure there are.  But just because you read this does not mean you have to change your opinion to suit my standards.  Throughout this whole fuckin' blog, I have not made one implication to the reader that I would like them to forget all of their opinions, all of their ideas, and all of there thoughts and replace them with mine.  I mean what would the world be like where all people we're all the same?  It would be the shittiest place to live in.  Diversity.  Thats what makes this shithole a great, and at the same time terrible place to live.  Variety is the spice of life they say.  I think thats true."  That is what I would say.  I've been ramblin' on about what I think for awhile, so I think I'll give it a break.  But I just wanna say one thing.  I hope that what I just typed wasn't a waste of 30+ minutes of my life, cuz I'll be fuckin' pissed.  Someday I want to know that people actually are affected by what I think.  But I want their lettin' me influence them to be a choice they make themselves, and not somethin' they felt they were forced to do.  Well, thats my blog for now.  Damn this is gonna be long.  We'll see ya...More to come!
