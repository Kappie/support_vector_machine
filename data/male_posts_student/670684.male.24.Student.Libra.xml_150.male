Gibson is the author of the revolutionary postmodern novel  urlLink Neuromancer , which holds a dear place in my heart as the last book I started and didn't finish.  I don't know...it was well-written, but the years and years of hype from  urlLink Bryan Alexander  and the rest of the  urlLink Centenary English Cabal  led me to believe this book was the be-all, end-all of literature.  It wasn't.    When I first started at the  urlLink Undermain Theatre , Kat Owens asked me what my favorite plays were.  I referenced some Mamet, some Shakespeare, some Athol Fugard (at the time I had never read Wallace Shawn)...she was impressed, but asked what contemporary playwrights I liked.  Fugard wrote in the 80s, Mamet in the 70s...the only playwright who I knew was producing works in the 90s was Christopher Durang and Douglas Carter Beane, but neither of them really did it for me.  Kat figured as much, and chalked it up to Univesity Bias.  Her theory is that professors and institutions set a standard for excellence in the past; that way, we don't have to reference the future.  It's why there are so many English students studying Chaucer rather than Richard Powers; if Chaucer got it right, why bother moving ahead?  The theory can be applied to so many other entities...for a different time.    I don't know if anyone out there plays Spider Solitare on the Windows XP platform, but the game is unbelieveably addictave.  I used to play daily, and got to the point where I could play two suits and finish off one suit before beginning the second suit.  But studies and semblance of a social life got in the way.  Now that I've been on break and spending the majority of my time in front of my computer attempting to write, I've resated the addiction.  Last night I finished writing at 2:30 am.  I figured I'd get one quick win at Spider the way I play it (one suit completely before the other).  That didn't happen until 4:45.  The worst part was, I got in this habit of looping Survivor's  I Can't Hold Back  every time I'd lose.  The only thing wose than that is I used to really enjoy that song.
