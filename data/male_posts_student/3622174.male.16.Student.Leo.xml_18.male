The first download of the day I want to share with you guys is jetAudio.  Now, this isn't your regular, everyday media player.  Normally, your standard media players allow you to play only MP3s, only WMAs, or only .mov.  Well, that's not the case with jetAudio.  JetAudio lets you play all of those, and more.  Unlike MusicMatch, it's main competitor, JetAudio allows you to play an assortment of different files, eliminating the need for several different media players.  The player is compatible with formats such as MP3, MPEG, WMA, WMV, MOV, AVI, and many, many more, making it ideal for the person who has music in all different formats.  Plus, it's not a huge download file, so you'll save a lot of room on your hard drive for any other things you may want to download.    One awesome feature of jetAudio is that you can also convert your media files to other formats, so that if jetAudio doesn't support it (and there isn't too many formats it doesn't support), you can quickly convert it to one that you have.  jetAudio also comes with jetCast, which you use with your IP address to broadcast your own radio shows.  It is not difficult to use.  All you have to do is find your IP address, and make sure it is compatible, and the rest is just as easy as using jetAudio.    You can also burn CDS, rip CDs, manage playlists, and use the timers and alarms to wake you up in the morning.  This is definitely one awesome media player, and definitely worth giving it a patented   4.5 out of 5.
