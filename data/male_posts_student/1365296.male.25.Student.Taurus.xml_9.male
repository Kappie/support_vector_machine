If Kerry wins the presidential election it will be by a very narrow margin.  If Bush wins, it will be by a landslide.  This deserves qualification.  It all started when I began reading the first chapter of the above mentioned book.  It was detailing the 1852 presidential election between Whig candidate General Winfield Scott and Democratic candidate Franklin Pierce.  Essentially, the Whigs believed Scott had wide appeal.  Despite the resistance of the Free Soil Party and the nomination of their own candidate, as well as the defection of northern Whigs who were against the Compromise of 1850, the Whig leaders believed Scott was popular and would prove to be a significant challenger to Pierce.  Is this not the way the Democrats view Kerry?  Despite the defection of such Democrats as Senator Zell Miller, they continue to believe in Kerry's popularity and potential.  He is seen as a tough challenge for President Bush.  Despite this thought, however, the Whigs were well aware of the potential problems the defections could have.  In response they abandoned past nativist sentiments and attempted to appeal to Catholics and immigrants, especially the Irish and Germans.  This alienated many in the nativist wing.  Beyond this, however, was the fact that these groups the Whigs were pandering to were essentially Democrats.  They had voted Democratic in the past and were viewed by the Democratic Party as a solid bloc.  The Whig pandering concerned the Democrats, but not enough to actively do much to counter it.  I can see the same situation developing with the Kerry campaign.  We have a third party candidate that is a threat tot he Democrats, Ralph Nader.  According to all the polls, Nader commands a significant percentage of the vote.  Granted the election is still many months off, but his polling numbers are scaring the Democrats.  This is pushing Kerry not only to compete with Nader, but also to appeal to the moderate Republican element that has shown some concern about Bush.  The real question is whether this tactic will pay off.  In the end it failed for the Whigs, leading to the disaster that befell Scott.  While there are moderate Republicans who dislike Bush, only a small portion are truly vocal about their dislike (myself included).  Some are deadset against Bush and plan on voting for Kerry, but many (again, myself included) don't know who they will vote for.  Essentially Kerry and his people are attempting to pander to the vocal minority, assuming it represents the majority.  I'm not convinced.  I don't believe the majority of moderate Republicans are going to vote against Bush.  At the most they will be about evenly split between Kerry and President Bush.  This will not be enough to get Kerry elected.  Then there's the anti-Bush element that many Democrats insist is large.  I have seen nothing to support this.  It certainly appears that way when one watches the news.  They show protests of every kind, and there has been story after story about Michael Moore and his new "documentary".  But the Bush hatred is not there.  It remains contained in the far left.  Moderate Republicans don't feel any hatred towards President Bush even though they do disagree with many of his positions.  Even centrist Democrats don't feel the hatred despite wanting someone else to hold the office.  The only people who feel such hatred are the wild-eyed leftists who hate everyone who isn't them.  These are people who would be complaining and moaning regardless.  These are people who hate Republicans as a general rule.  They are professional protesters who's idea of a good time is walking down the street chanting, "Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho...."  Just like their mistake in believing a significant portion of moderate Republicans want President Bush out, the Democrats believe their anti-Bush allies represent a significant voting bloc.  The truth is that many in the anti-Bush crowd don't vote.  Either that or they vote third party.  For the Democrats to expect so much from this crowd is folly, and they may pay for their folly.  So how does it all break down?  If Kerry wins the election, not only will the electoral vote be very close but so will the popular vote.  If President Bush is reelected, it will be by a landslide in the electoral vote but fairly close in the popular vote.  When Scott lost to Pierce in 1852 he lost the electoral vote by a landslide, but lost the popular vote by only 200,000 votes.  But as we all know, in this country its all about the electoral vote.  No one pays much attention to the popular vote unless the loser of the electoral college has the most popular votes, such as in 2000.  Kerry is speeding towards disaster.  Everything is pointing to a disaster.  Unfortunately he's taking the Democratic Party with him.  But this is exactly what happens when your party has no leadership of any kind.  This is what the Whigs experienced in 1852, and it led to their demise.  It also led towards to formation of the Republican party, which proved victorious in congressional election only two years after its formation and would elect the greatest president this nation has ever known in 1860.
