Played soccer today man...it was bloody nasty...Beruangs and Helangites vs those Seladangs and Harimaus...damn nasty la the game...lost 4-3..damn haha..some Beruang guy kept handballing!haha..I had an AWFULLY EMBARASSING GAME!Always had trouble clearing,couldnt connect with the ball properly..and always let it slip thru..terrible..violent oso...I got runned over by Wai Luen and sufferd some pretty nasty cut on my left palm..Hafiz legs collided with mine really hard to him...Zainul ended up with some nasty cuts to after some huge collisian with some guy..after a while I got frustrated defending and left it to Ian Jim and Gavin at the back and I pushed foward heheh..started playing along the right wing with Chris and also has a central midfielder...almost turned into a Guily but nah..dumb Wei Jay Sern..my PERFECT LEFT FOOTED cross(how odd!got the ball up in the air with my left foot!)ok fine took a deflection off Wai Luen and went to him and the idiot sent it over the bar!hahahah dumb!  2. Ok slept during Thiru`s class...hahahahaahahahaha he said I was the only guy in the class who made it by sejarah the moment I woke up from sleeping and he didnt notice...what a STONER!then did nothing..played that hahaha kinda weird but filled with sick perverted influences murderd and detective..damn sick..got sexual abuse man,gig,pros,masturXXXXXXxx,damn sick man.Then ciaoed off...oh yeah lotta ppl went for BEP but I didnt!Why waste my money on a group i`m not a big fan of?Unless someone paid for me...  3. Wanted to go get my haircut but my aunty came by to give some fish thing her daughters boyfriend got fishing..and when she left it rained like crap!Worse rain and traffic jams in Kuala Lumpur this year at least!took my dad 2hours 2get home from the offcie..more even and he left at *gulp* 6pm????wtf????  4. So he finally got home and we left..thank god my driver was driving so he was faster thna my parents would ever have gone..made alot of detours cause of traffics jams caused my u know la the rain,rising river water levels...got there at 9:30pm!fuck!Luckily started late so missed the 1st HaLF HOUR!Bitch!!  5. Oh yeah now for the biggest thing almost!The perfomance!Had the rm227 thatwere like 5 or 6rows away from the stage on the left side of the hall..  Ok dunno what happens 1st half hour but its abt Tony Manero,a Brooklyn or something..yeah..painter living a humble life but spending all high dough on clothes and stuff and becomes a different on the dance floor basically..always at 2001 Odyssey knwona s the best dancer around...He appears or is at least in his parents eyes as someone with no hope and dispite getting a raise on his job for 4dollars,he is still laughed at..and in the meantime,his brother Frank decided to return home leaving the church as a priest and all..  He dumps almost his old dancing partner Annette pretty much as he eyes for Stephanie a good looking blonde dancer who as like him,is sought after as a dancer and bla but with no real education..he pretty much then gets her and gets her to take part in the 2001 Odyssey dance competion..they won it cause his friends rigged the vote but he gave the trophy to the 2nd placed Puerto Ricans who deserved it more than them...he feels like hes let everyone down..  His friend Bobby C. whos gotten his girlfriend pregnant climbs up the Brooklyn bridge and all and falls off after trying to show he wasnt a coward like everyone said he was cause u know..he bakced out of the gangs fight with some other guys..the ambulance sirens sounded and the next scene was him sitting at the park under the bridge thinking..Stephanie who he had a fight with on the 2001 night consoles him..finding him there after he said he goes there to think..with him quiting from his job to help her move to Manhattan,his best friend dying,losing the dance competion and his parents deeming him a failure hes broken just as was Bobby C singing 'Tragedy' earlier after no1 seemed to care for and about him..So they start singing and it seems to get better for him who then decided he will move to Manhattan as well!  Its then ended with like 3 or 4dances and then asking the crowd to stand up and started dancing..haha..MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!Then my driver came..we went home..wow..the view of KL from those elevated highways..very nice and Ampang-gy hehe..  Then went to Pelita for supper at like past midnight..met Francis..had of course Nasi Kandar ler..ehe..then balik at like 1am..hehehe then went online mocked Wei Ning and then had a bath at like 2am or so and slept at 3am..hehe..  I`ll never forget it!So what if I missed the 1st half an hour?Got to see the  Night Fever part which I was so happy they did it again!I`ll never forget it...the brilliant choreography..ground breaking!the costumes!the singing specially when the music left the scene..hehe..the backrounds...and the nail sound filled danced!that was my favorite!I always wear bellbottoms or boot-cuts these dayd but will wear ever more now hehe!now must get tight 70s clothes ;) hehehe! *strikes disco pose*  "Then I get that  Night fever,Night fever, We know how to do it..
