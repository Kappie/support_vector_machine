With that out of the way, lets continue...  Boy, do I hate mowing the grass.  After today, one would think that the entire lawn was covered in dog crap.  I think the mower must have ran over it about...a million times today.  Luckily, I have enough experience in these matters to avoid it all, though it was to close for comfort at times.  All in all, the lawn looks great now, if I do say so myself!  The one thing I like about mowing is the smell of freshly cut grass.  It ranks among my top three favorite smells (yeah, this a weird topic...deal with it).  My others would have to be lumber (you know, wood that has been cut) and gasoline.  This last one is kind of weird, but I really like the smell at the gas station when I pump gas (and you thought I couldn't get any stranger).  Later on today, I attended my sister's piano and voice recital, and I do have to say that some people should never sing...ever...for all of eternity.  Don't get me wrong, some people there were very good indeed, but others...no, absolutely no.  One thing that really gets on my nerves is people who think they can sing, brag about it, and in actuality, suck at it.  Don't you even hear yourself?  Boggles my mind.  I don't want to sound mean or anything (and I don't think I have because I didn't mention any names) but I think it had to be said.     I think it finally sunk in that its summer.  I took a really nice, long walk with my mom today around the neighborhood, well...not our neighborhood...but that doesn't really matter.  It was a nice none the less.  Then, when I got back, I spend an hour or two reading outside.  It was really, really nice...kind of buggy...but nice.  Then we ate outside for dinner, the first time this season, and it was again really, really nice.  I think I finally realize that it summer and I don't have to go to school!  Yippee!!  But that doesn't stop teachers from piling on the work, now does it?  I have four books to read for AP English. Oh, did I say books...I meant novels.  Yeah, that's right, novels.  Such classics as  Crime and Punishment  and  Brave New World  (which is incredible by the way...weird...but incredible).  Then, for AP Bio, I have read 7 or 8 chapters in the bio book.  If that doesn't sound like enough, the first three words of the summer assignment are, I quote, "Write a textbook."  Now, doesn't that sound fun?! Just let me enjoy my summer for crying out loud!    The best part of the day was after dinner.  I finally showed Europe pictures to my parents.  I went through Derek's pictures this time because they were all conveniently already on one CD (by the way, if anybody else for the Curboy Europe trip has pictures they would like to share and you have them on CD,  please  make me a copy.  My pictures came out really crappy and I have to use other people's now).  They really enjoyed it and asked a lot of good...and not so good...questions about the trip.  It felt so good to finally show those pictures and it really helped me to remember my trip.  Well, that brings the day to close and I have my first day of camp with those little brats...I mean...those little kids...shoot...tomorrow, so get off my property before I call the cops!  Out
