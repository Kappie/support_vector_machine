But there's no one who likes the PC who doesn't like Microsoft."  -- Bill Gates    The second question deals with the 'free' software movement, known as the  urlLink Open Source Software  (OSS) development (such as the Linux OS), as opposed to Microsoft's  urlLink Closed Source Software  (CSS) products. Is this simply a question of "who owns what, how and why"?    >>  My one word answer to that is  No . Its not simply a case of dealing with copyright issues and ownership of source code. This is a commonly asked question but is outside the scope of this blog (that's me: a true software engineer at heart), but I might take this up sometime later. If you are insanely curious,  urlLink this  page gives a good, brief overview on OSS and CSS in a nutshell. Any more than that, and it will be pushing this subject into technical territory, which even I haven't explored a whole lot. Suffice to say that Gates’ reaction to Sun’s Java Technology was:  "Anybody who thinks a little 9,000-line program that's distributed free and can be cloned by anyone is going to affect anything we do at Microsoft has his head screwed on wrong."  Its a pity that Gates’ attempted dig at Sun’s Java programming language was not only foolish, but Microsoft even had the audacity to come up with their own supposedly competitive version of a similar language called  C#  (pronounced C-sharp). No guesses as to who won the battle!    Are Microsoft's trials really fueled by plain envy? What has Capitalism and Ayn Rand philosophy got to do with software?    >>  This is by far the most controversial issue to have hit the software industry, more so after Microsoft's Anti-Trust cases over the years. It has spawned off a plethora of legal issues relating to the  American  approach of doing business and competing with others in the modern age. The  urlLink Ayn Rand Institute  for  urlLink The Microsoft Defense  and  urlLink The Center for the Advancement of Capitalism  have been the two most fervent supporters of Microsoft, and have backed Microsoft's business strategies and processes full throttle, challenging the supreme court on the anti-trust issues. Terming Microsoft as  America's persecuted minority  and blaming their competitors' actions as nothing but sheer  entrepeneurial envy , these defense organizations have accused the US government of carrying  false philosophic and economic ideas and of trampling on the rights of Microsoft .   Honestly, my gut feeling is that the picture at the Redmond based Microsoft is far from rosy. People can be blinded by philosophy. Its a cult following. Ayn Rand lived in a substitute world of her own. Her philosophy is close to being impractical in the 21st century where being as idealistic as her is not exactly the name of the game. The supposedly  unknown ideal  and philosophy is perfectly fine by me, as long as facts are separable from fiction. Not everything applies to the 21st century  real world , or else, why even call it as the  ideal ? Moreover, the institute believes that Microsoft was punished for being successful and for making products that people  want  to purchase. Everything is fine here, except for that italicized word.   The truth is, Microsoft never gave people the chance to decide what  they wanted . That was one of the many reasons why Netscape/AOL filed an anti-trust complaint against the company in 2002. Few people are aware that Netscape was the first to jump on the Internet bandwagon and to release their web browser. In fact the first  browser  that captured the imagination of the public was NCSA’s Mosaic, developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The developers of Mosaic went on to create Netscape. Mosaic was also the first to be available on Windows. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser to-date is based on Mosaic itself. There is a feeling in the open source community that Microsoft never innovates. It buys, imitates, or steals and makes things difficult for software developers, and thus eventually for users.  In the mid 90s Microsoft’s chief intent was to gain supremacy over the  browser  war between itself and Netscape’s Navigator. According to the complaint, Microsoft was not content to compete by attempting to offer a better product and persuading users to use its browser. It illegally exploited its monopoly power over Intel-compatible PC operating systems in order to undercut Netscape's ability to distribute their Navigator. Microsoft carried a series of anticompetitive and exclusionary acts so as to undermine Netscape's ability to grow into an alternative competitive platform. It forced Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to accept exclusionary license restrictions that caused them to stop dealing with Netscape and instead exclusively use Internet Explorer. The company threatened OEMs with loss of their licenses to the Windows operating system if they did not comply with these illegal provisions. Microsoft also coerced exclusionary dealing arrangements with Internet Access Providers and Internet Service Providers that limited Netscape's browser distribution.  Microsoft is even known to have forced Apple to replace Netscape as its default browser with Internet Explorer by threatening Apple with loss of the Macintosh Office application. It was clear that the purpose and effect of Microsoft’s anticompetitive and exclusionary campaign was to reduce Navigator's market share and viability so as to prevent Navigator from becoming a platform for software applications that could in turn, threaten Microsoft's Windows monopoly.  Simply put, vendors and customers did not have any other  choice  when selecting the OS and the Internet Applications. The package was thrust upon them. How then can the people decide what  they want ?  I have been more of a Windoze user all my life. Only in the last three years have I started appreciating Unix/Linux and Open Source Software. I still use Windows, and I won’t say I am a staunch Anti-MS person. Linux too has its share of bugs and has  some  way to go before it captures the desktop market. Morever OSS development has its own pros and cons. In the end, what we need is a secure, robust and supremely efficient computing environment. If you consider all the factors, nothing beats Linux. Traditionally regarded as clumsy, crude and extremely cryptic to work with, Linux seemed to be meant more for geeks. Slowly but surely, this has changed. Companies like RedHat, Mandrake and SuSe now distribute Linux versions that sport stunning graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and integrated development environments (IDEs), much more sleeker and smoother than a monotonous looking Windows GUI. Even five year olds will find it easy enough to handle.  Anything  that can be done on Windoze can be done on Linux too; in fact there is much more to it than any other OS. The good news is that companies like Dell now sell laptops pre-installed with Linux.  Go Linux! And don’t bother about philosophy for a while.
