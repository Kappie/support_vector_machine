I went to the mountains to get cool, not HOT. It was gross. Anywho…I am back now. I went to Wet n’ Wild yesterday. It was fun. I got hella sunburned though. That kinda sucks. Anywho… I guess that is all. I might be doing voice posts more, now that they are free. Those thingies are hella cool. But yeah.  Ronald Regan was laid to rest today. That was sad. It is my first, but not last, Presidential death and funeral. Mrs. Reagan looked sad and drained. I would be too if I had to mourn for a week. Gov. Arnold was at the burial in Cali. That was cool. Well I'm done.
