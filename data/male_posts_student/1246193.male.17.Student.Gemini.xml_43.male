Here is how I came to this  conclusion:       I woke up this morning and just had the general feeling that today wasn't going to be very good.  I got in my car this morning and my garage door opener wouldn't work.  I had to go inside, press the button, and then run under the closing door.  Nothing bad happened at school.  I come home from school and I went to type my English paper.  I wouldn't print and I don't know why.  I went downstairs to figure it out and it turns out the drivers aren't loaded.  Of course, I can't find the drivers to load them meaning that I can't print.  I saved it to a floppy disk; I will print it tomorrow.  I went to work.  A lady came in and handed me a ten, I entered it as a twenty on the computer but managed to give her the correct change.  So on the readout it looks like ten dollars is missing.  I wrote him a note and let's hope he doesn't think I stole ten dollars.  Sean Graham comes in and begins telling me about how school is pointless and he hated summer school.  Meanwhile, he is using the most atrocious language I have heard in years and I am thinking why do I care about his schooling? Later, a guy calls and says, and this is word for word,"I know the country club is for members only but can non-members play...no...So I can't play?...Are you a member?...no...Then you can only play if you are with a member...he hangs up.  I am washing a cart and the hose gets a kink in it. I pulled to undo the kink and the hose spun in my hands, this is a hose that doesn't turn off, and drenched me.  I park the last cart and realize there is a cart missing! I go to the pro shop and there isn't anyone signed up to be on the course with a cart.  I get ready to call my boss and a lady drives up, unloads her clubs, and parks the cart.  She didn't pay for it, nor did she tell me she was playing.  I go to park that cart and pull into the shed too quickly and run into the wall.  Oh well, no damage done.  I close up but the door won't lock and it took me five minutes to get my keys out of the door.  I go to my car and unlock it, open the door and the alarm goes off.  The alarm which I never armed in the first place! It took me ten minutes to remember how to disarm it because it is rather complicated and people are staring at me through the window in the bar.  I get home, finally, and what won't work.  That's right the garage door opener; I have to go to the front door.  The phone rings but the cordless phone isn't working so I run to another phone where the caller hangs up.  Could the day get any worse? Let's hope not.  So the question is:   Am I kind of psychic and knew the day was going to turn out crappy   OR!                                   Did I make the day crappy because I told myself it was going to be!
