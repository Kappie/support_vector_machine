The words "my source" had been floating around in my head as I was writing down my random thoughts. But I knew that "my source" was simply not going to fit into this first song so it needed a song of its own. When I was brainstorming lyrics for the verse of my first song (M.I.F.), I had written down "defender of justice and truth" and "protector of weak". I liked how that sounded and wondered how I could bridge that to "the source". Well, if God is the Defender, Protector, and the Source then there are no problems! I didn't want to make this one too complex. Some of the songs that have spoken to me the most have been only a verse and chorus.   One of the lines that changed was the 3rd line in each verse. "Lord unveil my eyes".. major snore I decided. It's been done too much. Plus, the verse and chorus still weren't tied together. "Lord, show me the source (of this love)" really gave the song a solid feel throughout. If I wanted to make either M.I.F. or My Source, the "faster" or more "upbeat" song, this would be it. I imagine distorted guitars and pounding drums everywhere! Picturing those ten thousand Acquire the Fire teens jumping up and down, singing of God, the source of all life and existence. See why I like it now?  After writing this one, I was mega mega pooped and my sudden burst of energy turned back into a sudden burst of sleep. No more songs for that night, but now I know that God will SPEAK loudly to me and I've got to be ready to jot those thoughts down. I imagine all of the "lost" songs that were never written. I've also realized through this how it's much easier to write the lyrics to a song and THEN compose the music to those words, rather than attempt to squeeze words into a preset bunch of music. Thanks God. Hoping to try these out really soon.  - J.J.
