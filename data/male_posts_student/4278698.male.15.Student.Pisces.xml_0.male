In that deep brown of your eyes      I can see for a second your mind,      Your thoughts, you feelings…      I can see your happiness and your sadness,      I can see the most frightening evil nightmares,      And those beautiful pink dreams…      I can see all the beauty of the world and      I feel small…      I can see all this just for a second, and then…      You blink, as you close your eyes you close your mind…
