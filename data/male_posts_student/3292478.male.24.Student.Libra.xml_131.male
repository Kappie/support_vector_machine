The sound was somewhat similar to that of  Screaming Trees  which can only be a good thing.  Briefly checking out the website there is a lot to be catching up on, and with the debut album,  Contraband , selling more first week copies in the US than any other rock album it seems the hype may actually be believeable.  Am now looking forward to wading through the music and video files available at the home site!
