It was such a success that I felt bad for the other candidates.   Then at the end of the day, I was inducted into the ARISTA National Honor Society, along with about 20 other kids.  We had to dress up for it and I felt pretty spiffy.  My mom came to see it.  That was nice. I've been invited to Columbia University tomorrow for Leadership Day.  I have to dress up for that too.  I'm missing the whole day and it makes me anxious because I don't want to miss any work.  Sure I'm an A student, but I dunno I guess I'm just being overly anxious.  Since I'm missing the whole day tomorrow I didn't crack open any books.  Instead I hung around my desk talking to people--wasting my time.  The only productive thing I did this afternoon was the desktop in the entry above this one.  I think it's the best I've ever made.  Anyways, I'm feeling pretty crappy right now.  I could have been studying for my SAT II or reading Hemingway but instead I pissed away my afternoon.  Maybe I'm too hard on myself, maybe I'm an idiot, who knows.  I think I'm gonna go to sleep now though.  When you're in a shitty mood, you want people to care but then you don't want them to approach you either.  So I guess I want to be left alone.
