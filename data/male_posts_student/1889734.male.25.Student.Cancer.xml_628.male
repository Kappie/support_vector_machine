My goal for the night was to engage in some stretching, sweat a lot, and go through the motions so as not to strain anything.    That covered the first five minutes.  As is the custom at most rinks, goalies play for free.  They were having a referee 'training' session for the upcoming league starting on Sunday, so most of those guys joined us a few minutes after we started.  There were a grand total of nine of us, with me being the only goalie.  I expected a higher turnout, but I later learned that this is the first open hockey session they've ever done, and the word hasn't really circulated yet.  With three rinks, I'm shocked to hear this.  The new gear worked quite well, but it's going to take me some time to adjust.  The flak vest is instantly appreciated, as I took some shots that would have stung me with the old gear.  The leg pads are going to take quite a bit of adjustment.  They are like playing with a trampoline; when I drop to my knees, I literally bounce.  And since they haven't been scuffed yet, they tend to stick to the play surface.  That's a bigger deal, since my lateral motion will suffer.  I made maybe three saves that required more than token effort.  The rest of the time, I played the shots, and let the close in fakes go by.  No sense in straining anything right off the bat.  After about an hour of play, I reverted to my orange cone impression, waving my hands at the puck as it went by, and not moving too much.  The exhaustion was remarkable.  It's been too long since I've done this, and I have a long way to go to return to my Central Arena days (if ever).  I quit about 30 minutes early, and the guys there were quite nice about it.  It's a bad sign when you have to stop half way through undressing, to take a rest.    I have another session on Tuesday, and then again on Wednesday, so the plan is to ramp it up and reach full play aggressiveness by Wednesday.  The league organizer asked me if I'd like to serve two teams this season, since they are short on goalies.  I agreed, but that was before the practice started.  Now I'm uncertain, but I'll foolishly agree and sufffer for it later.  More later....
