Tonight I went to a Harvard Law School Alumni Association event here in DC -- a speech by the new law school dean, a chance to see some classmates in the area, and what they called "substantial hors d'oeurves."  I figured that if I took a substantial amount of the substantial hors d'oeuvres, I'd be in good shape to save a substantial amount of money on dinner.  And two chicken skewers, five mini crab cakes, two mini mushroom things, a piece of mini bread, two mini cubes of cheese, a tiny little piece of smoked salmon, a cracker, a mini egg roll, and, inadvertently, three toothpicks, I'm pretty full.  Mission accomplished.  The event was pretty crowded -- perhaps 300 people, ranging in age from "in their 20s" to "born in the '20s."  There were a bunch of incoming 1Ls there -- I'm guessing the admissions people notified the people who got accepted of these events, and urged them to show up.  I feel a little bad for the one '06er who I ended up talking to for a little bit, just because I clearly wasn't the law school representative he was looking for.  HIM: "So, I see from your nametag you were just a 1L.  Did you like it?" ME: "Yeah, yeah, I really did." HIM: "So what are you doing for the summer?" ME: "[brief explanation of my summer split between two really non-legal jobs, relying for the tenth time this evening on the soundbite I practiced beforehand about my current job]" HIM: "It's that hard to get a law firm job for the summer?"  [If I'd tried to get a firm job this summer, I think that would have been mildly offensive.  But, no, at that point I simply started to realize what I have to say is of no interest to this guy.  Nevertheless...]  ME: "I didn't actually try.  I'm happy with what I got." HIM: "And they have to do with law school -- how?" ME: "They don't." HIM: "Why not?" ME: "Because I thought I'd try some stuff I'm really interested in." HIM: "Did most people find it as hard as you did to get a law firm job this summer?" ME: "Uh -- I didn't try.  But a lot of people did, and some got jobs." HIM: "At bad firms?" ME: "Excuse me?" HIM: "At bad firms." ME: "I don't know what the difference is.  Some got jobs with firms they really want to work at after graduation.  And some went to second-tier cities." HIM: "Like?" ME: "I don't know.  Columbus, St. Louis, Juneau." HIM: "Juneau?" ME: "No, I'm kidding." HIM: "I don't want to be a Supreme Court Clerk." ME: "Okay..." HIM: So I can probably just squeak by and still get a law firm job? ME: That's what I hear. HIM: Great. ME: Great. HIM: Is there anyone here you know who's working at firm this summer?" ME: Yes.  And then he kind of drifted away.  I feel bad I failed him in his quest to get some dirt on firms.  I had a small bout of uncontrollable laughter at one point during the Q session with the Dean.  Someone asked a question, which us young folks in the back couldn't hear, and she repeated what he'd asked: "The question -- the questioner said he's a trans---"  And at this point my brain filled in the rest of the word, and I thought it was really funny.  Obviously, the rest of the word wasn't "vestite."  It was "actional attorney."  And that's much less funny.  Tomorrow I'm going to a recruiting reception for a fairly high-profile law firm, hoping for more free food and perhaps a pen or t-shirt.  I'll keep you posted... :)
