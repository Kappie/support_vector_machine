The inevitable school end.  The school fail?  I wait quietly, though I feel like shouting.  No, I don't feel like shouting.  A voice shouts within me, screaming to be let out.  I am shouting.  How important is it?  No, really.  Why is it shouting?  It wants and end to this tired, old world.  This place of happiness and sadness and beauty and horror.  It wants a rest.  It wants to rest.  The voice feels ageless...  As if shouting for a time I cannot grasp or come close to if I try.  It makes me want to sleep...  Sleep.  School will come soon.  At once I dread the coming, yet long for it.  What does it mean?  Something about Pirates and Castles and Cave Drawings.  Why do these things seem closer to me right now than any school's halls do?  It feels as if...  They will return.  These signs of...  of something.  Until they do, I will be waiting.  No, the voice will wait, as I fulfill my own ventures and my own life and destiny.  -ArV
