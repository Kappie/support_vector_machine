So here is how it went...went to bed at 11 last night...got to sleep at 1...sucked...woke up at 5 and slept on and off till 7 which is when i got my ass out of bed.  Ate some waffles and then went to soccer...did the soccer thing and got home round 10:45...talked to some people...oh yeah, rescued a turtle on the highway on the way home...but got home.  Talked to some people, then tried to get some shut eye, went jank as shit and didnt get to sleep, barely even got comfertable...anyways.  Ate a good mix of fritos and ruffles (with ridges) BBQ chips...then had some strawberries in some water...then had the water.  Watched some crazy ass video that Zac suggested...but its all good.  Watched a few other, realized that Clay Aiken has one fucked up face...his ears are gargantain (dammit)...dont ask.  Talked to Zac for a while, then went to www.quizilla.? im not going to tell you if it is .com or not...dammit...well...www.quizilla.com...did some stupid quizzes and came up with that new GI Joe thing...haha...and oh yeah..."Im good for the army"...fuckers....
