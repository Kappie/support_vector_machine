Bill wouldn’t answer the question; Bill allowed that he would sacrifice his own life, but refused to answer the question directly.  Bill might have said, “Michael, I wouldn’t sacrifice my child if I knew that doing so would prevent a twenty megaton bomb from exploding in Manhattan. No parent would. I wouldn’t sacrifice my child for fighting forest fires in California; I wouldn’t sacrifice my child for the exploration of space; I would never willingly, knowingly sacrifice my child for any cause of any nature, however noble or worthwhile.  “But if my child were considering an honorable career with risk – a firefighter, an astronaut, a soldier – I would never stand in the way.”
