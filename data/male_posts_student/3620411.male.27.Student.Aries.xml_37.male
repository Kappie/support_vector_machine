I don't know the history about it. but i can say that it fun ridding on it and feeling hot also .. there is no airconditioning. Plus some foreigners are over charged. So if they asking more than  50 BAHT U CAN SAY IT'S EXPENSIVE.. nornally they go in a short distance anyways .. price starting for 20 baht (hardly can get that)..nornaly the charge about 40 bath for about 5 km.. urlLink     urlLink
