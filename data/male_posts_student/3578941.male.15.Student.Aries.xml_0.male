So i started workin on the house like a week ago, and i only have one half of one side done.  This is gunna take forever.  I have also put in about 6 hours scraping and primering, which means i still have to paint that whole side.  Some other news is a guy from my church called me yesterday wanting to know if i could help him bail hay (i think he is paying me) today somtime, he called like 2 hours ago saying we would do it at 5:30 p.m. if it was dry or tommorow at 2 if it was dry.  I sure hope it is wet today because then i could get one of my friends to help me tommorow seeing as today none of them could cause they all were doin stuff and if i dont do it today i just got screwed out of seeing spider man 2 which i really wanted to see and i think i am already screwed outa doin that cause the movie started like an hour ago and my bro and everybody eles left at 10 and i dont have to be there until 5:30 and they had to be back b4 4 because they had to work also...god damnit i just realized i got screwed!  Oh well, not the first time it's happened.  Nothing much has been happining here in small town p'burg except that i found out that my dad is driving 2 hours to missouri to smuggle some fireworkd back to us for the 4th YAY, i think it is supposed to be a suprise, so to my one and only reader chris, dont tell jake if u read this b4 u gotta work.  and to any other of my readers over the net, who dont know me but should, get to a bomb shelter quick because knowing me i am gunna blow up somtin big and mabey that might be the worls, or just illinois. and here are some lyrics to any guy who is having some girls troubles, i know i aint  So quiet. Another wasted night The television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  Closed lipped another goodnight kiss  is robbed of all its passion.  Your thrill  another time to slack  has left me feeling empty  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  I'll wait until tomorrow. Maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then. So what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you? This mood of yours is temporary. It seems worth the wait to see you smile again. Out of the corner of my eye won't be the only way you're looking at me then.  So quiet. Another wasted night the television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed.  Dashboard Confesional-Again I go unnoticed
