Scott wants me to mention it so I will... he asked what I consider to be an unfair question of me, but he asked it, so I have an honest response. He may not, it seems, have enjoyed my reply. However, he knows the subject would be one of as little movement as possible on my part, even were I in the position for movement to occur.  Really tired.  Might be getting a new trombone soon... yay!  I need to find an accompanist for next Thursday... eek. Help.  I'm on another course of antibiotics. If these have no effect, I'll have to have tests done on me. I don't want them. I want to be fit. In either sense of the word.  Mel said me and Scott were almost identical ^_^. She didn't use those words, but the general meaning was there ^_^. And she also doesn't think I'm gay ^_^. *adds her name to the ever-decreasing list*  Bob Geldof?
