When the son returns from his first lesson, the father asks, "So, what did you learn?" "Well, I learned the first five notes on the E string."  Next week, after the second lesson, the father again asks about the progress, and the son replies, "this time I learned the first five notes on the A string."  One week later, the son comes home far later than expected, smelling of cigarettes and beer. So the father asks, "hey, what happened in today's lesson?"  "Dad, I'm sorry but I couldn't make it to my lesson. I had a gig!"  Thanks to wavydavy at  urlLink www.veloriders.co.uk  for this one.  So why haven't I started gigging yet? I've been playing for almost 3 months in total now, and I'm getting alright. Bass players have the advantage of being able to stand at the back, and plug away at root notes on stage, so can get away with being crap. But nope, not me!!  I don't know why, and I don't really care, but for some reason, I can't do things badly. That's certainly not to say that I'm talented to some insane degree, or even just a little, because I'm not. I just have to point out that I cannot do anything in public unless I'm competent enough not to attract attention. I didn't even book a driving test until I was better than most of the people I know that had passed (I failed for a stupid mistake so you all know) and only played bass with more than a few people around after much practise, and far too many beers at a party.  Most people I hang around with don't care. Messing up in public isn't a big deal, even I don't think so when I do, but I don't give myself a chance to most of the time. Only one of my friends has ever seen me drive (and it was a huge embarrassment) and I was ridiculously shy at the shop where I work part-time until I knew everything there was to know about school uniforms and industrial clothing, incase I got something wrong.  I can't explain it, but I can't do anything unless I'm going to do it well. Maybe it's a bad thing, but I think it's good. I get really focused on trivial things, so end up getting all sorts of weird and wonderfull skills, and that can't be a problem, can it?  Today I was listening to Dashboard Confessional, specifically 'saints and sailors' and remember to breathe.  smile, it's better than nothing.  xx
