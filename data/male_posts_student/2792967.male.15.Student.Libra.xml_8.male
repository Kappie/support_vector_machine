I trust her judgement over anyone elses. She told me what she thought of Reegan, and I decided that I no longer want to go out with her. The Reegan I knew was nice, and I dont have any first hand experiance with the stuff Ella said, but I belive her. Its a real bummer though, It would have been cool. Anyway, she has promised to help me find a girlfriend :D. heh, anyway, thats what Ill be up to for the rest of the summer. Post later
