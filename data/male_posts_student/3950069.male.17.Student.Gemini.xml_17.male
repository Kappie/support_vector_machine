There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."       The Notebook   -Nicholas Sparks  I feel like I've fallen in love with  you , again. I used to sit by my window, look up to the stars and remember of the empty nights i've spent telling myself how much I've missed you; you were so near yet so far. I spent the past couple of days with you so close to me, I could always feel your hand wrapped around mine closely, you never left my side,  never . Knowing how fast time passes when we're together, cherishing the memories that are left everytime I send you back home, you leave me abound with happiness. And for a fleeting moment, a tiny wisp of time that hung in the air like fireflies in summer skies, I wondered if I'm in love with you again. There's just so much about you that I believe in, and in the morning when I think about everything, I think about  you .  Today wasn't much, school was alright for me but lesson was until 5. At least, I do believe I'm starting to grasp most of the concepts in C programming. That's all for school.  I met Diyana in the school canteen, we were both taking our meals and it definitely painted a smile on my face to see her again -smiles- I was reminded of a lot of things, secondary school, that was when I went through a  transition , the things I've weathered changed me. I do have good memories with Diyana with her; writing and passing around lil notes in class, phone chats about the Hiphop scene, our passion for stars and being good friends for our friends. I had a really great bunch of friends back then.  Sakinah  Del , the both of you were the Crazy Duo. remember? The both of you were always laughing and Del, you were the singing one -chuckles- Lit Camp is still etched deep inside of me, we spent the night together lying at the corridor listening to music on my Laptop, talking about so many things -sigh-  Suffian , bro, where are you now? I've missed you a lot. We never really got into the best start possible, but we still made it as friends and eventually brothers who really were there for one another didn't we? You were part of me, you often came to me asking me and confiding in me about your problems, relationships and studies. You looked great with your  Silat  moves and we used to talk about taking up  Muay Thai  Capoeira  together and you took your guitar with you wherever you went, I wish you could have taught me how to play the guitar -grins- I miss  Ana,  my sis. How we used to talk about so much trash and everytime you called me I was always gonna crap you up with everything corny and nothing useful. I miss  Gwen , she's the one who always had a joke ready for me, I guess that was where I usually got my crap as well. I miss 4F'03, I miss the whole Lit class, I miss  Ms Oniatta , I miss talking about the society, learning from  Mr Ghazali  about conspiracy theories and practically criticising the Singapore Education system in Singapore during CME lessons. I miss hanging around with mah buncha boys during recess at the shelter with  Sky, Edwin, Suff, Daniel  and so many of my other brothers. I miss  Nuha and Halimah , doing Lit Presentation Project with  Jeck Chuang, Dawn, Sofia and Ziyu  trying out skits and rehearsing out acts. I loved playing basketball with  Shirui, Desmond  and guys or soccer with my classmates under the sun. Its only now that I actually recognise that, I have in fact had a very good time back then despite the ocassional setback.  I'm just being   nostalgic  .  There's so much really, when I look back at what I have gone through the past 17 years and realise how much of a person i've grown into and there's so much more to learn ahead of me. There's quite a bit of positive energy running inside and through me, hopefully, it rubs off my friends, those who haven't had it easy recently.    Baby, Happy Anniversary (: You really made my day, simply by putting your hands around me and telling me, i'm everything you are to me. Everything.           ILOVEYOU
