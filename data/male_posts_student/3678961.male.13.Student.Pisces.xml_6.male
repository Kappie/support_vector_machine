Anyways, after wading through a cesspool of boredom this morning, I logged on to the  urlLink GameFAQs.com  message boards, and heard that you could get a free G-Mail account by signing up for a Blogger account. Man, was I pissed when I signed up for this free blogging service and get nothing in return, except the ability to take the first amendment to a whole new level.  So, now I'm trying to coerce one of the members at the message boards to invite me. Looks like I may have a chance with one person. Thus begins the quest to get mail with 1 GB of free space.
