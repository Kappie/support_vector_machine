Anyone who thinks they can do it better are welcome to try, and I'm sure they'll succeed.  I suck at this.  I'm no good.  If I could equate a smell to how badly I stink, it would be the middle of a sewer surrounded by skunks drinking curdled-past-expiration-date milk.  Please God, PLEASE!  Get me through this.  I know it will be great, in spite of me.  Please watch over us as we go through the show tomorrow morning and all week, and help ensure safety and peace amongst the company.  And give me patience.  With everyone... especially now that I've been running on very little sleep for the past three days... and I hope that people I may have talked to realize that I'm under a lot of pressure and frustrated, and aren't too hard on me for some way that I may have treated them.  I just want to do a good job, and have a little fun while doing it.  njbfdhgjb .... sorry, my head hit the keyboard, but I can't go to sleep because I don't think I'll wake up in time, or I won't be worth ANYthing.  ARGH!!!!!!!  Restless days, and sleepless nights.
