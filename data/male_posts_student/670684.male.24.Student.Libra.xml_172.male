Sherman's is one of my favorite places...a low-key Katz's, with comparable prices, larger plates, and better lox.  We ate on the patio and talked about life in Palm Springs, my sister's attempt at buying a house, and plans for the rest of my vacation with her (she loves plans).  The check came, and my grandmother tipped $3, less than the requisite 15%...for someone who experiences no economic hardships, it wasn't a glorious move.  The waitress came by, picked up the money, saw the tip, and thanked us greatly.  She looked at me and said  I've waited on you before .  It's quite possible, I said, I come into town twice a year.   Oh, wow...I thought it was a lot more recent.  How time flies.   I smiled, laughed, thanked her for her service.   You are so great to spend time with your grandmother...that is so kind.   I don't do well with flattery, so I tried to schlepp it off, saying it might have as much to do with the city as it did with my grandmother.   Poppycock!  You are a great boy.  More kids need to be like you.   She smiled and left, making sure that I would bring my grandmother back for another Sherman's feast next time I was in town.  Before the awkwardness wore off, my grandmother commented on the situation:   She really liked you, but she didn't even look at me!   So am I going steady with the waitress?  Her salad days are behind her...probably her entree days too.    When I think of Palm Springs, I think of two distinct times in two distinct places at two distinct points in the year.  One happened again today.  I went with Frank to the gym this afternoon...it's a bunch of geriatrics out there who go more to chat than to work out, and I know most of them, and we talk about what's new in school and life and with the family, and usually what's new with the girls (it's funny how far the phrase  you know  can take you with naked old me in the shower).  I pull 30 minutes on the bike, hit the upper body weight machines, and then get in the outdoor pool for a while.  The gym connects to the old Oasis Water Park, now a subsidary of Knotts Berry Farm.  I get in the pool, create a floatation device with several noodles, and lie down on the raft, head mostly in the water, listening to the jets of the pool and looking up at the sky.  After five or ten minutes, I look up at the mountain skyline, and then out at the folks at the water park, often trying to catch the bikini beauties floating in the lazy river (I truly believe that I'll meet my next serious girlfriend in a lazy river...only because I plan to spend as much time as I can in life immersed in whatever lazy river is available).  Then back to the pool and the raft and slowly floating around in the solitary water.  The view is spectacular, the sun cooks you a beautiful unhealthy golden brown, and nothing I know has ever brought me more relaxation.  Last summer, I lost 90 minutes in the pool doing this...never again have I matched that output, but only because I am looking for it.    I would be much more productive if, on a daily basis, someone reminded me of short film festivals.  Palm Springs puts on a great short film festival in August, something I always try to time my visits with.  Because of TIP, it's a no-go this year, only my second miss in seven years.  Thinking about it today, I found inspiration to write on some of my short subjects.  The goal is to get in this, have my work up for viewing for a public, hopefully get some people in the audience as excited about film as I get when I go.  Last year I saw UT alum Steve Collins' great short LONEYLAND featured there.  To make my own LONEYLAND, I need you all to pester me.  Or I need someone to horsewhip me.  Oral sex wouldn't hurt either.    Imagine getting oral sex because you asked for it on your blog.  And then as you write your blog.
