I have class at 12:00!  I'm a five minute walk, a half hour subway ride, a ten minute walk, and a 3 minute wait for the elevator from class.  get dressed.  stumble downstairs.  walk fast.  just make train.  everything takes much less time than i thought.  only 15 mins late for class.  and i had forgotten that the prof starts the class at 12:10 so he has time to eat lunch, making me only five mins late.  But like my football coach used to say, "if you're not five minutes early, you're already ten minutes late."  which I think means that as far as he's concerned I got to class sometime around thursday.
