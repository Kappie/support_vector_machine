My dad 'had' to come for some very odd reason. I knew something was going to go wrong with him and it did. He was arguing and being extremely annoying and torturing us. Then he started drinking and driving and it turned into hell. Finally after about 2 hours my mom drops his ass off in queens at his mothers.  After that me, my mother and david were driving. I wanted to go to roosevelt field mall, they wouldnt take me so all hell broke loose. She kept suggesting all these places that i did not wanna fucking go to. And it was just crazy. I got so fucking angry at her. The two of them really ruined my birthday completly. I ended up getting nothing at all and then she stopped and got me a cake...  We went home, ate the cake. Big fucking deal. Supposedly shes taking me out to the mall today which i know is going to be another lie. Just you watch...
