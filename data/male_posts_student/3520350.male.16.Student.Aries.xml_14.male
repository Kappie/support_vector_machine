It was 123 questions and Ii finished in 40 minutes. The next person after me was 30 minutes later. I always do scantrons that fast. The test was easy. Here's the hardest question off it "Are credit cards part of the money supply?" Anyone will tell you that the answer is no. That's how easy the test was. After we just talked. Our teacher, Mr. Campion, gave up one of those thanks-for-everything speeches, which unlike the others actually had some meaning to it. Then Dan Kurganoff, being the idiot that he is, asked Mr. Campion to arm-wrestle him. That took exactly four seconds. I'll upload the video on my website sometime soon. Then on the bus home I sat with Olya as usual, but as she was bringing a friend over 2 her house on the bus, we sat 3 to a seat, and we couldn't play chess as we usually did. That was somewhat sad. Now we wont get a chance to play till the beginning of the school year. Well if she continues practicing as much as she did this summer, and continues to improve at the same rate, she's had quite a good chance of beating me in the beginning of the year, so now I have to start practicing too, to avoid the embarrassment of being beaten in chess.  The rest of the summer will probably be work time. I've got a stack of books that I want to read; good thing that summer reading book is finally over! And we're going to Vegas and LA too. Hopefully there'll be something fun to do there. I have lots of work to do this summer. I have 3 custom program requests lying in my inbox, ranging in price from a few 100' to a few 1000's. Plus I've got to finally finish the program I've been working on for a while now:  PalmSFX, and release it.               Three weeks of summer left, and then I'm officially a senior. W00t W00t!               Well it's 1 AM here, so tome to go for a walk with the dog.
