I have a webpage, I have this, and I have secret writing projects that I like to work on. You'd think I might want to go into writing or journalism or something! The truth is: Its so hassling to update my site all the time and Im probably going to slow down a lot on it. I've fallen so far behind so that site might stay dormant. My writing projects are all past ideas of writing about my experiences.      The first story Im writing about is a touching one about how Carie, Chris, and I were great friends in Sixth Grade and we all went our seperate ways. I am far enough to where I was stealing her away from chris! Heheheh I was an evil little kid. I don't know how I'll end it (that relationship) because the original was just too boring. I think I've written a good 20 pages into it too so I think Im taking this one serious. I just need a good ending to go for. Tell me if you guys got any ideas!      I need a place for my thoughts that aren't on some purely public site! I mean I guess this is too, but only my friends will ever visit here. Only the friends that I think will be respectful of what I say that is. I haven't chosen the select few, but if you're reading this... you're one of them!
