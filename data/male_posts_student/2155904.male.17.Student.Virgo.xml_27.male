It was really boring as talking to his grandmother is sorta like listening to his grandmother until there is an ever so tiny hole in her speech and then he gets to throw in some idea.  And also she has ideas that he finds ridiculous but then again she is family.  Tyke left his Uncle's house at about 6:20 because 35 minutes earlier his mom said that they weren't going to be able to catch the 7:10 ferry and then since the next one didn't leave until 8:10 they might as well just wait longer to leave.  Of course this was a bad decision so even though they ended up leaving 35 minutes later than planned they still missed the ferry by just 6 minutes!!!  So they had to wait almost an hour just to catch the next ferry.  On driving home Tyke saw some wicked cool fog in the Bellevue, Eastgate, Issaquah area.  It was really cool looking.  Then he got home about 9 and right away left to go to Macaroon's house and Dr. Phil Lelee was there too.  They played Madden and it was really really fun.  He left at about midnight and then nobody was online so he went to bed.  It was fun listening to music all day but of course the music he was listening to reminded him of things he didn't really want to think about...
