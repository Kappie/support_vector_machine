We found two vending machines, we were going to buy them but our dads both disagreed. I got a cool issue of Nintendo Power yesterday, shows all the cool games coming up, there's a new James Bond coming out only it's third person view. Jimmy also showed me this thing in Montauk called "Camp Hero" which was a US Air Force Base but supposedly had to do with the same matters of Area 51... ya know, aliens, mind controlling, super mutated freaks, shit like that. Then I basically relaxed the rest of the night, this punishment turned out not so bad after all. Today I'm going to my cousins for my cousin Jenna's graduation party. I'm punished today also but it doesn't really count because I'm going to be gone at my cousins all day anyways. So I just say my punishment ended yesterday to make myself feel better. Right now it's it's 3:00 AM. Uh... I stayed up until 2:30 AM watching good movies, especially "Don't Say A Word." Good morals and shit. It's worse to watch a crime and do nothing then to commit the crime. What other movies... uh... I watched some MTV2 and Fuse, Wet Hot American Summer, and Livewire or something with aliens destroying our world.  Ok people, the party was awesome, hilarious and Dan's friends are cool. (Dan's my cousin) We talked alot about the Matrix. Ya, we set off a few car alarms, did matrix moves to each other in the pool, played Marco Polo (Chris Columbus) and basketball... and we had a shit load of laughter and fun. Ok later.  Oh yes... you see these little girls have been calling lately asking for Jessy... well they think they're pranking me... I ended up pranking them with special soundboards and I bet they won't call again which is kind of dissapointing because it's alot of fun, so whoever you are, keep calling, it keeps me happy. (= By the way, pranking is a man's job... not for girls at all, especially if they have annoying an voice of a 4 year old.
