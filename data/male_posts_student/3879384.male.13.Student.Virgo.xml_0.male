Alright anyways I was at my dad's this weekend and holy crap i had such a good time i learned alot about my dad that i didn't know before. He lives out of town in sioux falls. Anyways spent most of the weekend in a camper out in there backyard (hey you're thinking white trash i'm thinking nature) Anyways I got talking to my dad about how he used to tell us stories of when he was younger and he'd always say oh yes theres always stories that i'll tell you when you grow older... Well guess what it turns out i'm old enough. Whew I never knew my dad was so crazy i always knew he was a big biker guy back in the day (70's 80's and such) anyways yeah it turns out my dad was a very interesting fellow way back when.He had some very very interesting stories to tell me and such anyways.  Saturday I had my hair cut! I hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it! Now it's really short and guess what I HATE IT! now i have to wait another 6 months for it to get back to old curly length.^-^ and no i never got a perm. Hmm nothin really much more interesting happened this weekend. well i guess i might go work out a bit more because i was gotta get toned!
