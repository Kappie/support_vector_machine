I had a  very good  day with my community service over at White Stadium. Less kids, less whiners, less arguments. Worked well for all of us. Went to Ruggerio's (Italian resturant), but I didn't eat anything there; I'm staying away from food like that for a while. But I did buy a "Big Burst"....hell yeah :-p  Had a few nice tennis games, practiced with my colleague (I HAVE to get as good as him...it's my destiny! [not really] ). There's one very good camper that's with us, who has better swings than me; it's just that he can't get his big self across the field. He has the potential...he's like Mario Tennis's Wario. :-)  My tennis skills aren't up to par. I have the speed. I have some swings down. I need to keep myself from jumping (I jump on volley hits all the time), I need to continue practicing my serve, and I have to be able to receive faster hits. My backhands are usually better than my forehands. I can scurry quickly to a ball too, so I think I'm a pretty decent player at the moment. We'll see how it works out.  60 hours comes after tomorrow. I'm not going on Friday. There's two weeks before my cruise; those are optional weeks. I probably will return, even with the weirdo kids there.
