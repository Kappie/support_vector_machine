As usual there's really nothing to do, cause it's Connecticut. The boredom capitol of the world.  Something'll happen though.....I still hope. Recently I've been getting into Doom/Doom 2 mods, and I've been playing the game alot lately. Probably out of my boredom. It's still fun though.  Anyway, it's time to go sleep or play games or eat or something. Later.
