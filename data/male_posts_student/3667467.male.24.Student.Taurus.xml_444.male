Once in 2000 I saw them play in Cleveland and it was great. I also remember their performance at that 9/11 concert, which was friggin' awesome. So, therefore, nonetheless, in conclusion, vis a vis et cetera, I believe the Who are a great band live and an OK band on wax. Led Zeppelin were so much better.  The joke I made up about Reagan was that his Alzheimer's is so bad he doesn't even know he's dead. Which may or may not be funny. I have FOX News on to watch the motorcade, because I knew (and assumed correctly) that they'd show the whole bloody thing and the other networks would find real news to report. If a car's going less than 90 on a California freeway, three hours of video by helicopter is unneccessary. The smog is really hurting the view, too.
