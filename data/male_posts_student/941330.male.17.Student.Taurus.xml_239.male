I HATE BADMINTON. no i don't, i hate our team. not everybody, just the people that don't give a crap. we had 69 -- count 'em, s-i-x-t-y-n-i-n-e -- players today at our first "practice." where the fuck were you in october, you lazy cunts? all of a sudden they decide they want to flood the team and take up very precious space in our cabbage patch kid-sized gym with their utter void of passion for the sport? when they think badminton is the wussy girly spring sport and the easy way to get a varsity block? when they think all you have to do is stand around and hit a stupid cock -- oh, haha! he said cock! -- a few times to win? then of course, with all of this repressed anger i feel towards the idiots taking up our team's oxygen, at least i can look to the coach for reassurance and support, right? because our coach won't segregate the team into different skill levels without having even watching half the team play yet, right? because our coach won't favor the players he knows over the players that have actual skill, right? because our coach will actually get our team into shape and teach us fundamental techniques and demanding practice regimens during every practice, right? who the hell am i kidding. what the hell did i do to deserve this bullshit, did i kill the 73rd reincarnation of the dalai lama while finishing my weekly ant extermination in the front lawn? the world is a gaping vacuum of absolute sucktitude.
