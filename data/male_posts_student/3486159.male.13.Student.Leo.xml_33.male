So Ms. Prowse says: "That's what happens when you're such a big guy." And I obviously took that offensively... Thinking she called me fat... She explains to me that she didn't mean it and I insisted that it was fine. Later on she takes a dog biscuit and throws it at Eitan ordering him to eat it as a joke... I take it and I tell her: "Since I am sooo fat... I am going to eat the dog biscuit..." And she pleaded me not to but I almost did... Then we were quiet during something so Ms. Prowse took us to the Kwik-E-Mart... But... Instead of everyone getting a dollar to be quiet, I told her that I wanted two dollars if she wants me to forgive her. Haha, it worked.  I was rewarded for being fat with fattening foods. I'm a Fat Bastard.  Am I fat? Do I care? Do  you  care? I don't think I'm that fat but I don't care either... I think I am very muscular and handsome (and so does Ms. Prowse, she told me...)  Tomorrow we are going to Great America. Yay.  It's gonna suck though, for the most part...  People like Lucy K, Merav, Alex, Toby and Dylan would be like bragging about how much they know the place and all the attraction and be like: "Oooh... Let's go to "Top Gun" or "DropZone" as soon as we get there... Then in the end they'd be like "Well... I went on DropZone 14 times..." "Yeah, well... I went there 17!!" and it's gonna suck because of them. I personally love roller coasters and am not afraid to go on any of them, but if I hang around that crowd it'll convince ME to brag about that stuff and hate myself.  My mommy is coming... I am taking Toby, Noah and Evan in my car. I wish I had different people *cough* but it's fine I guess....  A propósito... ¿Usted todo sabía que sé español fluido?? ¿Usted no , usted? Pozo... Aquí estoy hablando español... La mayoría las muestras vendrán fuera de extraño, pero lo que.    Con mucho mucho amor y admiración,  Ohav
