There are people who make a living keeping track of this sadness, and they do it well.  Click  urlLink here  for my personal fave.    Too often though, the criticism is presented too abstractly, as a laundry list of programs and dollars.  An example of the kind of information that's all too often missing is found in a letter to the editor in today's     Richmond  [VA]  Times Dispatch  :   Editor, Times-Dispatch: Regarding the article, "Farmworker Program on Precarious Ground":  Federal programs that increase the self-sufficiency of America's poor often work behind the scenes in changing people's lives. Programs such as the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) are rarely publicized.  Dean Moore worked on a farm in the Shenandoah Valley earning $7,000 a year. Today, with NFJP's help, he is a truck driver who makes $2,300 per month and recently purchased his first home. Dinesha Ryan in Southside Virginia started working in tobacco at 14, and had earned just $810 when she enrolled in NFJP. Now, in college and majoring in electrical engineering, she will work at an energy company making $15 an hour. James Alvarado, picking strawberries, barely supported his family on $15,000. Through NFJP, he became a heavy-equipment operator earning more than $28,000 a year on a farm near Harrisonburg.   The Bush administration has requested zero funding for the NFJP and continues to maintain, against its own evidence, that the program is ineffective and duplicative. Fact is, it is more effective than most. In DOL's Workforce System Results, NFJP had an employment rate of 83 percent, exceeding every other DOL job program. Neither is it duplicative. Statistics show that DOL rarely serves farmworkers in other programs.  If eliminated, funds will not be transferred to states, giving governors an unfunded mandate to serve thousands of additional workers with multiple barriers with fewer resources. Policymakers should be wary of the systematic dissolution of poverty programs and their attack on farmworkers. Cecily Rodriguez. richmond.    Well put, Cecily.  You and Bob Herbert should make wonderful babies one day.  You think the administration is wary of the (succinctly phrased) "systematic dissolution of poverty programs?"  How do you square this stuff with the compassionate part of compassionate conservatism?  By putting your hand on someone's shoulder and telling him you'll pray for him after you flush the program that provided his livelihood?   Stay tuned for episode #474
