Hence the title.    The second best Flash game of Euro 2004:   urlLink David Beckham's Penalty Shootout   Hilarious.  Against my better judgment, I'm starting an AIM account that I'll put on whenever I'm writing this thing - purely for the hell of it.  Drop an IM to Parallelcampaign then - I'm interested in seeing who you people are that are actually reading this hogwash.  And that's about enough for me tonight.
