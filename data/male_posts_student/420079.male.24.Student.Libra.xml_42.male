A 'hi' in the middle with two 'O's around it? Ohio! Spelled the same way front and back, as we used to say when we were kids."  (beat)  Matt: "Um, no it isn't..." Mom: (Blank stare) Matt: "Backward it's  oy-ho. "  (Much laughter ensues as my mother realizes she can't think coherently before her morning coffee.)  Matt: "I'm putting this on my Web page." Mom: "Get out of my room! Go away!" Matt: "No state is spelled the same way forward and backward." Mom: "I'm sure there's one!" Matt: "I don't think so." Mom: "Maybe we were thinking of 'Dad' or 'Wow.'"
