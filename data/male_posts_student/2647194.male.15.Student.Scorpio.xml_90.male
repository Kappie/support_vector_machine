With my second cup of herbal tea for tonight, and Guster on the radio, I'm getting a little drowsy...  Last night I wound up going to the weekly Magic: The Gathering draft tourney up at Unicorn Games in Oakdale. I did horribly, with 1 win, 3 losses (a total of 4 matches). Oh, and the only reason I won the last match was because the other guy's dad had come to pick him up early, so he dropped. He would have beaten me.  I won't be the first to mention this whole perfectionistic touch-typing thing, but I am one myself. Being drowsy is making some odd words appear on the screen right now (like ilke).  This whole past week I have been staying up late (until 1 or 2) playing starcraft online. Now its the time to adjust, meaning still go to bed relatively late and set the alarm. Not much fun. But I have to adjust for MITY, so I guess thats alright.  Not deviating from my average wakeup time for this week, I awoke at 5 min. to noon today. *polishes off tea and thinks* Practicing pool shots (with Dan) at the Y (oh-and Courtney was there too), and playing Halo and Red Faction 2 with Josh, Dan, and Tom basically made up my day.  If you're wondering who Courtney is, she works at the Y, teen center usually. I think it must have been before some band concert this spring at Central Park, before which I shot pool for several hours. Wearing a nice suit, mind you. I played solo for a little while, but then since there wasn't anyone else to play, I played her. So thats how I know her, eh, sort of.  On the way back to Dan's place from the Y, my right foot slipped of the pedal (clipless, so regular shoes suck), and got a little messed up. Now it hurts to walk, and bringing the tea up the stairs didn't feel good either.  While watching last night's NOW: With Bill Moyers show on PBS, one story struck me. The humanitarian crisis in western Sudan is starting to sound a little like the Rwanda genocide. The Sudanese government is driving all of the Darfurians (Muslims of Western Sudan) out of Sudan and into Chad. The government has sided with the Janjaweed Arab malitia in completing village burnings, including murders, rapes, and overall destruction that would make it impossible for these people to return to their homes. The entire story can be found  urlLink here .  Take a moment to ponder this:  Should we as a country and world power be spending more time (and money, of course) on helping to fix these kinds of problems, or should we go into countries (Iraq) solely to gain countrol of their oil supply?  I hope the answer is obvious for you.
