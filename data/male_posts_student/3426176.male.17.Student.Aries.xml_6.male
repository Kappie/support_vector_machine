Over the past months many good times have been shared with my friends Greg, Kim, and Gina (and Anna for the first semester) and many songs have been sung.  Here are some of the best moments of this lunch period:  I remember dubbing Gina with the name "Tubesock" after trying to explain to her how a tubesock was different than a normal sock.    I remember explaining to her that Holland is a country, not in Poland and their culture consists of wooden shoes, windmills, those funny windmill cookies and last names that have lots of vowels and start with "van" or "van der". (Ex: van Nistelrooy, van der Vaart, van Hooijdonk, van der Saar)    I remember singing the Zoobalie Zoo song with my mouth full of cookies and sounding like a retarded person.  I remember singing the Goldfishes song.  I remember singing Jimmy Crack Corn and I Don't Care at random.  I remember going with Gina to buy chips or pop or candy for no particular reason except just to go with her.  I remember Gina and Kim teaming up on me trying to kill me by tickling me to death and trying to get revenge by poking Gina's ticklish sides.  I remember discovering the fact that spoon backwards is "noops" and Zoop backwards is "pooz" and Zoobalie Zoo backwards is "ooz eilabooz".  Yes, lunch was great this year indeed.  I'm looking forward to next year already.  I took a picture of us at our last lunch today.  Maybe I will post that eventually.
