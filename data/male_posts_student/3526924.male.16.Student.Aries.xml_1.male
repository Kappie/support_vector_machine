A major investment bank is advising clients to have sex, get more sleep and stop equating happiness with money -- turning the industry image of hard-nosed dealmakers on its head.      German-owned Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein offers the advice in a note to clients by its strategist James Montier.       "I thought it was time that I reminded people there was more to life than watching screens every day," he told Reuters.       The note recommends clients have sex, ideally with someone they love, reflect on the good things in life, give their bodies enough sleep and exercise regularly.       But they shouldn't get too carried away.       "I still need a little bit of money just to keep me happy," said Montier.
