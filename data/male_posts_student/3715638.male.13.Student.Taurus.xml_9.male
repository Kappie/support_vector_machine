I was so bored, there was just me, my mom, my grandmother, and my sister is a 1 floor, 5 room house. And we just had one tv but the bad part was that my grandmother, who owns the place, got senoirs package for the cable. There was nothing to watch! Tomorrow, I start my first camp, a basketball one. I don't really know whos going to it but I know a couple people are. And, tomorrow, Mia is leaving for Domicia! I wanna go with her. Oh, and my cousin is taking a vacation in a vacation. Shes in England for two weeks and for 3 days she in Ireland! AH, I wanna go there! Shes so damn lucky!!!!!  On Tuesday night, at 7:30 at Gerards farm, my new soccer team will have a "meeting" to discuss a few things. I don't care about the other things, I only care about whos on it! I know a couple already, but, I wanna find out about the rest. Lol
