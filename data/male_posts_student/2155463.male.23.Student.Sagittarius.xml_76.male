I sent out my letters to law firms on Monday, and I got a call from a woman who does family and criminal law yesterday.  We actually were even able to get together and talk last night, but neither of us were sure about whether or how much she could use me.  But it was really nice to get a lead! :)  So then today I had interviews with two temp agencies.  Quite honestly, I don't know why I didn't look into them before!  My testing went REALLY well (I typed in the mid-70 wpm :), and they were virtually gushing over my resume and skills set and all (wait...ouch...trying to pat yourself on the back like that puts your arm in an awkward position ;).  So anyway...it looks like they might be able to find me a pretty well-paying job, but it could be pretty interesting since I signed up with two of them and I don't know what I'm going to do if one of them offers me a position.  But it's a nice problem to have... :)  But I have to say that some of the testing was kinda stupid, and then some of it was kinda hard.  I mean, I had to take a test on grammar (aced it :D), spelling (aced that one too :D), typing, alpha-keying, etc. etc. etc. (and it's been a long time since I've had to do long multiplication or division by hand!).  But then there were the tests on Word and Excel and whatnot where the test virtually told you what the answer was :P
