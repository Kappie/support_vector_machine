Reflector is a decompiler for .NET. It can decompile the .NET programs and components to IL or  even C# code. It is very useful since I can use it to view how a function is implemented in the .NET Framework. When I started the program, the Reflector let me chose the .NET Framework version, including 2.0 one. I clicked the 2.0 one, and the program worked fine. I tryed to open the mscorlib assembly and decompiled a method in the List  class. Wow, the decompilation process worked smoothly and I can see the C# 2.0 code! So I can conclude that the Reflector works woth .NET 2.0! How amazing it is!
