I have an incredibly high chance of never seeing some of my best friends again. Yet I will never leave them. We may stay friends and we may not, but I am as big a part of them as they are to me.  Whether they like it or not, each and every one of them has thrown a piece of themselves into the fire that is my heart. They're words will be forever etched into my thoughts and they're names forever engraved in my soul. So here's my final shout outs to my friends whom I can never forget. It may be coming a bit early, but the next month will be filled w/ fun and excitement. I don't want my emotions to get in the way of my good time. So all of you , in whatever you do, good luck and I'll see you L8R!  haress,johnny,roy, and the rest of my crew. - you guys have made my entire experience like a wild roller coaster, you know how much I love roller coasters! No matter how hard it gets, never forget that you guys made a differance , a huge differance, in my life here at sutter and in between.   ave,kaitlyn,and cathy- you guys know , or you should, that each of you are some of the coolest girls I know. Each of you, I say , if you  give as much friendship to all who you meet as you did to me, you can easily make this world a happier, funner, and sweeter place.  to my honors class mates- It was a pleasure to work with you guys and an honor to share you're company.I will miss you all dearly.  to all my teachers(6th - 8th)- You guys were always there to help w/ any problems or concerns I had. You never quit until I was happy. This quality  you posses is only surpassed by my parents. Thank you for being the wonderful people you were to me.  Take these words and hold on, not only to the content, but the feeling you had while reading them. Because in the end, that is all that matters.
