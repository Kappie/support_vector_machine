Johnny Gomez: Ladies and Gentlemen, Nick Diamond and myself are right in front of the set and we're live at Woodstock where a scheduled Celebrity Deathmatch is to take place anytime now between Nine Inch Nails' Reznor Reznor and limpbizkit's frontman Durst Durst.  Nick Diamond: No one's performing at the moment on the stage, but the fans are all pumped up for the fight.  It looks like Reznor and Durst are going to determine everything tonight.  And we can hear the music being played... It's "Hot Dog".  And Durst comes out from the side and the crowd goes wild.  Apparently, he looks exhausted from a performance he might have had earlier, but he's never too tired for a good fight!  Johnny: What's this we're hearing?  A techno tune, only increasing in sound... it's "Starfuckers, Inc."!  And that's Reznor Reznor.  The people are fanatical, roaring "Nine-Inch-Nails! Nine-Inch-Nails!"   Nick: We've come to know that this is his first public appearance in almost four years!  Johnny: Both of them onstage together for the very first time!  The lights are flashing and the music still audible, but where's Mills Lane?  Oh, there goes the referee right by us, and he's getting up onstage.   Mills Lane: Now you two, you obviously know the rules, so look around you and take notice of all the instruments lying around.  Ready or not, let's get it on!  : And it has begun.  Nick, this going to awesome, I haven't scene a Deathmatch venue of this kind before!  Nick: Yeah.  This sure is going to be one good fight, and because of their experience onstage they'll know exactly how to use the tools!  It's time to go stage side!  Reznor, wearing his trademark 'Evil Inside' t-shirt and khaki shorts, walks around the stage; it looks like he's thinking about something.  Maybe it's nostalgia thatâ€™s getting to him.  Or maybe he's just familiarizing himself with the set for more serious reasons.  On the other side, Durst seems to be signing autographs?!  But now he sees Reznor glaring at him so he goes towards Reznor with a mic.  Durst: Reznor 'Nine Inch Nails' Reznor, we finally meet to end this stupid feud of yours. And it's time to show everyone who's the best man at Interscope Records!  Reznor takes the mic away from Durst and kicks him in the midsection.  Reznor: You wanna fuck me like an animal, eh?  You like to burn me on the inside?  You like to think that I'm a perfect drug!?  Reznor tosses the mic aside, picks Durst up and throws him across the stage and into the drum kit.  Nick: There's some action!  Reznor's infamous habit of thrashing his own instruments onstage may very well prove useful tonight!  But look at Durst... he's up already but what's he taking out there...it's some sort of a slimy substance and it's star shaped?  Durst throws the object at Reznor and it automatically sticks onto Reznor's face.  With Reznor's face now covered with that slimy object, he can't see anything and he's screaming and running around in circles.  Johnny: Oh my God, it's a poisonous starfish!  What a move by Durst!  Nick: What's Reznor feeling right now, Johnny?  Johnny: Well, it appears that Reznor is currently in great pain due to the venom released right on his face by the starfish.  With great swelling and redden areas of skin, the one-man-band member requires serious medical attention right now if he's to even survive!  Reznor is found falling over instruments and scraping his face against the stage amplifiers.  Durst, on the other hand, starts taunting and posing before the crowd in triumph.  Nick: Look at Reznor...he's got the starfish off of his face!  Reznor can be seen holding the remains of the starfish.  But his face looks quite ugly, or rather it's just got the pink slime and/or colour of the obliterated starfish; Reznor's still trying to gain visual consciousness.  Most of the crowd are in awe, but some are chanting unknown verses of various limpbizkit songs while cheering for Durst.  Johnny: What is Reznor thinking?  He should just go and push Durst off the stage!  Reznor takes out a double barrelled gun.  By the time Durst gets back to Reznor, Reznor is found pointing the gun at Durst, and loading the gun with large nails.  Nick: What's that? It's a huge gun and look what he's putting in it!  Johnny: Apparently they are nine inch nails, quite literally, and he's holding a nail gun!  And the nails have some sort of sticky material all over them.  Nick: Oh, he must have used those nails to scrape off that starfish!  Johnny: As messy as the match has already been, with these two it seems like there can only be room for more!  Reznor, having loaded the double barreled machine of a gun, starts aiming all over Durst's body while Durst, with his legs crossed, tries to move in different directions only to find out that there's no way to escape Reznor onstage.  Johnny: Reznor can play on like this throughout the night; he's got Durst scared straight.  But where's Mills, Nick?  Nick: Good question, where is he?!  Johnny: There he is, right at the end of Durst's side of the stage... and he's lying unconscious!  Out of nowhere, Richard Patrick appears, jumps on stage, and kicks Reznor in the back.  Reznor falls but, luckily, is still holding the gun.  Patrick kicks the gun away from Reznor and takes it into his possession.  Now holding the gun, he points to the centre of the stage.  Patrick: You and your stupid sets!  It's not even worth taking a picture!  And Patrick starts shooting nails at the instruments.  The nails only ricochet and deflect back onto him.  He's fairly injured but not out, yet.  Nick: Johnny, this is quite the occurrence.  But who's going to benefit from all of this!  Johnny: I don't know, but look over there! It's limpbizkit's ex-guitarist, Wes Borland!  Borland jumps onto the stage from amongst the crowd, holding a guitar of his own make.  He slams the guitar on Durst's head, who had been staring at Borland in disbelief.  Borland then grabs Durst and drags him off the side of the stage.  Reznor, now up, runs over and past Patrick's body and jumps at Borland.  Reznor: Durst's mine!  Borland takes a shot at Reznor with the guitar, but misses.  And in return Reznor quickly picks up a keyboard that was fortunately laying next to him and breaks it over Borland's head.  Johnny: Oh, did you hear the crowd as Borland's head exploded?  Nick: Indeed, Johnny... that was nasty!  With Borland out of the scene, Reznor drags Durst to the centre where Patrick is apparently stuck to the floor.  Patrick: Ah, Reznor!  Help me out man!  Reznor throws Durst over Patrick's body, pins Durst down with his leg, and picks up the nail gun.  Nick: Reznor just won't answer Richard Patrick's screams for help!  Filter's singer is in serious pain!  Reznor points the nail gun at the two helpless opponents and shoots, only to find that the gun lacks ammo.  Reznor: Damn it, Richard! You wasted all the nails...  Johnny: Nick look, Mills is up and he's going straight at Reznor!  Mills: Now what's going on here? You wanna finish off Durst with that gun?  Johnny: And the crowd goes silent...  Mills: I'll allow it!  From behind referee Mills, a box of nails comes sliding over to Reznor.  Reznor starts staring at Mills, trying to look around him to determine where the nails came from.  And out of nowhere appears Marilyn Manson.  The crowd grows even louder.  Johnny: What else could a crowd ask for?  They've seen it all!  Nick: Look at Reznor smile and nod at Manson.  Reznor reloads the gun and holds it up.  Durst: Reznor you...!  Before Durst can even complete his sentence, Reznor fires shots at Durst, and even finishes off Patrick.  Reznor hands the gun over to Mills.  Mills: Hmm... nice gun.  And the winner is... Trent Reznor!  With "Starfuckers, Inc." playing again, Reznor and Manson leave the stage and walk off into the crowd.  Johnny: What a night this has been.  With interferences from three other artists and Mills unknowingly falling unconscious, this has truly been a whole different Deathmatch altogether!  Reznor was deservedly victorious at the end.  Nick: Yes, Johnny.  It looks like Reznor can start concentrating on making music again.  And who knows, maybe Reznor and Manson are headed to Reznor's recording studio right now!  Johnny: Who knows?  But we do know that this concludes a rather incredible edition of Celebrity Deathmatch. Live from Woodstock, I'm Johnny Gomez.  Nick: And I'm Nick Diamond.  Johnny: Good fight...good night! xBuBzx
