The message is,  'One of these days, i'm going to cut you into little pieces!'  From then on, everytime Pink Floyd plays  One Of These Days  they have a floating pig with it in concert. Other great songs are  A Pillow Of Winds ,  Fearless ,  San Tropez ,   Seamus .  Fearless  includes  'You'll Never Walk Alone' , Pink Floyd's finest moment.  San Tropez  is about a private island, and  Seamus  is about David Gilmour's hound. But no-one can forget their final  greatest song from the album,  Echoes . This 20 minute horror-comic opening cut includes weird sonds and awesome guitar solos.  Echoes  went on to be named Pink Floyd's best of album in 2001. -Richard Dasher
