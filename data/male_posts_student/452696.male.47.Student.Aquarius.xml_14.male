It's way too remeniscent of shift work, which got me into a wierd sleep pattern to begin with. Holy Circadian Rhythm disruption Batman.  I registered for my courses for this coming year. Somewhat disappointing since I have completed one semester already, but cannot move ahead until the year does. The courses seem to be set up to cater to someone coming in starting at zero. For example, I had wanted to take the second art history class necessary for foundation year. I can't because it's not scheduled until the Winter session. Doesn't seem to be any advantage to work ahead.  Last couple of weeks has been extremely hot here. All in the 30's. Whew...sweaty. During this time I met with a fellow I had known in my years with the Calgary Police Service and he had an exit interview of sorts with me. He's currently back on contract with them in the H.R. area doing this. We compared notes on similar experiences and found many. He also told me that these same experiences are consistent with all of the other interviews he had conducted with retiring members, and those who had quit. Common themes? I guess this would be an opportunity to fix those issues if the CPS chose to. But it's unlikely they will. Why? They have to keep the feudal system alive and preserve the status quo. If they start making positive changes, then there will be lots of traditional police positions that would need to be filled by properly qualified civilians. Can't have that, where would they put officers that have screwed up or are going through negative psychological problems. I mean, thats what we have human resources and training for isn't it? Or the front counter of district offices.   I figure that in ten years from now if I can speak of the CPS without getting angry then I will have finally moved on. I hope I can make that happen.
