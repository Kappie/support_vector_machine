We will always be close. If anything happens between us again, it happens on its own. (Although I hope it does!!!) But I have to say it just might not. I will be jealous of anyone she dates from now on. I hate this, but oh well. Everything will work out for the best. We might both find people better for us, or we might come to the realization that we belong together. Or I might come to the realization that because I hurt every girl that comes in my way so what I really need to do is just be single for the rest of my life. Jerks like me deserve to be alone for the rest of eternity. Ask, and I might tell you why I was so terrible to her and why now I have so much to regret and so much to never forgive myself for. I miss her so much. I might not actually be over her. But still, I have ben such a jerk to her. The Backstreet Boys have annoyed me before, but I actually understand them now. My favorite line of theirs is from "Back to Your Heart" from Millenium. It says, "If I wasn't such a fool, right now I'd be holding you." Not only did we rush it too fast between us, but I was such a jerk that I think I hurt her, though she says I didn't. There was all kinds of stuff since early August I could have done to make it work, including not rushing it. I could have asked her out in September or October and we might have been fine. Well, no regrets, right? Yeah right... I regret being alive right now... Please pray for me! Blog ya tomorrow!  In Christ, Mike > In Christ, Mike >
