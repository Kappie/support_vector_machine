A biomechanical suit designed solely for the purpose of spreading death, distruction and meteing out justice to space pirates everywhere.  Samus, I want to have your love child.  Needless to say Metroid: Zero Mission and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles are fan-spank-ass-tacular.  More people need to buy GBA's.
