I believe the U.S. should try to do something about it. Don't they have the technology to trace back the militants even if they free them? C'mon, let not this guy be the new  Nick Berg . P.S. There is also this problem in Saudi Arabia: the police force works also with the terrorists, that won't help!   urlLink FOXNews.com: Saudi Kidnappers Threaten to Kill Hostage
