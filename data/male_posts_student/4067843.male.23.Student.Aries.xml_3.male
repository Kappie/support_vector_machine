I got the opportunity for the last two days to be the CPC Monitoring Director for the NAME project...(North American Monsoon Experiment). It was quite nerve-raking but ultimately a good opportunity in which I learned a great deal. My job was to the prepare the 6-10 day forecast for the NAME region (pretty much Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico) and all fellow meteorologists would understand the annoyance of trying to forecast a phenomenem which isn't easy to forecast in the Day 2 period, but to try to get any semblence of skill in the 6 to 10 day period. I then had to address the Forecast Operations Office in Tucson, AZ in a daily conference call. Rumor has it I did a good job so we can chalk that one up as a win.  I have really taken the past week off from all of my projects, its easier to deal with the post-presentation burnout by just taking a step back from all the research. I will be traveling back to Huntsville on Friday evening (hopefully).....and my summer of perpetual motion will finally come to an end and I'll be able to truly settle down. There is something about moving 4 times in 2 months that drains the life out of you.....  And of course with only two weeks remaining until school starts, I have an enomorous amount of work to do in those 2 weeks.....say unpacking everything I own, getting set up in my office at school, pre-thesis talk with the advisor, buying a car (which is quite exciting) and all that entails, and just mentally getting ready to relearn fun things like dynamics and thermodynamics......  Don't become too comfortable with the lack of political banter, it will surely be back.....  The blog and the website may be on the move as I look into getting things hosted on my own server in the coming weeks....
