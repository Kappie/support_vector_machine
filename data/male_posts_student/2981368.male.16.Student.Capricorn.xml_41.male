If I make it through work without half-dying then I'll have another night of 'polite socialising' with adults then *trying* to sleep in most of Sunday.  Oh, and ITS STUDY LEAVE  Thats right, a whole week and a half of study leave for one 20-min exam. Which is right at the start of study leave. Wow, this should be fun. All that revising. Yes. Woohoo. Ahem. Revising.
