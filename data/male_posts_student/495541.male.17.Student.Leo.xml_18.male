I was just messing around with the filters and various options.  I really don't know much about Photoshop.  I really wish I was better with it.  Problem is that making images is not easy with limited skill and no ideas for what to create.  I really admire those making very abstract art with the computer... it's amazing.  I see many tutorials on how to make one thing or two.  The odd thing is that these images contain so much detail.  I'm not sure if I could ever learn, but I really want to.  What else is going on?  Well I joined a Counter-Strike clan.  It's called  urlLink Counter-Assassins .  My two good friends created the clan, so I think that's the only reason I got in.  I highly doubt I'll be in many matches.  They've got two teams with 10 or so, I think, on each.  They just had a match tonight and won.  No one even told me about it.  Oh well.  It's just cool to have the tag in front of your player name :-D  Anything else?  Yeah, I've been doing some updating my site quite a bit.  I'm thinking of a new design.  Not sure what it will be.  While back, I was messing with CSS.  The program I was using was pretty nice.  One problem with it is that it had all tags, correct and incorrect according to the WC3.  One of the major things I want to be sure of is that my new design is WC3 compadable.  I want it to look perfect in all browsers.  I don't want it to be your average only-working-in-Internet-Explorer type page.  Those are quite annoying.  Until later.
