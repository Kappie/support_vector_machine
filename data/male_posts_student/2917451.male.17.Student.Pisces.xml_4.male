(gd thing got hair)   but then something went wrong. number tags!! where e F*** was number tag? i didnt even realise that every finalist needs a number tag. adrenaline almost had the best of me, but i managed to calm myself down a bit. rushing here and there, asking everyone, trying to figure out how e hell i was supposed to get my number tag. man, it worn me down a bit. or should i say, it was the perfect warm up exercise.   managed to find nirav after a while. got my number tag already, which is good. but f***!!! aiyoyo!!! i need safety pins!!! luckily some da sao got extra, shared `em with me n marcus. den athletes` march n all, with pledge(which was crap)...and then it was the moment of truth.   our race was last in line, so we waited for the other 3 races to be over. someone fell down( which has been a classic hilarious moment), den ismail told us to come over tot he starting line. it was perfect. just like how i imagined and visualised it to be. thinking about it, i was visualising this moment so much that everything felt just like deja-vu, and it was making me sick of boredom. i cant wait for it to be over, the burning ache is killing me.  the voice of the emcee, the wild crowd, the introduction of every runner, ismail with the gun, the subtle wind tickling by. the hot burning rubber track, the tight double-tied spikes, the sweat flowing slowly down, the other runners on the other tracks.man, it felt like forever. i hugged marcus good luck...and the continued with our focus.  and i imagined all these happening 2 days early.  "ke garisan...sedia...BANG!!!!!!!!!!!" it was the best start i`ve ever been. i kept pushing and pushing, and it felt all along so smooth. i never did bother to check right or left. it was my own race. swing swing swing swing, i kept swaying right and left for that maximum speed. then i began to get furious, i was hot i was on fire, i was burning so much to win!!!   never mind if bijendra is already so far ahead, its all under plan, i told myself. keep cool, keep pushing ahead baby!!! swing swing swing swing, i can feel my jaws tightened and my legs numb, it was as if it was the marathon race...i was exhausted.  then, zoom! i reached the finishing line!!!curious, i looked right to see marcus already running right beside me!!! "aaarrrhhhh!!!! brother!!!! waaahoooo!!!" i could not believe it, it was the perfect finish, i was second, followed by marcus 3rd.   to hell with the rest of the world! i was screaming at him!!! and he was screaming at me!!! "suuuuuu!!!!" aaarrrhhhh!! we might not have realised, but after that ppl were calling me crazy and all, jumping like nobody`s business on the track!!! but hey! look who got the trophies, dude!!! we got it!!!! we fatsos got it!!!( ok, i`m e only fat 1...)   man, tiring but, a moment hard to forget. never had i such exhiliration n ecstacy...
