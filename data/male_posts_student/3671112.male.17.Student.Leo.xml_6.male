IrenicPenguin of the  urlLink aMule  team told me he likes the  urlLink Fujifilm Finepix A330 , and it's only $200, AND available for pick-up at  urlLink Best Buy  stores (which is preferable for me), so i can just take a 10 minute trip to best buy once i get the money. however, any other  urlLink suggestions are welcome .  i think  urlLink Nat Friedman  was kidnapped or something  [edited: apparently amule.org needs the www subdomain - fixed]
