No chance. How ‘bout a document review You have to put the job first, job last It had to be a big firm, run fast…  Well the tobacco money’s gonna pay your rent And the asbestos money’s buying your meals And all the money they’re getting From the mafia is buying you wheels  No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big firm, didn't you You want to squeeze the life from me You had to be a big firm, didn't you But what else goes with this degree? You treat me like a king all summer So much fun to practice law And then you pull the rug out leaving My friends and family grieving -- big firm, whoa…  You had to be a big firm, didn’t you?
