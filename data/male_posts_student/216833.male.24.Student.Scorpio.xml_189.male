I think I have been away from home more then ever before. Away from a computer even more. haha. The bird rescue job is starting to pick up. Today we admitted 6 birds during the moring shift and I had to do a few exams, one died on me but the other(a quail) is doing better so I am stoked. I have an interview with a book store tomorrow in between my two jobs, so maybe this will be better than zales for the momment. I like books alot better than jewelry. Diamonds are a touchy thing, people die over that shit and I feel like I am only making things worse for them. This weekend I watched ringu with jeremyu and wasn't that impressed. Mimi went out to point reyes and saw three whales. I didn't get to go, I was shunned from the vehicle. haha. I think that is where we are going to be camping at the first of May. One year anniversary coming up very soon. Wow. Time flies when you are having fun.  I'm soooooooooooooooo tired. Speaking of palmer, he may be coming out to calif soon to party with his brother's bacholer party crew so I might get to see that fool. I could use a little home latly.  - - peace, more than ever - -   current mood:  tired current music: And You Will Know Us By theTra - aged dolls
