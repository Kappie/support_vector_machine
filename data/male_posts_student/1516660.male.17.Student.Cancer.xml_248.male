It's covered in sores. The doctor said too much heat and poison. Yeah. Heh. I have been eating heaty stuff too much I guess.   Oh my! I was worried about my Bursary Award! It hasn't arrived yet you know. I called CK, and the mother told me that he had received and the deadline was yesterday. I was so mortified! I called the school, which was useless. I then searched the Internet, found the department (Finance) of MOE and called. The lady confirmed that I am receiving a Bursary Award. She was surprised that I did not receive a letter. She said she would print one out and send it to me. I can register late, due to postal error. That's what she told me. I am so worried!! My $250!!!  In the afternoon, I printed out my blog entries till yesterday's. YaY! Major accomplishment. Major enough to send my black ink into low levels. Heh heh.   Now I got a radio, I became more aware of the latest music happenings. Yeah. I found myself singing songs from the radio. The latest songs I like are:  Kelis - Milkshake ,  Jamelia - Superstar ,   Blue - Guilty  and  Dido - White Flag . That's all I cam remember. Hey! I did an experiment. I logged on to the online webcast of Perfect 10. I found out that it lagged behind the actual broadcast for about 2-3 minutes. O.o!! How surprising.  HaHa! I think I end liao la. I got almost nothing to say..... so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
