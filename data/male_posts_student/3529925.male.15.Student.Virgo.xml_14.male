And look like [insert name of prefered attractive male here because I am far to masculine to admit that I know the names of any]. Soo.. I played CS practically all day. I feel like a shithead. While that game  is  said to require one to be smart in order for them not to suck, I believe that it slowly sucks the intellegence from you like aparasiticalbrain monkey. Which is, consiquencially, rather unfortunate. Hehe.. it is far to late for me to spell consiquencially right, or to check my spelling. Screw the readers. Oh wait, I dont think there are any.  Damn ..   So, I've been pretty bored lately. I dont really have anything to do anymore. Thats where  you  come in. Yes, YOU, my friend. Please send a donation to me for the hell of it. Consult me through AIM or email, both of which are in my profile. Thank you! Have a nice day! Seriously. If you dont contribute, Ill hunt you down and kill you like a goat, who is really annoying. I need a new computer.
