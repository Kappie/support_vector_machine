All the kids I've ever known whilst living here tend to develope the same and fall into, though unique, hateful cliches. I honestly think that should some of the same people I know, never have lived in Winter Park they would be different (more likeable?).  I've always lived outside of the tight winter park society. Gah, I'm so angry and depressed that I'm not even in the mood to complain about it (I almost wish some certain others where in the same mood---).
