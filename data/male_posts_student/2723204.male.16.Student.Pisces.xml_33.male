This time it is talking about God and limits. Are there limits to God? Can God create a stone in which he cannot lift? That's the most common question many agnostics esp. would ask. Over here I intend to talk about this. Does God possess limits? In my opinion, No, (i don't intend to substantiate this assumption just as yet, but I'll come up with a hypothesis anyway.......), but I believe he is in control of a varaible limit. When people compare God to something limitless, boundless, they usually think that God is like so Good, so smart, so powerful, that really, he is limitless. But i beg to differ, i mean, how good is good, how smart is smart etc. etc. (check my essay on the design/evil argument).   Even if God is really really powerful etc. there has to be a limit to his power, even if we cannot see it. Its like in CG, we were asked ,"Why do we say God is good and God is not the best?" It is really that Best is a limit of Good, when we say best, it cannot get any better. No matter how fantastic and how far out this limit is, a limit is still a limit. So in here, I shall give a hypothesis on ontology and the nature of God in the context of limits. The greatest gift God has given to mankind is the mind, every single thing you see here, stemmed from a thought, the computer, your handphone etc. The mind is ever-expanding. The fact that Einstein used only less than 5% of his brain matter can testify to that. Even if our intelligence expands, we would still be using the same 5% because our usage expands but so do our capacity.  I'll write about this epistemological hypothesis of mine another time..............i'll talk about how to fly......lol............The human mind expands, from the discovery of fire to Fibre-optics, this shows the flexibility and stretchability of the human mind. And I believe that God has a mind which functions the same way as us, the human mind is prehaps the greatest masterpiece (no matter how great your girlfriend may look).  God is not static, he is always on the move, maybe, when we were at the wheel stage God was at the time travel stage................God has no fixed limit. Because if he did, our human intelligence would be able to reach it, God is constantly moving his limit up and up, to keep up with the progress of human intelligence, human intelligence could acomplish anything, but we could never possibly keep up with the pace of God's limit............What God can do is never fixed, he would always adjust his limit to the development of human intelligence. And God's limit may not always go up and up, if human intelligence is reset, God would have to bring his limit down to the original level.  Which brings me to the issue of cloning........i mean, you've heard about critics saying about the "playing God" thing, and the religious bigot, George. W. Bush has even banned cloning. What i believe is that cloning is playing God but playing God many milleniums ago, when he created the first human, through creation, through evolution, through the big bang or through whatever. Which is why I wondered to myself, why did God created this whole Earth and had to rest at the seventh? I then realized that God had not pushed his limit up yet...........(in creationism that is....)  That's basically it.............I cannot write anymore, my sis is chasing me away from the comp, she wants to use..........lol
