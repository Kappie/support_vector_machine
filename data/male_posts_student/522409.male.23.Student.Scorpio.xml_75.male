It was a really exciting thing, though.  It got a little scary when I got to class and people started looking over the score... something about classmates reading intensely personal lyrics unnerves me.  But it was okay.  They were impressed, and I am pleased, especially upon going back over the song a few hours after turning it in.  It really is the lyric part that's so hard.  Maybe that's why I feel more comfortable with the idea of jazz composition... the idea that I can spend all my time writing for a couple of horns or a big band or something.  Maybe there are words, maybe there aren't... only I know.  The vulnerable feeling isn't there, though.  Says the boy who posts his inner conflicts to an online journal. *sigh*
