My ANMATH2 (Mathematical Analysis) professor, Dr. Tristian Reyes told us that "Math is like sex"  If math is like sex because of reasons such as...  --> "It's either entertaining or boring...", Pearl Ng --> "It's a pain in the ass", Joanna Sioson --> "There's a lot of methods (to get to the end)", Pearl Ng --> "It's a union of two sets", Jason Lee --> "Once you start, you can,t stop", Joanna Sioson --> " Nakakapagod " --> " Kailangan mag-practice para tumama ", Marjorie Bundang --> "When nothing seems to work, you just have to suck up" --> "No matter how hard it gets, you have to stick with it", Paxi Alcantara --> " Nakakatigas ng ulo... ", Mike Ogbinar --> "You can get stuck with it for hours",  --> "It sucks..."   urlLink Nameless Wanderer  --> "It's all about numbers. Yea, numbers, like 69..."  urlLink Nameless Wanderer    [Leave me a comment or two if you can think of other reasons...]  Mike explained that if Math is like sex, and programming is like math...  Therefore, Programming is like sex.  Great first post eh? I just dissed my Assembly programming project...And yes, all we had to do is do basic mathematical operations on signed and unsigned numbers... and my project sucks ass. I didn't get to do half of the signed numbers part but I guess the unsigned numbers work pretty well...   Despite of this, I don't want it to program with assembly for quite some time after I finish that subject for this term... Yes, Assembly nice and all that but it just painstakingly sucks and debugging is like looking for a one peso coin in a bag of arcade tokens...  Does that mean I don't like sex? We'll discuss that some other time...
