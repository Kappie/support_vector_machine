However, I did get some work done before meeting up with Melissa and Becky at Spring Fling. It was fun for the most part... the only really annoying thing was the long gap between the opening band and Brand New. The concert was fun though. I'm not really a big fan of Brand New, but the lively crowd made it fun. It was somewhat amusing seeing Melissa and Becky's reactions in the chaos of the first few songs. I've noticed something about pits for these type of festival shows... or maybe it's an east coast thing, but the lack of circling. It's more of a chaotic billiard ball break, than the circular movement of pits I'm used to in LA. I look forward to the Bouncing Souls show Wednesday...  After the show, I went home and cleaned up, before heading over to Melanie's place for a little get together. It was nice. It's a shame we Traffic people didn't do more stuff together before. Although the Bud Light was making me sick... it's been a while since I've had cheapo beer like that, and I had 5 cans... ugh...  I got home around 3:30 AM and chatted with Crystal a bit before going to sleep.  It was a fun and tiring day. It's a nice close to the year.   ***
