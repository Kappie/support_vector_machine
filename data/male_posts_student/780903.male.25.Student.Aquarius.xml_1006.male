Anyway, I keep on fumbling the lyric and wanting to sing "God's Only Nose" instead of "God Only Knows."  So I figured I could ingrain the flub into my head even better by writing a whole parody lyric for it.  Apologies that I've sunk to lowest common denominator potty humor here.  Hence:  God's Only Nose   It may not smell like flowers If you eat beans and wait two hours Some things smell very badly Cause God lost her nose, so sadly God's only nose, she can't smell without it  The smell of bread in the oven A smell no one can help but lovin' But right when the Earth was forming God lost her nose one morning God's only nose, she can't smell without it  That's why some things smell charming And others more underarm-ing After the nose was finished Her sense of smell diminished God's only nose, she can't smell without it  God's only nose, she can't smell without it
