I work most days, including weekends, from 5 am - 1 pm. I have a couple of days off, so I might be doing some work with my dad to finish moving some things from storage, among other things. I still won't be able to talk to most of you for a while, but I will try as hard as I can to keep in touch wit'cha. P.S.- Me and Alyce made section leaders of the Trombones! Yay for us!
