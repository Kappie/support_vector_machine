My first reaction was, "cool, a really detailed account," but then I saw the length of the thing (it is really, really long - roughly equivalent to a page or two of text for each of the "deceits")and thought "why bother?"   Honestly, I'm spent on the subject. Burned out, tired and really sick of the subject.   It's going to be a long summer.   UPDATE:  Steven DenBest has  urlLink similar feelings .
