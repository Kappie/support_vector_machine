That's all my classmates are doing, that's all close to all of my Pre-U Sem mates are doing, that's all probably more than 80% of the JC students in Singapore are doing. Not that I blame them. In fact, good on them!  Part of me doesn't care and part of me knows I have to join the muggers sooner or later. In fact... I'm might just be joining a few of me Pre-U Sem groopies to study tomorrow. Only... I find it pointless. Like I don't have a motivation to study.  I guess what's settling in is a sense of purposelessness. Something that I'll have to face. But thanks to God, I don't have to worry about purpose. So help me God.  Then... There's this nagging feeling inside. I don't know what it is. I guess, cause me Pre-U Sem mates kinda gave me a sort of security, they can also take it away - deliberately or not. You see, I've been trying to get a sort of group study thing happening, but apparently it ain't. It's really not their fault. Priorities are priorities. They need to study. Not in a group cause it's not the best I guess...  But that's not the problem. Is it? I don't know what is. I'm going mad. Ignore me.  Germy
