However, since Wed I have also been extremely blah.  There are several reasons for this.  Part of it is that I needed an emotional break from the stupidity of my family and church.  Part of it is a lonely feeling since it feels like most of the people that I thought loved me turned thier back on me the past 2 weeks.  And a large part of it is worry about money ... since I have none.  Someone offered me $100 for him to give me a b/j .. I ALMOST considered it.  But that is just too yuckky!!  I have been talking to a couple guys online.  One of them had agreed to go to a movie with me but we never actually set a time.  I even gave him my cell and said to call if we didnt run into each other on chat ... did he call ... no of coruse not :(    Whatever, his loss.  So I thought the Richard drama saga had probably come to an end ... but who should message me last night but him.  He said "I know this is weird, but I miss you".  In truth I had wanted to message him and say that to him all week.  But I didnt!!  He broke up with me ... if he misses me and wants me back he has a LONG hard road ahead of him.  He asked me if I had missed him, and I was honest but left it there and didn't give him anything extra.  I am still anoyed with him.  So the blah days continue for now.  I just don't care about much of anything right now.  I am not upset, not happy, just kinda here.  oh well.
