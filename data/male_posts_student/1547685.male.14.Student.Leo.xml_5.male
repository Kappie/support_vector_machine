First in science we saw a video on the 30 hour famine and it was really sad. It talked about how every day 29,000 people die from hunger each day in 3rd world countries. I made me want to make a commitment to do it but i cant since i have an important stuff going on for youth grouo and im a council member. Besides that my first two periods were test reviews and my 3rd peroid honors class was really funny b/c our teacher told us about her "adventures" on the sr. ski trip she went on. The stories she told were great and remember that a trip really isnt a good trip unless you got memories to share with other ppl. In spanish class we did........... well nothing really. For English i was reading the red badge of courage until i closed my eyes and accidently drooled on my self (woops) while falling asleep. The rest of my day was great after that b/c bible and P.E. are my favorite classes. Tomorrow is going to be hard b/c i have 2 tests to take and then i have to work on my baseball card project about jerry rice. TTFN
