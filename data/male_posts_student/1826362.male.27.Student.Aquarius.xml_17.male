Want to get a cup of coffee? Wait in line. Need to sign up for health insurance on the last day of open enrollment? Wait in a really really long line.  On the bright side, I'm now the girlfriend of a sex god.  I mean, I now have health insurance.  Yay!  I can get hurt or sick now! At least for the next six months.
