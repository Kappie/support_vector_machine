I just turned around and found out that it was on my favorite channel in the whole world. Authentic Hip-Hop is what they labeled this show. HA! Enraged, I stuck my tongue out at Petey Pablo and turned the channel from FUSE to G4TECHTV. I feel great now, and i should be able to write without any distractions.  //A call by my girlfriend woke me up today at one o'clock this afternoon. hehe. I sat in bed another hour before i actually did anything. I love summer. I think i ate like a snickers snack sized candy bar. Bored out of my mind i went to the library and looked for somethin to read. There are conviniences to having a library a block down the road from your house. I searched for about ten minutes until i found this really neat book called  urlLink The Five People You Meet in Heaven.  Its great. Quick reading book. I'm on page 56.   //I rode over to a friend's house tonight and stayed till about 10 tryin to fix his computer. On the way home, a deer jumped out in front of me while I was going slightly fast down the road that had a straightaway for about a half of a mile. Not a problem though. He ran away before I even pressed the brakes. I got home a little later, took a shower, watched tv, and looked around on the internet a little bit. I talked to this really cool girl outa georgia. Her name is Beth Ann, and she gave me an idea of a Blog. I've been wanting to this for a while, and i hope ill keep it updated.  //But that is about it for me today. Nothing special, so i had to describe every detail. hehe. Gotta get some sleep for tommorow. I actually have plans. Im out. peace.
