I have some of my pieces in a notebook (sitting in my new Dead Tubey messenger bag) however the rest are on the laptop (probably in a warehouse somewhere)  Thomas, let me start out by saying welcome back. Also that people don't respond well to contests. Believe me. I know.  I'll be updating in a completely random order until I'm done, dammit.  Jonah: I tried desperately in vain to find the Fiesta Bowl parade, but I was in Pasadena at the time, and thats kind of like asking for Pepsi in Atlanta. Nathan: Crazy Idea! Don't try out for the play. You'll thank me on many a spring Saturday morning. Marten: IKEA! Erin: IKEA! Thomas: IKEA! Sophia: IKEA! (That rhymed. Hee.)  And...I'm spent.
