Anyway I juz realized today that...Its almost the end of July already! I have been here in Tucson for more than 1 mth already! Wow...I do wonder how my friends back in Spore are doin...      Anyway, its really a boring day and I realli dunno what else to do except playing GB. Yep I juz got promoted again, thxs to the hard work of playing everytime. I guess when school starts, I will not hav much time playing GB already. Hahaxz anyway I passed my driving today already so I'm free to go...But still muz practice more on parking the car, though I did relatively well...Lolxz better not 'kua' myself too much or else get a bloated head. Anyway its kinda boring typing all these stuff too, and I'm oso getting impatient waiting for my mails from my friends. Argh god knows when will they be arriving...I'm gonna go sleep now after drinking some wine. *Yawnz* (-_-) good night....
