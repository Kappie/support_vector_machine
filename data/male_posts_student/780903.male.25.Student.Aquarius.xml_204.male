Like simply seeing them at a job fair a year ago is going to make me more likely to take a summer position at Mayer, Brown, Rowe  Maw.  I remember their name only because they gave out a pen.  Anyway, I got there pretty late, but I was still able to collect a bunch of free toys.   One firm was giving out Bon Jovi CDs.  I'm confused as to why.  Perhaps the remnants of a promotion from, oh, I don't know, 15 years ago, were discovered in a warehouse?    I missed the stress balls -- they were all gone by the time I got there.  Does it say something when a law firm gives out stress balls?  Are they admitting their job causes stress?  Or just that they got a good deal from the local stress-ball supplier.
