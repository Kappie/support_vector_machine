Now, we may have one more week of classes... and then, a week of exams, but this weekend just felt like summer to me. It was nice. I'm very much ready for summer to be here now.  The weekend started off great, as I went for my second time at my friend Steph's church youth group. Steph's lead's the band, and I must say, she does have a great voice... about ten times better than the one she uses in Chemistry class singing songs you'd hear on your parents radio station. Anyways, after that, we decided we were gonna head out to Steph's house. The drive home was very entertaining, as Allison drove, and me, Steph, Vince and Steph's cousin Jess road with her. Allison decided she would stop for gas, and that of course was the perfect oppurtunity for Steph to honk the horn with "the club". This freaked Allison out, as she was filling up at the time.  We then drove Jess home to pick up some stuff before heading to Steph's. We were waiting in her driveway when these punk-ish looking 11 year olds road right in front of her van on their bikes, across Jess' lawn. This was also the perfect oppurtunity for Allison to honk the horn, and you could see one of the kids look back and the Van and mouth "What the fu-...".  So, back at Steph's, we watched Pirates of the Carribean. Meh, alright I guess... way too long though.  I got home around 1:00 a.m, so that wraps up my Friday. Yeah, I was tired.  Saturday was a whole other day of adventure. Me, Vince and Steph decided to head to the mall together to get a gift for Megan, as it was her birthday. We definitley had a blast, especially in the toys etc. store. We bought "Arthur in a Bag" for God know's what reason. We also stopped in at Toys R Us, where Steph procided to play with a hula hoop.  Then, the actual party came around 6:00 p.m or so. We walked over to Meg's. Present at the party was...  Meg (Well, clearly) Rachel Sarah Resident Goon, Shawn McCormick Junior Vice-President Goon, Randy McNally Steph Lindsay Vince Aleasha aaaaand C.E.O of Goon Operations, Me.  McCormick started the party off well, when I went to go chase a football that had been thrown over the fence... little did I know, they had already got the ball, so when I went over to get it, McCormick through it straight down and hit me in the groin. It hurt.  A lot.  But it was funny.  Very funny.  Fun was had later on... especially playing this game where if you can't think of an answer, you get  SPRAYED IN THE FACE WITH WATER.  My personal favourite would be when the question was "Things You Find In A Girl's Purse", and it came to me, I said "My phone number." Thank you, thank you... thank you.  I also accidently smashed Nichole over the head with the thing that gives out the questions. I laughed... checked to see if she was ok... then pointed and laughed some more.  Later, when it was dark, we headed over to Paramount Park just to hang out and such... buuut we got bored, so we went back to Megan's backyard to... well, hang out and such. But it wasn't as boring because there were TORCHES... and chairs. Chairs are good.  The party ended with an unfortunate "ice brawl" with the leftover ice from the cooler. I think McCormick and Randy each got hit in the face a good two or three times. Then Randy accidently through one right into Lindsay's lap. Classic.  Then it came time to go... but a good time was had.  Well, it's only Saturday night now, so the weekend isn't over... but my goodness, does it feel like summer. I couldn't be happier about it either. Hm, it's only Saturday night, so hence, there may be stuff that could happen tomorrow...  This may include: My brother, a birthday, a wrestling mask, a resturant, a ppv, and golf. They'll all add up somehow.  I swear, they will.  Dave
