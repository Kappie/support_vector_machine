I swear, I've had 5 damned girlfriends since she decided she didn't wanna be with me anymore, all 5 were very attractive, all 5 were totally into ME of all people. And two of them I could of screwed. Not that thats my goal in life, but still. None of them, except Lauren, made me even remotely happy. That and the fact that I've been stupid enough to risk destroying the almost perfect relationship with my Best Friend on account that I thought it would be a good idea to ask her out. Shit, I wish things weren't so freakin complicated. I still feel love for Amy, I feel bad about what happened with Lauren, she did make me really happy, and for a while there I actually started to get my hopes up that she was the one, something I should'a learned after my heart got shattered into peices small enough to thread through a needle by Amy. I'm over Markita totally and have been for a long time, but I find myself caring about her, as if she were my little sister. Which is even more weird cause I don't even worry about my biological sisters that way. I've slowed my cussing though, that's the only good thing. Geeze, I should be shot.
