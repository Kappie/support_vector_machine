I may begin publishing my Commu-Capitalist manifesto using Blogger... it all depends on how well I like using a third-party site to publish my works onto the www... we shall see.    Today I went to a picnic and met with the people responsible for funding my upcoming trip to Germany! Being around those people just reaffirmed my love of Germans! We have finals next week, and that weekend we're leaving for Deutschland, I am *so* excited!! I just hope the guy I'll be living with isn't a dyke.    Well, it's late and I have my hard classes tommarow, so until next blog!(hopefully a little interesting!)                                                                                        -Aryan
