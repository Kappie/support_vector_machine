Well, my mom wanted to get there early, to get oriented with what shes going to be doing (she's helping too this year) and i guess i needed to get the games set up as well (i was a games leader).  Well, when we got there, i found the man i was going to be working with, and we went over the games we were going to play with the children today.  Then came the opening ceremony.   Well, after the torture of listening to the really bad sounding 70s like songs that were organized for this event, we started up.  The first group that we were going to do games for was the "middlers" or grades 3-5 i guess.  What we did was play "wacky baseball", a game where there is only one base.  All the kids have to do is hit the ball and run to the base without getting out, and then run back home.  Well, i was pitcher.  All in all, the kids had fun playing that.  We actually ran out of time while playing that, then we had to switch groups.   The next group we had were the "pre-teens".  They also played the same game, but since they were mostly boys (7 boys to 1 girl), it went pretty well.  I think the most times i had to pitch to the same kid was 3 times, while when pitching to the middlers, it could have gone up to 11 times.  After we finished with them, it was snack time.  Today, snack was ice cream, but i didn't have any.  Have to watch my diet *wink*.   After that, we had the littler kids, and we played T-ball, catch, and find the trophie.  I hid the trophie every time, i got to be pretty good at it ^_^.  We also did the same thing for the smallest kids.  I think all of them had fun ^_^.  Then i got to back my moms car out of the parking space!!  W00t!  Tomorrow -> out of the parking lot.  I was born behind a steering wheel!!  I'll keep you posted!  Lates
