I woke up Sunday morning, took a shower, and left.  Nobody knew where I was going, except my mother.  I got to Jami's house around 9 AM; it was our four month anniversary.  Now, I know what you're thinking: "Four months, so what?"  Trust me, these past four months have been the BEST four months that I've been alive.  You know what the cool thing is?  It just keeps getting better.      Jami didn't know I was coming, she was still asleep.  Val the Gal, complete with wet hair and bathrobe, let me inside.  I crawled in bed with Jami and kissed her on the cheek.  I put my arm around her, as I've done so many times before, and she knew I was there.  She knew me.  I love that more than anything.  :)    We hung out, we went to breakfast together.  I spent the entire day with her, which is what I can't wait to do for the rest of my life.  She's amazing.  Holding her in my arms, I can't begin to understand how I can feel the way that I do about her.  It's just pure love.  I'm in love with her.  I always will be.      I got home last night, feeling tired.  I took a shower and layed in my room, under the cool air from my ceiling fan.  I began thinking of Jami, I'm always thinking about her.  She consumes me.  I wish I never had to leave her side.  Someday, hopefully, I won't have to.      Mom and Dad came and put their two cents in while I was laying in bed.  It's too late for them to intervene.  I've already grown too far in love for my parents to try to pull me out.  I'd do and have done pretty much everything it takes to break their simple rules.  They don't understand me, they can't fathom the thought of me loving someone so much.  It almost makes me wonder if they love each other.  They anger me, they expect too much.      Anyway, I'll stop whining now.  No... no, I won't.    I woke up a little before 5 AM this morning.  I got and shower and rode to Huntington with Dad to pick up a Ryder truck to deliver seedlings with.  He got the truck, and I drove home by myself in the fog.     I was supposed to work today.  I can't.  I went for a half an hour and still didn't have anything to do.  I don't fit in there, I don't have a place like I used to.  It might be my own fault, but it doesn't matter to me now.  I have other ways to make money.  I'll be alright.    So, I'm at my grandmother's house right now, and she is the only person that knows where I am.  Well, Brice might know, but he's asleep on the couch here beside me.      Brogan has to get a root canal today, poor thing.  I hope she's alright.      Also in the news, the prestigious Mason County Fair starts today.  This is the first year I can remember that I don't have a fair pass.      Oh well, I better go eat some lunch.
