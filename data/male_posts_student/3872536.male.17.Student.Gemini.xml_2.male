Then see quite a few tjcians at e library mugging (so scary). Then eat at hawker and when we return to the library, kana chased out so went BK study. Spending bucks. Haiz...  Then went new house to swim (or rather try to swim lol)  Wkends --- Family day. If i'm not mistaken, we went to buy mattress. And the next day move stuff to my new house lor. Damn tired. coz moving tables etc... Training...  Mon (21/6) --- Went self study wif choon pei then happen to meet wee teck at the library. Initially he's supposed to meet his friend/s but ended up his friends ps him so he joined us. Then eat at mac.  Tues (22/6) --- Went self-study wif kai cheng at tamp library. He's like complaining how far tamp is lor. Somemore i late hehe... Then happen to meet choon pei and her friends thr. Study till like 12++ then go bk eat. Then kai cheng appetite too good, went for 2nd round at KFC then settled thr to study. He was like wanting to eat the kachang putei (sorri duno how to spell) but ended up not eating coz too full liao. Hmm... It looks like tat day's a eating trip rather then self-study. But quite fun :p  Wed (23/6) --- It's my turn to go ang mo kio for self-study wif kai cheng coz he lives in huogang mah. Then somehow can't get to the library even though he gave mi the directions. Haiz, tat's mi lor. Then the view surrounding the library was like so damn nice till i dun feel like studying and ended up sleeping. I onli completed a set of econs notes tat day. Then again, kai cheng was like complaining how hungry he was at about 12++, whrby i reach thr like bout 11 lor. Then ended up eating at the nearby hawker. He bought a $3.80 stuff and still not filling, while i onli spent like $2.90. Then went mos burger studying and bought drinks. Money wasted again. After like 1h thr we decided to go back library...(money wasted 4 the drink man) On our way thr kc was complaining hungry AGAIN but ended up onli bought one bottle of sour plam ding and fried bananas. Then go library slack... After tat on our way home, kindof influenced by him uh... It's mi tat's searching 4 food liao. We ended up buying rojak (coz i like it). Hmm.. Another day wasted ba, but still satisfying coz i reach amk alone... Haha..  Thurs (24/6) --- Went self-study. Initially i dun wan de but haf to pass something to choon pei so i went. Meet pei yu and kain beng and go self-study at Bk. I ended up buying chicken nuggets and cake even though i had had my lunch lor. Then learnt some magic tricks from pei yu and do some self-reflections of kian beng thr.  Another day gone man but it's ok coz i learnt magic tricks haha...  It's onli like a wk and i spent like $30++ juz on lunch+snacks lor. Haiz... Spent so much still haven finish studying.... k lah... Yowns...
