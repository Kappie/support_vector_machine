God it's great...especially while listening to The Ataris, memories music (In This Diary). Well I shouldn't be all sad about the past...I have the best years of my life yet to come. YES! THATS RIGHT!!! 10th grade should be alot better, then 11th is even more better, then 12th! THE BEST!!! But I don't want it to come, being an adult must suck. I don't wanna grow up! I WANNA STAY HOME WITH MOMMY AND BE A WITTLE BOY!!! I wuv my mommy.
