Watched old 10 pixels-per-inch episodes of Saturday Night Live at Evans' place - eyes hurting now (Stupid decision 2). Cue to dinnertime at the nearest McDeez... close-up of greasy freckle-faced kid taking order - Hi, and welcome to McDonalds, how may I swindle you? Ryan - I'll have a Big Mac and a McChicken... bag it up please (Stupid decision 3). I better go to sleep before I do more dumb stuff... although I doubt that it can get lamer than takeaway from McDonalds. 1 billion burgers sold? More like one billion souls buggered...
