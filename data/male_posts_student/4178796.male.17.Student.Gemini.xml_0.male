I think it might be because I'm affraid of letting Henline down.. because I mean I'm a thespian and... it would be right for me to exel in all the things I do in drama related things... so I'm going to tough it.. and try to live out this week... so then theres U.S. history... there is a test on friday.. on memorization of the states.. where they go on the map.. and their capitals.. plus I have to memorize the continents.. and some other things. I'm not entirerly sure if that will be hard.. because I had to do it in grade school, so if I can do it there.. I can most likely do it now.. but its just with all the other drama thats going on.. and all the other stuff I'm having stress on... its making it hard... I don't know what to do..  ok, lets see what else is on my list for stress this week... oh yeah! stupid me! I forgot all about the classes I have to take for the "problem" of stealing signs... and I think its sooo stupid that everyone else got off... that they got to go home without even having their parents called... it pisses me off so much.. and then every expects me to just let up and forgive them!? whatever... don't think I'm going to do that after you sold me out... and lied... ugh!! it makes me mad.. I just want to forget THEM.. the only person I'm NOT mad at is Alicia... I mean some part of me is telling me that I should be angry at her too... but then again, she was in the back seat the whole time.. and she wasnt questioned by the officers.... but Jason and Julie are different... they were being so untruthfull that night.. I mean tney saw me being put in handcuffs and pushed in the backseat of the police car.. and still didnt do anything!? that the fuck is that? thanks alot for leaving me to die.. leaving me for the vultures how can they not see why I'm mad? ugh.... now I'm thinking differently on Julie... me and her.. are really good friends.... we have alot of the same dreams.. and wants.... I want to be her friend but now every time I look at her.. I see... someone who pretty much stabbed me in the back.. (real friends stab you in the front right?)  I dont know if she lied.. about her not seeing who took what.. but she did lie about seeing Naugle and "Waving" to him.. making it impossible for her to see who took what... and I know that Naugle wasnt driving by at that time.. and I know she saw who took what! shes just lieing.... she along as everyone else should take those classes with me.. because they were involved in the theft.. I shouldnt be the only one that has to sacrafice their time... I don't even know if I'm going to have time to do midsummer night... and that makes me mad.. because Alicia and Julie will be able to do it.. but no.. not me, I have to take classes about what I did wrong.. I don't think Julie and I will ever be as close as we were... its sad, discovering who your REAL friends are... I'm just finding out in all the wrong ways.. it hurts..  so anyway on a better note... I went over to Alicia's yesterday, it was so much fun.. and I can't wait for next summer!! its going to be so awesome! we have to do this Alicia.... like I said Imagine two people in a new york city hotel dancing to 80's music... doing "the dance" :P I cant wait.. and we can do the same in London! while were drinking!!! muahahhaha.. then maybe we can do it in italy.. omg, that would be so much fun... *cries* I can't wait... it will be fun, we can't back out! :P well I'm going to go.. search for my monolouge.... bye....
