Well I'm going to dedicate this post to try and explain those questions to you.   Why am I a Conservative?Because I believe that you should have to work for what you own, not just have it handed to you on a silver platter. I don't believe in government handouts, unless the situation is extreme. If you start off successful, and all of a sudden something tragic and ireversable happens, and you lose absolutly everything, then a little pick me up maybe in order. But if you are perfectly capable of getting a steady paying and safe job, and you just flat out don't WANT to, then I don't think my tax dollars should go to you, at all. You maybe wondering what taxes that I, a 16 year old in Wyoming, would pay. Well, folks, everytime I buy something I'm paying taxes, its called a sales tax, and I don't believe that even 5 cents for every dollar should go to some scumbag who is capable of, but not willing to get a job. I'm not against welfare, I am against abuse of the system. Sometimes things just happen, we can't stop them and we can't change them. But sometimes people are just lazy and need a good kick in the ass to get off the couch and get a job.  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe in the Right to Life. Our fore-fathers wrote it in the Constitution, that every man, woman, and child has the  inalienable rights  to   Life,   Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Did you catch that?   Inalienable right to life.   Leftists believe that a woman should have the right to choose if she wants to keep her baby alive or not. The right to choose huh? So, what the Left is saying, that if I don't want somebody around, in this case a fetus, I can just terminate them, right? Well Abortion is murder, so, if you look at it like that, if I don't want someone around, say someone who beat me up in the past, I can just "terminate" them right? If you said this to any Leftist in America they'd say "NO! Thats murdering somebody who is alive!" Well, so is abortion. Life starts at conception whether you want to admit it or not, and if you don't, well, you're wrong. I differ from some conservatives in how I think we should deal with abortion, however, I don't believe that we should ban abortion. What I DO think we should do is classify it as Murder, which is exactly what it is, then we wont have to worry about it, do we?  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe that Marriage is, and should stay, between a man and a woman. If we allow Gay Marriage in America, what's stopping people from wanting to legalize beastiality? Or Incest? If we allow Gay Marriage in America, we will spiral into moral decay, and our civilization will end. Don't mean to sound too pessimistic, but its the truth, and you know it.   Why am I a Conservative? Because I am DAMN proud to be an American. This is the best country in the world, no matter how you look at it. We have more freedom then any other nation in the world. And with that Freedom comes responsibility, something the Left wants to get rid of all together, but thats another topic. Patriotism and American Pride are a very large part of why I align myself with the Right. Just because you don't have pride for a certain administration, or a certain president, or a certain law maker, doesn't mean you can't have pride for the freedoms and liberties you have to vote that Administration, president, or lawmaker out of office. If John Kerry wins the election come November, I will still be damn proud of being American, and I will still have respect for the Presidential Office, maybe not the man who holds that office, but the office itself I will have immense respect for.  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe strongly in the second amendment, our right to bear arms. The Left wants to strip the average law abiding American citizen of their guns, thinking that it will reduce crime. Wrong! The people commiting the crimes will STILL get guns, and STILL rob, rape, and kill unarmed, law abiding Americans. If you take away our guns, you put them in the hands of criminals, theres no two ways about it. This part of this post isn't going to need to be too long because it pretty much explains itself: You take away our guns, you take away our Liberty. End of Story.  SO there you have it, folks! I'm a Red blooded, Pro-Life, anti-gay marriage, gun-loving and DAMN PROUD American. THAT is why I, Whitey McCracka, am a Conservative.
