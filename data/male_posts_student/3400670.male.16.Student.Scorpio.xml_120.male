IT'S BEEN SO LONG........I'm finally back from 130 hours of imprisonment in the Oregon Convention Center for the International Science and Engineering Fair.  Yeah the most common phrase over the last week for me was "Where are you from", gosh I've had to said it over 500 times............And from that I've met sooooooooooooo many people......from all 50 states and 38 countries around the world!!!!!!!!!!!! And the most valuable experience of this whole week was making such valuable friends.........And have the opportunity to meet future leaders, future billionaires, future Nobel Laureates, not to say that we had the chance to actually talk to the current Nobel Laureates.  And overall, there was TONS AND TONS OF FUN!!!!!! ENDLESS FUN....PARTYING EVERY NIGHT FROM SUNDAY NIGHT TO THURSDAY NIGHT...........More social activities the past week than I ever experienced in my life.  And tomorrow I'll have lots of fun tomorrow catching up with all the work I may have missed. And catch up on the current status of the impending party for our great APUSH teacher Ms.Clark.   And finally, I missed all of you the past week, hopefully you all had a fun week!  See ya all tomorrow!!!!!!
