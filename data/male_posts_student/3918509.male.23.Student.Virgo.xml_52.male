As a friend of mine said the other day, the amount of venom in political circles is astonishing, and tends to make me want to give up.  Someone I know wrote out a list of all the terrible decisions that President Bush had made, and concluded, "F*** you Bush!!!!!!!" in bold red letters, three times larger than the rest of the text.  Not all of the left is crazy, and not all of the left wants to f*** Bush, but enough of it seems to have taken leave of it's senses that I tend to tune them out.  The problem is not limited to the left: there's more than a few on the far right who despise Bush almost as violently as the Michael Moore left.  They list every economic mistake that the Bush Administration has made (the tariffs are popular for this), combine it with a shrill denunciation of the invasion of Iraq, and conclude that Bush is a liar in every sense of the word, who can't be trusted to tell the truth even about the weather.  Ad hominem and non-sequiter attacks abound, from both the left and the right.  A libertarian article yesterday accused Bush of vacillating, finger-in-the-wind politics ("worse than Clinton"), and offered as proof the handling of the Iraq war.  I blinked: here I thought Bush had gone to war in the face of determined UN opposition and without overwhelming American support.  Apparently he forgot to lick his finger that day, or something.  I'm a long way from a true-blue, cheering Bush supporter.  He did disappoint me with a lot of his domestic policies.  I'm not sure what to think about Iraq: I would like to believe that America's leaders made the best decision they could, based on what they knew at the time, and I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt: necessarily incomplete information  will  sometimes lead to bad decisions.  It is also possible that the president and his people exaggerated their case in an effort to get support.  But I'm not allowed to be in the middle of the road (as a very wise man said, you tend to get squished there).  The nutty leftists and the shrill right-wingers are both driving me to support President Bush.  I want to carefully critique his statements versus his actions, do the same with Kerry, and decide which one is more trustworthy and more likely to make good decisions, and then vote accordingly.  The struggle for me is to maintain my sanity in the meantime, and not get caught up in the chaff which is obscuring the radar.  I'm tired of this election, and it's only July!
