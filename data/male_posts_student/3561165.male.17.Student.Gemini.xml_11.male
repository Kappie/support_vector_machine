Greetings, and various other nice things that I may have to say to you, my name is John Aziz, although you are probably aware of this already. As some of the more musically mindful amongst you may have noticed from my blog title I am fixatedly obsessed with all things Smiths related, and generally most rock music related stuff, with little exemption. I am a miserably despondent A-Level student, in hasty preparation for an examination tomorrow morning, which I think I can conclude that my lack of revision has been tantamount to failure. I'm studying (perhaps the past tense would be more appropriate, but assiduous I am not) the convoluted work of M. Shelley, 'Frankenstein', Arthur Miller's 'Salesman' and William Blake's 'songs'. All of these are divinely artistic and masterfully crafted (with the possible exception of Blake, our favourite colloquialist). I suppose my conquistadorias expectations of the metaphorical equivolent of El Dorado (i.e. easy questions) on the exam paper will be shattered with something intimidatingly oblique as "Victor Frankenstein is homosexual. Discuss" which will leave me agog and cause me to spontaneously combust and fail the examination paper. Ah well, as long as I can score A grade's in three of my five subjects (Rank ordered in terms of my likeliness to procure an A: History, Politics, English Literature, Law, Mathematics) I should be able to get entry to a half-worthwhile fountain of learning (layman's terms: University). Anyhoodles, I had better get back to staring gormlessly at my newly modified satrical pisstake Bush poster, now adorned with a napster-cat logo covering Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-Pies face. If any of you don't find this to be ironically funny, it is supposed to imply that Napster (once the symbol of freedom, liberty, unity and internet utopia) is simply another head of the capitalist Hydra, venomously sucking the life and expoliting ordinary humans. If you cannot work out why Bush is emblematic of the capitalistic system of expolitation and advantageousness then you should fuck off and read the Daily Mail. Have a pleasurable day and wish me luck in my exam.
