I forgot I had English homework, so now im wreaking my brain trying to remember exactly what the hell I was supposed to write for that Yearbook assignment in Akin about Myrtle from the Great Gatsby. I havent even begun to work on my History paper. Im missing the second half of the Fetal Pig Dissection on Wensday because I have to go to this "Student of the Month" Assembly during first period. Im preety sure homework isnt my strong point.... Do you ever go to a resteraunt and at the end of the meal it comes time to pay the check and the tip and everyone has put in more then enough for the meal and barely enough for the tip? We went to Fridays after the Colorguard show on friday night and at the end Roland, Chandler, Kevin Dion and I split our part of the bill because the table got divided funky. I only got a Brownie Obsession and a drink (which come out, roughly to about 7$ before tax and tip). I know everyone put in their fair share and i start handleing the money but I just couldnt figure out how the hell to get the tip right with the money we had there, so I end up paying like 16$, all the meanwhile Chandler's giving me this dirty look like "Why the fuck are you still going over the money, youve been doing this for like ten minutes." Whatever, in the end the chick got a good ten-twelve dollar tip so im fufilled. I made one of the stupidest decisions of my entire life this morning after my mom compared my gorrila legs to Robin Williams, so you'll all get a good laugh tommorrow.  Thats enough randomness, maybe ill be able to sleep now that its midnight.
