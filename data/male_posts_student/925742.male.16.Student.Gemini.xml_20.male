I caught the bus and went home. Too bad my mom thought I was still at school. She searched for me for two hours at the school and called home (which I was conveniently on the outside of at the time). But after those two hours she went home and found me on the doorstep with numb feet and hands, blue lips, and teeth chattering away. I am partly to blame, for I didn't bring a spare key; but after all, who searches a school for someone NOT there for two whole hours?? Come on!
