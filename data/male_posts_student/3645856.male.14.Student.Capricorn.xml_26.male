I am in the library right now in Charleston, South Carolina... and it is closing soon and we have to be back in Savannah, Georgia tonight...and this is going to be rather long. Ok... commence the starting of the typances. (I wrote this last night)  Sitting on the 12th floor oceanfront balcony of room 1246 in the Dayton House Resort's suites highrise building, there aren't many places I would rather be than looking over the skyline. To the left, the Atlantic ocean, to the right, the hustle and bustle of the city. Yes, a single story beach house with a private beach on Hatteras Island is nice, but I enjoy change every once in a while... not to mention our beach house being sold after Hurricane Isabel's damage last year. But, you can see everything from up here!!! If I want, I could go up to the 13th floor roof and hang my feet over the top. This is the last night here in Myrtle Beach on our venture south down the lower East Coast and i'm sad to say we're probably not going to make it to Tallahassee or Jacksonville or to the Florida border at all as there is so much to do along the way down. But, we are probably making coming within 30 miles and it's been a lovely cruise so far. Like the license plate says, smiling faces, beautiful places (my chicken scratch writing makes it look almost like it says feces... but the wind is blowing pretty hard up here). South Carolina, Georgia, (and if we made it to Florida, i'm sure it would as well except for the mass quantities of senior citizens) beats Virginia by a wide margin. To tell you the truth (why would I lie about it), the old dominion seems more rednecked than S.C. and the people down here are a lot nices and can't compare to the average Virginian you come across.   Holy crap... there's three or four people parasailing within a few feet of each other and one of those banner planes almost hit them. I didn't mention the night life down here. There's of course, places like Ripley's which looks somewhat out of place as it's built to resemble a closed down factory. Laws are different from Hatteras Island, as I have come to find. Aah, here are the ladies with their produce truck again. They come by the highrises every day and cruise down the street selling their own tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, melons, and cantaloupes. I'm pretty much writhing this right now because I want to get out of the way of housekeeping.   Ok, I just took a couple hours of intermission (of writing this yesterday) and my parents have gone shopping and I'm out on the balcony listening to the radio and writing this again. This vacation has been fun overall so far, but a little creepy and shockeing at the same time.First of all, I was going to go parasailing in Savannah (today) but we bought fireworks (two days ago) and decided to shoot them off the beach instrad. We (my dad and I) went along the beach shooting firecrackers and a cop showed up following us in a truck. He yelled at me and said "You wanna stop running so I don't have to chase you" and he got out and said to my dad "Fireworks are illegal, did you know that?" and my dad said "No sir" and the cop accused us of hiding something and he had his mace out then he screamed at us "Would you like to go to jail or pay the $300 fine?" (we found out later it was really $200). The whole time he had his handcuffs out and he was pointing his mace at us and he had his gun holster unbuttoned and we were explaining (as he asked us to) then when he got a call on his radio he told us to "Shut the fuck up" and then he said something into the receiver for the radio and he got into the truch and as he drove off, said "Consider this your second chance." The whole time I was thinking "Holy shit... it's robocop"... over fireworks... lmfao.  After that, we went back to our hotel. The funny thing was that the people up in the highrises behind us were cheering and yelling "more fireworks" when we were shooting them and when the cop came they were booing and the cop got all pissed off. We went to Georgetown and stopped at Hampton Plantation and it gave us really bad vibes, especially around the slave's quarters. I mean, it was just really creepy and we wanted to get out of there. After that, we walked by Charleston harbor and took a walk around the historic Charlestown area and around the battery and the park. Afterwards, we went to a bigger plantation (Boone Hall Plantation) where a woman was crying and she walked up to me and hugged me and said that her husband inherited some money and said that he punches her and that he was about to drive off without her and she said she was scared.  You know, that is the worst feeling you can ever get. She told me that she had been married for 39 years. It just scares me knowing that it goes on and I can't do anything about it. It's the worst feeling you could ever get. Because she is so helpless herself. I walked around the plantation and the whole time she was leaning over a fence crying and nobody could help her. I can't really be sexist or discriminate being male myself. But some people just never learn. I mean, what could I have done. I've seen it all before when I used to to volunteer work at the laurel shelter. But... to have someone come up to you and say that really impacts you so much and even if you've thought that you've seen it all... Her lip was bleeding too. I still feel like i've done something wrong by not doing much... but I hope I helped make a difference by hugging her and talking to her.    - Ok... that's the end of that writing. We're spending the night here in Savannah at a bed and breakfast and I photographed a few plantations this morning here in Charleston. A few of the plantations (as I said) gave off feelings like you weren't supposed to be there.... and it really felt like that at a few of the cemetaries and graveyards we visited. We're driving to Atlanta the day after tomorrow and we're going on a few more historical tours. I'm going to visit the famous Maple Street Music and Guitar Shop in Atlanta. We're going to visit my dad's friend, Doug, in Conyers, Georgia, outside of Atlanta, and we're driving around the area a bit.   On the way back to Myrtle Beach from Georgetown yesterday, we saw an old black man get hit by the car in front of us. After he was hit, the car slanned on their breaks and we swerved off of the road and almost hit a palm tree and they caused about a 5 car pile up. We swerved just in time... :P... That was another sad time as well. Anywho, it's 7:00 ish and that's been my vacation so far, i'm going to go find my parents (they went shopping) and we're going to eat dinner and head to Savannah. Good bye and I may stop in for another update. By the way, that stomach flu and bronchitus is gone... I still have a little congestion, but i'm doing well.  Oh, I almost forgot a dream that I had... I had two dreams but I don't remember the other one. Ok, dream time...  I was somewhere... in a city or something. Anywho, (I haven't said this but Shelly is in Boston right now on vacation) I had a weird dream that she got shot...  Goodbye...  ~ George
