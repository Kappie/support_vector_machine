On the way to campbell river I drove on the old highway and on the way back I drove on the new highway which is much better. That took two hours to complete, and then I got home and had some good ol' instant oatmeal :p. I talked to BJ for a couple minutes and then I left for tennis. Not much happened at tennis, we mainly just did a bunch of drills today. Wes has gone camping for two weeks so he wasn't at tennis today, so my instructor was kind of sad because Wes is the "Mobile Pharmacy", lol he always brings ibuprofen, tylenol..... and many other things. My partner Nick also wasn't at tennis, so it ended up being pretty boring, although I can always entertain myself by joking around with Erika (mostly inults lol).  When I got home I was really hungry because I hadn't really eaten anything today so I "cooked" some Chef Boyardee and some noodles. BJ started to whine about going to the pool, I really didn't terribly want to go, but meh... it wasn't that bad. We met up with Ashley and Steph at the pool and apparently today was "not being annoying day" or something like that... it kind of worked I guess, they only yelled once but that was because there was some kid that kept looking at them under water while wearing his "super pervert goggles", lol. Umm... went down water slides, swam in pool, swam in other pool, sat in sauna, bought some stuff at vending machines.... went home.  BJ burned me a copy of World of Warcraft, which will apparently take me about three hours to install.... so I'll do that tomorrow. And then I had some craisins, marshmellows, and cracker type things.... watched some anime.... updated blog.... and now sleep. O YEAH!!! AND COOKIE STOLE MY TEMPLATE!!!... well..... GRRRR TO YOU COOKIE!!!......... lol :p, just kidding... your still loved......... I guess.......
