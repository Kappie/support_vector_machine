Section 8 also gets help from fellow Fire fan groups like the Barnburners, the Arsonists, and the Ultras, but usually there are a little - no - alot more than 9,000 of us at Fire games.  C'mon people, we symbolise what the future of Major League Soccer is about.  Thousands of fans packing a stadium supporting the best sport in the world by cheering, singing, banging drums, and cursing out the other team and officials.  All of this energy we generate goes to the team we are supporting leading them to reward us with goals, saves, and wins.  However the attendance numbers this year have been a joke.  Four games played, all of them with less than 13,000 fans.  I'll be straightforward here.  That is shit.  I mean no wonder why the Fire lost two of their first three games at home.  No support at all.  That 3-1 home loss to Columbus was the most disgraceful loss I have seen them play and it was also the smallest, tamest, crowd I have ever seen at home.  Other teams fear us, but if we keep getting such lowly attendance numbers the home field advantage will wear away.  This Saturday Freddy Adu will arrive into town so the numbers at the game should soar, but I would hate to think that so many people are attending this game to watch someone from the other team rather than our team.  So I say to you go out and watch the Fire game at Soldier Field.  Go out and watch Freddy.  But remember why you are actually going out in the first place: to watch the Fire win, to cheer them on, and to watch the beautiful game.  Another thing that I am pissed about.  Chivas USA.  For those of you who don't know, Chivas USA is close to becoming the next expansion team to enter MLS.  That's cool, but the problem is the owner of Chivas USA is none other than Jose Vergara, owner of Chivas CD.  Chivas CD is a Mexican soccer club that has an outstanding history behind them.  Every player to play on Chivas all time has been of Mexican descent.  This is all good, but Mr. Vergara wants MLS to lift their restriction of three foreign players per team just for him so he can field an all-Mexican team -  IN AN AMERICAN LEAGUE .  That's not going to work buddy.  I don't even know why Vergara wants a club in the United States as it is.  When it comes to soccer, America is Mexico's worst enemy (whether they admit it or not) so why is he trying to help MLS with his investments?  I think if his club is successful, he will make it look like MLS is a joke of a league, if Chivas is not successful, he will turn around and say the League treated him unfairly or some crap like that.    CHIVAS SHOULD NOT BE IN MLS!!   And as if that is not enough, Vergara wants his team placed in a city that 1) already has an MLS team in it and 2) already has (or has plans for) a much envied "soccer specific stadium".  He wants to go to Los Angeles so he can leech off of the Galaxy's newly constructed Home Depot Center or - get this - he wants Chivas USA to call  CHICAGO  home.   OF ALL BLOODY PLACES!!!   Do you believe this?!?!  This guy has the balls to come into a hostile country, put a team in their league, want rules to be broken to satisfy his desires, and request that his team share a world class field that he did not invest a goddamn penny in.  Buddy, if you want to stick your foot in the door of my team's stadium and request to share it with us, I will rip the boot off of your foot  AND SHOVE IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR ASS!!!   You are going to take the hispanic fans attending Fire games and build your club with their image so they will go to your team.  Hell no buddy.  And Peter Wilt (general manager of the Fire) what the hell is your problem?  You are encouraging the enemy into our town and taking our fans to move into our stadium that we are paying for?  I hope you are just talking out of your ass b/c if you are really serious about welcoming Chivas you are seriously an idiot.  And if you aren't talking out of your ass, be a man and tell Vergara to go do something unpleasant to himself.  Don't make your fans do it for you.  MLS, if you want a city worth expanding for, promote the Rochester Raging Rhinos from the A-League to MLS.  They have everything you want.  1) soccer specific stadium [that is expandable mind you] 2) a good team, [this team beat the Fire in an Open Cup match two years ago, they are for real] 3) a dedicated town, owners, and fans.  In fact Rochester may have the second best soccer fans in the country. (Only behind the Fire fans when they feel like showing up)  This is so obvious.  Take Rochester, screw Chivas.  Do the right thing for American soccer.  Tomorrow I will talk about my MLS All-Star team and I will give my first album review.  I bought  Cradle of Filth 's  Damnation and a Day  and I will give a review of that tomorrow.  Until then, see ya.
