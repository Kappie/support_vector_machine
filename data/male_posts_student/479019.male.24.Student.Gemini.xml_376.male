It's childish and is an example of what goes on, on a global scale. The world doesn't work in black and white. Truth is subjective in that facts need to be interpreted, and the facts themselves are tainted by presentation. People do make valid points about having the war, but most make ignorant statements that don't take into account so many other variables floating around out there.  **
