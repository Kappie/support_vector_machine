I'm getting the walking part, but I need to stop eating crap. But the move takes a lot of time and I can't say no to a pie even if I feel disgustingly sick afterwards. Enough excuses though.  My arm actually hurts today where I got my tetanus shot (Just the every-10-years deal; I didn't step on a nail thank God!). I think it's more of a combo of the shot and lifting heavy boxes and flailing my arms about trying to keep the damn bugs away from me along the Blvd. while walking. Tomorrow I get an eye exam and some new glasses so that should be fun. Downside: Have to go to Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. I loathe Wal-Mart with a passion, notably the one here. You get so many people from the "hollers" there that I like to entertain myself with "Mullet Hunting". Unless I find some cute glasses frames there or Mom makes me get some there, I'm definitely looking at some frames at Lenscrafters. Maybe some Armani ones if they've got some small-ish dark non-wire rim frames. I'll know more tomorrow, naturally. I'll post a pic of me in them when I can, if not then definitely the frames or something similar to it. I hate not having a digital camera.  Since I'm moving soon and my email will change, I've changed my email address on the profile to my Yahoo account. I'll be sending out emails to the people who's emails I have, and the rest of y'all can get it from the profile. I'm debating getting another one with the DSL account from SBC for the family, since I don't really want Grandma sending forwards to the family and having mine show up as what it is. Not that I have a problem with it, but it's my family, and that's a little odd.  One last thought before I go to bed. My other grandmother, on Dad's side, called tonight and wanted to know if Josh and I want to go to Utah near the end of July to visit my half brother and sister Tristan and Madison. I haven't seen them in years and they're soooooo cute now, so I feel obligated to go. Part of me wants to go, but part of me doesn't. I don't know if I could take drive out there with Fred smoking the whole way, and then having to be out there for 10 days or something and not talk to my friends, or Blog (maybe an audioBlog or two), or go to the mall, or be the flamboyant homosexual I am. All my clothes would smell like smoke, and so then my room would have the smell for a week, and then school would be starting. I'll probably end up going anyways because it's the brotherly thing to do and I don't want to be a bitch, but there are those negatives. I'll mull it over, but now I need to rip some CDs into iTunes and get some sleep.
