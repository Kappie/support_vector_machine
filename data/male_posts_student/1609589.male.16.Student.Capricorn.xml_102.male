Probably because blogger is an asshole and provided no easy way to fix the links, so i had to go in there and search through HTML. That's why more people do MeloDramatic- one, it's made for rebellious angst-filled teenagers, and 2. it requires no HTML. That's why i use blogger, to feel superior. :-D
