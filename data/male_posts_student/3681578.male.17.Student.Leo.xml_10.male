I started of my day leaving my house at 6 and eventually making the decision to ride the jeepney over the fx mainly because there were no fx-s at that time...upon reaching ateneo, my clock struck 7:15...yikes! I only had a small time to go/half-run to faura hall (F-320 to be exact) and there I only found Jim-Jim and a closed workshop, meaning I was not late at all...  I even had enough time to run off to Berchmans and arrange my locker and going there...I met Ms. Fritz, our ECE 21 teacher...I half-run/walked back to Faura and found the rest of class still arranging their stuff...  We continued doing our exercise, a metal case with 3 rows of drilled holes and a small box hole for a switch...I already finished mine after 3 hours of hardwork but I still have some minor finishings to do, I have to continue my A-streak there...  There, Ms. Lopez also released the results of the last 3 exercises we did on soldering, decoding resistors/capacitors and layouting of components...I got full marks for the first two while I got one mistake on the latter...All the same, an A class standing...  That was just the only class I am quite pleased...  Enter Schmitt Hall (C-109)...Math 21 class with Doc Mara, I found what he discusses quite easy (as always) mainly because I am quite able to follow him and predict the next steps of the solution...However, I am quite uncomfortable with the fact that our next long test will be on next thursday, though I still have a lot of days to prepare...  I just find his exams difficult but hopefully I'll score better in this one since the topic is easier for me, derivatives...So there, I think I'll just have a go on some of the problem sets at the book and maybe answer some sample examinations...  The day ended with me in Fil 11 class with Joseph Salazar...The class now proceeded to "Panitikang Moderno" so we have a new set of elements and concepts to extract in the next articles or so that we will read...plus I got a 9 out of 10 in the recent essay quiz which I was thinking of flunking...  So there...  I have a paper in Lit to start and an outline in Eng to finish...  So...    --Logged Out--
