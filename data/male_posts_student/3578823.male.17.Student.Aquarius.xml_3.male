We are going to be here all night long, until 12am tomorrow. I don't think this is so bright seeing as I have to take the ACT tomorrow. And I have to shop and pack like a mo all day tomorrow because Upward Bound is Sunday. OH YEAH. In other news...INFINIGEEKS.COM IS BACK UP. That's right folks, after a whole 2 months, Infinigeeks is back. It took us forEVER...but we are glad it's back(when I say 'we', I'm referring to myself and my friend el Andrew Waltino[andrew walton for short]). But yeah, check it out, and join the forums if you'd like to, we'd love to have you :).  - urlLink Infinigeeks Home   - urlLink Infinigeeks Forums  I haven't had the time to set up the forums yet though, so I'll inform you when I do that later. Please be patient as we work on the website.   Word of the day--Recumbent:rih-KUM-bunt:[adjective] Reclining; lying down. Resting; inactive; idol.
