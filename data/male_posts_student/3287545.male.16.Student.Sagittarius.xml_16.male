Origionaly I only wanted a few people to know, a few of the girls, but the more people that know, the more chance it has of getting out, and I'm not sure how but I think it's already on its way out. I think in the long term, my gayness getting out will be quite cool, but to begin with, it'll be a right old bugger, and I'm really scared about violent reactions to the news. Arron was really nice about it today. He wrote me a note in youth club, just saying that, he knows, that he's ok with it, and that I should make sure I'm sure before it gets out everywhere, cause there'll be no turning back. I wrote a note back to him saying that I've known for a while, and that I'm happy they were all being really supportive. He's so sweet, I'm still in love with him. I hope he suddenly realises he's gay, and comes out as well, I really do. Katie is still really angry with me, and I completly understand why. I wouldn't like it if my boyfriend suddeny told me he was straight. I'm not really sure what we're gonna do about the prom tommorrow, I guess I'll just have to go with the flow.
