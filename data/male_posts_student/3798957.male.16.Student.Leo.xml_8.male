I have the most fun sitting around a table with like-minded people, playing DnD or having a lan party, that kind of thing. And, it's been working for the most part, but it always seems to chase me down. For a while, it was a problem I had because I couldn't really connect with any of my friends. Later, I realized that I had the wrong friends, and started enjoying myself with new circles. However, most of them were older, and I ended up playing witness to their misadventures. Now, I feel like I ought to try and talk about it, but I honestly have no idea what to say. I play through the conversations in my head, and nothing I say sounds satisfying. I am not used to dealing with people's feelings, not at all. Hell, not even  my  feelings. I know some people who are only my friends so we can get away with insulting eachother. And I hate to say anything of the sort, but shit, life is hard.
