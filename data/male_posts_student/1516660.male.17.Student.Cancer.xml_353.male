The first thing I noticed is that there's a big house for MaMa, even got two servants. I gave all the servants figureines names, like MingYue, CaiXia, XiaoDengZi. :P The adults are, again, looking for numbers to buy for 4D. Meow moo.  Hmm. They were preparing the 'treasure chests' thingy. While digging stuff (documents) to put inside the chests to burn, we found a lot of interesting documents like TaiMa's (MaMa's mother) birth cert, MaMa's children birth info (the respective pieces was given to the children) and even photos of YeYe (GrandDad, aka MaMa's husband). He looked so smart. His name is Yip Ya Bin (written behind the passport-sized photo). Even FeiChui hasn't seen him before. They say that his favorite grandson is Ah Meng. Heh.   After preparing the chests, we had nothing else to do le. Luckily, I brought my Discman and listened to music all afternoon. Oh yes. Reading my HZGG too.   Hmm. This time they offered to buy dinner for us. Ah Meng went to buy all our orders. I got chicken rice. We are eating at 5+, because the priest is supposed to come at 6 and start the rites.   Noticed I said supposed. He came later, and rites have to start at 7. Well, the rite wasn't special or anything. Wait till you hear about the next rite, which is due to start at 10. Sigh. We are bored again. I listened to my Discman while Father entertained his friend (whom according to Mother, introed Father to taxi-driving). Brother and I burnt some incense during a prayer.   At 10, the rite was touching. The priesta were talking about the hardhips of life, about rearing up children who are now kneeling in front of her (I didn't know most of the words, except the children part. They spoke too fast!) Their voices were carrying sad emotions, they can even cry on the spot. I think they have trained real hard. That made DaiGuMa and GuJie cry. SuZhen was tearing, and so was FeiChui. Me? I was pretty touched, but my leg hurts so much. Imagine sitting there for 30 minutes...my left leg was terribly numb.   After the rite, it was time to burn all the incense and the house and the nucais for MaMa. Yeah. YiGuMa was in shock, because she keep repeating monotonously "MaMa come get your things..MaMa come get your things.." The head priest said the burning was good, everything was dispersed. Whatever that meant. Heh.   After that, we took taxi back home. Yeah. After bathing at 11+, I went to sleep.    SUNDAY - TODAY   The chu bin. The cremation day.   We woke up at 5. I was feeling very crabby all morning, because goddmanit, this's a Sunday! I guess Friday's long rest was to sacrifice for today. Sigh. We went to Whampoa to eat breakfas.t I ate chee cheong fun.   Heh. Talk about being there puntually at 7. We were the only punctual cats there! The rest began to come at 7.30+. Yeah.   The rites began at 8. Lets skip that until the rite at 9. The final rite for MaMa. We walked around the coffin. We said our goodbyes. She looked so peaceful. (I just realized that MaMa and DaiGuMa looked alike. I couldn't picture MaMa's face without DGM's face in my mind.) The grandchildren kneel at one side, the children and spouses at the other. Then, people begane to cry. Father was one of them. All these days of pent-up grief was let out today...he cried real pitifully. I wanna go over and hug him...but this is a proper rite after all.   The coffin was then loaded into the hearse and off it goes. Dad, DaiPakPak and YiPakPak put their hands on the hearse and walked with it. Looking at PaPa, I saw him as MaMa's son. A real filial son. Yeah. After walking for awhile, we took the bus to Mount Vernon Crematorium.  Yeah. After waiting for awhile, we went into the hall. We prayed, offer incense..then it was off to the burning. The process was terribly quick. I don't even have time to react before the coffin was pushed into the burning thingy. Just...like woosh. After that, we went back lor.  We offered some incense to her plaque, then the grandchildren went down while the children and their spouses stay for prayer. I was picking rubbish around the funeral area, then I went up lor.  Sigh. The prayer was over, and he was giving instructions. Anyway, we stayed for a long while. I learnt that YiGuJiu (husband for Yi Gu Ma) is very formidable. He controlled DaiPakPak with the money (ayiah...that DPP is a big gambler..we have to control how much he takes every month, or else he will spend all the money and have to depend on us for moolah. Who wants to provide for him wor!) collected from the donations ($6000+ in total...woah!). He is very strict lor. I see him very powerful and formidable. I bet he is a strict father. He even told his wife to "diam diam" when she was making too much noise. ~Eyebrow raised~  Anyway, after that, we stayed for awhile, then went off for lunch lor. Lunch is at AMK Central. Yeah.   Coming back, I bathed then do my homework. After that, I watched my recorded tapes and then came online lor. Yeah. I ate dinner just now (duck brought at NTUC FairPrice). Here I am.  Well. My thoughts about the whole thing? There are 2 main ones.   One, this whole thing happened too fast and sudden for me to register her death. It's like...one minute I was in lecture, then the next minute I recieved news that MaMa died. Then, the days just swooped past real quick ..and barely a blink of an eye, she was cremated. I am like still in shock lor...I couldn't cry at all.... I don't know why. Am I heartless? Nah.. I still feel sad...but...I can't cry.   Two, this whole funeral affairs let me know more about my family from the father's side. I initally don't know a lot of people...which cousins belong to which aunty/uncle. I know them all, even the cousins which I never remembered meeting before. I even knew the proper names of the uncles and aunties. Heh.   Yeah. I think that's all. Woah! Such a long blog wor! Heh Heh. I think I go le. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
