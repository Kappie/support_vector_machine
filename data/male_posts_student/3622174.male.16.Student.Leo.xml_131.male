Warning, if you plan on seeing Spiderman 2 or playing the game, please, do not read on, because I'm going to go through the entire story.   The Movie: Alright, Spidey's back with an all new villain and an all new, incredibly good storyline, which kicks the crap out of the first one.  The villain is Doc Ock, and he helps Harry Osborn determine who killed his father in the first movie.  It all begins with another mysterious lab accident, in which Dr. Octavius is demonstrating how the sun can be used to harness power, with the use of his nifty little tentacle product.  But, Peter Parker determines a disturbance in the demo, so he quickly runs off, changes into his Spidey costume, and goes in, right before things start going wrong, and Dr. Octavius's wife Rosie is killed.  Dr. Octavius thinks its Spiderman's fault, so he sets out to kill him.  So when he actually catches Spiderman, he takes him to Harry, who unveils the mask...and now, Harry knows that Spiderman is his best friend Peter Parker.  This movie was EXCELLENT.  It's making me drool for the third one, but, I'm not sure when that's going to happen...hopefully within the next two years.  All I know is that now, I have a new favorite movie.  The Game: The game closely follows the storyline of the movie, but makes it even bigger by adding villains like Shocker, Mysterio, and Rhino, into it to make it a little longer.  Unlike the first game, in this one, you can websling all around New York City, which is a nice perk.  It is nicely detailed, because you can reach the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and, at Ground Zero, there are two beams of light where the Twin Towers stood.  There is so much to do.  Even after you beat the story mode of the game, you're only 50% done, because there is so much more to be completed, that you'll spend more time on that than you did with the story part of the game.  There are supposedly some really cool little addons, but, I haven't gotten that far yet.  I'm just at the final battle of the story mode.  And it is HARD.  I hope I beat it tonight!  So now, I'm going to be making some changes, the first one being a picture change.  Am I going to reveal myself to the masses?  Probably not.  But, a new picture will be in the profile beginning tomorrow.  As for my other Spidey stuff, I'm going to keep it around for a little bit, because I'm thinking about seeing the movie again real soon...  And that's it for this week's Nerdular Nerdance.  I don't know what I'll post for this next week.  But, you may be wondering: where the hell did you find the words Nerdular Nerdance?  Well...here's an explanation for ya.  I was watching the latest edition of Strong Bad Email on Home Star Runner, which is one of my favorite sites around, and Strong Bad was talking about Popular Science magazine, when he said, "they might as well call it Nerdular Nerdance."  So, I decided to steal it.   Join me later tonight for tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin', where I'll go look at someone else's blog and post stuff about it (not that I'll get negative or anything).  Until then, go do something predictable.
