Along with this, thier parents still seem to be stuck in the 80's with thier names i.e. tate, lance, and some other name that is really 80's and real gay, something like boomer (which is a cool name for a dog but not a person). I seriously wish that for one day some suffern people would just come to our school and see what hardcore ghetto is like, what its like to actually have to be somewhat humble or else some black/spanish person will get in your face/kick your ass. GOD I HATE SUFFERN. GO TZ, GO NR, GO CLARKSTOWN... BEAT SUFFERN
