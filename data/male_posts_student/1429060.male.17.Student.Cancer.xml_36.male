Five damn talented ladies I should like to say. As in each girl could play three different instruments, in addition to vocal talents. I personally enjoyed the lead singer (Julie M Fowlis) and the fiddler (Jenna Reid). God, why couldn't I marry all five of them and accompany them back to Scotland? I am American capitalist pig. I want to be Irish fluter/bagpiper Gaelic-linguist. Curse that the fates be so cruel!  Speaking of which... I have decided to become, in addition to a microbiologist, a linguist (fluent in French, Spanish, Gaelic, and a variety of other instruments) and a musician (piano, bagpipes, fiddle). Time it seems might prevent this before college, but oh well.  Listening to a divine song by the Dòchas: Waulking Song. I will track down Julie Fowlis just to hear this. I am babbling, am I not? Go to  urlLink The Dòchas , you poor soul who has not heard Celtic jigs and melodies.  I will create a time rift that allows me to return to the past and relocate my parents to Ireland for my birth. Then I will be brought up speaking Celtic and playing fiddle. And I will be content all my existence. Hopefully. (Like that will happen. I am damned as a capitalist pig.)  Cheers, mortals.
