Well, I am part of a debating club or thing that meets every thursday and tuesday. Any way, we had a debate today between two teams. The topic was "The west is our past, our future lies in the east". You can probably guess, it started off as a plausible debate which disintegrated into a politically incorrect, racist argument on whether Asians were better or Whites were better. I'd like to quote Maddox "Oops! You're a racist,".   Cheers,  Colin
