I took this by standing at the bottom of the pole and pointing the camera straight up.  In the picture, the sky looks a tad overcast, and that was the case for much of the vacation.  It wasn't all that bad, though, because it made things a lot less hot and sweaty for me, and it didn't really rain all that much.  Oh, two things I didn't mention before:  1.) I have larger versions of all of these pictures (full-screen versions) if anyone would like them, and 2.) you can get a slightly larger version by clicking on the thumbnail right up there, but it won't be the largest available size.  If you want the largest version, leave a comment on one of the posts giving me your e-mail address and telling me which one you want.  By the way, they are free.  I'm not yet good enough to charge for my pictures.  They make nice wallpapers, though.
