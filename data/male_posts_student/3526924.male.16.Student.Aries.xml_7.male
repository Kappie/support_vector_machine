This means Tenet and the CIA are taking ALL of the blame for intelligence faliures over Iraq and the WMD scandal!  CIA is being dealt a HUGE blow here!  The 9/11 commish found CIA and FBI guilty for not being very efficent, which the media jumped all over.  The media and the 9/11 commish acted totally irresponsible, and now America's Intelligence community is going to suffer for it.  Anticipate less money in the budget for CIA next year, maybe some Congressional Oversight...jeez.
