Bunch of things he does that I don't like.    1.  He requires people to partcipate in class for participation points.  Everyone is required to have 50 participation points.  That means, I'd have to raise my hand 50 times...Or, write a couple thesis papers between 1 and 1 1/2 pages long for 10 points each paper. I chose to write the papers.  2.  He got the class into a few political discussions.  If I wanted to get into political discussion, I take a political science class.  He also got the class into a religious discussion.  Irritating.  3.  He writes his notes on the chalk board, but jumps around too much to follow.  WTF?  I can't remember my 4th reason, but it'll come to me later...
