Last Wednesday, one of my dear coworkers took that to heart. He called and informed me that he had a special "white glove delivery." A few hours later, he and another coworker showed up at my doorstep with an Adirondack love seat in stow. I was so touched by his thoughtfulness and originality! He knew that I was in the process of having the backyard done...So, he decided to spend nearly 2 days to build, sand and stain this classic wooden lawn chair for us. Isn't that so fabulous? Not only did I find this gesture  the sweetest thing ever , but it was just in time for the backyard finishing touches and our 1st year celebration.

I'm hoping my sister can post a picture for me.
