Colleen and I stayed up until about four in the morning talking (XD), and there was actually some serious talking going on. :O  Even though Sensui/Sesshomaru kept trying to persuade Colleen into thinking I'm a bad boyfriend by saying I abused Hikki, Nat, blah, blah, Colleen thankfully didn't listen to that jealous bastard. ^_^  It was kinda romantic, hehe. I made a topic in the Love House forum at ADG about how much I care for her..then she told me she loved me and wanted to be my girlfriend. I'm finally happy, hehe.
