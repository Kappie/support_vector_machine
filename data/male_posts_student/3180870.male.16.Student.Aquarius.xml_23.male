Not all LiveJournal users are pre-pubescent teenagers. Well, okay, I knew that already but it also surprised me that a lot of the users were in their late twenties and older. I read a couple of the older journals and to no difference between teens and these older people, all of them except for one were still about drinking, smoking while drinking, and working while smoking and drinking. Not only that, but a lot of them seem to mention moving into the suburbs recently or how they will soon. The thought of being twenty five and living in (over used term) a cookie cutter house is one that gives me the chills. The exception to these journals was a woman named Lisa who still part takes in those activities but also exercises and keeps fit while managing to obtain scholarships to finance her hiatus to France. I'm not trying to bash LiveJournal since it's the users that seem to be so lame. I just think LiveJournal will be a very handy tool for motivation when it is most needed.     I also added a new link to my sidebar. It'll direct you to Mr. Maddox's web page, The Best Page In The Universe, and no, there aren't any quotation marks missing because it's a fact that it is the best. If you haven't already discovered this site, you should visit as soon as possible and make sure that you do read all of it, from the beginning.
