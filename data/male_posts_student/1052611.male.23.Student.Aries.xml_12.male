Though, I am guessing, I am a little over the hill for blogging (seems like the average age of the blogger is below 25).  Also, seems like the Tag board/Doodle board is a permanent fixture on most blogs. Am wondering if anyone knows the approx % of current students in IIT who blog? Are they from a specific insti, dept, hostel etc. Or is the phenomena widespread?   Also all you bloggers beware. NY Times is calling it a  urlLink serious addiction  :)  On another note, We have a feature which provides a script that allows bloggers to recommend favorites.  You can check it out here:   urlLink AiYo favorites   Sorry for the shameless self-promotional plug... But thought that it was relevant to blogging and may even be fun for ppl.
