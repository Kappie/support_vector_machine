Some people said the song wasn't that good, but I like it. Can't really judge a whole album on just one song, so I'll have to wait for the rest to come out. :/  For those that don't know, she currently has two  urlLink albums , " urlLink  Tidal  " (from 1996) and a Platinum winner (from 1999) titled " When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and if You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and if You Fall It Won't Matter, 'Cuz You'll Know That You're Right ". (yeah, that's the actual title of the album, though Amazon felt like calling it " urlLink  When The Pawn...  " for short.)
