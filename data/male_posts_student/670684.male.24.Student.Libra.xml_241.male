This FCC bullshit is disgusting, especially while in California, where I can smell Rupert Murdoch's ball stank all over local media outlets.  Michael "Neoptism" Powell had the gall to tell Jim Lehrer that allowing large media conglomerates to own more media outlets will "help foster competition" and create "the free press that the American People deserve."  If Fox can own more media, then they can bring better programming to their outlets...like Married by America and Mr. Personality.    My favorite stupider Powell comment was in regard to the large outpouring of criticism of this move...nearly 750,000 people wrote to the FCC to speak out against these new changes.  According to Powell, these people don't know what they're talking about:  "Most of the letters were very general...they didn't address every rule we changed, just one."  Yes, the one that allows media giants to own 45% of media in a community, including cross-cutting media (before, you couldn't own a TV station and a radio station, now you can own both AND the newspaper).    It sounds like congress is going to put things back the way they were...any time Barney Frank and Trent Lott are both against the same thing, its chances of going through are pretty bad.  But until then, I'm doing my best to read and watch BBC, PBS, and Al Jazeera...nothing else.  Unfortunately, that means boycotting The Simpsons.  Fuck.
