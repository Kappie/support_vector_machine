(Practically, due to geographic and political factors, the boundaries of time zones are more circuitous. In addition, a few time zones are offset by an odd number of half hours from the Greenwich and U. S. time zones.) Within the confines of each time zone, the hour and minute of the day is defined to be the same. Time zones eliminate the problem that local noon (defined according to the elevation of the  urlLink Sun ) actually occurs at a different time for nearby towns at slightly different longitudes, so that each town's clocks differ by a few minutes from those of neighboring clocks. This problem was already encountered in making up timetables for long distance train travel, but became completely unmanageable with the advent of modern air travel. Defining time zones means than watches need only be adjusted in one hour steps upon crossing of a time zone boundary, as opposed to continuously along any east-west journey.  Time zones are usually specified by the number of hours they differ from  urlLink Greenwich mean time . Greenwich, England is defined as the 0 of longitude, and is the center of the Greenwich time zone, relative to which other time zones are usually referenced. For example, U. S. Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UT - 5 hours, U. S. Central Time (CST) is UT - 6 hours, U. S. Mountain Time (MST) is UT - 7 hours, and U. S. Pacific Time (PST) is UT - 8 hours.  Almost all time zones differ an integral number of hours from GMT, but there are a number, the most famous of which in North America is Newfoundland, which differ by an odd number of half-hours. Other examples are Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and central Australia.  Unfortunately, the system is further complicated by  urlLink daylight saving time , which is seasonally inserted in some (but not all) time zones.  urlLink Daylight saving time  is in effect during summer, and is usually one hour ahead of Standard Time.   An  urlLink hour  shift which is seasonally inserted in some (but not all)  urlLink time zones . Daylight saving time is in effect during  urlLink summer , and is usually one hour ahead of  urlLink standard time . In those portions of the United States which observe daylight saving time, it is in effect from the first Sunday in April to the last Sunday of October. Daylight savings time begins when clocks are set from 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. on the first Sunday in April and ends when clocks are set from 3:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on last Sunday in October.  Europe also observes Daylight Saving Time, but the dates on which is goes into effect and ends are different than in the U. S. In particular, it shifts to daylight saving time one week earlier than the U.S. in the  urlLink spring . In the southern hemisphere, insertion and removal are inverted from in the northern hemisphere   urlLink Benjamin Franklin  was among the first Americans to discuss the idea of Daylight Saving Time. In fact, he proposed the idea while serving as U.S. minister to France as a way of conserving the cost of lighting for shops. The purpose has been to essentially utilize more of the daylight hours in  urlLink spring  and  urlLink summer  for daytime activities. Simply put, the  urlLink Sun  is up longer in the sky (rises earlier and sets later) in  urlLink summer . Clocks and common mechanical timepieces keep what's called  urlLink civil time , which roughly corresponds to the passage of a fictitious "average"  urlLink Sun  through our sky. This is necessary since the  urlLink Sun  does not  urlLink rise  and  urlLink set  on a regular basis, but changes by as much as 15 minutes through out the course of the year.
