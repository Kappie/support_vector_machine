What the fuck is goin on? I can't go to sleep Feds jumpin out they jeeps, I can't go to sleep Babies with flies on the cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep Ish bowled two sixes twice, I couldn't go to sleep Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry (?) guns (?) got, hit up with the big shit, bam-bam Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot  [Isaac Hayes] Don't kill your brother, let's love each other Don't get mad.. cause it ain't that bad Just be who you are.. you've come so far It's in your hands, just be a man Get the jelly out your spine! Cobwebs, out of your mind   I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes They shot the father of his moms, killed him seven times They shot Malcolm in the chest front of his little seeds Jesse watched, as they shot King on the balcony They spat at Marcus, Garvey cause he tried to spark us with the knowledge of ourselves, and our forefathers Ohh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots cracklin Her husband head in her hair, you tried to put it back in AMERICA'S WATCHIN, BLOOD STAINED INK BLOTCHES MEDGAR TOOK ONE TO THE SKULL FOR INTERGRATING COLLEGE WHAT'S THE SCIENCE? SOMEBODY? THIS IS TRICK KNOWLEDGE THEY TRY TO KEEP US ENSLAVED AND STILL SCRAPE FOR DOLLARS  What should I do? Grab a blunt or a brew? Grab a two-two and run out there AND PUT THIS FUCKIN VIOLENCE IN YOU? I can't go to sleep, I can't shut 'em son.. I..    I heard this song about 3 years ago with my roommate of the time (Sam, what's happen?) and we both ran to our computers after seeing the video on BET and downloaded it.  It takes Isaac Hayes' "Walk on By" from Hot Buttered Soul.  The same riff is used in some new Ludicris song, and while his rap is quote flowing, nothing beats Isaac and wu tang.  To compair this to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" cuts down the social commentary of this song, but it is like a history lesson, albiet a lot more awesome and true than Mr. I like to drive drunk Piano Man.   Warning: Obligatory Chappelle show reference: You've got to diversify your bonds...
