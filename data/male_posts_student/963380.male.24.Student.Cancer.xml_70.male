You usually get a few good ones in between, just to cleanse your palate. Not so I. Three fucking roommates in a row that didn't work out. It must be me. I don't get it - I deoderize, do most of the cleaning/maintenance. So evidently there's something utterly vile about my personality which drives regular people for the hills and the slightly unscrupulous to let's fuck our roommate land.  Then again, I could just be blowing things out of proportion and John might just want his TV at home.
