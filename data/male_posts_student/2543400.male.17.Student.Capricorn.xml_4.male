LOL! not trying to be sexist but it's true. Girls need to tell us males what they like and stuff, we can't figure it out. It's like hell trying to know a girl, another hell trying to figure out what she likes, and a third hell just to talk about the stuff they like.  :-/ Man life has so much I don't understand and never will.
