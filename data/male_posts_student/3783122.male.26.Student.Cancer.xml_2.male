Take my past two relationships for example. I was with one wonderful Canadian for almost 3 years and she all of the sudden got commitment-phobic. Then there is this last one who well she too had everything she was looking for in someone. Even her Ex said the same thing about me. (thanks Dan but that is the only time Ill day that) Just take a guess though where she is now. Yes with her Ex BF. She is going to give a guy who she broke up with a second chance but she would not give me a real first chance. I guess it is always going to be true, “Nice guys finish last.”
