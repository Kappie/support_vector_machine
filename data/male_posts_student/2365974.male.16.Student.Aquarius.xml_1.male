"another of those nights, eh?" he asked nonchalantly as he pours the liquor to my glass. i nodded as a sign of confirmation to his suspects. yes, it was indeed one of those nights. work had been a mess, my beloved has once more ran off with another love. it always seemed to be the doom of all for me in the beginning. i always found myself wasting away in this same bar each and everytime i came from a tussle.  "aye, three years it has been, young lad. still down with that dryspell of yours, i see," he picks up his stool and places it near me. pats me on the back as i took in the water of my salvation. the drink that was the temporary remedy to my melancholy. my folly. and my pain.  "pain walks hand in hand with pleasure, young man. you have to accept pain as if it never hurt you. take it from me. been there, done that."  time and time again, that bartender put up against my rants. as well as the whines of all the other drunkards that would care to share their tale. yet, i realized, if everyone has their story, what was the story of the barkeep? does he wear a mask to block out all his pain? what happened to him that he has all these knowledge?  surely, not all knew the enigma that sorrounded the bartender. not all knew his tale.   moreover..  maybe no one knew at all..    i just pictured that thing in my head as i was typing.. gahh, i'm not as motivated as before to write. i know im near to another alternative source of motivation. but i'm scared to use it as my inspiration. well, its a risk.
