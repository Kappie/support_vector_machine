She made up for all the stupid actors and performance. Ole! or whatever. I enjoyed watching everyone on the bus act all cool with their cell phones. Let me whip out my cell phone and hold it and look all cool. Some people were actually betting money on bowling games. You know. Those virtual bowling games you can download onto cell phones. The great bets we come up with. After the outstanding performance of Don Quixote, we took a nice ride down to McDonalds. Thankfully, there was a Perkins restaraunt right by it. So we went over to find that the entire bus has followed us to Perkins. Great. So me, MONtone, Murphy, Kriesher, Evancho, and Wilson get a table. Thankfully we avoided having to sit by Dave. I felt bad for making Dominic have to listen to "Why do they hate me?", "Look at my cell phone.", "Mandy sent me a text message.", "Read it.", "Again." Anyway. We sit down at our table and I don't get a menu. So even Perkins hates me. Well, we all know what we want to order. But where's the service at Perkins. Good god. We were there waiting for about 15 minutes watching everyone else get waited on except us. About 5 waitresses walked by our table, looked at us, and walked away. What the Hades man? Well we finally get served and this waitress must of been super-rememberer or something. We ordered so fast and she didn't write anything down. I was impressed. Of course while waiting for food we found the stupidest things to talk about. Which doesn't surprise me. Well we finally get our food. I ordered this shrimp basket thing. It was good until I realized half the basket was filled with (what seemed to be and what tasted like) non-edible little pieces of crap. Yet Nick ate them all. Also, Joe ordered eggs and bacon and half his plate was filled with shredded hashbrowns and he got about 1/2 of an egg white. I think they should show you a picture of what you're ordering on the menu so you know not to order the 1/4 shrimp 3/4 non-edible red, white, and purple looking things. They color coded Justin's plate with his .... his.... taco. Steak quesidilla or whatever. I found it somewhat awkward today in Perkins. A strange busboy who was cleaning up kept staring at the girls in our class. He was trying to be shady hiding behind the corner but you could tell what he was doing. A regular Charlie. So one time he was standing behind us and he came over to Joe and said, "You guys have pretty girls." in the I'm retarded and pervert voice. Then walked away with a child molesting smirk on his face. Then he went to another table and started talking to them about our "pretty girls." Then he finally went to one of the girls' tables and talked to them. By this time I was ready to get the heck out of there. But he left all of us alone then. Then I looked over Evancho's shoulder and I see some old lady with huge buckteeth staring at me. Ok now I'm scared. Occasionally I glanced over to see if she was still staring and yep. There's her face watching me eat my red tasteless strings. Then I look to my left and the one really strange girl in my class is there staring at us also. Now come on. This is getting out of hand. I really just want to leave at this point. Then we're about to leave and I make a couple comments about these people staring at us and I look to my right. There's Jimmy about to spit all his soda out cause he's laughing too hard. I don't think I've never seen such a messed up day in my life. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Perkins. Never again.  Listen to H.I.M.
