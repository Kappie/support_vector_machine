I don't like lying but I feel ok to bend the truth if the question isn't direct. However, I hate being lied to, but only when I asked the question directly. At least I'm consistent. Also regarding lies, I don't like it when I point out to people that they're lying and then they stick do their guns. It just pisses me off.  2. People who misuse the word "Fuck." Guys, it's a precious word and contrary to what many of you might think, it can be over used, or even misused. Here's a good example of something I heard yesterday: I was walking down to the bus stop when I heard some lady with a heavy jewish accent yell at me "Look fuck where the ya goin'!" as I crossed the street Boston-style. First off, it's poor grammar to use it the way she did. Secondly, if you don't know what other words in english mean or how to use them, do you try and use them to sound cool or appealing or pissed off? I didn't think so. Stop misusing a perfectly fucking good word. Fuck.  3. Shitty drivers. Dude, if you don't know how to fuckin' drive, get off the damn road. I am sick of flying all over the fuckin' bus because of some fucking chink who's thinking about some random irrelevant shit that isn't the road. I don't even drive yet and I know that as soon as you get behind the wheel, you need to focus. God dammit!  4. People who give me queer looks. Firstly, what reason do YOU have to look at me funny? I am relatively presentable, stand with half-decent posture and my chin is right where it should be; not too high and not too low... Well, sometimes maybe a little too low, but that will soon be remedied. You on the other hand, often either drive a 50k+ car and think that you're better than me because you're a superficial assfuck, or you walk by in a shirt that costs more than the computer on which I'm typing this and reek of way too much cologne. Not that any of these random jerks would read this, but seriously, don't be so judgmental. Just because I try and keep what's in my backpack worth more than what's on my body, it doesn't mean I'm less than you. It just means that I have different priorities.  5. People who rant about shit that will never get fixed. Yep, that's me. I don't like a lot of what I do... but then again, who really likes everything about themselves? Here's my flaw. I try too hard and end up not caring in the end because the goal is either just too far or... I scare people away while I try and reach it.  Thanks for reading rants.         -- Feanor  P.S. There are more interesting blogs out there. Read 'em sometime.  P.P.S. God, send me a sign and show me how to interact with all the people I want to interact with!!
