Write an informative and entertaining review of the movie.  Read a few current movie reviews before you write your review on The Right Stuff.   At the end of the movie when Gordo Cooper is asked, “Who was the best pilot you ever saw?”  Why couldn’t he talk about Yeager?  He tried and it was on the tip of his tongue, but it never came out.  Why?     What was the theme of this film? What were the film makers trying to tell us?  Were they successful?     How does the film depict gender issues?  How does it support what you know about the fifties and the early sixties?  Were you suprised by anything in the movie?
