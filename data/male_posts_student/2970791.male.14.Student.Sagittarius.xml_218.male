Yeah, well, it's time for me to say it, and for the first time I mean it. Only two years at Montgomery, but damn, best two years of my life. We have to keep this blog going, and I'm gonna start having a bunch of parties with all the Montgomery people's. Oh, yeah and cheesy inpirsation chapel speech thingy, you guys remember the barn, thats our class, awesome together but even when we are broken up made into another barn, or furniture, we are still Montgomerian's at heart, still a part of the barn. God, I'm gonna miss this school (::sniff, sniff::).
