Everything comes from the mind. Individuality is nothing more than the result of introspection. The "need" to display your individuality with useless items goes back to the void humans feel that I spoke of earlier. A true individual has come to terms, through introspection, with his gifts, and his shortcomings, and is content with who he is. Someone who feels the need to display their "individuality" to others via useless items is not an individual, as they need re-affirmation from others because they haven't come to terms with their faults.   Secondly, and this is probably a bold statement, but it looks as if you(Brian) would put misguided attempts to achieve human satisfaction over the good of our world. This is a perfect example of the human superiority complex I spoke of. The desire to create and destroy. The desire for the feeling of power, as false as the power may be. Following useless rituals created by humans to perpetuate the use of useless items never leads to contentment. It leads to stress, anger, fear, and a whole other load of negative emotions. If that brings contentment than our society is very masochistic, which would be ironic, seeing as masochism, socially speaking, is infinitely more taboo than homosexuality, which is denounced in the BIBLE.   Contentment is when you realize, there are planets, stars, living creatures I will never know of. There are people on this planet I will never meet. My actions will never affect them. Time is never ending, the amount I've been allotted is smaller than anything that has ever been discovered. My actions are less than trivial. I am no more important, and no less important than any other human alive. We are all insignificant. And since, in the end, our actions couldn't matter less, we should have a good time, and enjoy each others company, but not at the cost of our individuality.  The human lust for power, through whatever turns it has taken, whatever intentions there were along the path, has gotten us to this point. Humans did not create this planet, and to compensate for the feelings of inadequacy that brings, we make damn sure we have the power to destroy it. If I can not create, I will destroy.   Finally, I'm just going to assume you were playing devil's advocate for the part about me being apathetic. You are the one who said that you were happy to see minorities step up and take more control and power amd get more justice in the world, but not at your expense. Here's a little quote for ya,   "God give me the serenity to accept things which cannot be changed; Give me courage to change things which must be changed; And the wisdom to distinguish one from the other"   Yup, the serenity prayer. Millions of people are starving in Africa. You're much more of a realist than I will ever be, is that a thing you cannot change, or a thing you can? Maybe you could help feed a few hundred, but that pretty much qualifies as something you can not change. The fact of the matter is, as you so succinctly put it, it's not my problem. Were I in a similar situation, I would not be expecting the aid of other people. It's not their problem. There's something to be said for altruism, there really is, and hell, I can respect martyrdom to a certain point, but in order to be an individual, which you so stressed the importance of, you must find a healthy balance between caring for yourself, and caring for others. If you never take the time to be introspective, how can you expect to learn anything about yourself?
