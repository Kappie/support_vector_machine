I should really go study.  Anyway,  As I predicted last week was a very good week.  Some people said they thought it went by very slowly, but I thought it flew by.  I saw Bruce Almighty this weekend.  Everyone I went with liked it but I really wasn't too crazy about it.  There were funny parts but nothing that made you pee your pants and fall out of you chair in a fit of abdominal convulsions.  I just think I wasn't in the mood to see Jim Carey.  Who knows?  Today was fun.  Our friends from Wisconsin who were staying at our neighbors house just bought a brand new corvette.  Jim, one of the Wisconsin friends and also the owner of the corvette, took me out for a little spin.  Or should I say I took him for a spin?  I cannot believe he let me drive.  It was good.  It was fun.  I also just played nine holes with my dad.  There were these old people, unbelievably slow.  They started in front of us at the first tee.  We were tired of waiting so we went around them.  I played very well.  We finished, went home for an hour, went out to Arby's, and as we were approaching our house we see them.  They were on the sixth hole.   They were having fun though, that's all that counts.  I am going to go study.   No. Wait! Star Trek is on.  Ciao.
