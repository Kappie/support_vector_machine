Some people actually say that government knew about the event just like they knew about Pearl Harbor. As much as I hate the government... and while I believe in the heinous logic of the government, I'm somewhat hesitant to believe that Roosevelt and or Bush are evil enough to have allow for American casualties on the level of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. I think that it's more likely that certain people in their administrations knew about such things and perhaps did not let know either president know about it. Our government has many heads, and I'm not talking about checks and balances. We have the military, intelligence agencies, and various departments that control policy. The executive does not completely control their actions and descisions.  Anyway... last night I went to the Belmar with Wataru and hung out with some folks there. It was slow last night though.  Johnn Cash and John Ritter just died.... so sad.  ***
