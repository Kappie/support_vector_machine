I had to hide in the toilet for morning assembly. HaHa. I read my Order of the Phoenix. At 8 something, I came out to check...and a man was looking at me. I was like so damn  scared. I thought he was a teacher or something. It turned out that he was a cleaner! Oh! Thank my lucky stars! WQ came to fetch me later. What a long long wait. And a sweaty one too.                              The first lecture was Maths C. Woah! The teacher is not bad wor. He's funny, he's good. We did indices rule la. Quite easy wor... He got a girlfriend, by the way. That's what he told us. Oo....  There's this short little break. I ate some cup noodles, a Tom Yam flavour one. woah! I missed this brand man! I love it!   After that, I went to WQ's classroom for GP lesson. HaHa! When I told his classmates I sneaked in, all of them went "woah!". HAHA! This GP teacher hor, she marked attendance. I was so damn worried of getting caught. She never asked for my name and all that....either she's idiotic or she closed one eye. Anyway, she's such a vile bitch. She's exactly like Professor Umbridge. Behind all her sweet, innocent rules are seeds of discord, to be sowed within the class. Rules like "If one cat don't pass up homework, tha cat won't get punished. Instead, the whole class." are exactly creating disharmony of relations between classmates! So Umbridge-gy. Idiotic. She's a Mrs. Who is so unlucky and stupid to marry her? Blind. I almost got caught to attend a class of rules and regulations. Stupid right?   After that leh, I attened Physics lecture. The Physics teacher, Mr Leong, is such a goofball. HaHa. He likes The Matrix and LOTR series. He hates the army too. Yeah. These are observations made by me. I so wu liao right? HaHa. Physics lecture not bad laos la. Quite enjoyable. :)  After that, I went to the canteen to wait for Gloria coming down for her lunch (one hour later). I cannot go to WQ's CT and MT class, because both lessons are taught by his form teacher. I cannot appear there one. I read my OotP there. Ha.  Gloria they all came down, I ate chicken rice for lunch. HaHa. I revealed that I sneaked in again, not realizing that a pair of teachers were sitting next to me. Oh well! I slept for a while, and taught Huimin some AO-Maths. Sets theory ar. Yeah. HaHa.  Soon, Janet and WQ came down. Four of us went to some coffeeshop to eat lunch. Only WQ ate there, as three of us had already eaten. After that, we went back lor.  Hmm....I called the Metro. They said no positions left for temps in Woodlands. I can try being a permanent staff la. Tomorrow I am going to the walk-in interview. HaHa. I consulted Amanda on what to say. Bascially hor, give politcally correct answers (which do not apply to real life). Yeah. HaHa. I must look good you know! So meowing one!  Okay, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
