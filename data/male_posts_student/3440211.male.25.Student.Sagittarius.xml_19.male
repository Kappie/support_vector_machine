Undesired intereaction -> fridge feeling   Wendesday: Absolute shit. I can't even think clear   Thursday: Morning rock bottom. After prayer normally things look up by the evening everything is great.   Friday: Life is wonderful as I work   Saturday: Time for my-self. Time for others   Sunday: oups have to do lots of things.... but I just don't do them     Why is is always the same? Well I have made a decission and make a move on it. I should have done it earlier but I guess I did not have the energy for.  I am feeling a lot better now. I doubt it was the cumin in yesterdays rice in Thrasos kitchen. They are leaving for the holiday. Good holiday and luck to them.
