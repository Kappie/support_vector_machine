Got up and did nothing but transfer the remainder of Tyke's music to his laptop and that was fun a little just cuz he was listening to really good music but that's about it.  It took a lot of effort, jogging up and down the stairs from computer to laptop, laptop to computer.  Wow, Tyke just realized a way that would have been way easier.  Taking the laptop up to the computer cuz he could.  Then he would have just had to take out the memory key and move that two feet.  Stupid Tyke.  Well after that Tyke's mom called and he told her his spider story from last night and she laughed heartily at it and then they planned to meet to get White Lightning's emissions tested.  So he took the Volv down and it couldn't finish the test cuz the tailpipe is fractured.  So now they have to get it fixed and take it back again.  Just more wasting of Tyke's oh so busy days.  After that Tyke had even less to do.  He watched tv and did almost as close to nothing as is possible.  Then he sorta got a poker game set up with MSwa at Bondage's house.  Later he called Macaroon and went over there before they went to Bondage's.  They played some ping-pong and Tyke won the best of 3 series of games to 11 but Macaroon won the game to 21.  Then they played Mario Tennis and left.  Tyke had absolutely no luck on his side this night once again.  He didn't win a single hand until his 3rd buy-in.  He never won a big pot and one time when he had trips and finally could bet well MSwa of course had a full house so he won it and took Tyke all in that hand.  Tyke lost another 40.  He is actually going to have to do a little cutting back on the poker playing now.  It's stupid.  He hates having to do that cuz he hasn't done anything else but poker for pretty much every night since like 2 weeks ago.  But 2 weeks from today Tyke's gone.  Out the door.  Headed off to Pullman.  Still will be a blog to read but fewer mentions of the usual guests.  Kinker of course will still be there but others won't.  You know who you are.  Oh yeah, Tyke hasn't hung out with a "real girl" for over a week now.  You could sorta say one week but The Inn wsan't much hanging out.  Some short chit-chat but nothing much past that.  So yeah, it's been pretty slow in that area.  But this time is being taken by Tyke to move on and forget the past.  Not fun.  But certainly not new.  Good luck avoiding that all.
