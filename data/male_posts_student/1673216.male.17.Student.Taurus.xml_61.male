       
      I am defunctional. I am broken. Shards, broken. Shattered, broken. Precious glassware, broken. I do not work. Work, the bane of my existence, in a manner of speaking. Work, my downfall. Technology, my downfall. School, my downfall. People, my downfall. I fall down. Down, the place I don't belong, yet exist within. Within, the trap I have created. Escape, impossible. Impossible, my quest. To get back to the top. Where I belong, yet do not exist within. The top, outside the cage, outside the metal cage, outside the vinyl cage, outside the saltwater bag of organs, outside the trap. Trap, human life, crawling through the sewage, and for what? Hope, the blind man leading us deaf people through the times. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Trapped, broken, and fallen.
