The whole day.    And then I went trick or treating with Alex.  Yeah he went as the guy from GTA3 and I went as a shade (a humanoid with a black countentance and robes and a barely visible face face) with a sword.  Needless to say, some people were impressed by my sword.  Like this one old guy... but.  I'm getting off topic; not really, as this thing is about me  I think I may have one of those date thingies if I ask this one girl out.  Providing she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.  Let's hope she doesnt have one and likes me.  And shut up Alex.
