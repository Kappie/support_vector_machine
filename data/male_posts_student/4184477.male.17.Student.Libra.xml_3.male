I figured it was time to being a blog. I've had diaries and journals before, both online and not. I tend to get bored after a while, but I'm determined to keep this one, even if it is just to help me write for the university magazine.  Okay, so my name is Andy. It's currently the middle of a sweltering August and I've visited the uni four or five times. The last was a "Flying Start" summer school, to introduce some of us newbies to each other, and to the official rigmarole which is required. Interesting in its own scary way, but the social side was fairly disappointing. Most of the social activities involved large amounts of drinking. "What's wrong with that?" I hear you cry. Nothing, per se, but Sarah, my partner/girlfriend/significant other/woman/chick etc. and I are not really people who enjoy being paralytic with complete strangers. I felt that the summer school was based upon the stereotypical students, who are far from the entirety of the population of the sixth largest university in the UK. Through a couple of the later activities and the lectures, we met a few people (mostly the older student "mentors") but not the lifelong friends suggested by one lecturer. This made me panic. I'm not a classically attractive person, though I am well known for being the clown, I haven't been popular in education so far. The last time I met new people wasn't the disaster the "Flying Start" turned out to be. At a post-GCSE university taster, I met and "clicked" with a dozen or more people. At least I'm not insecure, huh?  Okay, moving on, I enjoy vampires, be it books, movies (films to us Brits) or just interesting folk law. Gothicism and its styles are some things that interest me, though the more punky ways of gothy dressing are not my thing, I enjoy the original and classic images of goth in its flowing coats and formal attire. Anne Rice and Laurell K. Hamilton number amongst my favorite authors. A more recent interest is comic books. Yep, you heard me. I've recently gotten into reading (and collecting) graphic novels from a range of titles including Ultimate X-men; Preacher; and Batman. I enjoy the lightness in comparison with the novels I am more accustomed to. They are a relief in that way, but also consist of an entertaining and entirely underrated middle ground between the visual media of television and films, and literature. There is a freeness of not relying entirely on words, without the constant criticism of SFX and acting ability etc.  Okay, so day to day, I'm pretty much living with Saz and her mother in Sheffield, about ten miles from my home town (large village) of Goldthorpe. Having felt smothered by my Nan at home, and experiencing the liberation of city life over the last two years, it was a natural progression. We all get on well and cohabit comfortably.  There is more to me, honestly. I don't know who is reading this or why, but I'll post again soonish. Please leave a message if anything I've said has interested, insulted or in any other way affected you, and I'll see you soon.
