I'll see if she wants to go to BJ's later tonight.  I got like a paragraph written today... it seems like I write a paragraph a day, rather than the 1 page a day!  Ozma on Thurs... alas Toni-Lynne and Diana can't go. I guess I might see other boardies there. The other Diana maybe?  I still need someone to go with me to the shows next week.  I think George leaves next week?  Haha... Lisa can't call me since I have a new cell number now.  Here's my problem. Once I have an idea in my head, I have a hard time letting go. I'm still thinking about things I should just forget about. It's better than it was before, but still... this applies to so many things floating around in my head right now. It's like... I never feel like things are adequately resolved. That was Hamlet's problem in a lot of respects in Shakespeare's play, but thank god I don't have the other wacky problems Hamlet did. 'Cause then I'd be really screwed up. I'm simply one who dwells too much...   ***
