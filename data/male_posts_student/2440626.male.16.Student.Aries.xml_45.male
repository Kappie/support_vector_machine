Also, I wanted to ask all of you a question: What does everyone think about me adding an author to my blog? My good friend Luc is interested in the position.  Anywho, If anyone is interested in attending a spaghetti dinner on April 3, let me know.  And I've got news for J.J., I am NOT swimming on friday. No way in heck am I gonna swim and then go take a test so I can win crappy pie. No WAY!  "If he talks to me again....."  OoOoO...Another good show to watch- "The Best Week Ever".  So funny!  Word of last week: Spongemonkey.  ::moves mouth without talking:: WE LOVE THOSE SUBS! CAUSE THEY ARE REAL-LY GOOD! ::continues speachless mouth movement::  Hey everybody, name your kids Peter Jackson cause then they will win everything he is nominated for!  I have done comedy with Fabio.  The ONLY thing Martha Stewart is guilty of is....making a sinfully delicious chocolate cheesecake.  Speaking of which, there is some in the fridge that is calling my name.  Gotta run!
