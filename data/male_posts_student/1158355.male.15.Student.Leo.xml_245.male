Pray tomorrow, takes me higher Pressure on people, People on streets Chipping around, kick my brains round the floor These are the days, It never rains but it pours People on streets, People on streets It's the terror of knowing, what this world is aboutWatching some good friends screaming... let me out! Pray tomorrow takes me higher, higher, higher Pressure on people, People on streets Turned away from it all, Like a blind man Sat on a fence, but it don't work Keep coming up with love, But it's so slashed and tornWhy, why, why? Love, love, love, loveInsanity laughs under pressure we're crackingCan't we give ourselves one more chance? Why can't we give love that one more chance? Why can't we give love, give love, give love? Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?Cos' love's such an old fashioned wordAnd love dares you, to care for people on the edge of the nightAnd love dares you, to change our way of caring about ourselves This is our last dance, this is our last dance This is ourselves, under pressure Under pressure, pressure." - Under Pressure byQueen and David Bowie
