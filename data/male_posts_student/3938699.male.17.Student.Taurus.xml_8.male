Apparently some time ago, she had a major crush on some guy, who later dumped her for someone she found to be less attractive than herself. After this 'heartbreak', she wrote her crush a fat email explaining what a horrible person he is and how he's doomed to a life of angst and suffering.   How fitting that she left me for not someone, but something. She left me to be 'free', to be capable of doing whatever she wants without fear of that bad feeling you get, knowing you've hurt someone. Likewise, I do not believe what it is she left me for is more attractive than I, so I wrote her an email, thus allowing her to experience what she did to another. To show her that she is no better than he.  " Jackie,   I hope you can accept my apology. Since Battle of the Bands I have been holding you back and doing you wrong. You're nothing but a flirt. That's all you do, you flirt then walk away. So by attempting to be your boyfriend, I prevented you from spreading your wings. Likewise, you were/are a burden to me since we first met. How foolish I was to suspect 'you' could be a girlfriend.   Jake has once told me, "you don't go out w/ someone to be cool, you go out with someone because they make you happy." In all honesty, you haven't made me happy in proportion to your ill treatment of me. You lead me on like a siren and then do an about face. You call me when you're on vacation, no doubt checking out every guy there, crying and telling me you're in love. I don't care. Don't call me, don't IM me, don't talk to me if you ever come to my bible study. I don't want you to pretend you give a shit about me.   What's more, you treat me like a platonic friend, but cry whenever I mention another girl who I'm interested in. Then, at DYC you hang on some guy and tell Sam about it. I felt a little crappy for a while after seeing and hearing about that. Could I blame you though? All I could do was weep for the poor fool you were seducing next. Maybe he just wants a 'fun' couple of minutes. I'll bet you ten bucks he won't put a smile on your face when you go to sleep.   You don't want that though. I mean come on, you flirt w/ everyone, that is what you want. No need at all to stay true to one person when you can have them all right? Well, all except one now. And don't shed any more tears over me, I don't really care, or have any desire to bear the responsibility. I figure if you'll be selfish enough to do what you have to me, I have some right to take interest in myself.   I just hope that you can find someone who will take interest in you. Someone who can put up with your capricious nature and passion for clothes. Hopefully you marry into wealth, or else you probably won't be really happy. Keep searching though, there has got to be someone out there who loves you and who makes you feel good. Someone who can make you smile, and will smile just the same when you ignore them. When you treat them like they're nothing. When you value the chase more than the catch. But as for catches, I'm the one that got away. Damn.
