Cause only owning one of something this fucking cool would be a pity. They come in metallic blue and platinum. I will have one of each, thank you.   There's been a plane crash in North Carolina. It's a bit of a relief, cause it was pilot error, as opposed to, say, a crazy fellow with some candles and an alarm clock strapped to him screaming for the justice of Allah and the palestinian people. Folks like that give good muslims a bad name. That bad name is terrorist.  Who the fuck needs an automatic weapon to hunt? Really?  Anywho. That's all for now. More later.
