I don't think Adam/Fire really cares either :)  You have to understand that we have jobs we'll have to go to, so if that isn't a big deal to you and you want to stay an extra week or so, then feel free.  I think the longest someone stayed at my place at the last meet was 3 weeks :)  For those of you who are wary about meeting people from the WEEEEB, here is a funny little comic that portrays how people are online versus realife:   urlLink     Teehee!  Click it for a bigger version :) But really - its going to be a blast.  So stop your humming and hawwing and sign up already!
