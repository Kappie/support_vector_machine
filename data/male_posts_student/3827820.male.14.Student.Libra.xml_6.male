(okay, he sucks...) After his attempt for trying to exaplin how Dolly the sheep came about...  Points to note: 1. What is that thing sticking out above the legs? Where is it pointing to? How long is it? 2. If the man is standing on ground, what about the sheep? What is it standing on? 3. Why do you think this was drawn? To explain genetics engineering or how Animal Farm and the talking animals came about? 4. Explain the big cross on the picture, which is drawn by Mr Goh.
