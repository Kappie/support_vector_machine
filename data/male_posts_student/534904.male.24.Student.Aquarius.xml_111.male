Maybe one day*  Anyway, in the meantime, here's a photo of my two bestest buddies in the whole wide world**  This is Kirra and  urlLink Neal  - She (Kirra) is currently moving house, and so here they are having a relaxing geekfest after a hard day's works packing stuff up.   urlLink    (apologies for the shit picture quality, but my camera is.. well.. shit)  So anyway - I feel extremely lucky to know these two people. If everybody were like these two people, the world would be pretty damned boring. Because everybody would be the same. But if there were just more people like these two, then the world would be a much better place, IMO    *probably never **assuming world is pretty fucking small*** ***not really
