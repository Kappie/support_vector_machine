C div, u guys werent expected to win, to be honest, but u guys really did damn well. yu bo!!! oman seems like all the pple i scold the most end up alright(read jordan and yubo). well done daojie! looks like we still have someone to carry on the ri tramp tradition after boon and jordan. better rebuild ri tramp and recreate the golden generation. shit man, ri tramp has so many legendary teams. (bigmings era, xaviers era, andy's era). a div comp was quite good. for once there were so many teams. shawn lee is pro man, i really respect him for his dedication and sheer power. sprain his ankle so badly during shi chang di still can get 9.5 for comp. shenz. andy dun feel too bad, theres still next year and if we make it to rj, we'll form a team, and its gonna be a tough job stopping us. hee.  so basically we lost the gold, we had 2 major screw ups, without which, we still wudnt have won. so there, no need to feel sad. i dun blame u guys for screwing up coz no one is perfect and i know too well how u feel. but we really showed them this year what we're capable of and next year, ri bdiv will have a damn good chance of winning the gold. im really proud of u guys more than i can say man. our moves were way sweet this year. i cant say we deserved to win this year considering how we screwed up during the comp but we definitely did look like a champion team during the warm ups. no point crying over spilt milk, and that includes me, work hard next year and u guys will own, as in seriously FOWN the competition. dun worry me and jingheng and andy will come down often(i hope) no matter which jcs we go to.   anyway this years comp has been a really good experience for me, apart from the FUDGES. ri and sji renewed our frenship and its really cool having a fren on our side.  "why ri and sji always got pple cheering for them and we dont?" overheard from some chs guy  oh well. i really dont know. honestly!!!   met many cool guys at this years comp. sean and jonathan u guys rock the socks man. comp wudnt be the same without u guys. it was really fun tokking kok abt weird gym injuries and of course, our 100 m freestyle champion swimmer. *evil laugh* its cool that we're having our gym celebration dinner together at seoul, and we'll be seeing each other alot next week.  thanks loads mingwei, xavier and alvin for coming down to support us. ure guidance has always been appreciated and always will be. i dunnoe how we would turn out so well if it wasnt for u guys being there for us when we needed it the most.  and so ends my 4 yrs in ri gym. so lets recount the memories.  sec 1: innocent sec 1. hated artistic, blardy weakling, and totally loved tramp. ended up in tramp, wonder why eh. sec 2: became quite good and everybody was expecting me to do well, went to chiangmai, lost it all. screwed up during comp and got my score slashed out. felt blardy jacked. sec 3: got over my sommer phobias and cud do a decent b routine. competed and got a bronze like in sec 2. sec 4: this year. we totally owned. training was damn fun and tramp culture has never been better. i got the same score as i did last year for a more zai tao. oh well.   our team this year has been the EPITOMY of stupidity, zainess and lameness. but above all our team spirit is really our greatest strength. only when u have great team spirit, will everyone do their best for the team, to be the best they can be. that is what matters, not some metal piece, altho like jingheng says "it would be a nice bonus"  boarding this week was equally full of SHIT. operation asshole last week, and this week....*drum roll* we present....  OPERATION ASSWIPE! today jingheng crapped, flushed twice, then it choked. din spill though so we thought what the hell, might as well be stupid. took a video of us running in the toilet and flushing the toilet till it flooded and all the shit spilt all over. hhohohohohoho. are we blardy stupid or what!? rhetorical question, but thats besides the pt. hehe. for full details, contact me for the video=)  last nite we stacked up all the trophies. so we had a tower consisting of about 8 trophies? including 2 big team trophies. cool or wad? again contact me for the pics. hehehehe.   shall post again some time later or tml. my sis gonna use. doh.
