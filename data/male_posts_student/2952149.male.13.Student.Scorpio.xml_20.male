Except for that, not one interesting thing happened today...well actually in 4th period I found out im passing math! That was cool but everything else sucked. For some reason everytime I tried to talk to Stacey today I felt really awkward.lol. Anyways, after school I went to Hot Topic at the mall and got a Led Zeppelin shirt, pants, a West Coast Choppers wristband and a Metalica wallet. Well thats about it for today.
