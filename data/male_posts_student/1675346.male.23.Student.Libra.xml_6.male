The show was simply superb and it hurts only the fact that if you like to hear a good critique today one has to look for a comedy show. Too bad that the best get banned or "warned" to mind their words. All this hiding behind excuses that Rai is a public company so that all sides have to be represented. HA! If you like to represent all sides thay can make more good shows with different sides and not copies of the "competition" (read Mediaset) aired in the same timeslots of the respective counterparts! Sabina has a great sense of irony and captured a great number of problems that afflict the Italian society today, plus she finaly showed her own great face (and figure).  I'd like to quote Sabina: "We live in curious times", too bad it's a chinese curse.  I saw  urlLink this  thread, maybe someone is still sharing the first show.
