I just found out sum pretty interesting stuff....stuff that makes me both happy and depressed at the same time. the fact that sumone loves me, and I love them. But.....we can't have each other.  I had a pretty good day up until a certain point, where my dad got home. He basically called me a lazy bum and said that I haven't "done a damn thing all summer." Then he asked me when the next ACT dates were, and I said April....then he said that I had to register for college by November, and apparently, because I can't take them fast enough...I'm not goin' to college next year anymore. stupid dad. I can still go for one semester.  Now I'm just gettin' angry, because my friends are talkin' about me behind my back...not necessarily bad things, just things they think are true....but aren't.  ARG! indeed. I don't know what to do with my life. If you have an idea....you can either: 1.)tell me, but only if it is beneficial..or a good idea, or 2.)cram it up your ass. Who do you think you are trying to control me?!?!?!?  Spense   **Everything below this line was added 15 minutes later.**  I forgot to mention the Awesomest part of my day! When I came home from Steve's house this afternoon, I found that my beaver lawn ornament thingymajigger, was moved. It was sitting in front of my door with a large piece of paper firmly planted under it. I picked up the piece of paper and went inside and read it and looked at the beautiful pictures. XP It was of course, from Molly and Kathleen, it was their own way of saying, "we care for you Spenser, and you're a stud...who likes baggy pants! There are PLENTY of fish in the sea. :-D" Ya...so...that was awesome...then the worst part of my day just happened...even worse then my dad telling me that I'm worthless. I have hurt so many people lately. Unfotunately a few of them have been on my own accord, meanwhile a few of them haven't....and boy do I feel like shit.  I'm not gonna go into detail. I'm not sure the participents would be happy if I were to mention them.  Peace, Love, Valvoline!  Spense......again.  **everything below this line was added another 15 minutes later**  My life doesn't seem so bad anymore. Love really does make the world turn. Peace Out everyone, and sleep well tonight.  Spense
