This keyboard is really noisy, especially since I'm a "pounder", as someone once said referring to my typing style.  My Buffy arrived yesterday, which is cool. It is going to bother me forever that the 1st season box doesn't match the others. No I mean it, these things really bother me. It bothers my mom too, we had a long discussion about how they should have done it.  My sister is getting into Buffy, and maybe even my mother too. We watched the first three episodes tonight while my mom was making dinner, and occasionally I'd hear her suppress a giggle. "No Mom, it's a nun club."  Everyone in my house is turning into a Buffy addict. Even my cat came to watch.  I drove the minivan for the first time yesterday, and let me just say it was actually a lot of fun. It controls a lot better than my car, which is pretty disturbing when you really think about it.  I really need some love. Anyone find someone good, send them my way.
