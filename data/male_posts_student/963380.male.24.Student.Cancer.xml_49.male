I read what is perhaps the most disturbing artical I've ever read in my life today.  urlLink There are things that make me hate being human.  I have a real problem with dismemberment and/or injuries of any kind. I think it stems back to those commercials for childhood safety that I watched when I was six or seven; the commercial with the gold "Lal" type robot that cut off it's arm then admonished us that while s/he/it could put itself back together, we can not. The extension of the violation of dismemberment is when it is not an accident. I'm not one who enjoys seeing heads chopped off in films, or limbs severed.  Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers are not enjoyable things for me; however, I do find watching them worthwhile. I find the gentleman discussed in the article in question to be one of the most reprehensible human beings on the planet (if he can still be called such - I'm not sure there's a scientific name for ghoul in the categorization of our species). There's a list at the bottom of the article detailing acts of cannibalism over the past few years. I don't condone it, I don't understand it, I don't seek understanding, I seek the elimination of these people and their like from our culture. Rehabilitation is possible for people who've been twisted by the system. I can understand a good deal of our liberal system in this country - these fuckers, however, have to go. Utter removal from the gene pool is almost too good for them. Apparently there is a canibalism subculture. It needs to be found and destroyed. You're  eating  another  HUMAN BEING  for FUCK'S SAKE. There are no excuses or reasons for this sort of behaviour. FUCK.  On a lighter and less protein powered note (see, I do have my sense of humour, still) - Nemesis (or Nemisis, as it appeared on my ticket) was great. I wrote a full entry on it and when my internet connection (more on that later) timed out, I lost the whole thing. Note to me, Copy all entries before publishing. Moving back onto Nemesis - better than Nine, not as good as eight, better than seven, as good as six, what's five?, better than four and three, nothing can be as good as two and one isn't really even from the same series. Patrick Stewart makes bad dialogue sound good. The rest of the cast, however, does not. Worf seemed a little goofy and slightly underused - along with most of the cast. Hopefully the next one will be a bit more of a group effort - it's great to have almighty space battles, but you've also got to have the one thing that makes Star Trek "Star Trek" - the human element. This film had it (I nearly cried at the end) but it just didn't seem to be enough. On that note though - there was a moment between Geordi and Data - completely silent - it spoke volumes of both characters and it spoke volumes to the audience. Brilliant acting and direction all round right there. Oh yeah, and Picard ramming his ship into Shinzon's? Fucking inspired.
