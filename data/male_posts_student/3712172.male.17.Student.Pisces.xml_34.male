I just simply surf, and when I feel like posting, I click the BlogThis! button on my links bar, type away and click publish when I am done. Blogger, you truly make life simpler... :P  So today went very well. I went to the mall with Andrea. I got some CD's today, and it's probably been the first CD's I have purchased in about 3 years. I have over 150 mixed CD's and all of them are burnt. But today I wanted a change. I bought Janet Jackson's new album Damita Jo, and her older album Rhythm Nation since the one I got along time ago got all scratched up and ended up in the garbage. I also bought a Euro Trance pack that came with 4 CD's. The music is awesome too, was a good buy I'd say. After I hit up HMV, I went to American Eagle, and spent 70 bucks on a shirt and shorts. Just a bit expensive, but I don't care as I have a nice cheque coming in on Friday, might as well enjoy my last 300 dollars or so. And I mean the clothes I bought were good looking, so I figured, why the hell not, eh? :)  Afterwards I helped out at the new house today, we brought a bunch of boxes and stuff from my house, and unloaded them at the new house. We also hauled a bed up in Current River from my moms boyfriends house, and unloaded that to my apartment. Was a big job considering box springs don't like to bend down narrow stairways :P  I wanted to post a poem I wrote last night since it's been a few days since I have done so, I wrote it last night while I was talking to Allison about some personal stuff. Enjoy   Love Succesion  Whispers of success Succession of the heart Together we can be Never again to be apart Loving for the moment Caring for the time Sensual experiences You are truly mine Heaven's door is open I am grateful for the day When I feel I love you I know you're here to stay Friction of achievement Failing to be the best Will it work or not? Put me to the test.  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk   And there you have it, my day in it's own post. Interesting, yet weird at the same time. I used to think journals and diarys were pointless, but I have completely changed my perspective on that. It's such a good thing to have.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site    urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Anyway, I am gone, talk to you all later :)
