They start out being some sort of wigger mix of rap and rock and then they go into some shit with that guy from Staind or whoever all soft and sad and mellow back to some other genre of music.THEN! THEN! They go and cover one of the best songs The Who ever wrote, sang, and performed. And not just that they did it but they made it sound like absolute horse SHIT. So it adds another little personality to the ever morphing band of sucky ass people. You see the video and they want you to be all sad or whatever, yea they have a lot wrong in their lives boo fucking hoo. You jacked a really good song, made it sound like fucking rubbish, and WORST of all you make everyone who had never heard the song before like it. To you Limp Bizkit I say  FUCK OFF  and to those who enjoy their version of that song I say you don't now what music is, and finally to those who have heard both and like Bizkits version better I hope you suffer the most fucking, violent, humiliating, public, vain, torturing, and painful death right now.
