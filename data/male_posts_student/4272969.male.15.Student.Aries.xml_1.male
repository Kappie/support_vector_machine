I always get to lazy or to bored half way through the book and just look up the ending on spark notes, but today that changed. I started reading a book called Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown. Brown is most famous for his book The Da Vinci Code. I started to read the Da Vinci Code but it was one of the most confusing books I have ever touched. Digital Fortress is a mystery/thriller book about the National Security Agency and their encryption machine that has worked for decades and one day it faces a code that it can not break. In less than 12 hours I read 200 of the 375 page book which is a record for me. I hope to finish by tonight and I have purchased another book by Brown called Deception Point. Dan Brown is one of the best authors I have ever read an plan to read more of his books.
