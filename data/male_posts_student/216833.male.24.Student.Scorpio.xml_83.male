No fluffy white turtles meandering across the deep blue background - just clouds.  I have been hard pressed for a creative idea, something to build esp. after all the breaking I have been doing.  Being constructive is like a dream to me - a goal I feel I should achieve at all times, but for the most part I do nothing to get me there.  For example, I am at work, I have tons of things to do, but I can't really do anything about it here.  So I sit, and grow a farm of hemroids(joke).  I am going out of my mind some times - I swear.    I need to build something - like a bench or something.  I wish this blogbuddy had a thesarus - I would use fancier words.  wink wink ;)
