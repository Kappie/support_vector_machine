But I'm playing along to "the girls of porn" by Mr. Bungle on Jon's 5 string bass.  Friday was fun, after school, me and Dave met Louise, Helen and Rachel and went to for coffee, which lasted a suprisingly long time - until about 7, much fun was had by all. Although Helen didn't get the shoes she wanted.  Didn't do too much yesterday, had theory and clarinet as usual, which was why I didn't go to Soho with Brooke and Louise.  Today I have nothing on, so I'm play gunna video games, and computer games, and waste time on the internet, like now.
