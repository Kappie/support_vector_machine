We were playing Othello (which is a badass game) and then he told me about the G.I. Joe videos everybody has been watching lately.  I decided to look for them on Google, and behold, they were there in all of their glory.  All I have to say is HOLY SHIT, those are the funniest things I've ever seen in my life, and I'm not even joking. If you haven't been exposed to them, then you haven't really lived.  What they are are the educational segments at the end of G.I. Joe episodes, but the voices have been dubbed over.    http://www.ebaumsworld.com/gijoe.html http://www.fenslerfilm.com/?sec=video  Go to the website right now and watch the videos, because they're funny as hell. Make sure you watch them from the bottom up though, because those are the best ones.  Note: After writing this post, several people have made it evident that Fensler Film, the original creators of the movies, have a complete collection. They, of course, were right, so I'm putting their site on as well. Keep in mind, however, that it's harder to find a specific clip on the Fensler Film site, even though they have them all.
