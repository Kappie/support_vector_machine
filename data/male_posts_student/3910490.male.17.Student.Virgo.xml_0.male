As I have told most of you I will not call much during my stay, and writing e-mails back and forth will only keep me back home. By using this form of communication I can let you all know that I am still breathing, and I can read whatever goofy comments you make about my posts. That way there is no direct communication and I can go on living my life as a Nederlander. This is a public blog so save personal stuff for e-mails, but comment as much as you like on what's going on. I will respond to e-mails every few weeks or sooner if it is urgent. I know that may seem harsh but that is just part of the program.        This blog is meant to be a window to the life of an American learning to be a Dutchman. I will update it at least once a week with pictures and stories of life in the Netherlands, or wherever my travels take me. The Netherlands is situated a short train ride away from alot of major places in Europe (London, Paris, Brussels, etc.). The city Iwill beliving in, Zutphen, is about65 miles (105 kilometers) southwest of of Amsterdam.   Iwill beliving with a family (mother - Jannie, father - Imko, brother - Sander, two sisters - Renee and Laura,and a cat - Kyra), and going to an art school called the Vrije School. I leave for this new life 6 August 2004.       I would like to thank everybody at Youth for Understanding ( urlLink www.yfu-usa.org ) for giving me this opportunity and always being so nice, Val Overbey for seeing me through every step of the way (without you I would not have had enough courage to do this), Susan Overbey for scheduling doctors and dentists appointments and helping me gather all the things I needed for this journey, Michael Glick for easingalot of the fears I had, and all of you who have told me to go for it (friends,family, faculty, co-workers, random peopleon buses, everyone)your support means more than you'll ever know. I hope you all enjoy this site. And yeah, I will miss you all too. But I can't be worried about that, there is too much fun to be had. So until I see you all again -        Peace  Love,    David
