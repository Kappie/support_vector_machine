Oh well, less moaning, more pretending to revise... Lol, Dave smacked you in the eye? was it like a girly smack? I hate being hurt in the eye, it's never FUN! I went to watch Twin Wars at the school today, two hot, sweaty extremelly attractive twins fighting each other? (Might I add they were MALE!) It was pretty damn good...
