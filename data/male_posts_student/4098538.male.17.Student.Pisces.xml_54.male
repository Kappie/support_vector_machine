Went to Rockworld with Mandy on Thursday night but I regret that. We had a silly argument and ended up temporarily breaking up. It was so upsetting. We left Rockworld without a single penny. Therefore we were trapped. Luckily I saw Jenny walk past so I lent some money to get back into Rockworld. Mandy and I were talking about why we should break up and then I kissed her for about 10 minutes and it was SO nice and perfect! We ended up realising that we didn't wanna lose each other *cheeeeeeeessssssseeeee!* and got back together! Yeahhhh mateeee! Then I had to find Ashleigh and lend some money off her for the bus. I lent lots off my friends from college on Thursday and I feel all guilty! But it shall be paid back! Yesterday was an amazing day too. I had my graphic design interview at college and I was really nervous... didn't think I'd get in. But the guy said my work was the best he had seen(!!!) and as long as I pass my art course I will DEFINATELY get in! Plus he said I will be at a massive advantage to everyone else because I have used most of the stuff they use on the course before! So, yeah! Next 2 years of my life are planned now! AND, Mandy got me the 1st Chimaira album, woooo! Also, Mandy and I got Download tickets! FUCK! Ok, er, sorry, but that is so exciting. I get to see Slayer, Metallica, Soulfly, Machine Head, Slipknot, Damageplan, Ill Nino, Soil, Hatebreed, Drowning Pool, Cradle of Filth, Korn and so many other bands... it's insane! Plus next month I am going to see Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, God Forbid, Shadows Fall, Exodus, Re-Aktor and Hatesphere at seperate shows! How amazing is June?! I think I am gonna die. Then we went to the pub and I got fairly drunk, woo! We were playing pool with some Iraq dudes and I won EVERY game I played! 'Cause I'm 'well mint' at pool! We went to the cinema after that with Mandy's friend Will and his girlfriend, and saw Van Helsing. I didn't really like it. The graphics were pretty dodgy and it wasn't really my thing. We went back to Mandy's and spent a few hours just lying there, watching TV. That was the highlight of the day for me. Well, I think I am needing me a shower right now. Gotta go to town and meet Gav 'cause he said something bad happened last night at the Incubus concert and he wants to talk about it...
