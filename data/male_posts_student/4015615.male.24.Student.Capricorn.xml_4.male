Needless to say this kind of habit was widely disapproved of during "the best years of our lives" by one saucy Italian in particular.  "Why don't you go out? YOU NEVER GO OUT!"  "I dunno, I think I just want to watch Requiem for a Dream again."  "I can't believe you. You know, Rick really wants you to go. He said so."  "He did? Ehhhh, OK, let me get my dancing shoes on."  But somehow, I've been to more parties in one year of grad school than I attended during my entire tenure at Emerson and this summer I've been heading out every weekend to new cities and orifices to have a good time. So, despite what some linguini-sucking, bocce-ball playing, jump-rope-using fuckasses might tell you, I've been more active than a venereal disease at Rutgers lately. But last Friday I decided that, hey, why not stay in old M-town this weekend and relax with the rubes? It's been so long since I've been harassed by drunken red necks and called a "queer-ass". So there it was, a veritable cornucopia of opportunities for entertainment in M-town lying before me like a Jennifer Lopez  urlLink Thanksgiving .  My roommates, the mathematician and the Kenyan chemist suggested we go GALAXY BOWLING (AKA black light bowling, aka the Right-wing conspiracy's brilliant tactic to co-opt Dark Side of the Moon)! The mathematician, Barney, checked the web site for prices and times and found out that the lights go low at 10:30...and so do the prices! 3 hours of bowling for 10 bucks!!! Anyone raised in the burbs can back me up on the sweetness of this deal. However, past experiences have taught me that with glowing balls and Floyd on repeat come legions of pre-driver's license teens.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Bo Jackson and the Raiders imbued me with a "commitment to Excellence" so I wasn't about to let some pock-covered shit with crew-cut pubes beat me to the lanes, I wanted to get there right on time. After some twists and turns through some anonymous nighttime town, we pulled up to T-Bowl.  T-Bowl's exterior serves as an example of what the U.S. might have looked like if the Soviet Union won the cold war. The crumbling outer walls were faded pink and neon green, not unlike the color of Valentine's candy hearts. The parking lot was empty...strange, I thought, maybe the teens are still out back sucking down grain alcohol.  But what the exterior lacked in refinery the inside made up for in (absolutely no) ambiance. I can safely say I've never been so sure that I was gonna have a bad time immediately after walking into a place. Maybe 3 lanes were being used. One was occupied by a couple guidos and their skinny girlfriends who were fiercely and meekly (respectively) tossing their balls down the lane. Then, off in a corner of the place, some kind of family was making the rounds between bowling and playing those claw-prize games which were strangely overrepresented, totaling 5 in all.  Oh, and there was no black lights on. In fact, this bowling alley was more lit up than Dope Jacob on Dope Jacob Day. This wasn't right at all, surely the morbidly obese clerk would remedy this situation post haste!  "Uh, where are the blacklights, the web site said that black light bowling started at 10:30."  "We need to update the web site."  "Could you turn off the lights, I mean there's like no one here."  "No, uh, this is family hour...and it's 10 for 2 hours."  This is when one of the subtle nuances of the craptacularity of the suburbs came into play...if this were the city, we'd be out the door and into the nearest gin joint making fun of that tittied clerk over some libations, but when you drive for 20+ minutes into an area where the only other option for fun would be pissing on brand new Kia's, you got no options.  So bowled we did. The lanes were so greasy that every time you got your beaten-up ball back it would be covered in lube. Big black lubed balls: not hygienic. It also made for shitty bowling, your ball didn't seem to roll as much as it did glide down the lane, and more often than not it went right into the gutter. Moreover, the place was falling apart like a  urlLink Danza  comeback.  Not even entering a wacky handle on the bowling computer could save this night because every time you might be able to laugh at "Kenyan Thunder" you were instantly depressed with an ad for "The Best Birthday Party in the Universe at T-Bowl!!!"  After the guidos had taken out their Zitti aggression and the family in the corner had one enough stuffed animals to fill another teen girl's bed with tragic prizes we were the last ones left. The clerk then began some hardcore bowling in an adjacent lane that caused him to sweat in odd places: his forearm, shoulder, haunch...  Well, I'd had enough, it was time to go back to my world of cocaine, Gucci, and liberal moral relativism. Speaking off, tune in next time for Hartford strippers!!!
