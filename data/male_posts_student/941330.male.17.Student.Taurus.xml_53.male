(wait, don't answer that)  alright, my summer's pretty dull right now. we dropped my bro off to go to some band party thing in morgan hill (my bro out of the house past 10 pm *sniff* how he's growing up so fast...damn he's gonna be taller than me soon), then we got harry potter woot woot. soo big, but soo awesome. i even saw barbara pass by...haha that was cool, she was on vacation from diamond...something and i somehow ran into her. with that one guy me, alex, kevin etc. played football with during girls' tennis (not the white guy that broke kevin's finger and screwed him out of soccer).   today was ish except for going to owen's house to play games with the "homies" *simran's "it's monday f00!!" sign* i pwned with sheik, but got killed as dr. mario (damn owen and his samus charge shots). kevin: "it's not who you use, it's how you use him." kevin after dying first: "maybe it is who you use." timesplitters, nothing beats watching a monkey punch a player to death. "memory card? how about...forget card!" matrix, adam got excited about the niobe/persephone kissing scene but the rents were around. poor guy. viewtiful joe is REALLY FRICKIN COOL. it's matrix-y...except it isn't...almost worth buying a new gamecube just for the demo. bball was so funny but stupid, i felt really sluggish cuz of the extra sleep i've been getting, weird...erik tried to catch a ball that bounced in front of him and it hit him in the face...pat grabbed the ball and ran to the monkey bars, but he almost slipped off the slide...a boy was playing with an rc car and it fell into the tanbark so adam and kevin and me started spontaneously laughing...o yea, all you guys gotta come for a hypernet party. $3 an hour...so bring your life's savings or something.   then we left, and erik nearly forgot his hp book. how many people have harry potter: me, erik, jen, jenn, claire, amita (will), pat, kat, abdullah, ankur, jenny wu, elyse, joann, tina...am i missing anybody...o yea, and the rest of the general human population.
