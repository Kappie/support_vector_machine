I wouldn't really know considering my last relationship was in 5th grade, which really doesn't count. Anyways, love is crazy. You like someone, then you basically wonder if they like you for a long time. Then if you have the guts, you ask that person out, you either get one of two extremes. On the one hand, they could say yes, and that would be great. On the other hand, they could say no, and then you get really depressed. Then, if they do say yes, you eventually break up, well, at least in high school, and then you become depressed. Oh well, in high school, 9/10 relationships don't last that long anyways, but it would still be nice to go out with someone though. I just had to say write this because I have been thinking about this kind of stuff for the last hour and I have a really bad head ache.  later, bradleyJ
