Honestly, every damn time I try to interact with people it just ends up shoved up my ass. *heavy breathing* OK, I'm better now. A little explanation, but not enough to embarass anyone but me. I've hurt my girlfriend (dare I call her that?) emotionally. I asked if she could pay for her prom ticket. I was worried something like this would happen. I discussed it with my family and my parents agreed it was logical to ask her to chip in since the tickets cost $32. Look, I have some money and make some more on my paperroute. I even admit I've saved up quite a decent nestegg in my bank account. But, damn it, that money is for college! I'm trying to enforce some fiscal discipline, and I get screwed. No blame is to be placed on my girlfriend. This is one of those unspoken laws of courtship stupid people like me must learn through trial and error. I guess this is just one of those damn learning experiences, you know, like when you cut off your fingers.  Went to the Job "fair-thing" today. Mandatory, much like other useless dribble in my school life. To be completely honest, I did enjoy it a bit. It got me out of school, let me see a couple colleges I didn't notice, and eat free food. The actual job part was pointless. I know what I want to do with my life (missionary work) and no pansy-assed fair will turn me from that, thank you very much...Makes me wonder just how Christian I've been throughout this post. *sigh* Life sucks now, but I'll get over it.
