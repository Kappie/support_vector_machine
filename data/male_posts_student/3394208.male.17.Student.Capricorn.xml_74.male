I was outside the bus terminal waiting for a friend of mine. I remember it so vividly… I was there with my pen and notebook as usual sketching down whatever visions I’ve been receiving in this deluded head of mine. It’s been only four minutes but it felt as though the whole day went by and still, I hadn’t put down anything on this old Maui and Sons hardbound notebook. I decided to take awhile off so I split, sent Horry a message through my phone telling him we’ll meet up tomorrow instead. Walking these dirty streets, my head still throbbing from a hangover, I noticed the sun set early I didn’t see the orange filled sky it was just plain… dark… “Damn, Christmas is drawing near…” I thought to myself. After realizing, I stopped to check my wallet, see if I had enough money to buy gifts for my friends or family… Fucking broke. I only had enough cash to get me home… Then for a moment I thought to myself “what am I worrying about Christmas isn’t here till three more months” I put my wallet back in my back pocket. Walking steadily, trying not to fall asleep. My phone started ringing.  I answered the phone. “ Hey! Bro, look I can’t go out man, my car got wrecked last night on the way home…” It was Horry… “ I ‘m really sorry man but there ain’t nothing I can do right now I’m broke and please bro I just can’t go…” I could tell he was lying, cause I heard the laughter of one or two girls in the background… “ Look, Horry, bro, I told you to meet me there cause I’m fucked up right now, didn’t I tell you! Plus you could’ve just told me you were fucking some hoes you didn’t have to lie to me…” Horry apologized and I told him I’m going home alone. I’m one patient guy but if I’m not feeling well my patience is just a piece of thread that an insect can easily tear. My mind went a blur after that short and meaningless talk over the phone. I started once again on the long way home… then I decided to turn, stop once again and call a friend of mine. As I dialed the numbers on my phone I had a short flashback of what had happened last night.  I was at Cherry’s place at around 6:00 p.m. setting everything up, laser lights, the foam machine, everything… I walked around in her patio telling my underlings where to put where… it was the first time I was asked to host a party, and usually I never hosted parties, but I threw great ones… it was all going as planned, we installed a couple of Bose speakers to the living room, set the den as the chillout room, every room was a make out room, and the fucking patio was a great site. It was around 9:00 p.m. I had my first shot of Jose Cuervo, just sitting alone till Cherry sat next to me by the bar. I asked about her expectations for this party. Cherry replied with a smile and a flirtish glare that made me weak in the knees.“ So tell me, do you think I’m missing anything?” I asked Cherry while I took another shot of tequila. “ I don’t think so, actually I’d like to say thanks for doing this for me, I couldn’t find anyone else to set the place and host it…” she leaned over and gave me a soft kiss on the lips, I took another shot and strolled off to the gate leaving Cherry by the bar. I didn’t expect her to follow me; I just wanted to enjoy company alone. I’ve no intentions in fucking a good friend of mine… That night Cherry wore a dark red, spaghetti strapped blouse exposing a bust of 38 c’s that would make any man’s jaw drop, she just passed by me trying to put fantasies in my head, well some did pop in there. It was around 10:15 the place was swarming with familiar faces and new ones… all to which I was surprised of, for they praised me for the set up and the sounds…  10:15 p.m. all these people just started pouring in I thought fuck I’m going to get a lot out of this party. I started mingling around, when I saw one of my old girlfriends, Melanie, I remember this girl just loved it up the ass, too bad she turned lesbian after we split up… I couldn’t resist so I came up to her, over the loud music I shouted “ Hey Melie! Long time no see… how’ve you been?” I waited and tried to get her attention once more. After a few more tries I started thinking, fuck she isn’t going to talk to me so I started to walk away… I took only a couple of steps when I felt someone grab my arm. It was Melanie she just smiled and spoke some words that I could barely hear, so I pointed to the glass door leading to the garden. She smiled and nodded, and told her friend to wait inside. As we pushed our way through the crowd to get to the door, I bumped into Horry, he glanced at me and saw Melie… then he drew me close to hear him, “ Bro, don’t tell me you’re going to start fucking Melie again?” he gave me a slap on the shoulder, as I walked away. I could here him shouting over the music saying “ at least introduce me to her lezzi Friends Bro!!” I just laughed… damn Horry is just one fuckin’ horny bro.  We reached the garden, I took my shoes and socks off cause I thought it would be a trip to feel the grass with bare feet. I was surprised that Melie also did the same thing; we walked around till we reached the gazebo. I started the conversation asking her how she has been since three years ago. She just laughed and glared at me for a second “ Oh, me I’ve been doing well lately, I’ve finally finished my course on Architecture and I’m planning on moving to Australia soon…” as she continued I couldn’t help but just stare at her. I kind of missed the days I was with her, my hand caressing her soft creamy skin, her long blonde hair and those soft lips that touched mine everyday. Hey she was great company and a great fuck. “… And then I guess that’s all I got planned for me, What about you How’ve you been?” she finally stopped. I simply just said. “ Me, I’m doing great, I got my life back somehow. I just can’t help thinking of one thing….” “What is that one thing?” Melie asked me with curiosity “…what if we were still together, do you think you’d ever become a lesbian?” she just laughed at me, I know I just asked a stupid question, and that gave me away… “Well…” she replied, “ to tell you the truth I was always a lesbian I just wanted to try dick for a change, especially up my ass… he he...” from then on we told what’s been going on and I was still trying somehow to get in her pants once more, with more bedside humor. Well as the conversation dragged on I noticed that the air had been much cooler and the music started to fade, it was the time that I had to officially start the party.  I told Melanie it was time for me to get the party officially started so we left the gazebo and went separate ways when we reached the glass door leading to the dining hall packed with people. Before I headed to the DJ’s booth I stopped by the bar and downed four shots of tequila to drop the fear of talking in front of crowds and I also brought a bottle of beer along with me. The bartender Edong glanced at me telling me to take it easy on the drinks, cause the party barely started and I’m drinking like a fish. I disregarded the advice and took another bottle. I stood up from the bar ready to make my party opening speech to the people, as I reached the booth I could see Cherry walking through the crowd to the DJ’s booth. It was a beautiful sight, well for a drunk like me, imagine a beautiful girl that could easily split these mass of people without pushing them or speaking to them, she was like a walking crowd repellent, or maybe my thoughts were already messed up… as she got up there with me I could barely take my eyes off her, I was once again thinking fantasies in my head, but I easily snapped out of it telling myself that it’s the alcohol that’s making me feel this way… it was already 11:24 I motioned the DJ to kill the music for a second… as he did, I stepped up to the microphone… fuck I was once again surprised as to hear some of the people in the crowd just call my name, when I didn’t even do, or say anything yet… I took a sip of my beer and began… “ Aiyyo I don’t know how the fuck you guys know me, and why you guys like me, but that’s cool…” Cherry stepped back a few steps and laughed. “ Anyways we all know why we are all here aren’t we?” I drank some more from my bottle; I could already feel my face getting red. “ We are here to party, to smoke dope, to fuck the police and their motherfucking laws, to get laid… but most importantly we are all here for Cherry’s added year in her life let’s give her a holler people!!! And let’s get the fucking party started!!!!” these guys just went crazy after that frickin speech… Cherry went up to me and gave me a kiss and threw me down the booth along with her. All right that shit was fucked…  Lying on the floor with her on top of me, with bits of pieces of glass and food piercing my back, I just noticed how much this girl liked me… she stood up and motioned me to walk with her outside. I stood up brushing of the mess from my back; she took my hand and snatched a bottle of Cuervo in the other. I once again found myself walking through this mass of people but now with much ease and with Cherry leading the way, It felt like a dream sequence, from one of my acid trips… as we reached the glass door hand in hand, she moved her lips and started pointing to the wooden bench, assumingly she wanted me to sit with her, and so I nodded. I could tell she was planning to do some crazy shit to me, or was it the alcohol doing the thinking for me again? I slid the glass door with a force I forgot to check, it hit the edges hard almost causing it to shatter; I faced Cherry and flashed a smile of embarrassment. She just flashed me a flirtish smile and didn’t even mind if I almost broke the door. At this point I could already feel the heavy buzz of tequila and beer; and the music was already getting to me. You know I almost lost my mind… it was The Chemical Brothers playing, the track was The Test; my head was throbbing harder now pounding each time I heard the bass… but now I’m home and I’m free… if Cherry wasn’t there I’d already lost my composure and start fucking up the place. We walked till we reached the bench; she smiled again. I noticed that this girl just loves to smile; her lips always curl up forming a perfect smile. And her eyes always gave off an honest yet deceiving look; that would make a guy wonder what’s going on in this girl’s head…  I slid down the bench beside her, twirling the bottle of beer in my right hand. I could feel her eyes watching me, it felt as though the sun was focusing its rays on me keeping me warm, or trying to burn me up. So I glanced back at her. Her long black hair just hypnotized me, the way it fell on her face, making her eyes much more seductive. Trying to battle these thoughts, I started a conversation… “ So… what’d you think about my opening speech?” she swayed to the left laying her right elbow on the edge of the bench, twirling her hair and was thinking of a response. “ Well… you forgot to use what you had written on paper, but that was cool you still kicked it off pretty well.” That was right… I did write what I was to say to kick off the party, I must’ve forgot. I drank what was left in the bottle, and motioned Cherry to pass the bottle of Cuervo. “ I thought. Hey it’s best to say what I felt about the party, and it would’ve been awkward if I whipped out a piece of paper reading it in front of the peeps.” I told her as I reached for the bottle. I was trying to cover up my little mistake. She looked at me and giggled “ you are still trying to be cool eh Mr. I’m The Bomb” after I took my shot from the bottle I passed it back to her, and laughed as well… she took a shot and glared at me once again, smiled, and leaned down and gave me another kiss. I once again had thoughts about what was going on, receiving images of her and me in the bedroom stripping off that blouse and caressing those size 38 c cups… how I wish that shit would come true… I stood up abruptly; my phone was ringing, the vibration in my back pocket startled me. I asked Cherry to excuse me while I answer the call…  I stepped over by the pool where the least noise was. It was Rachel; she has been looking for me… “ Chris, Where are you?” she sounded worried and pissed at the same time… “ Rachel, I’m hosting a party for a friend of mine, remember Cherry? …” she raised her voice a tad bit, and I could hear the blender start in the background… “ Cherry? Yeah, I remember her… why didn’t you tell me?” She said, “ I did… didn’t I?” I replied trying to get my head straightened out. “ Look baby, I’m sorry it must’ve slipped my mi-“ she cut me off retorting “ look Chris if I’d known I wouldn’t have been looking for you and calling you… just be sure you get back home tomorrow, or it’s over!” she put the phone down on me. Rachel and I have been together for only a few months, but she feels as though we were already married, I don’t understand why some girls are like that, jealous and always breathing down my neck, always wanting to know what I’m doing, and easily get pissed off when I mention I’m with another girl; maybe they know what I’m up to… I shrugged it off, and went back to the bench to look for Cherry. I wanted to forget about the call; it would just ruin my night… I passed the numerous bodies that were lying by the poolside, it reminded me of a scene in one of those teen movies I forgot which one but it was exactly the same; the bodies on the ground drinks everywhere and people making out in the dark corners, loud trance music coming from all sides… I reached the bench but I didn’t see Cherry there instead I saw a couple sipping drinks and having a light conversation. “ Fuck it, I’m going to the bar get myself another drink” I thought to myself. I once again stepped into the dining room it was less crowded, the time was at around 11:45… it was easier for me to get to the bar, without all the peeps pushing around no more.   I saw Horry trying to make some moves on some Chinese looking girls, I could see he was doing a good job, the girls were smiling that’s a good sign, another was they were exchanging words… I sat away from where Horry was, and asked Edong for a glass of whisky… Edong passed me the bottle and told me to take the whole thing instead, I thanked him and made my way to the living room where I set the beanbags, I thought I could just enjoy my bottle of whisky there… at this time Chicane was being played, Daylight, damn this DJ knows what I listen to…. my head throbbed harder as I lounged around, I slouched down in one of the bean bags, bottle in hand enjoying the sounds and the buzz I was having… when a familiar face stepped into the living room. It was Sancho in his usual blue Pornstar shirt and khakis, always carrying his pouch, which is most of the time; filled with drugs… he passed by and motioned me to follow him. I was back at the bar, Horry already went upstairs with one of the chinay girls, and I ordered a glass of vodka for Sanch. Edong took one look at Sancho and gave him the bottle of vodka, not the glass… he did the same thing he did to me to Sancho. “ Yo Edong! Why are you giving us the bottles bro when all we want is the glass?” I asked Edong in curiosity. “ You guys are heavy drinkers, I can tell and don’t worry it’s all paid for, don’t you remember?” Edong told me in reply. “Oh, yeah right.” With that being said, Sanch and me made our way to the poolside.  I grabbed a magazine from the coffee table in the living room, and stepped out to the poolside with Sanch. We whipped out the bag of Chronic from his pouch. Beautiful stems and tiny green leaves that gave off a musky smell. We then peeled and shredded the leaves on the magazine as not to waste any, Sancho ate some seeds in the process, he said it would fuck him up earlier, this guy. After we got the leaves set, I whipped out the Rizla from my pocket and rolled and packed it tight with my make-believe rolling machine, which was a hundred peso bill. The ritual was almost complete, we were just waiting for one more element… The Bitches.  Sancho and I had the joint set up we just waited for one more thing and that was Andrew our best friend pimp to hook us up… we were conversing about how the world would’ve been a better place to live in if people in the government didn’t judge addicts cause of their lifestyles, we are people as well that have a different way of looking at life but still try and maintain the way ordinary people live… we waited for about 10- 15 min and Andrew arrived, he was sweating as hell, and his right hand shook more than usual… “Hey guys, sorry I ran a little late I got confused with the place.” He took a seat across me and took the bottle of Vodka from Sancho’s hand. “Go ahead why don’t you? Just grab my bottle and drink away…” Sancho said sarcastically, as he rose from his seat slowly… “ I’m sorry bro, I just needed a drink…” he took a shot and gave back the bottle to Sanch. “I had a run in with some friends of mine and I couldn’t pay them back so I had to give them what I promised you guys, then I got lost; these streets all look the same dude…” Andrew said shaking his head, and started reaching for my bottle, I took it away from his reach, saying no through my eyes… “ Look at this” I said showing the joint I rolled… “It’s cool Andrew, I know we’re missing the free fucks you were supposed to bring, but as long as we are here we might as well enjoy the party; do you know that the percentage of hot horny girls in this party is 78%, just look at the crowd… for sure we’ll catch some, I know I will” I said as I passed the joint to Sancho… “Let’s just smoke this joint and mingle around…” Sancho told Andrew. Andrew looked relieved and tried to reach for my bottle once again. “Fuck dude! Here! The bottles yours, lazy ass fuck” I told Andrew and figured I’d get myself another bottle and bring someone along for the session. I rose from my seat and told the guys to wait for me…  I dropped by the bar once more, Cherry was there entertaining some of her guests and Horry snuck behind her and gave her a hug. I whistled for them. Cherry glanced at me and spoke in Horry’s ear, Horry looked at my direction, and I motioned for them to come to me… it was 12:30 and my mind wasn’t that straight anymore. They excused themselves from the guests and walked to my direction, each holding a bottle of beer. They took the two seats beside me that were unoccupied. Horry dropped down and sighed… “Bro this night is turning up all right, I got laid again, although I wish it was with you…” she turned in Cherry’s direction. Cherry just gave him the finger and asked me what’s up… “ So what’s up?” I leaned over and whispered in her ear… “Well Sancho and I got the stuff ready by the pool I wanted to know if you want a toke as well, you know since you just grew a year older…” Cherry flashed me her smile again, that meant a yes of course… she told Horry as well, Horry just smiled as if he was already satisfied with his night, and motioned us to go ahead… Cherry just gave Horry a sucker punch and pointed out to the direction of Melanie and her group… Horry got the message and split from the bar. I got another bottle of whisky from Edong and stood up with Cherry  Cherry and I then made our way back to the poolside where we saw Sancho and Andrew wrestling on the grassy side by the pool. “Hey no Fucking Kids allowed in my party!” Cherry called out to Sanch and Andrew… “Well excuse us Miss I just turned 19!” Andrew said… the idiot. I walked over there and gave him a punch on the shoulder. They broke their little melee and both fixed themselves up and sat down joint in hand… we lit that baby up… Sancho as usual got the first hit, then I then Andrew. It was Cherry’s first time to smoke dope so she kept asking us how it was like… “Just go for it already Girl nothing bad will happen to you. It’s just like a cigarette except this cigarette here has an attitude…” Sancho said, “Yeah a Fuckin attitude is right Bro!” Andrew blurted out as he and Sancho gave high fives to each other. “Just suck it hard and hold the smoke in and suck some more!” I told her, as I took a hit and passed the roach to Cherry, “Dude! Chris that didn’t come out right bro…” Sancho told me… I paused; then the guys and me just burst out laughing. While in our laugh trip Cherry took one good long hit… her face just crumpled up as she started coughing it out, she still tried to keep her composure, but couldn’t help it. She put on a face that read: Oh Fuck! I Smoked Too Much! We just laughed and she laughed with us…   It only took us a minute to finish that joint then we just settled by the pool, talking bout things we saw on TV… “ You know dudes it sucks to be a sea turtle” I told them as I opened up a conversation “…cause one night right, I was switching channels and I saw two male turtles on top of a female right…” I took a shot of my whisky “ anyways, #1, the turtle on top of the female, was trying to fuck her right? But then #2 came along and started eloping #1 while #1 was eloping the female…” I said re-enacting the scene with my hands, “and as the program progressed the three were being chased by other sea turtles who wanna get a piece of the action as well, the whole program was just these turtles trying to dislodge #1 to fuck the only female sea turtle in the sea…” I told the story laughing… “Shut the fuck up!” Sancho said as he threw his empty bottle at me… it hurt, but I didn’t mind and continued my story… Cherry stood up and said she’d hang out by the bar, me Sanch and Andrew just chilled and listened to the music… after awhile I dozed off… next thing I knew Andrew had already left the party…  Sancho and Horry met up and conversed about what life could be if drugs were legal. Andrew left no trail, everyone just said he left the party with a bottle of vodka and never came back. I left the party to go and buy cigarettes by the corner store; Cherry followed me to the gate acting paranoid telling me not to leave. I told Cherry to stay put in her room; she was tripping, she was asking me to make her a baby, and in return she would cast a spell on my drawings to make them come to life, she smoked too much, hopefully she’ll snap out of it in an hour or so. On my way to the store I noticed a black van drive by playing music of Fifty Cent. And it skidded after the first street and ran into a post. Neighbors came rushing out. But I didn’t give a shit I just wanted to buy my cigarettes. The time was around 1:00 am and I was lost… I didn’t know where I was going anymore. “Fuck I should’ve brought someone along with me.” I thought to myself. I’ve been lost now for 10 min. I’ve been going round and round and these streets all started to look alike. I decided to go back to the house hoping I could find my way there. Then Sanch called my phone up… “Where you bro?” he said it with a hint of worry blended with sarcasm… “Bro you won’t believe this but I’m lost bro, it’s fucking surreal… bro could you drive around and look for me?” I asked hoping he took it seriously… “That’s what I am doing right now just sit tight I’ll find you alright?” with that he put the phone down on me and I checked my pockets for some stray cigarettes that I might still have and sat by the curb…  So I was there, sitting on the curb next to the Bluebird street sign, waiting for Sancho… I noticed the sky filled with lights, and heard the engines of drag racers from afar; the air was cool and it gently brushed through me once in awhile. I was imagining if I could live life like this, no problems just listening to the world and never getting involved in it’s problems, no one to bug you, no one to tell you what to do, living without conflict, living life just plain, just simple, just peaceful, with a buzz in your head and a joint in your hand… I was out there, just imagining… it took fifteen minutes for Sancho to find me, from afar I could already hear his music drawing closer, Sancho always loved Telepopmusiks’ Breathe, he played it whenever he had a chance to… his blood red gallant stopped in front of me and he opted me to jump in… “Bro kill your sounds and sit with me for awhile…” I asked Sanch in my laidback voice… “I just had a vision, a feeling to share with you…” Sancho lowered the volume, and stepped out. He took a long look at me and gave me a whack on the head… “You Idiot! Don’t be tripping out just yet bro… it’s still early.” He reached out his left hand and gave me a boost up. I groggily walked to the passenger seat telling Sancho I needed a follow up. Sancho laughed and got in, turned the music up and we drove off back to Cherry’s place.  “Bro, don’t crash on me now…” Sancho shook me up… I fell asleep again… I was just waiting to get back to Cherry’s house so that I could get a drink, and hopefully get lucky in having a fine fuck for the evening. I could already see the gate; it was only a couple of meters away… I shook myself up; it was around 1:55 in the morning. We stopped for a minute, to smoke ourselves a roach. We stepped out and walked to the entrance. Damn, the tall majestic mahogany gate looked like the gates of heaven… or hell… I couldn’t decide on what should be what no more. The car park inside was still pretty packed but the sounds have moved from trance to hip-hop, it wouldn’t be the same trip for me from the trip I was having earlier that night. We moved in straight to the bar, Cherry was there, I was glad to see she snapped out of it earlier than what I had expected. She welcomed us back with a smile and pointed to the poolside, where Horry was, half naked and red as hell… Sancho and I just laughed… then Sancho made his way to the poolside, opting me to go with him, I told him I’d rather chill by the bar… Edong wasn’t there anymore instead; a guy at around my age was there, mixing some Bloody Marys and Kamikazes. I ask him to pass me a bottle of whisky, which he did without question. “Hey bartender, what happened to Edong Bro?” I asked him… “Oh Edong, he left awhile ago sir, it’s my shift now… by the way my name’s Rudy” the bartender replied… “Ok, then… Rudy” I could tell this bartender was a fag, the way that faggot spoke, and how that faggot gave me his name with a faggot-like smile… I despise faggots; all kinds…  I sat beside Cherry, hoping she got her head straightened out… “So Chris, I heard you got lost,” she said giggling a bit… “Yeah I did. I was going to the corner store, you know just to buy cigs, but I just found myself lost.” “You stoner! I don’t think there is a corner store around here,” she giggled… “Hey at least I wasn’t trading a fuck for magical drawing spells!” I replied laughing a bit. She stopped for a second and asked… “I did? Did I say such a thing?” She just laughed some more, till her strap broke off… “Shit! My strap broke…” she said trying to hold her blouse together. “Chris could you take me to my room so that I could change?” she looked at me with those eyes again… I thought, “Damn, take her upstairs to change, or to fuck? I can’t think straight anymore”, I snapped out of it and said yes trying to just keep in mind clean thoughts…  I was walking past all the drunken people lying on the floor following Cherry up to her room. Her house was a mess after only a few hours, damn what would you expect to happen in a house party anyways right? I stopped by her bedroom door, and told her I’d rather wait outside for her, “Suit yourself, I’ll just leave the door unlocked is that ok with you?” she said flashing me with a look in her eyes… she then gracefully entered her room; and as promised left it unlocked… “I’m not falling for that shit,” I told myself, knowing that I think I know what she had in mind, or was it my mind? After only a few short seconds I just said fuck it and entered her room locking the door behind me… she was on the bed as I had imagined, waiting for me to enter… “Shit you’ve planned this whole thing haven’t you? Eh Cherry?” I said to her as I paced the room… “So Chris, you’ve known about this and still fell for it…” she smiled at me “Why?” Fuck! What was I going to say? I was already thinking of words, till I just said… “You made me horny the whole time at the party, and I already knew you had a thing for me when we first chatted by the bar…” I said, slowing down my pacing… “And I just followed the path laid before me so I could get the truth.” I said as I walked up to her on the bed… “So do you want to know the truth?” she said to me flashing that smile and that glint in her eye again… I was ready…  We just fucked each other’s brains out; it was all just a blur to me… Cherry was lying beside me, she had passed out… I took my jeans, put them on, gave Cherry a soft kiss on the forehead and went down back to the party, or what was left of it… I didn’t bother checking the time anymore… I staggered down the stairs and passed the bar to get myself a drink… I sat down; only a few people now were to be seen, mostly consisting of Cherry’s good friends and a couple of outsiders trying to hook themselves up for the night… Rudy the faggot bartender popped his faggot head from out of nowhere, and ask me for my drink… I just told the faggot to pass me a bottle of whisky… “Good night sir?” Rudy the faggot bartender asked me, trying to open up a conversation… “Look here just give me my bottle, I’m not in the mood to talk to anyone all right…” I told him sternly. He gave me my bottle and I went around the house to look for Sancho. My first stop in the house was the buffet table at the dining hall; I wanted to chow for a while… there were some wanton noodles, barbecue, and cold beefsteaks, I grabbed myself a plate and took a sample of each. I didn’t mind if the food was cold, I just wanted to fill my stomach up… I sat down in one of the chairs by the dining table and commenced my eating… “Fuck… this night was a good night…” I told myself as I took shots from my bottle. I finished eating and left my plate then and there on the table. Holding my bottle I headed for the first place Sancho would be, the poolside… as I walked to the poolside, I felt my ankle start to ache and my head throb it’s hardest, “FUCK!” I shouted as I threw the bottle of whisky on the ground. I fell down on my knees clutching my head and trying to shake this pain off…  Sancho caught me puking my guts off… it was the first time this had happened to me, and what made me freak out that it wasn’t just stomach juice but blood… “Fuck! Chris!” I heard Sancho as he was running to help me… “Bro, I guess you messed yourself up this night eh…” Sancho said as he gave me a boost up and guided me to the bench… I couldn’t believe what happened, but I asked Sancho to get me another bottle of whisky at the bar, Sancho ran to get me what I ordered… I just laid back and lit myself a cigarette while I waited, my buzz disappeared and I needed a follow up, even if it killed me…  My head was throbbing with pain and my body started numbing up. I could only wait for Sancho to bring me my bottle as I waited at the bench. “Damn I overdid myself this night,” I told myself as I rocked back and forth in the wait… Sancho arrived with my bottle; he brought Horry along with him… “Bro I can’t believe what Sancho told me…” Horry said laughing, I took the bottle from Sancho’s hand and drank… “And I can’t believe my eyes! You still continue after puking blood!” Sancho added as he and Horry stepped back… “Fuck bro, like I told you guys before nothing and I mean nothing can stop my self-destruction…” I told them as I took another shot… “It’s something that you guys will never understand… this disease I have, this fucking Addiction it can never stop… so just leave me be for awhile, I need to stabilize myself ok?” I told them and they went off.   I lumbered off back in the house into the living room. I dropped into one of the beanbags and lit a cigarette… “If I’m to die tonight, at least I died doing what I loved most…” I told myself aloud… my mind was a blur with images of my past and I just enjoyed it… after a few minutes, I had already finished the bottle of whisky… I stood up and headed to the DJ’s booth and told him to split… “Your services are no longer required dude, you can go home, or hang if you want ok?” I told him as I gave him a slap on his shoulder, no one was here anymore to listen or dance anyway, just the few friends of Cherry… “Dude thanks man, I’ll be by the bar, go ahead play whatever you want…” The DJ told me as he left his CD case with me and headed to the bar… I flagged through his case and took out the Sublime Greatest hits CD and played Badfish, my song to end the night… it was already 3:30 in the morning… I roamed around Cherry’s house with Badfish playing. It occurred to me that Bradley Nowell and I had a lot in common, except of course he died years ago from an overdose and I’m still walking… Our lives were pretty much the same, and I thought I would probably end up the same state he’s in if I continued this a couple more years… “Cool” I told myself as I fell to the floor and drifted off to sleep thinking I wouldn’t wake up anymore…  “Wake up Chris!” it was Cherry, she was slapping my face but I couldn’t feel it, in fact I couldn’t hear anything that well… I didn’t even know where the fuck I was already… I just stood up and I could see the sun start to shine over the buildings, there wasn’t any sign of Horry, Sancho, or anybody… it was just Cherry and I, but where? Well she was in front of me, moving her lips I couldn’t make out the words she was trying to say, what am I trying to say, I couldn’t even hear them… my head was jarred with images and flashbacks, my head felt like it was being worked on with a jackhammer… ouch… I could already feel my legs but as soon as I did, I fell hard on the floor… my legs were twitching and my ears started to ring… Cherry helped me up and brought me to the kitchen, she had a hard time cause I kept on tripping over some junk lying on the floor…   We finally got to the kitchen and she guided me to a chair… “Fuck! My head feels like it just wants to explode!” I told Cherry as she walked to the fridge and took a pitcher of water and handed it to me… her lips formed the words ‘drink up’ I still couldn’t hear shit… I took the pitcher and drank. Fuck it wasn’t water… It was Gin! “What are you trying to do girl?” I said in my shocked state of mind fully awake and pumping with adrenaline… “At least you’re awake now…” Cherry said giggling a bit… yeah it was a good trick… “Now hand me a pitcher of water… For real this time…” I said as I tried to stand up… “Sancho and Horry left after you crashed…” Cherry said as she went back to the fridge… “They asked me to tell you to call them up when you woke up…” she came back with a pitcher, with water perhaps, and an empty glass… “Alright… What time is tit?” I said as I groggily reached for the pitcher and glass… “Tit? Did you just ask me ‘what time is tit?” Cherry said laughing… “Well, Chris the time I know is 7:00 am. In tit time I’m not so sure…” she replied laughing a bit more… “Hey! Don’t trip on a guy who just woke up fucked as hell alright?” I said laughing a bit… Cherry just smiled again and excused herself from the kitchen… I finished the pitcher of water and went out to the poolside… I guess Cherry and I weren’t alone after all, Sancho left his pouch of goodies; it was floating on top of the pool. I jumped in to get it…  1 The phone rang for about a minute then finally, Sancho answered. “ Aiyyo! Who this?” I could tell he was fucked up as well but I knew this guys in the condition to drive. “ This Chris, look dude I need you to pick me up bro, Horry the fuck just ditched my ass for some hoes dude.” I could already hear Sancho moving around over the line. “ Alright, where you? I’ll be there in five minutes alright, let me just cleanup this shit…” Sancho started slurring over… “ Hey Bro, you got buds man?” I asked him as I found a spot to sit in… “ Yeah man, shit I’m slurring again. Look just tell me where you are I’ma be there.” I gave him the location and put down the phone… it was already 6:30 p.m. and I was ready to crash. I got my busted ass notebook out and scanned through it, once again I started reminiscing bout what happened.   My train of thought was shattered, as a bus came to a screeching halt right in front of me, the bus was a fuckin rusty big pile of metal with wheels and it just stayed put for about five seconds. Then the doors slid open when a conductor popped his head asking where I was headed… I told the conductor to buzz off, he continued asking the other people that were on the bend as well, waving his wad of stinking bus tickets in his hand. A couple passengers stepped out. One of which I noticed… it was Bart. I called to him but he didn’t pay attention, so I stood up from my place and gave him a slap on his back. He must’ve been wired with speed cause he reacted faster than a fucking rabbit could and whipped out a knife… “ Whoa! You Fucker it’s just me bro!” I replied with a bit of strain in my voice. He took a look at me and said. “ Bro Fuck sorry man, I thought you were a cop or a snatcher or someone…” he replied as he put aside his knife in his jacket pocket. “ …By the way what are you doing here?” I explained to him the situation. In turn I asked him “ So what are you doin’ here as well?” he shifted the placing of his feet a couple of times and said “ HUH?” fuck he’s messed up, but I asked the same question again. “ Oh me I’m here cause my place is just down this road, want to chill there and wait for Sancho there?” I shook my head declining his invitation, reminding him what happened the last time I was in his place. “ Dude, remember three weeks ago? We chilled in your place, me, Sanch, Horry and Andrew, and then while we were stoned we got raided and you split like a frickin jackrabbit, we spent how many nights in jail till Sancho’s brads pulled some strings…” He just shook his head and snickered apologizing for what happened. “ Bart, you wired man?” he shook his head shuddered his shoulders and just continued snickering… at that point I was getting annoyed till he asked me bout my party last night.    Sancho finally arrived there in his blood red Toyota gallant, sounds booming from his speakers. As he stepped out, smoke billowed out. Damn the moving hot box is in action once again. “ Aiyyo! Chris, what’s Barty boy doin here with you?” Sancho asked in a disgruntled way. “ He got off the bus I forgot he just lived down the street, I could’ve told you to meet me there, but you remember last time…” I told Sanch, laughing a bit. “You are right man, next time, Bart Yo! Don’t split like a frickin tadpole when the cops come man.” Sancho said laughing his stoned ass off. I walked over to the passenger door bid farewell to Bart and took my notebook and jotted down a short and meaningless poem, Sanch followed a few seconds later closed the door and put the volume down. “ Bro put some ganja music in, and tell me where you want to go.” I reached for the CD case in the back seat; I always left my music in Sancho’s car for some strange reason… I took out my reggae CD that contained Bob Marley And Yellowman stuck it in and turned up the volume. “ Sanch, bro, I can’t go home in this condition, Rachel’s gonna give me another sermon again…” I said shaking my head. “ Let’s just chill around in your place… let’s just pass by 7-eleven and buy some beers.” We drove off and Sancho loaded the pipe… I took a toke and passed it back to Sanch. Sancho always had the good shit from Amsterdam. I had a good buzz and asked Sancho to wake me up once we reached 7-eleven. I drifted off to sleep…  Chapter 2: The stop at 7-eleven  We were almost at 7-eleven when Sancho woke me up… “Hey Bro… Bro! Wake the fuck up we’re near 7-eleven already…” he shook me up I was nudging him off till finally his continuous shaking woke me up. “ FUCKIN A! Bro I was sleepin’ man…” He raised his right hand and gave me a light whack on the head, reminding me that I asked him to wake me up… “ Oh yeah I forgot…” I said laughing still hit from the toke I had. We stepped down the car, after hiding the shit we smoked up in the car… I was reminded that I didn’t have any cash so I asked Sanch if I could bum from him. “ Bro check your CD case… I think you left a couple of bills their…” he takes his car keys and tosses them to me. “Meet me inside alright…” he said as he walked to the store. I walked back to the car and opened the trunk, revealing 10 of my CD cases. “Which CD case did he mean?” as I surfed through one of the CD cases, a picture fell; it showed me and Sancho back when we were still in grade 1. Bunch of innocent looking kids, it’s hard to imagine that we’d end up where we are right now… I slipped the picture back and found my money on the fifth case. I locked the car and went to the store. Sancho was by the fridge checking out the beers I tossed him back his car keys, and scavenged around for the munchies. I passed through the fields of plastic wrapped preservative filled dried grain products, and settled on 5 packs of Doritos, and I then walked to the counter and paid for the chips and bought two packs of Marlboros. Sancho followed with a twelve pack of san mig lights. We stepped outside with our supplies and headed for the car… we sat down and drove off. I rolled down my window feeling the air blow through my face, I reached for the pack of cigarettes and lit myself one. I then took my share of the beer and had a huge gulp…  Minutes after we left 7-eleven the radio announced that the 7-eleven we were in just got robbed and the clerk was shot 5 times and many were wounded, me and Sancho just sighed and thanked god for our lucky stars… half way through my first can we had already reached Sancho’s village in White Plains… we caught up with Andrew by the gate… he was staggering with a deep gash on his left cheek. We asked him to hop in. Andrew, the fuck, always got himself fucked in situations, we told him to chill at Sanch’s place so we could take care of the wound… apparently he had a run in with some major underground group last night… that made things clearer for me.  Chapter 3: Andrew’s Issue  Andrew was lying on the couch feeling the gash on his cheek; Sancho was in the bathroom lighting up a joint… he was also trying to contact Horry. In situations like these Horry was good help… I was pacing around the room thinking whether I should go home or stay with the guys; I was still wearing the same clothes from last night and I didn’t have a bite to eat; and I meant real food. The time was already 9:00. We cleaned Andrews wound up, we dropped some hydrogen peroxide on his face and Sancho sewn his face up and patched it with a square band-aid… Apparently after Andrew left the party he had a run in with some major fraternity he had a beef with two months ago…   “I was drunk as a mother fucker last night I was walking towards my car and next thing I knew a couple of big tough punks from APO pulled a 45’ on me telling me to hop in the van…” Andrew walked towards Sancho’s fridge and got himself a can of beer and helped himself to a bag of Doritos… “Fuck bro if I only knew I was gonna bump into them I could’ve brought my shot gun along…” he finished his beer in 4 huge gulps and grabbed another one… “The funny thing about it was after a few minutes I was in the van, getting my ass whooped and threatened, the driver crashed into a post trying to avoid an idiot standing in the middle of the road.” I stood from the bed and grabbed myself a beer as well… “Well I guess you should thank me bro…” I said laughing a bit… Andrew replied asking why… “I was there. I thought some kids were just drunk when they crashed their ride they were driving hella fast, so I didn’t pay attention cause I was pretty stoned…” Andrew just stared at me and laughed… “I guess I should thank you for the state I’m in as well eh bro?” I just chuckled; Andrew was trying to be serious… “Look, bro the driver died instantly in the crash, the others were knocked out and I busted my knee and got fuckin cut in the face…” “Hey it’s better than lying face down on a pool of blood or your body riddled with bullets; oh wait the meant the same thing didn’t it?” I told Andrew chuckling on the last bit of my sentence… Andrew explained to me that he owed these guys some cash and that he has up to next week to pay them twenty grand… at this point Horry arrived.  Upon entering the room Horry once again apologized for ditching me at the bus station, he looked tired as mofo. I accepted his apology and told him about Andrew’s situation… he looked at Andrew as he lit a cigarette… “So tell me, what did you do to owe these guys so much?” Horry asked Andrew in a serious tone of voice… “Well I… Well I rammed my V-tec in one of the OG’s Expedition, I promised I was to pay them back, but that was two months ago… and… I was ashamed to ask cash from you guys…” Andrew said shifting his position on the chair. “So you let it escalate to the point that they had to kidnap you… just because you didn’t pay for the car’s bill of repair? That’s bullshit! You’re hiding something from us… aren’t you?” Sancho stepped in from the bathroom; apparently he heard everything from inside… “ Cause hey, I wouldn’t go to such an extent to kidnap a guy and threaten him just to pay for a repair bill that was… 2 months ago you say?” Sancho paced to his fridge got a bottle of vodka and took a shot… “Sure I’d remind the guy a couple of times to pay me back, but what kind of guy would do this shit to you if you didn’t do anything else to him? Tell me bro… tell us what else you did.” Sancho said passing the bottle to Andrew… I just sat there reached for Sancho’s pouch, rolled myself a joint and hit the bathroom; I wasn’t in the mood to hear anymore problems…  I got out after I finished the joint; Andrew had his hands on his face shaking left and right, spilling tears on his bright red shirt. Sanch and Horry got the truth from him; I didn’t bother asking anymore what happened I was just ready to do what I can do… “Chris, grab the 12 gauge under the sink in the kitchen, you know what to do…” Sancho told me… “Andrew you stay here…” Andrew just nodded, then Sancho gave Horry and me a look only we knew… we hit the road in Sancho’s muscle car, a modified Land Cruiser, he had it repainted black and had the windows bulletproofed, as usual had his speaker set up, and believe it or not, he added a NOS system that was under the passenger seat. We reached the gate of White Plains, our windows rolled down, a cig in each hand… “Chris, bro I know we’ve done this before, but as usual I need to remind you, cause you’re stoned… Again…” Horry told me… “We’ll just talk to the guy alright, scare the guy as usual maybe ask a favor from him, you know give Andrew some time. You stay outside and if things go wrong, pop some shells got it?” I nodded, trying to focus myself. We were already driving on Edsa by Crossings; I was enjoying my cig and the lights of buildings and cars passing by. By the time we reached Ayala I was still hit hard, I thought I could get a drink once we reach WhereElse! I sat lower in my seat just thinking to myself…  “Fuck I’m doing this shit again…”  We looked for the best parking spot in the parking lot in front of the club; we found the perfect spot after a minute. I had a great view of the entrance, no obstructions I could get a clear hit if anyone who came rushing out the door. Sancho, Horry and I wished each other the best of luck, so that I wouldn’t have to pull the trigger. They stepped out, reminding me again of what I was to do, and walked into the club. The clock on Sancho’s dashboard flashed 11:00, they’d be out in 10 minutes or less if everything went well. I went down and had a cigarette…   Chapter 4: Waiting for Ten Minutes  I finished my cigarette. My head was buzzing with images of what was going inside the club… Sancho would introduce himself and Horry, then Sanch would say his usual statement to startle whomever the guy was, he would start the conversation firmly, then Horry would mediate the situation if things ever got out of hand. He then would rephrase Sancho’s words in a more understandable, but meaningful statement. Probably at this point, the guy would have two things in mind, he would either give consideration, or fuck these two guys and do whatever the fuck he wanted to do. If ever the second thought came into mind, I would step in do my part… hopefully he would give Andrew the chance, I didn’t have the time to get my shit ruined again, and after all I’ve gone through… I remember the first few times we did this, give a talk to a trouble maker, we were all young back then and our conversations usually ended with the other guy’s head blown off; of course I did all the dirty work… I was never really good with words, I’m more of the action type of guy… although lately our meetings all went smoothly, I didn’t have to blow anymore brains, and we also always kept our end of the bargain, so both ends had good deals… hopefully we’ll get lucky again… as I lit another cig, my phone rang. “Chris, Where are you? Again!” it was Rachel, damn this bitch… I never get a single day free of this bitch’s complaints.  “Baby, I know I was supposed to be home this day, but something came up…” I said still trying to keep my emotions intact. “What is with you? You’ve been hanging around Sanch, and Horry all the time; you and those fuckin assholes called friends…” she said, fuck I couldn’t believe that she was dragging my friends into this shit between us… “Look here bitch! My friends have nothing to do with us all right?” I shouted over the phone trying to make a point. “Look don’t be breathing down my neck all the time alright! You wouldn’t, I repeat you wouldn’t understand the shit I’ve been doing even if I wrote it in black or white…” I said… I couldn’t keep myself in check anymore… “ The best thing for you to do is get the fuck out of my apartment and erase my number from your phone.” I lit myself another cigarette, as I waited for her response… “Chris… I’m sorry…” she was sobbing on the other end… my heart sank again and I refreshed my thoughts and feelings… “Look don’t cry alright, I’m sorry I shouted ok, you just caught me in a bad time…” I took a puff from my cig and threw it… “Yeah, I know I haven’t seen you lately but try and understand that I’ve just went through a great ordeal, I needed some time alone, spend some time with the guys… cause shit they’re the only ones who could screw my head back together again alright?” I got in the Land Cruiser and checked the time; five minutes have passed… “Look I promise you, I’ll be home tomorrow ok?” I said reassuringly in a lower tone. “Ok…” she replied her sobbing started to fade, and put the phone down on me… Damn it!  I got back into the car and checked the time another two minutes have passed, that made a total of seven, shit I hope things were going well inside, I rolled down the window and had a smoke… fuck, this day was fucking stressful…   Horry called my phone saying it went well, the OG would give Andrew another two months to pay him back for the bill, all he wanted was Andrew to apologize for drugging the OG’s sisters and screwing his ex-girlfriend a year ago. Fuck I was glad I was smoking up in the bathroom when Andrew told Horry and Sancho this; cause if I’d known I would’ve just beat him up then and there whether or not he was a good friend of mine… they said that the OG wanted to meet me, I told them I was in the parking lot and I didn’t want to move so they told me to wait… “One thing Chris this guy is alone, we’ll be coming out with no one else, once you see him fuck bro try to keep yourself composed alright…” Horry said to me over the line, I promised him and turned my phone off… “Keep myself composed? For what? ” After a minute they were out with the OG, Rico… they walked over to me, I was at the side leaning on the Land Cruiser, then Rico stepped up in front of me laughing, “So this was the guy who was to bust a cap in my ass…” Rico said looking up to me… god I can’t believe a guy like this was an OG of a major frat… this guy was around five foot four inches tall wearing “totoy” hip-hop clothes, I just smiled at the punk tough guy wannabe. “Yup, I’m the guy…” I told him battling my thoughts about this fucking shrimp being an OG… “It’s a good thing you took our terms bro. I’d hate to see another guy fall down cause of what I might do, you know?” I told him I noticed him shiver a bit “Rico, right? Rico’s your name? All right nice meeting you… hope when we see each other again it wasn’t a product of conflict alright?” I motioned Sancho to talk to me. I excused myself from Rico and whispered to Horry to take him back and get me a drink from the club’s bar…   I waited for them to step back in the club… as they disappeared me and Sancho just burst out laughing… “A fucking totoy like that is a fucking OG?” I said as I struggled to open the door of Sancho’s ride… Sancho just laughed and stepped in as well busting out a cigarette. “Fuck the dude looked like he was still wearing diapers man… ‘So this is the guy who was to bust a cap in my ass’ that tough guy wannabe man!” I told Sancho as I lit myself a cigarette… seconds later Horry came out with my beer, hopped in the back seat and we left WhereElse! Horry just started laughing at the situation… “I can’t believe we were going to shoot down a fucking Kid, I swear to god this kid looked like grade 6” Horry said… I drank from my beer… Sancho just told Horry to forget about what happened with the totoy and think about what to do with Andrew… I drank and just laid back…  Chapter 5: The Idiot  Me, Sancho and Horry were driving off, back to White Plains, where we had hoped, Andrew was waiting. Passing Edsa once again, only a few cars were on the road accompanied by a bunch of semis… “Bro what should we do about Andrew man?” I asked Sancho and Horry… “I mean, why the fuck did he have to do those things to a fucking shrimp dude… I mean sure the OG was a fucking shrimp, I could tell he was on the verge on crapping his pants when he came up to me… Rico… what a fucking stupid ass name… And Andrew is an idiot for picking on one…” I said venting out some humor and anger at the same time… Sancho and Horry just laughed, “Hey guys, wanna pass by 7-eleven grab a couple of drinks before we see Andrew again?” Horry suggested… “Sure, why not?” Sancho said as he stepped on the gas and made a turn… we knew every 7-eleven in this fucking city, every road to take, every nook and cranny just to get to a 7-eleven… we finally reached one along Shaw Boulevard… They both stepped out. I was starting to doze off…   “Chris, get your ass up!” Horry said as he opened my door… “Alright, alright… I’m up and walking…” I said as I got down from the car and walked around to prove myself… “Satisfied?” Sancho just shook his head and we walked into the store… as usual, Sancho was by the fridge again and I handled the smokes and chow… Horry was by the magazine rack reading a PSM magazine that featured Metal Gear Solid 3 on the front… “Hideo finally came to his senses guys…” Horry said as he browsed through the magazine “I can’t believe it’ll be out soon…” Horry dribbled on as we were doing our usual stuff. Horry was the eldest and the youngest in our group. He’ll be serious in fights and business, but when he turns his back he kind of becomes a 12-year-old kid… we finished our routine and headed for White Plains… Sancho whipped his phone out from his pocket and called his house up hoping Andrew would pick it up… No one was answering… we figured Andrew crashed after we left… Sancho stepped on the gas anyway just to be sure…  We arrived at Sancho’s place, it was around 3:30 AM… we lit ourselves a roach in Sancho’s garage and preceded upstairs with our supplies… on the way upstairs we had noticed bottles of beer and vodka on the floor, Andrew must have drank to forget his worries for awhile… as we got to Sancho’s room we found Andrew on the floor face forward, we had dropped everything we had in our hands and rushed to check Andrew’s condition… “Bro!” we shouted in Andrew’s ear hoping he was just asleep, Sancho took Andrew in his arms and laid him on the sofa… we checked his pulse… nothing. “Fuck!” Horry shouted as we continued to see if there was any chance we could revive Andrew… nothing… we were too late…   The idiot OD’d on Sancho’s stash of Ecstasy and Morphine. Sancho was pissed… We had a dead friend of ours lying on the sofa and he had to take Sancho’s stash along with him, wherever he was off to… he had broken the syringes that contained adrenaline shots to revive him, I guess he wanted to pass away then and there fearing that we would have a talk with him after we settled our business with the shrimp OG… “You Fucking Idiot!” Sancho said at the top of his lungs as he was clutching Andrew’s lifeless body in his arms… We were all just bummed out finding out one of our good friends have passed away… “What are we going to say to the parents guys?” Horry had said his voice was shaking along with his body. “Horry, his parents are dead… remember?” I reminded Horry… come to think of it, after Andrew’s parents have passed away, we were the ones who took care of him; we took care of each other… We were the only family Andrew had, if he ever did consider us as his family…   We just sat there, I didn’t bother what was going in their heads, I was busy with getting my head straightened out, I was feeling stoned and having feelings of grief at the same time for what had happened to Andrew… that is the worst combination for a guy to have going on in his head… “Horry, Chris,” Sancho said shaking his head… “Get a Garbage Bag and stuff him in there…” Sancho said as he started shedding tears… “This is the best we can do for him, pack him up and let’s head to Batangas, he always said he’d love to be buried by the beachside…” “Sancho… yeah he did say that.  Well let me get the bag…” I said as I walked out of the room. I had reached the kitchen and opened up the fridge and grabbed me a carton of milk, it was time I drank something else aside from alcohol…  Chapter 6: Outro  I had grabbed 4 XL sized garbage bags from the kitchen and headed upstairs to where I had left Sancho and Horry with Andrew… I still couldn’t believe one of us had fallen, and of all the people, it was the least we had expected; Andrew, the one whose health was pretty much intact, the dude who partied least, the dude who smoked out the least, the dude who basically stayed home frequently, even though he had the cash and the time to go out, he was a clean pimp… all the guys thought I would be the first to go; at the rate I was going I thought so as well… Then it would be Sancho and Horry, last would’ve been Andrew. It’s funny come to think of it, what if we had the order wrong?   “Fuck it Chris” Sancho had told me, as I stepped into the room “Let’s just drive off there now; bring some shovels along… And we’ll pack him then and there instead…” Sancho had said, “I got dibs on the front seat…” Horry blurted out trying to humor the situation… it didn’t work… we just sat there a few more minutes and Sancho checked the time… “It’s 4:15 guys… Let’s move…” Sancho spoke as we all had risen from our seats to carry Andrew downstairs… we laid Andrew on the backseat of Sancho’s gallant, then I went off to grab the shovels, located underneath the sink in the garage… “I can’t believe we are doing this!” I said to the guys as I popped the shovels in the trunk… “I just can’t believe this shit…” I dribbled on, continuing what I was supposed to say in my head… I walked over to the front seat till Sancho spoke… “Chris, you drive, I’ll spend the trip with Andrew over here…” Sancho tossed his keys to me and slid into the backseat with Andrew. Horry hopped in the front with me…   Sancho and Andrew were the closest to each other in our group; cause Sancho was mostly there to give advice and help him out of situations, he was Andrew’s big brother if you looked at it, so it hurt him the most to see his ‘little brother’ dead in his house, lying dead in the car now cause of his stash of narcotics… Sancho was blaming himself for leaving Andrew there with all the drugs he could take… we did regret leaving him there, we should’ve brought him along with us… well there aint no use grieving what has been done… I started the engine and we drove off…
