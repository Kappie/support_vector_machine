Staring at a blank screen , no one here to speak to. none of th eppl i kno are online, never really had a lottafriends in real life.    Staring out of my window watching clouds drift past slowly, i would give a limb and a portion of my soul just to have C with me her now. ( a portionof my soul, hell all of it , if need may be).Storm clouds gathering, adding to th depressive atmosphere that already prevails.    Watch little birds fly away watching them become smaller and smaller, the further away they go, until they eventually disappear.    Lisa is in manchester for the day (and night). wish that she'd never come back(lol)    I have the 99 red baloons song singing in my head. wonder what Eddie's is up to.He probablystill chilling in Mexico.    [As you can see i am bored as hell .. gonna pop andhave a look at rob's site . lol see how much he progressed in his work .. damn whichreminds me i still havent seriously started]
