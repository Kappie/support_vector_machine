This film vaguely reminded me of  Fight Club . I still would highly recommend this - i liked the character development - others didn't - maybe they are better critics - who knows.  Today i turned in my apron at "the Antler's" as much as i may have liked aspects of the job - it was too time consuming - my grades were starting to suffer - mainly because i wasn't getting any sleep - let alone time to work on schoolwork -  Aslo suffering was my God time - he kind of took a backseat over the past 4 weeks as i slowly, but surely squeezed Him out of my life.  God knows the predicament that I've put myself in now - concerning summer housing, bills, and camp in August - also, maybe God wants me in Anchor house - which would actually be pretty sweet, but i f i stay in the fraternity house - i just have to pray that I'm a light in a dark room and that i not be consumed by the darkness around me - thankfully i have a family and others at church who will help support me in whatever endeavors i take on.    peace and God bless  Travis
