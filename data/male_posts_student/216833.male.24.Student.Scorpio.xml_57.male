I should have never stopped, even for a week, it is detrimental.   Well, I'm tapped out. I disputed an officially posted charge today and they blocked my card. I can't spend a dime - I just think it would complicate things more. So as the days go on, planet services has morphed into other companies like ISUND fiber optics and ISUND Internet and the one that posted was B365 Stokes/Trent??? That is weird, even the lady at the bank thought that was odd. Damn fuckers!  Some times you just gotta push it to the very end of the line!
