It's all good =)   Creativity  Now, I'm generally searching for a topic in my head to babble to myself about. My main idea, is unfortunately  creativity , of which I have little. I'm right handed, and my brain usually lacks any creativity, until I'm on the border of falling asleep. Vivid crazy things then, of which little I can remember (These aren't dreams by the way, but it's a lucid state. One weird thought I had was a bunch of dwarf party crashers, one filling himself up with helium! Oh that was fun lol) The way which I usually come up with strange out of control ideas when I'm non-lucid *sigh* is mainly a form of trickery. Basically, you think one thing then lead onto others. So, you take the most normal thing, and go on from that, for example  Rock   A rock has moss growing on it, moss grows in forests, forests are wet, wet is clouds, clouds have birds. So from that strange thing, my head has assembled an idea of a stalky bird carrying a giant boulder on his back and with rollerskates (don't know where I got the rollerskates from, but =P )  That's basically how I get my "ideas" from. I have a few other weird tricks, mainly involving an archive of about 7,426 pictures, contained in 307 folders and taking up 721 megabytes... Thank god for today's hard drives! I might do one of the creativity exercises everytime I post just for practice. (Even though 0 people read this! wooT!) Another good  idea is to go to  urlLink Concept Art.org's Daily Sketch Group  which always have a strange variety of ideas and topics, and at the moment 439 days of logged ideas and thoughts =)   School  I go back to school tomorrow... *sigh* And I'm in a worse state than before. When I get back I have to catch up on an English Common Test (on POEMS! *eek*) and then on my Practical Music, and then accept the annoyance of my band conductors (I'm in 3 bands, Concert Band, Orchestra and Jazz Band) about missing so many rehearsals near a performance (we have Showcase night coming up). But in truth, I really do like band. Yes, I hate getting up at an insanely early time in the mornings, and the occasional insult from a few other members (at heart they're nice, so I leave it at that) it's all good. And music, even though I may not necassarily be great at it, does help to relieve tensions (as long as the music you're doing isn't due for a practical exam tomorrow lol)
