I've got this awards day thing later....I wonder what I'll get. I really don't wanna go, I'd rather got to this band concert to see this person, but I think I have to. Not much else going on. I heard my brother say "fuck" today. Upon hearing this, I ran and found him, threw him on the ground, lightly kicked his bottom, and told him if I ever hear him say it again I will kill him. It's that damned blink 182. I swear he is turning into a skater. Soon he will have nose rings and tattoos. Well, now I'll go back to waiting for that special person to get online.  By the way, start posting coments on my posts. Makes things more fun.
