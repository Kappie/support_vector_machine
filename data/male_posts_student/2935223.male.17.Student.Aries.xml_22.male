Hmmmm......today I went down to Ervin's to get my PS2 back, and I hung around there for a while...then he got a call from McDonalds....he had to work today....*and we were in the middle of 5th Element too*  So he got dressed really fast...and then I drove him to McD's and then I went to EconoFoods to get the root beer like my dad told me to..and I saw Naomi there...that was pretty kool.  *hehehe..her name backwards is Imoan......gehehehehehe*  So, I went and got the root beer and got to about the hospital when i realized, I left my PS2 at Ervin's....WOW...I'm stupid....so..I did a quick U-ey in the road and headed back for Ervin's. When i got there his mom had left the door unlocked, because she noticed that I left it there, and knew I would be coming back for it.  So when I did, she kinda laughed at me, and then told me to lock the door when I left, and I did.  I then left and drove back to my house, and played a little bit of DDR, I did the lessons, seeing if by doing them all I could get another song or sumthin', but it got really boring, so I quit.  Then I sat down and typed on the computer for while...waiting for people to come on...so I can talk to them....and when people did finally come on..I had to go eat dinner.....boy it was good.  Coloflower*can't spell*and cheese, with chicken.....yum...it was good....I can still taste the cheese and Coloflower*partially because it's probably still stuck in my braces*  Dang you braces....oh well.....I get them off soon...YAY!!  My next appointment is on the 4th of April or sumthin'....YAY!  I don't get them off then though.....poo.... I GO TO JAPAN IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!!  I hope you all miss me when I'm gone...or I'll be uber pissed..and if you want me to get yo anything...tell me....or....nuthing for you!  :-P hm...what else is there to talk about???? hm......I feel there is sumthing else I need to say...but I don't know what it is....... Well..I've been writing for basically a half hour now...and...I've kinda run out of stuff to say...even though I know there is sumthing I'm forgetting...what could it be.....I DON'T KNOW!!!  Well.....I figured out one thing after sitting here looking at the monitor for like 15 minutes....I STILL MISS TINA!!!  I don't kare how much people tell me to get over her...or how much I tell myself that I am over her.....I'm just lying to myself....I really miss her...even if she does hate me...or....if she's actually reading this......put "you" in for "her" and "she"...and change "does" to "do" Man I'm pathetic...why is it so hard to get over Tina?!?!?!?!  Sumone give me an answer or a hammer or sumthin'....PLEEZE!!!  Well...I don't know what the other thing was stil.....but..I'm gonna go back to my still empty life.....Peace  Spense  ***EDIT***  I had to edit it....because the time was horribly wrong...it's actually 8:30ish when I wrote this...not the time that it said before...which was like 5:30ish...stupid wrong timey thingy..  Either way...back on to the topic I was just talking about before I go to bed...I don't like being called awesome.....pleeze...no one call me awesome.....this period of time has caused me to understand that awesome can turn into utter hatred really fast...Why did it have to change so fast?  How do feelings flip back and forth that fast?!?!?  confusing.....I THINK SO!!!  I don't think that you can really hate sumone until you get to know them fully...and I don't think that I was given enough time to fully express myself...no I'm not trying to bash anyone....I'm just saying sumthin' that I feel...and if anyone takes this to heart and changes their outlook on sumone...THEN I WILL HUNT THE DOWN AND KILL THEM!!!! K?!?!?  good.  Peace Again  Spense
