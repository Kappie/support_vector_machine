       
      I started the week off with a bang and now nothing exciting is going on. I was exhausted today despite going to bed early last night. I think my body is so used to even black coffee that the stuff makes me more drowsy than awake. I was barely holding on at work this morning. It sucked.  In other interesting news. 3 days have passed since I cussed out a friend of mine and no guilt. That means I know I did the right thing. I mean, normally knowing that you did something to hurt someone you care about makes you feel bad; however, I don't. I'm a pretty patient, easy going guy that can take shit pretty well, but sometimes people take advantage of that fact. When that happens I feel that I have to make a stand, especially after many compromises in the past. Life goes on.  In rotation right now is the Cars, One Man Army, Bad Religion, and Bouncing Souls.  ***
