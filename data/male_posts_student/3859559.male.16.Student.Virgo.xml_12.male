You don't have to find love you only have to find someone you can get along with for the rest of your life. When I decide whether or not to make a move on a girl it's not if I think I'm in love with em'. I look for and in this order looks, personality, and compatability. That's all you need in a relationship. I cannot be with someone I don't find attractive it just dosen't work for me. If I'm with a girl she better be fit and good looking. I can't be witha girl that's stupid or dittsy that also dosen't work for me. I want a girl with brains someone who can talk about different things. I think that's why I'm always attracted to exchange students. It's because they've been through more than most people at their age that and we have something in common right off. I don't want a goody goody chick either. I want a girl that won't mind riskin gettin in to trouble whether it's havin a drink or two or liten up a cig, cigar or blunt. I just want a girl that's expierenced things most girls havn't. Also a reason to go for older girls. I gotta get along with the girl too. We gotta have a lot in common so there is always somethin to talk bout. My girl has gotta know when it's time to shut up and get down. I lovea girl that knows how to work it on the dance floor.   Remember: I want a lady on the street and a freak in the bed!!
