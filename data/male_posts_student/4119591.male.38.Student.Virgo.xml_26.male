According to this  urlLink WIRED  article, all of us are running around with loads of toxic chemicals in our bodies. Given the bad habits of my sordid past, I should probably be condemned and burned down lest I contaminate the water supply.   "Davis Baltz shops for organic food and otherwise tries to live as healthy as he can. So he was shocked to learn that the pollutants collecting inside his body sounded much like a Superfund cleanup site: pesticides, flame retardants and other nasty, man-made chemicals turned up in a recent test."  While the notion of having nasty stuff built up in our bodies is repugnant on the surface, no one is actually sure how much of the bad stuff is, well, "bad." Conspiracy theorists and professional environmentalists will likely have lots of fun with this one.  Meanwhile, I'm going to put all of that Homeland Security duct tape and plastic wrap to good use. The trick will be getting the new plastic and adhesive wardrobe to coordinate with my tin foil hats.
