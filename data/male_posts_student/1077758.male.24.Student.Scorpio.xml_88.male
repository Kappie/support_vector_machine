I'd like to be able to tell my younger self that some of the most anticipated things you wait for in life aren't all they're cracked up to be, at least not in the way you usually imagine them. I'd like to be able to tell my younger self that he has a bright, glowing future just down the road a piece. I'd like to be able to tell my younger self about the time I've spent wishing I'd like to be able to tell my younger self ANYTHING.
