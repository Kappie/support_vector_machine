Tomorrow im leaving at about 1:00 to head down there with someone that works for their school district (my uncle is incharge of all the transportation in that district) so that should be interesting, riding 6 and a half hours with someone i dont even know. I know. It does sound like a party!  Expect Audblog updates everyday up until Sunday the 13th, because that day i will be leaving to go to the scout camp. And during that whole week i wont have any access to phones so obviously the audblog wont be updated for about 1 week.   Then after that week is over, i come home for Saturday and Sunday but leave again on Monday. So expect audblog updates (long ones) on that Saturday and Sunday. Then ANOTHER week of scout camp starts so no blog updates again.  After those two weeks the daily updates will start streaming in from Audblog. So dont worry. I've got ya covered.
