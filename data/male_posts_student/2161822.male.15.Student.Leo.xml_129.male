Picked up Neil. Went back to play more basketball. Improved slightly. Looked across the street and saw a man shooting things. Sweated. Looked in the park. Saw hippie smoking a blunt. Laughed. Saw hippie practice his kung fu. Laughed harder. Saw hippie try to kick down trees, fence, benches. Laughed harder. Left. Slept. Woke up. Went to bowling. Realized I sucked at bowling too. 120 something, 110, 140. Came home. Played more basketball. Sat at computer. Wasted away staring at bright screen. My life in simple 1st grade level sentences. Hope you enjoyed. I know you didn't.  Listen to H.I.M., SOAD,  A7X. (The list gets longer everyday)
