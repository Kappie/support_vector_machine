And yes, I'm one of those annoying people who will say hello EVERY day (and maybe even more than once!).  What can I say?  I like to think it's just that I like being nice, like saying howdy and seeing how everyone's day went, but maybe it's a compulsive-obsessive thing.  Who knows?  Anyway...if anyone just gets sick and tired of me IMing them EVERY day, just mention it...I'll try to restrain myself to every other day ;)
