It's easily my favorite television show, and the only reality series that I really get into.  The premise: ten teams race around the world, Phineas Fogg style. There's none of this "voting people off" business; the only thing standing in their way is the usual hazards of travel. People who've traveled the world will recognize many of the problems they face and the places they visit; people who haven't, will want to. It's kinda like the Travel Channel on speed. Entirely awesome. Give the first episode a chance, at least, or you're really missing out.
