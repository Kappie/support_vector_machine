But nv mind, i dun mind gettin things like tat as i am doing something I am interested in. Glad that things turn out well and every shot was taken nicely. But there are some cork ups here and there coz of a last minute addition of a memeber who is slightly inexperienced. Neway, I guess also due to thefact tat we were working together for the 1st time.But it was okay, actually, i kinda appreciate the help Anthony(Koo)  me got. So well, actually God answered my prayers for a good operation of the whole process. Praise The Lord. Well, gtta go and hope the cd comes well quick enough for the viewing and purchasing for the CC pple. So yah gtta go if not cannt finish!!!
