I'm sure some hick will think he's the only person in the building and offer his brilliant commentary on every painstaking moment of the film. In hopes that perhaps, that very redneck somehow has access to the internet and is viewing this blog right now, I would just like to remind everyone that talking, taking phone calls, and otherwise annoying your fellow movie enthusiasts is considered a faux pau.  The last time I was at the show, a family of three with no shoes walked in half way through. They sent their child of four years old to ask for candy from others, and then proceeded to call friends to brag about skipping out on the movie they payed to see and watching this one for free. This thing isn't common in my area, and I was rather surprised. If you have ever done this, please, refrain from entering public in the future for any reason and form an equestrian society in the woods behind you house.
