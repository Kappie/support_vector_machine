I like to play and watch sports, except soccer, and I like to pretend that I am good at the guitar. I have more siblings than is healthy for a teenage boy and but I love them anyway. Did you know that white chocolate isn't really chocolate? The Red Sox lost yesterday to the Devil Rays. That is all I have to say. You may all get on with your sorry little lives now.(JK)                                                   *SJD
