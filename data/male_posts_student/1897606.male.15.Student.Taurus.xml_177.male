As the volume continues, chapters are found which are called  Foods With Speed or: Fast Food, Tasties from Taiwan,  and  Rations of Russia , for example. The poetry...it's all about food. It is  poetry , written about nothing but  food . "Hamburger?," "Steak Sizzle Party," "Hot Dogs in the Sky," "Suchi Sushi!" All, poems, about, food...the poetry is written about consumeables. The texture, the taste, the heat and the cold, the ecstasy, the state of mind, the aroma, the sights and sounds, the  food ! It's all about food. And it's all POETRY.   Just a thought.
