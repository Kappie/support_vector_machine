I don't want to transfer anything on that drive to the secondary drive... i feel as if something will happen to the data if i transfer it that way.      My main "problem" is all the anime on my computer.  So, to counter-act that problem, i am burning some of the anime that i have.  Today was Uchuu no Stellvia... that was like the main killer, that series is 4.6 GB.  Well, that was quite the process.  And anyone who knows me knows that i love to create anime CD "covers".  So i spent around 30 minutes doing just that.  But i don't have much black ink, so i haven't printed them yet.      I also burned Boys Be, Mizuiro, and Pia Carrot 2 DX yesterday, so i have to get working on cases for those!      Lates
