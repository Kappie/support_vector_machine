That means one week without them, before I get out of there. It's really crazy that the 3 of us are out of there at the same time. It's really sinking in that I only have 2 weeks left at a place where I honestly did enjoy working and had a lot of fun. I've had awesome co-workers... George, Samantha, Julia, Thelma, Amanda, and even Lisa (despite our falling out after she left the company). That in addition to the fact Derek and Kaho will be back in the Bay Area by next weeks end makes me realize how many people I'll miss when I leave for Binghamton. Man... I'm really going to start a new chapter in my life.  Tomorrow all I have planned is work in the morning and then I'm free after that. Sunday I'm going to the movies and Monday I have work and dinner with the girls.  I've been downloading all sorts of stuff lately... lots of old school punk... Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Adolescents... and a lot of oldies... from Chuck Berry to the Marcels. The count of tagged MP3s is up to 2711.  ***
