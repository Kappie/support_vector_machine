I don't know whether it's Ulli's sleazy girl stories or your idiomatic discussions that caused it, but somehow the chinese ministers decided to cut off the entire chinese population from it. What a shame! Thanks Ulli for keeping me updated every now and then. All the free internet porn is available though...   Well, what to say? I'm bounded at a deserted village in the outskirts of a medium sized chinese city (4 mill.). Life is very relaxed. I'm teaching about 14 hours per week, and I just bought a bike that basically is my major joy right now. People are the most friendly I've ever met, and because I'm generally the only foreigner they have got to know as well they seem very excited to have this norwegian curiousity here. I arranged a football tournament last week. The response was overwhelming with more than 20 teams. More than 500 people came to watch the final. My norwegian football shirt was given away to the one voted "Most valuable player" of the tournament. I know it's a really american thing to do, but it was great fun...   To make this short I made a list with things I like and don't like about China:   Likes:  - Prices  - Pirate DVDs. After buying 4 seasons of the Sopranos and 3 seasons of the West Wing I've got home entertainment for the next month or so..  - Chinese, which must be the funniest language I've ever tried to learn.   Dislikes:  - "Guanxi", a chinese word you better learn if you're ever gonna get into business with the yellow fellows. Guanxi means "friends/connections" and is essencial for every thing you do. Hence, what you do is not as important as who you know. People here use to hang photos of their most important "Guanxi's" on the wall in their office so that everybody can see that if you mess with me, you are also messing with him.  - Red Tape and Bureaucracy. If there's something you want to change or do, wait for at least 10 peoples approval. Something that normally takes from 10-30 days. I've been here for almost three months, but the college still haven't managed to give me an employment contract.  - As the subject indicates, why the hell do they stick to the chopsticks after the discoveries of knife and fork. We're living in the 21st century for Christ sake,
