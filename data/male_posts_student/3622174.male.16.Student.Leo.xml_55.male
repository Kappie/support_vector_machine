But, before we get things going, here is how things are going to work from now on:      Monday- Videogames    Tuesday- Technology    Wednesday- MP3s    Thursday- Gadgets    Friday- Nothing    Saturday- Everything!      We won't have anything on Sunday, either.  So, get used to the new schedule, and hopefully I'll get used to it too.  Don't be surprised though, if something is out of line, because I'll occasionally mix things up.  So, since today is about videogames, I'll give my review of Top Spin for the Xbox.  So, here we go:   The Lowdown:  There have been some good tennis videogames, but none have lived up to Microsoft's new franchise, Top Spin.  That's right, Virtua Tennis fans, Top Spin is better than Virtua Tennis.  This is the best tennis game to ever be released, aside from maybe the original Pong game way back yonder in the 60's.  The cool thing about Top Spin is that customization can go anywhere.  You can create a player in the career mode, and customize it to how you want it, giving it the masteries in the skills you want, by training to make your serve better, etc.  The possibilities for creating characters are endless!   But, creating characters isn't the highlight of the game.  Graphics play a big part in the way that Top Spin dominates the tennis industry.  Even with the gameplay action zoomed out, this game looks incredible; better than any other entry in the 2003 XSN Sports Lineup, not to mention, of any tennis game of all time.  When you create a character, you can map distinguishing features onto your character, like how their skin looks, and your hair, and everything else, which is a cool addition, and during gameplay, you won't notice any kind of change from what you picked, because Top Spin is that cool.   Top Spin is compatible with Xbox Live and the new XSN (Xbox Sports Network) network; which allows you to play online, and check online for scores and rankings and stuff.  It's a really cool new feature, and Microsoft will go a long way with the new XSN system.  However, Microsoft is taking this year off from XSN to release bigger and better titles, like Halo 2, for example, so don't expect to see Top Spin 2005.  But, we'll hopefully see a new version next year.  Playing tennis couldn't be easier.  The game itself can be difficult, as your hands start to get tired during the middle of a tournament, forcing you to take a break, but, the control scheme of playing tennis is easy.  To serve, you just press A, let the meter go to wherever you want it to, and then press A again, and the ball will fly to the other side.  Or, you can risk by pressing L or R, and serving that way, but, that takes more practice in order to get it right.  Other than that, all you have to do is press A to hit the ball, and use the joystick to move around.   In a tournament, you have to win at least 2 out of 3 sets (you can change it to above 3 sets, I believe, but, no less than 3 sets per tournament round).  In each set, you have to win at least three breaks, depending on what your opponent has (there can be six breaks total in a set, but, that only happens if you and your opponent keep winning alternately).  Win two sets, and you're on your way to the next round of the tournament.  The bad thing about tournaments: you lose a match, you have to start the whole tournament over again; there's no save and restart where you lost, or anything like that.  If you lose the tournament, sorry, but, you'll be re-doing the whole thing.  But, other than that flaw, the tournament mode is awesome.  You can create your own custom tournaments in Top Spin.  I haven't tried this yet, but, if I can find some friends, I'll start some kind of tournament someday.  So, I'll let you know once I try this (and once I have friends, more importantly), and I'll let you know how this works.  The career mode is what really shines in this game.  You travel from country to country, competing in different tournaments, getting sponsors, learning new tricks, and doing all sorts of other things.  Hit start to go to the "Nexus," which allows you to see what is inside of your sports bag, and do all sorts of other things.  Easy to navigate, and not hard at all.   One major flaw that I've noticed with Top Spin is that I have gotten SO many disc errors since I bought the game.  I don't know if its my Xbox responding to the high quality of this game, or if its a disc problem itself that only I am having, but, I have gotten very many disc errors.  Don't be surprised if you get a few.   Even if you aren't a huge tennis fan, you're gonna love this one.  It is without doubt the best tennis game ever.  The control scheme is easy, the game is mildly difficult, the graphics look nice, and everything is good.  I definitely recommend this one to anyone, even if you're not a tennis fan.  It's fun, its easy to pick up, and an overall good game.  Give this one a shot .  Score:   Graphics:   95%-A   Gameplay:   92%-A   Sound:   90%-A   Replay Value:   100%-A   Final Score:  95%-A
