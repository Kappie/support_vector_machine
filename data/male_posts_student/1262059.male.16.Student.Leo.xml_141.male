A few things:  - The blue ad on the top is ugly... I may be able to cover it.  - The title on the top is ugly... I  will  change it.  - Having two people stand guard like that is ugly.  I will change it.  Possibly something Kakashi related?  Or back to X/1999 even?  - The buttons on the top are ugly... they too will change.  - The Archives are currently down...  Not due to the archives themselves, but due to that I have to design an archive page still.  - Grey is scary.  I know what you're thinking.  If everything is so ugly, why'd you change it?  I guess I was tired of the Blue Sai layout and just haaad to change it.  So welcome to ArV no Kifu v 4.01  -ArV
