So now Tim has the flu, I'm bored the hell out of my mind and I just realized I missed The Simpsons.   ETA: Then I watched Alias and was happy again. Then I was sad and depressed afterwards. Now I'm kind of happy because I had pancakes for breakfast! "Guess what Flappy! I'm not going to kill you yet!" And Tim isn't sick anymore! So we're going  downtown !   Erin - The whole Chicago, Chicago, Toronto thing isn't bothersome online. It's when Marten proceeds to...cackle it continuously that it grates on my nerves.  Marten - Please remove your crap from my house.  But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!
