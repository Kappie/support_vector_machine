Also,  urlLink Monday   is a big day for Nathan and Marten.  Enjoy Boston, you two!  [Would have been funnier if it were Jonah and I, if you remember that one youth group meeting. plus nate has a girlfriend, making him immune to gay jokes-Marten]  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
