That meant that footbal would be late (6:00 to 8:00 or whenever). After school I went to Justin's to pay some money that I owed him (I always owe him money). Then I picked up Jadie and we finally got around to watching  1 Hour Photo . As we were about 20 minutes into it Travis, who had just gotten his liscence, decided to drop by. So he decided to come over and eat one of my pizzas, drink one of my  urlLink Gatorades , and watch the movie with us. I didn't mind. Travis is cool!    Football   Football wasn't that bad. Bruce kinda got after me when I was pussy-footin' around a little, and he seemed quite mad. Then he made me do the drill again. And I got pissed and did it really good. And he said good. I felt really good. About an hour into our practice it started to lightning. So we moved the practice into the brand new multi-purpose room. It was quite easy. We couldn't really do a whole lot in there so we just ran plays and that sorta jazz. Practice got out nice and early 8:10. I then got outside to see that it was lightning like a butt-monkey! I came home and saw that my town was in a severe lightning storm warning of some sort, it said to stay away from electrical appliances. But I dont care I'm on the computer anyways. :D Somebody sue me!
