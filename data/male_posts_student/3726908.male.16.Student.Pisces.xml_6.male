She calls herself "a young firl with a lot of worries."  Results in school is average but she's good at drawing. Her greatest dream is to be a cartoonist. One day, she acquires some magical powers by chance. She can change herself by using magical powers into the fifteen years old her, a.k.a Fancy Lala, a superstar. In the other world with novelty and challenge, she disguises herself as another identity to do great performance on the stage.  However, be sure not to rely on magic too much!   Reviews:  You may be put off by the story, "Ack...you actually watch girly and kiddy anime!", but...Superb! I can't find any other better words ti describe this anime. This anime is not well known and most people won't be attracted by it. But lucky me for having the chance to get it and boy do i love it.  The plot focuses on Miho being 9 years old, turning into 15 and an artist when she's at it. Touching and an eye opener, it brillantly shows of the 'magic' in the world of stardom and the perils that come with it. Also, it depicts of how Miho juggles between her 9 years old student lifestyle and her 15 years old superstar lifestyle. Simply, it's how a girl copes with her dream. This kind of anime is rather new and rare in anime, therefore it brought a totally new experience to me. the ending, i might add is quite touching as well, almost bringing my tears to my eyes.   Graphics is nicely shown as well, nothing too complex or plain, just suits nicely with the theme of this anime. May i add that Lala looks quite cute to me as well. ^^  Being an anime dedicated to the road of stardom, there are many songs sung by the various characters and the overall melody is never too heavy. Seiyuus are well chosen with voices suiting their character and mood. One may find some of the songs featured a little too childish though...  All in all, this is a great anime for young girls and maybe some if the young males. Each character are introduced properly and one may even relate some of the events shown in the show. Action fans however, may be disappointed as this anime has totally no signs of any violence or action. This is a pure light hearted anime aimed for the adolescenes (there are exceptions). I may not be that young, but i definitely loved it.  Score: 5/5  Extra: Spanning 26 episodes, the local television once aired it, this is where i first saw it. The DVD boxset i bought has some cards and drawing of the anime as well.
