I can read music, i have a good ear for piano, but i can't seem to jam at all. It's bugging me on a metaphorical level.  It will come. I'll make it come.  Hehe, i'll make it come in  bit. In the meantime I'll be practicing Maple Leaf Rag.  Very cool song; right now i'm on the second page. Woohoo!  The first page needs some dynamics, and a bit more fluidity, but besides that it's totally done.  All I need on the fourth page is the notes, speed, rythym, and dynamics. So i'm pretty much all set there.  If I could get one a day....Wouldn't that be nice.  And if I could learn to jam in one key each week! Man, i'd be a serious prodigy. That's not what I am so dilligence comes into play.                My older brother was greatly privileged last night because he heard  Don Ryan  in concert with a jazz band. Plus played Linus and Lucy.  With the extremely crazy hard and cool jazz part.  Ack.  I'm next. If I could pick three people to see in concert, it wouldn't be some rock band or anything, it'd have to be people with major skill.  So Phil Keaggy, Don Ryan...and....either an edited version of Dave Matthews. (No, i do not listen to any of his songs that i've heard have language in it.)  Or maybe James Taylor.  I wouldn't want to hear Harry Connick junior, cause i saw him performing once on some tv channel; banging some chords out that didn't really sound good and acting like it was pretty much all about him.  Poser.  If you disagree, comment on my blog so i can delete it.  Time to go practice some more or listen to Maple Leaf Rag so I can practice it. Ciao
