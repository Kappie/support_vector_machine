Session 2  Assignment 1: Read chapter 2, do vocabulary sentences on page 40 and “Check Understanding” questions 1, 4, 7, and 8.  1.	Charter, a document issued by the government. 2.	Hacienda, a large estate owned by a Californian Spaniard 3.	Cash Crop, a plant grown by a farmer for the intent on selling 4.	Patroon, one who is given a large estate by the Dutch government 5.	Indentured Servant, a person with a contract set up that set up a system of work to repay a debt in order to gain freedom 6.	Mestizo, a person of Spanish and Native American descent 7.	Pilgrim, a traveler to a new land (often religious) 8.	Famine, the lack of food for prolonged periods  Check Understanding 1.	Spanish conquistadors were able to overpower the Aztecs with technology. Cannons, guns, and swords easily crushed the simple spears and arrows of the Aztecs. Not only that, but the Aztec ruler was dead, leaving the remaining Aztecs leaderless.   4.	Jamestown, although initially unappealing to reside in, proved to be a great settlement due to the improvements to the town. One man, named John Smith, was able to lead those not already killed in the harsh winter to improve Jamestown. After making alliances with nearby Native American’s, he pushed people with the quote “He that will not work, will not eat.” After Smith was forced to leave, Jamestown’s future looked grim, until the implementation of a cash crop, tobacco. The Native American’s taught those in Jamestown how to plant tobacco, and the settlers were able to expand Virginia greatly.  7.   Two important ways that the colonies differed were the time they were settled in and the reasons for settlement. The New England colonies were, on the whole, settled first. They were settled primarily for religious freedom, with one of the colonies focusing on a Puritan settlement. The Middle Colonies were settled around the same time as the New England Colonies. They, however, were settled more for trade reasons, with one of the colonies existing as a Quaker society. They Southern Colonies were discovered mostly after the other two areas, and were settled for trade reasons, land reasons, as well as for a Roman Catholic settlement.  9.	William Penn most likely set up a colony with religious freedom because of his own religion. He was a Quaker, and Quakers believe in kindness to others, equality, and religious freedom. He probably wanted to set a colony up in America because anywhere in Europe he might be subject to persecution. Also, he seemed to want to prove that all religions could live together in harmony.  Assignment 2: Write a “Personal Compact.” 	 	My parents are the leaders of my house. I shall respect all of their rules, as well as the spirit of those rules. They have provided me with everything I need, thus I owe it to them to give them my utmost respect. There are also many others with a higher “status” then me, and those that deserve the respect I have shall get it, and I shall abide by their rules, as well as the spirit of their rules. However, it is within my rights as a human being to pursue happiness, liberty, and life. There is a certain finesse in creating boundaries for oneself, but it is within the maturity of a 17 year old to make a valid attempt at this. Structure is certainly necessary, and it is within these higher organizations that a foundation for the limits of my life shall be laid. However, I shall remain in a state that I am able to make my own decisions.   Assignment 3: Compare and contrast Puritans and modern-day.  	I find it nearly impossible to compare something to “modern-day” culture, as that cannot be summed up in one group. There are millions of life-styles, and to put them all into one group is like to divide the world’s population into people with the “right” beliefs and those with “wrong” beliefs. However, there are certainly a lot less people that adhere to the belief that education is only necessary to understand the Bible. Education is still held highly, although. Another thing we share for the most part is taxes, and the belief that everyone can contribute to society by giving money to the government to fund things.    Assignment 4: Skim pages 1-356. Note interesting topics. •	Rebellion in the colonies •	Native Americans in general •	The Gold Rush •	Utopian Communities •	The Civil War •	Industrialization •	“A Revolution in Technology” •	World War I            Session 3  Assignment 1:  Create a map of the Thirteen Colonies. (seperate paper)  Assignment 2:  Investigate the origins of tobacco and how it affected the different nationalities and economy of those that settled in North America.  	Tobacco was all important in colonial times. It fueled the original “city” of Jamestown, as well as the expansion of Virginia with came about all because of this cash crop. It was taught to the settlers by the Native Americans, which we might owe to the positive relationships John Smith built up with them when he was still in the area. Not only that, but it is also the reason for the enslavement of an entire race. If it were not for the great need for thousands of workers in the fields because of how successful this crop was, there may have been no need to capture Africans and force them to work for nothing. It affected the settlers by making those owning plantations rich. Although we can attribute everything that came about in this era to all the cash crops, it was tobacco that was the main reason for slavery, the mercantile system, and everything in between.   Assignment 3: Research the Target Market Movement. What are current issues? How do these compare with colonial times?  	The issues now and then are very different. The main difference is that back then the issues focused around those trying to sell the tobacco, and now the main issue is in the effects on the community that it has. Back then, people only cared about how many slaves were due to ship in, or how much land they could acquire to grow their crop, or maybe the best place to sell their crop. Now, however, there are ads running about how many thousands of people die every month to tobacco, and how secondhand smoke kills a ton of people as well. It is interesting to see how society has changed. The tobacco companies may still be worried about the same things, but much of the general population has wised up and found there are more issues to worry about then growing seasons.   Assignment 4: Read page 54 and answer questions 1 through 4. Write your reaction to the issue of slavery. Who is being “enslaved” today?  1.	Equiano was completely unaware that such people in the world existed. He was obviously not suspecting such an abduction to occur. He also did not have time to react, as his mouth was covered before he could let out a cry. Equiano was probably confused to the point of unconsciousness. 2.	The treatment endured and observed by Equiano was terrible. He was beaten himself, and saw many others getting the same treatment. There was torture as punishment for the simplest mistakes, and he himself was flogged for denying food. 3.	It is difficult to tell Equiano’s reactions, as this piece of writing is very short and emotionless. He says each sentence with a certain starkness, as if it is all he can do to keep calm. Obviously it was beyond terrible, and yet he is able to simply retell the events. 4.	Equiano must have been a very strong person. It is not anyone ordinary that can withstand such torture and live through it. Being able to retell such events shows another kind of strength. He is able to recount what happened for the education of others, even if he is recalling something so terrible that he may simply want to be able to forget it ever happened.  Slavery is obviously terrible. There is nothing I can say that has not already been said a million times over. It was unjust, unfair, brutal, and there is nothing we can do to forget or forgive those that partook. We must simply consider that other societies have done similar things, and yet we are able to make fun of them. To make fun of the enslavement of Africans is complete taboo in modern society, yet people are able to hate others when we have killed so many Native Americans and Africans. It is important to remember slavery in America, as a proof that no nation is perfect. Sometimes Americans get this smug little view that nothing could possibly be better in an already perfect nation. They forget, however, that the world can change at the drop of a hat, and the past cannot be overlooked. The argument “That was then, this is now; besides, we were forgiven by African Americans” is useless. This memory must serve to remind us that we are human, and that a group of us can get together, make bad decisions, and ruin many peoples’ lives. Moving on…I believe that we are the only “slaves” today. We tend to trap ourselves in our own heads. Not everything that should be said is shared. Some things are shared that should not be. We are unable to judge what is right and what is wrong, and unable to distinguish between “different” and wrong. There is far too much misinterpretation of everything. People dare voice out their opinions when they know nothing. It is sad to see people jest others with no basis behind their argument. People need to remember that many people think they believing something is no basis for blind faith in that decision.   Assignment 5: Read a current event and write a response  	(On the issue of torture used by American troops) 	The only thing I have to say is… What do you expect? People are inherently bad. Especially ones that have hatred hammered into their head. Put a bunch of people with the thought “Iraqis are terrible people. Everything they believe in threatens my way of life. The only way to stop them is to kill them” engraved in their skull and then place them in a contained environment where they are bored and think that no one is watching…What do you expect? People think America would never torture others. In reality, the only way to see true behavior is when a person thinks no one is watching. There are so many things that are taboo these days that people covet privacy so they can be themselves. I think that this news story will hopefully awaken people to the fact that no country can be perfect. I am glad this information came out. There is no bliss in ignorance. It’s good to see the truth, even if it hurts.   Session 4  Assignment 1: Read Chapter 4. Complete “Putting Skills to Work” assignment on page 81.  The Road to Revolution	 Event	Year	Significance The Sugar Act	1764	First of many taxes to ensue anger in colonies The Stamp Act	1765	Another unfair tax that caused anger Townshend Acts	1767	Caused the boycott of British business The Boston Massacre	1770	Marked the first Americans to die for freedom The Boston Tea Party	1773	First effective display of American discontent  The Road to Revolution was merely as escalating show of American discontent. Obviously the British were imposing certain taxes on the colonies that they did not agree upon. The British, however, seemed the think that if they paid money for something that benefited America, then the cost should be shared. At first American’s seemed displeased only to the point of silent anger. That was soon to change, when the British pushed their limits in an attempt to set up what was basically a monopoly of America. Protests began to break out when nearly everyone was affected by the taxes. The Stamp Act, the Sugar act, and the Townshend Acts were all imposed on the colonies within three years of each other. These combined set up the monopoly on America. The Tea Act only added to American’s hatred. Protests became physical when the Boston Massacre occurred in 1770. Several people boycotting this British monopoly began to throw objects at the newly placed British patrols. The result was five dead Americans, and shock that Britain would react with such force. In the next few years, the violence continued escalating in small ways such as these. This left only one viable option for these two powers. War.   Assignment 2: What was the cause of the Boston Tea Party? What were its effects?  	The cause of the Boston Tea Party was general discontent. Britain simply pushed America too far in its taxing. Britain attempted to reach too deep into its neighbors’ pockets, which resulted in public showing of disapproval. When the Tea Act was implemented in 1773, Americans were supposed to buy tea only from the British East India Company, which was a private company. However, Dutch tea, if secretly obtained, was much cheaper. This, obviously, was not ok by the British. They imposed the Tea Act which lowered the cost of their company’s tea. The catch was that they were required to buy the tea directly from the British East India Company, thus reducing the American middle-men’s business. This was the cause of the showing of disapproval in Boston in November of 1773. The effect was Britain realizing that something must be done with this colony. Britain, realizing that their port was the backbone of Boston society at the time, chose to punish the colony by blocking all trade in the Boston port until the destroyed tea was paid for. On top of this, Britain emplaced the Intolerable Acts, named so because of their harshness. The only thing this accomplished was to increase anger levels in the colonies. Assignment 3: Map, on seperate paper. Assignment 4: What is the Declaration of Independence? Who and what influenced the content of it? Why is it one of the world’s most important documents?  	The Declaration of Independence is a formal statement representing the beliefs of America. It was written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 in order to state their independence from Britain. To sign it was treason against “their” king and empire that technically was in charge at the time. One of the main influences in this document is the issue of slavery. Having placed the statement “all men are created equal” in the declaration, proof was given about how true this actually was. Many of the members that signed it owned slaved themselves and were perfectly fine with it. It was still fueling the southern economy, after all. In order to represent all the colonies, Jefferson’s first draft, which attacked slave trade, had to be revised in order to please the southern colonies. It is one of the world’s most important documents because of what it accomplished. It laid the foundation for free thought and the right to change something you don’t like. Without it, America as we know it might still be owned by the British. It took a great deal of courage and faith to create and sign such a document, and luckily it was accomplished.   Assignment 5: What type of protest over government policy is going on today? What happened in Seattle in the year of 1999 called the “Seattle Tea Party?”  	In 1999, groups of people concerned about small businesses and how they would be affected by the coffee tax gathered in Seattle to protest. A 10 cent tax was to be voted on, and the money collected from the tax would be funneled into the education systems. Most agreed, but about 50 people rode down Seattle streets in a covered wagon. Coffee shops were accused of being overly greedy, but that didn’t stop some protesters to dump burlap sacks full of balloons (for an environmentally safe “reenactment”) into Green Lake. 	Protests that are going on today include ones targeted against government itself, one’s against the Bush Administration, and everything in between. There are people that disagree with everything going on in America, but for the most part, there are simply a lot of people that do not like George Bush. Most of the protesting going on is related to him and his “incoherent decision making.” However, there is a million small scale protests going on every day, including those related to city buses and a while back, nurses were protesting.
