I am currently thinking about writing my last poem entitled "Getting Hair on my nutz and jacking off"    Billy Corgan used a Native American flute player in his "solo acoustic" show at the Metro.  God save us all.    I am apparently in between a spat in the English building and still waiting on getting my paper back.    I plan on purchising Kill Bill Vol. 1.    I need to find my "motivation" for acting in English 100. (I plan on blocking the play and using a lot of jacking off motions)      School is futile, I'm only doing it so that I don't fail.    I need to see "Naked for Satan" and "Women in Cages."    Actually you need to see those two titles as well    I have been enjoying beer as of late.    Poetry is gay.    Poetry written in class while drunk on beer, Kaluha and wine is above average.    I didn't get tickets to see G n R plus Weiland for my B-day.  I'm mildly bummed    I'm bout ready to hunt down that fuck with the digital camera and take pictures of my foot up his ass.
