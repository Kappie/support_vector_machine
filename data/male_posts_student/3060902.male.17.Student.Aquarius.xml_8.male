Something feels missing... Life seems so meningless... Hai... Yawnz... My life revolves around the com... What kind of life goes around an inanimate object... I seriously have nothing to do if my dear com dies lah... Looks like i have to re-organise my life... Just tried to read the $75 SEA Bk... got thru all the way to page ten, intro included... Proud of myself... Maybe i can finish this Bk by next year... It's a start... Ha ha...  Mindless ramblings of someone who has nothing better to do... :-P
