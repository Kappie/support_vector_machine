I'm not exactly sure what I'll write up here but I like the idea of having a format that allows me to communicate in a thoughtful, meaningful way (as opposed to telephone, in person, , formats in which I tend to lose my train of thought)     My first attempt at doing something like this on my own web site failed horribly.     I've noticed a disturbing trend of people opening "xanga"s and to a lesser extent "live journal"s. This must end! For some reason I'm opposed to those two web sites but I'm not opposed to blogger--perhaps because blogger has a cool interface and is run by Google.     Hencefourth I will try to limit my usage of Internet words like "blog" and just call this a web log. In general, I will try to avoid using jargon (arr, I hate this word but I can't think of an equivalent) if possible. Right now I'm lamenting my choice of name for this web log; I should have just called it "Charly's" [For historical reference: at 9:08 p.m. on 8 June 2004 the web log is officially named "Charly's blog"]. I will try to remedy this with all deliberate speed.  Furthermore, I will try to use British English when possible. I think British English looks more elegant than American English. For a good guide to British English, go to  urlLink http://economist.com/research/StyleGuide/ ,  The Economist 's style guide. If you don't know what  The Economist  is, just know that it's a very good news magazine.  I don't have much else to do at this moment. I suppose I could work on my computer science final and/or project, but I lack the willpower.
