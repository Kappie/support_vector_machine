I've been sick with the flu all week. All my plans were screwed up and they even were messed up this morning when I sat up in bed and almost feel back because my head hurt so bad. So now I'm waiting on mom to go to the church service and hopefully play since I missed sunday school  again  this week. :-( What has this website turned into? Heh.
