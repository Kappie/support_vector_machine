Hunni, if this is the case, i am sorry, but you are one of my better friends, and this is a testimony to our year together....(Wow dodged that bullet pretty well i think). Oh and the boy in the background, Craig, is another previous love interest. Not as hot as he used to be though, and he was a bit stalkery when he and Karen broke up. But everyone suspects he's gay so its okay.
