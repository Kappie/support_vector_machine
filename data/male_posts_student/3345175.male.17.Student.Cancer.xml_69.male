"You would think that people woulda had enough of silly love songs..." alala   Dammit. I cant stop singing, or smiling, or wanting to dance and im just sooo happy and i just want him to be here right now and...damn.   Well, again, lets start with Daniel. I totally sorted things out with him, and i love how mature he was about it (not that i expected any less). We are now officially just friends, and its gonna stay that way. It would have to - coz now im all HAPPY with someone else. And there's no question that the someone else is who i wanna be with.  And now onto the main course, our feature presentation, our cover model. DAVID!!!! Mr David...Mr David...alala...  Man he is sooooo hot!  Right, okay, right...oh god...:D :D :D :D im too busy smiling and singing to concentrate.  Yeah, so after i got in on Sunday morning following the loverly party at Ali-Bally's, came in the house and spent a couple of hours with mum and on here. Then David invited me down to his to watch 'The Craft' with him and Nicola and Lynn. Needless to say, the two of us didnt see an awful lot of the movie...and Nic and Lynn didnt hear an awful lot of it either, which Nicola kept drawing us daggers for. We just made out for ages, bein really really flirty and stuff, fighting over the remote. Then we went for a walk up to McDonalds and even sitting at the train station we couldnt keep our hands off each other.  After that, Nicola invited the two of us to stay at hers, and we (or at least I) spent the whole evening in anticipation of people going to bed so we could be all over each other again ;). As soon as the very drunken (and kinda pervy for an old guy) Brian had left, me and David and Nic went to the large living room to watch Scooby Doo 2. Well all i can say is thank god her house was kinda cold! David was complaining bout being kinda cold, which was kinda cute in the "its so obvious you want me to warm you up" sorta way. So i did. I did the nice, good-Samaritan thing and warmed him up. For hours.  Of course all this was interrupted by the occasional brilliant bit of Scooby Doo 2, which we jst had to watch, and the teasing of Nicola over Brian, which i now think i took a bit farther than i shouldve. Was very funny, but got quite cruel.  Anywayz, Nicola forced us to go to bed. Not a good idea Nicola - like we were gonna sleep?! She's been great about this, being all happy and stuff for us. I havent seen her in so long, but recently me and Nicola have been getting closer again and i just have so much to thank her for: getting me and david together, introducing us in the first place, and being brave enough to face the possibility that she'll be stuck in the middle of any messes between me and him (which i pray there arent any of). I couldnt have asked for a better friend recently.  Anywayz, we spent hours in her lil bro's bed (does sound kinda dirty now, but didnt at the time), making out, getting a little bit adventurous and stuff. Just your basic experimentation that leaves you absolutely ecstatic and all on a high and stuff. And then we fell asleep. Oh wait - this was after all the distracting stuff that i coulda killed Nicola (txting bout her vibrator: "hhhowwww dddoooo yyoouuuu ttuuurrrnnn theeee fffuckkkkerrrr offfff?"), the shelf and fireplace that both decided to attack David, and our stomachs growling (id love to say it was because we wanted each other so badly, but it was probably coz we hadnt eaten). But none of it mattered, like at all, and we just spent the whole morning kissing.  Then we were awkwardly awoken by said lil brother, who was rather confused and stammered bout having to get his school stuff. Heehee. The look on his face. And all i could say was "Jeezo" when really i was dying to just jump right back on top of David.  When i had to leave i just couldnt. I mustve spent ten minutes saying goodbye to him. Id planned on just the normal little peck on the lips to say bye, but somehow he ended up against the wall with me pressed against him. I dont think he wanted me to leave either, judging by how he was holding me.  The boy is actually driving me crazy, and i know ive said most of this in my LiveJournal for those who read it. But he's just...perfect. And even his imperfections that i know of so far are great and fascinating and just make me want him more. I soooo want the feeling i have just now to last for as long as humanly possible, or even better the feeling i had the other night at Nicola's. I wouldnt even need to be kissing him for that long. It does sound, as Daniel would put it, very "cancer-movie" but just seeing him smile in that way when we've just kissed, and he knows we're gonna kiss summore, makes me so wanna just pin him down and do naughty things...lol just joking. Okay not totally, obviously coz hes my boyfriend and im very sexually attracted to him as well as his personality kicking ass. But im taking it as slow as he wants. I've had and seen too many relationships wrecked by rushing into things, and i wont push him. Im now completely off my "King of Slutdom" phase, and i honestly cant see me going back to it anytime soon. Im happy enough right now with what i have, and if it keeps feeling half as good as this, then im like him: i want this to work.  Man i know half of this is sad, but i dont care.   Im so freaking happy.  I could just sing forever now.
