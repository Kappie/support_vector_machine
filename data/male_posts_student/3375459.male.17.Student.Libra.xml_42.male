Hey, but my mum liked it. =) True enough, the place was just empty and people started changing seats. I'm not going to be a spoilsport and blab out the movie, you guys out there reading this, please check this movie out ok? Maybe you'll learn that keeping a promise till the end could mean a lot to someone waiting.   Grab some prawn tako balls as we headed down to the mrt station. Mum never did like the watery uncooked texture of the balls.. Huh... Woke up earlier then usual today, so I think I might catch a little nap later~
