Helloooo, has anyone ever heard of positive reinforcement? Yeah, that means you're encouraging in bad situations, not telling them that all hope is lost and you're not going to go anywhere in life. Gee, thanks Mom, for all your support. Would you like me to just throw my hands up and say "Yeah, I'm going to Austin-Peay or MTSU? Just so you won't have to waste your precious money on American because I obviously won't rise to your expectations and will simply be a waste of money."  Fuck that, I'm gonna do some homework or just rant some more.
