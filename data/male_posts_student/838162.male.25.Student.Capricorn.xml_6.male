Then again like  urlLink Tess  wrote, sometimes its not good to be sitting in front of the computer all day long. Now I have been accused of living in Netspace too much of my waking life, but sometimes the Meat needs some actual social contact.  So I was out for lunch with the guys after church. The weather was wet and cold (I love this kind of weather, quite refreshing. I think both AmberLight and LadyRaine would agree with me on this one) so we spent some time walking in the rain and just catching up. We finally ended up at our  urlLink favorite LAN shop  where we had a few rounds of  urlLink DOD  action. I know that in the end I was still in front of a Comp Screen, but it's different when you're interacting with your friends and you are all in the same location. I guess thats the attraction of LAN shops even though  urlLink broadband  is so easily found nowadays. It's gets kinda loney playing online at home without hearing the cheers and groans of your gaming buddies around you.  I guess this explains that the only kind of computer game that really interests me nowadays are MMORPGs or Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games. These games allow oneself to log on to a constantly on-going and ever-changing environment together with thousands of users all across the world. You get to interact with the other users (share, trade or just chat, depending on the game environment) which I find is much more interesting than just playing a set story with just the computer. Here, the story is ever-changing and even goes on without you when you're offline. But best of all is that you get to be a part of the story, that your actions have some effect no matter how small.  I started with  urlLink Anarchy Online  but stopped has it was getting stale, then was looking into  urlLink Earth  Beyond  (I like sci-fi stuff) but discovered that there are alot of locally based MMORPGs coming up, like  urlLink Shadowbane  for example.The benefit of local ones is that most of the other people playing are locals and better to relate and reach out to them. Another reason is that some events in the game are time based and with a local one I can finally have these events take place when I'm awake.  All in all it's a pretty good weekend. Can't wait for the next one...and the next one. The countdown continues.  Happy Surfing!  >
