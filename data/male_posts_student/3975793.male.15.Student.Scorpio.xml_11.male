I thought i might have been over-reacting when i was describing them to someone, but no. They are just simply  that  amazing. Lets start at the begining of the story, shall we?:    ~*~ ~*~ ~*~     BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ. The alarm goes off, it says 8:57. I glance at it, mumble the word "marf" under my breath, and bury my face into my pillow as i say to myself, "it's only wednesday...". My life couldn't get any more dull. I had to fight for a reason not to just sit there in bed and veg. eventually, the reason came though. unfortunate for me, it came in the form of 65 lbs of fur and drool. My dog lunges at me to wake me up, I can't stand it, and i think he knows it :\ I look over at the alarm clock again, 9:30. "I hate you with a passion" i says. Time flew by pretty fast after standing in the shower staring at the wall for about 20 minutes. and before i knew it, i was at my drawing desk, ready to draw. I looked around for my set of cheap, no good colored pencils that are normally scattered amongst the clutter that is, "my desk". but today was different. "Wait a second... (pulls out shopping bag). I shall suffer no more! (pulls out prismacolor pencil set!)". And there they were, all 48 of them, sitting inside the box just waiting to be opened. Oh how sweet vicotry tastes my freind. And when i finally open up the box that was my pride and joy, the taste of victory suddenly went bitter. I open the box only to find that the pencils do not come presharpened. "No need to worry, just a minor set-back is all." i couldn't have been more wrong. I go to my pencil sharpener and try to sharpen my pencils, but it wont fit. I try and try, but it just wont fit! I dig through every drawer in the house looking for a pencil sharpener and nothing will fit the little bundles of joy! I finally give up and go plop down on my bed. staring up at the ceiling, wondering why i was being punished so. Then, it hit me. I went into my closet, reached for a small box from when i was in first grade, opened it up and to my amazment: Saw my Penuts(tm) Pencil Sharpener! I remembered that it had the extra wide hole for sharpening those thick pencils they used to give us in kindergarden. I was well on my way to paradise! i go to my desk, sharpen all my pencils, and get set. I had my peice of paper in hand, my work space was clear, Reference pictures were at hand. And alas! nothing came to mind. I had waited and waited for this moment, and I could not think of anything to cristen the S.S. Prismacolor with. Fate is cruel, cruel and very unusual. And every time something good happens to me, it gets worse and worse. I take an old sketch of mine, grab my old red colored pencil, and begin to shade premiscuously. "Pass the green... no... the other green."
