I have been trying to duplicate that for some time on the SGI using POV-RAY and finally succeeded.  This is a view of the charge (electrostatic surface) of the protein I study after it binds to a substrate.  Red is negative blue is positive. This blog was posted from the SGI.  Ok, I've been here too long.  I'm going home.
