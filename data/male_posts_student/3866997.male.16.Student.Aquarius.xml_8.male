He was gorgeous and this only added to my attraction to his personality. I couldn't help myself and leaned over and kissed him. Two girls down in the front row of the theater noticed this. They proceeded to move from about 15 rows away to about 4 rows away. They were obviously confused by what they had seen, but I paid them no mind. We went about our business, and I, being Mr. Affection as usual, held Bryan's hand and snuggled and kissed. The girls began to giggle and say hurtful things. Finally things worsened, and they began to throw things at us. Bryan was becoming more and more uncomfortable every second, I could tell. They moved right up next to us and asked if we were gay. At this point, I was pissed, so I said, "Does this answer your question?" and gave Bryan a nice big deep kiss. They started throwing insults amongst other things again and I just continued doing what I was doing. After the movie they followed us out into the hall where Bryan just left me without even a goodbye. At this point I was hurt and pissed, and they kept bothering me. They followed everywhere I went and when I finally stopped proceeded to question me about my sexuality. I am patient and understanding to the utmost, and out of fear their questions being honest I answered them. They asked me about 8 or 9 things and I answered them all, even though each of my answers was followed up with some sort of comment about how disgusting I was. They said that it was pointless to be gay because I was hated by everyone and couldn't even get married. Eventually I lost my cool and told them I would go get a Cop if they didn't leave me the fuck alone... "There's no use in being gay. Everyone hates you fags. You can't even get married!" This summarizes it. I used to think gay marriage was a matter of gays wanting state recognized unions. I personally hate the fact the government has anything to do with marriage to begin with. Now, I personally will spend the rest of my life working in every way I can to make gay marriage a reality. It has nothing to do with wanting to be able to file joint taxes. ITS ABOUT RESPECT! Bush's constitutional amendment about only recognizing heterosexual marriages is just another way of the government pretending our love is just some sick sexual fetish. Its an official declaration that we are freaks and that cannot be allowed. For years we have been mistreated, slandered, misunderstood, and sometimes killed because we dont hide who we are and even in this so called "enlightened age" where we believe the human mind is no longer hindered by silly psychological barriers we are still treated like a side show. Governments, religions, and organizations across the world still think we are just something to point at and go, "HOW DIGUSTING!" Well how dare you judge us! The fact is, if anyone, gay or straight, had their sex life exposed to the public it would shock and horrify all of us! It is true we are more accepted now than we once were, but that doesn't mean we should stop fighting! So many gay boys just sit on their asses and watch others get ripped to shreds for who they are. UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL! We must fight together for a right more fundamental than any other. The Revolutionaries faught for the right to self-government. The black community fought for the right to be treated as equal. They are heralded as heroes. We, the gay community fight for something much more fundamental than any of this. We fight for the right to LOVE. Yet, we are treated as animals. To the United States Government: GET BACK TO THE BASICS ASSHOLES! "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are  LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE  PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."   The Moral of the Story: "We must live together as brothers, or we will die together as fools".
