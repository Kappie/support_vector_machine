The I had band, and um, Lots of people wern't there, Only 1 clarinet, and we played good. Then Mats and Italian, nothing eventful except Tom coming in at 10:10, then R-e-c-e-s-s, then, um, Extended pastoral (WASTE OF TIME) then English (lots of fun) . At L-u-n-c-h i went to a Hockey meeting for field hockey (that made sense), then I did Computer Tech stuff, and then Music lesson, lost of fun, then T-E-X-T-I-L-E-S. Bah. Not much else, bag was heavy today, my back hurts, Maybe I'll go lie down. Lots of people were absent, probably due to Rock Eistefford.
