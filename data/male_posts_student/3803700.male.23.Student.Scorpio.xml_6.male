I hate it even more that he got paid more to hit those balls than I will ever see in at least the next 10 years, and he will make more money this baseball season than I will in my entire life.  Unless you are Spiderman, and you run around saving people’s lives no one deserves to make that much money to play a GAME! Of course Alex Rodriguez was watching his Yankee teammate from the rich kid dugout, he was probably trying to come to terms with the adjustments he will have to make since he accepted a slight pay cut to become a New York Yankee.  George W. Bush and his business partners sold the Texas Rangers for a hefty $250 million in the late 1990s, soon after that, that team signed Alex Rodriguez for $252 million for 10 seasons.  Today “A-Rod” plays for the Yankees and makes roughly $16,000 per at bat.  I thought about buying a new Subaru for $16,300, which to A-Rod is an at bat, and a pinch run, in the end I could not afford it.  Now I am not angry about the fact that at 23 I already have more education that Mr. Rodriguez and I am poor and he is rich, I am mad because his salary has killed baseball.  I am mad because all of the pro “athletes” make enough money to feed the whole world, all of it, the whole thing, and they usually don’t even pay for their own meals.  It is out of control, and when Usama Bin Laden tells his followers that the US is full of hedonistic, materialistic, rich guys, I look at what we pay our entertainers and athletes, and I agree with him, and that makes me mad.
