(thank you to anyone that came to see us play) The game just sucked b/c we almost came back in the second half but then we fubled twice. i heard the dance team did good thought so thats cool.  and jessica came to my game! and i got to see her afterwards.  i was soo tired after the game though so we just chilled for a little bit then she had to go home and i passed out.  then today my mom made me a 9:00 haircut... yeah 9 o clock in the morn!! omg it sucked but its all good i made it though.  after that i came home for awhile and cleaned out my desk dawer and found a bunch of stuff i didnt know i had it was kinda cool.  then jessica came over at about 1.  we made (and ate lol) some cookies for bryndan for his birthday which by the way is tomorrow if anyone didnt know (Damn big 17) and then after showin jes my new shirts for a while we went over to her house for a hour :)... and then from there i went to church which i was almost late for :p lol but i made it.  we ate the best fish after church tonght lol i love food!  now bryndan is spending the night and we are wakin up early tom to go to new orleans!! hooray its gonna be bryndans birthday.  i hope the saints win, look for our football team on tv! my birthday doesnt really seem like a big deal to me this year for some reason.  o well lol.  life is going great right now. im always happy and looking foward to things and ppl.  despite how busy i am and how things are around here, im still fairly relaxed.  i hope everybody who reads this is havin a great day and a great life.  i'll talk to yall later. :)
