It feels like the dorms. My old place was a 3 bedroom with family room, living room, huge kitchen, loft and backyard). I'm on a month to month lease so if I find a larger place.  Living here will be a dramatic change for me. I miss the fast pace of NY already (my old place was 4 blocks from Central Park). My old high school football buddy, Jose, is also attending Yale and lives a block away. He offered to show me around town.  I have a new girlfriend (my best friend), Erin Caberra-Wong. She is 28, still lives in NY, and is a substitute teacher. We hooked up after returning from England. Cody's wedding was insane. Ash's parents shelled out 40k and his parents chipped in 30k. Everything was overdone and elaborate. I brought a copy of the video for my family to see and now my mother is already planning  my  wedding and my little bro's wedding (he's 16).  After school starts, I'll be MIA so get your Derick fix while you still can.
