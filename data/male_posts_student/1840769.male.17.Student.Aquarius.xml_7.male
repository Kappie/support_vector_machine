Everyone has the same reaction towards my presence in NTU.hahaa..but oh wells i guess things arent always that typical.  My life in NTU revolves around  canteenA, LT7, toilet,TR37,library(currently at),bustop at canteen a to squeeze up the 179 bus..haahah...really have a battle to fight just to get a spot on the bus..  Life in singapore is realy hectic..and i really give all my respect to all you NTU people because the number of modules that you guys have to take is exceedingly overwhelming.  ill continue to make my time in NTU a memorable one in its own way..haahh..at least at the end of it all i get to keep my BLUE NTU matric card which prevents me from buying a bus concession.Thanks man.=p  aite..time to head towards the toilet and lt7 again.. cheerio jiam   PS: yes do come for the saturday night event..it would really be a good time to get started on a very important thing-prayer. We should never leave that out. Come and meet God.
