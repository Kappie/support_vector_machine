Pack your thoughts,  pack your mind,  pack your sadness  and let go  Cause when you pack Your all existence  becomes a little bag!  And you're free, yes you're free from all those things you did and said  Free from your possession, free from rent and reallocation getting established in your profession improving technic of masturbation  So, pack,  as long as you can,   pack and disappear.  --  I'm not so good with rhyming in English, next time I'll write without those rhymes.  Till next time,  Yi Tai.
