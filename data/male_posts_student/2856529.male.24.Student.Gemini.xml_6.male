Its not that I have been putting it off(well yes, I have) but its just that I did not want to explore another channel which would force me to keep in touch with people whose mails I am too lazy to respond or havenothing incommon with to return their phonecalls. But I did join it anyway. Tried orkutting(googling just does not sound right over here) some of the BITS Pilani communities and was surprised to find just that just about any one i know was already anorkutter (do you sense a pattern here?). The good part about orkut i guess is that people don't find it intimidating so I guess just about everyone I know(read girls) have posted their pictures My guess is that since orkut is a google product people instantly assume their info will not b tampered with. But I know atleast 23 people who will be very interested to know that photographs of certain girls from my batch are online even though they have managed to keep their yahoo ids a secret or made sure all their online photos are private so none of the gults in my batch can access them. Well anyway I shall continue on my journey through the webpages of orkut to find out more long lost friends and acquaintance and photograph of the hot chicks of batches past and future and post my thoughts if I think they will provoke any thoughts from anyone who bothers to visit my site.
