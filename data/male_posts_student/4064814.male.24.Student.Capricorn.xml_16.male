Well, Jeff and I found a place to live this past weekend and its pretty sweet.   It's a small house, but we have it all to ourselves.  The exterior gives it this ramshackle look, with weathered unpainted wood and holes in the porch floorboards, but the inside has been totally redone.  We have a spacious living room and kitchen (with its own island!), and a patio in the back with a garden.    It's at  urlLink Weber and Marshall  so its a little farther away, but its still close enough for groceries (and the beerstore).
