At first I didn't want to cus I was already lying on my bed, but when he visited my blog and told me tt I didn't update it today, I had no choice. L0L! So I decided to come back online to send him his photos and at the same time update my blog. Hehe.  Well, I went to school like 12:30pm today to try and get my report book, but my form teacher said tt I couldn't get it. She said she would onli gif after the talk, which starts at 2pm and ends like 4pm. So, I was basically slacking in school and wasting time. I was supposed to go out to who knows where wif the lil' pig and the fat pussy cat, but tt nvr happened. I do not wish to elaborate on why.  So when I was finally able to leave the school, it was already 6pm. Me, Benson and Chee Chong went to Ginza to haf dinner and play pool. We ate dinner at this Sakura restaurant and the bill was $44.55, but it was pretty worthwhile. Compared to other restaurants, this is 1 of the cheapest tt I've been to so far. After dinner, We went to play pool for an hour. It was the first time tt I was playing wif them cus I'll usually onli play wif Anwar. I paid for the game, which was $7 den I went home.  I bought this Winning Eleven 7 game, which cost me $6, frm some pirated game shop. It's realli fun compared to Fifa '04. The graphics and gameplay are basically betta. But I do get tired of playin wif the com at times cus it juz isn't real. If some1 would come over to my place to play it wif me, den tt will definitely be much more fun. It's such a waste tt I do not haf an elder blood brother. Haha, I can imagine tt man. We'll probably be playing the com together and wrestling in the room. I'll oso haf the chance to play pool more often as he would be the one paying. Ahaha, but well I dun haf an elder blood bro, so I juz haf to live life the way it is and well, do those stuffs wif frens instead. L0L! Guess I'll stop here for today. Cya! =]
