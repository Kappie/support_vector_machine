Lets see, do I take the stairs and attempt to improve my cardiovascular health to the potential detriment of my knee and hip joint health, or do I opt for the elevator and decrease my chances of developing osteoarthritis. Of course, none of this would be a problem if I could swim up to my office on the fourth floor, or maybe even take a mobile version of that Gazelle(R) thing that guy with the pony-tail hawks at three a.m. on virtually every station. Honestly, if I am watching television at three a.m. (which I do), I have larger (pun) problems than a small penis (not sure), the need to exercise (pretty good at that), or really tough stains (like blood—okay maybe that is a problem) (Plead the fizith).   The most difficult time I have, however, is with the cafeteria. I did mention that I am with the Department of Health and Human Services, right? A quick review, this is the department (the largest in the Federal government) that produced the wonderful thing we know as the food pyramid (figure one), as well as serving as the home to the USDA and the FDA.   [Side note: confidential sources say that the other two major contenders for the symbol that would be used to help millions of Americans to remember the very difficult concept of six food groups (ah hah, and the number of servings) were (1) the food pie; and (2) the food lion. There were obvious difficulties associated with both. First, the food pie, although visually pleasing, led to some confusion among test groups who began eating nothing but pie (Side note of a side note: the pie diet turned out to be a front-runner when Dr. Atkins was trying to decide which asinine diet plan he would use to make our morbidly obese nation even more unhealthy). The food lion was an early favorite, but PETPA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Pictures of Animals) quickly stepped in and shot that idea down much like the black rhino hunter shoots down the beautiful black rhino.]   Let us turn back to the cafeteria. It is clear that the cafeteria is NOT based on the food pyramid; unless, of course, you turn the pyramid upside down, replace the fruits and vegetable group with an overripe fruit and creamed vegetable group, insert a deep-fried whatever-the-hell group, and finally, add the vending machine group. Sure, I suppose I could get the salad everyday; but daily wilted lettuce with a sliced up egg and low-fat ranch will eventually weigh on souls of even the most health conscious. Being that it is this difficult to get a healthy meal in the Department of Health and Human Services, it is certainly no mystery why we had the first American Yokozuna[1] a couple of years ago.  With regard to obesity, I will not bore you with the statistics; suffice to say that they are alarming at the least. There are two thought processes in the American mind that need to be addressed, lest we end up disappearing like the dinosaurs.   [Side note: Most scientists believe that the dinosaurs became extinct due to starvation, an ice-age, or some asteroid strike; however, no one (to my limited knowledge) has proposed the perfectly reasonable hypothesis that the dinosaurs ate themselves to death. For example, perhaps T-rex made a habit of eating the high-fat brachiosaurus, as opposed to the high-fiber pterydactyl. Next thing you know, T-Rex is turning 23 and on his third heart attack. Hell, maybe all the dinosaurs went crazy on some Atkins-esque diet and just dropped dead (although considerably slimmer at the time).]   The first concept that we must break away from is the concept of “getting your money’s worth.” I was raised this way, as were most other (99%) of Americans to which money was an object. Let’s do an example: Joe P. Average is faced with a decision. He can either: 1) buy two Cheeseburgers, large fries, and a 188 oz drink for $3.29, or 2) buy a package of all-natural, earthy, whole-grain crackers for $3.29. Joe knows two things about the McD’s(R) meal: 1) it will make him full for several hours, and 2) it tastes pretty good. Joe also knows two thing about the crackers: 1) they will keep him full for 30 minutes, at which point Joe will have to spend more money, and 2) they taste like sh*t (edited so my mother can read it). Joe may also be distantly familiar with the fact that consistently eating McDonald’s(R) will harm his long-term health. With all his knowledge, Joe proceeds to conduct an internal cost-benefit analysis. Those of you that are familiar with the concept of “present value[2]” will understand why Joe chooses to eat at McDonald’s(R).  The long-term costs of unhealthy eating (knocking 10-15 years off his life, thousands of dollars in personal medical expenses, billions in Federal health care expenditures) do not cast a significant weight on Joe’s decision….damnit Joe, wake up. After everything is calculated (even the utility Joe loses from eating the crap-tasting rice crackers), the crackers actually are the best value. Choose the crackers Joe, and “Get your money’s worth.”   Unfortunately, it is very difficult to convert a nation of people who are (for the most part) obsessed with “getting their money’s worth” in the present tense to a nation of people who are dedicated to “getting their money’s worth” in the long-run. Can you imagine someone going to Golden Corral(R) and having a nice salad….sure, maybe, but the salad is usually immediately followed by 3 steaks, a plate of wings, a slice of pizza, mashed taters, and a bowl of ice cream with strawberries, chocolate, and sprinkles. After all, you could not possibly let the owners of the Golden Corrall(R) make a dime off of you;  screw them , you work hard for your money, and you will get your money’s worth. And lets not even get started on Chinese Buffet; many believe it is their patriotic duty to put those  sons-of-bitches  out of business by eating 23 plates of crap. We must change the way we think.   We also need to discard the idea that anything other than eating less calories and burning more calories will lead to healthy, sustained weight loss. As much as I hate that guy with the pony-tail, he is right—get your ass on the Gazelle(R) for a least 30 min a day. As much as I hate Whole Foods(R), eating some of that crap is necessary.    FACT: People hate working out…well, the average American hates working out. Some actually enjoy it and/or obsess about it (obsessing is not healthy in a different way....it makes people hate you).   FACT: People hate eating healthy…well, the average American hates eating healthy. Some actually enjoy it…no, that’s complete crap, no one  really enjoys eating healthy (even if they think they do); it goes against human nature.    Think about it, five to six million years ago the first bipedal hominid (apparently our ancestors… so say the smart folks ) stood up on his back feet and thought… I’m hungry …what did he find? Twigs and berries. Meat, milk, and chocolate were very tough to come by. Finally, in the last 100 years, the US has moved toward providing a ridiculous amount of food to the majority of the population. Do you honestly think that 100 years of food-a-plenty is enough to reverse 5 million years of natural selection toward those bipedal hominids that consume as much food as they can get their hands on. What do you think  homo erectus  would do at Golden Corral(R)? You can be damn sure that crazy SOB would get his money’s worth, and then probably ask for the extra animal skins to wear home.  So what do you think is going to happen when Whole Foods(R) dangles the twig and berries while McDonald’s(R) flops down meaty, juicy beef?  We homo sapiens will be compelled by millions of years of habit to go for the beef or butter or cheese or deep-fried anything or (heaven forbid) an entire loaf of bread.  As if all this is not enough, a fat person walking into Whole Foods(R) has to put up with psychological pressure somewhere on the level of what I (Illinois country boy) would experience walking down the streets of Baghdad, wearing my Toby Keith t-shirt, and singing God Bless the USA. (We’ll talk about Toby Keith later).   This is the point at which we must separate ourselves from the animals. It was not until Orwell’s animals became cognizant of their situation that they chose to break from the power of instinct (not that I think obesity has anything to do with socialism) and improve their lives. A dog (or any other animal), when presented with limitless food, will eat until it is obese and unhealthy; actually, I think I have heard stories of dogs eating themselves to death. It does not do this because it enjoys eating (have you ever tasted dog food?). It does this because of instinct. The dog does not think:  will this make my ass fat?  (consequently there are no eating disorders among animals); or  will this raise my cholesterol?  A dog just eats.   We must exercise our sense of reason…yeah, I said it, personal responsibility. Some people literally sh*t themselves when they are told that a person is responsible for any aspect of their condition; they sh*t themselves and then they blame it on someone else. Of course all this eating would not be a problem if we would get off our butts and move a bit. Please note that I realize certain people have a genetic predisposition to be a particular weight, and that weight may not correspond with the expected “norm” of our skinny-crazy culture. I do not think everyone can or should look like skin-and-bones “super models” that love to take their shirts off and show off their sexy pancreas'; I do, however, think that everyone (save those with metabolic/ psychological disorders) can sustain a healthy weight.

([2]The concept of Present Value basically means that Joe does not give a sh*t about the future (or at least, less of a sh*t)).
