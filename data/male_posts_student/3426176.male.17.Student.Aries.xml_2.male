I was shopping for a multitude of necessities for my trip to Italy.  I got shorts, a few shirts, a toiletries pouch and some chips, but that was for the seemingly endless car rides to a new store.  We also searched for gifts for my exchange student and his family.  I think we did well.  The only thing is that when you are around my mum for a long time, she tends to get... how do I say it... oh yeah, annoying.  It's not bad, it's just... annoying.  It's hard to explain, but she just endlessly blabbers on about stuff.  Oh well, it's all good.  I would rather have that than if she was silent all the time.  I also missed watching the Fire game online.  Because I'm a cheap bastard, I don't subscribe to get all of the MLS games on satelite so I have to watch the home Fire games on my computer that has a shaky on-line connection.  I guess I will wake up early tomorrow and watch the replay online.  I will be going to bed late because the Los Angeles Galaxy v. Dallas Burn match is on tonight at 00:30.  That's 12:30 AM if you don't speak European.  Ugh, it is going to be a late night.  One more thing.  My dad went to the currency exchange and he exchanged $300 and we got 240 Euros back.  The Euros are cool b/c they are different colours and different sized depending on the bill.  For example, the 5 Euro bills are green and roughly 6.5 x 12 cm.  The 10 Euro bills are red and roughly 7 x 12.5 cm.  And the 20 Euro bills are blue and roughly 7.5 x 13 cm.  I like how they are different colours and different sizes.  That's just real cool.  And I forget that it is money and treated as such because I am so used to seeing dollar bills.  These just seem like coloured play money.  I almost lost it a few times.  That certainly would suck.  OK, off I go.  Big day tomorrow... OK, today.  It just turned midnight.  I have to watch Los Angeles v. Dallas, Fire v. Colorado, Indy 500, and Coca-Cola 600 tomorrow.  Someone has to do it.  It may as well be me.  Bye.
