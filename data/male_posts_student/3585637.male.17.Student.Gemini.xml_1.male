Its getting boring sia.. And teams like GREECE is in the semi final of the competition.. Yah , yesterday France did play poorly , but they shouldn't be out of the tournament so early... And yah, fei fei .. Thank for ur 90% France sure win prediction.. whahaa.. And France lose the match.. lolX.. So no onli left Holland in euro2004 that i hope they can win it.. So starting from tonite.. Hope they can at least win Sweden and qualify for the next round...Cheers for Holland..
