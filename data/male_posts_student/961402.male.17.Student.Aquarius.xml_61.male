So I suppose now it's my sacred duty as a blogger to post a play-by-play of the past three weeks, lest my massive global audience spontaneously combust in anticipation. Just look at how many comments I've gotten:-). Some of the neatest stuff is the most recent, but I'll be getting to that later. I'll probably refer to Laura's ultra-detailed dairy for more detail later, but this'll do for now.  Day one starts on next post.
