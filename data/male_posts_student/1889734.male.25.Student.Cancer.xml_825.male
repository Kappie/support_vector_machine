Here is what appears on the Georgia Department of Revenue web site regarding the Real Estate Transfer tax.  "The real estate transfer tax is not a property tax. It is an excise tax on the privilege of selling property."  Privilege???  Granted by whom?  Do we or do we not own our own land (unfortunately, the answer is 'no, we don't').  This is the kind of thing that is all too common nowadays, akin to Mark's post about 'Mandatory Registration'.  We just accept it and move on, without really considering what it means on a deeper level.  If you accept this statement, you endorse the idea that the State government owns your property, since they grant the 'privilege' of selling it.    Welcome to serfdom.  And thank a Leftist....
