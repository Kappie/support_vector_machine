I didn't relize I lost it until yesterday (Sunday) and today after many questioning of everyone, I finally found out Elisa gave it to Mr. Benzinger, Mr. Benzinger gave it to this cool kid Tom D who claimed it was his but it wasn't. When I ended up getting it back by telling the main office to call him down, I was so happy so when I went to gym I went phsyco on Chris Michaelis and those cool cats. It was hilarious because as I was leaving the main office with Tom, the lady said Happy New Years and I said you too not relizing what she had said until I walked out and after I said you too. Track was too easy except for the two 11th graders who know I'm Kate Murphy's cousin, so they decided to take all my stuff out of my locker and throw it all over the locker room but it was funny when I found one of my shoes dangling from a window sill. I played a bit of Ultimate Frisbee, wow Shaun is amazing. Ok, so anyways Matt Kaiser brought me and Paul home, then the day ended. Everything done... I just can't wait to see The Matrix, I fucking hate Mr. Keyes, he made the god damn concert the night The Matrix comes out, maybe I'll skip school to see it, I'm not sure. All I know is, if I go on Friday, fuck the track meet, I'm seeing The Matrix with reserved tickets in advance at Loews.
