Tefft Street in Nipomo  We arrived about 6:30 and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. All the tables in the restaurant are close together. (about 16-20 tables) We were seated at a table for 4 near a window (and right next to the only other couple).     Don  ordered Diet Coke, garden salad with bleu cheese dressing and one of the specials for the evening, Lasagna with meat sauce.  Andy  ordered Sprite and a small double cheese pizza.(10")  Liz  ordered Water, garden salad and Spaghetti with Meat Balls  Our waiter, brought our drinks promptly and also a basket of warm bread and butter.  The bread was dense and chewy and very good.  The garden salads were very fresh with a mix of salad greens, thin onion slices, a few slices of tomato, and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The dressing was on the salad and was just the right amount.    As we waited for our food (not very long-timed nicely with the bread and salads), the restaurant began to fill up.  When we left most of the tables were full.  Don - Large serving, meaty  (***) brought 1/2 home. Andy - pizza was very good, finished it all.  (****) Liz - small meatballs, meaty sauce, plenty of sauce and parmesean cheese.  Meatballs were bland.  The sauce had a surprising cinnamon taste and probably had some cream.  (***)  Large serving-brought 1/2 home   Overall rating:  *** (3 of 5)  Atmosphere (***)  Food (***)  Cost ($$$$$)
