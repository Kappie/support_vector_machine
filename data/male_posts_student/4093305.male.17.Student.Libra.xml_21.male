Disgruntled members of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, who have been locked in a protracted labor dispute with the city, plan to hound and heckle Boston Mayor Tom Menino during the four-day convention that opens in one week.      Sounds pretty tight. Hopefully the NYC police will chime in and do their part for the Republican National Convention, too.   _ _ _ _ _ _     Hmmm...  urlLink Trickle-up economics?     Apparently the Washington Post did an analysis of the Bush Administration tax plan and found that the tax cuts on the wealthy put the burden on the poorer folk. Well, isn't it obvious? Now, there's supposed to be a second round of them, which would make the distribution of wealth even worse in the country. Apparently, even Bush realized that it was a dumb plan, but he doesn't really sound too smart when he says it.       According to a transcript, the president, George Bush, questioned the strategy. "Haven't we already given money to rich people? This second tax cut's gonna do it again," he reportedly said. "Shouldn't we be giving money to the middle?"        You have to wonder who exactly these economists that they hire are and where they got their degrees. More importantly, you have to question who picks them in the first place. Obviously the people that are making economic decisions for their countries and the world wouldn't know decent economics if Joseph Stiglitz was biting them in the ass.
