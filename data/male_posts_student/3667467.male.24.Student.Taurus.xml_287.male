I got lost (again) and went the wrong way, then got to the library late to find out I 1. did not have my Interlibrary Loan card and 2. could have done it online. A car drove down the wrong side of the road and almost hit me head-on. Then I was 30 minutes late for church and had a gas tank on E. The sermon was "The Gospel According to The Simpsons: Homer" so maybe it was worth it.
