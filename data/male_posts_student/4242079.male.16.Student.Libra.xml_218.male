I also hate waking up to the sound of an alarm clock, or pans falling on the floor in the kitchen above my room. Rain is a pleasant medium. Although, it is late October, and it really shouldn't be raining today. There's usually snow by now, isn't there? When I was growing up, there was snow by now. The last few years, I don' tthink there has been. No matter. There were days when I would wake up early every morning just to peek through the blinds and see if snow had fallen. Those days are gone, and now I just see snow as something I have to brush off of my car. It can be beautiful though. I'm rambling, and probably boring you people. I should clean today.   I'm a sexy monkey!
