It was funny, today I drumming air drumming with my pen and it took me about 5 minutes to realize I had blown up the pen and gotten ink all over me and on my books and furniture. I'm listening to all the cds I got for Christmas, and later I'm going to drum and play some games, then sleep. Yea, I'm happy I'm back in the drumming routine. My New Years Resolution is 800x600...no I'm acting more mature, responsible, adult-like...shit like that. And no more dumb negative shit on this blogger that has nothing to do with the blogger. Speaking of blogger, it's almost been a year. I cannot wait for Goo's Blogger's Birthday! It's going to be so happy, joyful, and gay. Yea bitch, I bet you didn't see that one coming. Ok, well I better get going, gotta finish up Euro homework. This really sucks, but I'm gonna be a good boy about it because I'm growing up and becoming a more responsible and mature man...I hope. Cya.
