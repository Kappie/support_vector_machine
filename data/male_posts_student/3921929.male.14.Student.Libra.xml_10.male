I went to the skatepark for the first session (12:00-4:30), came home and ate, went to Matt's house to skate, and finally came home and skated some more. At the skatepark I learned to air out of the quarter pipe and I ollied a table (about 6-7 decks high) off a ramp. It surprised my brother and Kevin cuz I was getting so damn high. Yeah, it was fun but now my feet hurt. I'm gonna go rest.
