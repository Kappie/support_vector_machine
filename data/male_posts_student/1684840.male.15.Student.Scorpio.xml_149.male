Just been showing me mates the new layout and  Zak's Amazing Incredible Swearing Keyboard , which I made over the weekend; not for the ears of little children! (That includes you mum :P)  Anyway, I'll be going to cooking shortly (that's pronounced 'Cooh-King' in a Mrs. Humphries sort of way).  Checketts' lesson was quite strange.  She turned up late (as usual) and told us all off for 'behaving badly'.  Omg we're so naughty for being held up in our precious learning time... *cough*!  Quite ironic actually; this comes straight after the last lesson where I recall her telling Craig off for missing some of her lesson time... Hypocrite!
