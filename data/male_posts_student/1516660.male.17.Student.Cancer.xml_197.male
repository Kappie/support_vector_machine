I didn't go to school because I am too lazy to, and Mother don't want fever to come back today, so no school for moi.  I woke up at 8+. I bathed and then ate bread for breakfast. I went down to buy 8-Days to read. Meow! I read 8-Days till about 9+, then  read the newspaper. I discovered that Wednesdays have good shows to watch. For example, the repeat telecast of "Everybody Wins: Homerun Special", the new season of The District (yaY! I missed the show!) and tonight's Charmed.   After reading Straits Times, I went on to read "Bridal Bedlam", a Sabrina book. Then, I went online to check my mail and stuff. I read FAQs on FFIX, the Sims and this and that.  Mom went out at 11+ with Dad to go shoppping. It's a weekly thing. She always go shopping when it's her off-day as a cashier. I went offline at 12 to watch Everybody Wins.  For lunch, I ate two Sunshine Vanilla Bread. How meowful. After watching Everybody Wins, I went online again, to wait for The District to show. At 1.30, Mom and Dad came back. They brought two new computer chairs. Oh! They are so big.I am sitting in one of them right now. They got arm-rest one. So cool. It's a lil too big, cannot squeeze under the keyboard thingy...but cool!   At 2, I watched The District while parents went out to Sheng Shiong for grocery shopping. I missed good old Jack Mannion, Temple Page and so many more. Ahh!! How meowful is that!   After the wonderful episode of District, I played FFIX. Alright. FFIX updates. I managed to get all the Chocograpgh treasures, except for a crack in the Forgotten Contitnent and a bubble in the Quan's Dwelling. Sigh!! I don't even know where Quan's Dwelling is. And I tried to level up my cats by fighting Grand Dragon. But it's too strong for us! Sigh!  Then, CQ called. First, he gave me the good news. I won a prize for the GK quiz the Humanities Bioard held last term. But I wasn't there to recieve it! sigh! An opportunity wasted. I am gonna get it from Jalil tomorrow, I think. Then, he told me the bad news. I got B4 for E-Maths. No improvement there. Sigh!! No other papers have been given out. Tomorrow we are recieving our Chem and EL paper. I don't think I wanna get my EL paper back. Sigh!  After playiong FFIX, I went online again to chat with XC and WQ. At 6.30, I went out to eat.  After eating and walking around GValue, I came back, bathed and watched 15 mins of Holland V. And I came online. I think I am stopping now. Alright. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
