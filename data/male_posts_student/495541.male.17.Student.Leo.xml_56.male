I'm thinking that my feelings may be fabricated and infatuated by what I think I want rather than what I need.  It seems like no one cares much anymore about what they need only what they want.  I mean all that aside from their needs as humans.  I'm not sure what I'm saying.  It just seems to make sense at the moment.  Either that or I'm just not in a good mood.  I'm afraid that's the case.  I know moods have affects on decisions, thoughts, and everything in general associated with your mind and body.  It's the tricky game we play.  The scary part is you don't know.  You can easily prove this by just looking at anyone.  Look at people driving cars getting frustrated with anyone causing any type of inconvience to them.  I'm just saying this for example.  There's probably better ones, but that's all I can think of.  I think you get the idea.  It's late.  I need to study my play book and go to bed.  Night.
