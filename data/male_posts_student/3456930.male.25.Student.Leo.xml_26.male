The problem is that I'm not really getting enough work to save a decent amount before I go. I find new bills and expenses cropping up at the most inopportune time. When I think I'm finally starting to get ahead something comes along and puts me two steps back.  Example: Uni fees. $173. Textbooks. $200. Bloody house insurance. $133.  This just all in the last couple of weeks. Add on top of these the fact I still need to buy a backpacker's backpack (more convenient than a suticase) which will cost a good few hundred dollars (at least), $718 to go on my ticket, visa, and then save AT LEAST $2000. What with the exchange rate I'm gonna be lucky to get to the UK with 800 pounds.  Yes, I will be basically stepping into work but I will still need to pay for bond and shit when I get there. There may be a few weeks where I won't be working...  Hell, I'll admit it, even my impulsive, devil-may-care side of me is getting worried! And that's enough to get the rational side of me really freaking out!  What the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm not getting enough hours at work and I don't know if getting a second job is achievable or will achieve much. The other frustrating thing is that I live with sociable people who like to go out and do stuff like go to the movies, go drinking yadda yadda yadda. I don't want to seem like a social introvert so I tend to go along as well. I really need to stop doing that. I also need to buy groceries and not get take away so often (tends to happen when you work nights though).  Hell, I need to completely overhaul my entire budget. I need to overhaul my entire way of thinking...   Lowman X, out.   "Here's a quick impression for you: Caw caw! BANG!! Fuck! I'm dead!" -Big Top. 'The Crow'
