This was the one that caused me to wait two and a half hours for another by the same artist, that plus she was freaking hilarious. We were just siting there and she asked us what we wanted. Just then i glanced over at Erin and she was wearing cat ears so i impulsively said "give her a tail!" and so she did. I still love this picture, we're so happy in it. urlLink
