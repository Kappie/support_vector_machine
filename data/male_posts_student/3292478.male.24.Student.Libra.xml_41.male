Poor me. Put the stuff anywhere near me or my bank account and I become hysterical, resorting to spending it like a crazy fool in all good record stores.   The result? 700 CD's. No money!  This usually means that, each month, I take on the Mission Impossible of getting my rent in on time (rumour has it that Tom Cruise is basing the new MI3 film on me). This month I managed it, albeit 3 weeks late, and sat smugly knowing that another month could pass before the crazy charade continued.  However, dear folks, upon checking my balance I saw that TWO rent cheques had gone out of my account. One of these had the terrible misfortune of bouncing.  Today I have spent the morning attempting to find out where this extra cheque came from. The cheque, as far as I can work out, was written in December 2003. But the letting agency have no recollection of it, claim I am otherwise up-to-date with my rent, and reckon they only cashed one cheque!  I am truly baffled. The bank are getting a copy of the cheque so we can see who paid it in, the problem being that the cheque that bounced was the one the letting agency know they paid in.  So I am currently one month in arrears in the eyes of the letting agency. And one months rent money out of pocket but I don't know to who!!!   Anyway, the lovely ladies at the bank are 'on the case' and I've promised them that, should they solve this Agatha Christie-esque tale of murder and intrigue, I will buy them each a rose and serenade them in the bank!!  Updates as and when I hear anything!
