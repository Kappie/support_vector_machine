Okay, before a new season starts I try to pick who will end up winning. Me, I always pick the person who gets two inches from winning! I'm like god damn Phil Mickelson! I was going to chose Lex, but I felt like I should pick Jenna. Jenna was good because she didn’t impress anyone too much, win any immunities, or hold any grudges.   First Hour:  Big Tom goes out, owch! Three words; DON’T TRUST ROB! C’mon man! Sad enough, the goat-farmer got stuck in Rob’s trap!   Rupert’s next to go! Jenna turns on him which was a GOOD MOVE! If anyone, I mean ANYONE, got to the final two with Rupert, duh! He’d win! Even though Jenna’s decision was kinda harsh, it was smart!	  Now, the two dudes you wouldn’t wanna piss off (Tom and Rupert) are in the jury PISSED!   Second Hour:  Final three: Jenna, Amber, and Boston Rob. Of course, the final challenge is one of those “be in an uncomfortable position-stand there forever-hot as fucking hell . . . ” You get it. Of course, to make this challenge more of a pain in the ass, it was something like 110 degrees! Okay, Jenna’s the first to wimp out, well, she just made a sad mistake. See, you have to hold on this post and stand on two posts with your feet. If anything comes off, you’re out! Jenna took one of her feet off the post and ended up costing her a million bucks! And then Rob won. Whoopdee-fucking-doo! Oh well.  Tribal Council, of course, Rob picked Amber to go to the final two with him leaving Jenna in the jury. It was like the movie Titanic (don’t ask why); you know the ships gonna sink! It was the same with this! Alright, once again, my pick is SO close, but not close enough. Story of my life.  Now that the final two are chosen, you gotta sit through a 45 minute .”devotion to people you voted off” thing. I mean, you think they’re gonna say, “Oh, I miss this person, they were a good player . . . ” No way! They should be saying, “This person’s a lying piece of shit, no good, crappy player . . . ” I mean, YOU VOTED THE LOSER OFF! Oh well!   Okay, now the votes! Here’s the part where people get to speak their mind and say “fuck you” with a straight face. Best part of this was Big Tom! First he opens up by saying to Rob and Amber “I’m a goat-farmer, so if I see a goat chasin’ little-old ladies, I CASTRATE THEM!” Already I’m pissing myself from laughing! And at the end he goes “ . . . Anyways, no hard feelings . . . ” and walks up to Rob to shake hands, but pulls it away and says, “ . . . Don’t be stupid, stupid!” That was PRICELESS!!! Oh, and I love how Jerri wanted to speak, but everyone booed her! HAHA! And after the break the host said that she left because of the rude crowd. How sad, ***cough**cough***.   The votes! Okay, but first; the twist! Okay, too fucking obvious! Rob ended up proposing to Amber, and she said "yes." At this point I HATE THIS SHOW! HAHA! JENNA LOOSES! ROB AND AMBER IN FINAL TWO! THEY GET MARRIED! AHHH!!! (haha!) Anyways, I had a good feeling Rob would win because, he’s played good! He’s a smart player! You gotta admit!  He is!  But, Amber won buy like 1 votes. Who cares, he’s gonna get the money anyways!        Okay, now for the "surprise ending" as they called it. At this point, I've sat through 3 hours of Survivor, okay, I enjoyed it, but, okay. After the commercial after the winner gets picked, there's this surprise. As it turned out, you can go online and choose who you want to receive an extra million bucks to give away to any Survivor All Star. I'm thinking "this sucks, man!" Oh well, it was still cool. I mean, c'mon, who do YOU thinks gonna win?! RUPERT! Even I'd vote for him, but I hope that doesn't sound harsh, I do like the guy! He's a great player! Anyways, that's that.   This was a good finally. We have a Survivor couple and plenty of people finding love, even Hatch! WOW! HAHA! Okay, this was a great finally, I can't wait until next season. I'll keep y'all posted then.  Sorry for all these delays because I moved, which I'll write about. I'll keep you posted.   Words of Wisdom from Big Tom: "Don't be stupid, stupid!"
