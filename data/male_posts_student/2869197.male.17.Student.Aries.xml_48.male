Hunting would be an utopic action for me if I could aim worth a rat's reproductive organ. I just hate sports hunting. You shoot something...then you don't eat it...WTF!?! You loser! That's like bulldozing an orphanage because you enjoy seeing things being destroyed.  Went to Barnes and Noble on a date. I just realized, B has been getting a lot of mention in these posts...meh. I think it went well, except I went to the bathroom twice because of the frappe. I showed her my favorite book areas and she showed me hers. She likes nonfiction and I like science fiction. Wow, we're going to kill each other or something. Nah, I enjoy a good nonfiction every once in a while. Heck, I have a whole series of nonfiction called "Dear Diary" in which olden people have written their thoughts which made it through the ages into this quaint little diary of now. I got over that after I realized how gay it is to read 15th century women's diaries. All good literature dies when you realize it makes you look like a homosexual.
