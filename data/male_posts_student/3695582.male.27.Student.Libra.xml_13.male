There's really not much I could say about it that hasn't already been said somewhere, but I learned a bit from it (even if Moore is cribbing from stuff that Greg Palast has been doing for years) and was entertained as well, even if I'm not much for watching Saudis get their heads chopped off or Iraqis and American soldiers blown to pieces.  It's certainly not a cinematic masterwork nor wholly cohesive in its attacks on the administration, as articles  urlLink like this  point out.  But all in all, F-911 is nothing if not a patriotic film in the way I understand patriotism.  I'll go and see it again sometime soon - especially since the longer we all manage to keep it selling out screenings (even on weekday nights in college towns on summer break!), the better the chances that people like my parents - good, decent people without too political leanings, but all too prone to supping up whatever the 7 o' clock news tells them, I'm afraid - will get around to seeing it.  Not that voters in Connecticut are going to decide this election in the end - God help us if it comes to that.  Hosted  urlLink Afternoon Edition  yesterday, and doing it again today, so tune in for it, dammit.   urlLink Marlon Brando's dead , and it's just a bit weird how it took a day - and a couple sketchy, unconfirmed reports - before the news hit for real.    I'm far too tired, too uninspired, and sitting at much too uncomfortable a computer set-up (imagine the monitor 4 feet away from me at an oblique angle, my neck craned painfully to 3 o'clock while I type at a keyboard at my knees - can you say ergonomic atrocity?) to write any more here now.  Maybe later.
