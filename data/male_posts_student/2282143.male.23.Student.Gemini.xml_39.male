First off, I am outdoors again and even though it is still a bit chilly, I love it.  Makes me happy.  Also makes me happy cause I totally love my bosses.  Food service is short handed so instead of hiring some dumb teen at 5.50 and hour, they will pay me what I make to do it for them.  In other words tomorrow I will be cleaning up as an extra hand for the food service.  Oh well.  I get to leave to go get my uncle from the airport as early as I need to and they cant to jack about what I can and cant do because they aren't my department.  We are helping them after all, so they are at our mercy.  Is life sweet or what?    I just really have one gripe lately besides being slightly bored with life right now.  Even Sam says I am boring.  How sad is that when the one you love tells you that you live a lame existence?  Although I did go out last night with the boys, which rocked because I just haven't went out for a while.  Unfortunately couldn't get shitty cause I had to work at 9 this morning.  Have a party tonight too, yet cant get shitty cause I have to work.  So yeah, I guess that still makes me lame.  Although Pop was very impressed because he says it was funny how he just called me and I was there no questions asked.  Hey, like I said, I live a boring life.  Wow... Digression...  Ok, so my gripe.  Anyone hear how they are giving away a $6000 HDTV to all of those celebs that attend the Oscars tomorrow?  How messed up is that?  A $46,000 gift basket for attending a 5 hour event on a night when you would probably be sitting on your butt doing nothing at all.  They already make millions a year for pretending to be someone else.  I just don't get it.  Cant you take that money and do something else with it?  SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE?  Lets see... How many people are going to be receiving this basket.  Lets say 100 (which there will most likely be a lot more).  Do you know what a charity could do with FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS?  Shit, we could rebuild Iraq... Four and a half million dollars would build hundreds of homes for the homeless.  It could provide for the needy and starving of this country and possibly pull a third world country out of IMF debt.  Heck, it could be a start to clearing our own national debt (thanks Dubya).  It could single handedly save an endangered species!  Ok, I don't really know these things because I don't know a darn thing about how NPO's work or their costs or anything like that, but that's not my point.  The point is, this is an absolute waste of money going to people who already make too much.  I think what I'm trying to say is that this society has its heads up their asses, backwards.  I really don't get why we pay athletes, musicians, and actors millions of dollars to do what they do.  We pay them to entertain us.  We don't pay those who educate our children:  Teachers get shit on, and we wonder why our children are so stupid.  Pay a teacher what they deserve, and watch how they start putting effort in teaching.  We don't pay those who save our lives:  We complain about rising health care cost, but screw doctors with insurance and litigation, making them as blue collar as the next guy.  We don't pay those who protect us:  We pay too much to start fights with other countries, yet police and fire personnel suffer.  Once again like the teachers, pay them what they are worth, and you will see quality results.  We don't pay those who make our lives better:  as a CNA, I do what other people will not so that a person can die with their dignity as I strive to make their last moments in this life as peaceful and pleasant as possible, yet I would be financially better off working in a McDonald's.  We do not pay those who would benefit most.  And by this, I mean scientists making medical breakthroughs, those who spend their lives dedicated to finding cures to the epidemics of our time.  Throw that extra four million their way and see what results.  We do not pay for things that we need, yet we pay for entertainment.  I feel like this is how the Roman Empire was, with the gladiators and all.  We only care about our own pleasure and not what is important.  We want entertainment and others will suffer because of this decision.  I think I am becoming too wise in my old age... hehehe.  I think I agree more and more with my little brother every day.  Corruption, lies, greed, and all this negativity fills our society.  I'm growing tired of all this media running our lives, telling us what is right and what is wrong.  I talked with master Muhammed on Thursday night and he was actually making sense to me.  He was born in Iran and came over here many many years ago, but he had something to say on the culture differences.  He was telling me about how the whole Palestinian suicide bomber works.  He told me that in their culture, family is the most important thing, and if someone messes with your family, you must take their lives, or your own.  Some when they feel they have nothing left, they choose both, hence the beginning of all that suicide bombing nonsense.  But it is just their culture.  That is how they live.  Who are we to judge their culture?  I think if we start to understand these cultures, then we realize that you must step back and avoid conflicts that would cause this type of reaction.  I dunno.  I think I'm done ranting.  I've moved on from being bored with life to flat out hating it right now.   Oh yeah, and I say screw the celebrities and give the gifts to the seat fillers...  At least they would appreciate it.
