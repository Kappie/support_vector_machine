You can't buy a door like it anymore, though one day, imaginably, it will need to be replaced considering that it is constantly exposed to the elements. Any "modern" door will look out of place within the outside facade of the house. In terms of craftmanship, there is nothing exceptional about the door, it is not difficult to build. Regardless, doors are not built like it anymore. And while a carpenter could be contracted to fashion a copy, the cost would be prohibitive to the majority of home owners.   Business idea: speciality, "old-school" door manufacturer. Limited mass-production of a dozen or so models would keep the price of new "old" doors down while at the same time offer a fair facsimile to the original designs. As well as the aesthetic function of replacing the rotting, dated doors, providing modern insulation with a classic design would be another selling point. The most difficult part would be distribution, convincing hardware stores to sell the product. Perhaps it could start as a catalogue item.  Why do thoughts like this pass through my head? Who the fuck cares??? Apparently I do. Thoughts like this one pass through my head all the time.
