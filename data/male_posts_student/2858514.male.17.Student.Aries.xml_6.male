I have decided to write my posts in English as my English typing speed faster than that of Chinese and I can train my English during writting.  Graduation dinner is coming soon. This is probably the last chance for F.5 classmates to play together. I'll treasure this chance anyway, since I may not see them in the next school year.  I've had a talk with Aries through ICQ. He told me that it's better to take some posts in F.6. I understand his point but I really know too few people and I'm introvertive, so teachers won't find me to take posts of the clubs. Besides, I would not be able to do the job well if I had a post! But still, I'll try my best!  Many days had passed since the end of the CE, but I haven't done anything meaningful. I just sit in front of the computer for a whole day. Yeah, it's a waste of time, so I'd better find something else to do as soon as possible...
