So, now he has taken the Ford to his workplace in Chandigarh. Let me get back to the subject now. As i was saying he plans to buy a new car My Mum says we should buy a Corolla but somehow i dont like that car. Anyways, my dad took a test drive of the Corolla on Friday. My Review The car is Ok. But if you compare it with Ford its nothing except for the little itsy-bitsy cosmetic stuff  The Ford has a 1.6 litre, 8-valve SOHC, 91 bhp engine whereas the Corolla claims to have a 1.8 litre, 16-valve, 125 bhp engine but it doesnt look like the car just refuses to accelerate. i mean 0- 100 in 8 secs..nuthin gr8 the ford accelerates like hell man...its got so much power underneath its hood  Braking of corolla is awful...nothing as compared to Ford  Also my dad didnt like the driving comfort of the car  Other Options Octavia(nobody in the house is interested) CR-V(daddy says its expensive) Endeavour(i feel its underpowered) Mondeo(daddy doesnt like it) Mercedes-Benz A Class(not available in india) rest of the cars are above budget but might jus slip in  My Best Option to buy a tractor and go do farming in our farms OR this is the best part  Buy a big truck...send it to a body builder...get it modified at the back...u know, carrier air-con, Bose surround sound, TV, Sofa cum Bed...all the gr8 shit at the back of the truck we'll put a sign that says OK TATA HORN PLEASE  Buri nazar wale tera muh kala  we'll also hang the Nokia 1100 in front and then say Raat ko bhi chalta hai this is about it  about the vacation part i went to chandigarh and ambersar(amritsar)..nuthin much to rite abt that  gtg ciao
