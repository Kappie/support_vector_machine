Yesterday I saw the greatest movie EVER!!!!!. Not Star Wars or Manos: Hands of  Fate . . . Wait, Manos: Hands of Fate was pure 100% crap. Okay, the greatest movie I’ve ever seen was Scarface. Thankfully I was able to borrow it. Lemme give you two words to sum up how awesome it was: FRIGGIN’ AWESOME!!!!! It was great! I couldn’t believe how truly amazing it was.  The movie’s basically about a criminal from Cuba who comes to America and ends up selling cocaine and kills so guys here and there. You may be asking what you’d expect from a movie like this. I tell you. 2 hours and 35 minutes of killing, cocaine, and a Cuban guy who probably says "fuck" a thousand times. My kind of movie.   Al Pachino was great! He was "The One" to play this role. I mean, his character, Tony Montana  is a total sociopath.  He’ll kill anyone for anything. And Al Pachino had some of the greatest line’s and insults in the movie like,  "Fuck you!,   "Cockaroaches,"  and  "Wasp-Whore."  Who comes up with that stuff? The guy’s insane! I mean, if anyone screws with him he will just kill them. That just goes to show you; be careful who you screw with because they  may just pull out an AK 47 and gun you down sucka!     Why I’m gonna cover the music is beyond me. Okay, the music was real good! It was all 80s music. Just cuz I’m a rock ‘n roll freak doesn’t mean I don’t like 80s music. In fact, if you’ve ever played Grand Theft Auto 3, you may have noticed that the songs played on Flashback FM are all featured in Scarface. Most of those songs are played in the dace-club. All and all, I thought the music was sweet!  Okay, for the movie Scarface, I gotta give it *****! I highly recommend you go out and rent or even buy it. You’ll love it! But, as a heads up, it will take you probably a half an hour to adjust to Tony Monatan’s Cuban accent. Okay, I’m getting so excited that I’m gonna watch it again! Good night world.
