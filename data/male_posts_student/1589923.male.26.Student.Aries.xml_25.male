Sigh...how i wish things didn't turn out this way but i know it's beyond my grasp and control. Nature took its course and things took a life of its own. what can i say? it's not exactly what i expect but then again, you can't have the best of both worlds. one hand, i am glad that puzzle seems to make more sense....but on the other hand, it doesn't necessarily makes me feel better or at ease. i really hate this feeling and i wish it will go away but somehow it doesn't. It's sticking onto me like a leeching, sucking every inch of life in me. Maybe i should just fuck it all and hope for the best? nah....i know i won't feel totally happy at all. sigh. or have i reach a stage where i can't bear to give it all up and i just want to posssess them, all for myself. seems rather selfish huh? oh well, all humans are selfish by nature. Every man for himself. it's only how much of a degree they are that makes the difference.   i guess when u have a gf that gets along so damn well with all guys, u really can't help but feel this way eh.
