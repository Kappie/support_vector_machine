Up springs his buildings, his dams, his bridges. Not enough though, to save him, buried in a landslide. 100 days, New Deal, a turn around, blowing away some dust. Foreign attacks, battles, murder, camps. Britain, France, USSR. Germany Italy, Japan. Civil war just to their south, with depression in the west. Silent we stay, away from problems because of our own already. And so we struggle to maintain life, here in the 1930s, in the US.  ~Brian H.
