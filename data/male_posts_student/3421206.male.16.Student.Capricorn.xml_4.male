Its a sure 12 hour drive from where I live to Myrtle Beach. But its ok. We have a tv in the van we are riding in. Me and Aaron, my grandfather and his wife are riding in the van. There is a tv, we can hook up an N64, and there is enough room to jam with both of our acoustics. We are gettin some songs ready to play on the streets of Myrtle Beach. Hopefully we will make some money playin. Enough money for me to spend on stuff down there. Im currently poor. So this might be a good thing. Anyways...we have a bunch of romantic songs lined up to play. That will be fun. We never have ev er really played any slow songs. So this could be a new experience for us. Hopefully it will. Well Ima get goin. You people have a good day! Cyaz!
