'Computing Mathematics 1 IT1501'  !!!  shocking, one might say... but i've emailed her abt the error.. not sure whether she had seen it or not...  felt the full 'force' of the sunburn i've kanna yesterday... but lucky it's only on my shoulders... not such big deal except when i'm bending down or lying down...  i think i'll go haf my dinner now...  later...
