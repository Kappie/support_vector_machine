My Sarah came over at noon and then we left for the Flower Festival around 12:30. We walked around and walked around until 4 pm, when we came home. Sarah and I watched Detroit Rock City, Almost Famous, and Road to Perdition. After that we watched Zoolander on TBS and then we watched a documentary on sex during the Civil War. She just left, so it has indeed been a long, full day of Sarah. Many more of those are needed. That is all now. Goodbye.
