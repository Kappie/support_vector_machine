After school Piggy J and Tyke came back to Tyke's pad for a little and chilled and then came back to the school for the baseball game.  Skippy came down and joined Purdy, Tina, Tig Ol, Piggy J, and Tyke.  Then Karla came down later and she watched too as well as Amed.  After the game the gang had to keep Purdy out because of her surprise birthday party at her house.  So they all went up to Tyke's and watched some videos and Tyke and Skippy gave Purdy her presents from them.  She did seem to like them so that is good.  After Purdy and Tig left the guys had to quickly head on down to Purdy's house to wait for the surprise.  It was a really fun party.  It makes it so much better since Tyke knows everyone there.  He didn't use to and that made it somewhat awkward.  But now it is just fun.  Tyke talked with a lot of people and played some DDR with Macaroon.  Tyke and Tina hung out for a while.  And Haras.  Tyke and Haras finally got to hang out some more.  Since they hardly ever hang out now it seems.  Which is sad because they are such good friends.  But this is just the beginning.  It will keep on escalating from this point forward.  But tonight was really fun and Tyke really hopes that Purdy had a really great time and that she isn't too stressed about anything.  Oh, and the walk to Tyke's car wasn't fun.  But that's no biggy.  One more thing.  Tyke took on Kram in ping-ping at the party.  Damn, damn, damn.  Tyke went up quickly 11-3 and was just showcasing all his talents but somehow he just started to have too many unforced errors.  When all was said and done, Kram won 21-19.  Tyke really wanted to win that game.  Yeah, really.  Damn.  But yeah, nights like this have a feel to them.  This night is no different.  Goodnight.
