My alarm didn't go off, and I woke up late, and on top of that I didn't get toeat anything. At school  didn't finish my Functions homework, so the teacher was being a douche about that, and in Homeroom, I found out that everyone failed the summer reading tests. Second block wasn't so bad, I did a test then went to the library and drew baaad pictures of the Banshee vehicle from Halo. Afterwards, the day picked up a little when the girl mentioned in the last post started a convo with me ( :-D ). We did some stupid thing matching literary terms to stories or something like that. It was stupid and boring, so I talked to Monochrome for the whole period :). By History, there was about 12 people in the class, so we just hung out mainly. Monochrome and I talked to the girls the are at the next table over, Darcie and Chelsea. Allison is also around and we talk to her too. Darcie is nice, she's tall with dark hair. We have an ongoing joke that she is a stripper becasue when we are bored in History, we draw pictures of pretty much random stuff and have the random stuff fight between them. I was brought into one of these battles by Monochrome, and Darcie drew a stripper who "Distracted Jake." In the end of this paper conflict, Darcie wrote "She wins," to which Monochrome wrote "Who? The stripper or Darcie?" and Darcie wrote: The stripper, 'cuz it's Darcie." I guess you had to be there. Moving on, Chelsea is short and a little over-obsessed with her pet donkey. Note: This Chelsea is not to be confused with my slutty ex-girlfriend Chelsea who just happens to be short as well. She's cool though. Oh ya, if you didn't catch that part, from  urlLink his blog  Monochrome is like in love with her (lol). Nevertheless, she's a nice person. Allison is...well...Republican to the max. She is obsessed with George Bush in a scary way. She has some strange theories about what the world should be and why it should be like that. One of these theories is that some people just don't deserve rights. She flat-out said this on the second day of our discussion of  women's rights . Now, why would a woman say these things about women's rights? Seriously, how can someone like that who thinks that anyone who is a Democrat should be lynched say that people shouldn't get equal rights? I'm not sure and I probably will never know either. Oh, ya...I came to a startling conclusion today. Fat girls shouldn't be allowed to wear thongs and short skirts, especially if they are planning on standing near a stairwell. I was walking up to History class today and I determined this by experiencing it, which made Darcie, Chelsea, and Allison laugh hysterically when I said that to them. They're evil to the max. After school let out, I went down to get my birth certificate back from the Driver's Education instructor. I had to wait like twenty minutes and I missed my ride which I wasn't too happy about. I got a ride from my friend Mike, though and here I am, telling you about the amazing day I've had and such. In a couple of weeks, I may be going to MIT for a program called ESP Splash, which sounds really cool. The deal is, you go to MIT for two days to attend 16 hours of seminars on various things. It cheap, too...like $30 to do the whole thing. Though it doesn't give you any college credits, it  does  make you look really good to colleges that you apply to, which is ?ber cool (like the umlov'd U?).  I think that's about all for now, I'll try to update again soon.  --Raine
