It says that it can be used as a bubble bath, body wash, AND shampoo. Now, I'm no chemist, but I can't imagine why for all these years they'd use separate sets of chemicals for each job when they could have used one set for all the jobs. Well, ya know it is with that technology and stuff and how it goes so quickly. But even then, they still have different sets of chemicals for each job. There must be like 5 jillion shampoos and conditioners alone, not to mention the googolplexes of body washes and bubble baths that are on the market. At least the all-in-one things smell ok. They smell kinda like candy, jelly beans in particular. One's called "Coconut" and the other's called "Marine". The writing on the bottle's also kinda amusing, it's got some common phrases, but they stick the flavor of the all-in-one in place of a word. I forget how it goes, but a couple of the lines were "A Marine to end all Marines" and "The Coconut that ate the big apple".  I imagine it's been there for a couple days or a week... or so, which is about the time we went to Target. I usually find something new around the house after my mother and sister go there. It takes me a while to notice things in the shower though because I'm usually walking in more asleep than awake and most of the process happens with my eyes closed and me ready to fall over. Hehe, I imagine I look pretty funny in there; grabbing at the plastic bottles of shampoo, body wash, and facial cleansers like a blind man. Giggles. That is all.         -- Feanor
