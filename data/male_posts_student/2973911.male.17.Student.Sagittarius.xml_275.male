Maybe it is meant to be open-ended because we have no real definition.  People can use it carnally, romantically, or platonically.  That's just the worst word in the dictionary.  But if we remove it for its ambiguous definition, we must remove a lot of other words as well.  What to do?  Define it first before using.  But that quite suck.  "Hi, love for me is (please enter personal definition here).  Now, I want to tell you that I love you."    Then, it all returns to that stupid guy there.
