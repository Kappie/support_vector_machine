It's the last year I'm gonna stay at this school, I had join this band since form 3, I'm the percussion leader since last year, so today is the deadline of my job. Because I really miss my post, so I felt some sad to give out my jobs. But, still I'm happy to see my junior who are going to replace my post.    We taking picture in the morning, for our memory. The meeting start with our conductor Mr. Woon, and ended by our former president. Two leader are chosen for our section, because percussion section seems to be hard to maintain. I hope my junior are doing well soon.    We have lunch all together on restaurant... After that, I back to school band room again, and play the drum alone...
