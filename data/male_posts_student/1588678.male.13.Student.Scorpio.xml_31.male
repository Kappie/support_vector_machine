I loved the show Jackass, so when I herd that Bam Margera was gonna have his own show I knew I’d love it. That guy drives his parents nuts, which adds some of the funniness in the show.   So far I’ve seen two episodes. I saw the “Don’t Feed Phil Day” episode and I saw “The Family Reunion” episode last night. The Don’t Feed Phil Day episode was so funny! The deal is that Bam’s 400 lb. Dad can’t eat anything except for a glass of hot water for 24 hours. He starts out by weighing his dad. The second he steps on the scale it says “error.” I mean, the guy’s so fat that the scale says error. How funny is that?! Then later that day Bam’s dad went to an eating festival. Bam followed him. In one hour Bam’s dad ate hotdogs, hamburgers, pasta, pizza, and sandwiches. Then the next day at 12 am, Bam woke his dad up to tell him that Don’t Feed Phil Day had officially started. Bam, who plans ahead, thought his dad may try to go out and get something to eat, so Bam posted signs in every restaurant, bar, and grocery store in town that said, “Don’t Feed Phil Day ” along with a picture of Phil on it, and boy they sure as hell worked. He even had street signs and bumper stickers that said “Don’t Feed Phil Day,” and an airplane flew over the town with the words Don’t Feed Phil Day on it. I felt bad for Phil cause he went in to bars and restaurants trying to order food, but people who worked at those restaurants pointed at Don’t Feed Phil Day signs in their restaurants. Near the end of the day, Bam went to a rock concert. When he left, Phil’s brother, the famous, Don Vito came over and attempted to order a pizza while Bam was gone. Thanks to Phil’s wife, April, she called Bam to tell him what was going on. Bam was mad, so he came home, along with hundreds of people from the concert and the band with him. They came in time. They decided to finish the concert at Bam’s parent’s house. In the end Phil didn’t eat for 24 hours, so they celebrated by blind-folding Phil and feeding him sandwiches with candy and chips and all sorts of crap in it. Then in the end Don Vito showed off his toe-nail that had broken off but was still hanging by a thread. Uhhh, it was gross! They pulled it off with pliers and decided to smell it. At one point after Ryan Dunn (cast member of Jackass) smelled the toe and vomited by the sinister smell. It was so funny!   The Family Reunion episode was the best of the two. Oh god it was so friggin funny!!! Bam has a friend who calls himself Compton Ass Terry. He great! Compton Ass Terry and Bam decided to get Phil some bling-bling. Back to the reunion. What can I say about Bam’s family? Well, everyone in the family is 400 lbs. Apparently everyone on Bam’s father’s side of the family grew up in a town where there was pollution and that sort of crap, so Bam feels it really screwed up that side of the family. In fact, one of Bam’s uncles just got out of jail and went straight to the family reunion. In fact he was still wearing his orange jail uniform. Anyways, Bam decided to do something special for this “special occasion,” so he decided to make his house look like a medieval-time’s castle. He made a draw-bridge and everything. He even had an elephant at the house. Okay, the food, he got meat, meat, and more meat! He even got a whole pig! At one point during the dinner, Don Vito ate the pig’s eye, downed 2 beers, then ate a lit cigarette! He is amazing!!! After that happened one of Bam’s grandmothers decided to leave. She was furious! She proceeded to yell, “This family’s crazy,” and Bam, with his devilish smile answered, “Yes, we are.” This is where in got real funny, Bam got a letter from the Home Owners Association giving them a $500 fine for having an elephant in their front yard. Bam read out loud some of the letter and it said, “. . . You are receiving a $500 fine because an elephant was reported in your front yard . . .” Along with that, Bam got a thank you letter from his neighbors thanking them for letting the neighbors kids play with the elephant. Oh god it was hilarious!!! That sure was a family reunion to remember.
