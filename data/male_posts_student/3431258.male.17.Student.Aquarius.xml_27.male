I also never understanded why there was 2 versions of it released on the same system with different names, one named The Ninjawarriors and another named  The Ninjawarriors Again . After reading a bit on the subject, it seems there was a  amiga  game named The Ninjawarriors, so the snes version is simply a remake. I hope i get the chance of playing the amiga version, it looks really cool.   Downloaded  America's Army  ( a file of 745mo). It's nice ,but it does'nt really have that special feeling i was expecting out of it. I simply uninstalled, i believe  Counter-Strike  (even if boring as hell) as a little more originality to it.   Had a argue with my parents about study and stuff. I will study at least 1 hour each day, i have to do it, even tought i really don't have the will for it.   I spoke a bit with  Renata Gazini  ( Ana Eliza 's friend!). She would like to have the photos we took on  Helder 's camera, and as well chat on  msn . I gave her my  Google  mail and my msn, altought she did not log on today (guess she only enter on weekends like all the rest here).   Oh well, i'm tired and i have nothing special to do, so better go sleeping early!  Regards,  Zephyr
