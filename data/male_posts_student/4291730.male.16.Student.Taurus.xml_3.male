More specifically, I've been working my way though the PC version of Halo and am currently up to Keys but can't kill all the Flood I find when I drop into the coolant pools. I also did The Maw on the Xbox version again (on Normal instead of being a wuss and choosing easy like last time) which I stuffed up once or twice before I managed to finish it with plenty of time remaining to run to the Longsword and escape. On the subject of ilovebees i've been looking at the screwed-up images in wordpad and collecting the words and parts of sentences hidden in there. Someone has probably already done this but it gave me something to do.  On a Halo-unrelated subject, pretty much finished the  urlLink Dimewest  website. Just need the content for the Case Studies page.  Still waiting for a delivery from Forbidden Planet, though it's only been two days and it can take up to twenty-eight. Hopefully i'll be receiving a Grunt (of Halo fame) figure, a Drop Ship (of Aliens fame) model, a poster by Giger and a remote control Yoshi car (of Nintendo fame, in a car) for my sister.  One other thing, got a trailer for the new GTA game today and it basically sucks.  The trailer shows nothing happening of interest, just some people walking/driving around really.  Not like i'd buy it anyway mind. Also got the Halo 2 cinema trailer, there's at least a bit of action in there but its a poor trailer. Luckily, there's other much better videos around that encouraged me to pre-order.
