Why home study?  * Regular public school is still expensive for some families that need to buy supplies, transportation, and food for the kids who are attending school.  * Relatively no supplies (just a work book) so costs are minimal.  * Parents as well as children work in some families so there's no time for children to attend traditional schooling.    Suggestion by the kids:  * Review more often to go over questions and answers in the work book.  * Have optional times for reviews so the students can maximize their review sessions.  * Most problems are with science and english with less concern in math and reading.    The modules are handed to the kids. The kids fill out the modules and the modules are sent to Angelican college for grading. If the kids pass the module, they can take a test to rise to the next grade level.
