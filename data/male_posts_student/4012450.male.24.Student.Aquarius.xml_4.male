I attended a party few weeks ago. Since that,some people who were at that party ask me "Are you OK?" Actualy,I drunk too much,and I was dunkard. YOPPARAI! A man told me I hit him by the umbrella stand and put it on my head... But I don't remember it. I know I sometimes go crazy by drinking. I just wanted to know what I had done.  So,I asked another woman about it. When she told me that pharase I said. "Why do you say that? What did I do?" By the way,is it a polite question? I am not nateve. So I don't know if the pharase could hurt person. Can it do? It maight?  English is difficult for me!Or communication is more difficult!MUZUKASII Is my favorite place my room?
