From being a loser kid and a nerd, he has became a real motherfucker hehe, and i like that, he's cool and umm here's a pic of him, he's not that cute now lol, but yea he's really cool:    he looks better with his glasses but o well he's crazy. Anyways, like a hour ago, ym mom and i were talkin cuz she founf out i was drinking and that i smoke... she said she doesnt want me to drink when im alone, and that she understands i wanna try out stuff but that i should do it with her permission, that she wont be mad or anything, she understands it and also she just gave me permission to smoke but she told me not to do it too often or too much, but if i do it, she said i should do it here, in my home and not in the streets like hiding from her or anything, she said i should trust her and that i should not drink cuz its badder than smoking. Its kool, now i dont have to hide anymore when im smokin, cuz she is lettin me do it, of course, always inside my house cuz it suks to smoke in the streets and u look shitty. Its kool. But okay, the topic of this message was to tell you that im goin to a trip tomorrow and i wont be on until monday, when i come back. So see ya later, have fun and miss me while im not here Mwahahaha lol. Bye Bye!   "Get it stuck up your ass motherfucking son of a bitch!" HaHa BiAtCh!!
