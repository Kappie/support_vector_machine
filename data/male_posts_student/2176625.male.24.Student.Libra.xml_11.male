She was sent by the family because the whole time she has been here I've heard "Leslie this, Leslie that"  Corey and his fiancee will be in Sac the same time I will be there, we're already planning a club night or bar night. I have not seen him since he left for England a year ago, we used to go bar hoping with our women every weekend back then. I'm looking forward to it but I'm looking forward to seeing a special lady just as much. If she doesn't back out.   I'll belong to you if you just let me through
