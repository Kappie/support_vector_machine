He was going to almost create a new program or edit an existing web browser to do this. Since he was so nice to help me fix my computer yesterday, I went to work on the Kiosk browser problem after I did my homework today. I downloaded the browser K-Meleon (freeware) which uses the same engine as Mozilla Firefox (freeware also), and proceeded to read all there was to read on configuring and customizing K-Meleon. After a couple of hours, and some frustrating trial and error, I got it. Now when Paul comes in tomorrow, I can show him how I did it and how it works so we can setup the final product on the real computer that will be eventually located in Portland somewhere on the street so homeless people can point and click on the web sites we give the access to (government stuff, info on jobs/shelters, stuff like that) and they wont need to type anything because we will remove the keyboard. It will be smooth as butter. Best of all, its free.    In other news, I will have to draw my art project on Monday because I just cant draw here...period. I think I will setup a collage of interesting items in my room, then sit in my chair for a dew hours listening to Pink Floyd while I draw. I will use the techniques the teacher wants us teach  so it will be a little different than I am used to, but hey that's the point of me taking this class in the first place. If I just drew everything the same way as I do now, then I can't expand as an artist.   1 hour until closing time! Yippie. I talked with Barbara today. I met her sister Kelley. She seems nice and I look forward to hanging out at Barbara's and meeting her. No one really here today in the computer room. Quite...too quite.    My thoughts wander over to my room and my new PC sitting there waiting for me to put some new hardware in her. Her name is Seatec Astronomy. She is great. I envision us having a great human computer experience for a few years to come. Eventually, and money permitting, I will drop in 2 GB of mind warping RAM. Speed and power that will be unrivaled by anyone for awhile, at least anyone I know.     I was researching my web idea some more and found a similar (just one aspect) site and web author. I think I am on the right track if just one aspect of my idea is working for someone and they are making money, not a lot, but its a start. I think I will eventually ask some people if they want to become partners with me to start up my idea.
