But what I'm really puzzled was when did Professor Adrian Hall a paleoclimatologist (a scientist who studies the ways weather patterns changed in the past), ever told his son Sam to hide when the eye of the storm is over them?? Usually I don't mind anyone talking to me during a movie, but Kah Loong was an exception. He was talking through out the whole movie, and he stared at me for no reason. Weird.   So the movie was over, and we made a little trip to sunshine plaza. This time, the figurine stores were all open. There was the One Piece figurines, doreamon too and lots more. The One Piece Island was huge, even larger then what I had in mind. All the figurines were all so cute and detailed. I had a sudden urge to buy them. Too bad for me, what I was eyeing on was out of stock. Here's the website of the figurine shop I was talking about-->> " urlLink www.latendo.com " Next we headed into a gundam shop, cool place. The model there was assembled and so nicely painted, so impressed ^_^.  Then it was another round of window shopping for me at Sim Lim Square. Desmond got himself a new mouse pad, Kah Loong got a new game, and I got myself a nice walk. WAhahaa...  back at home, Lao Er got so angry with the printer because it was printing with lots of unwanted line(its has been like this for weeks), she wanted to fix it. And so she got me involved with the wrecking. This Epson C60 was so much different from the Epson colour 460 I took apart the other time (yes I did wreck the hold printer), this C60 used internal locking system like snap together model kits, instead of screws like the colour 460. I wonder how they would be going about service the C60, with out spoiling the plastic lock. It took me quite a while to remove the casing, what followed was to remove the metal bar. The last time I did that, I didn't know how to put it back. This time I asked Lao Er to clean the printer head with cotton bud, through a gap. Now after that, we wanted to test the printer without the casing on. Jacked in the plug, flick the switch, but the damn thing won't come to live.   Given up rescuing the printer. Lao Er when surfing the net for a new cannon printer. I fiddled with the printer once more, PoUff~! It came back to live. But we didn't do a test print, because we're out of ink. Hahahaa.... all that work with my hands spotted black, and we ran out of iNk! And so the printer is left aside, until some one is kind enough to loan us their colour cartridge for a test print.   HANDS WASHING TIME! BYE~ V(^_^)V
