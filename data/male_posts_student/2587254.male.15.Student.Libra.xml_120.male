I'm still trying to adapt to daylight savings time.....so boring. Well headed downstairs then and ate, then headed out the door. Ugh school's been so repetitive lately. I mean if it weren't for the english plays, good test marks and watching everyone get in trouble in programming class.....wow would school be super-boring. But then again...isn't school already boring? Hmm......today would be a bit different though as our Heavenly Father slowly unraveled the day he had prepared for me...  Well on our way to school....amongst the fighting over radio station between Patrick and I, and the constant debates on why rock music can suck sometimes (Lenny Kravitz=SUCKS) we finally got to school....and we were on time....almost late but not quite =P. History class today.....studied D-Day. Not much excitement.....I learned too much from MOHAA when me and Paul played it at his house over LAN lol. Oh yeah but then after all that...the suspense came...  LITERACY TEST RESULTS!? AWW CRAP. Something I've been hoping to avoid all year. Blast it finally comes. Then slowly....as I take it....out...of....the.....en....vel.....ope.............................................................  ......................................................................................  I PASSED! WHOO! YES! I'M LITERATE ACCORDING TO THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT! YAY I'M THAT MUCH CLOSER TO GRADUATING! NO MORE PANICKING! I CAN READ! I CAN WRITE! NO ABC LEARN FOR ME! WHOO!  Yes I passed.....and then announcements came on. Lalalalala..............I PASSED! *Apparently 5/300 Gr. 10 students failed.* Oh yeah got course verification forms today also. Need to figure out basically my life by next Friday *eep.* Prayer request please? =).  Civics class we worked on our leader assignments today. Whoo.....I get to do a whole assignment on JFK. You know, Cuban Missle Crisis? Got assasinated? Youngest president ever of USA? Well I'm stuck with doing him....which I'm not exactly complaining about compared to what others got. James Naismith? I mean it's an easy subject but BASKETBALL? *Shrug* What kind of leadership rubric does Canada have? You invent a sport and you're acclaimed a "leader?" Wow......next time I'll invent like........Chinese Checkers and win that. Oh wait it's been invented *BLAST!* I still find History and Civics back-to-back REALLY boring. I don't get WHY this school seems to think it's perfectly fine for a student to take over 10 pages of notes in one morning. I'm gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome probably soon from all this writing. Typing's different....more healthy maybe? =P. Not. Oh well.....I don't CARE. Typing's more efficient then graphite on paper. And I'm rambling....  Lunch: Went to Jasper's today with the Mopsta and Mike. Did theory H/w and ate.  and Now I'm going to zip through the rest of my day as NCAA finals are on now!  -Math: Got bashed on about Nowitzki Jersey by Courtney. Who cares though she's wearing Iverson jersey....the jersey that almost every kid has even though Philly SUCKS.  There's a reason why no one buys his jersey anymore. -Programming: did programming.....drew pictures....surfed net. -Home: Drummed....sc......etc etc.  And NOW I GO STUDY AND WATCH NCAA FINALS!  DON'T KNOW WHO I'M CHEERING FOR BUT *SHRUG.*   LATES!=P
