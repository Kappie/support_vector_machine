That means I really need to get my ass out to go see it tomorrow. Yoda is incredibly bad ass in that movie. Mace Windu rules too. Anakin gets on my nerves though...  In other news... I had work today, bought some CD-Rs, and worked on my paper. I'm up to a solid 8 pages. That means 53% done.  Work wasn't too great. The big boss came in again! Weekends aren't cool anymore!  Stuff I need to do tomorrow:   Go to the movies.   Do Soc Sci 3a stuff.   Work on History paper.     Put in Valleau's anaylsis of  Blockade .   Write about the Knights of Columbus.   Go into the Legion of Decency and their rating.   Write about the Left.   Time to go to bed so I don't fall asleep in the theater!  ***
