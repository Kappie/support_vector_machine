"poorthing" and "dramastic" aren't a good word to describe me.. and i'm still waiting for the rightful word to suit the rightful me..    look at the time.. time for tuition again.. guess i'm going again to tolerate the crazy jokes and ideas of my teacher and junior huh.. ya.. this is all for the "Start of The Count"   ..
