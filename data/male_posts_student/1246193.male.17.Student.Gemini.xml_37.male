That was how it started.  We had a substitute that looked strangely familiar, gray and balding, he was wearing all black.  Out of nowhere he pulls out a weird looking machine gun and all of his followers burst in through the windows.  They busted through the windows in a upward direction which makes it seem like they jumped from the ground but I really don't know because I didn't see them.  I was sitting in my old seat in the back, right hand corner of the room.  The sub just starts randomly picking people out by name and shooting them.  He killed a bunch of people that tried to escape out the door.  Then he shot Morgan Watson in the stomach.  Then he turned his gun to me and told me he wouldn't make me suffer.  He shot me in the head 16 times.  I was dead and no one, except the other dead people who were sitting in desks,  could see or hear me.  Then he shot Katie Manson but I don't know where.  I asked someone if we were in heaven and whoever it was said that it was probably pergatory.  Suddenly we are all in some kind of a field with a grain elevator in the middle but if you looked down you could see Stonington.  Everyone from English was there but nobody else.  I was looking at the grain elevator and turned around only to find Ms. Pedigo standing behind me.  Somehow I just understood the second I saw her that she was God.  She made a speech to everyone standing around that since we were going to be here for a while we could take English classes.  Bethany and I were the only two that signed up but then I left.  Another sudden jump and we are all standing on top of a fence having no trouble balancing.  We followed some signs looking for grapes and we made it to some building in Clinton.  Spencer told everyone that Clinton was famous for its grape jelly.  We looked out the windows and saw a lot of old people, sitting on their porches, canning grapes.  We wanted to pick our own grapes but they apparently had stopped that practice because people got hurt.  I don't really know how we could have gotten hurt if we were dead.  Ms. Pedigo/God Almighty was very upset because we went all the way to Clinton to pick grapes and we couldn't.  I didn't understand why God wouldn't have known that they stopped picking grapes in Clinton.  We jumped out of the windows onto the fence and started again to walk home to the field above Stonington.    I woke up and looked at my clock.  It was 2:30 in the morning.  I never wake up in the middle of the night.  This dream is going to provoke a lot of analyzing on my part.  I have a feeling that Ms. Pedigo isn't God, but you never know.
