Tonight I'm going to look at two blogs, and then I'm going to fall asleep, since I'm going to work up at the school for a few hours tomorrow morning.  So, without much further ramble, here are your Late Night Bloggin' blogs for the nite:    urlLink A Wolf at the Door   Rating: ***  What's that?  A good blog? Yep, that's correct.  I like this one.  His writing style is unique, something I haven't seen in too many blogs.  Most of the time I see blogs, they're normally crazed teenagers talking about other people's blogs, or using dialogue like, "Omg wtf?!  Some1 is soooo hot!"  That's not the case with this one.  I'm not sure how old this guy is, but, based on his constant style of dissing George W., I'd say he's older.  This one is pretty good, but, only check it out if you like to read stuff unexpectedly.      urlLink My Bittersweet Symphony   Rating: **  I love the name of this blog... it reminds me of a song that I have loved for the majority of my life (Bitter Sweet Symphony, The Verve).  But, you may have noticed, in the review of the blog above, I mentioned something about all the "omg omg omg" stuff... well, that blog tends to do that a lot.  Will I ever find a blog that I find to be absolutely flawless???  Probably not.  Not even Blog of BagelÂ® is perfect.  It's got its flaws too, like a crazed, Bloggermaniac who posts crap about other peoples' blogs!  Hey, wait...that's ME!!!  Anywho... kudos for the title "My Bittersweet Symphony."  I like it.  And, that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  I'm going up to The River High School tomorrow to do a little bit of work in the guidance office (community service, can't have too much of that!).  So, I'll post something early in the morning, and then head out for a few hours, and then be back for more blogging.  I'll have 1 more camp story (at least) tomorrow, and then some other stuff.  So, until tomorrow, then, get some sleep or something.
