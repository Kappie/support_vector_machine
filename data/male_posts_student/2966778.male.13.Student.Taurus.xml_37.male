I'm doing this since she used up my  prepaid  "internet-card" or whatever you call it, even though she had bought one with twice the amount of  taka  for herself (50 taka for me, 100 taka for her).  Anyway, when I finish, I'm gonna copy and paste this into the new post thing in Blogger.  I get 25 minutes of  free internet  because when my sister bought that card for me, the guy at the little excuse-for-a shop of office stuff gave her a card with a username and password for free.  Okay, now let's talk about my trip from New York to Bangladesh on Kuwait Airways.  We got on the plane and guess what!?  Since we arrived there late, my Dad and I got our seats moved from Economy Class to Business Class.  Lucky for my Mom, she got to sit with my Grandma in Economy Class.  Well, they gave us little souveniers in Business Class.  Then we got little toiletry bags complete with even disposable slippers.  Well, it was so much roomier than in Economy Class.  You could watch TV.  I watched snippets of Starsky and Hutch, Agent Cody Banks and some other movies.  You could also play this really old Nintendo Inflight System, which I never knew existed until now.  We sailed for approximately 11 hours and got off in Kuwait.  This place was horrible.  We had to stay for 7 friggin' hours.  The place was horrible.  We got free food that tasted horrible.  I took a paper Pepsi cup and got two cups of water.  When one of the waiters saw, he took them away from me and told me to use one of the tiny cups.  I used the cups to get water out of the   slushee machine  .   Even my Dad, who had worked in Kuwait over 20 years ago, says nothing's changed.  There were people smoking all over the place, even the officials.  I was afraid to drink the water from the water fountain.  When the 7 hours were up, I, along with my parents and Grandma, got onto the plane.  This time I had to sit in Economy.  These people were now mostly Bengali people with no manners.  People refused to fasten their seatbelts, some were doing crazy stuff.  Luckily it was only a 4 hour flight.  I watched a movie that I think was called House of Sand and Fog.  When the plane had landed, some dumb guy jumped from his seat to get his carry-on and get this, the plane hadn't stopped yet, and the little seatbelt icon was still lit.  Well, then we got off at Zia International Airport in Dhaka, that's spelled like that, not Dacca, thank you very much.  Things ran smoothly in there since we knew people who could do  things  in Bangladesh.  Now, I stay in an apartent that has a room with air-conditioning.  There's no computer now.  I get to use my sister's computer when I go over.  It's really hot in Bangladesh.  I have an upset stomache right now.  I just saw a glitched-up bootleg of Spider-Man 2 on TV qand it's awesome (the movie, not the quality of the version).  I'm talking real fast aren't I?  So the time in Bangladesh is 4:35pm/16:35 right now and the date is July 10, 2004.  It's, I guess, around 6:35am in New York right now?  I don't know what time it is.  Wow, this is a  HUGE  post.  I wish I could watch I Love the 90s!  :(
