I am so glad it is finally done! The downside of doing a cover of a song is by the time you've learnt all the parts to it, you never want to hear it again.  Also today I have working on updates for my t-shirt website, as I will be soon buying the equipment to print them myself instead of contracting an external company to do it - which means more profit for me! Luckily for me, I can afford this equipment because my ICT teacher at school, and his best mate Paul are investing Â£250 each into my website!  Whilst I was working on the site, by coincedence, Paul rang me today to confirm we are meeting up next Thursday (which is also the day my AS Results come out!) to set up a joint business bank account so I can order the equipment! I'll post a blog then to say how it goes.  So anyway that's it for today - 8 days until my results come out!
