I know now you guys like I'm weird but, I just sit and think when I'm bored and I don't want to watch tv or read. But anyway back to my point I found this red notebook that I wrote in like once because I was depressed or whatever and I wanted to write it down because I thought it would help and now I'm going to start writing in that when I go into those "deep thought" session or episodes, you pick what you want to call them. I think I might benefit me in the long-run, ya' never know.    I'm gunna have to get back into my old sleeping habits since we're starting school on August 16th. The only benefit that we get from going to school before everybody else is that we get out of school earlier. But I have to walk to school, I mean I can walk to school but it's just the walking to school in the winter that gets me worried because I might wake up late and I can ride my bike in the snow. Then there's that fact that I'd have nobody to take me to school, so I'd either have to walk to school and be later or stay home. Exactly why I have to get to sleep earlier and all that good stuff because if I don't I'll fall asleep in class, *stop laughing, last year I had sleeping problems* I won't wake up late, and I remembered that they say that if you don't get enough sleep then you don't "grow" at the rate you're supposed to. so yeah. But I guess I'll go now since it'slike 2:42 am right now and I'm still typing. Good sleepy time *inside joke* ^_^
