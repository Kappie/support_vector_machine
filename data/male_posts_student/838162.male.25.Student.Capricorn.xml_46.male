On top of that I have added some more links to other blogs. This one is long in coming since  Da Man  (no no…not that DA MAN) is so featured on this blog, especially in the tag-board. Of course it’s only justice that I include his better half in my links as well. Happy now D?  I’m also looking to add more links to other bloggers. So my old friends, if you have one that I am not aware of and don’t mind me adding it here, let me know. In the meantime, I’m also looking at other interesting blogs of people that I do not know. Will start off with Singaporean ones first. Will let you know when I do so.    >   On the personal side, I currently seem to be on some sort of emotional balance scale (you know, those things we used in physics class to compare the weights of objects? the lawyers would know what I mean). On one hand I have closure to questions that I have been wondering almost the whole of last year, and I have affirmation and encouragement of my character and the demise of one of my greatest fears. It’s great to be released of these burdens.  But on the other hand, the outcome of the situation doesn’t seem to reflect the good things, and the speed of and change to this current status is something that I cannot fully wrap my mind around.   Is it “How can everything be so right and yet seem so wrong?” or “How can everything seem so right and yet Be so wrong?” How can I find the answer to the question if I’m not even sure which one of the two is the question?   How can I be so encouraged and uplifted yet be so alone and empty? How does one praise someone and yet move to a state what puts that person in a negative light?  *shakes head* this is going to take some getting used to. And the answers can go longer be given, but have to be found.
