I remeber playing it when i was a kid so I went hunting for it and found it at Target. hahaha. fun. Bought some beer too, and a alot of warm conversations with mimi and the TV played the mexican history in the background. It's nice to be married to someone you actually love. I feel bad for those people that get married for all the wrong reasons. Good luck to them.   :)   current mood: dorky current music: the radio and random mp3s
