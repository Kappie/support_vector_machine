           
        I just finished reading Nehemiah, a truly mythic book (in the Bible) with great evocations. And it's also historically accurate. (Can you beat that?) I came up with this "rag" (as in a rough shred) poem thinking about N's faith-driven persistence. Maybe it's more of a song lyric, really.     The strength of the builders is failing, There are no stories told at all. Hearts misplaced in piles of rubble, I wonder who will build the wall.  The men are praying to their weapons, There is no singing anymore. Hope is locked inside the temple, Faith scorched like the city doors.  The square is filled with propaganda, Flyers and letters by the ton. Every morning a new mantra, But we’ll have truth when work is done.   © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst
