      Yo yo yo. So poetry club went ok. My brief tenure as president will probably be eventless, as we have few people attending over the summer, so my rule of the iron fist will be fairly short. I've got a new movie brewing. There will be no script for this one. Hopefully it won't turn into a full fledged disaster, but I guess it'd be kind of cool if it did. I like watching that Hindenburg footage, after all. After talking with my roommate the other day I came to the conclusion that if I don't get some kind of for rizzle dizzle girlfriend soon my neuroses will probably just completely envelope my mind and I'll never ever get a girlfriend. Now, this is in the dangerous territory known as settling for whomever one may find, but I don't know. I'm in a rough spot, I think. I guess I really don't need a girlfriend, in the long run, since most of the stuff I like doing is solitary in nature, but there will be a time when all of my friends are married, engaged, or otherwise entangled romantically, and then when they have their dinner parties I'll be the guest everybody feels awkward around. I don't get why society demands we have to hook up with somebody. Why the hell can't I just be alone, goddamnit? Well, I'll stop ranting.  Nick Dalie, I don't think I'd call Eternal Sunshine my favorite movie, but it's definitely a damned good one. I think I prefer adaptation, even. Not to detract from it, and people should go see it, although it's gone from the regular theater now. It'll probably be in dollarland pretty soon. On the flip flop of things, there are no prostitutes wandering my street anymore. I am so fucking happy.
