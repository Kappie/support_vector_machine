I remember IE 2.0 - the bastard son of bill - that thing couldn't get a fucking page right if you paid in in gold pressed latinum. Netscape was sort of "the big thing" for the first three iterations of the software. Microsoft's IE was a laughable endevour - essentially the behemoth arriving late to the party - and a dollar short no less. Inferior in the way of features, stability and speed, IE simply couldn't compete. I remember the tide turning slowly with IE 3... and then 4. Active X started to play a large role in people switching, that and microsoft packaging their browser with every new operating system. I suppose I'm as guilty as anyone of the lazy nature which gave rise to IE spawning itself on my system - I did download 2, wasn't impressed, deleted it(remember when we used to delete things?). Downloaded 3, but out of a h@x0r-spirit inspired rebellion, I unistalled that. Finally IE 4 found a home on my system. Being able to surf with impugnity and not encounter broken links to active X scriptlets seemed to be netnirvana.  I don't regurlarly agree with the US government, but I must admit MS did have an unfair advantage. Have the stifled or strangled the market? I hope not.   That's my small bit on computer history for today.  I'm thinking about starting a small content based portal site. A few of the lads from work said they'd contribute - mostly reviews and opinions and such. I'd imagine we could all have our little rants. We'll see how it works out.
