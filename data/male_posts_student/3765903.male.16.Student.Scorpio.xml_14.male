Right - I have had loads of reviews asking me who it was that I wrote about in   '  urlLink Tourniquet  '  -  my first ff.net songfic - and if you really feel that you need to know then well... I'm sorry to disappoint you but I have no answer to that question!  I guess the whole point of me writing it so that you couldn't quite tell which of the Ed's it was, was so that the people reading it could make up their own mind on just who they thought that person should be. Personally - I do not know who it was. I think it could have been any of them for several amounts of reasons. And so I guess that beings me to another point of the fic which would be to show that, although the three are so very different in their personality and their outlook on life and whatnot, when it really comes down to it, they are exactly the same. I guess that might not make much sense (and if you did understand it pls comment or sumfink coz I'd like to know if it's just me being insane...) but still... yeah... Sorry to leave you hanging like this, but hey... Im a mean kinda person ^_^
