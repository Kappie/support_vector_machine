His IM name is basically stating he doesn't give a fuck about Canada. Fine, that's his opinion. I want to know why. So I ask, like any other person might. What I comes down to is that he simply doesn't like Canada. He believes we're arrogant towards the US of A. Now I ask you, where the hell is he coming from on this? For the last hundred years or so Canada has pretty much been Americas bitch. So it seems that Americans think anytime Canada stands up for itsself or any other country we're being arrogant and egotistical. The Americans ban our produce for the most trivial of reasons and expect us not to give so much as a wimper while when we quietly point out that the war on Iraq is completely fucking pointless except to satisfy American pride and fill American coffers(And gas tanks). What, you're saying Saddam was a tyranical bastard who deserved to be removed? Why I do belive you're right. So, when is America going to move into all those other oppressed countries and "free" them. You know, the ones without any oil or money? Bah, the world makes me angry. This isn't directed at you man, nor the American people in general. I simply don't like your country or its policies. Or, for that matter, its president.  That being said the rest of my day wasn't to bad. Slept, messed with the comp, went to watch the fireworks. Only sucky part was that my girlfriend had to work until after midnight and so I couldn't watch them with her. Other than that though a good day alround.  Proud To Be Canadian,  -Dant
