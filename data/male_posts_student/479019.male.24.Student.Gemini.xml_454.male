After I got home I ate and took my laptop to Best Buy for repairs. Then I napped a bit before finally delivering the tea and spoon to Steff. Then Steff and I went grocery shopping. It was fun... that girl was fondling all the stuff in the store... like the cakes, tofu, etc. Then I napped some more and I was able to watch Smackdown for the first time in ages.  It's great to be home.  ****
