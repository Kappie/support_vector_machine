Seen it once before tonight. I went and saw it with JoJo and Steve also named the Shady Godfather for reason not aloud to be told. Anyway went to the movies, and saw Steve, talked to him for a bit, waiting for JoJo. Waited....no JoJo....waited again....thought we saw her..not JoJo. Then...JOJO! Yeah I had called to see if she was lost or something but then she ran up to Steve hugged him and I said hey and all. Forgot how hot she was but she’s taken and I am too, so not a lot of attraction in that kind of way. Watched movie. Heard Steve and JoJo making out. Kept watching the movie. Then I thought about Alyssa and started to miss her, because she’s in the Pocono’s and all. Then the movie ended. I started singing along with Vindicated, and JoJo I think gave me a look but ah well it doesn't matter. Yeah so we left, waited for my dad. Kind of showed of my car but before that we talked for a bit. Didn't really get a goodbye from JoJo but hell I'll survive. Yeah now I'm home missing Alyssa and drinking red Gatorade. Now the Lyrics from Vindicated:   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated  {Chorus} I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me  So isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  {Chorus}  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away (3x) So let me slip against the current So let me slip away (4x)  {Chorus}  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...
