Nobody writes about the love of God like  urlLink Brennan Manning . This slim volume examines why so many Christians live life under a dark cloud of impending judgment rather than with a spirit of encouragement. The heart of the matter has to do with a believer's image of God -- the dispassionate judge versus the loving father. So often a person feels he can never measure up and puts on a public persona --  urlLink Manning  calls it The Impostor -- who appears to perform flawlessly. This make-believe is what robs us of true intimacy with God and genuine community with others. A much-needed book for the church today.
