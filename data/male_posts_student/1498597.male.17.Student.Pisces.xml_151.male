Yeah, contribute all hatred toward the school and their fucked up system!  Anyway, much has happened since the last time I blogged (I dunno when I last blogged)!  I know the readers, or should I say "the privelaged few" have been expectin' me to spew out more of my aspects on life and the things mashed into it.  I haven't got anythin' to say at this moment, really.  Actually, I am warmin' up some food to eat, and would rather eat than blog at the moment.  I might be up for awhile so maybe I will blog again.  I have some ideas to present to you, the public, and therefore will make the effort to try to blog later.  I also havta cover the  Graveyard Shift  for  Nick and I's   Three Eye Witnesses !  Anyway, I'll see ya later.  More to come...!
