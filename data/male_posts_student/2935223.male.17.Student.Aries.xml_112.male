The trip out here was  HELL .  I don't look orward to the trip home...except the fact that I will be able to see all me "loving" friends. ********************* Had a pretty good night last night talking to people on MSN until about midnight, Mountain Time.  Woke up UBER early.  Couldn't find the toothpaste so I decided to go on the comp instead. Read blogs when I realizedI could now. Was disturbed and hurt by sum of the thing I read.  Isn't it great bein' loved?*rolls eyes* ********************* Sittin' here now, about to go do sumthin' that I don't kare to do, don't know what it is, prety sure it will suck though.  Alrighty, Peace Out!  C ya all in less then a week or so. Spense  P.S. Will keep upating and checking email and such.
