If you have seen it, all of the ranting I just did makes a little more sense, and hopefully will remind you fondly of such a great flick. I was laughing even before it started. And the best part: it takes place entirely in Idaho. Come on, name me one other movie that even involves Idaho in any way. I dare you.
