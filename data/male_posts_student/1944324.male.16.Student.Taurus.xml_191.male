One of my friends actually had a relationship for shorter than that.. It was only for 30 seconds but it was forced so it might not really count to you people. Her parents don't want her to date until after high school either. Which brings me to the fact that I have a boyfriend! No Marten you cannot hit him with your stick. He comes to my locker every morning and he walks me to my bus after school and thats almost the only time I get to see him, but oh well.  SQ(u)EE!
