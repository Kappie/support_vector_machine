I would love to say that my reticense in doing so is due to how horribly busy I've been, but saying that would just be lying :P No, the fact is I just haven't done it...    ANYWAY...the big news of late is that I'm GRADUATED!! Yep, somehow I passed Spanish (heck, I got a B!!), so I'm finally finished with KSU. I have to admit that I didn't have such hostile feelings towards the place until this last semester, but I suppose all will be forgiven once law school starts and college seems like such a pleasant memory :P I'm actually thinking about going to graduation now; I wasn't planning on going, but John (my boss) told me that I should reconsider since it probably means more to other people than to me. So we'll see (although I'm still leaning towards no - I mean, this isn't my LAST graduation ;).    Speaking of law school, I got my schedule and all from CSU today. I think my schedule looks pretty favorable; I don't have to be at class until 2:45 Monday, and I'm done with classes at 11:10 on Friday, so I really like it. Of course, the main thing is the teachers I'm going tohave, so I'm going to run some names by a couple of people who have been at CSU. And I've heard that the first year of law school is the "weeding out" period and is hard as anything, so I'm not really looking forward to that. I've been reading a book called "One-L" by a guy who was in his first year of law school at Harvard, and after reading it I'm kind of looking forward to and kind of dreading law school. I think I'm going to like the fact that we're only studying ONE topic and the general competitiveness of the classes, but I also know I'm probably going to hate the pressure to study and do well and the one-exam-for-your-grade method.   I was talking to my cousin today and told him that I was looking forward to DOING law, but not so much studying it. The experience I'm having with CPD and with PDS gave me a real taste of whatit means to DO law and actually have clients, real people, relying on you. But I also know that I'm not looking forward to three more years of studying; the whole studying thing started to get old for me my junior year of high school, and time hasn't exactly tempered my opinion in this regard.   I also helped do some roofing today. A single-mom in our church needed a new roof, so a bunch of us volunteered to help take off her old one and put on the new. Of course, I didn't realize that we were going to start at 7 AM!! But I dragged myself out of bed and got there by 7:30. Taking off the roof was a real bear - there were two or three layers of roofing, and every time we tried to take a layer off our shovels caught on some nails and we had to pry them out. So that took about three hours and left me with two really painful blisters :(  Then we started putting the new roof on. Fortunately, we had three or four guys there who either do roofing as their jobs or used to do roofing, so they knew how to do all of the "technical stuff." And we got three nail-guns goin (that's what I did all day :D), so things were moving pretty smoothly. Still, even with experienced people doing things and three nail-guns goin, we didn't get "finished" (we ran out of shingles) until about 5:30, by which time I had been thoroughly cooked and was ready to be turned inside-out like the lobster I felt like. But despite all the hard work it took and all I've really been looking for things like this to do, so it was really great to be able to get out and do something.  Speaking of work, things have been going well there. I spent a couple of days last week helping move John's stuff from his old office to his new one; to say that this was a HUGE undertaking is a vast understatement. I swear that I have never seen an office more chaotic and disorderly than his; when you walk in there  literally  isn't anyplace to stand, not to mention sit (there are two chairs / paper stacks). So basically what I did was go in, get a paper-box full of papers from his old office, take them into his new office, sort them, file them (if possible), then repeat the process. To say it was tedious would be a slight understatement, but I didn't mind doing it simply because it gave me something to do (sometimes it seems like I'm a person with a job but nothing to do).   But I've also been doing some other miscellaneous tasks lately, a couple of which have been really interesting and informative. One of the things that I noticed while I was going through John's cases was a new Supreme Court decision called  Blakely ; I had heard a couple of people talking about it in the office, so I took the opportunity to read most of it. Basically,  Blakely  holds that a judge doesn't have the right to add more than the maximum sentence on a defendant convicted of a crime, even if a state law allows him to, if the jury does not also believe that such a sentence if appropriate beyond a reasonable doubt.   Anyway, the immediate significance of  Blakely  (for me) is that John called me in the middle of last Friday afternoon and asked me to go down to a judge's courtroom and take notes on a sentencing proceeding that he may have a  Blakely  objection to. So I went down, but it seemed like things were a little confusing - the judge actually kept jumping back and forth between two or three cases, none of which was a sentencing hearing. Finally, when I was about to leave, the sentencing proceeding finally started. While I was pretty well-prepared for the note-taking and reporting part, I wasn't at all prepared for the way the proceeding was going to affect me emotionally, etc.   The case I was viewing was for a 21-year-old Latino guy who had been convicted of attempted murder for arranging a hit on a girl who was accusing him of rape (the hit never went through and the girl ended up being fine). The prosecutor went first; in my opinion it seemed like the judge already had his mind made up about the sentencing by the way it seemed he led the prosecutor in his arguments. Basically, Ohio law allows a sentence greater than the maximum proscribed by law if the crime is one of the worst forms of an offense or if the convict poses a clear threat for committing the crime again. The prosecutor / judge argued that he fell under both (he had a number of other offenses pending as well, from narcotics to pimping to auto theft). The defense lawyer got up and naturally tried to argue against the maximum penalty, but it just seemed like everything was stacked against him.   After the defense lawyer finished the guy who committed the crimes got up and spoke. I will never claim to be a great criminal psychologist, but it was especially hard to read this guy - he said all the "usual" things about being really sorry about what he had done and all, but it was hard to tell whether he was being insincere or if the whole proceeding was kind of overwhelming him.   Then his mother got up to speak. I must say that I have never seen a woman who looked more as if life had simply beaten her and she was done fighting - her demeanor communicated a sense of great sorrow, of a heart heavy from all the wrongs committed against her, and she simply knew she was doing nothing but playing out whatever string of life she may have left. She stopped briefly to speak with her son, something I got the feeling she hadn't had the opportunity to do in a long time. From her I found out a lot of other things about this guy - he had been in and out of foster homes since he was 4, in and out of prison since he was 18, and his father had been convicted of rape and murder and had been abusive at home.   By this time I was starting to feel really heartbroken about the whole thing. I know that what this guy had done wasn't ok by any stretch of the imagination, but it just didn't seem like anyone had EVER been there for him, not even in the smallest of ways the rest of us normally take for granted. And then the judge handed down the maximum plus extra time (it all added up to 11.5 years), and it just seemed like everything fell apart for me. I rationally knew that it was probably the right penalty by law, but it reimpressed upon me the way in which our criminal "justice" system is more bent upon punishment than rehabilitation. The mother hardly even reacted at first - I think that for her it was crushing, but in a way similar to any number of other events in her life. I think that she eventually started to weep, but her posture didn't change throughout the whole thing, but that was only because she had come in with the same sorrowful and defeated sense that one typically only sees once a negative verdict or sentence has been passed down.   While the guy being sentenced hadn't showed a whole lot of emotion throughout the whole proceeding, after everything was over he turned around and I could see that his eyes were really red. His mother asked the bailiff if she could speak with him and he said no, that he had to be taken down right away for processing. Now I KNOW that maybe that's technically true, but I also know that the guard was simply being hard about things, that he could have shown a little compassion and let the woman speak with her son (who she may not see again for a long time).   But two things really hit me hard about the whole thing. Number one was how easy it would have been for me to be in that chair and for him to be sitting where I was; he and I were nearly the same age, but for some reason he had been born into a poorer and abusive home and I had been born into a home where things were provided. Of course, being thankful for what I had been given was a natural response to this realization, but it was heavily tempered by an underlying sense that it all seemed so unfair, that there was no joy to be taken from what had just happened.  The second thing that hit me was simply how this whole life-changing event for this guy had happened and there were only six of us in the courtroom at the time. No one, aside from his mother and perhaps myself and maybe the defense lawyer, felt a profound sense of sorrow for what had happened to this kid and what he had done, and no one really cared. In fact, virtually no one even knew that this guy had beenconvicted or sentenced. And we were in the 21st floor of the Justice Center, in one of four courtrooms, so I just wonder how often other people have their lives destroyed in a similar way and no one even knows about it.  Fast forward to yesterday (Friday). About halfway through the afternoon John comes in and asks me if I want to go with him to a meeting with a judge;  of course  I agree to go. On the way there he also lets me know that he's actually going over to have a "cup of coffee" with a Yale law-school student (who are like GODS in the law-school-student circles), so by the time we get up to the meeting I'm feeling a little intimidated (a Yalie AND a judge?!). The Yale guy looked exactly like the prototypical Northeasterner stereotype people usually think of Yale Law School kids looking like - you know, more likea high-level executive perfectly at ease when hanging out people in positions of power. Very different than the farmer or blue-collar types I typically associate myself with.  Anyway, the judge we were meeting with was the same one who was presiding over the sentencing hearing I went to the week before; also in attendance was an appeals prosecutor (who actually was a very young woman). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the implications of Blakely, so I didn't feel totally lost. But I couldn't believe how seemingly effortlessly they were thowing around cases and definitions and terms and rules; maybe it's knowledge by familiarity, but it was still really impressive. I thought that the judge was actually pretty personable and not overly pompous, and it was really neat for me to be able to sit in on a meeting that I thought might actually have long-term consequences.  Then I went home and we won our two softball games - WOOHOO! :)
