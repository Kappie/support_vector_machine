We actually spent most of the night at chris's trying to hook up his original nintendo and play old school games on it.  saturday i did run about 2.5 to 2.75 miles in 20 minutes to the YMCA to lift weights.  i didnt lift but a few weights because i was tired after running.  so i just called my mom to come and pick me up.  then i helped pick up the house for this party my parents were having.  after that i went to chris's house and ate dinner and what not.  shelby and tyler were also there.  i brought all my NES games and we beat Kirby's dream land in about 3 hours.  it was worth it because we saved dream land from the nightmare.  When i arrived home the people were still here and i ate some of the left over deserts.  Everyone finally left at about 215 am and i went to sleep at about 245.  sunday we all slept in til about 1200 and when we awoke we went almost immediately to the track banquet at BE.  it was pretty fun and the track scrapbook was pretty cool also.  I was dissapointed that the seniors did not do the paper plate awards because apparently people would cry about the awards which is total shit because they are meant to be in good fun.  last year i got the goofy award.
