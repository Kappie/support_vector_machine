Damn I need XP.  But on a happier note I thought i was going to get like a D in physics so I went and talked to my prof and she told me that I had a 64 which scared the fuck out of me.  But then she said that with the final I could get up to an 84 because she didn't have it figured in to the grade yet so all I need is a 75 on the final to get a B.  I can handle that.  SO this semester I have the possibility to get 2 A's and 1 B but it will probably be 1 A and 2 B's..  both work for me though so it's cool.  OK I gotta go work and then to write a paper and study some.  Damn finals...
