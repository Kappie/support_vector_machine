First half began as even as it gets but the Germans slowly got more out of the game and eventually, through a bananenflanke from Torsten Frings, scored the first after 30 minutes. Netherlands tried to reach the German box and create opportunities but the German defense played a consistent game.  Ruud van Nistelrooij managed to get a ball behind past Oliver Kahn 10 minutes before the ref blow his whistle for the last time and I believe the two sides were satisfied/unsatisfied with the result.  My Man of the Match: Michael Ballack
