In the tradition of our forefathers and formums, we snacked on hamburgers and hot dogs and then blew stuff up real good in the street in front of their house. A good time was had by all.    After the eating but before the blowing stuff up, I took all four of Kathy's kids and a friend of the family on motorcycle rides through the neighborhood. (Not all of them rode with me at once, mind you -- they went one at at time.) None of them had ever ridden on a motorcycle before... you never forget your first time. I rode on the back of my dad's bike when I was quite young.  I put about 40 miles on Maggie the Magna just by tooling around. The youngest girl, Jamie, wasn't at all sure she wanted to go once she got up next to the bike, so I took her around the block and then asked if she wanted to continue. She did. Because of a navigational mistake on my part, her ride ended up being longer than those I gave to her older brothers. She has promised not to gloat.  As a moto-pusher I'm happy to have shared my addiction with a few more people. The first one is always free. We get the kids hooked on our junk and then raise the price. ;-)  The Motorcycle Safty Foundation reminds you to "Start SEEING motorcycles." ...and if you like one of them enough, settle down and start a family.
