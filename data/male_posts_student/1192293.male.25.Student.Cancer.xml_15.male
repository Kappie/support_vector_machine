Hell in a hand-basket, here we come.  I'm so glad all you republican morons out there elected these dangerous fools so that we can all die in a war.  Thanks a fuckin' ton.  And while I'm at it, fuck Al Gore for not being able to beat this drunken coke-head schmuck.  Eight years of peace and prosperity, and you can't beat a jackass alkie executioner from Texas?  Don't give me your whining shit about Nader, either.  Gore's election should have been so sound that giving up three percent of the vote to Nader wouldn't have been any kind of concern.  Instead, he couldn't even beat the governor who authorized more executions than any other in American history.  Fucking ineptitude. Hey, elected democrats!  Grow some fucking balls!  Pansies!  P.S.- All you assholes who don't vote share the blame for this.  Get off of your asses and vote, before you loose the right.  Otherwise, fuck off.  You have no right to bitch about anything.  That's right, I said FUCK OFF.  It's  that  important.
