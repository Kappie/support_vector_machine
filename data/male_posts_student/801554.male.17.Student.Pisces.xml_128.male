Hard not to like the teacher, he's just plain fun. The other day I mentioned to him a quote I'd heard about a physicist who said something like all other sciences are just stamp collecting or something similar, and a freind of mine in another class said he'd mentioned the quote to them. Ah, I'm quite sad, I know, but this delighted me.  Currently listening to: the best of R.E.M.
