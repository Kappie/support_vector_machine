Forget all the thing's I should have said...  So I speak to you in riddles,  'cause my words get in my way.  I smoke the whole thing to my head  And feel it wash away...  'cause i can't take anymore of this,  I wanna come apart... And dig myself a little hole,  Inside your precious heart.  'cause its always raining in my head... Forget all the things I should have said...  I am nothing more than a little boy inside, That cries out for attention, Though I always try to hide... 'cause I talk to you like children, Though I don't know how I feel... But I know I'll do the right thing, If the right thing is revealed...  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the things I should have said   -Staind
