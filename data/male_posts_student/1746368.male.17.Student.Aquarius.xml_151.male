After that we went to Starbucks and she bought me a Strawberry Creme Fappucino (or however it's spelt; it's the only thing I will drink there) and then we wandered around for a little while (ate at McDonalds) and then we went over to her house.   While we were there we pretty much only did this one puzzle that we didn't get to finish (because she had to go to work and I had to go home) and that was pretty much my whole day.  Yesterday I played some AOE (Age of Empires) and it pretty much made me sick. Now I am okay and I will probably end up playing it later tonight. Well, that's all folks.  I changed my picture, but if you want to read what it says next to his head you are going to have to click the picture, then click the same picture that appears to view it in full-size.  "E.
