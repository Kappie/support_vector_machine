And then he's (as in Alex) like, "Oh sweet, but I won't be there until the 30th or 31st, plus the boats in Daytona, not Miami."  So yes, the trip has still yet to start, but we (Nick) have already managed to screw up.  So now I get to spend one night, maybe two at a quaint little hostel on South Beach with 3 other random people, waiting for Alex to sail the boat down from Daytona.  Check it out  urlLink here .  Really though, this is nothing more than a communication error.  Once we become bound to the 34' by whatever dimensions of our boat, communications, or at least the act of communicating with each other, should become slightly more frequent.  Speaking of the boat, if anybody wants to know more about the type of boat we're on, it's a Hunter 34'.  Some information and pictures about this type of boat can be seen  urlLink here .  Our boat is named   Blue Sky  .
