All I did was use the display:none; in the CSS thing for the 3 div's created for the NavBar. I hope it stays gone to.  EDIT: Well, I think I fixed it completely again, but IE still has a --> at the very top, but what kind of MSMoronâ„¢ could you be to use IE anyway? Just check out the source code if you wan't to remove it too. If you find any better way please tell me.
