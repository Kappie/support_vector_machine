A black crow of mechanical wizardry Shaped unnaturally to natures despite Unelasticated wings of hardness and coldness A raven rising to kill and slew Weaves over desert, an anodyne hunter Of human carrion and flesh and terror Swoops over down desert, disturbing the snakes And displacing sand rising, little snowflakes  The bird races and thunders and muscles Its way to the mountains and cities to hunt With voracity of a tiger and maybe a lion Starved both and all of food for a month It flails and swoops and flaps its wings Yet its wings give rise to something anew The packages cartwheel and fall asunder To limitlessly bite down onto the land The peaceful people are unwarned, unheeded To have their lives uproariously exploded And to taste the fruit of Thanatos' scythe Falling from trees Falling from the sky  Yet this assuages the people of the jetplane Who feel their safety is compromised And inhibitive action must be taken In the interests of dynamic counterterrorism And protect their culture of sickness and money To rip sinew from sinew Limb from limb All because  These people are different  Soldier In jet plane Undiminishedly unknowing of his victims or their friends or families or anyone
