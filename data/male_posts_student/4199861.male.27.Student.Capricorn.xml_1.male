I suspect that anyone who watched the opening ceremonies on television could not help but to be caught up in the excitement of these countless peoples being brought together to this one place; marching in step not as to war, but in peace and celebration.    Men and women who on the battlefield would consider one other his mortal enemy compete instead on a field of athletic excellence.    And one could be forgiven for buying into the tired commentary of journalists better suited to newsroom sound bites than rhetorical eloquence who call all humanity to see in ourselves the potential for peaceful coexistence and community.
