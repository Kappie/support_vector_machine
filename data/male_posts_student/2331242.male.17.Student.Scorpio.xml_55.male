Oh yes, and after having read Tim's recent post, I also have something to say.  Dear teacher, whoever you are,    To many of the students at Country Day, blogs are simply a healthy manner of allowing their brain to ooze onto a page (which happens to be on the web). It's like a journal. Didn't your mommy ever tell you to write a journal? I know mine did. I remember really not wanting to. I thought it was pointless and I pitched a whiney little fit. But I realize that now that I have this blog, I am able to confront, analyze, whatever.... the stuff that is happening in my life. So don't get your panties in a bunch. Please.  Oh yeah, and when teachers and blogs get mixed together, bad things happen. Just ask Mr. Anderson.  I really should be doing math homework now. Wheeeeeee....
