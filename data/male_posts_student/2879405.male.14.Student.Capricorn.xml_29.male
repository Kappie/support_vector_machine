I also do not feel welcomed. It just gives me some funny feeling that is out of my vocabs. that there is something wrong with me. AS IF the whole world  is looking at me. So i am always eager to jump off the bus through the windows or emergency exit, looking at my watch. Why is this happening? Its not that im mad. Its lacking of self-esteam. I just read about it and i won't be wrong. I'm not writing it here to be proud of it. I won't keep my thoughts in my heart. Regardless STANDING in the MRT, LRT, bus, or whatever transport, my mind is forever twirling, beneath.
