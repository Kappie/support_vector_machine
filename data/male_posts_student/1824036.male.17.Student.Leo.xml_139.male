I threw a 40' then after that a 34' ... my best for the meet... 40' 1.25" Cody threw maybe a 42' 6" or summin...but It wasn't that good  Our team got 4th overall. Not too shabby since we got last every meet last year... :) Thats about it...  Oh yeah, I lost my Humboldt Volleyball T-shirt today... I must have left it out in the locker room when we left for the meet...so phooey...that was one of my favorite shirts too :(
