I wanted to buy Beyonce's CD "Dangerously In Love", but the shops ain't open so early. Just then, Wendy smsed, asking for company. I happily agreed!  I joined her at Sata at Civics Center. I thought she was sick or something, going to see the doctor. It turned out that she has to go for a medical check-up for Poly. Hmm. There were lotsa Poly students. Her queue number was 214. wah lao! We waited for approximately 45 minutes for that freaky number to show up. Hmm. I was listening to the radio on Wendy's handphone while waiting for her. Wah lao! It took until 1+ for the whole checkup to end. 3 hours! HaHa! Can die man! Never mind la. Her brother came looking for us, because he has to apply for some CPF thingy to pay for Wendy's poly fees.  After settling the CPF thingy, me and Wendy went to eat. We ate at Yoshinoya. How meowful! Okay. After eating, we went back to Civics for Wendy to take a passport-sized photo. We went to Tom first, and Wendy brought a pair of shorts. O.O After picture taking, we went back to Causeway Point. She photocopied her brother's birth cert, and we finally went to buy my Beyonce's CD! YaY! What a wonderful CD! Really good songs in there!   We then went back. I did my Chem homework. Wah! A lot man. Besides Redox, I did Mole Concept's 2 tutorials. It took me till 7+ to finish. Even ducks are meowing!   Hmm. Okay. The main reason why I didn't blog yesterday was that I was hooked up reading "Something More", a Harry/Draco slash. A really good Harry Potter fan fic! In total from Friday's and yesterday's, I spent more than 5 hours reading the 34 chapters. I do hope the next chapter would come up soon. It's such a captivating story. Oh god...the whole while I was reading it, powerful emotions evoked from me. The constant 'butterly-fluttering-in-my-stomach" effect whilst reading the story....the courtship, the love..kept me on constant edge. Oh man! It was great! Fantabulous! I will post a paragraph below, which I feel is the whole point of this story. I like this para very much also. Oh yes. A sentence too.  "As they both rushed towards their release, an overwhelming sense of connectedness flowed through them. All that existed was the exquisite feeling of being buried inside of someone, of being filled, of skin on skin, of heated kisses. All these sensations blended together and Draco realised with a jolt that he couldn’t tell where his feelings ended and Harry’s began. Draco suddenly became aware of the power flowing around them; a fine golden haze swirling around them; a pure and simple connection on the deepest level possible."  "Their lips met in a tender kiss. It spoke of desire and need, but most of all, it spoke of love and in the end, words weren’t needed."  Oh okay. So sue me if I had picked out the sex scenes. Sheesh. They do really describe the whole essence of this wonderful story. After all, this is a Harry/Draco slash. What is a slash if you don't have an essence to it? Okay. I am waiting with bated breath for the next chapter!  Okay. Today I mainly watched TV and did my GP homework. HaHa. I finally watched my Moulin Rouge VCD. Today, in the Unbeatables, XiaoTong was raped. Now, I've seen that scene (duhz) and I felt appalled. Now, I still continued to feel shocked. Imagine the pain she went through...it's horrible to think of! Being robbed of her virginity...that's very devastating. Gone, just like that. All because of a guy's lust. Really stupid things rapists do. Try getting raped and see how you feel, you idiot rapists out there! XiaoXing is horrible!   Okay. Here I am. Online. HaHa. Oh well. There's gonna be a gas law quiz tomorrow! Must study later. See ya then. TaTa. Night blog!
