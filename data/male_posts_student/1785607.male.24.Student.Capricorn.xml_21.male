I did choose.... and it was school.... go figure that at 7.30 pm I and the whole class realized that the teacher was not coming today... So I waste gas, time showering and getting ready, and missed good and quality TV.... anyway, what can I do about it...   So I'm here now doin' homework... not even good to go and catch a movie... !   Who cares...!!!
