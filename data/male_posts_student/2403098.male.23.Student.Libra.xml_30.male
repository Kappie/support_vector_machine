Just the bang of fireworks, and blows to the head *mine to be specific*  Oh, these things happen.  Toothless, I may be, but resolutions I do have, they are as follows:  1)  get into law school (kinda out of my hands at this point, as I already applied to them all) 2)  get into shape (how cliche can we all be here, but I'm SERIOUS) 3)  hang onto all my teeth 4)  try to better myself through orginization and discipline 5)  have meaningful and rewarding relationships with those I encounter and/or already know 6)  enjoy my last 5 months in Oklahoma  I'm very tired.  Goodnight.
