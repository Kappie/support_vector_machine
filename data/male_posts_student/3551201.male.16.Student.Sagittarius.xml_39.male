"You would never be able to win that war," the Cuban leader said. "Here you will not find a divided people."    Castro understands that America is divided right now, that winning a war takes unilateral strength. Unfortunatly, the Democrats such as Ted Kennedy don't see that we must win the war (on terror). Instead they focus and dwell on the more insignificant of things...
