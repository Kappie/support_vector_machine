Even more amazed to see the new templates in store.    I don't know why I signed up for an account in the midst of my already active (well not active per se) synik account.  Maybe it's just the nice templates that have drawn me here; I really have no idea.  What even puzzles me more is my relunctancy to get my own domain.  I think I'm just lazy.  And that would probably explain my absence from blogging or web designing.    Well let's see, it's been around 4 months (I made that number up) since I last updated, and alot--I mean ALOT--has happened.    Let's start at the beginning of the school year.  The TCHS School District found out I lived 8 feet (I made up at number too) too far away from the TC School area, and thus I was forced to attend a school near my father's place: Mark Keppel.    There, I was influenced by alot of people in almost every aspect of my life.  Marijuana was commonly seen at lunch, cigarettes were usually smoked behind shadows, and I can guarantee you almost 80% of the school's students are--or were--involved in gang related activities.  Every single day during lunch there would be the "Oooooo" from everyone who had just witnessed something like a loud sneeze.  Then one person would say just let the sneeze go.  And then there would be a fight.    However, in spite of all the idiocy, I made some close friends.  My lawyer said I had a strong case in getting back to TC because of my orchestra background; but now that I had adjusted to my new friends and my new life style, I just didn't see the need to go back.  But there was that conviction, that ecstasy, that compassion from my lawyer that changed my mind.     I went to court, told the 12 judges my story, they cried (just kidding), and unanimously voted me back to TC.  The first day I got back was a wednesday; and it was there that I saw a mass Christian meeting taking place near the flag pole.    A month later, my friend Eric told me about Christ.  I becamer a follower from then on.  And it was strange how my perception of Christianity changed when I really dug deep and found the truth.  It's so different and unique in comparison to other religions.  In no other religion, does a God come onto earth and make Himself nothing; and then die just for our salvation.  In no other religion do the Scriptures--the foundation of the religion itself--come backed with historical evidence beyond belief.  In no other religion do prophecies be made and fulfilled.  In no other religion have I changed my complete assumption of life and so on, and in no other religion have I felt so loved.    So here I am, 5 weeks before freshman year ends.  But I know this is only the beginning of a lifetime I still have to finish, so see you around.
