The really awesome paper kind of calls for a grotesquely morbid drawing, but meh...   Heh. Was told I am distant and emotionally cold yesterday.   The Velvet Teen/ Littlecat show sufficiently owned. Felt weird watching Littlecat live. Really wanted to cut the arms off of some girl who decided to interpretive dance in the middle of the lobby. You could see everybody mentally murdering her. But all was rectified when she got served byGuy and a really, really cool flamboyantly gay elf. Littlecat + pixie/robot dance = dope... The Velvet Teenare really effing good live, but turn into timid little schoolgirls when attempting to talk to the crowd between songs.   Lost the last dwindling shred of respect for Shane yesterday for his massive shame spirals at the merch table at nearly every show he attends and for his all around shadiness. Ha! If you are reading this, Shane, you are a loser!
