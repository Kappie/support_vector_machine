We first just play with the wave a little bit and then use the boogie board. Riding the wave wasn't that fast but there a certain trick to it, that i found out later on but i wish i didn't.  The trick that i use was to stand at a certain distance from the shore and wait until the wave almost comes to you and then jump forward and then you ride the wave really fast and far then you would normally.  So i use that trick to ride the board again and again. it was really fun but then i wanted to do just one more b/c we were sharing the boogie board.  So it started out really well and i end up went really fast and thought at the moment that this is best ride on the wave so far and the wave was really strong and just took me near the shore; the board grinded against the sand and side of the board hit my stomachs for about 5 second and flip me over.  it hurt so bad and my visor fell off also and i thought i lost it but my cousin found it later near the shore.    so i didn't want to ride the board anymore and decided to swim. my and my cousin went really far out and we didn't realize it though and we try to get back in. we start to see the life guard whistling and tell us to come back. i didn't realize how far we got and it was really hard for me to swim back. and my cousin was in the board trying to paddle back but she seem stuck. The life guard just started to swim out and got her back to shore.  That was definitely the highlight of the day.    well we went home and i took a shower and there was sand in my butt.  right after that my cousin (ngoc)call and invite me to go to eat at a thai restuarant with my other cousin (hue) that came to visit from santa ana.  It was good food that we had; it was pretty much the same people that went to the beach minus tony and adding hue and rachel.   after that we went to my house and just sat around thinking of what to do and pick up fruit outside in the backyard.  then we went to k-mart. and bought a towel and some dentyne ice.  It was really fun but i left out some details such as sitting on the beach to dry off and bought some stuff from a lady. we bought old M and ngoc bought a hat.  and i left out K-mart close down special on 99 cent slice of pizza, icee, hot dog and crazy bread.  and i bought an icee but it wasn't 99 cent but 1.28 b/c i came late for the special....all well.
