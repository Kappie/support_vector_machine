Up 'til now, they were the only ones, and that sucks.       It really bites to not want to talk about dead people, but as much as I know I have to remember, it's easier to just forget. I saw a photo of these girls crying about their cousin that died in the Farmer's Market "drive-thru" that happened a few months ago...      Yeah, that bites, but at least your grandmother didn't die a week before your graduation. Aint that a bitch.      Yeah, so my grandmother died. My Dad's Mom. So now I am the only person to pass on my family name. It sucks even more 'cus I was like one of two people who ever really visited her that she liked. It pisses me off that my family, at least on my mom's side, never really went to my Dad's side. What the fuck! I'm like a member of a dying breed, except it's not the Mohicans, or Siberian Tigers...it's a fucking name. How much does that kick dog shit!?      As unimportant as I feel, I know my grandmother was important to me, and I still love her, which is more than I can say for my feelings toward the rest of my family, who, right now, are on the DEEP AS A MOTHER FUCKER Shit List.      Just 'cus I don't wanna believe in a god that's cruel and let's people be taken from their loved ones and won't stop people from being sick or hurting.      Ah well, seems like it's all fucked. And the only thing I want to do is see the DJ smile...that always made me happy.
