For those of you who have been living under a rock for the last 6 months or so I'll re-cap:  Basically, for every baby born on or after July 1, 2004, the government will give the parent/s $3000. For each baby! A breeding payment so to speak.   Now, besides this just being a political stunt by the Liberal party to stay in power (hey, the election is coming up soon), it's also just plain stupid, ill-conceived, and even more badly executed! The people who would benefit the most from this should be the people who struggle on or below the poverty line, low-income workers, people who can't afford to take maternity leave etc etc etc....  Unfortunately, it's these same people who will get the grant and piss it right up the wall. Not all of them (I'm not going to generalise THAT much), but a fair chunk of them, I'll bet. And the main reason for this? Because they're also the same ones who have, for whatever reasons, little or no education and can't see past their next dole payment. I know quite a number of people who have gotten pregnant so they can get this benefit. And you know the worst thing about it? Most of them are below the age of 18. Yes, we're going to see an influx of teenage mothers and all because the government is run by a bunch of dickheads. I know of one girl already who is planning on buying a TV, stereo, and an Xbox with the money. When asked about what she was going to buy the baby it was replied with: "Nothin'. I'll just use me dole for that shit." And you want to know how old this girl is? 16. Yep. Fucking 16!! Does anyone else see this whole thing is a very bad fucking idea??? Or am I the only one? The people who WILL use it responsibly are the ones who really don't need it. Middle to upper class families. Most of them plan on opening savings accounts etc etc etc.... for their 'precious' kids. And you want to know why? BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED THE FUCKING MONEY IN THE FIRST BLOODY PLACE!!!! If they did they wouldn't be putting it 'away'. They'd be buying prams, cots, diapers, and other shit.  This is all too friggin' wrong!!! Once again, Howard has managed to give his upper-crust wanker mates a hand up while driving the lower classes further into the ground. The most disturbing thing is going to be all the fucked up kids that are going to be reaching adolescence in 15 or so years. Will they be properly educated? Probably not. Will I have to try and teach them? More than likely. Will it be a futile mess? I can almost guarantee it. Will society go even more to shit? Yep, with no brake to stop the out of control vehicle....  Society's fucked people. Get out while you still can.   Lowman X.
