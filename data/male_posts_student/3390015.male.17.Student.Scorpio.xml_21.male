Apparently it's been on for awhile, and I've never seen it until today, the commercials said it's on at 4 during the week I think.  But it's an awesome show!!  Sort of like Punk'd, but a little different premise, these improv actors rip people off in various situations and then the hidden cameras see how long people can keep their cool without leaving or swearing at the actor, once they do, they get nothing, but if the person can keep their cool, they win a Benjamin.
