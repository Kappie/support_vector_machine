It is the California license plate number on John Milner's piss yellow 1932 Ford Coupe (Deuce Coupe) in the 1973 George Lucas classic American Graffiti.  The reason that this is the name of my blog is because I am interested in cars,  urlLink American Graffiti  is one of the best movies ever made, and I couldn't think of anything better.
