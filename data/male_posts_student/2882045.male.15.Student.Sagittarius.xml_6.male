A  SPANISH  poem competition, mind you. Now it didn't take me very long to figure out that I didn't want to do this competition. Problem is, I already told the lady that I'd do it. Great. So all this time, I've told her I'd do it, not because I want to, but because I pitied her and I felt like I was letting her down. So today, we got a test back and I told her that I was disappointed in my grade and that I thought I did better. The following is pretty much the dialogue between us:  me: Aw man, I could've sworn I did better than this knives: Yes, you can do better, but all you care about is  Drama  (Please note that I put that in italics because she made some damn queer motion with her body and hands to accompany her jab at my interests) me (quite offended): Actually, I spent all weekend working on a history outline. knives: Oh,  SORRRRRRRRY!  (ONCE AGAIN SAID QUITE SARCASTICALLY)  At this point, I sat my test down and walked out.  Now I finally have a reason  not  to o the damn competition. How DARE she question my priorities. Personally, her class isn't very high on my list, especially not now. Hell yeah I care more about drama than her stupid competition. Damnit...some people, huh.    Anyways I'm pissed, you don't care, my head is about to split open, and I'm tired as hell. Ciao.
