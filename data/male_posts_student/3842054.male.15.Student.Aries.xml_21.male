Got Guns, Germs and Steel today for AP World History... Fun, Fun, Fun. The whole premise of the book isnt that bad, but the vocab is a bit much, even for the level of schooling im in. If you really want to more info on it (WHICH YOU WONT)... go to www.patty-cake.blogspot.com ... Becca has some kind of bio thing about it. Or just google it.  THe book got me thinking about something though. If we really did evolve from apes... why didnt the apes we have today evolve either... Well, i guess we'll never be able to figure out whether it is evolution or God that brought up these Homo Sapians, but oh well.   AIM isnt working cuz we got rid of AOL today. So now I'm mad. I never use AIM really... but it's nice to have. You never really appreciate what you have until you lose it as some ancient asian dude once said.   I'm watching "The Fuse" right now, some copy of MTv/ VH1 type of thing... mostly music videos, which is cool... but it wont last for long...  Boring day... I want to go to school again... Dreyfoos I miss you... I want to go driving right now. Goodbye.  CHARACTERS OF TODAY Erin: One of my best friends at Dreyfoos. Very Ditzy. Very sweet. Becca: On of my best friends at Dreyfoos. Very Ditzy. Very Sweet. VERY STUBBORN! ( I love you Becca)
