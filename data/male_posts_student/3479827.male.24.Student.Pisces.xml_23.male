The site of mist covered rice fields as far as the eye can see is quite amazing. I tried to take a picture, but my camera couldn't handle the combination of low light and a fast moving train. Other than that, the scenery is very monotonous - when outside of the cities, it's all been flat, boring farmland. We've still got another 2 hours to go :( one thing i forgot to mention in yesterday's log, was the chinese art of queueing, or rather lack of it. If the english have pioneered organised queueing, the chinese have thier own brand of disorganised mobbing. I've noticed this on several occasions. The first was at heathrow airport, they called the first few seats, yet *everyone* got up and jammed the doorway. Next, when the plane landed in beijing, they announced "please remain in your seats with your belts fastened", so everyone immediately stood up and started gathering thier baggage while the plane was still in motion. And yesterday afternoon, getting onto the train platform involved pushing through hordes of other pushing people. I found that if i paused for a moment, i could always feel someone behind me start to push me forwards. My advice to the future china traveller - if you've got seats booked, wait for the mob to go, then leisurely go and take your seat in peace and quiet. Trust me, it works for us :)
