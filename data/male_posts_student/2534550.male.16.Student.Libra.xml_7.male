It is 3 days, 13 hours, 37 minutes and 57 seconds until December 11, 2003, at 7:20:00 PM  Hahaha thought I'd throw that in there...  I'm getting really really really psyched with all this talk of the start of the new BDB season, I miss everyone like crazy! Wow, I can't believe that I'll be with my family again, but it's kinda sad to think of all the changes that are happening...  I, along with Chels and Austin, am a new returning vet, so I have no idea how it feels to come back to half familiar faces and the other half are fresh ones. Actually, if Meehan keeps his word, it will be more like 70% new kids! Hmm, it's almost like being a rookie all over again. Actually, it's not, at all, so I don't know why I just said that...  It's kinda weird thinking about how empty the season's going to feel compared to last year. I think it will be awesome to get in like twice as much rehearsal time by staying at Mars and not having days off for driving and leisure days after coming home, in addition to the minimal rehearsals we get while actually on tour. So that's the good part.  The bad part is not nearly as many shows. Less chances for improvement in the scores. Less chances to beat the Vanguard Cadets. Less chances for Balls of Love.  Oh well, whatever happens, I know it will be awesome, because that's just how we B corps kids do it ;D  Well, since I'm so obsessed with countdowns, here we go:  It is 34 days, 6 hours, 11 minutes and 14 seconds until January 11, 2004, at Noon (Click  urlLink here  to see it yourself)  I think we should all close with the countdown, since we're all feeling a little like Jessika lately =D
