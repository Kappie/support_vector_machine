After all that's done, I'm all for sending him on a one way flight to Baghdad or Kabul.  He can get an eyewitness perspective of the War on Terror for his next cartoon.   It's one thing to disagree with the War on Terror.  It's a totally different ballgame when you sink to the new low (even for liberals) of exploiting and mocking the sacrifice's of brave men, like Tillman, simply to score political points in an election year.  Politics in this country need to stop at the waters edge.  Our national security and is far too important to be left up to partisan mudslinging.
