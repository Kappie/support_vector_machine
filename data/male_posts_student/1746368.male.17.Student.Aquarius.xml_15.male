Saturday I didn't because I was doing about a million things that day. Maybe it was two things, I can exxagerate all I want. Anyways, I went to help one of my friends with something on Saturday morning. I worked the sound while she was teaching a few other people a dance they will be performing some Sunday morning. I don't know when they are doing it.   That night I had a birthday party I was going to. It was pretty fun. Well, now I have nothing really to say. I thought I would need to say a lot more things, but I was sadly mistaken. Bye all, have a great day.
