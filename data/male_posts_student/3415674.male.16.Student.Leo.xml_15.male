I was having trouble writing things because I couldent really find a good subject, so I wrote about a relationship I was in this year and wrote about the better points of it and this is what came out, from the heart... It doesn't really hold any truth to how I feel, mabye a little but it doesn't matter now, I just used it to get something out on paper mostly, there was another small part but I took it out and I'm going to change it].   The moon glows so much With teardrops in my eyes So I’ll close them tight and imagine you’re here with me Everything felt so right  Do you remember last December? Walking in the cold and rain didn’t matter cause you were worth it Everyone was cheerful for the holidays And you were with me It was all I could ever ask for But you’ve passed just like the season has And all I have now are the gifts that seem so priceless Cause you’ve passed just like the season And now I wait for what seems so long  for you to come back around.   [This is the part I took out, needs changing though] The moon still glows brightly but it looks so alone untill it turns on its axis and sees what has been missing.  [and mabye some chorus lines would be good too.]
