Well the answer is simple ... there is a new branch of the help desk here in the library and I am working here today.  From 1 until 7.  It feels like monday (i guess becuase I have been off for 2 days and the real Monday was a holiday).  I had a nice weekend.  Went to Atlanta just to get away and to take David to see the Armorettes show.  Now the show is in a gay bar ... and you generally have to be 21 to get in there ... but David is only 20 and looks maybe 15 (something which I certainly like but that does not help when trying to get in such places).  So we met up with my of my friends (an armorett [forgive me for not being able to spell]) and helped him/her carry stuff in so that the door man would not question David's age.  It worked like a charm.  He loved the show (and I knew he would).  The only bad part about the whole weekend was the very long drive to and from atlanta.  David has been dealing with a guy he knows from cola for a while.  They are supposed to go to Las Vegas together to learn about some business stuff.  The guy is being a totaly jerk about some things tho.  I am not going to go into any real detail here because it's David's private life and not my place to talk about it much "in public", but I am going to comment in how it is affecting me.  First it's upsetting David some and I don't like that in the slightest.  Second I don't really want him to go for my own selfish reasons.  Third David is having to make the decision to go or not to and it's stressing him out.  He wants to go to learn the stuff, but is not sure about going with this guy.  Even tho I don't really want him to go ... I don't want him to always wonder what he missed if he didn't go.  I am completely trying to stay out of the decision and to be objective for him by pointing out the good and bad points of both going and staying.  It is of course his decision alone to make and I will support him either way he goes.  I will just be very glad when this whole thing is behind us.  ... and I hope I don't have to break the legs of that guy in cola ... cuz if he hurts David .... grrrr
