Props go out to Bob for setting this thing up for us!!!  Today was Christmas Day and I rolled out of bed at the crack of dawn (coughcough2PMcoughcough) as usual. Dinner...errrr I mean breakfast...was already being cooked. I gave my parents a $50 gift certificate to the Outback. I think my dad seemed pretty thrilled by the thought of free food. My mom comes up to me and tells me that I she got me a new car. I almost hit the floor when I heard that, but disappointment soon followed when she hands me a stupid fucking piece of chocolate resembling a car. What the fuck!!!  However, my parents were nice enough to buy me a wireless router so I can hook my own computer up in my room. That means my little brother can jerk off all he wants using the family computer, and I don't have to touch the mouse and keyboard anymore! Woot! I tried setting up the router earlier today but I found out that I'm missing an ethernet wire. That means I'm off to Radioshack first thing tomorrow...  Oh yeah, one more thing. Tuesday night everyone got super blazed off of Bob's brand new bong. When I went home blazed off my ass, I was convinced that all the appliances in the house were watching my every move. I laid on my bed in terror, staring at my TV set and satellite reciever. It was definately the worst trip I've ever had, ever. Don't smoke pot, kids!  -BIGsmut.
