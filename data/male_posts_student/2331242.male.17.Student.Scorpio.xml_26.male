Blah blah small criticizms etc...   Just yesterday I was venting my rage at the man, and today he turns our test into our class drawing a poster and hands me an  A . Upon discovering my grade,  urlLink Conner  promptly attacked me with several inanimate objects. I looked at my quarter grades as well.  Q1: B- Q2: B- Exam: A- Sem1: B  Wow. That's four whole points on my GPA with the AP added in. Rock on! I just don't know what to think about the man now. It seems that only when my thinking coincides with his that my grades go up. Or maybe I really am improving. It's too early to tell. But you haven't seen the last of *theme music*   JD MILLS, TEACHER SLAYER!   Rachel pointed out that I was a little harsh in my rant yesterday. I know I was harsh, but I'm not trying to make the man hang himself or anything. The greatest thing about blogs is that they're self-therapeutic. I just had a  lot  of hot air that I needed to let out. You also made some good points that I hadn't considered, but will keep in mind in the future.  Martha had D-Hall today, the first of two. Those things are  not  fun. I think I've had... hmmm.... maybe 3 or 4 over my highschool career, 2 of which have been on the new system. You have to sit and stare literally at the wall for an hour. You can't do anything else. Not even homework.  We got in trouble with the Sturgesses this Monday, we got there like a full 50 minutes after I had promised we would. Mrs. Sturgess sent my dad an email about curfews. He gave me a lecture, but wasn't at all mad or anything. Let's just hope it ain't one of those days for my mother when she finds out. Martha might get some of her priveleges taken away. Let's hope she can at least go to sweet 16 next week.  Luv ya Martha, good luck with everything :)  Oh yeah, and on yet another sad note, my friend Mike at Moment of Clarity has written the final chapter of his blog. Click his link on the right menu bar over there and be stunned. Just make sure your legal gaurdian or any other adults aren't around.
