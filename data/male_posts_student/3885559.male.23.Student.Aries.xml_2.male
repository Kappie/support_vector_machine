Eat I mean, not that I had too much of a choice near the campus, but coz people think too much about the choices they have.Having resolved to eat only low-carb, high protein diet....since morning,I settled on SUBWAY.   I was ushered in with a wide glee and the widely accepted way of saying, "What the heck do u want?","How may I help you,Sir?" Like always I said,"I will have a chicken teriyaki,please", spat came a response,"why does everyone have Chicken Teriyaki," which set me thinking,why? Is it because of the chicken that tastes like everything or the teriyaki sauce which I have never liked anyway, or is it because of the veggies that u stuff in there, yeah right, who am I kidding.May be its the South West dressing,but thats just me, why do lots of people like it.I concluded that the answer should lie between the chicken and the teriyaki. All this time I did'nt even notice that I had gobbled down the foot of bread. When I got back to my lab, I asked one of the consultants in my lab,"Hey Phil,do you like the chicken teriyaki at the SUBWAY",he smiled,coz he is a kind of a smiler and said, "sure as hell man,who doesnt?" "But Why,why do people like it," the reply sent me back to thinking about password protecting a page in that goddamn server,it was, "Who is John Galt."
