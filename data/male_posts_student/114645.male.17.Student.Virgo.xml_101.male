He is just like he is at HowardDean.tv. He was right to the point and said that as President he wouldn't send Nuclear Waste to Nevada if the science wasn't right. Oh yea! Anywho. Sorry, I'm just a little happy at the fact that I could have just met the future President of the United States and shook his hand!
