Well, of course, that is leaving out the damn 7 essays that are left for me to complete, the PW stuff and man oh man, CO stuff...  Heh heh, at least now though, i am leading a happier and more light hearted life. Certainly i know that some people view me cruel, emotionless and i guess, heartless. However, i guess to these people, i know where there are are coming from, but i just hope that they understand all that's going on 1st before judging me... yup...  Anyway, the thing is that, though i am not really absolutely happy with the decision i made, i certainly am glad that i made it now. i have no regrets cause, at least, i do know at the moment more or less, the decision that it's heading towards. So yeah...  Well, the decision has left me happy cause at least, for this relationship or at least, somewhat like it, everything is transparent and honest. yeah, it makes it much easier for everything and i am thankful for that. Hmm... oh well, anyway, there are some things that she said that really made my day and though i met some troubles and stuff, in the end, it's what she said that kept my spirits high! heex...  Ok, anyway, i shouldn't be saying so much right? Yup, i guess, i've also finally made the decision to step down as Class Representative, too much stress, too much problems with school work and CCA, so yeah. To friends and pals that have been supportive to me throughout that period where i was the Clas Representative, THANKS! I'll still be continuing my job for the period till they choose a new one. But yeah, i won't say it was really enjoyable but it sure had it's ups and downs lah.  However, i do know at least that at my side, there will always be someone that i can rely on. That is God! Yup, He who has made my life beautiful by showering me with many blessing such as blessing me with knowing Kelly and Cherie. Yup...  So to all out there! Trust in the Lord you God, and lean not on your own understanding! heex... Take care ok everyone?! Especially to Cherie, do take care of yourself! You ah! Hurt your leg! Please take care ok? If you need anything, i am always here! Smile everyone! :p
