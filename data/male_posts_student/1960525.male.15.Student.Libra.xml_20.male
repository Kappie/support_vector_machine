However, when I DO find something that makes me frustrated, you seem to dismiss it thinking it should go straight into my personal blog. This in itself makes me angry, and I rarely get mad. If the blog is here for our thoughts and feelings, then I will use it to any extent I wish. Unless you and Jesse veto my update. Then I will get rid of it.  Two things. 1. Its raining, so therefore I am happy 2. Some guy came into our school and we had to go into lock-down mode! It rawkd!  END!!!!
