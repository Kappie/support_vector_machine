I have to go places today, because I won't have time between the time I get back from Yearbook Camp and the time that I leave for the New York state.  I'm just gonna have to live with it, I guess, because it is absolutely crucial that I get this done before I leave the Blogger.      Nerdular Nerdance: The July Edition is coming!  It's in the planning stages.  It'll cover Sunday night and Thursday night's posts.  If you haven't guessed, it's going to be about Yearbook camp.  That's right.  All of the audio posts that I do (if I do any, I'm still unsure as to whether or not I can pull it off), all of the pictures that are posted, and all of the other stuff that I post.      Anywho.  I still haven't received any Gmail invites yet... but, I'm hoping to have some by August 9th, because that is the day that I want to begin the contest.  Remember, in order to win, you have to look across Blog of Bagel, Digital Lust, and the new blog (coming August 9th) for the secret codes, which will be hidden in comments and sometimes even the posts themselves (yeah, that's right, I can edit them).  Email the code to my Gmail account, and you're put in a drawing for the daily Gmail account giveaway.  I really want to get this thing started by August 9th, so hopefully while I am in Orlando, I'll receive my invites, and you guys can start getting them when I get back from the New York State.    We had a pretty bad storm up here last night, which is why I never got around to making fun of other peoples' blogs.  Doesn't that suck?  The power was out for a while, and then it took longer for the satellite to reconnect, leaving me... INTERWEBLESS!    Yea, that is definitely a bad thing.  Interwebless means that I have nothing to do, sending me into a state of Absolute Boredism, which therefore sends me into confusion because I can't post about how bored I am!  Yea, I'm crazy, and if it took you that long to figure that one out, you lose 5 bagel points.  Sorry.      Digital Lust is all new today.  I'm going to give a sneak preview of what is to come today, and in August, we officially launch the new site.  It's going to be more gaming oriented, but, with the occasional throw-in of the rest of the stuff that I have become famous for posting for.  The Google search thing is awesome...I'm now on teh G00g13!  Yeah, I was the last listing, but, that's okay, I s'pose.  I have an article going up today on the Sony PSP vs. the Nintendo DS, which is going to be rather lengthy and interesting, so read it, if you're a nerd like me.    Anyone seen that movie School of Rock?  It's my absolute favoritest movie of all time, with the exception of Spiderman 2.  Jack Black is without doubt one of the funniest actors of all time, and putting him in the position of a substitute teacher was one of the best decisions that they could make, especially with his musical background.  I can't wait to see what kind of changes he'll make to the upcoming King Kong remake (if you haven't heard, he IS the star of it, and it will be in theaters December 2005).  I have a feeling that it will be more comedy than what it used to be.  The only thing I'm worried about, is, what will they use in place of the WTC scene, where King Kong is up at the top (from the 1970-whatever version)?  Will they go back to the Empire State Building, like in the original movie?  Or, will they use the WTC in hopes that they won't get flamed?  Or, will they even use the new WTC which started construction last week?  Doubt that one, but, you never know with these movie crews.    Well now, that's about it for today's morning update.  After a nice, long post, my allergies are starting to clear up already.  Isn't that great?  Detect sarcasm, get the 5 bagel points you probably lost a few minutes ago when reading above.  Later on today, I'll have one final camp story before we head into Nerdular Nerdance mode, plus, the all new, revamped Late Night Bloggin'.  For now, go check out Digital Lust in about half an hour for the first new feature that I'll have on board.  We're going to have two posts there today, and each one will have something that you eren't expecting!  I'll be back here later on.
