So here it is:  Peer Pressure  While sitting in Cost Cutters today, I noticed a guy wearing an Ecko.complex shirt.  I was looking at him mostly because he had this nasty grin.  I was pretty bored so I started to think about that a bit.  Why is he wearing this shirt, I was thinking.  There are several reasons why he could have chosen the shirt.  Overwhelmingly I think most of the time it’s just the fact that everyone wears x brand.  The second could be that he simply likes that style or simply that he likes the comfort.  Possibly both.  What I’m ranting about is that sometimes people just don’t care to spend loads of money on expensive brands simply to show off or for other reasons similar.  I personally would wear just about anything as long as it’s comfortable, it doesn’t look too bad, and that it doesn’t have a huge label on it saying what brand it is.  Let’s take a step back here though.  If you see someone wearing xy brand from Wal-Mart and another person wearing the most expensive yz brand, you’re going to think differently of them no matter what you think.  I would honestly say that I would too.  That’s the problem we have at hand.  The amount of peer pressure is amazing.  Automatically if you don’t have something everyone else has, you’re an outcast.  That’s been going on for as long as anyone can remember.  Most parents could probably tell you a million stories on how Suzy had to have the latest shoes or she would be a reject.  It’s pretty much just a cycle to them.  Make the product a variable and the cost of it a variable as well.  Parents take a different approach.  They only look at the cost part.  They hold this approach rightfully.  They work for the money; they should be able to choose on what it’s spent.  The problem is the various industries are taking advantage of this peer pressure and jacking up the prices on their products.  No one cares.  They’ll still buy it.  If we go further, we’ll boil it all down to money.  Who has more is liked more who doesn’t is not.  The question I leave you with is this: is it possible to be liked without money?  Can character somehow be the standard like it was a long time ago?  That's it.  Give me some comments and I'll be happy.  Good night.
