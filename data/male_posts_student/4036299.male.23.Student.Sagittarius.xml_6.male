The amusing part comes from the amount spent on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (or "The FERC", which sounds more appropriately ominous).  Any guesses as to how much money the DOE gives to FERC?  The answer: 0.  That's right.  DOE gives roughly $8 billion dollars to weapons research, and zip to the guys who have (arguably) the most influence on how much power costs in your home, and how to prevent things like blackouts.  This is why FERC can only hire starting engineers at  urlLink $38000 , whereas the national average starting salary for electrical engineers is around  urlLink $50000  (it's the 3rd most lucrative degree available).   It's pretty sad that such a potentially meaningful job has such poor salaries...and might explain some of the ill-thought-out work ( urlLink SMD , anyone?) they produce.
