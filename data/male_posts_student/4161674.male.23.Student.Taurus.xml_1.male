I've been a friend of Gizmonic Guy and his 'Groovy Gizmonic Gang' for some 7 years now and I must say that it is an honor to be invited to be a part of their 'blog group'!  I'm certain that Mr. E. was anticipating my first foray into the wonderful world of blogging to be some sort of treatise on one of the obscure horror movies I enjoyed in my youth, a recollection of all the wonderful local-origination TV programs I grew up with in the Cleveland viewing area (thanks again for the book about Cleveland TV, Giz Guy!), a dissertation on the finer points of the musical output of Christian rock group Daniel Amos, or perhaps even an intricate look at my fascinating life-long hobby of lint-collecting.  ...But NOOOOOOOO!  Instead you're stuck with me being all 'serious-like' and 'deep' right off the bat!  Fear not, though.   This will not be some long-winded meditation.  I just wanted to share a DEEP THOUGHT that occurred to me tonight.  ...And I shall be brief!  For those of you who don't know me, I work for a local television news operation.  And in that capacity, I am occasionally called upon to produce a 'promo' for the newscast.  Well, I have to tell you that INITIALLY I always approach such assignments with much fear and loathing.  I mean REALLY...how do you make a newcast - especially a LOCAL one - seem exciting?!?  Well, I'll guarantee you...it ain't always easy!  But I find that no matter how much I may dread the task when it first comes my way, I always find that creative 'spark' eventually.  - And once I DO, I'm off and running.  Now don't misunderstand me here.  I'm not talking about my work as if it were some great masterpiece.  ..."Gone With The Wind" it ain't!  Shoot, it's not even "Scream Of The Wolf" (see below)!  But I find that the creative process makes me 'come alive' like nothing else!    Some artists work in the medium of music.  Others put their thoughts down on a canvas.  Some put their heart into a piece of pottery as it is molded on the potters' wheel.  Me...I like to shoot and edit video!  If I look back at my past, I honestly have to say that some of the happiest moments in my life came when I was involved in something creative!  For example, a friend of mine who works in local radio, Lee J., has collaborated with me on several video productions.  The first one was a project for my class at J.C.C.  The second was for a comedy show Lee was putting together to perform at the 'Reg'.    Both of those incidents found me feeling so 'up' and happy, it was like I was off on a week-long 'bender' each time!  The process of coming up with an idea, shooting the various elements needed to put that idea into action, and then editing the raw footage into a linear story-arc - and ultimately seeing your idea played out on a video screen just gets me so pumped up!  (OK, OK...I know I'm weird!)  But wait...here's where the DEEP THOUGHT kicks in.  (You thought it would never get here, right?!?)  I imagine that that's one of the reasons God loves us so much.  Stay with me here.  ...Think about it.  - In the process of creation, He's made something from nothing.  From nothingness, He created a complete Universe - one full of galaxies, solar systems, planets, animals, micro-organisms, plants, and people.  And he even created YOU.  Not by any random chance did the molecules and cells of your body come together to form the unique creature that is YOU!  (I don't care WHAT the Darwinists try to tell you!)  God must look at his creation and feel the same 'high' that I do upon finishing a creative project - only on a level at least a MILLION times more intense, of course!  - It's that feeling of satisfaction, you know?  You've put a lot of creative thought and hard work into your project - whether it be a video production, a piece of pottery, a musical composition, or in THIS case, a real live human being.  God is immensely satisfied with his creation.  He said it Himself in Genesis 1:31 - at the end of the Creation story - "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."  God loves me!  ...And God loves you!  Don't ever forget it!!!
