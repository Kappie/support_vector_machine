Gotta have a quick scene in there with that housekeeping bitch walking out and Mackey following here zipping up his pants. That's A+ material. Here's my sorry attempt at screenwriting:   First Scene: We open with a shot of an orientation video as we roll the opening credits. Some cheesy looking low paid Troy McLure type walks into frame and gently announces:   "Hi there, and welcome to the Prominence Hotel. As part the elite team here at this fine establishment, you will be responsible for creating an atmosphere of unparalleled hospitality, and top-notch service."  The video goes on to display the fine hotel exterior, acted examples of customer service, the usual shit. Crazy music cues in as screen goes to black and the titled is displayed:                                                                  PROMINENCE HOTEL  Second Scene: It's the end of the day, and third shift is about to take over. Fred, the nighttime security guy is walking down the halogen lit halways in the employee section of the hotel, holding a SEARS catalog and whistling. He gets to the employee EXIT doors to lock them, and takes one look outside, he sees nothing, but he hears talking and some laughter, and he smells something funny. He decides to investigate. Meanwhile, Basil, Todd, Hugo and Roger are standing next to Todd's truck smoking weed.   FRED: Hey guys, how ya doing?   TODD: (Quickly, yet clumsily tries to hide the bowl) H..Hey man, what's up?  FRED: Oh, not much, not much you know, just doing my rounds you know. Just checking to make sure you're not a bunch of hooligans, you know, just can't be too carefull these days, you know.   BASIL: (Giggling like a little girl) Hey, man, did anyone ever tell you you're like...Matlock on speed. You're like straight outta the fucking fifties man, with that haircut and shit!!!  FRED: (Puzzled..) Matlock, oh yeah, that's a great show you know, well, hey just thought I'd check up on you guys, make sure all is well, ok. Well, you know....g'nite!  Fred leaves, and everyone is quiet until he gets back in the hotel.   TODD: Basil, you fucking moron, are trying to get us fired or what?  BASIL: Relax man, Fred's a fucking retard. (He tosses his cigarette, and takes out another one.)  HUGO: Dude, you just put out a cigarette man!  BASIL: Oh.....Oh yeah. Hey man, you got a light?  Scene 3: Blackout screen, fade to six in the morning.    Oh, man I'm stumped. Todd, give me some ideas man!!!!
