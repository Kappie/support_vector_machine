I went down stairs to the lovely sound of court shows echoing throughout the hallways. I then preceeded to get turn on my computer when long behold it wouldn't start so I had to format my hard drive and start all over and estonishingly that was the most interesting part of my day. I got online and knowone was online. So I turned on my t.v and nothing was on. Not a good time for me so I went down stairs and got the chinese food out of the fridge fortune cookies and all and then I came up stairs and watched Finding Nemo on my computer. Its probably not good that I have a laptop because me laying down just gets me tired and even more tired so eventually I just fell asleep. About 4 hours later I woke up to the sound of Marlin yelling at Dory on the DVD title menu so I shut it off and went back to sleep for another 30 min. So I wake up to the sound of music playing in my house and long behold this is my current state I haven't even turned on my light yet. And I just realized that life without a car sucks.
