I went out to nick's apartment around 11:30pm on Saturday night and had some beer drinking fun with those fellas. Lots of fun people were there - we talked and jumped around for a while - watched two movies (falling down and the attic expeditions.) Very good movies, on the second movie, I had finished off more beer than I needed to and stumbled awkwardly around the living room. Good thing I didn't fall into a window.  After the movies, most of the people left. nick, jason, and i stayed out on the porch till close to 5am talking about our ideas about god and christianity and every other deity-centric cult.  The next day, or afternoon, we all went to denny's - had some food and started to move nick's large pieces of belongings to his new house in dallas. We go done with all that around 6:30pm and I was ready to get in the shower. I sweated so much - damn beer.  Got home, cleaned up and went to deliver the 7" comp to the ...Of Death kids and Terms of Grey. I was so tired and hungry, I just stopped by, said hello to a few people i recognized, and took off to get some food with mimi.  After dinner, my wife and I went home and crashed out. What a tired soul I was....   current mood: working current music: pinback
