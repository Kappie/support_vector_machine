Like im jus exhausted from all of the drillz and linez we do and jus tired. I can barely jump, and my armz r kinda weak...so i jus need to take it easy. well todayz practice was pretty good, we watched the video of sante fe and los altos play. personally, i think theyre not that good, they have one good outside but hez no eric vance...i mean, vance and fuckin pound the shit out of the ball, but this guy jus hitz the spotz and the rest of the team was jus like "alright". los altos though sucked ass, so i believe we could take them to 3 gamez. Our passing was very good today, suprisingly...so yeah john, alfred, and dan came, so it was coo. Tomorrow is a day that we should dominate...ive been to the quarterfinalz before, we started off wit a win in the 1st game, but it jus went downhill from there. If our passing is jus dead on tomorrow, it would b jus a cake walk. This year, after playin 2 seasons of club, that we could make history and go to the semifinalz and possibly to the finalz...so, its jus up to us...payce.
