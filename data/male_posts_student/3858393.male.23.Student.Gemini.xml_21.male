I'm bored... In Jadakiss's song Why... WHY(hehe why I used the name of the song) does he say "Why did Bush knock down the towers" He didn't knock down the towers... Dumbass... It's a good song, but that line was retarded... Noone listens to me on this blog... I'm writing to myself... O.k. I'm gonna go eat! CyA... Signed, Jimmy
