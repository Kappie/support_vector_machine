I think Lutherans call them seminarians too, at least the ones in the US. Schedule sounds rough, A. I know what you mean about the creature comforts though.  All my friends think I'm crazy for living at home next spring when I'm interning in Chicago. Same situation--hour and a half on the train, early mornings, late nights. They told me to expect 80 hours per week. But with mom doing the cooking and the laundry (when I'm home to eat or get clothes washed, that is) how can you go wrong? It's just too expensive to live in Chicago, although not as expensive as London, I think. Well, just finished a helluva week, with 2 exams, an essay due, a corporate tax return due, etc. I've been boozing all night on Strongbow cider and Coronas, I've had my IHOP (International House of Pancakes), and now I'm ready for bed.     Ciao,  Tim
