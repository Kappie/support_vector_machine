Luckily, there is one question that might help me boost my marks so that I can maintain my record. Before that, I received back my  Moral  paper too. Got an  80  for it. Not bad, she counted  86  at first... haha... she's so kind to me.   ~ Then, during  Science , we discussed the objective paper. I got a  42  out of  50  which is good enough for me. I remember that I got  35  out of  50  for the objective paper during Mid-year examination. After that, it was time for  Commerce . As usual, we marked our objective papers as well. I got  30  out of  40 , which is fairly good. My  Commerce  isn't that good, but the score did improve compared to the last exam where I got  28 . Finally, it was time for  English . I got  91  for the paper. It was a shock. I thought I would only get  85 - 88  for it.   Tomorrow will be my dooms day, with  History ,  Additional Maths ,  Malay  and  Basic Economics . I'm not really confident in thsoe subjects. But as far as I'm concern, there's always Trial II.
