Where is the Fighting Crimson? Or the Crimson Yeomen? Or the Fighting Farming Yeomen, or whatever the hell we're called? We didn't win a football game for four years, and then when we did we rushed the field (all 26 of us in attendance) and ripped down the goalposts. At least, I think that's what we did. That might have been a myth, an urban legend if you will. But I'd like to think we did that.
