      Well, though I'd like to use some of your job-quitting tactics, I'll just be typing up a nice, semi-heartfelt letter of resignation.  Two weeks from this Saturday, I'll be packing up and moving to Naples.  It looks like I'll be staying with my family in their new house for a month or so until I get settled in, get some money saved, and find my own place.  I'll be working at the  urlLink David Lawrence Center , as a Behavior Technician.  I'm not completely sure if I'll be attending school in the fall, or wait until the spring when I'll be more settled in and secure.  I got real lucky, this was the second job I applied for, and the first that I interviewed for, and it is the one I really wanted.  I'm waiting to feel all sentimental about leaving Lake City, but it doesn't seem to be happening.  This is what I've been waiting for.  It looks like I'll be having a couple of "parties," so Glenn, let me know again when you are planning to be in town, so we can all get together.  Maybe go bowling, eat dinner.  Your treat, right? :p    Went to the porch to have a thought, got to the door and again I couldn't stop.
