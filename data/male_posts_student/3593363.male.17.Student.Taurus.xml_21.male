Then we went to mcdonalds then I took David home, picked Heather up and we all went swimming in Aarons Pool. Then we went to Taco Bell. I like Tacos more then Heather, and she don't know anything if she goes around sayin somethin else. Thne we screwed around at Aarons. Nothing too emotional, except i feel bad for Lindsey. So... Goodnight.
