I know you’ve heard it before But the only thing I got going for me is you  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away  So go ahead and overlook me I am not to be recognized But at least you gave me the second glance Recall us now, cause you never believed in second chances I can stay this way forever I can, but would this make it better if I did? What do I need to prove? I know you’ve read this note before But the only person I’d give my heart to is you  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)  Let me give you a dozen roses Let me give you a dozen years I’d give you all the time you needed But that could never justify these tears  I can pretend that I don’t notice you pretending I can act like I believe every word you say I’ve been holding my breath so I won’t take in your air It’s intoxicating, I just need to get away Just let me get away (x3)
