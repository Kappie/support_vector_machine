AS USUAL Gay Idol had broken his PC so i had to fix it - i leaft them at 11.45 with instructuions no how to do it - shoulda been ok.  and then i'm told Miss Strawberry has some Strawberry body cream she wants some taste testing done on...so i guess i'd better ablige - dont want to be rude...  but today was so great cos of the lack of alcohol in the park - everyone was having fun and being relaxed and normal with any drink at all! reminded me of the old days - really great.
