So I know I am not, but I am starting to get this feeling that I have not had in a long time. (probably since last summer.)  I once again am feeling...like a void to people and am jsut a fourth wheel. Even when I am sitting alone in my room. When I seem to be in big groups I tend to feel left out, when I am with small groups I feel left out, when (rarely though) I am just with one other person I feel left out.  I want to know why these feelings are returning. I have not done much to anyone to feel like this. I want to be accepted for just who I am. (I know it dose not make sense)  Exampe: Meh best bro Theo and I will be together...and then we meet other folk and I am left out again. I know it is not intentional. It just....happens. I also seem to fall in the middle of things alot. (once again not on purpose.)  Sometimes I just want to be with a person and just not have the other person wonder off about "I wonder what they are doing?"  or even wonder off myself about Rhae. I think about her alot and I am not afraid to say it. I just...Don't know what I want. I know for sure though that Rhae is the person for me. I just wonder sometimes if she feels the same. It is kinda hard to tell, eventhough that is the type of person she is. That is also one thing that  attracts mw too her is the fact that she treats me nice like that and  like a person, not an object for her to pick up and use as she likes...  Well that is my current thoughts is the shear fact that  I feel depressed (again)  and like a dementor suck up all the happy from other people. ( And the fact that my sister is pissn' me off again.
