Because Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are very well made movies. They're made so well that even if you hate the movie, after you see it you will enjoy it. I hate both, because;  a)  The Neverending Story  was shorter. b) Wizards, talking trees, massive computer generated wars, there is only so much I can take. c) Harry Potter, written by some homeless dyke mom who is a good writer, was created to be read to her little kids.  The books got published, and somehow it was not only little kids who read the little kids books. Now she's really rich.  If Harry Potter is your thing, then, whatever, but something's not right when you try to act uber mature and then you go put your wizard hat on to catch the first release at 1:30 AM. It's just not possible.   I would rather see someone get stabbed through their temples, or better yet,  I  would rather stab  myself  through the temples than watch someone who hasn't hit puberty go to a fictional school (HP). Also, I don't know much about Harry Potter, but they all talk like they're from the UK, and I detest the UK. It's just not possible.   The only thing I hate more than Harry Potter are the retarded parents who tried to  BAN  the book! OMG! He's casting a spell, call the pope.  The whole thing is messed up, you have university graduates reaching climax at the thought of seeing the new movie, and you have parents trying to ban a childrens book!  It's just not not not possible.  Lord of the Rings on the other hand is okay. I finally watched the first one, and it was not bad. Yes, that's right, everyone who tried to get me to see the movie but I refused, there you have it. I might actually consider it a great movie if a third of the characters weren't  the gayest things anyone could come up with, ever . Overall though, LOTR is okay, but Harry Potter...Come on...  Salut, Sean
