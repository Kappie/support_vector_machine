Thats not entertaining to me. It's just a constant reminder that T.V producers have run out of good ideas. It might be a tough job to come up with something original, but when you just have a few families to compete to see which  should get their own show, thats just not trying. hey! I just had a thought! * people in shock *  how about just having people tell producers what they want to see? so that way you people in the T.V buisness don't have to rack you're brains to think of something entertaining. Here's another idea!  *more shock *   Don't be afraid to put more money into something that people want to see. You're gonna get that money back from the raitings aren't you? If no one wants to be on you're show, tell them to go to hell! Then do some open casting. Just don't make another crappy show about it! Now to tell off those who want to be movie stars. If you're an aspiring actor, be a GOOD actor!!!!
