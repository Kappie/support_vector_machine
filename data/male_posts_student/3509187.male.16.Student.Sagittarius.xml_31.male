This afternoon, Most of Untitled met and it was pretty good. I'd have to say, Untitled's future is looking pretty bright. August 1 we have a gig in Pine Grove Mills...  So what else today? well today isn't over, but I'll let you know how the first part went...  I woke up nice and early (accually too early, my clock was an hour fast and freaked me out).  I went into town with my mom who works at the Public Library.  I read Mad Mag until like 10:45 and then went to Music Mart where I happened to see Miss Margret Byron.  Then to Quiznos to get a sub with a cupon (I'm such a cheapskate).  Then back to the Library.  My mom took me to Erics House to jam witht Untitled. On our way out I saw Noah.  Eric drove me back tot he Library at about 2:15.  I drove us home and while stopped at at a light, I saw Mr. Patrick Powers in the parking lot of Harner's.    I'm heading out soon to the wander town, a movie, and some food for a Super Awesome Fun Day with some gym conrads...  Until later tonight...  -Dan V
