Anyways, I never did end up going to Knott's, just ended up stopping by the McDonald's with the locked DDR 8th Mix machine with my family since they were hungry.  I wasted about 5 bucks playing.  And then I kinda didn't do much for awhile.  I did update my site in the meantime though, with what me and my friends would look like if we were in South Park.  Pretty cool, check it out.  Anyways, so I did go somewhere.  I went to Disneyland.  Wasn't bad.  Though everything was like closed.  I went on Haunted Mansion and PotC mostly.  Did some other rides but yah....  I did somehow end up in Tomorrowland (nothing-is-open land) and rode the Autopia.  Which I will  NEVER  do again.  Ever.  It was like the 405...except like..worse.  Anyways, I decided to play some DDR while I was there, since Disneyland's 8th Mix machine is fully unlocked.  Played Sakura on standard for the first time...and passed it with a B!  So my skill level is now 8 feet (which is Exorbititant, or something).  So that's cool.  I'm still kinda sore from it.  I tried playing Blonde Girl on heavy RIGHT after it, and failed miserably....I was sooo tired after that.  But I ended up playin Sakura 6 more times that day...and I didn't bar rape.  Hahahaha I rock [\sarcasm].  But yah...some other players showed up too, so we talked...they've been playing for 2 years and were pretty amazed that I'm up to 8 feet in 5 months.  And then there were some "townies" which ugh...I can't stand.  And some stupid kid thought he could shadow me without asking.  Wrong.  And then I had some girls who wanted to take pics of me while I played...that was kinda fun.  I don't know  why  they wanted to take photos, but hey, who knows.  Lots of people gathered round to watch me play Sakura...I might have to take that song up as my next song to dance whore.....  Anyways..tired.  So...bye.
