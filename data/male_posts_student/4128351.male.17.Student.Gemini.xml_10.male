She hasn't talked to me in two days, and she asks me a dumb question like that... how pitiful.  She knows I would care.  I quit.        Oh well, I better give you a boring recap of the past two days.  I stayed up til' 5 AM burning CD's for Jamin, well into Sunday morning.  I woke up three hours later and struggled through church and youth.  Then, my family went to Dairy Queen.  Me and Brice discovered waffle fries.        I came home, got Jamin's CD's, and was right out the door to his cookout.  I ate two hotdogs and a hamburger and then gave him his present.  He gave me a Kerry/Edwards sign.  I'm going to miss that douchebag, he's like the best friend I have... but don't have.  It's really messed up.  Hopefully I can go down and visit him in September.        From Jamin's cookout, I came home and hauled my room from upstairs to the loft above the garage.  It's basically like a mini-apartment, nobody bugs me.  I havn't finished it yet, but I'm working on it.  Mom and Dad were pissed, but they'll get over it.  I did laundry and downloaded CD's from Levi, and then I took and shower and went to Jami's to stay the night.      I love her so much, she melts my heart.  Just lying with her in my arms, it kills me, it reallys does.  I swear to you, I could die and I wouldn't notice... yes, it's  that  nice.  I love you, Jami.      Anyway, we woke up this morning and took showers and met the group at McDonald's (started by Ray Kroc in 1956).  I fell asleep in Butch's van with a girl's head on my shoulder; not Jami's but Meanaaaen's (or something like that).  I had a really good time at King's Island, except for one small thing: I don't fit in with her friends.  I don't know if they don't like me, or they're just too concerned about themselves.  I  know  that atleast one of them thinks they're better than me.  I don't care, you know.  I'm  me .  I don't want to be anyone else, you don't have to go out of your way to make yourself feel better, smarter, more distinguished.  Just stop, please.        I wish Jamin were here, he'd say it for me: "Fuck the stupid yuppies"      At King's Island, we rode White Water Canyon like three times until all of us were soaked.  It was a blast.  Then, me and Jami fell asleep and just did nothing.  It was fun.  We left then.        Anyway, we came back to Jami's and I whined and wasted all of our alone time.  I'm sorry, I really am.  I won't do it again.  I was with you for over 24 hours and I miss you already.  I love you, baby.      Eh, right now I'm burning a copy of Guster's  Parachute  because I tried listening to it in the car and my CD is worn out or something, it wouldn't play.  It really sucked.        Tomorrow I have no idea what is going on.  My parents didn't speak to me and I don't know if I have a car or not.  I don't know anything.  So, I'm going to set my alarm for about nine and see what happens.  I hope I make it.        I'm so in love with you it's not funny.      Keep cool my douche bags, I'm going to sleep.  And to the people I don't like: "Kiss my ass, you pansy motherfuckers".  There, now I feel better, Tuesday.  ;)
