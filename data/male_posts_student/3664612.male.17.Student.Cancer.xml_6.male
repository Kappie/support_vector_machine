Now i know the news is pretty old but its just a way to tell the Lakers fans out there that your team sucks dicks.  First of all the reason why i hate the Lakers is that they are a one dimensional team. Since they believe that buying every good player in the NBA will make them win the championship. To me thats just a form of cheating, since good players have huge egos like for example Kobe Bryant. Sure they can pull great shots when its crunch time but you cannot expect a team filled with superstars to win. And the Detroit Pistons proved that. They got great team work and they deserve to win the championship.  Now to another sport. Football, also know as soccer. If you follow football like me, then you would know the team Real Mardrid. Yes i know the team with about 6 superstars. Theres Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Raul, Roberto Carlos, and who could forget the metrosexual faggot David Beckham. There are more of course but those 6 are the main superstars in the team. Now if you dont know football then you would think that Real Madrid is the best team in Europe. Wrong. Not only do they suck, but this year they didnt even win any trophies. Pffff, its a joke. what ever happened to good old fashion football players playing for the love of the sport now its all bout the money. I think theres a song like that "its all a money..." well that enough writing for today
