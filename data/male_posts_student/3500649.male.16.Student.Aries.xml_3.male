I beg 4 god’s power- pls don’t turn me into a green-eyed monster. By the way, I have always been jealous about Sasi’s countless achievements (he is an excellent student).  this encourage me 2 work hard 2 outshine him (still, he is better than I am)  also , 2 attract his attraction to make him acknowledged of my existence (I don’t want 2 be a nobody in his eyes) . However, I did sth surprising, I ask teacher not 2 announce my achievement during the following school assembly 4 I felt my feat shouldn’t be earning 2 much compliments,  also I am afraid of go up the stage (although it is a glamorous moment)  thirdly, I think I should learn to “let go”- fame, arrogance, attention,  of course Sasi. I am tired of proving my ability 2 Sasi. I savour the love I have 4 him,  deep inside my heart I want him 2 know that, but, I knew that’s not going 2 happen… so I’ll just love him from the distance. 2 sum it all up, I sincerely hope that I can put my studies as the priority  ignore the loving matter. Keep me from distraction. I hope 1 day, I can find a girl that I like  lead a blissful life with her.
