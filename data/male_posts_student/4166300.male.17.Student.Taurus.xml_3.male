Am I so egotistical I think that people from all over the globe who probably don't know me waste valuable time reading a site about my life?  Tell you what, if you're still reading this right now, you need get new direction in your life or something.  Stop reading this, your life is ticking away and you'll be worm food soon.  Go outside.  Do some community service.  Make sweet love. Pick daisies.  Frolick in the meadows.  Carpe Diem or whatever-the-fuck.  Join the military.  God knows they'll give you enough trivial pursuits to occupy you besides read this.  Monty makes a blog?  That's got to be one of the harbringers of the Apocalypse.  I've always fancied myself as an Antichrist...  but really, is there anything I can say to satisfy your desire for tasty tidbits of information on my comings and goings?  Are you not entertained!?  Maybe its just me... being very... very... bored.  Rest in Peace Superfreak...  Rick James 1948-2004 "Cocaine is one Helluva Drug"
