I don't know why. So exams are coming up and I'm gonna feel the stress soon. At the moment I currently do not care. All I'm doing is waiting for Bubba Ho-tep to finish shipping from Amazon. Yes that's right the kick ass Bruce Campbell vs a mummy movie. In about two weeks my hair will be blue. I'm considering a mini mohawk in Chili Peppers Tribute of course the blue is for Flea. I'm gonna put some crazy pictures of it up when I'm done and have figured out how to do so.  I'm going to go jam up some bass music for now. Toodles -G
