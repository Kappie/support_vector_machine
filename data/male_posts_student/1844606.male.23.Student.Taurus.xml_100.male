And my 7 page one on Maus took only 2 hours.  I'm so glad I can write these things so quickly nowadays.  This obviously doesn't count re-writing time, but who cares.  This week is shaping up to be busy, not with a ton of effort, I just have to be lots of places at different times.  Lots of dr. appointments.  And meetings about my future and trying to find a job.  All of which will seriously cut into my nazi killing time.  I got Metal of Honor on Sat. and played it from 6:30 til 4am.  Haven't done that in a while.  Felt like a loser at the time.  Talked about it today with a girl and she thought it was pretty cool (for some reason) and patted my shoulder.  If only she didn't have a boyfriend.  She also mentioned that she likes to cook when she has the time.  Such excellent marriage credentials I tell you.
