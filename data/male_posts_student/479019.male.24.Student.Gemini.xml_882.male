I was amused with his repeating of "It's ignorant... it's ignorant." Chapelle show was good too. They showed the hardcore Wayne Brady skit again. "Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?" I also enjoyed Chapelle on jury selection. Haha... digital pee!  Ok so last night after enjoying some good entertainment on Comedy Central and a margarita, I decided to go rollerblading. I discovered that rollerblading, tequila, and lack of skills doesn't mix. I crashed into a dumpster, a fence, and a rock. I was so damn sore this morning.  If there's anything that  urlLink Bush  has a crappy record on, it's the environment. Not that Democrats don't kiss corporate polluter ass, but Bush as an oil man directly tied to some major polluters.  urlLink Arnold  on the other hand, I believe cares about the environment (somewhat), but not at the expense of his own fun.   ***
