I got to the top and heard the distinct sound of deer bounding through the brush down in the draw infront of me. This nice forked buck climbs up and stops on the ridge opposite me. Nice wide and tall fork covered with velvet, and he stops and looks back at me. I wish I had a camera as it would make a sweet desktop, but I didn't so I just watched until he went down the other side and out of sight. So I moved on up the hill and got to the tall brush and narrow pathways cut through it. I once again heard rustling in the bushes but it didn't sound like a deer and I didn't see one jump out of the brush. My dad had just seen a coyote the other day which was the first time in 8 years we've seen one, and so I had an uneasy feeling about plunging into the tunnel of brush unarmed exspecting to find who knows what inside. I decided to return home and made my way back down.  When I got back I chatted with Thomas and Kara while simultaneously playing Battlefield 1942: Invasion of the Phillippines (yeah multi-tasker extraordinaire right here). After realizing that I couldn't go on with my life with my defeat at Mount Rimrock on my shoulders so I grabbed my pellet gun and a box of pellets and went back up the mountain. I knew that if I ran into something my gun wouldn't help much, but after all, this was a psychologial war I'm fighting and fear just can't stand up to a guy wearing tactical footwear and toting a rifle. On my way up I shot a hummingbird. Yeah some might think it's cruel and that it's just a cute little harmless bird but it's a bird nonetheless, and has the fowl hunter's creed goes, "It flies, it dies" so I figure I was just doing my duty. I went all the way back up to the tunnels and went through with no resistance save the mighty thick spider webs I braved along the way. I followed the dirt road up for about half an hour or something and looked for a good place to setup a camp for airsoft. I caught a glimpse of the old shack which was probably another 45 minutes away so I turned around and came back.
