There is little that make me, the stoic emotionless rock that I am, giggle and laugh for joy these days. A good book can do it though. Here's the story: I've found this treasure trove of awesome old skool classics from all the greats. Aquinas, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, they're all here. I think they're called Great Books of the Western World or somesuch. Well, my friend recently told me that The Brothers Karamozov is a masterpiece and what do you know, but there it is. Right in Mona Freekin' Shores! But when I tried to take it out, it can up as a reference book and couldn't be taken out. I was downtrodden and complained to friends (really? friends?). But I tried it again, this time with a real librarian instead of a library assistant, and it worked! Yea verily, I shall bitch no more and even sing! I shall sing a song of joy to the Grand Librarian, and the God who used her to lead me to great literature. I'll be spending most of my senior year with one of these before my nose.  Doing a mock trial in AP Govt. We prepared quite well, figured out what the witnesses shall say and such. I think we'll win and Mike Mean shall be fried crispy. I choked up once, though. The witness said a wrong something, even something that contradicted her own evidence sheet. But I worry not, for we can prove what she was to say otherways.
