Tuesday:  My Packard Bell desktop was ready to pick-up at Mid Valley...So went and got the latest version of Microsoft Word as well which is err 2003 I think..so went home and put the computer back together but like all the original files were like all gone!But according to the guy who fixed my comp (Yusri),He said all my files were under the administrator username so had to and retrieve everything from there...but gotta reinstall most of my programs to I think like Word,Norton and what not...So I guess we`ll see how it goes...Im not quite sure how to do it so i`ll just leave all the stuff to dad..  Ok so finaly got a new Car! Toyota Vios!Damn chun man...the guy came and took the Wira away which was for trade in.A little sad seeing it goes cause like...when I came from the USA the car was like bigger thna my car which was a Geo Prism..Its like Wira shaped but like the auto version of a Wira 1.3 which was made by Chevrolet and Toyota pretty much so it was a good car..small enough for the 4 of us there so thats why got it..so it was like damn cool to come back and be in a much almost bigger car...it always seemed different to me when I 1st came in 1995 and for good in 1997..I guess it was cause I was young and was still in awe..heh..hmm its a 1.6 so got it off for rm16000...the guys like from Taiping and Assam Kumbang even!So could highly see the car there!All he has to do is just do some works on the car and he can easily sell it for 20000+ cause the cars still in good condition...So then went over to the Toyota Showroom in Bangsar..so picked up the car...damn those guys are like really into making good impressions and bla..the guy was like polishing the car still even on little little waterspots just before got the car!Its quite nice la...the cd players thankfully in the car but only 1 disc but its alright...And the boot needs to be slammed shut to close it..so gonna have to sent it for fixing as its still under warranty so why pay to have it done?But the nearest place is like section 19 so hmm have to do it on a weekend..  Ok then went to the Canon Office in Subang near the old Subang Airport to see abt the printer..and ugh...its costing like rm400 to fix!My god!They say the printer head is busted as well as the paper feeder or maybe the high price is intentional cause they dont wanna really repair things and are interested in selling new items which is less hassle and can save them time and money and get even more money..damn..So just traded it in for some Canon i560 Bubble Jet printer...the old printer trade in was worth like rm150 so paid like rm450 or so to get the printer...should be better cause its much newer than my old one which is like a S600 bubble jet printer which claims to be the fastest in its line but it was a lie I say!My god...when my dad prints stuff for stock market..it takes ages!  I was able to get all that stuff done cause Connie couldnt come over to do the sejarah project..looks like we`ll have to do it another day...Mom made spaghetti!yay!yum yum yum!  Ok so then later than evening,went by Nicola`s place and got the my cd from her and what not..talked a bit...Thats all..woah the walk all the way up Jalan Ara was like super tiring but its ok..I need to get my ass back in shape..then on the way home walking up Jalan Terasek I like met Chow Di who was jogging down the street like some madman cause he said he was going over to Nik`s house to get his brother...like whats up with that man...cant he walk back on his own or something?Weird...haha..  So I guess thats it for this entry and bla for Tuesday 1st June though its like 4days late!Will write the rest later for the following days!  Riz.
