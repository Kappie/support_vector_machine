After I get scolded, i tel myself "its was my wrong to play so don like tat, smile!" But i still can't get through the struggle... After a few mins, my mind became very confused and my heart was very empty. Who knos the more i struggle, the more confused in my mind... I felt like being a mad person, but i tel myself not to GIVE UP... If i give up, the Evil will win the battle. When these kind of things happen, i will need a quiet place or enviroment to hav a clear mind so tat i can fight the battle... Ppl who donno me well, might think tat i'm a mad person or wat. All these things has blocked me from serving God, doin things properly and its oso make me cannot concentrate on thinking things... I wish i could find a cure for tis kind of strange illness...
