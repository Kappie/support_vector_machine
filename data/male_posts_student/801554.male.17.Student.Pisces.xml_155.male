And it was enough to bring the race to an actual competitive level. I lost by about 100 or so votes. And completely won the Junior class. So I say to you Mr. Jensen: does it feel good when a huge percent of your consituents, your actual class, the people who know you best, didn't want you to win and you did anyway?  Ah well.
