I have talked with a number of people about the movie and have heard different responses to the content. My thoughts?... First of all, let me preface it all with the fact that i am not always the best person to ask about movies.Secondly,i think i will use this time todiscuss more about the subject of being"hardened",than write a review about a movie. Reviews are so relative to the viewers, so it seems best to reveal myself as a viewer, or listener, or reader.I think of myself being "hardened" to a lot of subjects. One of them is violence. I am not really sure why this is. I have not ever been at war, never shot anyone and have not been aprofessional wrestler or anything like that. However, I  have  been involved in violence a few times in my life. And i have been exposed to things that i believed have hardened me.   When i was a kid, i used to get in all kinds of fights. Some of them were rather brutal. I remember when i was in the fourth grade, i was riding my bike around witha friend. We were riding in a neighborhood that we usually didnt go into. That neighborhood had a posse of its own, like all neighborhoods do in suburbia. We rode up to them. There were about six kids hanging around a park that were all about our same age and they each had their own bikes. There was an older kid hanging with them who was probably in 6th or 7th grade, and at our age we all looked up to him.He was a guy that everyone knew, and we approached the posse because we knew him. I say that we knew him,but i learned that day that he wasn't really our friend.He wanted us (me in particular...i have yet to understand why)to fight. We looked up to him, like i said, and the peer pressure of him was a big factor. But it wasn't really peer pressure, it was more of the longing to be known, by him, by someone older that we respected. I did not have any reason to fight though. I can't just start fighting with someone by telling myself to fight. I have a temper, and my fighting mode is triggered by my temper. So i told them, that i dont have any reason to fight. (My temper was not engaged.) So then, some kid about my size, although slightly more lean, came over and pushed me off my bike. It wasn't a gentle, playful push, it was a dramatic, full-thrust push of violence. I fell off my bike hard. My temper was clicked on. And so i fought.I essentially rushed him and tackled him to the ground where we wrestled around, throwing the occasional punch. I finally got him in a head lock where i held him until he pretty much started crying and begged me to let go. I did. One down. Then another kid walked over and we started fighting. It was a lot of kicks and punches and blocking punches and dodging and grunting. (Although kids of that age don't really grunt.) At one point we were in a lock and i was hurting. He knew some tactical skills. I remember asking while locked: "You know karate" He responded: "Yea" And then we broke away and continued. He eventually landed an alwful hard punch/slap on my ear. For those of you that know me, know that i have sensitive ears. I had tubes in my ears when i was a kid and countless ear infections. I even had my eardrum blown out once. When he hit me, that was the second time. I fell to the ground and started crying. The pain was unbelievable. I crawled back to my bike and rode home, bawling in humility all the way. When i got home i ran to my mom and cried in her arms. She was always the one i went crying to when i lost a fight.   Another time, when i was in 8th grade, i went to a summer camp for boy scouts. At the time i was the Senior Patrol leader. For those of you that were never in Boy Scouts, the Senior Patrol leader is the leader of the whole troop. They are elected democratically, with nominations and a final vote. I was elected unanimously and was rather respected. Four of us went to this camp in Wente, California a week early to get some leadership training and such. We were sharing a camp from a group of inner city Boy Scouts from LA. They were all black kids, that probably  did  shoot people and such. It was a "privilege" to be out there for them. The four of us from our troop were living in two canvas-platform tents in their camp. Their leader was a guy who had joined the peace corps or something and was somewhat watching us for that week too. But he pretty much let us do what we wanted, we were pretty responsible. One morning, my tentmate, Billy Bracco, woke me up and said that they (the inner city kids) were throwing rocks at us. Right as he said that, a few rocks flew in....a big one. I am generally pretty passive...Like i said...Without my temper, i am a lamb. I went out back of the tent and was taking the morning leak, when a jagged rock about the size of a plumb hit me right on the side of the face where ones temple is located. It's sting turned me into full rage. My temper guided it. I ran after the kid with super human speed in nothing but my boxers. I chased him for a few hundred yards into a tent. I tackled him in there and started beating him up pretty bad. He was curled up on the wooden floor of the tent while i punched him a few times, then i got up and started kicking him many times. He started crying and i let up. I told him i was sorry and walked back to my tent wondering how i just did a thing like that. My face was covered in blood and it ran down my cheeks and chin. I had a scar from that rock the size of a plumb for about a year.   There are other stories like that, i could tell, but i think you get the point. I haven't had my temper be triggered for a long time. I am thankful too. I remember in high school, i was always afraid something would trigger it and i would get into a big fight. In high school, fights mean a lot more things. For one, they draw crowds of hundreds. Two, people can get really hurt. Three, people take revenge. Four, the repercussions for your actions in high school are serious. I started to play football to vent my rage. I think it worked, because i never really got into a fight. But i say with a smile that i was the lightest linemen in our school at about 150 lbs. Starting every game as guard or tackle.   On top of the fights, i read a lot. Anyone who reads a lot will become hardened i believe. You get to this point where you just read the words and imagine the scenes and they become normal. I have read some really disturbing books, including a lot of books about war. There is the classic, Red Badge of Courage, there is Catch-22 (which is really more funny than anything), there is Brave New World, Slaughterhouse Five, Heart of darkness, Shakespeare's plays, Of Mice and Men, This Boy's Life, Where the Caged Bird Sings, The Hatchet, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, Once and Future King, Arctic Explorations, The Pearl, The Grapes of Wrath, Dog Song, Lord of the Flies, Mambas and Man-Eaters(an autobiography byC.J.P Ionides), In Pharaoh's Army (by Tobias Wolff about Vietnam), Roots, The Long Walk, Into the Wild, not to mention short stories by Carver. All these books have hardened me in some way, often to violence and abuse. I think this plays a big factor to being hardened to subject.   Then, there are movies. I have seen an awful lot of movies. Movies definitely harden people up to the visual images of subjects, whether it be violence, sadness, adultery, warfare, and countless other things. If you know someone who is a huge movie person, ask them about hardening.   I have to mention one other thing. That is my history of fishing and hunting. As long as i have been old enough to remember, i have gone fishing with my Grandpa. You are there to kill. You are there to catch with violence and kill. And its fun. Maybe some people think its not fun and they would cry with sorrow. But i think its fun, its been fun as long as i can remember. You catch the fish and reel it in, and you have to rip the hook out of its mouth. Maybe it helps people to know that fish cant feel pain. But for me, it seems natural. I have always eaten all the fish i ever kept, and there is something human in catching fish and killing them. Then cleaning them. Its a bloody violent act. You chop off their heads with large knives and hammers. There is crunching and slipping as you try to succeed. Then you rip open their belly and pull out all their insides with your fingers. The only time i have every felt sympathy is when the stomach is full of eggs. I also had good friends growing up that were hunters. I never killed any fowl or mammals, but i went with them a lot, just to hang out. I tend to believe that anyone who hunts and fishes is very hardened to violence.   And you know, today i was reading the Bible, reading 1 Samuel. Samuel was a prophet of God. He was essentially a priest, a traveling hermit who was very Godly. There is a scene in 1 Samuel, where Samuel gets word from God to tell Saul " 'I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself againstMe on the way while he was coming up from Egypt. Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' " Saul does not kill them all though. So Samuel comes and rebukes Saul, then " Samuel said, 'Bring me Agag, the kind of the Amalekites.' And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, 'Surely the bitterness of death is past.' But Samuel said, 'As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.' And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal."  Interesting.   And an essay later, i go back to the movie. As far as the movie goes. I liked it. Was it violent, yes. Did i have disgusted looks on my face when i saw some of the violence, yes. Did i close my eyes a few times so not to harden me further, yes. Would i tell my mom to see it, probably not. Did i cry when a little boy who doesn't even know the word for gun, has to decide whether he wants his hand shot or foot shot, yes. And yet, maybe thats what i like about the movie. It makes me cry. It moves my emotion. I could watch it a hundred times, and could get more and more hardened to certain scenes, but there will always be scenes that no matter how hardened i become, i will want to cry. I will want to go there and triggered by my temper, want to beat the crap out of the villain. It makes me empathetic, and cherish life all the more. It makes me appreciate what I have and makes me want to do so much more for those that dont have it. It makes me not want to waste my life sitting at the desk working on Numerical Analysis. All those books i listed do the same. They  give  me emotion. They give me wisdom, and my hope is, i can love all the more, as the end approaches.   Peace
