Last night I went to Jenny's fancy dress party, it was cool, everyone there (except one or two people, who got beats) was in fancy dress - I went as Julius Caesar, but was mistaken for Jesus/some sort of Greek God twice, and Sam was also Julius Caesar/Jesus/Greek God. Ollie was a pirate, Jamie was wearing a wetsuit, Ging was a women, Rob was a black man, and there were more pirates, cowboys, people in suits, slipknotetc.. Much fun.        This last school week has been long and easy, monday I didn't do much, 'cos we had a French cover, and watched videos in other lessons. Tuesday was a school trip to the Imperial War Museum, which meant we got back late, and Wednesday was sports day; I had to run the 200 m  and the 4x300 m  relay. I came 5th in the 200 m  out of6 people, but Radcliff dropped out, so only 5 people ran..but I got the same amount of points as if 6 people ran and I was 5th, so that was nice. When I got home I worked on my English coursework for  hours,  but it was worth it.        Then thursday was also long and boring, and I worked for ages on my maths coursework that day aswell, very tiring. Friday - all the coursework got handed in, and I managed to get out of Double History by playing in the house Cricket. I didn't really play, I just sat on the side lines, and somehow we won the match with only 2 batters, and Mr. Mochan said he'd give us all 7 house ties if we won, so I'll be expecting them soon. Heh.        Oh, and the Flat Earth Society album I ordered arrived yesterday, and its tres good. I'm off to my clarinet lesson soonish, then I'm leaving not long after, so don't expect a post for ages unless I find a computer there.        Ta ra.
