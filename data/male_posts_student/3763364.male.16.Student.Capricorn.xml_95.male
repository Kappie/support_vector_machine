He really misses the feeling of euphoria that it brings, and he's going through bad withdrawl. In fact, his body could even go into shock and he could die.  In his discombobulated mind, he is thinking "Man, I NEED HEROIN. NEED. NEED. NEED. That is the only only thing that will make me feel better!"  Is heroin the only thing that is going to make him feel better?  Wouldn't a life of recovery and happiness be great?  Doesn't this scenario apply to many things?
