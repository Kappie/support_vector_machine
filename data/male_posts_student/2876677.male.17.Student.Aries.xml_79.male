I gave up caring so long ago.  Unfortunately, it has turned into widespread apathy...  Everyone is so messed up.  I did have one minor epiphany today.  I used to be that way.  Oh  Whose Line?  was a  little innapropriate last night...  DERR!!!  It always is.  Sometimes(rarely) just a little, most of the time it is just filled with perverseness.  Why even put it on that channel?  Hello???  It is going to be bad.  Think about it.  Wow I was a retard.  Unfortunately a majority of people still are...
