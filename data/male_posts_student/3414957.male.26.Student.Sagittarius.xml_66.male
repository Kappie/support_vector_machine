I would love to live alone and invent things and write about things. That can't be all there is to my life is it? I think so. If I strive for other things, friends, relationships, anything, I just fall flat. Arrrghhhh. I guess patience is what is needed but the longer you wait and have no idea what will come, the more impatient you get with life. It's a vicious circle.
