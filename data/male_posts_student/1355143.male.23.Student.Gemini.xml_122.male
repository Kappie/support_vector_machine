It's kind of funny how the ever so smart Chinese consider Ulli's blogspot a threat to national security and choose to ban it.   On my way back home I went up to the Mongolian grasslands for a 5-day horseback riding trip with the locals. Great experience that I strongly recommend, but they weren't obviously that used to dealing with tourists. After three entire days in a wooden saddle (no comfortable leather here) my ass was so sore I could hardly walk, but stuck in the middle of nowhere there weren't to many options. Two more days served the only purpose of changing my arse's colour from blue to purple. But the view was great, and the people despite their lack of understanding for my misery were the nicest.    So, back in Norway I'm indeed working my balls of Adam. Maybe not cracking numbers until late, but taking care of those "mentally dysfunctional children" or whatever you call it, is serious business. But I love it. Seeing those children smiling and laughing despite their every day struggles makes you realize how great this gift of life really is. Making a difference for other people is, all in all, the essence of our being.  BTW, a small quiz for our true bloggers: The Mongolians drink a lot of tea. When they drink it, they mix it with goatmilk and ..... (what other thing?)   Vegard
