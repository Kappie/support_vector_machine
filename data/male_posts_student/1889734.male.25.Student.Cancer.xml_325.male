Not really 'new' news, but it is a nice confirmation.  The presence of water is the greatest thing that can happen in terms of future exploration.  Oxygen and rocket fuel can easily be extracted from the Martian soil, which cuts the cost enormously.  It's looking more and more likely that Mars could have supported life.
