The sad thing is, that unless I concentrate, all meaning has been sucked out of the date, it's just a random collection of alphanumeric symbols at this point.  When I concentrate though....quite depressing.  Well, right now it's 6:40 in the morning and i have to get to school in 5 minutes, I'll leave this page on, though, so i don't forget about this thing's existence again, thank you Slashdot and Google for reminding me.  See everyone, (or is it no one?) later.
