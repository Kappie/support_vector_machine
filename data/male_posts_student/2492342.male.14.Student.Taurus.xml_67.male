'tell ur mom the grocery store is selling pills thatll make her forget about joe or steve or that guy. she'll run. and this is just casual. matt won't care.' 'alright!'  massive terrorist bombings in spain. its really sad. somehting like 200 people dead, 1000 injured. not sure if its ETA or al qaeda. hm..  which means mr rosenbaum has like...hes not sure whether we're not going to spain. sissies. everyone here is a coward. they yell at everyone who does things and calls them cowards, like the people who blow themselves up, but i dont get it. wouldnt you all die for your country? how is that cowardly? i dont know...  after school i taked to luis for first time. he seems nice. aida too. but i ahd to stay til 3 40 and ms allen cut off the power at 3 15. nice.  luis knows melanie's person, leticia. he scared me with his description at first, 'ugly..short..smelly" but then he said he was kidding. so alright then. he never answered. i decided to go to a university and get him a sweatshirt. chocolate or something for his family. aida said to get him 'large'. hm.   we talked about everything. tomorrow we'll do the same. they learn us history in 1o secundaria..our 10th grade....i think its...i dont know. i just dont like it. i cant explain why not. im weird.  so yeah, last ngiht it alked to brighton and she said she didnt know why sex was such a big deal..the first time is special, but its not big after that. AHH. who knew. she seems so innocent. sort of. i just didnt think that. hm...i asked her who and she said it was personal. i dont think its DJ. lol  sat with samantha at lunch. it was nice. sarah and her lackie and lindsey had all eaten, so they studied. im sort of mad at sarah. she's controlling. thats why she likes jenna. she doesnt talk or say what she thinks. me and samantha talked about her. and about sable. and everything. and yet nothing at the same time. it was so hot.   i downloaded a good song by molotov. 'gimme the power'. aida recommended it.   oh..i was gonna write it up there..but i was too lazy.. after the part about brighton. from an lfo song. my favorite song on the CD.   'my little peace of heaven has a secret she won't tell.'   lol..it sounds silly in retrospect. the song is about this guy who makes this chcik whos crying happy...and then she goes back to the guy that made her cry. i can relate to that. sadly...lol..sort of. and in relation to people you dont know.....*looks away*  Going under.....by evanescence.....AHHHHHH FUCKING AWESOME. i love evanescence. i should really get that CD. i need it.its my blood.    i promised jennifer she could cut me tomorrow. we ditched spanish quickly to do it, but i didnt wanna get AIDS from her bloody knife so shes bringing a safety pin tomorrow. dont worrry, im not psycho. id rather she cut me than herself. and so it goes. whatever it takes i guess. dont try to figure out what that means....well. try. u wont succeed. it has nothing to do with cutting or helping jennifer. it has to do with how pathetic i am. lol  i dont want to stop writing... i want to wake up and be alone..yet..with someone. aisha. that sounds good. wake up with aisha. and its raining..a steady stream..the clouds are making it dark..and i hug aisha. forever.   The memories are fading  My posters are falling down  I try to hold on  But I just wanna let go  Am I just being selfish,  For wanting it to end?  Am I just screaming for attention?  Nobody will ever know  Because nobody will ever ask  They can't hear my screams of pain  Or the lonely whisper of my soul  They choose to ignore the signs  And so I'll slice my wrists  Nobody will ever know  Because nobody will ever see  Because there is nobody out there  That truly sees me  thats not by me..but i like it..because it is me. well..aisha sees me i guess.   khoda. i hate writing 'lol'. im starting to write it after everythign serious to sort of make my emotions seem lighter. its getting annoying. and i cant stop myself. i cant stop anything. im worthless. and weak.  uh oh.
