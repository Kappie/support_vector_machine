It's what you portray. Your personality, the example you set, and that's huge for me."  "The greatest glory never comes from falling, but from rising each time you fall."    "It's important that I make a difference in some way. It's not necessarily how I make a difference, but I want to make sure that I do."   "...as long as you're living right, then you don't have  to worry about what people see."  "Half my butt is mac  cheese and the other half is Krispy Kreme..."  Hehehehehehe, I bet you'll NEVER guess who said all that.....
