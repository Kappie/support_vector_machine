I was about to wake up, got a phone call from a friend that My other friend (DJ) is going to a singing contest and the event is just accross the road from my house. I jumped to the shower and get dressed.   I took 2 rolls of films of ther people and my friends as well. From watching we have talented singers and bands and I was feeling good because some of them are aged about 12 and got to final 18s. In later afternoon would advance to final 5s and so on. I decided to come back home and clear some work first.   I will post the pictures next time :)   WISHING U GOOD LUCK "DJ" ALL THE BEST MY FRIEND...
