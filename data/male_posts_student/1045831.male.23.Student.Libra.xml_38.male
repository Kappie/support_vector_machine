So I wrote my teacher got an extension and now I have almost finished a better version but it still need a lot of editing.  This paper is fairly odd and giving me a lot of trouble but I swear to Jebus that it will be awesome by tommorrow.  But I'm off to make a bunch of money to pay for my stupidity tonight so all you kids out there have fun while I'm slaving for the man..  and in the memorable words of Nik Loecher, "I'm out like Kyle Wilson in a dodgeball game."
