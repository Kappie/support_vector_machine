It came with an aimbot, wallhacks (multiple ones), and a thing that negates the effects of smoke and flash grenades.  Sounds pretty cool, no?  Well, the last features were, the wallhacks were sort of lame.. and the aimbot sucked.  What it did was lock onto the target, and just 'hold' down the trigger, even if i was out of bullets.  And it wouldn't reload either.    That didn't help me much.  I also tried out the wallhacks, they didn't do much, i couldn't see through where i wanted to.    In the end, i was better without the hacks.  I've decided to come clean, i deleted the hacks.  The lesson learned today, is that it's not good to cheat!  Lates
