I feel that uncontrolable urge to jump, sing, dance even (if you can call what I do dancing). Good music can do that to me and that's what happened last night: good music.  Rock The Coast ! I really liked AudioA's performance, no matter what they say. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I left early with my family to beat the rush. I missed the Cow Bell *sigh*.   Saw Shrek 2 today. I want to hang our critic for the Chronicle. That bloody cynic, that disgraceful insult to unbiased workmanship! It was funny as can be and moreso. It's been a while since I've watched a comedy. This was one worth watching.  I love it when people mistake me for a Senior. It gives me a sense of superiority, that in some way, I appear older and more developed. Like a fine wine or piece of cheese. At least three people has asked me why I was still here, now that the Seniors have long gone. It feels good.
