X-Tra Special Dedications to  urlLink Killa Kel  for the recommendations on the Portishead songs....I now know what people were raving about before....it's good stuff....  My subscription to Entertainment Weekly and Maxim have caused me to wonder why we (blacks) don't have those types of publications....no offense to Ebony, Jet, Black Enterprise or their readers....but it seems to me that to write for these publications you must sign a waiver turning over anything resembling a sense of humor....I mean really....is there a non-patronizing Black magazine with some sense of an edge....why doesn't Chris Rock or someone like that take on that task?....We did it twice a month at the Maroon Tiger so I know it can be done....we brought the news and current issues while at the same time maintaining a tongue in cheek sarcasm that seems to be reserved only for college students.....oh well maybe my buddy  urlLink Beth  will do that for me....  My dad is doing so much better and I feel so great about it....he left me a message on my voice-mail in typical C. Miles fashion with a movie reference (New Jack City....he called me Nino Brown)....thanks once again to all those who have shown concern, compassion, whatever....it means alot to me for real!  I can't wait to go back to Atlanta for Morehouse's graduation (and the other AUC graduations for that matter)....Hopefully I will be able to handle all of my excess business in Atlanta (pick up the car, tie up some loose ends with some friends, eat at Lafonda)....  Songs of the moment (no particular order)....  1) Musiq - Half Crazy....This dude can do no wrong so far....yet another in a series of Musiq songs I am feeling....I can't wait to go to the hook up spot on Friday and pick this up....  2)Portishead - Roads....This is the first song that Kelly told me about and also the best of the ones I've heard....why did it take me so long to wake up and listen to this???  3)Cameo - She's Strange....Partly because this song applies to so many women in my life right now....and partly cuz the cameo never gets old  4)Janet Jackson - Would You Mind....Janet has a way with words.....and she has her way with the words on this one....  5)Ceelo - Bad Mutha...."I'm bad, I'm bad, I know I'm bad".....it reminds me of growing up in Southwest Atlanta....where stuck up kids "thought they were bad"....  Also worth noting:  That video by this chick Truth Hurts is one of the scariest things in creation....I don't like the cut of her jib....  The Fresh Prince of Bel Air was an aight lil show in hindsight....  A Different World on TBS is in the stretch run right now....the zenith....the apex....the creme de le creme....this morning's shows were the episode where Ron and Dwayne have a run in with racist football fans (also known as the episode with Mr. Carosi from the Beach episodes of Saved by the Bell) and the episode with the fake ex-con who gets treated badly while using questionable journalistic techniques (also known as the episode where Dwayne Wayne makes his only faux pas of the entire run of the series and tells him to "go to Morehouse with that")  That's enought for now....I'll be back when I get the feeling....
