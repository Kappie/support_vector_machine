I hear you can post photos/images on it directly, which would pretty much be the reason for me creating this blog.  It'll probably just be for things like art. Sort of a cross between Live Journal and DeviantArt. Hopefully, however, I can post more publicly on here, as it's likely that no-one's going to know it exists for at least a while.   (Live Journal -   urlLink  www.livejournal.com/users/minimullet   )   (DeviantArt -  urlLink http://minimullet.deviantart.com )     So why  Ujimaflip ? - Well, it was pretty much the first thing that came into my head. I figured that  Spaceboy  would be taken,  minimullet 's a bit misleading, as I don't have a mullet (be it small or not), nor am I small generally. Something derived from my name would just be a bit... unoriginal.  Now that's all sorted, it's time to peruse my journal, and make it feel more like home.   Currently listening to:   Love Will Find a Way  by Yes
