Cory and I walked down to Quizno's and Coldstones and on our way down there we discussed how we would implement the alternate ego's of our characters.  Ultimately, we concluded that the alternate egos will be our subconcious's acting out into our daily activities - so whenever comic relieve is needed...It's alternate ego time 8-)    To be honest, I keep having troubles remembering all the funny stuff that happens to us daily so, lol, I need you guys to keep us up with ideas.    ;) I'm out for now
