Or Mt. Rushmore.  I dont think that he made big enough contributions.  Except to the national debt.  Oh well.  Nothing is new except I am now done with COD and now the real stress is on.  For a job and for a program.  Starting Monday its time to rock.  Should be a good weekend though.  Work until midnight tomorrow.  Saturday has the wolf exhibit preview and the zoo picnic.  Excited for that.  Grandma is here and that brings alot more responsibility.  I mean, yeah, Im a CNA, but its different when its someone you care about.  Not saying that I dont care about my patients, but Im a lot more cautious and careful with her than just anyone.  I feel like this place is more of a hotel than a house.  I think I need to get away too.  Its starting to wear on me a bit.  Feeling uncomfortable again, not with others, but with myself.  Crawling feeling.  Wanna jump out of my skin.  I HATE THIS!!!  Drives me nuts.  Oh well.  Best go to bed even though its early because it will be a long weekend.  Hopefully a good one, but I know it will be long...
