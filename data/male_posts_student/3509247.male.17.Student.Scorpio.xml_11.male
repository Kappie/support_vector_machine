I think honesty may have something to do with it.  Honesty about self, honesty about feelings, honesty about othersâ€” I think they all hurt when the people don't like the truth behind the words.  I read Stephanie's blog today about commitment.  I know I'm committed to my friends, but am I really helping them by letting them believe lies?  What's worse is that when I tell them the truth, it hurts them and me.  I wish I didn't have to have these tough possitions.  In my devotions today I chose to start reading in Glatians.  No apparent reason, just though I should read there.  I also decided to read a Proverb a day seing as how it's June 1st.  In Galatians the basic theme of the first chapter stuck out with me.  I can sum it up in two verses: verse 1 and verse 24. (I'm quoting from the King James)  "Paul an apostle, not of men, neither by man;, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead."  "And they glorified God in me."  Wow, Paul works for God and people glorified God in him?  What a concept.  I'm sure he was probably presented with some personal praise, but he put it towards God's glory.  The verse in Proverbs that stuck with me was verse 8: "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not."  So simple a command, but how hard is it to follow?  I find myself falling into peer pressure all the time.  Somehow I have to pray that God will strengthen me so that when those temptations come along, I can be strong and resist those carnal desires.  Just some thoughts for some of you.  Once again, I am in debt to JDR for his incredible skills of a webdesigner.  Thanks for the cool comment thingy and thanks in advance for the address book thing (however that works).
