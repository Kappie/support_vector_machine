ANDOLAN HOKE RAHEGA !!!!! JAI KHEBUS !! JAI VENKIES !!! BHALE ISKE LIYE MUJHE JAAN SABUN SE HAATH HI NA DHONA PADEY ....ANDOLAN HOKE RAHEGA !!! anyway ...yahn bahut bura haal hai ...Our orientation started on the 1st jisme case methodology etc padhaana shuru kar diye ..plus there were compulsory sessions by professors of fin,mark, etc etc ...and then the various committees here made their presentation .. it all started at 9:00 AM and went on till 2:00 AM (thats after midnight).And at the end of the day we had 3 assignments ...including an all important case submit which would be crucial for our summer placements .The agenda for the next 2 days were the same ..and I hardly get to sleep more than 3-4 hrs here per day ... I finally submitted my case yesyterday ..typed around 10 pages of a MS wrod document all on my own ... today I have to giv a group presentation at 9:30 PM and I still havent met my group members !!! Plus the info that arnd 30 odd guys are chucked out of this institute every year ...the acads rules are very stringent ..u get 2 F's or 1 F and 2 D's ..u're thrown out .. I guess I'l be joining infy soon... cheers, swami   Swami's characteristics in Kgp can be summed up with one word.. GARFIELD. So all you people thinking about belling the CAT, think again. And those who are "BEEN THERE, DONE THAT" kinds, guide us.   urlLink --My Blog--
