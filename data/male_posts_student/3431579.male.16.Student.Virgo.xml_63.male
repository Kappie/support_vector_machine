"less talk, more rock!" was the battle cry of the night, bitch. yeah, little cats awesome as shit and velvet teen is so damn good live. im a little ho - i bought all their cds. whatever. bitch. the crowd was fucking huge and it was hot and people were everywhere and there was no room anywhere and it sucked for those reasons only. at one point, these two bitche-ass gilrs just cut their way through the crowd and decided to stand directly in front of me and dillon. fuck that! haha, i did the hard gun thing (hand in the shape of a gun) and put it to her head. it accidentally touched her head and she turned around and i was just like "yo what up," all while julan and dillon were laughing really fucking hard. heh, awesome. little cat owns electronic shit. his stuff really reminds me of the stuff i used to make on fruity loops, just A LOT A LOT A LOT better. the velvet teen was rad, it was cool, they dedicated that show to logan whitehurst (their ex-drummer. ex because of brain cancer) and that just kicked ass. he was actually there, but he had an eye-patch and a cane. shit. i think i managed to piss julian off, and for that im sorry, but whatever, but like i said, theres nothing i (or anyone else for that matter) can do about it now. but all in all, a good show - the americas were pretty cool, the 2 other bands werent that bad, and velvet teen and little cat owned the fuckin house. bitches.......  and now for the really pressing issue:  julia . fuckin shit!!!!!!! this is so shitty!!!!!! i hate this so much!!!!!!!! fuckin shit.... hmmmmm, i think im just gonna tell her the next time i chill with her (not going to tell her online again, thats lame). yeah. im gonna do that. this is just rediculous, i cant stand it anymore. ill tell her and i hope that will help me in some way. no idea how, but i hope it will. hmmmm..... lame lame lame lame lame. i hope its just my mind fuckin with me, but she seems to be acting the same way she was when we were "actively pursuing" eachother. i know im acting the same, and it sucks because i cant stop it. FUCK!!!!!! yeah, im telling her the next time i see her. dont know what shell say, and frankly that doesnt matter right now, i just need to get this out, maybe (hopefully) itll help me. this is just so much to handle (personally, mentally) and it sucks. ill tell her, wait for a reaction and just say "aiight cool. glad i got that out."  music of  this  moment: your cell - the velvet teen. yeah, its taken me about 20 mins to write this and ive just been listening to + - = the whole time.  hmmm, this ones a little long i think.   rad.
