We stayed at a Bed and Breakfast at the top of the town, unfortunately, there was no room in the place where we usually stayed hence the fact that I slept on the sofa, but I didn't mind, as it was absolutely huge!!  In the morning of Friday, my dad bought me some 'bomb's' from a small shop which sells a lot of stuff, they're not actually bombs, its just a bag with a small bag of vinegar inside it an then powder in the larger bag, and when the vinegar reacts with the baking soda, the gases cause the bag to explode very very loudly. So I sneakily placed a lot of them around town, while me and my dad were amused as people leapt in the air, it was very amusing!!!  On the second day of being there, my Dad bought me a Karma deck, it is very nice 7.5" Round Logo deck. I haven't skated it properly yet, but that is soon to change, the deck is like a feather its loverly to skate, but the best of all, its strong! Unfortunately after this, the forecast was a Tropical Storm, it was quite bad, but not as bed as they said, it was just very strong winds and a lot of rain. Later that day, we left and went on a 5 hour journey home, it should've in theory been 3 hours, but NO, the guy in the sky had to shit on us again, aww well, he still rocks!!!
