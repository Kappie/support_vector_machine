Somehow, I managed to snooze it until it was 9:48am: class starts at 10:05, and I just said, "fuck it," and went back to sleep until now.  I stayed up until 3 last night.  Do you know what I was doing?  I was playing this video game that Carissa bought called Black  White: Creature Isle.  It's an entertaining game -- you get to be God.  Today I'm going to the optometrist, tutoring Noelle in physics, finding a speaker for the 5:30, and running with Carissa.  Tonight -- who knows.  Shit.  I really do feel out of sorts.  I shouldn't skip class, it's just not worth it.  If I were in class, I'd be feeling bored but fine, and I'd only have 27 minutes left.  As it is, I feel very jittery.  But why?  I can do the work: I don't need to be there to understand.  The professor doesn't care if I show up or not.  Yesterday, I went with my girlfriend to see her therapist.  I don't usually endorse couples' therapy: it smacks of overpriced anger management courses for two.  But this wasn't like that -- I was going to support her in an adventure she was involved with.  Her therapist is a totally cool guy -- except that he's (a) pretty good looking, and (b) really smart.  But he's married.  Supposedly.  He works out of his house.  I didn't see his wife.  He kept talking about gay.  Gay is a fun subject to talk about, though.  Will  Grace, for example.  They get a whole TV show.  The jokes go like this:   Grace : Will, you're so gay.  Will : I know!  I just have gay rubbed all over me!  Grace : Will, that's disgusting.  Will : Mmmm hmmm... baby, you know you want this.  But you can't have it, because I'm gay!  Grace : [laughs]  That's exactly how it happens.  Every time.  Recently, I told you that someone called me metrosexual.  Well, it now appears that it is "in" to be metro: I don't know when that happened.  I mean, Bush is president and he's a borderline neo-con born again Christian, so the cool vibes definitely aren't emanating from  his  office.  But I guess we already knew that.  No, the cool vibes seem to flow down from some place north and east of Miami: England.  On November 15th, 1994, Mark Simpson, a journalist for the British media outlet  The Independent  wrote:  Some people said unkind things. American GQ, for example, was popularly dubbed ''Gay Quarterly''. Little wonder that all these magazines Â with the possible exception of The Face Â address their  metrosexual  readership as if none of them were homosexual or even bisexual.  [ urlLink The Word Spy ] It took several years for the word to really take off: it wasn't until Mark Simpson used the word again in a Salon.com article in 2002 that it gained the public recognition it deserved.  "Since then it has been picked up by thousands of media outlets, has made numerous TV appearances, has spawned at least a couple of books, and has been dropped in untold numbers of cocktail party conversations," writes The Word Spy.  Beautiful.
