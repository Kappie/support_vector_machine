Although I barely made it, at #20, I am still glad for myself.  However, the fact that I came in barely at number twenty has made me learn a lesson; and that's to give something your all from the start.  Although my highschool goal to make this list wasn't until 10th grade, my 9th grades could have been like the rest of my high school carreer's grades; better.  But still, I'm not complaining.  Congrats goes out to Solid Smut, who achieved the #6 GPA of our class.  And congrats to Jena, making the #2 spot.  I forgot what else I was going to say, oh well.. Goodbye.
