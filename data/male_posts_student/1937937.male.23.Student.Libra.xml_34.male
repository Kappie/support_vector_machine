If you have use of at least one eye, you probably know about the recent prison abuse scandal that has rocked the current administration -- in particular, Donald Rumsfeld.  An article that came out on  urlLink The New Yorker 's website yesterday points the finger directly at Rumsfeld's Under-Secretary for Intelligence, Stephen Cambone.  The piece was written by Seymour Hersh, and can be found by following  urlLink this link .  The story is actually a follow-up on Hersh's article last week, entitled " urlLink Torture at Abu Ghraib: American soldiers brutalized Iraqis.  How far up does the responsibility go? "  Now, I know Seymour isn't entirely to be trusted -- for a good conservative spin response, check out FrontPage Magazine's " urlLink See More Hersh ", by Lowell Ponte.  But overall, if even some of Hersh's information is correct, it certainly presents a fascinating story.  Rumsfeld  needed  to get rapid responses out there on the battlefield in Afghanistan -- I think most people will understand that.  These ops worked so well in the covert atmosphere of Afghanistan, the DD seems to have thought they could bring it into the more open battlefield in Iraq: this almost reads as an honest mistake.  What really scares me is that it's pretty clear these guys don't know what they're doing.  Obviously, that's always the case: we're all humans, none omniscient -- a few of us are just lucky sometimes -- but I like to at least be able to fantasize that they're somehow "in control" up there in the White House.  Even if I don't agree with what Bush does, it's been a comfort that he's so damn sure of himself.  But this time, well... as some Yahoo board's poster put it: "To the Arabic world, Bush has now proved Osama right."
