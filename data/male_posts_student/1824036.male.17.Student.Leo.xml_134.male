I hope we rock the joint. I know of a lot of people that want me to fail terribly...but there are even more that want me to do great. I dunno some people are just bitter. But thats their problem. When I bust out my solo on our song, yeah you aren't going to want to even talk to me. Ill be too cool for you!!!  *LOL*  Not quite, but whatever. Our band kicks butt. I hope that somebody that matters hears us kick some major butt!!! Then we can get another gig to practice for :)  Also, thanks to Kyle S. and Brian G. for helping us in the sound area! :)
