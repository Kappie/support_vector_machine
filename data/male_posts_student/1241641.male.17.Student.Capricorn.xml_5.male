Although I would gladly accept the vice presidential bid from Democratic Senator John Kerry, I am forced to decline such an invitation.  Laws previously established by our government legally and constitutionally prohibit me from being sworn in as vice president of The United States of America.  Perhaps in 2024, but not 2004.  And as long as we are setting rumors straight, I do NOT have a tattoo of the Iranian flag on my left buttock.  It is of the French flag.  USA!  USA!  USA!  And now, to honor Ronald Reagan, a riddle:  Quick!  Name the five U.S. Presidents not buried in the United States!   urlLink Answer   Let's cure Alzheimer's.  More stem cell research!
