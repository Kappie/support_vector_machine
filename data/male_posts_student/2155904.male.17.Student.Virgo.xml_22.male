That was really good because Tyke popped in some old movies of him while they waited.  Movies such as the infamous 10th Grade Biology video which is sure to be lodged in the memories of all who have seen it in full.  It is something else.  Simply amazing.  Wow, Tyke was so cool when he was younger.  Now he is just awesome.  Tyke likes to toot his own horn.  Mainly cuz he doesn't get it tooted by anybody else (sorry for the attempt at a double meaning there for it was not meant to be a serious statement...just a jocose statement).  Then when Macaroon got there Tyke and the gang surprised the hell out of him.  It was so great.  Unbelievably great.  He had no idea.  He thought the surprise was for Amed.  Nope, wrong Mr. McGee.  So they played DDR basically for 4 hours.  A little HAGSITDWSO in there and some Dance Twister (yeah, that is still at Tyke's house...hmmm I wonder why?!!!!!).  The three lovely ladies Haras Relda, Purdy McHot, and Mandy Moneymaker all made their exits prematurely unfortunately.  But this is how it goes when you have boyfriends or when you get sick.  Tyke didn't really know if they left because they didn't feel good or what.  Really though it doesn't matter.  Onside kick game was fun but Kinker is way too good at it.  Tyke is the only one who has a chance at beating him but really he doesn't either.  Oh yeah and Tyke's DDR outfit is really unmatchable.  Like this outfit is so hot it could burn the pants off a 4 year old girl (ewww by the way).  Wow that was a disturbing image.  And yet strangely arousing (haha).  The party got a little more reserved later and basically turned into Dr. Phil Lelee telling some great stories and then Tyke telling about his feelings for Tina and all.  That was fun.  Well it made him miss her more.  He pretended that she was there but in reality it was just two pillows he was holding while laying alone on the couch.  That is sort of a sad, yet funny, picture.  And at the same time strangely arousing...well this TY-ger's eyes are starting to hurt because he has been up a long time and been playing an endless amount of DDR.  But ladies do not forget...Tyke is on the prowl...pretty gay prowl...but he is hoping, nay searching hard for that one girl, that special girl, the girl he wants to spend the rest of his life (make that year) with.  Bye.  I love you all.  Not really.  A lot of you I am really only acquaintances with but some of you I hope to love soon and the others well you are alright.  Maybe we can hang out sometime.  Or talk online.  IM me whenever because it is always comforting to know that someone cares and wants to talk.  Once again...Bye.  :)
