Also funnily ironic are the letters to the editor in the mailbag section of news magazines:    "The writer of 'such and such an article' states that President Bush is a liar.  President Bush is NOT a liar...The author of this article should at least try to back his accusations up with fact!"    Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the author of this letter not backing up his or her statement with fact, just as he or she accused the journalist of doing?
