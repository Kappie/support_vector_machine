I already miss her and she just left this afternoon, its going to be a long week.  Today i went to band practice which went well when we finally got started, it was fun though.  Church was fun tonight, as usual, then after that we went out to go to the movies, guys night out, but then the little girls couldnt be home that late and couldnt watch a movie! How gay.  So we went to marble slab instead, it was goooood.
