Right now, I'm facing an identity crisis as I quest for the key to unlock the seal on my true personality... The solitary yet hopeless romantic, the Dreamer. The silent, perceptive mystic, the Seer. The hyperactive ranger, the Hunter.  These 3 characters make up my outside personality...servin to both conceal and protect the real person in my heart. Will I ever get through these guardians to unseal my true self...?  note: to read about my life exploits, look to http://sgstudents.com/forum/journal.php?s==474=view
