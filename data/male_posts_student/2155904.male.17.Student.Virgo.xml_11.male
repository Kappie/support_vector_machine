However for the most part the rest of his days go poorly.  He is soooo in love with Tina that it hurts.  But strangely enough he almost feels it is a good hurt.  He thinks that there isn't a better girl in the world that he could love and put all his soul into.  She is what keeps him from beating the shit out of their first period teacher and it is she that keeps him smiling and laughing all through the day.  Her face is his sky and her smile is his sun.  Without her smile he would surely die a frozen death and his soul would be left for the wolves who somehow manage to live without the sun.  But then again they are wolves.  But seriously, Tyke thinks the world of Tina and though he is mostly against her relationship with Kram because of his own longing for a relationship with her, he knows that there is nothing he can do but long for the day when he and Tina go to prom together.  Though this will not happen, just like she will not go to his soccer game even though she and Purdy said they would, he will continue to hope so and who knows, maybe this time she will come through with her promise.  She did say, when Tyke said that they would go to prom if he had his way, that she hopes he has his way.  That was a great day.  Every day with Tina is a great day.  Even if it is a day that starts out with Tyke and Tina walking to math together and then Tyke getting ditched for Kram.  Ditched isn't necessarily the right word because she did at least make it look like she felt bad/didn't want to just leave him by himself when she walked with her boyfriend.  But she still did ditch him.  But hey, they are going out and Tyke is just a guy that she can always count on for the rest of her life and one who believes that she can do no wrong in his eyes.  Even though if she killed someone that would be wrong but if it was accidental it would be fine.  But she would not do that.  She is the comforter on his bed who keeps him warm and cozy at night and who he wants to sleep with every night in his life.  Hehe.  Again, but seriously...Tyke+Tina=L4L (love for life).
