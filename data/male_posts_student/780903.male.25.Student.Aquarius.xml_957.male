And this probably came out a little mean, but rhyming is hard.  I don't really mean it.  Sorry.   "Do You Know That Gunner's GPA?"   Do you know that gunner's GPA? I hope it's 2.0, or something low and not OK. Do you know that gunner's GPA? Why can't he just sit still, I hope he will, die a gruesome way.  Sure, the lectures can be boring  But they're worse when front-row gunner speaks Every day, maybe twice, for thirteen weeks Words turn into paragraphs he spews With fancy words he doesn't know And sprinkled with offensive views  Do you know that gunner's GPA? I hope it's 2.0, or something low and not OK. Do you know that gunner's GPA? Why can't he just sit still, I hope he will, die a gruesome way.  Once or twice a week is fine, but Seven times an hour is too much Maybe one day he'll choke on his lunch And he sounds so smug and self-absorbed And there you sit and roll your eyes You never thought you'd be so bored  Do you know that gunner's GPA? I hope it's 2.0, or something low and not OK. Do you know that gunner's GPA? Why can't he just sit still, I hope he will, die a gruesome way.
