I think i was talking to nick and yeah he said no leader to lead us so it'll be leaderless...  2. I like the #2..it sounds kool but um there are alot of pros for being in smaller groups sometimes...Stronger freindship bonds are formed when in closer proximity of people...hehe proximity...nggaahhh neerrrrd!!  3. People may sometimes open up in smaller groups as there are not as many ppl there...i dunno...  Meh i don't mind whether we stick together or not for the time being except..it is gonna get bigger next yr.  Although 2 memebers are leaving moses, andrew, tim are joining.  I kno moses and tim are definites and there are probably more people coming so just bear all of this in mind people.  P.S Haha Chueck went to Yohan's birthday party...Did u go just for the food or did u go as a good friend?:P Haha one up on chueck.  Marky>
