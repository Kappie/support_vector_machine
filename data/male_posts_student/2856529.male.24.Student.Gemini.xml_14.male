The same day I also collected my last paycheck that the University of Louisiana at Lafayette would probably issue me unless I acquire a PhD degree and come back to the school to teach. That means that I am officially unemployed and part of a growing workforce in this country most of whom don't know how to react to the larger issues at hand such as the economic policy, outsourcing and debate over the hike in minimum wage.             The next day (i.e. yesterday) I went to experience paintball. I have seen the sport on several TV shows but did not really know what to expect. They give you these guns with paint pellets, which explode on contact and cover you with yellow paint. So much for Michael Moore's message for gun control in "Bowling for Columine". I played just about every scenario available, namely "Elimination", "Castle Capture" and "The City" and as you can imagine, I was eliminated quickly in just about every scenario. The elimination however was quite painful, as the pellets that struck me didn't really explode and bruised me considerably. It was in that moment of inner retrospect that I came up with the title for this blog. However this is not the end of my experiments with odd American pastimes. The next thing on my list is go-karting but I guess it will take sometime before that one materializes.
