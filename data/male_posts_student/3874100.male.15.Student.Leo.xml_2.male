Went downstairs, to see a piano on the hall, not bad, I should learn how to play that.    I played football for the first time in ageees today, my friend who's been in America for a few years moved back across the road, I'm not -that- bad, just pretty awful, considering his 10 year old sister totally owned me... but in my defence she's pretty good you know...  My parents went to some concert, and my sister went out, so I've been here on my own for the past 6/7 hours, and I've realised that I've done nothing, except do a bit of excercise, play guitar, and surf the net, but it felt like that time went quick, hmm...  I think I might actually leave the house tomorow, to see a friend...wow...  Anyway, if I do leave the house, something exciting might happen, like the time I saw a cloud, and it was an exact cuboid, with completely straight edges, and 90 degree corners, weird...  Keep on Truckin', Jonny
