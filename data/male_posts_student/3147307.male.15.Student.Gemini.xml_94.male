Anyways, lets see, I ran 5 miles today, I played 18 holes of golf (not great score of 84 - that's a 4.6 stroke average or almost double bogey every hole - I did hit the green twice on my first shot but three-putted and two-putted the holes so no birdies today), ate at Taco Bell (next to the golf course), came home, started to read the newspaper, fell asleep on the hard floor (I'm not quite sure how that happened) and woke up around 5. Now I'm here (aren't you so glad?)  David Letterman had his summer calendar last night (it was pretty funny) and I guess my quote will come from that: "July 24th: John Kerry names John Edwards his running mate at the Democratic National Convention. July 25th: Since the Convention is in Massachusetts, they decide to get married as well."
