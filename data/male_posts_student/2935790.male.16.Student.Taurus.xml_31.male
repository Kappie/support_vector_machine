I might be hosting it with my ISP or buying some cheap web space, but this means I need money.  I don't have a job yet, so if you have music/art/videos that you would like to contribute, I might have like a sign up page and members etc. and I'll host it all somewhere.  You get the idea.  No guarantees here, this is all hypothetical.  I will probably end up creating a large FTP on my hard drive and just using my PC as a server.  If you have any ideas or can help me with this, I'd gladly give you credit so drop me an IM at stringtheory@gmail.com on MSN Messenger.  Hooray!  Love, Sean
