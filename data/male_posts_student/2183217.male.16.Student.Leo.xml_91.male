Um it consists of pop songs sung by other artists, like Spice Girls covers and other cheesy stuff of that manner. Just before i was about to shoot it out, i decided to give it a listen for old times sake. Now as i listen to Mmmbop and Get Down sung by what sounds like drunk 15 year olds, i sit here wondering wtf im doing.
