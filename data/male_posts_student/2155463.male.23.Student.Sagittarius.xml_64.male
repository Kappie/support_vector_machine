Yeah, came out hittin a trey, dishin the rock (over the top!), gettin a steal, fillin it up on set-shots...heck, I even put down a alley-oop reverse layup (which just doesn't happen for me).  I was IN THE ZONE...of course, I'll probably go out next Tuesday and put up enough bricks to build a mansion...
