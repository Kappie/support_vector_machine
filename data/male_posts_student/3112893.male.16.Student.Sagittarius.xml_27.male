God seems to have given me the gift of being able to do it with speed and accuracy but I don't really take to it. I don't mind doing it if it's helping me solve some more interesting, tangible problem that I'm working on at the time, but just doing it for kicks seems stupid. Then again, I'm only just now getting to calculus so it might get better and more interesting as I get more advanced. We will see. Until then, I do what I must to get into the colleges of my choice. Today will be a long day*. At least it's not too slow... But then again, it's not very fun either.  That is all.         -- Feanor  *  8+ hours of math. That translates to about a third or fourth of the math done in a normal school year for me.
