For our class, we have to do on the characters Cinderella   by Norman Lim  , Rumpelstiltskin   by Yi Jing  , Baby Bear   by Bowen  , Goldilocks   by Mervyn Chng  , the Prince of Morocco   by Daryl Eng   and the Fairy Godmother   by Paul Ng   in the surprise setting on the mountaintop. We are given 45 minutes to write out the plot and dramatise and this is the storyline:        Once upon a time, in a land far far away,  Cinderella  married the  Prince of Morocco  in a royal wedding. Then,  Cinderella  realised that the  Prince of Morocco  was impotent. The  Prince of Morocco  said that if she did not spin a straw into gold, she will be banished from his country.  Cinderella  met  Goldilocks  and  Goldilocks  remarked, " Cinderella , you are so pretty and sexy!"  Cinderella  replied, "You are also sexy and chio too!" Hence, these two became very good playmates.      Then,  Cinderella  went to the mountaintop hoping to spin the straw into gold and return to her husband. When she climbed up, she commented, "I know the folks down there will want to see my underwear, so I didn't wear any!" Upon reaching the mountaintop, she met  Rumpelstiltskin  and they also fell in love with each other. As she tried spinning the straw into gold, the  Fairy Godmother  appeared.  Cinderella  wanted the  Fairy Godmother  to grant her wish and in the blink of an eye, the straw turned into gold!       At the same time, the  Fairy Godmother  got a crush on  Rumpelstiltskin  and seduced him! Since  Cinderella's  dream was fulfilled, she came back to her husband and they lived ever after.       How about  Goldilocks ? Yes, she met  Baby Bear  and  Baby Bear  said, "Were you the one who slept in my bed?" She replied yes and got married, and lived happily ever after.      Okay, after this, we have a round of Scrabble in which I am so lucky to place all seven tiles onto the board and score 81 points! ( HAHA !) I and some other classmates (pardon the grammar) watch Shakespeare in Love which is quite touching and how his love life inspired him to compose Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. It is an enjoyable day today!!!          WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!   COPYRIGHT Â© 2004 LEVIATHAN DREAMERS    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
