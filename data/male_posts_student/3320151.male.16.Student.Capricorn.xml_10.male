PArrrTAYYY! today = national day celebration.. omg it was actually super fun! acjc is damn laidback in its events such as this.. the whole school was standing on chairs and singing! wow! even the band joined hands with the choir (literally) and for the first time in a long time.. i enjoyed national day celebration. the j2s have are soo damn nice.. they bought a super bigload of presents and gave them to the j1s.. a more expensive undertaking than vice versa because there are simply more j1s than j2s.. their effort deserves mention! presents ranged from the yummy variety to the not so yummy ( can cds be eaten?) type... but ANYway.. i want to say i will misssss them alot. not really till tears.. but just alot. the science especially.. because the arts i can, as i said many times before, just walk downstairs and see them. its sooo cool.. now i finally noe y i love the school.. its because arts is tighter and more cohesive a unit than any other.. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...... =)  watched farenehit 9/11 after that with (in order of merit)... me,me and me. the others (not in order of merit) include jian xiang, yoon hoe, jocelyn, angel, huiying, jonathan + y^2 thieng.! =) haha it was the most evvviieeelll show on earth.. making fun of poor old george bush.. what the hell.. reading 'my pet goat' while people were jumping off the wtc.. omg man such a cool dude. actually i love the movie cos it only shows 1 point really... there is no god. poor woman.. poor deluded woman. ah well.. i better not be too mean. heh.  Ok..... to sum it all up.. i think this is the funnest + funniest day in acjc.. i love band! (these chicks dont even know the name.. *faddeee OUTttt....*
