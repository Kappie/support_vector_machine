Admittably, that was spontaneous and random, but it is rather satisfying to decide, to mandate myself to go to MUS on Thursday. I have been harassed by a few of the theater kids who are performing there. *cough cough Elise and Heather* I simply kid thee ladies, worry not. But both shall be pleased to know that I  will  be coming. To watch it. All of it. Nya.  I feel guilty. Elise has a sore throat, even as she is rehearsing tonight. Damn my curfew and homework load, for I cannot bring her a pint of ice cream to sooth her throat. Damn.  Elise lent me the Ben Folds Five (Live) CD for burning a quasi-bootleg copy that isn't really quasi-bootleg illegal because we bought it together. This makes me happy.   Listening to:  One Down (by Ben Folds - what did you expect?)  I don't know what occurred this morn, but I suddenly became drastically physically self-conscious. For example: I began to loathe my haircut for no good reason. Then I got worried about the fat distribution on my arms and neck. Then I panicked like hell. In homeroom, which is not the best of times to panic. But I restrained it.  Another reason that I am a perfect application for being fucked-up.  Before I eradicate it from my memory, I was Johannes Kepler today in pre-Calculus. That's okay if you have no bloody idea who he is. But he proposed the three theories of helicentricity building on the Copernican theory, which Newton eventually used in his principles, dealing with the orbits of planets, in which the orbit will be an ellipse (equation x-squared/a-squared + y-squared/b-squared = 1) with a and b the distance from the center of the orbital pattern to the closest and farthest point on the ellipse, and the sun as a focus  , meaning that a line drawn from the center from the focus sun to the variable planet will cover the same area in a set amount of time, denoting that the planet will gain speed as it nears the focus  , and that the sidereal period T squared will be proportional to the semimajor axis R (in astronomical units, naturally) cubed, so that an equation will be T sub-a squared / T sub-b squared = R sub-a cubed / R sub-b cubed, and the equation for a single planet will thus be reduced to T=kR to the 3/2, and in such, the period of Mercury, roughly .24 of a year (earth year, of course) squared, will be .06, set over the sidereal period of earth, squared, approximately 1.000, and this ratio will be equivalent to the semi-major axis of Mercury cubed (.39 to the third will equal .06) set, again, over the semi-major axis of earth cubed, and as this quantity will be the one astronomical unit from earth to the sun cubed, it will equal 1.000, so, thus, .06/1.000 (this is T)=.06/1000 (this is R), and .39 (semimajor axis) to the 3/2, quantity times the constant  k , which equals 1,  will come out to .24, which is the sidereal period.  Did you catch all that? Good. I demonstrated this to the calss as Kepler. Much fun.  Lemonade is good. Homework is bad. Cheers, mortals.
