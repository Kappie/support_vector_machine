Whats up?  Anyways.  Yah I'm tired of people who like, act all happy and crap.  You can't be happy  all  the time can you?  I mean seriously.  They're like happy even if they're friend is dying in front of them.  They'd be like "But look on the positive side!"  WHAT THE HELL IS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF DYING DAMNIT!?  GOD DAMNIT HELP ME!  DON'T JUST STAND THERE!  Jeez.  And people who don't blink bug me too.  They just like....stare at you.  and its creepy.  I'm like "Ummm, could you like, blink or something?"  Too many freaks, not enough circuses....Well I'm ranted out, Ta.
