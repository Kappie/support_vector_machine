It is full of charm and PERFECT for two gay guys to decorate!!  I'll keep you up to date on the progress with closing.  (Also, the reason for the title of this blog is the house being in the 100 year flood plane.  In Abilene, about half the town is marked as flood zone because of the possibility of the 100 year flood.  This is a massive flood that has never, to my knowledge, actually occurred but supposedly could occur.  Therefore, we get to pay extra money to the insurance just in case it ever does!)  Anyway...I'll try to get to posting another installment in my life journey series soon.  Finally for fun...I have come upon an eternal question:  You are in a public restroom... You are male... You are at the urinal... There is a penny in the bottom of the water... The penny is heads up... It is a lucky penny... To see it and walk away would be bad luck for years... You have already used the restroom... Is the penny still lucky?... Can you safely walk away... Lets just say that I personally hope so.  :)
