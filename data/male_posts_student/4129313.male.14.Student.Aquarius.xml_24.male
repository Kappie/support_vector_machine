I need you to give me some good idea's, and help me implement new things to my side bar. I'd also like to take the other 2 rounder's templates and implement them as alternate styles like for firefox users and stuff. (I think i know how, I just need to steel the CSS and link to it externaly right?) I look forward to your help, and I hope somebody takes an interest in reading about me. I highly doubt it though :(
