This time i just woked up early and went and took a 3 and something hours test. At least i hope i did fine, fine beacuse i didn't studied for more than two hours. And it was kind of hard since it was in my second language, english. The math sections were fine it was just in the verbal sections where i don't  know how i did.   Hopefully i don't have to take it again, they are making the next SAT harder. I'll wait and see what happens, and fuck i still have to pass the english taks test =(...
