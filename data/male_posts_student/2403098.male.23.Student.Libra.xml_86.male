I also have a mirror in my shower for shaving, because I have to shave IN the hot steam or I will razor burn the fuck out of my face.  (Blonde hair, fair skin, blah blah, skin like paper, rashes occur from the simplest of things as do sunburns, etc.)  I'm getting off-track.  So, shower, shower radio, mirror in shower.    Confession:          Showers = Karaoke-Time; Mason Style.  While I shave, while I wash, while I scrub-a-dub, I sing so loudly to ANYTHING that is on the radio that the neighbors surely hear me.  I don't have an awesome voice.    Here's where the mirror comes in:  I look in the mirror while I'm singing sometimes and make extreme faces at it.  You know, the kind of faces someone would make when they were singing so loud and hard that it looks like they're in pain.  The mirror is my audience and sometimes... yeah, sometimes the shaving gel canister is my microphone.  There, I said it.  I had to get it off my chest.  I sometimes wonder about the things "we" as people do in private when no one is around.  Like, what if there was a camera on you and someone saw the weird stuff you do alone?  Not that singing in the shower is that odd, but just funny.  Like the times I talk to myself when I go in a room and forget why I'm in there and say "what did I come in here for" outloud.  Or when I have entire one-sided conversations with my dog about things like the weather and how much I hate school?    Anyway, I came out of the bathroom just now after my shower, opened the bathroom door, and Boomer was staring at me, like he was concerned about what might have been causing the commotion inside the bathroom while I showered.  It was then that I knew I had a problem.
