Could this be a new direction for QAF?  One thing that has been good is Ted Schmit getting into rehab for his "self medicating"; for a moment then I was expecting an overdose (OD) and possibly a death (gah!), but its good to see that the shows creators are showing that if you have recognised that you're addicted to a substance, there are those who you can turn to for help. Hopefully this show will go down well, and wake a few up.  On the funny front;  "Dr. Robert Spitzer found only 200 long-term ex-gays in all of North America in his 2001 study, despite extensive help from Exodus in searching for "thousands" of ex-gays."* , there are "so many" of these ex-gay people, poor old Exodus "lost track". And for the translation, "200 ex-gays who were actually bi-sexual but assumed that there is only gay and straight; thus they assumed they must be gay because the like men".  * Information Sourced from  urlLink Ex-Gay Watch   I've added the Ex-Ex-Gay link for those who like to keep up to date in the ex-gay hypocrisy. To be completely blunt, these people are like the evangelical preachers who go from town to town with their revivals and false miracles promising salvation but all they really do is make peoples wallets that little bit lighter.  These people may think they're helping, but they're not and parents who actually believe in this mumbo-jumbo simply perpetuate the problem even more. Let me make this perfectly clear, there is no "cure" to homosexuality; your cards have been dealt, deal with it. Have and look at me (for example); 22 years old, well adjusted, great job and studying moving foward.   Do I "feel" a desire to be straight? Heck no, because quite frankly, to wish to become something that is never going to possible is like a person dreaming that if they've always wanted to be a dog instead of a human knowing full well that no matter how much they desire it to be so, they will never be a dog.  Yes, as one is coming out, one wonders whether their feelings are "normal" and whether they can change; I've moved beyond that point in my life. I know who I am, and to be completely honest, I certainly don't need to have an entourage of "supporters" following me, like the ex-gays tend to.  But then again; these ex-gays are like reformed smokers, they claim that since they can do it, everyone else should follow them. Sorry, if us "fags" like who we are, the likes of Haley can run off and suck on a popsicle if all I care. The fact is, not one supposed "study" and "followup" ever defines whether the person is actually gay or just bisexual, but then again, it would ruin their industry if all they can say is that they make bisexual people more heterosexual.
