I dont know if after SYT, beginning this monday, "What Was I On?!" will be picked up for a second season. Depends on if the writer can bother his ass which is right now thinking maybe not.  David's confused. Ive been through some fucking mass of emotional shit today because he told nicola stuff last nite about how he feels as if hes been rushed (which is very unfary considering i havent pushed for ANYTHING! Not a minute!). Anyway, she was apparently "allowed to tell me if she wanted to", and she did this morning. I am so fucking angry and could actually cry, i think. I understand, coz ive been there myself with the whole confusion thingy, and i know this isnt an easy time for him either, but even when i tried to talk to him tonight i was ignored for ages, then told that he and Sarah wer watching a movie, then ignored summore, then finally told that Sarah sed he was to log out coz people talking was disturbing the movie. Why cant he talk to me? Why do i have to hear about his problems with me through Nicola? Is this a threeway fucking relationship or what?! Does he not want me? Was it Tuesday that put him off? Was it seeing me topless that did it? HES FUCKING CONFUSED!!!
