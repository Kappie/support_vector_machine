Monday I worked all day, took a walk around the block during lunch and then after work I went to dinner and Wegmans with Linda.  She had a craving for junk food (and me being a junk food expert) I wanted to help.  We ate at Wendy's for under $5 together and then she spent $70 on groceries.  I spent $12.  Seeing how she's 2 feet shorter than me, it seems a bit unbalanced, but hey, I'm cheap.  I meant to go to the gym but I couldn't find the time.  I wanted to go for a run but I couldn't find the energy.  This morning I woke up at 6 and Linda and I went to the public market, which by the way is REALLY empty at 6am.  Best to come at 7 or 8am after they've all set up.  But I got everything I wanted (but the prices were a little bit more than I'd hoped).  I came back, fell asleep and then went to work.  Blah, I'm here now. :)
