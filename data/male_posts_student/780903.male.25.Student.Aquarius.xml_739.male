It's a balanced article -- not saying these sites are great or awful, but that they exist and all sorts of people are on there.  I could go for an easy joke here, probably involving Michael Jackson; I could try something more ambitious, like fake profiles for a bunch of law student personality types (and, in fact, I'll probably try that later and see what happens); or I could make this one of those posts where I tell you actually how I feel about something and aren't necessarily trying to be funny but use the word "peanut butter" somewhere in there for a laugh.  Read the article; take a little nap; when you come back before the night is over there'll be something here, either trying to be funny or not, depending on how quickly the Robitussin I just took kicks in and stops my nose from running.  (There's also a really interesting article about  urlLink John Edwards  and behind-the scenes preparing for one of the Democratic debates.  I like this kind of stuff.  Once again, the NY Times Magazine stopping me from doing real work.  Cool.
