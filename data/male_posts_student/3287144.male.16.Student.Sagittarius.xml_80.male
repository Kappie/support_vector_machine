I feel so utterly lost - most of my friends are away on holiday as well which leaves me a skeleton crew with which to go running to with my problems. I might have to rename my blog 'The Fall and Fall of Mr Stephen Pearson' from the 'Misadventures' - but the later also seems appropriate right now.  I was looking forward to seeing her so much it has come as a stronger blow than what it should have - but then again it does mean I am going to be stuck around Cheltenham with nothing to do but contemplate it over the coming days.
