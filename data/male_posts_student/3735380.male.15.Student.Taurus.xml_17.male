Did you know that at least 10% of junk mail is pornographic, while the rest is mortages and ads? Well now you know. So what happens when an unsuspecting minor (age under 18) opens one of those pornographic ads? Nobody sues the company? Nobody even bothers threatening a freaking lawsuit on "the blue pill", when that's a legitimate case for a lawsuit?!? That's surprising.  Every day there are more than 10 billion spam mails per day. The number is growing. Why doesn't someone take care of this? Are ISPs really idiotic thinking they can create a box for spam, instead of making a simple test to answer? A test! That's it!  There have been service sign-up techniques that make positive you're not a robot. These tests are incorrect at a rate of 0% during its entire existence. That's 100% accuracy right there. What is it? It's a messy image text test. Yup! You heard me. A messy image text test. The simplest test in the world. The best part is that it takes less than 5 seconds. Below is an example.        Messy images, huh? Why not implant them into e-mails so you're not spammed to death? It's really fun to sit back, look at the world, and laugh. Why didn't they think of this in the first place?  I'll tell you something. Humans are not the smartest creatures. They will need to hand-sort the e-mail before they come to the messy image test, that for so long has been hidden in the depths of "Get me on the e-mail send page".  I guess we'll just have to live with it until some ISP discovers this.
