The main reason being that my mum's been telling me how I must tidy my room, and help clean the house in general, as yesterday I mentioned I was bored. I knew I would regret saying that. So, I vacumed my bedroom, and sorted out my wardrobe, to get rid of old clothes that no longer fit, and also just re-aranged all my clothes in general. Things look so much better when re-arranged. :) I was then told off by my sister for using the vacuum at 8:20 in the morning, so I stopped, deciding to do it later. I then did it later. So, with a (fairly) clean room, I had a go on the computer, and made an attempt at re-earning my  urlLink neopets  fortune. Made a bit o' money, which I will continue to do through the summer, and try to get a good house, and maybe train my pet up a bit. Yes, it is a total waste of time, but very satisfying.  Well, that was the morning, and then came the afternoon. Altough tidying the front room only one week ago, my mum still insisted that it was messy, so we ended up cleaning and organising that for most of the afternoon, which was far from fun. But I suppose worthwhile, as it is now almost spotless, with only a few hints of the fact that a family live here. And then came the evening. Whence I decided it was time for a blog, not having done one today. And here it is. Not a great one, but probably not the worst, just turning into waffle now really, so I guess I'll give it a rest for another day, most likely tomorrow.  But before I go, I will take my time to mention that several good films are on tv tonight. Firstly, starting at 2000, X Men, a fairly good film, featuring 'Jean Luc Picard', this guy here:   who, according to  urlLink dickybod , looks just like me. Can't think why, he's old, and bald, and I have neither of those characteristics. Actually, it's not really him in the film, more this person:   The same actor, of course.  Anywho, after X Men, depending on how tired I am, I may watch 'True Lies', a good Arnie film, full of guns and explosions, which are of course what his films are all about. Some mildly ammusing parts in it though. Doesn't finish 'til 1 in the morning though, but meh, I'm not doing anything tomorrow.  And I will have to video 'The Thing... From Another World', a 1950s sci-fi horror film about aliens, on at the same time as 'True Lies'. It sounds quite funny...  Well, that shall be all for now, toodles all.  Bye all.   Weather:  Sunny, some clouds. Not too warm though  Reading:  Reaper Man, Terry Pratchett  Listening to:  Rolf Harris - Two Little Boys  Watching:  X Men, True Lies, The Thing... From Another World, later  Confused about:  Why mum has to be soooo tidy  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  Not so bad
