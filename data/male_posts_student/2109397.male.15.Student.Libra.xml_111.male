I took a crack at about everybody today everytime I went in on a slide i ended up knocking someone over, including the varsity coach lol. They need to learn that they're supposed to jump over me unless they want to get cracked. So the rest of practice people backed off of challenges against me.   Other than that I did nothing today. Sam invited me over but my mom decided I couldnt go, although she had no god damn reason.   Also question for the 5 people who read this. Should I get "GK" on the back of my hoodie or the number 1?
