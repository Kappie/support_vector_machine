I had been drinking again haha.  I have an exam tomorrow, it is an English one so i am not going to worry about it too much.  3 paragraph essay wupp di do. Today i went to the beach it was pretty warm out, actually extremely.  All the babes comforted me though haha.  Shaved my face for the first time today, feels extremely soft haha, I cant wait to grow it out in the summer.  I did not do much in uo yesterday, not many people on, i did steal some items to tick people off because it is extremely funny to me.  Right now i am at my grandparents so I have no access to the game so it really sucks.  My grandparents got home today, so hot.  I feel like an insomniac right now, i have huge bags under my eyes and extremely exhausted but do not goto bed.  When i get home i will do some homework review for math, it is all due tuesday!  Wow school is going by fast, only 1 week left then 2 months of complete relaxation.  Now all i need is an air conditioner for my tiny computer room....Ha i wish.  Its actually a pretty boring day, but still none the less extremely hot.  I cannot wait for the game Half-Life 2 to come out i have been waiting for it ever since it was announced to be made, and then the person hacked and stole the source code (fuckers).  Now i have to wait until like July, but it is going to be extremely worth it.  Chris listening to: nothing thinking: why am i so exhausted and, man was last night worth it
