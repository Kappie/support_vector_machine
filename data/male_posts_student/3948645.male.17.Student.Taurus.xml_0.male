For about the entire month of june I only played it maybe 2 times a week for only a couple hours, mainly cause I was bored with it and was playing other games. But recently I have been playing everyday and it keeps getting better. I went from lvl 12 warrior to lvl 15 warrior in about 3 hours while in a party, and believe that is really good. And today I got to lvl 5 monk in 2 hours. This game is definitely a good one. I just cant wait until lvl 18 for my warrior. Then I can go on a quest for a subjob. Meaning I could be a warrior/red mage, warrior/ monk, or whatever else i want to be. I highly recommend this game if you like RPG's (Role Playing Games.) And if you have a lot of time on your hands, because this game definitely takes time to play. So if you buy this game, let me know, I can buy a world pass for you, so you can play on the same server as me (unicorn.) Its a lot easier to play it, when you know others.
