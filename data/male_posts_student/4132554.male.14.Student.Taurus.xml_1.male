Imagine washing your face every thirty minutes just to stay awake to study L.E., the music treatment didn't work..   Our test in A.P. was somewhere between easy and moderate, apparently, the freak wasn't the one who made the test..   I had lunch with my classmates in elementary.. Man, I wish hanging out with those guys.. They surprised me with the major changes in their school life, one of them already has a girlfriend.. But, Benjamin, the one from II-6, haven't changed a bit.. He is still immature, and he was our laughing stock.. Hehehe.. I'm looking forward to hanging out with them again..   After hanging out with my former classmates, I joined my present classmates.. That's when my day starts to fall apart.. My classmates are all seated and I tried finding a seat, then I saw an empty chair at the last table.. Actually, It was not empty, there were bags there. I asked my classmates if they own the bags.. Nobody claimed it, so I decided to slam that chair at the side and replaced it with an empty chair for me to sit in.. I guess I chose the wrong time to slam that chair, because the owner of the bags were there... She was an old woman and she looked at me as if I killed an innocent baby.. I was freaking!! I didn't know what to do... My conscience ate me, eventually I apologized to the person...  That was just the first part of the torture.. I was late for my chinese class, and my teacher was furious!! She said that I'm irresponsible!! Because I haven't recited the summary of the movie, tarzan, for her.. And she said that I have no reason to be late!! Whatever..   Then she distributed the test papers, I didn't expect high grades.. But I messed up an essay.. I was confused, my answer was for a diiferent question.. So, I lost eight points.. GRRRRR....  Second recess came, the best part of the afternoon, I went to my classmates.. Thinking that they might relieve my burden.. I felt so much better.. But the down part is, I didn't noticed the time, so I came late for the third period.. And my teacher has gone ballistic!!! She said: you're the first one to go out!! And you're late!! Actually, there were more.. Fortunately, I didn't understand the next words!!! Hehe... I devoted the rest of my third period counting the minutes before the bell.. It felt like a month!! Then, I heard the most beautiful sound, I heard the bell!! (translation: yeeeeey!!) I felt like a newly released prisoner..  I thought that my bad luck was over, I thought wrong!! I still have to hide from Sir Judelio, I am hiding from him because of my untidy haircut.. grrr....  Then, I saw Jill, Toni, Kim Carmela and Michelle... I joined the group.. And a Chinese teacher approached us.. She was the weirdest teacher I have ever seen!! She talked to us with PASSION... She laughs after every sentence.. The teacher left us and talked to Jill's mom.. Then, the weird teacher laughed histerically!! She was laughing with PASSION.. it was the fuuniest thing I have witnessed!! I laughed and laughed...  My day turned upside-down... I was smiling all the way to my house!!  That's all  Velasco, OUT!!!
