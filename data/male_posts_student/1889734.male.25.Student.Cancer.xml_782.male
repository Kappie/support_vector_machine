And the United States must lead the way if such exploration is to benefit mankind. Whatever nation harvests the vast bounty of the cosmos fisrt will reap a bounty so great it cannot be overcome. This is like the great voyages of discovery of Columbus, Magellan, Cook and others. Rather, the elevator is a tool as important as the compass rose. With it, we can build space vehicles with no need for non-space flight. Costs will go down and utility will rise.  I ask myself how anyone can begrudge the paltry $10 billion this project is estimated to cost? This needs to be done, and the sooner the better.
