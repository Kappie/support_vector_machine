Patrick (Paprika), Erin (Vivica), Katie (Katarina), Emily S. (Aemalysa), Jeremy (Jeronimo!), Jenny (Rho), Emily B. (Evangeline), and Zane (Z, Zeke) all came by.  We ate some pizza and cinammon sticks, then watched  Bringing Down the House  with Steve Martin and Queen Latifah before playing some Taboo (which can get pretty crazy if you don't watch out).  It was a lot of fun, I have to say.  It's good to have friends.  Clean-up really wasn't that bad.  My dog got a hold of some chocolate, though, so he'll get pretty sick later on.  That sucks.  Tomorrow I should go out to help with traffic directing at the Baylor graduation, but I'm pooped, so I'm not sure if I'll wake up in time.  I'm not going to set my alarm ;-).  Besides, I need to get a head start on continuing reading  Quinze Ans  and  La casa en Mango Street , finishing  Pillow Songs , finishing my application to B. Dalton, finding more applications, studying Italian some more, figuring out what kind of gifts I can give out for Christmas, and more.  Yeah, I have a long weekend ahead of me, but you know what, ¡extá bien porque estamos cerca de la Navidad!  Ok, I know that was just a really bad case of Spanglish, but I don't care.  It's late.  Time to go sheepy-poo :-).
