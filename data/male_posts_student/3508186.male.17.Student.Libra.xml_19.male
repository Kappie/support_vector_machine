She has effected me and I am now expressing that effect.    The world seems open, far to wide for one person to matter.  I see everyday people doing everyday things and I wonder if I'll ever talk to them, or influence them at all.  Then I look back on all my friends, how I did or did not effect them as individuals.  Some were just fake friends, people who saw me every once in awhile and thought they were my friend.  I guess I was their friend, if it mattered at all.  The term friend seems like it descibes people you know when it should be used to describe people you effect.  There is so many people in this world that it seems hard to change the lives of just a few.  I'm glad for my friends, past and present that have jumped in my life and stayed awhile or departed soon after.    Departed sounds like death, so I'll try not to use it so much for that.     Well, I discused many things with Kassandra, one of which was seeing into the future.  If I could see I could changed it for the better.  But that may turn to the worst (Butterfly Effect) and end up horrible.  What I was mostly focusing on was relationships.  To think that one person dates another, and then moves on.  It seems like this is not the way things should be.  It seems that God had a plan, and now it's ruined.  It's almost like he wanted to see how far we could go, only to find out his way of our existence and procreation has been lusted apon and dragged through hell.  So my main reason for wanting to know the future is to know how things or relationships will turn out, will they be happy with the occasional mishap, or will it end and be looked apon as a mistake.  Should I know, do I really want to know.  I have thought about it and I dont care.  I will do my best to figure things out.  I will try.
