Wasn;t today fucking nuts!?! i feel like jerking off or something to celebrate...but i'll save  THAT  for later....anyway, if your reading thing (all 6 of you) your more than likely looking for some intresting reading...well you know what? i'm here to facking give it to ya...thats right... facking .  Well, ok, i had a crazy fucking night...my lil' brother wouldn't stop fucking around, so i ended up falling asleep at like 12...then, for some reason, i woke up at 5...so ya, i wasn;t to happy about that. but then i went back to sleep, just to be awake again at like 6:15....so yeah, my morning wasn't exactly like those  urlLink folger guys.  (ROFL, go to that link...made funny music....), my mornign was more like what  urlLink this guy  must go through.  Bu ya, i still went to school.  First period went with out a hitch...turned out today was a B day instead of A, so i only had a single.  Next period, went down to caf after quick meeting with 2 gym teachers and a guidance counseler.  Then spanish went by, that went pretty cool, and after that, double of earth science, which was pretty  boring .  the only thing keeping me awake is when i check out shawna. mmmmmmmmmmmm, shawna.....that kinda makes me wanna say  urlLink this.  well, anyway, then some other shit happened.....nothign important really....um...ya, pretty much it, stopped buy video room again, everything was juss wierd.  I dunno.  Anyway, then i stopped by messina's wit andy, where we also discussed at waht time we were gonna go to  urlLink NYSC.  he agreed at maybe five...he called, but i still couldn't go, tied up with work, he said he was heading over at 6, so it wads all good. BUT, i ended up going to sleep until 7:30, so yeah...i missed out on going to da gym, but w/e, i'll juss try to push it overtime tomarrow....it;'s tuesday tomarrow, which means benny is working....whihc means after that, gina get's there, but, i'm totally over that.  I think its' the fact that SHE's OUT OF MY leauge that helped me in the "getting-over" process. So ya, thats the end of that. In other news, i hate HW...THIS JUSS IN...i still dun like it....i had mad shit to do today, but didn;t finish ANY of it..i'mgonna have to pull off a miracle tomarrow....or juss some cuts...well, ya, if i didn't mention anythign it;s cause i just forgot, or am to lazy to do it....well, let's see what tomarrow holds...PEACEZORZ
