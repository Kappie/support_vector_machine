One would hope in a lifetime there are more happy endings than unpleasant beginnings and that not all good things come an end.  Some would argue the start has little bearing and that the course outweighs the outcome in importance.  In saying so, how do you take your journey?  Each and every step planned in advance of the next?  Eyes closed with finger in the air, wind carrying ya forward?  Choice or chance, methodical or whimsical, can one harness both?  Methodically choosing chance?  I like it, let's see how it works.
