Finally, I decided I had to confront Evil.  I had to see what they did, and have my rage confirmed.  I can't put words to what I've seen.  It's like a wordless scream of rage and hatred boiling out of me.  Nick Berg screamed as they sawed at his neck.  It goes on and on, all the while these animals are chanting Allahu Akbar over and over again.  It is like staring into hell.  Where is this God that is so great?  This is Evil.  There is nothing more to say when describing it.    It confirms my disgust at a culture and religion that can promote this.  What sort of culture mires itself in the seventh century?  Islam delenda est.    Marcus Cato in the Third Punic war set out a simple concept.  "Carthago delenda est."  Carthage must be destroyed.  The Romans razed it to the ground, killed every man, and sold every woman and child into slavery.  They salted the ground and eradicated all traces of Carthage.  Rome was never bothered by them again.  Islam delenda est.  Watch the video, and tell me how we can coexist with Islam.  Explain to me how this is morally equivalent to Abu Ghraib.  Explain to me why I shouldn't beat someone senseless when they say Nick Berg deserved this?  There isn't much more to say that will be coherent in my current state.  I believe this should be aired on TV, at least once.  We should all confront this.  We should all understand what we are facing in the world.
