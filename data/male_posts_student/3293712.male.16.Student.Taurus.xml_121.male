Except maybe move it closer, say about the Westgate Mall, so we’re not using half a tank to get there.  I also want to hear what the Hobster has to say. Or really, anyone. It’s basically me and Mattson who post here, John occasionally rants about something or other…  BTW, I received Hardest Worker (Varsity) and Most Improved Singles (Varsity) at the tennis banquet. Y’all should’ve come, ‘specially Johnny, since he lettered and won Most Improved Doubles (JV). Hobster had to take all his stuff… he also lettered and won Most Improved Doubles (Varsity).  I’ll read that book, sounds like a good read. I hope to get into some good, deep stuff this summer. I stayed up half the night last night reading Stranger in a Strange Land, very good. Maybe reading classics like this will help me find myself. If nothing else, it gives me a boost for Knowledge Bowl, which, by the way, you should join, Mattson and John. I’m gonna work hard and play hard, especially when it comes to Halo. I read the Halo 2 preview in Holby’s magazine and I almost died of awesomeness poisoning. Destructible environments and vehicles, double wielding, new weapons, hijacking vehicles… I’ma explode.  However, I must strongly disagree with you on some points. Being punk yourself, you feel that society is NOT the ultimate judge of a person. This viewpoint IS the very essence of being punk – the sheer individualism of free will. However, the only time which it is not are cases of complete isolation from society or living in a drastically dynamic social environment in which individuals play little role in relation to the whole; you don’t have a certain group of people that judge you, its just strangers on the street. Otherwise, the group of individuals, whether 4 close friends or all of BHS, that associate themselves with you regularly, makeup the social unit that is the actual judge of you, socially. Truly, only YOU know exactly yourself. You may be completely different inside than you are on the outside. But, if this outside is all society sees, it is all they can judge you by. A strong reinforcement here comes from our continuation to call Jarid a poser. He may be a poser, he may not. I feel he’s a better skateboarder than many, since he’s worked at it and likes to do it. Still, the label sticks, at least among us. Regardless of Jarid’s self-image, hardly even “deceiving himself” anymore since he has significant skill, he cannot do anything to change our perception of him. He is, and will remain, a poser, at least to us, until he does something to change our views otherwise. To clear up what I meant, when I said “what you ARE” I meant what your social distinction is, whether prep, jock, pseudopunk, slut, whatever. Your social distinction is solely classified by what society defines you as; that is basically its definition. Being, as you are, “punk,” your feelings that society doesn’t control you are completely in line. Your rejection of society’s hold on you and ability to control your social status makes you punk. In your comments on my second point, you shift speakers a few times, going from ‘you’ to ‘we’ and finally to ‘I.’ Not to be offensive, but my comments really didn’t concern you. They were mainly directed at pseudopunks. You say, “Why compromise your values and beliefs to get invited to a few more social functions?” I don’t, or try not to. But many people, VERY many people do. “We don't seek acceptance from societies or groups, though. We seek acceptance through individuals.” Maybe you do. But not necessarily everyone. Politicians do not seek acceptance by individuals – it is much more efficient to project their message to societies and groups. They can’t do exactly what any one person wants, so they appease the group in their best manner. Finally, “I could care less what the vast majority of people think of me, but there are people that I listen to and care about.” That’s you. That’s not everyone else, the vast majority that you speak of who does want acceptance from the vast majority.   At the top, you speak of how parents “brainwash” their children. This is definitely wrong. Parents provide the sole education for a child preceding formal schooling. It is the job of a parent to teach their children what is right, and, therefore, project their own ideas of what is right onto their child. They only do what they think is right. Their children, being malleable as little children, follow and listen and learn, and, pleasing their parents (one of the most rock-solid and sturdy social groups with which any person interacts throughout their life), they gain acceptance. However, their scraping of stickers was awfully immature. Though retaliation would just lower you to their level, it may be the only thing that gets though to them, like spanking a young child. By all means, bring back the rod! I haven’t seen Starship Troopers, the movie, but I read the book. It’s decent, but it’s heavily sci-fi, and while it makes a presumption of being intellectual, it truly can’t get past the sci-fi aspects, not to mention a horrible and flat ending that really kills it with little resolution. In case you’re wondering, it involves corporal punishment, and I heartily agreed with some points it brought up, regardless of how fultily unrealistic they are.  Am I punk. I don’t know. I don’t know what society thinks of me. Well, yes, I know I’m smart and nice, a huge nerd most likely, possibly preppy, with a good sense of humor, and a strong Catholic faith. That’s just what I’ve gathered. But it would be something to know what everyone really thinks of me. Analogy: I feel I’m a fairly good tennis player. I watch other players play, often ones that I have beaten. I watch them play, and say “If I’m better than this player, who I see as playing quite well, I must be pretty good myself.” Then something comes up like the All-Sports Banquet video, and I see myself playing tennis. I don’t look good at all. I spot loads of things about myself that need changing. Basically what I’m trying to say is, taking a new perspective on yourself provides a lot of deep insight into what society thinks of you, and how it matches up to your self-image, for better or for worse. All I know is that punk, to me, carries many negative connotations. I have a picture I got off the internet that I use in my “We Didn’t Start the Fire” video, the one I display as Mr. Joel sings “punk rock.” I’ll try and describe it in less than a thousand words: Theres the MTV logo and stuff in the bottom left. On the right, this guy wears a raggedly black hooded sweatshirt with Oriental-style writing, offering the camera a piece of cheese pizza while dementedly sticking out his tongue to show how the piercing there complements the ones in his nose and lip. On the left, this girl with a tall black mohawk smiles over at him, wearing a studded black leather jacket over a shirt with a green oval and words in it that I can’t make out. Behind her is another girl, wearing a big Cheshire cat grin while she holds a cut-out of an astronaut upside down. She wears a collar and black-and-red striped socks, and has nose piercings and obvious tatooes. That whole thing just creeped me out.   Finally, as your eyes must be hurting by now, one last comment, going on about predestination vs. free will. It’s again, all in the perspective. From God’s point-of-view, everything is predestined – He knows, before we are born, whether we are going to heaven or hell. Impossible, you say. Well, God created time, so it’s obviously no boundary to Him. But from our POV, the only one that really matters, since nobody here is God, we have free will, the ability to change our environment. God knows what we will do. It’s sort of hard to grasp. Even if we try to not do what we think He knows we will do, we are still doing what He knows we will do. Sort that out, if you can. It is as a result of this free will that some people do go to Hell. Why would God create us with free will if it meant some would go to Hell? Why would he put us in this world of pain and horrible temptation if there was a chance he would lose us? Well, as Mattson puts it, pressure makes diamonds. God wants us to love and to be loved, and love cannot exist without free will. I’ll stop before I get into any sort of trouble.
