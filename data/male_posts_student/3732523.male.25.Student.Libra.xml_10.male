I said I was going to wait till early next year to re-evaluate the whole house situation, since the previous encounter was very fustrating and unsettling.  But then before we knew it, we're thinking about putting a bid on a house.  Not completely sure if we're going to take it.  The price is perfect (Same as what I pay for rent right now).  But there is a bit of work to do to it, cosmetic and structure-wise (The foundation has a bit of unsettling, they said they could fix it before we moved in).  We're looking at a few more options, but might be moving in sooner then I think.  We're going to think about it very hard this week, and make a decision.  -- Things  Lately, my mind has been so scattered.  I will start working on one thing, then all of a sudden, I forget what I was doing before.  Fire just laughs at me when I'm typing something on TCZ and all of a sudden I just either end the sentance prematurely or just add a who and the end of it.  Heh, I find it pretty funny myself as well, but I think I seriously need a few days off work just to relax around the house and do some serious binge drinking.  Luckily I have extra money and we're coming up to a 4 day weekend!  (July 1st = Canada Day).  Mucho relaxo and golfo, with a side order of drinko.    Thats all for now  Bie!
