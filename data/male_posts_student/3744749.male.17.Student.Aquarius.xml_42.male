There's something about being called "Junior" by a person who is at least two feet shorter than you that makes you want to shank that person in the neck. Doesn't really help when a little girl suffering from acute ADHD describes one of your drawings, the product of what you spend the majority of your free time doing, as coming from "the land of ugly". And it crosses the line when she tries to serve me by drawing a shitty picture of a heart. Wei unofficially adopted her under the name of "that fucking trashylittlebaby". She had a pot belly. But at least she was bluntly honest,which I prefer over humoring or passive aggressive shadiness... It all starts going down hill when puberty starts...  Speaking of teenagers, and come to think of it, people in general... I think it's funny when people state their vastly superior intelligence over small children. Especially when people try to deny/justify/rationalize the one prevailing thought of everyone. When it comes down to it, people are equally, if not more impulsive as kids under the age of 6. They still have those thoughts/urges, it's just they also have self control. Teenagers reflect well the general populace: they more or less have the intelligence of adults but their raging hormones inhibit their judgment just enough for them act on their impulses. Everybody knows what teenagers do when you leave them alone together in a room.
