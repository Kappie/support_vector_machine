I was yawning thru out the whole day. *Yawnz* Anyway, I 4got to bring my thermometer today and had to pay a fine of $1. Money wasn't the bad thing, the lectures by teacher after teacher was. Well after tt was 2 periods of F I didnt understand a shitz tt the teachers were talkin about. All I got frm tt whole 2 periods was tt damn food experiment thing. I didnt even get the date! L0L!  After F was English, which was slack. We went thru the summary frm a compre passenge. Chemistry was also slack, we basically juz went thru 1 qn. Chinese was worse, I was staring blankly at the ceiling and the walls and anything tt I cld stared at.  After recess was Physics, SLACK! While I was waitin for the e maths teacher to arrive, I went to the sofa at the back of the cls to slack even more and fat pussy cat came tumbling over. He started pullin my ears and claimed tt I wrote nasty stuff bout' him in my blog. Since when did I ever do so? He's sucha gd liar man. L0L! The rest of the day was oso SLACK!  After sch, I went wif Mal for lunch at the hawker centre. Mr Chan came along after the while and started naggin tt we shldn't be late for focus blah blah blah. We told him we were going for F instead and he went on naggin. *Yawnz* When we got back to sch, we went to find the rest of the F ppl, but we couldn't. So, we decided to head back to cls for focus instead. In the end, Hongyue told us tt F would be after Focus. Yea yea, real shitz! Everything ended around 4:30pm. *Yawnz*  I went wif lil' pig and fat pussy cat to Clementi Interchange. On the bus to the interchange, fat pussy cat mentioned smt quite true "I seldom take bus wif u." Well, true cuz we live in 2 veri different areas. Tt's juz too bad, no wait, actually it's a gd thing for me! L0L! Haha, but he was rite bout' it and he still had the face to say! The reason is simple! It's cuz he doesn't spend quality time wif me! Fat Pussy Cat! Anyway, it was quite entertaining on the MRT wif lil' pig. He always has smt to say, so tt's a gd thing as I dislike startin a conversation. Therefore, hafing around is realli gd as he always start the conversation first. Hehe, tt's basically wad I like. He was askin me if I disliked this certain person, I said yes. Well, I told him not to tell any1 either, hopefully my secret is save. But he said tt he and fat pussy cat already knew it. This was how he said it "When we wif him, u always dun wanna mix wif us, like we got virus liddat." L0L! I told him tt there were still others I didnt quite like.  Well, I'm not a person who's hard to get along wif. I mean when I treat some1 in a certain way, there obviously a certain reason. When I ignore some1, means tt I dun feel comfortable talkin to tt person. When I simply keep quiet, means tt I'm either thinkin real hard or juz depressed. I dislike/hate ppl cuz of their character most of the time. I HATE ppl who 1.Disrespect others, 2.Are juz racist, 3.Backstabs others, 4.Gifs me a bad impression of them and 5.Shows me those kindda "guai lan" face  attitude. The 5th is the worst, tt pisses me of within a sec. I'll probably be like "Who da hell do ya think ya r!?" My relationship wif some1 at first cld be best frens, but after he gives me tt face or/ attitude, we'll be known as ENEMIES. The other 4 are oso wad I truly hate.  In cls, most ppl dun treat me well at all. Actually I can say every1 except most of the gers and not more than 3 guys. They juz dunnoe my limit, they dunnoe when to stop, they juz keep going on and on and on and on and on. *Yawnz* Pathetic Fools. Tt's wad those ppl actually are. Well, I'm exhausted rite now and I wanna haf an early nite. So I guess this is gdbye~! Cya~ =]
