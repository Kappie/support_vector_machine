My friend Kate and I do latin dance together (latin dancing guy, oh how very gay :p) it's very up close and personal and quite touchy-feely,what's cool is, she has a boyfriend and I feel nothing for her.   Today at lunchtime my friend Liz was talking about how she was so 'buff'. I quoted "No one likes buff chicks" She replied with "some people don't even like chicks"  I also got a GMail account today, if anyone wants one too post a comment with your current e-mail  ~Paul
