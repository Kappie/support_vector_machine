For anyone who wants to know i have not started my summer reading, i am assuming that if u r not a complete stranger that you could've guessed it, but oh well. G/T rules. Geeks rule. Ya, i'm bored, so i'm just talking. IM me please, but not from 8-10:30 or 12-3 on weekdays, cause we have band then. E-mail me or something, please, have not talked to a lot of peeps all summer. DW7777 is SN and  urlLink DW7777@aol.com  is E-mail, that's simple enough. Talk 2 y'all sometime
