I try my hardest to give that child some discipline, anyone in there right mind would see he gets his posterior kissed on a regular, guilty conscience's basis. Also that he, even for a 5 year old, is one of the most cocky, self righteous, obnoxious, temperamental drama queens walking around.   So the argument started with me doing what regular people do and show Harry up and tell him of in the  proper  way, and I get "disciplined" for it. They then come steaming up when I was first attempting to manuscript this blog, and of we went. Ones really brought from deep inside the closet were thrown in all directions, me with my mind games, them with there pitiful double act of "official ownership regulations Ltd" and it boiled down to both parties telling each other where the other could stick it, if they didn't like the opposing proposition. All got rather tense, violence planned, but, fortunately for my mental well being and my psychotic nature with that cliche hypocrite, it failed to materialize.  Anyway, I need some rest-bite from that tomfoolery, so I'll probably be of to see Shrek earlier than planned at Wimbledon with Ian. He really makes me put things into prospectus, well them anyway, and I need a good rat about things and he is the ultimate agony aunt. God bless his soul. xBuBzx
