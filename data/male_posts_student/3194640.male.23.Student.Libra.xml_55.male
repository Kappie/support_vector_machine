Luckily the phone is not yet a year old and is still under warranty. I hope I can somehow transfer my phone book to another phone (if I need one) because I don't want to have to start over.  I read the following in  urlLink Guster 's  urlLink Road Journal  and I thought it was hilarious. Right now they are on tour with  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  and  urlLink Ben Folds  (I will be seeing them minus  urlLink Rufus  plus  urlLink Gavin Degraw  in Kansas City next week).      Transcription of a conversation between Brian Rosenworcel and Rufus Wainwright backstage in Gilford NH on July 1st:     RW:  Did you see that there's a chiropractor here?  BR:  Yeah, I think I'll skip it. Did you set that up?  RW:  I don't think so. I think she's from the venue. Did you know chiropractics are illegal in France?   BR:  No .... what else is illegal in France?   RW:  I don't know. Murder?
