The rest of Australia gets up, takes a piss, says goodbye to their wives and travel to work, knowing that as long as someone else is the running of the country, they can still get shit faced at the end of the week.  The youth go to school, or smoke bongs, depending on Centerlink's unemployment benefits.  This seems to work, for the most part, but everyone knows at least a little bit about politics. Howard is Prime Minister, the Creen is the opposition leader. At least I think he is, it changes very often.  Bills are put forward, bills are rejected, bills are put forward again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Except when the following occurs.    Why the Australian Government is Stupid - Reason #1    Something funny happens. Someone crashed into a pair of buildings. Oops.  Johnny Howard is a bit worried. You see, he's in love with Bush. Bush puts out you see - god damn tiger in bed. Who can resist that accent? Anyway Bush wants little Johnny to come and help him.  'The peoples who attacks us, have big weapons, My Johnny - Will you pretty please come and kill them?' 'Sure thing maaaaate' 'You Aussies might die and shit' 'Whatever, I love you Bush, nothing can stand in the way of true love'  So people, despite the majority of the youth protesting in the city streets, watched as troops were sent out to do God knows what in the Middle East.  Why?  Because  they  had  weapons of mass destruction ! That's why. Now we can't bloody leave, it's not as if we can blow up shit and leave, you have to blow it up then walk around for a bit, you know, to make it official and whatnot.  Oh and how many W.O.M.D did we find again? Someone remind me, I forgot... (Zero isn't a hard number to remember... Oh right, irony, sorry- Dammo)    Why the Australian Government is Stupid - Reason #2    'We need more money John, whats a good way of doing that?'  "Heyyyy? Ah golly gosh, gee wizz poddle. Wait! I got it!"  'Whats that, Mr Prime Minister Sir?'  "Lets give universitites the ablitly to raise HECS fees for students by up to 30% to make up for the lack of government funding!"  'But Mr Howard Sir, won't that leave the poor people out?'  "No no no you fool, you see, we leave Nurse courses and shit out, cause we need more of them. That way, the rich kids will become docters, the poor ones nurses!"      'That's a bit biased. Won't that piss students off?'  "I'm used to that by now,  silly"     Why the Australian Government is Stupid -Reason #3     Medicare Telvision Ads  Sure they are funny when people take the piss out of them, but doesn't mean to put more of them on. It was estimated that Johnny spent 16 million dollers on advertising alone.  You know it makes sense. (And this is why Australia never moves forward, because of lazy bastards like Alec xD- Dammo)
