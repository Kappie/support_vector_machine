Anyway, she had to go to bed so I had to find something else to do because I couldn't sleep anymore, not that I'd want to, but I couldn't because the sun was up and in the room and everything and I just have a hard time sleeping with light, generally. So I decided I'd read the news, but got tired of it so I just walked around the house and eventually picked up the guitar and started playing. I also organized and packed up the house a bit more.  I had an appointment at 2:15 so at around 1:37 I left to catch the bus to Harvard square from where I would walk up Mass Ave to my orthodontist's office to do nothing less than take off my braces. "Hoorah!" I thought as I walked there, "I'm finally getting my braces off! It's all done. Go ME!" I arrive there like 5 or 10 minutes early but they take me and they do their whole thing, which was painless for the most part except for when they needed to pull the bands around the molars off because my teeth weren't cooperating with them and their tool wasn't cooperating with the band so it hurt a bit, but it wasn't too excruciating. After I got 'em off, they took impressions, my picture, and some x-rays, which all went smoothly.  I have to say though, I'm not sure that I don't prefer having braces. I never realized how big my teeth were until they took 'em off and I looked in the mirror and saw: BAM! BIG WHITE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT TEETH! and it was shocking because for two and a half years I saw metal brackets and arch-wire over these big white chompers. Anyway, I don't exactly feel comfortable smiling anymore and it bothers me, but I think I'll get used to it pretty quickly. I get used to everything pretty quickly. I remember when I first got my braces on, I had no inhibition about smiling with them. It's not that I was proud or anything of them, but I didn't see anything wrong or "ugly" about them. I thought they were kind of cool and added to my whole personality. I guess I, in a way, became the braces... or did the braces become me? I don't know, but the point is that I just... I just... I miss my braces! :'(  I'll have a picture of me without braces up as soon as I can take one, though.  Anyway, after I got 'em all off, I took the T over to my dad's work and showed him and he was all like "wow, great. that's great. I'm happy for you." and then I explained my predicament and he was like "pffft!!" so whatever. I went home after that and played the campaign from Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne because I only just got an illegal copy of it from Ali because I really don't like paying someone to waste my time. It's not a bad game, but it's not terribly great either, but I think I'll just go through it and beat it like everything else. While playing, I got a call from my dad inviting me to dinner with him and Erik. We went to Pinnochio's or however the fuck you spell it and ordered the same thing as ever, I got a cheesesteak thing, my dad and erik each got two slices of tomato basil pizza, Sicilian style or whatever they call it. It was, as always, good. We walked around Harvard Square... AGAIN, but this time got ice cream at Toscanini's. I hadn't had it in a really long time, but when I had it tonight, I was reminded why I love the place so much. The ice cream fucking rocks.  Then we came home and I wrote this post. On the way home though, before I end this thing, I heard this very "enriching" conversation between like 6 high school students. It was quite possibly the best show of intelligence that I've seen in a long time. I mean, these wise folk are our best and brightest.   This one is not --> I think that if and when the reinstate the draft, they shouldn't try and make the polling more even. They should pull the lazy moronic fucks like the ones I heard on the bus and make them get their acts together. I mean, if they can't think, at least give them a gun to kill people that my elected officials think are dangerous. God, just don't pollute the american air with your retarded scat about beating the shit outta some motherfucker who borrowed a box of fucking tic-tacs. America is doomed by it's political correctness. We need to stop being so politically correct and start saying things for what they are. Not all high school students are stupid, but the majority of the ones that I see don't have the mental capacity to think about a single issue more complex than whether or not to dump their current significant other or something ridiculous like that. And YET, "in an effort to make the army a more diverse pool" (or something along those lines) the US Govt. is actually gonna take people with a brain and hopes and dreams and opportunities and send them off? FUCK THAT! I'm dodging any fucking draft that comes my way because I know I'm better than some nameless soldier on the field, however heroic his actions may be. I'd much rather send the douche at the back of the bus because he probably isn't gonna be as much service to the US in the long run just talking and thinking about what he is now, so yeah. I think that just about sums it up. I'm sorry if I repeated anything, but I'm too tired/lazy to check and fix it.  That is all. -- Feanor
