I think Josh is leaving on Wednesday and Katie later this week, so it's a perfect time to have a party!  Katie is organizing a party at her and my (old) place... I'm not toally moved yet, so I'll be back up there as well (I might be late, but I'll be there!)  It's Tuesday evening, come whenever you can make it (early evening I'm guessing) until however late you can make it.  1152 W Newport Ave... and hopefully if the weather holds for us we'll have it in our front yard.  See you there!
