One reason for this is that the album emerged as the “old Beatles” (you know, the guys who dress alike and sing “yeah, yeah, yeah” songs) were being replaced by the “new Beatles” (the ones with longer hair who did drugs).  Revolver brought together the best of both worlds in a creative blend.  In my opinion, Revolver demonstrates how the Beatles could individually write great songs.  For example, George Harrison’s  Taxman  is a sarcastically humorous take on taxes (probably in light of how much of the Beatles income went to taxes).  Harrison also succeeded with  I Want to Tell You , an upbeat song that conveys the frustration of having something to say but having no way to spit it out.  Now, I should point out that George failed miserably with his song  Love You To .  In  Love to You  George didn’t realize that the sitar would never become an appealing instrument in popular Western culture.  I always skip this song.  It really hurts to listen to more than four seconds of it.  Incidentally, John Lennon hated this song so much, he refused to play for its recording.  John wrote some experimental songs on the album, such as  Tomorrow Never Knows , which reflects the later avant garde style he would try out with Yoko Ono.   Doctor Robert  is an ambiguous tune, which is arguably about a doctor who would prescribe certain clients happy medicine.  John wrote the trippy tune  She Said She Said  based on an LSD induced conversation.  Although John does return to traditional songwriting like the guitar duet  Your Bird Can Sing  and his song about sleep deprivation,  I’m Only Sleeping .  But the reason I truly love Revolver is for the songs Paul McCartney wrote.   Here, There, and Everywhere  could be Paul’s best written love song of his career.  In passing, I would like to note that I use this song as a test for love relationships.  I’ve always wanted to be with a girl to whom I could sincerely sing that song.  Paul explores themes of religion, death, and meaning in the symphonic  Eleanor Rigby .  Once again, another landmark in Paul’s songwriting career.  Paul brings a positive note into the album with  Good Day Sunshine , which can put anyone into a good mood just by hearing it.  Paul writes a bittersweet love ballad with  For No One , a song that is beautiful because I’ve never experienced it.  Finally, Paul wrote  Got to Get you Into my Life  as an ambiguous allusion to his experimentation with LSD.  Despite its subject matter, the song sports the Beatles attempt at Motown with its full brassy sound.  This is another one of those songs that can instantaneously put you in a good mood.  Revolver might be my favorite Beatles album.  It’s hard to pick one.  At any rate, its musical and lyrical content provides one with plenty to think about and enjoy.  I think I’m going to listen to it right now.
