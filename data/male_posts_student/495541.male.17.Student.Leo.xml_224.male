Celebration of the Chemistry unit we know as a MOLE.  I made a mole t-shirt for extra credit.  I couldn't have made my shirt any more plain.  It feels like the week should be over.  Tuesday felt more like Friday if you ask me.  Today is truly unique day because I don't have anything to do except my homework and open gym which I don't want to go to.  The reason why I don't plan on going is because I am exhausted.  Wednesday was probably the worst lifting/conditioning day ever.  Streched, did dots, lifted weights, did jumped rope for about 5 minutes, 100 sit-ups, 25 supermans, 25 finger-tip push-ups, did bouding on two feet for about 40 yards, then just right, then just left, ran a mile, did about six 30 yard sprints.  EVAN HECKERT YOU BETTER BE DOING A LOT OF STUFF AT ACCELERATION!  I'm not complaining, I'm just tired.  So that was Wednesday.
