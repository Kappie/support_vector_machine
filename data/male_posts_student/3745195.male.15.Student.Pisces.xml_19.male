Anyways, I got it out and started looking at it and then I decided that I was going to type up the third chapter caues I knew that wasn't on my computer yet, but then when I went to check I found out that my second chapter had been erased so now I have to type that up too. UGH. I also came to the conclusion that my second chapter is too long because in other books like the wedding [that's the one I'm holding so i used that as an example] page 65 is the fifth chapter, but in mine that's in the middle of chapter three. Page 65 and I'm still in the THIRD CHAPTER!!! I've done edits on it like 50 times I can't cut anything else out. Oh well I don't care if people don't like their second chapters about 30 pages long they can deal. Although more than likely I'll never finish it. I'm the worste writer in the world. I mean in quality I'm ok, but I just take so long to write. I started this book on May 8th 2001 and now it's July 16th 2004 and I'm still on the third Chapter. Jeesh. Well anyway I should go pack for my basketball camp so I'll talk to everyone soon I hope.Luv ya allBye
