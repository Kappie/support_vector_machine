(if you really want to know, you can ask)  Lighthouse:: My mommy, she loves Lighthouses  Sycamore:: Groove (Again, you can ask if you really want to know)  Inhumane:: Inhumanities  Sneer:: *Sneers*, what a stupid one  Weapon:: BAD!    Anyways, my days are going ok. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to homecoming with Dominique. I had a really good time, for the most part. Today was good too. Dominique said the sweetest thing to me, but I am not going to say what it is. This one is between her and me. Thanks for reading and now back to your regularly scheduled program.  That's it guys. You can go now. Anytime. *Whistles then checks watch*. I am not going until you guys do. Okay, this is the part where you move your mouse up to the little "X" in the upper right hand corner (for you Steve, I am not sure which corner it is in, but it is definitely just a box). Okay on the count of three...One...Two...Thr.....
