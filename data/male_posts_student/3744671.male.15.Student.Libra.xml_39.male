I've wanted one of these beautiful devices for quite some time now, but the price point is very steep!  Unfortunately I still don't have one yet, but my friend just bought one and I was looking at it, and got my first chance to try it out and put music on it. I must say, this is amazing! He has the 30 GB version, which is enourmous, you can cram tons and tons of tunes on there! If you're in the market for a new MP3 player, and can afford one of these dandies, buy it! I hope to get one soon enough. They're so handy too, you'll have all your music on this little device, no more lugging around your CD collection! And I have a HUGE CD collection, so when I'm traveling I can never bring it all, only a small portion of it. This way, you can put it all on your iPod. It's also big enough to pack around other types of files besides audio tracks.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
