My friend insists on feeling miserable and seeing the bad side of everything, and whenever she feels badly and I try to listen, she rubs it off on me. I'm  sorry  if I can't always be there for you, but we're just friends. Her definition of a friend extends up and beyond. She wants a  boyfriend  or some kind of higher-level commitment because that's what she's lacking right now. She misses her old boyfriend, and so there's this vaccuum there that she feels her friends need to fill. We just can't fill that position! The best we can do for her is to help her grow out of him and move on, but she doesn't want to move on. And people wonder why I don't like serious relationships. She told me that I was lecturing her, and I  was . I watch her torture herself, and her ex-boyfriend has probably never been driven to such extremes. It's really sad for me to see her bent out of shape over him, and I don't know what to do. I'm no expert on that subject. I recall many people earlier on in life asking me what to do about their friendships, and I could give them a little advice or help. However, I have VERY little experience in romance. My goodness how it boggles the mind. The best I can see it, is a chain reaction of brain-chemical stimulations. But what aroused this entry today (I was originally going to talk about fortune cookies) was the fact that she wanted to go out. _You know, I like spending time with her, but I have to get ready before I go out. I got   out of bed at like 3:30 PM, and suddenly she wants to go out. Normally, if my parents are conscious, I'll just ask them, and maybe they'll take me, maybe not. She just cannot accept an answer of "no." So she insists that I go with her, and gets one of her parents to drive me, which I am hesitant to accept for my own personal reasons (think Cunninghams vs. Ewells + appearance-obsessed parental units = me rocking back and forth in corner). However, there arise complications brought on by the extremity of the spontaneity. Of course, the night before I told her to be more capricious. Whenever I try to help her, it seems, my advice always backfires, even like studying for tests, and it makes me feel bad and not want to help her, ESPECIALLY when she gets angry with me and I can't do anything except to hope for forgiveness. I wish she would just accept my amphetamine-like properties ("uppers") as they are and nothing else. Sometimes, when she gets this agitated by such a small matter, it makes me angry, knowing that there are so many wrong things going on in the world. It's not as if either I or she can do anything about it, but there is more sour milk to be fretting about. (For those of you who read my "reserving my right to be angry," this is different somehow). I don't know why I'm trying to persuade you. You don't even know me. I guess I'm trying to defend myself. Oh well, I give up. _I had always imagined summer as a time to relax, because school was over and so there should be nothing to get in the way. And for the past few summers that has held true, but this summer, oh boy, I can't seem to go a week without something bothering me internally. wha-? sorry I got distracted by this article. I guess I'll talk about fortune cookies now... _So I was cleaning my room, and stumbled upon my old jar of fortune cookie fortunes. -_-.... I have the worst luck with those things. Honest-to-goodness, one of them said, "Listen to a good song everyday." WHAT KIND OF FORTUNE IS THAT? I'll tell you:  it isn't ! It's an advisory statement! I guess that's the backup plan for fortunes when nothing happens in your life. They just tell you what you should do so that maybe you'll actually get a fortune (XP). Now, whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant, I dread the advent of the bill. Those smug little cookies, smiling at me with their crescent shape, taunting me to open it up. I don't even really like them, they're so bland. hey! I am  not  going to let my life be ruled by a cookie, I'll tell you that much! What ever gave little baked morsels the right to command their makers about? Even when I do get the occasional fortune fortune, it'll just be mocking me by dangling words about "romance" or "marriage." Yes, I truly believe there is this old prognosticator with a cutthroat sense of humor writing these for me. Or you know, they could also be randomly generated by computers. But what are the odds? That  every  time I get one of those cookies they order me around? I thought about writing a comic pertaining to them, just to spite it, but... just like "Suburbania," I never got around to it, or it just, slipped through my fingers. *Goes up and edits title*... What else? oh, that's all? okay, well, before I go, I think I should start making my own fortune cookies, except they would be more specific and bitingly sarcastic. Like "Your significant other is cheating on you with the secretary one floor below, because you're right, 'it  is  you...' Oh! and also you will also find ten pennies on the ground face-up this week! :-)"
