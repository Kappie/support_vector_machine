What are you good for? And we laid in my bed like a train wreck And we both got laid like concrete And we fought like soldiers But we died.. we died like flies Day or night Fuck if I know Hard to tell with no fucking window And sundials What good are sundials once the sun is gone? What are you good for?  Alkaline Trio- Sundials
