I got my hair cut, Brian style, right to the skull... well, maybe I exaggerate, I haven't seen it since I got out of the barber shop. Here's my philosophy with hair:  1) It's just hair. 2) It grows back. 3) It's a pain to go to the barbershop, therefore going to the barbershop is best reserved for a monthly or month and a halfly activity.  Yup... the last time I got my hair cut was last month, almost to the day. I was just starting strength and conditioning camp, and I would have died running from excessive head heat.  The barber was a pretty funny guy... an extremely talkative HUGE black guy, about 21 years old. I had to stop myself from laughing, because I had just watched Scary Movie 1... which featured the huge gay black man. And this guy? Uh huh. But very nice, even though he thought I was cute... which I just might be! Hee hee!
