As many of you have probly noticed I've been growing out my Italian Facial Hair for about 2 and a half weeks (shaved last on Fri May 21), well I didn't shave it off, but I did clean it up... I am not quite the bum I was...  Speeking of hair... Do you think I should grow it out on top again? Either like earlier this year or like in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Picture below...  Well as Johnny B says "The opposite of Annyong"  -Dan V
