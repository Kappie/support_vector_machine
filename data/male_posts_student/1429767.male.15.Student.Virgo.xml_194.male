Today this guy, I'm not exactly sure of his name though, instant messaged me saying that he reads my blog and all so that's cool. He pretty much knew everything about me, there is some stuff though that I don't dare put on here so he doesn't know everything and my friends don't either... Well anyway the good but weird in a way thing about having a public blog like this is that anyone could stumble upon it and read all about your life. This isn't always a bad thing, but it can be odd at times, like when this guy talked to me tonight I felt odd that he knew everything about me and I knew well, close to nothing about him. So I guess you could look at it as a way to meet people and such or to see how others feel about things or whatever else you wanna know... OK that thought is dead now, I thought it was going to be something good to write about but it's not anymore so skip it! Well today nothing much happened, all I really did was steal some more of Josh's DSL, as is to be expected, and then went to the VanBuren County fair with Josh's family. The fair was pretty good I suppose, we didn't get to do much because by the time we took Kaitlyn around the Kiddy rides the storms started rolling in and they had to shut down all the good rides so we just ate and left for home... The storms I guess were really bad around Niles and Edwardsburg a Tornado was reported on US12 but whatever it doesn't matter to me.... The sirens kept going off here in Dowagiac for no reason it seemed to me. Well I don't really feel like talking abotu anything else so I'm done rambling now!
