In addition to that, I try to keep myself busy by grabbing trays, helping run, and doing whatever else I can just so long as there's a lull or there's nothing to do except wait for stuff.  Weirdest thing I heard was that nuts and bananas make Rob's (my afore mentioned supervisor) ears itch.  Working hard gets tiring so I decided to take today off to rest and perhaps get my and my neighbor's grass cut.  I won't be able to cut the yard becuase it rained very hard last night.  I figured I'd still be able to meet Ashley (I had planned with her the night before to do so) except I wouldn't be in work clothes.  Much to my anger/disappointment/sorrow, I couldn't meet her because my dad sprung some project up on me.  Now Ashley has to be disappointed because she traveled half an hour to get there and only got breakfast (we were supposed to meet outside McDonald's).  I talked to my Mom about it last night, but she seems to think I was being sneaky about it.  I guess she didn't understand that I was going to meet her up there because when I asked her if I could ride my bike up there, she acted like, why didn't you tell me you were going to meet some girl.  I don't think meeting her was an issue, but I guess I have to make things painfully obvious in the future.  I am extremely disappointed and angry though that I didn't get to go up there.  I had planned this out and it fell through because of some mystery pop up project that had to be done right then my dad gave to me.  Because of that stupid surprise, I missed my one opportunity to meet her, and a bunch of people (mostly her) prolly think I'm the biggest jerk because I wasn't there.  I can't apologize enough for not being there, even though I don't think apologizing did any good whatsoever.  If there's any way I can make it up to you, Ashley, let me know.  I'll prolly post a little later on some other stuff, but I didn't want to forget what I already was gonna post like I did about what my work days were like.  Signing out with the utmost disappointment, Joshua Robert Guynn
