Digging my nails under the tab and pulling it up resulted in the normal, satisfying sound.  However, there was nothing normal about  this  can of soda. Completely unaware of the horrors about to befall me, i put it up to my lips and began to suck down the liquid. What passed over my tongue I can honestly say was the worst-tasting thing i have ever consumed. Ever. I promptly spewed it all over the room, almost vomiting, and rushed to the sink to attempt to wash the taste off, but it only made it stronger. It went down my throat like sewer slime and sat in my stomach like a lead weight. After I recovered, thoughts went through my head: Who would make such a horrible, horrible ooze and market it as an drinkable product? What the hell was it? I picked up the half-empty can and read the label: "Cel-Ray Celery Soda."  I read it again. Celery. Soda.  Celery.  For god's sake, look, and i mean really  look  at what you're getting the next time you reach in the fridge.  Oh, and apparently Anna is God's gift to men. And available. And holding a gun to my head.   Celery. What the fuck.   End Transmission.
