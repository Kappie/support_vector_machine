ESPN is calling it Separation Saturday, because the great teams will separate themselves from the good.   The afternoon begins with No. 2 Miami at No. 5 Florida State. Continues with No. 1 Oklahoma playing archrival No. 11 Texas. Those games make up a doubleheader on ABC Sports. The night features No. 3 Ohio State at No. 22 Wisconsin, and No. 10 Georgia at No. 14 Tennessee, which will determine the leader in the SEC East. In the SEC West, the winner of Auburn at No. 8 Arkansas will join No 6 LSU at the top of the division. __________________________________________________________   Saturday, October 11   MIAMI AT FLORIDA STATE    No. 2 Miami (5-0)   AT No. 5 Florida State (5-0)    Time: 12:00 PM ET  Tallahassee Forecast: Thunderstorms 65-80Â°F   _______________________________________  Is this heaven?
