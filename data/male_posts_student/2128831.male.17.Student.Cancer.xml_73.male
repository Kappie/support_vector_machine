So, I wasted 65 pages and then of course there is an error on all but one of them so 65-13 is 52.  52 more pages, so I am at 115 and then the permission slip and the initial entry of 5 and 4 more, we are at 124 pages, and I am not going because Mr. Gast the advisor is sick, and I have none of my books… and I am still here in school…  See if you say I am not dedicated well then bite me. Grarrg, it is okay… I will live it out, know?  But still that is a lot of paper and then the ink!  And also the toner! So much waste in this world!  Grrarg!  [5 minutes on life] Life is a random series of moments in time, insignificant to most everything else in life, important to you though. If I never had existed no one would have missed me, no one would have ever known that I was to exist.  Life should be lived, not worried about. Celebrate life, live life, don't regret life. Rejoice this is your turn.  Walk out on stage with you head held high and your smile on.  Shine all that you can.  This is your life.  You are the star of this show.  Live and learn as they say, but remember, "live" is first. People should get out and experience the wonders of life. Don't get bogged down in the little things of life, if you have a bad day, then go to sleep and wake up to a new one, and make it the best day of your life.  If life is in a rut, then get out, if you’re driving down a road and get trapped in a rut, you don't follow it, you slow down, and pull out. You must do the same in life, if you find yourself stuck, slowdown, think, and get out as soon as you can. One day you won't wake up, don't worry about it, you can't miss the things. You haven't done once you left this world.  Remember, it’s your life, live it how you wish. You have to stay in control. If you choose to give up that control, make sure it’s to someone you trust. -------------Fate will prevail always, things that happen in life happen for the better weather or not it seems like it at first, but down the road you realize it was for the better.  [5 Minutes on Trusting Your Gut]  Sometimes, not often, but sometimes your guts can make up your mind for you. Sometimes when you see, or hear, or smell, or sometimes even think about something you will get what can only be described as a gut reaction. I only get these reactions during one of two events. The first is when I know I am in trouble. I mean real trouble. When I was a kid it was when I realized that whatever I just did I am going to get caught and punished. Be it breaking a lamp or getting a shitty report card. The instant that I comprehended exactly what the ramifications for my errant actions were going to be something happened to my guts. Like a little tiny black hole opened in my abdomen and a sucking vortex of guilt and dread were tugging on the mile and a half of my lower GI. It's not a good feeling. Now, the other time I feel something from belly is when, and this is going to come out so fucking gay, I am thinking about a guy I know I like. This does not happen when I see hot girls this only happens when I think about a boy that I really, really, like even if right up until that point I didn't even know it. I'll just be thinking about him and all the sudden my shit tubes will jump a little bit. It's like a girlish little glee-hiccup. This internal guffaw is both unsettling and wonderfully uplifting at the same time. When it happens to me in this capacity, that is to say when my very biology is telling me that this boi is something special, I consider the best advise I could get. For the record, this is not some notion I am putting to paper (or its equivalent) for the fuck of it. I am obviously pining like a little loser over someone in particular so I'll just put it out there. Unbelievably it's Riley Paul-Patrick Hays, he still makes my insides churn every time I fucking speak to him. Now that's saying something.   NOT RELAVENT TO ABOVE I put my trust in you  and you betrayed me  Took what I gave you  and fucking raped me  But you can't kill me...  It's not that easy  I'm still standing  Still breathing!  Spitfire  Spite hate Spit all the shit you talk  Right back in your face  I spit liars  I spit names  I spit truth  And my song remains the same!  I gave you faith  When none believed you  Barely escaped....  But who decieved who?  You tried to guilt me  with things you'd tell me...  You didn't build me  You can't sell me  Fuck your label!
