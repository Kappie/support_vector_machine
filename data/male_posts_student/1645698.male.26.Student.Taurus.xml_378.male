But the hrs after regents were awesome. We all hung out in the park n' shit. Nice to all of us hang out as friends, 'cause we don't enough, and we haven't really yet.   Oh and besides that.......HOLY CRAP, YAHOO just got so much fuckin' better. They've increased the limit for attachments from 1 mb, to TEN FRIGGIN' MB. As a long time Y! mail user, this is significan't. Furthermore, and the best shit yet...its not your regular 3mb mail limit...it isn't you 6mb, like they had...not ONLY does junk mail not count to that limit...but its also...a 100mb mail limit! Now that's just awesome.  Besides that, Imma save the sappyness for a post after we'll all haveta part ways, but seems half the circle's gonna know eachother better for a fine time longer.  Welp, until I find more stuff to write about...  This is the Zenman...ohhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmm....uh...more bhuddist gibberish....  "So I took out this big-ass knife, right? But THEN, it turned out the giant lobster I was fighting, WASN'T a giant lobster! It was Elizabeth Taylor! And that big-ass knife I pulled out, wasn't a big knife I pulled out! It was a big-ass sardine I pulled out! Needless to say, I gave that bitch one helluva fish-smack! THWACK! Fish guts EVERYWHERE."
