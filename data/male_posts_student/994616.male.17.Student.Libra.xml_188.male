I really love drema like that, where you get to meet someone that you've had a crush on and they meet and exceed all of your expectations, because everything is perfect in your dreams. The dream basically consiisted of me coming home (to a really awesome home) and seeing Colin there. We talked for a while - I have no idea what about. Then we both had to get ready to go out (to seperate places). And we left, I think ym dream continued for a while longer, but I'm not sure.   Now like i said I love the dreams, I don't love the effects my dreams about Colin (we're on a first name basis :P ) has on me. The first one is that my near obsession of Colin is rekindled for the next few days / weeks. And it's even worse because I get the crazy fleeting thoughts like "what if he's having the same dreams as me - then whe he actually meets me we'll fall in love bla bla bla"    The second effect is that is rekindles my need to be a movie star, model or some other famous person. This one sucks just as hard becaust it makes me semi-depressed. I feel like my life is going to be less worthwhile because no one will know my name. I'll just be this little anonymous guy that convinces you to try the new brand of window cleaner.
