We were a GOLD band, and this SYF they got a SILVER. What the hell happened!? But all in all, it was a joyful occasion. The conductor changed however, and according to my juniors, he bullshits a lot. I am loath to assign the ineptitude of the band to either the juniors or the conductor, however.                   Major happening today. I thought about the AGP cards I am gonna get. At first I settled on the nVidia GeForce FX 5950 Ultra which, by far is the card with the best refresh rate. It also seems to me that it’s very ex, that’s y I wanna get it. Then upon further research, the ATI Radeon 9800 XT seems like a better choice. It gives better image quality and better overclocking speeds. It’s main software accelerator is Direct X 9+ orientated, which is the model of future games, I believe. Whereas the nVidia GeForce FX 5950 Ultra is more OpenGL orientated. Not a major accelerator in the future, no. So the card is settled, now the time. I had thought I should get the card sometime soon, especially since I wanna try it with Doom 3 which, btw, releases 2 days from today. Which implies I have to get the AGP card soon, like during this weekend. Highly improbable, since I lack the resource and the appropriate amount of knowledge to soundly base my judgement on. Unfortunately, this means the buying time is gonna wait, which is probably a good thing, at least I can get my hyperthreading cpu and the graphics card together. Don’t ask me, I didn’t know why I’m such a hardcore gamer, but…….doesn’t having power of computing and performance gets you excited? It does for me, definitely.    See myself walking in the footsteps of Evan, who literally counts down till his AGP card arrives (his card is a ATI Radeon 9600 XT, previous model to the ATI Radeon 9800 XT). Tell me to get a life and I’ll tell you that your life sucks without a com. I’m a geek, and I don’t see any wrong in that. So, cheers! Evan.                   It seems that I should get the best configuration right now, ATI will develop a new graphics core in about 2 years. The products would boost slightly more performance power than the present one, so I needn’t upgrade when ATI launches the next graphics core. As for the processing unit, the norm will stay at about 2-3GHz after 3-4 years, which would give me a pretty reasonable processing power. In another 2-3 years, Microsoft will launch a new OS called the Longhorn ( urlLink http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/ ). Upon the release of this better OS, there graphics industry and processing power would be revolutionized. Thus, a need for newer and better next-generation graphics card is justified. Thus meaning the next time I would upgrade is about then. And thus, it would be 5 years for me to get a new comp. This means that if I were to upgrade now, this would be the most sensible and comfortable time. End of the year I think. Heck, maybe I don’t even need to buy the AGP, I might just get it in Christmas! (I have been dropping hints to appropriate party concerned)                   Anybody who finds fault in my reasoning, please tell me. I wouldn’t be wanting to make wrong judgement. Thanx.                   Doom 3. It’s a game that will send a shiver down your back. The gameplay is freakish and, pls don’t play at night. The demo is already too creepy, but I like to be spooked, so I’m getting the game. By all accounts, Doom 3 is very hot. It would be sold out at the end of the first week of release. What the heck! Let them get first, I’ll get it like after the As.
