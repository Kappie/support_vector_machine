You are brave souls, traversing deep seas of blog bullcrap to get to this special blog bullcrap. Bless you.   Before I get to my main point, I want to wish my congratulations to the newly married couple whose wedding I attended last weekend. It was a beautiful ceremony made better by the fact that it was overwith in 20 minutes. There was an open bar at the wedding, and the bride's dad was walking around with pitchers of MGD. Classy. My only complaint was that the purple-hi-i'm-21 wristband left some goo on the cuff my my shirt that isn't coming off. It's the price you pay for free booze. There is always a hitch.   I just got done watching the movie "Kids." For those of you that have seen it, ask yourselves, "What makes me want to keep watching that movie?" For those of you who answered the previous question with anything perverted, you're a horrible person and you are going to burn in hell. For those of you that haven't seen it, one in every four-five hipster movie buffs own it, so take it from them andwatch it. Forewarning: It is not for the faint of heart, or easily put off by graphic anything. And if you can't listen to swearing, you won't make it more than a few seconds into the movie.   It is a morosely disturbing tale of teenage love, sex, drugs, and AIDS. I'm pretty sure it was made by a dirty old man, but regardless, it is one of the most explicit movies that is available for viewing in the US that you can't find at Captain Pete's $8.99 Porno Shack. It's also one of the more heartbreaking movies I own, and not to ruin the ending, but it also serves as a backwards type of anti-teen sex morality tale. It also stars the suberb and underused Chloe Sevigny. If you only watch mainstream stuff, chances are the only time you've seen her was in the supporting role to Hilary Swank in the gender-confusion dramography Boys Don't Cry.   I recommend "Kids" for anyone, but especially mature kids in the 14-18 age range, especially those becoming sexually active. If this doesn't scare you, nothing will.   Now that this PSA is overwith...
