I can always hope that the people who haven't died yet, would come back from the war, alive.  And I can always hope that future leaders of such compassion for America, will remain well.  But then the heroes would be forgotten; forgotten in the midst of hope for future persons, and not remembered as the past heads further and further away.         urlLink 60th Anniversary of D-Day     urlLink Another 5 Die     urlLink Remember Reagan        60TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY    Today is the 60th anniversay of D-Day.  On June 6, 1944, Operation Overlord commenced with a landing of over 5,000 ships, 11,000 airplanes, and 150,000 service men. 1   After suffering hell on the beaches, more than 4,000 Allied Forces were dead.  But after the shock had hit the troops of the blood massacre and death, "Fortress Europe had been breached."  2     Operation Overlord was a mission against Nazi Germany.  It was a mission for freedom against Adolf Hitler.  Against a tyrant who loved his people, and put his morals on the line for them.    Adolf Hitler killed off more than 1,000,000 million Jews.  America saw that as wrong, and the soldiers acted upon it.  They fought not only for America, but for people half way around the world.  There's something extraordinary about these men, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but the word comes close to 'miracle.'    ANOTHER 5 DIE    Five U.S. soldiers were killed  when their vehicle was attacked near Sadr City. 3   I don't know why the news sources, including the LA Times, didn't show the names of the people who died.  It's the least they could do, seriously.    The total death toll is about over 600, with the death of the five soldiers. 4   Why?  Why did they put their lives at risk?  Why?  I can't imagine the amount of bravery, patriotism, and self-neglect even if you told me.        REMEMBER REAGAN     Our 40th president, one that has attracted great amounts of popularity, has died.  June 5, 2004 is his passing date, and shall his memory never be forgotten.   It was Alzheimer's that took his life.  It first starts off with memory loss.  Then it gets worse by progressing to a more higher stage of memory loss; forgetting common words and phrases, and objects, and names.  Then, the concentration of the person is affected.  It becomes increasingly difficult to pay attention.  All the while, the memory keeps getting worse until he or she has lost the ability to respond with the environment.   5     That is what happened to Mr. Reagan.  By the time he died, he didn't know of his immense contributions towards pushing America to where it is now.  He is credited with ending the Cold War, which stopped communism from spreading.  And:    "In 1986 Reagan obtained an overhaul of the income tax code, which eliminated many deductions and exempted millions of people with low incomes. At the end of his administration, the Nation was enjoying its longest recorded period of peacetime prosperity without recession or depression."   6     There were alot of other things he did.  But that is sort of out of place here.  I think the main point is to remember him, period.  He is one of the few presidents I admire most.  His speeches were not of this world; there was an audio recording on KFI the other day, and it was absolutely amazing.  Here is an excerpt from Ronald Reagan's speech on commemorating D-Day:    "Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet, you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief. It was loyalty and love."   I will always remember yesterday, as the day America lost a little bit of it's soul; the soul Reagan worked so hard to make truly great for us.
