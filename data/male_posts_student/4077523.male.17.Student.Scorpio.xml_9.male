I went to an Ice Cream Party for the seniors today, it was fun but not really alot to do. When it was over the ones that bought a parking space left to paint it. It's hard to believe it's my last year. I'm still trying to decide if I want to buy a senior jersey, I might but i'm not sure. I have until thursday to decide.      Last night Jarrod and I didn't go to Sonny's but we went to Wendy's instead because we couldn't get a group to go. Well, i'm gonna go because I wanna get school over and make it to Thursday and Friday. Peace!
