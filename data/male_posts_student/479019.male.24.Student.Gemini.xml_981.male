The best book was on intellectual property law and how while authors won some rights, the artist / performer gets cut out of the scheme. I need to think about this some more and re-read Walter Benjamin and Bernard Edelman. Refreshing myself on Marx and labor power might be useful too.  The library was fucking freezing so I went to where I was planning on meeting Esther for dinner early. West Hollywood... such an interesting place. I went to go kill time by going into a bookstore I saw down the street. I was walking around looking for the non-fiction section, but then I realized that all they had was gay erotica and porn.   Dinner was cool, and then we hung out at Esther's place and had her homemade Young's Double Stout ice cream. Good stuff. It'd been a while since Esther and I really got a chance to hang out, so it was especially cool.   Oh and somehow she has the highest score on my Albert Quiz, with 90. What the hell is wrong with all you other friends that got shitty scores!!! Just kidding.  ***
