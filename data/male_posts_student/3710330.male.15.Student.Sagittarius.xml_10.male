Today is the Year A.D. 2004 and the second day of June; The fifteenth day of the 5th month and the Year 93, in the Chinese Calendar. Today is definitely inauspicious.  Let's say, if there was these two groups of wearily-looking,but with a distinctive look of nervousness, students sitting down in the spacious school hall, awaiting two pairs of menacing and evil-looking teachers at the other end of the hall, of whom are armed with a red  pen and a scoresheet, having contemptuous looks on their faces of the largly English educated students.And coupled over with students constantly pulling at their necks and draining their sweat, flipping their books desperately attempting to memorise words and simultaneously opening and closing their mouth, as though they were gawking at a group of beautiful girls but without that look of obscenity. What does that make up? -The Unversity of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Singapore, General Certificate of Education Ordinary level, Chinese Examinations for Oral.(if you say this fast enough,Im sure the teacher will admit you into the International Tongue Twisters Competition)  Doesnt it stun you? The very premonition of anything related to Chinese is enough to strike me dead on the floor.  Well...so...ermm...with great trepidation, I sat down with all the other worried looking souls in the Examination(school) hall. Mr Chew, the official CLESICTMOESGCOEOCEO(If you would scroll up,this acroymn means the Chinese Orals,pretty long eh?). I scanned the four examiners, and discovered to my dismay that I was having an old hag and a balding man(hopefully the markers wont see this). The other side wasnt having much luck either, no Ms Cheryl Wong look alike, but a middle aged woman who seemed to have the inability to control herself laughing at the air molecules floating past her, and a woman with silverly long hair(NO, not albinism, but more of old age).  While sitting in nervousness, I kept saying to myself to be calm and confident but I seemed to get nervous, and the nervousness seemed to be getting to myself, making my self even more nervous and nervous, and even the nervousness was worsening my nervousness which was worsening my nervousness.Nevermind...just meditate and stop being nervous,but I seem to be getting too nervous, and the nervousness seems to be getting to me, Im going bonkers with nervousness oh dear my, I thinking Im getting nervous.  And then Mr. Chew called and interrupted my meditation. I trudged off to Mr. Chew's counter and saw the attendance list where he had been disputing over what the A and P stood for, mixing up apples with durians and pears with oranges and stuff...but he got it right when I reached the desk and proudly proclaimed to us of his breakthrough in discovering the actual words: Absent and Present.(Wowwww!!!)  At his desk, the stopwatch was rolling, condensation was forming on the bottle of green tea he had, the attendance sheet seemed to be a swirling cloud of mist in front of me, causing me to start drifting...  Startled out of my reverie, Mr Chew asked us whether there was anything troubling us that we would like to voice, and instinctively I mentioned the topic of nervousness. And all he told me was breathe deeply and drink water. But my legs seemed to feel to weak to walk just a few metres and I continued slouching in the chair awaiting for my turn, and started breathing deeply.  And five minutes was up and I stood up from the baked hot chair and walked(a good impression is mandatory) to the desk with a paper filed into a  plastic file. I started reading and attempted at untwisting words which were huddled in a tangled mess. I added emotions to the essay and with a tinge of excitement.  Time seemed to fly when I was reading. It had happened so soon, so quickly. I sauntered to the hot spot(Like I said, Social decorum is of paramount importance in terms of impression) while preparing  in my heart for a threshold of my life.   But sadly, nervousness got the better of me  SUMMARY OF MISTAKES DURING THE START OF ORALS   Error #1: the first wrong thing I did was to greet the teacher in the wrong time of the day.  Error #2: Being blur when the teacher expects to end the oral faster, wasnt a very good thing to do, especially in terms of handling with your Nric card...  I read with emotions and feelings and somehow near the end of the essay, I nearly fell into tears...(passage wasnt emotional, I just made it sound all sad,went overboard I guess) The second and third part, should I say disastrously, apolcalyptically, catastrophically(wish I had a Thesarus), terrible. Blabbering, stammering and stuttering (ugh...maybe I need two thesarus')was my niche and I kept using trite cliches, ultimately confusing the marker.  *Sigh*... not too good but at least over, hopefully I wont have to  do this again. (P.S. I hope that you readers note that my title has been exaggerated to show how drastic the Orals was, and take it lightly and not mistake it for I am well and alive.)
