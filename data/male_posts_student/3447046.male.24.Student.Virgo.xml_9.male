I've put hundreds of applications in, ranging from IT jobs to crap retail jobs.  I got hired at Starbucks.  It sucks but its enough for my bills while I'm going to school.  I've never worked retail before.  This will hopefully just be a temporary thing.  I've got another job I want to get, but am just waiting for it to open up.    I slipped and fell on my ass today at work.  Hurt my ego more than anything.  So now my back hurts (more than it did earlier today).  I've already got chronic back pain...and a bad knee...and nerve damage in both arms.  I'm falling apart.  Oh well...  I'll bitch about something else later...
