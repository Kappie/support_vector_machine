I love the intellectual challenge, the order that the law can potentially bring to things, and the opportunity it can give.  At the same time, law school seems very dark.  Most people are pessimistic and distrusting concerning human nature.  Sometimes, the nature of the very inquiries we are being trained to make assumes that people are inherently bad, and  that when someone acts in an honorable and noble way, that it is the exception.  Maybe this is true of all of society, but I know that the concept is overwhelmingly prevalent at law school.  Anyway, I am not sure where I am going with this, it just something that has occupied some of my thinking lately.  In addition, with Jackie graduating from SJC, she is now 2 to 2 1/2 hours away...and with her working two jobs, me in classes, gas prices being what they are, just seems like a recipe for a very stressful summer.  The worse is that the future is so open ended with her job...depending on if and where she finds a teaching job, the next year before our marriage could end being very trying...trying not on the relationship, just on each of us individually.  When she comes to visit, I am able to deal with the stress of classes better, I laugh more, I live more, and in general and a much happier person.  Being here by myself leaves me alone with my thoughts too much, and I don't like where my mind goes sometimes.  Overall, depressing thoughts have started to creep back into my life, and I hate that they have, especially when I know that there is so much good present in my life.  Seems like things pile on... the uncertainty concerning the next year and beyond, the dissatisfaction with the atmosphere of law school, the living alone, hardly seeing Jackie or my other friends, and questioning what I should be doing with my life...  Part of my overall frustration with things I know is traceable to the fact that I don't have a job this summer and I'm stuck taking summer classes.  I know that the classes are better than doing nothing and working a typical summer job, but oddly enough, I miss working...I miss the feeling of doing something productive and seeing the results of it, a weird advantage to those summer jobs.  My life has turned into a routine of books...which wouldn't be all that bad if I were choosing the books, and maybe doing some writing, instead of reading law case books and just having to attempt to hold onto all the information...  At this point, I just hit on something..."maybe doing some writing."  I have always held that in the back of my mind, that I would love to write.  Problems are that I do not possess good technical writing skills, and I can never decide on a direction, so anything I start to write seems to be completely sporadic, much like this and other journal entries.  Sometimes I think that writing might be a solution for me, something that would give more purpose than just the law school, but something the law school could help me with.  Still, it always comes back to the issue of what would I write about, what topic or group of topics would interest me sufficiently to put the time and effort into writing something substantial.  I think about writing about some philosophical ideas, but I am to indecisive about those topics, and not sure if I can really discuss them at a great depth.  I then think about writing about religion, and specifically my experiences with it and how I came to discover God again, and the general relations between the religions that I see, but who is interested in what I think...in reality, the only aspect concerning religion that I feel a lot of passion about is how people tend to compartmentalize their life, and leave religion, God, and so forth out of their day to day routines...but I don't think I could write for very long on that, which would then turn into an essay and nothing substantive, and I'v written essays, I have this desire to write something more substantial, something that is thoroughly in depth on a subject...and then I wonder if I have the patience to actually write something that is substantial and thorough.  Oh well, I guess I have exhuasted some of my thoughts for now...I will leave myself with a message from the Dalai Lama, words of wisdom...  "It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow.  All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties,  This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can me the problem seem very intense.  When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help - realizing, for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences.  This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in certain illnesses or when in pain.  At the time the pain arises it is of course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices to calm the mind.  But if you can make comparisons, view your situation from a different perspective, somehow something happens.  If you only look at that one event, then it appears bigger and bigger.  If you focus too closely, too intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable.  But if you compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming."
