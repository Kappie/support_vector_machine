It's an interesting thing. I've never managed to get straight A's until grad school. I had pretty crappy grades in elementary school. I had a 3.69 in high school, but that was a result of the AP class GPA bonus. I was mostly a B+ student in high school. As an undergrad I finished with a 3.405 GPA. There were a few quarters where I managed to get straight A-'s. So anyway, this semester I managed to get straight A's for the first time ever.   I simply just never really cared about grades or working hard. Then again working hard and effor is all relative to how much you enjoy what you're doing.   Oh yea I had an interesting conversation with  urlLink Esther  the other day... it went something like...  Me: I wasn't about to go asking all the Asian women if they knew an Esther. Or wait they probably do, there are a lot of Asian Esthers. Esther: Yea but all of them are 'azn' or Christian. Me: There was another Albert Fu at UCI that's the exact opposite of me... super Christian Me: These people besmirch our names. Speaking of Alex and Esther, it strikes me that they along with many of my good friends do artsy stuff. Those two along with  urlLink Andy ,  urlLink Cissa , Brandon, and others are all doing cool stuff. It makes me think I should get back into doing artsy stuff.  I'm going to UCI again this afternoon to see Minh-An's UROP presentation. I'm proud of her. I've known her for a few years now, despite us not hanging out much. She's an ambitious one.  ****
