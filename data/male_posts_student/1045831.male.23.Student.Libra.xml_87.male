Basicaly just have the time to sit back and live my life without much stress...  Yet I am somehow still unhappy..  My computer's soundboard is messed up so I get no sound out of it..  THis keeps me seperated from Willie, Pat, Hank and all my other boys that help me feel good at times when I start to kinda drop a little..  Ohh well life goes on.. I have found a new obsession..  The Sopranos..  I have watched like 15 episodes in a day.. thats almost 15 hours of Sopranos in a day with out missing any of my 4 classes (one that was 3 hours long)..  I must not have slept at all..  Women piss me off too..  I keep dwelling on all the lies told to me throughout my life by women..  God damn..  NO one can lie quite like a girl.. they have a style and I have a weakness that makes me trust them more than anyone else..  Fucking shit..  This is what gets me pissed but ohh well  I should have known what I was geting into when I started hanging out with any of these girls..  What I need more than anything is night spent with willie, hank, pat, jerry jeff and the rest of my buddies and a nice bottle..  doesn't look like I'm going to be able to get that anytime soon though..  I need to start working out.. burn off some of my anger and start feeling good..  If only it wasn't so god damn cold and icy out maybe I would actually do it..  Ohh well.. theres enough feeling sorry for myself right there..  Ohh yeah Nikki had her kid..  What a crazy life we're living..  Hope everything goes well for that kid.. Kinda scared seeing Nikki as a mom though..  Hope she does a better job with the kid then her mom did with her.. doubtful though..   I'm not a real beleiver in god but if anyone who reads this is that Kid needs all the prayers it can get..  Well I'm off to go finish my bottle of scotch and watch some more Sopranos..  NO class for me tommorrow..    Ed Asner said that "Raising kids is part joy and part guerilla warfare"  I feel that..  It could probably apply to most things in life..  especially women..  I need to go on the war path..  Alright.. I hope this isn't just a bunch of ramblings and maybe it will make someone here smile..  Peace out  kids..
