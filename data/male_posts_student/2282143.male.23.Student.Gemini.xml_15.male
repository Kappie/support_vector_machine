Master Park made me kick with a 5 year old again...  I know I am supposed to teach him, but its a bit rough.  I mean, the little guy doesn't even have control over his body!  So he cant really do the kicks and he definitely cant hold the target for me.  So I just tell him to stand back and I do my thing and try to not kill him.  At least if the kid is a bit older/taller, they can hang onto the target so I can at least kick it.  Oh well.  I guess I'm just not good at teaching the little ones.  Speaking of little ones, poor Stephan is moving again.  This kid showed up at the beginning of summer from I think Minnesota or something, and now he is moving to Florida on the 25th.  Doesn't even phase him.  I don't know how a kid can do that.  But I guess if that's how you are raised, then you can deal with it.  I mean, he's 12, he cant even make friends cause he just keeps moving.  I don't think I could do that to my kids when I have 'em.  Anyways, I digress...  After class, we did another 5 movements on staff.  Getting there... Only another 50 to go...  I just cant wait until we do that and then start on the Tai Chi sword form.  That and after everything else, we learned about chi flow and such as John realigned Lark with pressure points.  Very cool.  Might get into that later, but I think I will stick to the iron body for now.  Another month, and I get to start on my arms and hands.  Takes up more time and I might need to buy some equipment so I can practice at home, but its worth it cause I already am starting to feel improvement in my legs.  Keep it up and who knows what that will do for me.  So yeah, maybe I should do some homework so I can take my stats test.  Man, I hate stats...
