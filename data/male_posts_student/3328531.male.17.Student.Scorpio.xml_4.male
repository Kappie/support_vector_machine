I had been successfully eating “right” (if such a thing exists in a society that genetically alters basically all of our food) for about three months. However, at my lowest hour, fast food offered guidance and protection, and exploited my stomach; fast food used me like a five dollar hoe! I was at school, and after a long and grueling day an event took place that put the cherry on top of everything. I was frantic; I felt abandoned, ashamed, and psychotic. My mind was in a blur and my heart was telling me that I needed the dirty stuff (you know it’s bad when your heart is giving you bad advice). I literally jogged to the local fast food joint and ordered a Sourdough Jack with bacon, fries, and Coke ®. Of course, the food tastes like metal and wood, but I was appeased. I had broken my 3-month long boycott. I fell asleep as a result of the ensuing “food coma”. When I woke, I had a splitting headache and my stomach was doing back flips all the way to bathroom! The corporate machine that is the fast food industry is very strong and has the ability to stupefy you with great tasting fries. My addiction has started again; I eat fast food about three times a week. I try to stay away from it, but it always seems to make its way into my range! (The shuttle driver in DC dropped me off at McDonald’s instead of Howard!).  God bless the Big Mac (pray for me!). Another example of corporate control!
