Its going to be GREAT!  So yeah, today was pretty interesting...  kinda crazy though.  Yeah.. so these last couple (few? i forget) posts have been about Claire.. we split up today.  Things just weren't working out like they shoulda, but we talked about it and it went down nice and smooth and we are still cool with each other, so what more could I ask for?  It was pretty much a mutual feeling also, so that made it easier.  I mainly sat around the house today.  I went and played soccer with people, and it turned out being really fun.  It was a small group, and I liked it a lot better than when we have large group, because it just seems to be more fun.  Tomorrow is going to be an early morning, but it doesn't matter, because no matter how much sleep I get I'm pretty much going to be running off of pure adrenaline tomorrow.  I can't friggin WAIT.  Well, I'll post tomorrow night when I get back! I'm so friggin stoked!!!!
