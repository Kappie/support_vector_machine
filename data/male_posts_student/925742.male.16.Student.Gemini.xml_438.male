On thursday, I turned my speech cards in and also did some speech practice about Michael Jackson if he were normal.  And then when I got home I installed Kotor.  Nero 6 wouldn't make cd images, so Chris Parker gave me an ISO buster, and I opened and extracted the 4 bins.  And it worked, the install automatically found the data and everything.  Problem is, the cracked exe file doesnt work, and neither does the normal one.  SO fuck, I wanted to play KOTOR!  Oh well, Unreal Tournament 2004 rocks my socks with twin glocks.  Today I volunteered.  Yeah, and then picked up bruce almighty for tomorrow.  BTW, guys I'm probably gonna be home alone this weekend, so if you want to party, right here, motherfuckers.    Time to UT.
