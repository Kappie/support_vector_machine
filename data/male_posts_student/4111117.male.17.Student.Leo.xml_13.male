The IT festival was a moment i will remember most, although i wasn't there, simply because i felt so close to the band at that moment. all summer, leading up to my first show (7-12-03 Taste, Mexican Cousin, Stash, NICU, Heavy Things, Mock Song, Army of One, Maze. Piper, Two Versions of Me, Tweezer > Dogs Stole Things, Water in the Sky, Ghost, David Bowie. Frankenstein, Tweezer Reprise) i had this amazing closeness with the band, something indescribable. They meant more to me than anything i had come across; more than my family, more than my friends, more than writing or reading. Every happy thought i had ever experienced or ever wanted to experience culminated into 4 very special individuals. At the concert, i experienced more than i ever thought possible, things i've never told anyone happened there; the ten or so seconds when trey and i stared at each other, him digging off my energy. that beautiful, and i mean the most beautiful girl in the world, dancing a few feet in front of me and to my left, her hair flowing, smelling like some ethereal dreamlike olfactory scent, kicking my nose straight into my balls. i even saw my friend benj burke, the man who introduced me to phish.  But alas, it's all over, all of it. no more phish after august 15th. what will we all do?  "there are things you can replace, and others you cannot" you can't replace phish, you can't replace the memories and the feelings. you can only hold on to them, forever.  why is it that we never appreciate the truly important things until they are gone?  why is there no fall tour, no festival outside reno in the nevada desert, no more shakedowns, no more calls for set openers, no more BLISS or LIZARDS signs, no more Forbin narrarations, no more trey banter, no more chairman of the boards, no more greasy fizeek, no more vacuum solos, no more NYE shows, no more harry hood glowstick wars, no more of the infinitesimal things that make this community the best community on earth to belong to. i've entered it far too late, and really don't have much to say for it. i wish everyone of you who reads this will someday experience what phish has meant to me, because it truly is the most amazing experience in the world, far better than a blowjob, far better than saving a penalty, far better than even chilling at home with your friends. phish music is life music. they dedicate it all to you. you've got to feel something when You Enjoy Myself or Divided Sky comes on. if you don't, i'm sure you just haven't experienced life yet. no matter how many bands i will see, no more how many cd's i'll buy, nothing will ever compare to the time spent listening to phish, blazed or not, with friends or by yourself, driving or sitting on top of Red Mountain, they are always going to mean an immense amount to me. and i dare you to find anything that can improve your life as much as phish's music. for whenever the going is shit, the road you are leading is a little tilted and skewed, you can rely on phish to make your life great, by just listening to them play music. i owe an immense debt of gratitude to phish, for they honestly have changed my life. i can't comprehend life without them. on days when it was hard to get up, what got me up was knowing i'd be able to listen to them, to throw in 12-31-95 Reba, or the 11-19-92 Divided Sky, or some classic shows like 12-13-97, 8-9-98, or 12-14-95, and be saved. i've been saved by four goofy looking guys from vermont, who play the music they love because they love the music they play. it truly is time for the last rewind, this has all been wonderful, but now they're on their way, just when it's time you think to leave it all behind, you've got to find a way to but there's nothing i can say to make it stop. thanks phish, thanks ernest, thanks fish, thanks gordo, thanks mac, it's been a wonderful experience, thanks for the music.  and now i'm on my way. do yourself a favor: open your mind and listen to some phish. you'll never forgive yourself if you don't.  signing off
