Not in anyway. I enjoyed every moment of it.  By the way, if Jennifer Merrill is reading this, she should already be in the process of taking that pic down.  I've realized that I've been totally biased in music and still am but others are too. What I mean is that people don't enjoy certain music when it isn't their favorite type of genre. For example, say that a girl Clemingtine loves the music genre country, she has two friends: Rebecca, who prefers rock, and Suzanna, who prefers country. Now imagine a five point system based on Clemingtine's liking to a new artist. LeAnn Rimes would be a five, very likeable, and Metallica being a one, not likeable, and three being neutral. When Rebecca mentions a new band it starts out with a three, but then when she mentions the genre rock or when Clemingtine first hears the riffs that she can identify as being rock two points are automatically deducted for not being country. In order for the music to become likeable to Clemingtine the band somehow has to identify with country in any way for her to pertain any interest otherwise she will lose interest and stop listening. Whereas when Suzanna mentions a new band and is identified with country, two points are then automatically added to Clemingtine's liking scale and it most likely that she will pertain interest and listen to the rest of the song. Because of this mental behavior it is probable that it is the sole or main reason we listen to so many bands that sound similar. Also, one of the few reasons we switch to different genres of music is because of "crossover" artists that let us identify with what we already like and introduce us into something new. Otherwise, it is not often that we listen to and enjoy new music that is completely different.  Now all I have to do is prove this in an actual study.
