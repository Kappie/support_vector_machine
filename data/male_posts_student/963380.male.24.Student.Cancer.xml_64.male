An Inner Light - the episode where Picard is scanned by a probe and proceeds to live 45 years in 25 minutes. The flute that Kamen (Picard's alter ego) played - a penny whistle - produced one of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard. Patrick Stewart really did some fantastic work on this episode - you believe the man.
