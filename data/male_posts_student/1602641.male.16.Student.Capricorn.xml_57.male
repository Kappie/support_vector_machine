Going in, I was rather skeptical - I have always been a big fast food consumer, and have never worried too much about the impact it would have on my health. I didn't think that some movie would make me change my fatty ways. In fact, out of sheer defiance, I brought in a platter of chicken fingers and curly fries as a snack. (It even had golden honey mustard sauce - yuuummm!)  Needless to say, I was horrified. I watched a guy literally destroy his liver after a mere two weeks on a McDonald's-only diet. I watched him gain 25 pounds over the course of a month. I watched him vomit after attempting to consume a single Super Size fast food meal. I watched doctors tell him that, even if he resumed a perfectly healthy  diet, irrevocable damage had been done to his system.  I also watched some really, really fat guy in Texas undergo a stomach stapling operation. This was rather disgusting, to say the least.  Now, I am changed. No more salty, greasy, deep-fried, factory-processed junk food for me - at least not nearly as much of it. From this day forward, fruit, yogurt, and water will play much bigger roles in my diet than they did previously. But not vegetables. They're gross and they make me gag.
