It all started when I helped out a friend at SMU to provide sports massage services to Touch Rugby girls last Saturday. The turnout was  TERRIBLE  at best!!! Together with a few friends, we had to fork out roughly $40 to buy a few towels and massage oil.  That's not the worst part.  I was stupid enough to believe that by lowering the service charge to  JUST $2 , people will come to us in hundreds(literally). And, most of the participants were school girls who did not appreciate the effects of sports massage. So, that fateful day, my net profit was -$20.(So, by doing simple mathematics, you could figure out how many "customers" I had.) And, I really felt bad for not being able to pay the "volunteers" any tribute for helping out.  Thanks to one of the Lions Red girls, who really enjoyed my massage last Saturday, I had another chance to recoup my losses and try to earn some profit today. I learnt my lesson(or I should say LESSONS) and I upped the service charges to $5 for 15 minutes despite relatively strong protests from some of my friends. Haha!!! Ended up I had a net profit of ......(drumroll please)... around $100 !!! Also, thanks to the help of the ANG MOHS, who never batted their eyelids twice for giving tips! So, I was able to pay the helpers a decent amount of money for their services and enjoy some myself! And, that's not the BEST! They actually offered me to help out in another subsequent event coming up next week and also a BIG one at PADANG at National Day itself!(Not to mention the fact that I got to know a few more PRETTY girls at the event...muahahaha!) Seems like you will see another DONALD TRUMP in no time!    OUCH! (reality hammer hitting my head.) Ok. Ok. Maybe I may be a bit too ambitious(obnoxious I say). But, heh, what better job do you have that pays you to get to know more people (especially girls with well-defined bods) and widen your social circle! If you know of one, please tell me immediately and I will change my focus!
