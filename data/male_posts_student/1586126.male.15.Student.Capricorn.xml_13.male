If you do pay, 25 bux for 12 months, u get the full service, with lots of weird things.... like mood, music, and polls. (hmm polls!) i hope my parents pay me some months off (two months off, thats actually an option) and then ill get to work on that one and maybe ill finally leave this crap... or use this a s a thought blog, and thew live journal one as a general blog, where i write big entries about the day (which at this moment, has SUCKED big time, golly XD)  thats about it
