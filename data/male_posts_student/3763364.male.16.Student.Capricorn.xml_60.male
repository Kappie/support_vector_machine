We've got more things wrong with the world than matty not being able to find a girl. But yarrr, there be plenty 'o other fish in the big blue sea. Yeah, you know you like the sexy pirate man. Fuck that, take me to Davey Jones' locker. Maybe there are some nice, red headed mermaids there.  I just realized that I like bands headed by women. Especially rock bands. Arch Enemy, Kittie, No Doubt, BIF Naked, Garbage. WOOF WOOF! Baahahaha. Wow, I'm more of a typical male than I had once thought. They tell me that's a bad thing. Shit.  I will stand up now.  There are worse things wrong with this world. Why should I be any more important. Christ, I'm just gonna sign my vow of abstinence, then join the fucking green party.  You know, losing one's virginity is defined by having a male penis enter the body. So really, only straight women and gay guys can lose their virginity. Hopefully I might fit into one of those categories one day. Oh, matt, you crack me up sometimes.  We will rise.  Yay for passive resistance.  Sun, where are you? I can't quite see through all of the heavy metal.  Vote democrat or don't vote at all. I for one chose option b) Heheheheh.
