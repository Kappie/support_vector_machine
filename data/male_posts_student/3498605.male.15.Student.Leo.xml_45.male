This sounds familiar, right? Yea, it was the beginning to one of my posts, anyways, I've been thinking and wondering, should I even try? I mean, what if she isn't interested in me at all? What if she turns me down? I mean, do I even have a chance? So anyways, I don't know if I should continue to like randomperson1 or not, because at this point, I don't think I even have a chance.   later, bradleyJ
