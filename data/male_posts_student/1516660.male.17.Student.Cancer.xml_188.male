Today afternoon, I went to Wendy's house to complete my English homework. I took about 5 hours to complete my Paper 1. HaHa! Keep getting distracted. I talked to Wendy lor. Talk talk talk. Even I scolded Lassie today for licking my legs. Aww...Poor Lassie dog. But don't lick my legs ar! After completing my compo, I watched them (she and her mother) eat noodle soup. Then, I watched her mom play a PS game. Puzzle Bubble or something. I went home at 6.  Uncle Steven came yet again. He upgraded my RAM (to 228) and changed my mouse to an optical wheel mouse! YaY! No more rollers-cleaning. I bathed and watched TV (No need to tell you what they are...you should know by now, hor?) while eating. Then, I came online lor.  So today nothing much la. Tomorrow is wheen the fun begins. We (the whole family) is going to Chinatown to shop. And possibly eat at a seafood restuarant. So exciting. Hmmm....shark's fin! Alright! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
