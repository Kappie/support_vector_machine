Right before Tyke started blogging for tonight he decided to start working on his solilioquy for the first time.  He has spent less than 5 minutes so far on it and this is what he knows: To be or not to be, that is the question.  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and, by opposing them, end them.  To die, to sleep-no more.  Eh, thats pretty much it but considering he has hardly spent any time doing this and the only time he spent on it was while he was brooming so he wasn't really working very hard.  He can memorize that pretty easily he thinks.  Whoo...Tyke just left the computer for like 15 minutes just now.  He got some cake, talked to his parents, noticed a buzzing noise emanating from the upstairs TV, the lights just flickered, got his mom's Blockbuster card, and grabbed the papers he needs to hopefully get his community service signed off for his speeding ticket.  Now he is finally ready to do some serious blogging.  Although there isn't much to say.  Tyke had a pretty good 1st period today which was followed by a hard workout in weight training.  However, Tyke's left achilles tendon has been bothering him since he played basketball after school and that might be partly because of doing legs workout earlier on.  4th period was a snap today.  Tyke and Purdy talked about the interesting parts of their Sunday and the gang hardly even needed to do any bag ruffling like they always do.  It was an easy day.  The pizza at Pie today was spectacular.  A great slice of cheese today perfectly complimented by Tyke's addition of the ground peppers which is a tradition of his much like Dr. Phil's dousing of parmesan cheese.  The rest of the day eased on and Tyke came home to find out that a basketball game was being set up.  Tyke, Amed, Piggy J, and Maniak went out to Amed's court (still no sighting of Kheng and the Newport "gangstas") to play hoops.  It was a fun few games and then they played against some kids that were younger than them but obviously played basketball unlike Tyke's crew.  One kid was quite good.  Much better than Tyke even.  And another kid was better too in fact but he was big too.  He had a huge head.  It was like the size of Tyke's monitor for his computer.  MONSTROUS!  But Amed had to guard him so ha!  Well, 10.5 is starting now so Tyke is going to go back and watch what he started to watch last night.  It's fun to see these "disaster mini-series."  Nothing like a good fake catastrophe that takes out the entire west coast.  Let's go nuke some bitches!
