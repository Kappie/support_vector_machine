Putin's remarks looked certain to help President Bush, but officials at the State Department expressed surprise, saying they knew of no such information from Russia.  Putin said Russian intelligence had been told on several occasions that Saddam's special forces were preparing to attack U.S. targets inside and outside the United States." -  urlLink Reuters   Interesting revelation. I mean, Russia is a pretty respectable ally. I'm sure that our president - as intelligent as he is - would have most certainly informed at least the higher-ups that deal with national security of this information. And once that word got out, there would have been some kind of national emergency dealing with Iraq being an imminent threat. But apparently it's not very hard to prove me wrong. (from the same article by Raushan Nurshayeva)  ""This information was passed on to our American colleagues," he said. He added, however, that Russian intelligence had no proof that Saddam's agents had been involved in any particular attack.  State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters he did not know anything about the information that Putin said Russia passed on. No such information was communicated from Russia through the State Department, he said.  "Everybody's scratching their heads," said one State Department official, who asked not to be named.  But the Kremlin leader's comments seemed certain to bolster Bush, whose campaign for re-election in November is under pressure from the Iraq crisis.  Bush has been on the defensive at home for insisting -- against the findings of an independent commission -- that Saddam had links with al Qaeda, the militant group behind the 2001 airline attacks in the United States that killed nearly 3,000 people and prompted the U.S. war on terrorism.  Putin's remarks were all the more unusual since Russia had diplomatic relations with Saddam's Iraq and sided with France and Germany in opposing the invasion."  Well, isn't that just something special. I mean, soon after that, Iraq was alleged to possess stockpiles of WMDs and was labeled (although denied later) an imminent threat to the United States. Many people were skeptical of such claims. Wouldn't it make sense to pass on this information to a skeptical public for some assurance that the administration has its shit together?   Call me a skeptic, un-American terrorist, but I suspect that this is just another sign that the prez is desperate because his war and presidency is falling apart. It's a pretty clever scheme and damn, that election is getting pretty close.
