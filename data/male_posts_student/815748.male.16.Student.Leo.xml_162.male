After everyone has finished, he doesn't let us talk, doesn't let us whisper, doesn't let us signal to each other, doesn't even let us pass notes -- and today everyone finished over an hour early.  I couldn't even listen to music quietly.  Me-an.  Matt (K-K), if you're reading this, call me and tell me what, if anything, is going down tomorrow.  Then there was Loren and Melody and their awkwardness.  Ms. Heidlage told us about these two independent studies that we could do next year.  They both sound interesting, though I already have so much going on then.  One of them is focused around a book, which I checked out at the library today, where I saw Jonny, who I told something funny, which I had said to Dan Jung.  I know it's unethical to quote oneself (but, as I learned from a movie I watched yesterday, not immoral); too bad.    Dan Jung : So how was MCAS?  Alex : Are you kidding?  Easier than a Lithuanian prostitute.   In history, we're watching this chino movie called "To Live."  That produced the context of the following quotation that I misinterpreted as a threat.   Do you like 'To Live?' --- Matt Woolf    During MCAS yesterday, we were filling out the questionnaire, and Mr. Mitchell was like, "The answer to number seven is 'E'" and I thought it would be funny if the answer was like "I use marijuana 5+ times per week."  Then in French, on which Loren has been sitting in for the past two days, we're watching this movie called "Monsieur Batignole," and one of the characters, a boy, said "J'ai peur du noir!" which Ian translated fairly accurately as "I'm afraid of black!"  Loren has been so sexist in regard to "To Live."  He kept complaining about how the wife keeps crying, and the most recent time I was like, "It's her daughter's wedding, I think she has license," and then he was like, "Yeah, but then she also cried when her son died," and I was like "Yeah geez."  He also said the following comment:   It must be great to have a mute wife. --- Loren Chen    Oh me-an.  It's a good thing Loren is so timid and impressionable by his ladyfriends.  And finally, a line from "To Live":   After the ox is communism! --- Fugui , from "To Live"
