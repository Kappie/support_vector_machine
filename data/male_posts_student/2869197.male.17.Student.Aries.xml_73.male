I've already taken 4 exams (Govt, Chem, Psych, and Spanish) before the week even occurred. Math happened today. I felt good on most of it, except for the factoring segment at the end. If anything, that will kill me.  I continue to wait impatiently for a book I ordered. I know, fight that damn American one second patience syndrome, but I really want this book. It's about dreadlocks. Upon deep thought, I probably won't be able to pull off locks. My hair's about as Caucasian and straight and thin as you can expect from the descendent of some wooly iceman. But hey, a man's gotta dream right? My appearance is at 0 on a scale of 0 to any-number-you really-feel-like-at-the-moment. Getting shot in the face would improve my score. Scrapnel scarring is a great way to impress the ladies.
