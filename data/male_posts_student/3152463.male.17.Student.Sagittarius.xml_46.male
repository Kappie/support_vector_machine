Surprisingly, we didn't win; as every country under the sun donated 12 whole points to their neighbour. Cyprus voted for Greece, for example.  Another example of this highly unfair policy of voting for friends (this time Belarus is at it) :   Belarus Announcer : And 1 point to the UK ! Terry Wogan : Finally ! ... Belarus (later) : Finally, 12 points go to ... Terry Wogan : It  can't  be Russia ? Belarus : RUSSIA ! Terry Wogan : I've been doing this for too many years ...   France's entry was of note; featuring a bald woman on stilts and a smaller man singing *at* her ... Terry Wogan compared it to  The Little Prince .  The Netherlands entered  Reunion , consisting of two singers, one *playing* (I doubt) the guitar, the other singing - in a very awkward high pitched voice - about something which I have now luckily forgotten.  By the way, the Ukraine won, with another sloppy act worthy of absolutely nothing.  But,  The Calculus Affair  was very enjoyable ...
