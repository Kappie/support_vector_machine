Human history is full of succesful and failed conquests, but what effect has conquest had on society? Obviously one that is detrimental to development. Conquest, in terms of war, has ruined the world, and is accelerating the coming of the inevitable apocalypse. Take the example of England during the 19th and 20th centuries. The British Empire spanned from the Americas in the west to India and China in the east. Great Britain was truly great. In India, the British established harbors and proceeded to "acquire" the source of the spice they wanted so badly. They forced people to work for them, and pay taxes, while they grew fat off the spices and their steady flow of income and the people of India starved to death. In Sri Lanka, the British united two kingdoms into one they called Ceylon. In Africa, the British wanted the diamonds and the infinite riches. They forced African people to harvest diamonds. On average, ten African slave workers died to harvest one shiny rock. A shiny rock that the British nobility would wear, while they claimed they valued human life more than anything else. When the British granted independence to India, and Sri Lanka in 1948, they started a conflict that would rage on for half a century, still with no end in sight. In India, the exit of the British governemnt led to religious strife between the Hindus and the Muslims. After some violence, the Muslims moved to western India and created the state of Pakistan. The conflict between these two nations is still going on today in the Kashmir region. In Sri Lanka, the British gave power to the Sinhalese, one of the two groups they united, and hastily left. Now, the Tamils, who have been suppressed by the Sinhalese, want their own homeland. They have formed an organized military and are rising up agains the Sinhalese regime. In Africa, the nations once controlled by Western powers are in shambles. Today, once again, the Western World is hungry for conquest. The Korean Peninsula, Israel and Palestine, Vietnam, and the nations of the former Soviet Bloc have all felt the downside to "help" from the Western World. These nations, as well as those once controlled by Britain have an almost nonexistent economy, and thus are struggling for their survival. President George Bush conquered Afghanistan in the name of the Twin Towers of New York, and failed to conquer Iraq. The people of Afghanistan, as well as the people of Iraq now know that the Western World is not better than their tyrranical leaders. The people of the Western World know this too, but they do not want to accept it, because they want to be patriotic, or rather chauvinistic; because they want to be faithful to their country. The whole world knows that the apocalypse brought on by the Western powers is nearer, now moreso than ever. These wars, in the name of revenge and clashing ideals, are not necessary for the survival of humankind. While they may be a useful method for population control, they vastly suppress intellectualism. They inspire supsicion among people that were once the best of friends. War is detrimental to society, as well as the human mind. Conquest, in terms of war, is not necessary. Maybe one day, we foolish humans will realize that war, and conquest degrade our existence? Nevertheless, I doubt that this day may not come soon enough.
