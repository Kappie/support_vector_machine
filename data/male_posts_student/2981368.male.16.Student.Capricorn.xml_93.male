AND NO I DIDN'T STEAL THAT ONE FROM BLACKADDER  Citizenship wasn't too bad. The exam itself was a load of complete crap, about nothing in particular. Nick managed to injure himself by falling off his bike on the way there. And we got a new football. Which Ben had to climb onto a roof to get. One of them world cup ones. V nice.   Now we get a week of "study" before our next exam. Woohoo!!!
