He is one of those people who i wish to kill for being so noisy, irritating, stupid, idiotic and for being shorter then me.   Came to school just in time, people were reading their boring story books when i came. While i was walking down my class, to find a place to sit, i noticed that there were not quiet alot of absentees today. I sat down as usual and read my boring book. Well as usual lor went to class and had lessons. During recess i ate noodles and then went for my usual recess walk around the school. I went to the english corner and did it again, cutting my wrist, then i went to the canteen again let my blood flow.   Well while walking down the stairs, to go back to class, i saw HIM (nicholas) pulling down the cuirtains to my  ENGLISH CORNER . He pulled it twice and the string broke and everything fell. I got so angry i shouted really loud,  "NICHOLAS! FUCK YOU LAH!",  and threw my water bottle to the closed section of the entrance causing a loud bang. Many of the guys were shocked to see me get angry, many have not seen me get really reallyangry, many stopped me from beating him up but i pushed them away and pulled HIM by the collar, felt like crying, and shouted at him in the face,  "EH!? YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EFFORT OR NOT TO PUT UP THAT ENGLISH CORNER!? AH!? YOU MOTHER FUCKER!?",  luckily there were no teacher around. I let him go and quickly walked into the class while pushing every one away. The guys went,  "AIYO! NICHOLAS! NICHOLAS!...",  many asked me what was wrong i just kept quiet in anger, a tear oozed out from my eye. I just shouted in class,  "SO MUCH EFFORT PUT IN AND NOW ITS ALL GONE! FUCK YOU NICHOLAS! ALL THIS WHILE ITS YOU!".  He just kept quiet and did not look at me.   The last bell of the day rang, i picked up my bag and rushed out of the classroom. I went up to the fourth floor, where the art room is, not realising that Ern Leng, he isone of thecutest guyto me andbeen having abig and deep crush on him since last year,was there. I saw him and looked at him but i just looked away when he saw me looking at him. After that i did not look at him again. I saw my friend, Atiqah at a table near by, and came up to her. I realised that someone was looking at me so i turned back, it was him peeping out from this classroom trying to get a glimpse of me. I just ignored him. Soon i walked away from them and waited for my teacher on this stretch of path. Leaned against the railing waiting for my art club teacher. Soon i realised that Henry took Ern Leng's bag and ran towards my direction, i just looked at them running towards, passed me and away from me. Ern Leng chased after him but Henry changed direction and came back running towards my direction but this time i did not looked at HIM (Ern Leng) i just ignored him. Some thing fishyisgoing on. How come when ever i want to make the move, he will move away from me but when i ignore him or try to move away from him, he or his friends would try to make me look at him or at least him come near me. Is it me? or is it that alot of people from Ern Leng's class knows about me being gay and having a crush on him? Oh well what ever it is. Soon my teacher came and opened the door to the art room. I put my bag there and went off to Mcdonalds.   When i was there i ate a HAPPY MEAL, well it did made me cheerful abit. After that i sat down and chatted with my band juniors, joked around and bitch around. Soon i had to go and went back to school for ART CLUB. I had to do a proposal for my art work. Sheesh! so many things to do when you have a project. I had to come out with more ideas for my art work. Walau! so many stuffs to do. Haiz... i just wishif i hadboyfriendso that hecan help me think of some ideas. After Art Club i went home and had a short nap. So now here i am typing this blog.   Haiz... i am a litte nervous because tomorrow is the  WOODLANDS RING MILITARY BAND INVESTITURE 2004: MOOZICA FANTASIA.  I have to be in school very early.
