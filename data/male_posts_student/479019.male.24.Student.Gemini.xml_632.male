       
      [14947]  Ok so my plan for today:    Now: Go through my ILL books.  2:00 PM-ish: Go to campus to mail  Me, Myself, and Irene  back, return books, and photocopy stuff.  Probably 4:00 PM: Come home and clean.  Do some writing.  Decide what to make for dinner.  Maybe go grocery shopping.  9:30: Maybe go to a party.   Energy is something I could really use.
