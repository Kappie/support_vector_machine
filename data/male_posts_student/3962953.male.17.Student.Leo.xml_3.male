No spamming, unless it gets the message across, admins may edit out the spam, and leave only the message, or delete the post all together if it has no meaning...  2. Post titles, this isn't really THAT necessary, however I would feel much better if the titles given to the posts were related to the posts themselves, admins may also edit the titles to a related term, or to a default term as well.  3. No offensive dialog, I know that this appears on ALL forums, and such but it really does make sense when you think about it, now how would you feel if someone cussed you out on the weblog, and you had NO way of finding them, just so you could beat the living crap out of-em...... I wouldn't like that too much............. if anyone I know tries it...... I swear, i WILL beat the living crap out of-em, just watch, most swearing is alright, however, if used in an offensive manner, you will be warned...  4. Feedback, whenever anyone posts either their ideas, or comments, they are to be seriously taken into consideration... Unless however, its just an offensive thing..... in which case, they will have the living crap beat out of-em if I can find em, thank you.  ALSO: feedback should NEVER be rude, completely negative, or give the person no credit, doing so will, once again, cause some beat-age of living crap... Thank you again... that's about it, if anyone does something which ANY of the admins find rude, or not appropriate, it will either be removed, edited...
