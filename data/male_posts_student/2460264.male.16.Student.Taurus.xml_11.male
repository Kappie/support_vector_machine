Today was pretty good actually, I got very little homework which is actually the best thing that's happened to me all week.  I don't have much to say today, I'll probubly write more tonight when the night is over. I'll catch you guys later.  Do the Question of the Week. Finish this sentence: The worst thing about ______ is _______. email me your answer and you might win something and I'll tell you my answer.  My email: onelessthanyou@hotmail.com   "Tomorrow (we meet the end of today's lie) it'll work itself out, don't take this anymore."
