While it was not my fault that she put two sugars in my coffee when I clearly asked for one, I should have found a better way to deal with it than by calling her a cow.  It was my mistake, and I assure you it will not happen an excessively large number of times in the future.   Thank you for telling me I didn't have to wear a suit to court, even though you were obviously kidding and I knew that and decided to pretend you were serious anyway, because I really didn't want to wear a suit.  I know it was awkward for us to meet down at the courthouse, you in your suit and me in a gorilla costume, but I'm sure the judge understood.  I was only trying to be amusing.  How was I supposed to know that our client's wife was eaten by a gorilla?  Or that the court reporter was a very hairy man who would think I was his long-lost brother?  It was all an unfortunate misunderstanding, and I completely agreed with you when you suggested afterwards that I might want to avoid going to court anymore this summer.  Thank you for not telling anyone I have genital warts.  It was probably an inappropriate thing to share with you during the client meeting, but it seemed relevant at the time.  It was only afterwards when I realized the client had said he liked "sports," not "warts."  My mistake.  Also, once again, thank you for paying me.  Your friend, Summer Associate
