(no sniffles or sore throats,etc.) ....  but most importantly ... for the first time... in a very very long time... i think... ok... i know... i am really truly happy again... i owe that to the fact that summer is around the corner and school is ending, but also, and most importantly to one person... anyways... i am good.. hell great.... and i can't wait for things to keep getting better... because... like i said ... things seems to be looking up... and right now... not to be cliche... but i feel like the sky is the limit....  -Nate :)
