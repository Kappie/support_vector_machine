If only the bullpen could live up to the starting staff... as is, Dusty might as well leave the starters in the whole game.  On another note, my aunt recently got married and has to get rid of her cat Izzy because my uncle is allergic.  My family was going to take Izzy, but apparently she is not "friendly" enough for my mom, the older of my little sisters, and my brother.  Pity; I rather like Izzy, I must say, even though she hisses a lot right now because she's not used to us.  *rolls eyes*  She'd get used to us eventually if we'd just take her.  Today was my mom's annual family reunion picnic.  We played volleyball for a long time and I had a lot of fun, even though I got a splinter in my toe.  I'll end this post with a joke I heard today:       Son:  "Daddy, do all fairy tales start with 'Once upon a time?'"      Father:  "No, many of them start 'If elected, I promise...'"
