I sat down and watched the first season for the third time yesterday. I still think it's very good, but I'm subconsciously memorizing all the words. That doesn't make too much sense, because I am very aware that I am memorizing all the words.  I am very, very tired today. It's only 9 a.m. and I'm bored out of my mind. Work isn't very exciting.   I bought the  urlLink  Shrek 2   soundtrack and  urlLink Ryan Adams'   Love Is Hell  the other day. Both are very good. I especially like his version of Oasis' "Wonderwall". It's probably even better than the original.  I was reading the Wichita Eagle's  urlLink opinion line  and became annoyed. Why? Let me quote it for you:  "It's official: Shrek is more popular than Jesus Christ."  I want to make it clear that I hate the opinion line. It is the most useless and irritating feature in the  urlLink Wichita Eagle . It's function is to allow people to get their opinions published in the paper. Unfortunately, hardly any of the opinions that get published are rational or well thought out. Most of the opinions are ignorant or, to be blunt, stupid.   Now about the above opinion: obviously this reader is upset that  urlLink  Shrek 2   is making more money than Mel Gibson's   urlLink The Passion of The Christ  . I don't think the remiter of this opinion took much time to try to understand why that might be.   At the time   urlLink The Passion   was released, someone said that they saw it "being a devout Christian." That really annoyed me. Why? Because I am a devout Christian and I don't think I'm less of one just because I didn't see Gibson's film adaption of Christ's crucifixion. I am literate (that's not why I didn't see the film) and I can read it for myself in The Bible.   I saw  urlLink  Shrek 2  , but not   urlLink The Passion  . Just because I saw  urlLink  Shrek 2   and I didn't see   urlLink The Passion   doesn't mean I worship Shrek. He didn't pay for my sins.  It should be noted that the  urlLink  Shrek   movie was made for a much broader audience. It's movie for everyone. Though Christ's love is for everyone, I'm sure the film is not. It's bloody violent and deep. For a powerful movie that is short, moving and to the point, watch  urlLink  The Lamb of God  . It is amazing and, more importantly, truly family friendly.  Word.
