Today I bought two more volumes of Neil Gaiman's  Sandman  series (Volume IV  Seasons of Mist  and Volume IX  The Kindly Ones .....I already had  Preludes and Nocturnes , volume I) as well as the other  Death  mini series (I already had  The High Cost of Living ....the one I bought today was  The Time of Your Life ).....I also bought True Romance and an issue of Stuff (the best to date....I am about to subscribe)....  Back to Neil Gaiman's work....I am so angry with myself for not getting into it earlier....back in high school I used to buy comic books from my friend Carmen's brother Andy....and he would always try to get me into Sandman but I was too much into X-Men....my mistake....the incorporation of mythology and literature into comics is amazing to me....I can't wait to read the rest of the series....  Ugh....relationships....I wrestled with whether to bother to put anything at all about last nights events here considering my readership (or the fact that the person concerned here reads this....by the way how messed up is if for you to read my stuff and not give me the address for your stuff?)....anyway....I don't wanna fight no more....I'm spent....I'm punch drunk....I'm dazed.....like BP's favorite Deceased Princess and subject of many a female homoerotic crush (it warrents mentioning that most of these females hated her when she was alive....how shady is that?) Aaliyah sang, "we need a resolution"....anyway I'll leave it at that....
