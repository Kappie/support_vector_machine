I gave the presentation part of my term paper/presentation on Paul McCartney Tuesday, it went exceptionally well, even if it was a little long.  And, hey, look at that calendar, it's already finals time again. It has been a very good semester, and hopefully it will end well. And I get a four day weekend afterward.
