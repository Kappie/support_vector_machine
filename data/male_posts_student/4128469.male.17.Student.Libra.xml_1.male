Sometimes you think you know what you're doing then read that and you clearly don't. Student union will be murder I will turn into an alcoholic and I am buying a laptop next month so that will get nicked when im vulnerable or swapped for a Jack D or something. Girls Aloud doin' the freshers week sounds....class. The Libertines are number two, amazing for a band that good I listened to the chart for first time in ages there is some amount of pish floating around the now i must say especially what got to number one that babycakes mince, aw well I wonder if this will be The Libertines premature peak big Carl has already said he won't make another Libertines album without Pete, but Pete won't get back in 'til he is clean, but he says he won't so..... Theres now 5 merry men young; Cooney has joined aswell, me and Downey are lookin feeble, have to learn some new lingo Andy, at uni goin into second year. Cheesy, advanced english. Cooney, goin' to St Andrews, 8 1s 5 H As then 3 AH As. And me wae ma B in english and Downey with his C, looking bleak ! . Anyway work tomorrow theres a good chance I won't last the week I'm gonna hate it plus its always gonna be in my mind I'll have to give it up for uni anyway so even though I know i never would enjoy it anyway I will always be making sure I hate it just incase. I watched scarface again today that film is class, big Al Pacino knows where its at. This mincey B in english is coming into play cos I am aw over the place, got to text Jean and see what happened with his ill-fated shindig. Well I will write in this tomorrow for my ardent fan base of none and tell a sad soliloquoy of my tale of woe via cogent in Airdrie. Adios
