I took it with my new camera, a Kodak EasyShare DX4530. It's pretty good, with a dock, 5.0 MP and 3x optical zoom. All for $470 ($200 of which payed by the insurance company!)  Now, the past week was exams, and I did pretty good in chem and physics (I hope), and pretty damn good in Maths C. Now, what I'm worried about is my Maths B exams. It was today, and I think I did pretty shit. It's bad, because I'm gonna get an A in C, but a C (or worse!) in B. How depressing.  I still haven't started my English assignment with Tanya yet. I think we're royally fucked!  I haven't heard from Kieran in ages. I hope he's OK! I would call him at the hospital, but I don't know which one he's staying at.   Um, yeah. I'm bored now!  I'm still working on the new CSS layout. I'm takin my time, hey.  Noone comments any more. I think I'll cry!
