Another guy, Gabriel, from my group is also in VJ chorale and he's the student conductor. Berneese from the UWC group is now the Arts faculty president in her college and darling Jolyn is the Vice President of AC's drama company. Sharm's got a place in the committee and Leon Toh, Debra, Khin and Shyama have each received a 72 thousand dollar scholarship. Heh.. seems like so many of the people I know have made it. I'll leave it to you to decide what IT is, coz I know that that's a question you'd ask me. Is power desirable? Is envy desirable? YES! it is! For me at least. Now, don't get me wrong. I may envy these people, but I'm very happy for them too. I entered ACJC wanting to make a difference. To prove something. That a Fairsian could make it in a place dominated by ACS(I)'s and (B)'s and MGS's. I was almost there. but the keyword here, dear reader, is ALMOST. Farewell my finery. So.. heh... what's tim? I don't know, maybe it's time I woke up and realized that not all leadership depends on position. I know so much about this and philosophy and shat like that yet I DON'T PUT IT TO USE! And all it does for me is make me miserable. Ho.  I spoke with Zhu Ping till 4am then decided not to sleep after that too. He's exceptional in many ways- inclusive of a level of finesse in wit which few possess. I realized that many judge the value of an actor by the role he plays. It's true and actors who read this are likely to agree. What ever happened to "There are no small roles, only small actors"? We also realized that the Fairsian character is liked everywhere except AC. We have fun being stupid and they entertain themselves by killing each other. Damn them all. Bitter about it still. Don't know if I'll ever get over it.  Today, I woke up half an hour after I was supposed to meet Jolyn, Sharmini and Joo Sheng at Boon Lay. I felt pretty bad about it and took  cab down. We went to Raffles Marina and headed off on a fisherman. You can see the fisherman in this link here.  urlLink Fisherman . So anyway, we got on and floored it north east at about 33-34Km/h. Fast enough thank you very much. Sheng was a great host. OK. I have to say that my life is filled with the "lighter" kinda fun like expeditions rather than the darker kind like.. I don't know.. Smoking and pubs. So anyway, I always tell all my friends that there are 2 places which I belong. On the stage and on the water. These are my passions. However, I wasn't HAPPY today though I tried to be. We did it all! Sharp 360's, 720's, full throttle, sat at the bow with face and hair full of wind but I didn't get there. Call it a type of Nirvana. I'm sad that I wasn't happy. Well, at least the girls were pleased, so as an entertainer, I did my job.  For now, I'll sleep uneasily because I have all the undone revision waiting to kill me when I return from CAP. I think I might screw up my terms. P.S.H.A.W.! Will bring work along to squeeze in during plenaries or break times which I doubt will happen.  I will be at CAP next week so this is likely to be my last entry for the next six days. HOWEVER, rest assured I'll have a tale to tell when I return. I have high expectations of myself and my ability "with people". I will test that ability during the next six days and we'll see if the old spunk's still about Tim. Wish me luck and for the Christians, say a little prayer for me would you. That I may find what I'm looking for.
