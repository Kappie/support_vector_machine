And it will only get less , cause the skin of my right palm is starting to peel again ( its that time of the year i guess ) and its hurting too. I also found out that it is not wise to go shopping alone. You need all those extra hands you can get when you are buying really heavy stuff. I bought a set of kitchenware and sweated my way back to the apartment ( its winter btw ). I've been walking around alone a lot lately , i wonder why...  Anyways back to the food. Lip Zhun's family is in town , and his parents were kind enough to treat me n Kafaii to a luxurious dinner. Lobster noodles.....OOHHHH SYOOKK!!! Something we wouldn't enjoy for a loooooooooooong time. And the other dishes we're unbelivably delicious too! Yummy. And just last night , i walked to Grattan ST to tapau some nasi lemak. They tasted good , obviously not as good as back home , but good enough. That afternoon we also got the chance to try Gelati ( some italian icecream u noobs ) Omg its the best ice cream ive ever tasted! Texture smooth as silk , flavour rich as ummmm Bill Gates ? Oh god that's lame. Must be too much kafaiism. Hmm.... And oh yah i cooked dinner ! Without professional help ! Really ! God and it actually tastes good too. Here is the pic of my newly created dish :    * Yes , yes it doesn't look appetizing but it tastes good ! I promise !*  I forsee an interesting and busy week in front of me , especially with drama. We have to do a 2 min solo mime performance each ( mime = acting without props and sound ) That's gonna be something.....
