In a way it is fun - Dad is the first place I've yet been where there is  real , old-fashioned digital satellite - except it's of a new-fashioned 'Sky Plus' variety which allows you to record two things simultaneously to hard-disk and 'pause live TV'. So I'm pretty much like the rat with the morphine drip. On the downside, my Dad's weight problems (although he is by now easily slimmer than I've ever seen him, and looking pretty sprightly for his 68 years, moreover)continue to mean that there continues to be no snack food of note in the house. Basically visits to Dad have not significantly changed in the 10 years that I've been coming alone to see Dad. That dreadful continuity again. Changes are superficial: Dad has coloured his hair chestnut and now has a golden Buddha hanging round his neck - ten years ago it was a golden inscription from the Koran. Dad is a bit more serious about his Buddhism than his Islam, but then again, this is only because it is possible to be a Buddhist with a relatively low level of commitment. Anyway, Dad's about to move to Thailand more-or-less, which should make visiting him a bit more interesting - not that I don't love seeing him. Although I mean that, I have to say it - which is the weirdest thing about blogging. There's a lot of things, or  people , more to the point, that I'd normally be fucking caustic about, but who could read this, so whom I just can't diss.
