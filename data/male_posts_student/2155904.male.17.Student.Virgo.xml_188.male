And today wasn't as bad as it could have been.  Tyke got up at 10 but since he went to bed fairly early last night (fell asleep before midnight) he wasn't all that tired.  He still didn't get out of bed until 11 though.  But eh, NBA playoff basketball is more fun thatn moving around anyway.  As well as the Mariners, who actually hit pretty well today for like the 3rd time all year.  When he finally did get up he actually ate a breakfast.  Only a blueberry muffin but those are very delectible when they are consumed correctly.  Then he watched some more of the playoffs and Mariners game before playing his own ESPN game.  Then he went upstairs and talked with his mom about some stuff and then they went downstairs and fixed the cabinet under the sink in Tyke's bathroom.  It was a funny way to break that door in the first place though.  Tyke was wearing his blue cargo shorts and he turned to leave the room and kinda had a fast walk or a little jog about to start but part of his cargo pocket caught the door handle and ripped off the door hinge.  It was really weird.  Tyke tried to put it back together but he couldn't so he called his mom for assistance and together they put it back together.  Tyke isn't that handy at this stage in his life but he wants to be.  He also wants to learn how to cook.  Basically he wants to learn how to do things that would make him a better husband.  Truthfully, that is the primary reason for him wanting to improve such qualities.  Not a bad reason though.  Tyke thus started on his homework for English, which is pretty much the only class he really needs to do homework in.  Oh wait, maybe Math too.  Drat!  Hahaha, his mom uses that word a lot.  It must rub off on Tyke.  She occasionally says shit and bitch and damn but never fuck.  Tyke wonders if his parents know he swears.  His brother should but maybe not his parents.  He is pretty different around his parents.  Much more reserved for sure.  And hardly ever talks with them about his problems.  Could be a bad thing but it doesn't really trouble Tyke.  He could talk with them if he wanted to but he just doesn't want to most times.  Let's see...what else did Tyke do today?  He worked on the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern questions for much of the day.  He did the first 20 all on his own before Dr. Phil got online and Tyke asked him if he wanted to split up the work.  They got Amed involved as well but when Amed and Dr. Phil got together to work on the questions they didn't have the actaul questions.  Tyke tried to get them the questions but couldn't so they ended up calling Macaroon and he had already done them all so he just sent them to everyone to paraphrase.  Tyke kept his first 20 but then just used Macaroon's for the second half.  Then they went to play basketball at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke came near the end of their first 21 game when Amed had 19 points so Tyke wasn't able to win that game.  But then the next game he did win.  And then they played like 5 two on two games.  Tyke's team won every time.  When Tyke and Dr. Phil were teammates, Tyke scored all of the team's points.  Tyke has gotten so much better this year at basketball.  He dominates whenever he plays with the Issaquah guys (not counting Kinker but he hasn't played with them in a while).  Now Tyke has gotten confidence too which means he always wants the ball in his hands.  And his jumpshot has improved a lot too.  Oh yeah, you guys probably don't care about all this.  Oh well, Tyke does.  After bball Tyke came home and got some dinner at Burger King.  Then he came home and finally exchanged gifts with his dad for his birthday, which was last Tuesday.  But it has been a hectic week for Tyke's parents.  They are still very tired.  And another thing that happened this week is that Tyke's grandma (Dad's side) lost her sister at the end of the week.  First her husband, now her sister.  Definitely a tough week for her.  That has to be simply terrible.  Tyke hopes he can be so lucky as to not have to go through the pain of losing a very close loved one and then once he starts to heal, find out that another of his close relatives has died.  It is a part of life though and death has to be dealt with.  But it makes it easier when you can at least separate the deaths from other tragedies.  Anyway, now that Tyke has paraphrased the rest of his work he is going to go try and print off the questions.  Actually, no he is not.  His dad just came downstairs and said that he is still having problems so he is going to try and do it but if he can't, well he can't.  Unfortunately Tyke has to go back to regular school schedules again as well as the return of the rain.  The only thing he has to look forward to this week is getting to drive the Avalon on Tuesday, going to dinner with Purdy and Tina on Wednesday, and the week being over on Friday.  Wow, after Monday Tyke's countdown will be at 29.  In the 20s.  This is getting exciting.  And sad.  Tyke doesn't want to leave some of his friends behind at all.  The beginning of college will be fine in that Purdy and Tina are going to come down and visit Tyke and Ekul at WSU but once they leave again it will be long spurts between visits.  Sad.  But Haras should be back at school tomorrow if Tyke remembers right.  They haven't talked for a while really.  And Dotti gets back later this week as well.  And hopefully Ashland is worth it for Tyke.  Love.
