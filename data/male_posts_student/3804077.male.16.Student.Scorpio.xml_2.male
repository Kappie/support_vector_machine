You feel like your ontop of the world! I love that feeling.. sadly I've recently lost it.. And now I'm lost.. She was everything to me and its so hard to try and hide the emotions inside.. I feel so lost and cold.. worse then the feeling before I had her... When you find that person who completes you, then you lose them.. You drown, and choke to death... Thats what it feels like for me atleast... I'm slowly losing my life and can't stop it, but I'm trying my best to avoid being sad.. I'm trying to look happy atleast...   The weirdest thing was, it was a net relationship. You'd think one wouldn't care or get so attached.. Well I did... I had to be with her man, she made me feel so good about myself.. She made me feel so special and I was going to move where she lived soon.. Now I'm stuck in my little circle hoping for what happened to be nothing but a dream.. Some of you probally think guys shouldn't cry or whatever but sometimes we can't help it.. I loved this girl so much.. and I still do.. and I don't know how to prove it though.. I don't know how to make her happy anymore, and I don't know how things got like this... I just wish it was all a dream..   I love her, and that'll never change... she knows who she is... *blows her a kiss*
