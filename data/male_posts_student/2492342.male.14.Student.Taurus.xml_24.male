Oh! yeha, we went over our homework. it was boring, but not exhausting like it usually is. The...assembly. Khoda, that was odd. It was joint Chinese New Years and Eating Disorders for our theme.   but it was less awkward than i thought. they did quick thing with the chinese language students (among which there were only 3 chinese people) where they said a new years phrase. interesting.  than for 30 mins a woman acted out a monologue of 4 different people about a girl with an eating disorder. it was good. but at the end, they had a panel of 5 people come out to answer questions about eating disorders....but, why would you ask a real question in front of 1,200 other people? people asked about stats and stuff. Mhm.  First half of biology we talked about(they talked, i thought about cheering up Jennifer) it and jennifer cried next to me. im not sure if it was about eating disorders? or what? maybe a friend? who knows. i drew on a paper and gave it to her, but she left it afetr class and i took it.  it had a heart with hands trying to hug, and it said dont worry be happy. on the bottom i wrote 'mhm..pathetic...oh well' or soemthing. but thats ok.  we then proceeded to talk about vascular systems of plants. fuck plants.  history....history of the money system was boring, but the second part was actually rather fun..and..interesting. lol, that was only cause we tried to interpret political cartoons instead of taking hard notes or anything.  hmm...the republican junior (i dont know his name..just know hes very republican..lol..he could be senior) is doing some story on irans revolution and someone who was there during it. theyre looking over it (him and ms allen)..ack accents are really annoying. Ooooo theyre tlaking about khomeini. im sure hed crucify me (pun intended, its not really a pun, but ok) if he knew that we were related and i ahve pictures in my photo albums of him.   Long live kHomeini. lol   how the hell did this guy run to pakistan? its hundreds of miles from tehran? hed die in the desert? oh well.  back to today... lunch..i ate with aria at first, then walked around with coke and cookie. i saw sara at the book fair and her mom was there.....it seems that she 'babbled' about me 'freshy this..'  ugh. what lies. he is syaing that the US and UN saved him from indian deportation to iran and further execution. damn biased republicans. lol  ahh i should stop.  then..PE...i ditched and sat with rina...she put her head on my lap for awhile...then i left her, after she left me, and went around with lauren...then got rina and brought her to us..she had been talking to jess, making up with her or somethign cause she unintentionally said something bitchy to her...lol  then...spanish..we got to see our tests. we elarned the future..which..i...already...knew.... but ok.  mwahaha, inredibly simple. but thats ok. ill ignroe this fact.  it seems my momc alled him about my final. KHODA MAN-E!!! CHERA?? Ach, i was fine. 88 is awesome for a final. and yet she calls about it., that is so incredibly..UGH. but they continued talking and he invited to go to my spain on some special trip he hosts.....even tho im going in march....but thats ok..id rather stay with roberto in argentina...but why did she talk to him about that? ach, what about me knowing the future..lol..anything? just to get out of that.  mhm, brighton had some weird problem with food or something. theres three thing sit coudl be. Oh, she asked me if i had read her LJ and is aid i lost my password so i couldnt and she said good, cause she had written somew weird stuff about food. the tan bitch. that was loving. so its either:  a) she has eating problem/disorder b) she used it for 'bad' things/*cough* cant say that wrod. young ears. or, c) somehtign happened with food that doesnt matter.   alright.  i should go..i saw mom come like 5 mins ago...  much love  peace  ~alex
