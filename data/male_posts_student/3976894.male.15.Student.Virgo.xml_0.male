The currency here is called nuevos soles, or soles for short. And the currency exchange is 1 US dollar = 3.6 soles. Now thnk about it, i am the richest dude in Peru. Things are so cheap. I went to the supermarket and bought ten 2-liters of sodas for 5 soles total. Thats like $1.50 US money. I love Peru, and IÂ´m thinking of living here when I grow up, lol. I am recording a lot with our digital camcorder, so I might stream it later on my new website.  Here is the typical meals of the day. Breakfast is a peice of hard bread with old milk. EveryDay. Lunch is the big meal around here, and it usually has chicken in it. EVERYTHING has chicken it here in Peru, even the orange juice. There is no dinner here, only a cup of tea and bread. Sad, I know.  I have to go now, my hour ran out, since i was on GB for a while. Bye!
