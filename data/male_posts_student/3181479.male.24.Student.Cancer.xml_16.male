Here are the pictures.       urlLink Me with the Pacific Ocean in the background.       urlLink Me and the Boardwalk.       urlLink Fred and the ocean.    urlLink Again.       urlLink Fred and the Boardwalk.       urlLink Fred dancing.    urlLink Again.    urlLink And again.    urlLink One more time.    urlLink This one's particularly blurry.    urlLink This one's not so bad.    urlLink Extreme close-up.    urlLink A blurry close-up.    urlLink Last one.    urlLink And finally, a movie.     Coming soon: Part 2, Berkeley...
