Her and I were going to hang out tonight, but instead, we are going to hang out tomorrow night. Tonight at the mall must have been like "Hot Guy Night" or something. I don't think I've ever seen so many hot guys at one time. Josh and I were checking out guys left and right. Carrie, Melanie and Chris came to the mall tonight too. I didn't talk to them for very long because Brandon came to pick me up. We came back to my house and chilled for a while. Then I asked Holly if we could come over. Of course she said yes, because I'm her Shnookie. I'm on my way to Holly's house and Carrie calls me. She tells me that Chris FINALLY asked her out. I was so happy for them. Chris is a really cool guy and Carrie is so frickin awesome. I kinda felt like Melanie was mad at me for something tonight. Anyway, Brandon and I get to Holly's house and we start talking about random things. Then out of the blue, we got on the subject of sex. Boy was that conversation funny. Two gay guys and a straight girl talking about sex. You will have to read Holly's diary if you want details. I'm sure that she prolly went into a little more detail than I did. Let's just say that Holly, Brandon and I should not start our own town. HAHA. Tonight was actually an awesome night. Well, I might as well end this entry. Later tricks.
