NO USABLE PICTURES EITHER...  I need my clothes back bean... Stop dressing like a gay guy!  Filed trip tomorrow = loads of pictures of my friends from 3rd block on the bus and in Richmond. Also = less hw tonight.  After taking about 200 pictures last week for Ledger (school newspaper) I officially hate photojournalism and basically people in general. My moms a bitch and so are other moms, I wont go into detail, so I hate moms too.  I want to go dancing in the rain...
