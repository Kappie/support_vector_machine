I'd like to see a report where there actually *aren't* any hostages or beheadings.    But what's worse than the fact that this is becoming non-news is the fact that there are three men who are about to be beheaded by terrorists.  We see this so often now that it is pathetic, and my anger has turned into exasperation.  How much longer will these barbaric tactics be used before we get tough on those who use them?  The terrorists claimed that "(the prisoners) will receive the just punishment of being beheaded" if Turkey doesn't give in to the terrorists.  I can't help but wonder where the folks who decry the death penalty in America are right now.  Shouldn't they be leading the fight to apprehend these monsters?  Last time I checked, beheading wasn't generally considered a "just punishment," especially if the punishment is for something that has no connection with the person being punished.    The horror that I feel about these beheadings is becoming more widespread, however.  Unfortunately, anti-Muslim sentiment (of the violent kind) is * urlLink reported * to be rising.    While I am completely against the radical Muslims who terrorize our country and our world, I am not violent about it, and I disagree with those who are.  The following statement, however, just strikes me as loony:   "It's really our fear coming true," said Faiza Ali of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "It indicates a hatred that could turn into something violent."    Hmm, I wonder if the hatred he speaks of is anything like the hatred that has been attacking the Jews and Americans for years.  After all, that hatred turned violent long before 9-11.    The moderate Muslims, as they are called, need to speak out against the radicals, and they need to join the forefront of the fight against radical Islam in order to prove their goodwill.  Presently, those claiming to be moderates do little to turn in the radicals or to fight the radicals, but they then whine when they are suspected of sympathizing with or being terrorists.  This is typical abuse of freedom.  When Muslims behead an American, the Palestinians are filmed dancing in the streets, and the American Arabs hold memorial services-- not for the victim of Muslim agression, but for the victim of anti-Muslim violence.  The least these folks could do is remember Nick Berg as well, and speak out against terrorism of all kinds.   We live in some crazy times, and we are under siege.  No longer do our enemies plant themselves outside the borders of their enemies and fire inward; now they infiltrate the society and attack from the very heart of their enemy.  It is now hard to distinguish between friendly civilians and enemy terrorists; the terrorists try to blend in with their civilian counterparts and the friendly Muslims aren't very helpful in finding the terrorists, or even in proving that they aren't terrorists themselves.  Pre-emptive strikes on suspected terrorist strongholds both inside America and abroad are the only way to defeat our enemy.  There is no standing army to confront on the battlefield; the world is their battlefield.  Every nation, city and street is considered the battleground by this new enemy, and we were woefully unprepared to fight such an unscrupulous opponent.    We gave every person within our borders extensive rights to privacy and freedom to assemble and voice dissent, and this is how we are repayed.  The freedom that we have given, in hopes that it wouldn't be abused, and in hopes that in light of our obvious goodwill we would be viewed as benevolent and kind, has been used against us.  It would be stupid to send a knight into battle without his armor.  In the same way, we must make ourselves less vulnerable to these sneaky, vicious fiends who wish to use our liberty against us.  If this means a crackdown on the problem groups, so be it.  We have to trust the justice system to do all within its power to find out who is guilty and who is innocent.  The Muslims are proven to produce many terrorists.  The Muslims who aren't terrorists and aren't connected with terrorists might still be apprehended.  They could be tried.  Some may even be wrongly convicted, though I hope not.  They must view it as their duty to the country that, even while investigating its citizens, still allows more freedoms than most other countries would even think of.  Moderate Muslims must do all in their power to distance themselves from terrorism, so that they won't have to worry if they are accused.  It's a two way street; we can try to avoid unjustified arrests, but they have to make it easy to see when the arrests would be justified and when they wouldn't.  The radicals try their hardest to look like moderates, and thus the moderates must try their hardest to prove their innocence.    Terrorism causes trouble all around.  It hurts everyone from those killed in the terrorist action to the Muslims who claim peace but are constantly impersonated, thus making it impossible to tell the difference between the radicals and the moderates.  It sets off false alarms and keeps the population jumpy and on edge, and it circumvents the alarms to strike without warning.  Terrorism is without a doubt a great danger, and one that needs to be eradicated at all costs.    If a crackdown is necessary, I hope the moderates will prove their innocence and dedication to America by putting up with the necessary actions which will keep not only the non-Muslim population safe, but will also the Muslims living peacefully in America safe from terrorism.  Peace through strength is the only way.  The decades-old strategies of appeasement and containment have yielded no results, but peace through strength, the only logical alternative, has proven effective in its role in the downfall of the Soviet Union and the capture of Saddam Hussein.  Peace is great, but we must not shy away from it when it involves making a show of strength and using that strength to put down unruly members of society.  Fear will achieve no peace.  Be blessed, y'all. Neo
