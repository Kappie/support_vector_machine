I hope it came out well on the recording =)   Only a week untill the ASO play the Finale to my Symphony! =D I wandered in there today to hand in the missing 2nd Trumpet part, and the lady at the reception desk had  absolutely no fucking idea  what the hell I was on about with this "student composition run-through" buisness... I don't even think she understood the idea of a composer...  =D
