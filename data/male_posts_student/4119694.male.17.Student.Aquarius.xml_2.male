I got to talk with a good friend I made at the Waterloo Community Playhouse for a while today... that was pretty much the highlight of my day.  I'm in the process of finding a new NFL team I like... not only have the Vikings drafted a former WWE superstar in Brock Lesner, but now rumor has it they are moving to LA in 2007... not cool.  I know Mandy's vote on the matter (the Bears) and Chris' (the Chiefs) and Laura's parents (Packers... *vomit*)... but gimme your ideas :-)  That's about it for me... at least for today.  Hopefully a bunch of us are gonna go see the early show of I, Robot tomorrow... so let me know if you're interested.
