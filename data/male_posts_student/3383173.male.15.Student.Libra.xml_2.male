You who has a name unknown, Your wings, coated pale crimson, My one life I disown, Let me be God’s special pawn.  Reincarnated in me, Not showing yourself clearly, I do wish for this truly, Show us your ferocity.  Your hair colored silver-blue, Eyes filled with a golden hue, Strength? No one has any clue, And mine you will just renew.  I invoke your just mercy, Lend me some strength to complete, My journey towards the sea, And whatever other feat.  Holy strength, pour unto me, So I become death, truly, Guest to all in misery, With blessings from only He.   I’m really sorry. I needed to do it to protect you. But look on the bright side, I’m not suicidal anymore! Although some morbidity will start flowing into me, giving me strength not from this world. By the way, please tell Sese that I’m sorry, and she won’t have to fight me anymore. I’m not bringing my other side out anymore anywhere, since I just completed the chant to intertwine my life with his. The moment I die, he dies as well. But, I’m no longer human. I’m a mix of human and spirit, if you will. You’ll start to hear from my other side at times, but this time I’m controlling him. I won’t make the same mistake any more. I won’t hurt you any more, but I’d rather protect you from myself. Actually, if you wouldn’t get hurt at it, I would have cut all my connections with you, to protect you from me, so as to avoid a happening like my blog post. I’ve stepped off the edge; I’m no longer pure Ryuzuki. My body won’t jerk up anymore, and I got rid off my bloodlust, but now I’m no longer human. Would you be able to accept me being like that? Or will you shun me into exile? I really didn’t know what to do besides this. I’m sorry.  Tyr, if Jon told you or you found out already, please grant my one and only request to you. But don’t tell either Sese or Sakura about this, since they’ll both do something to stop us. That favor is all I ask. By the way, from my other side: I’m sorry that I forgot that part.
