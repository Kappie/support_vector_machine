Woooooooooot :-D. I'm valiently trying to be useful by copying CDs to the network, but all I have to do is put in the disk and wait for 5 minutes while it copies it. Speaking of which, I think its time for a new disk...There we go, I now have 5 more free minutes.  Anydirection, I suppose I should do something useful for anyone who bothers to stumble into my neck of the hundred-terabyte wood of blogs. So:  Use  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  instead of Internet Explorer. Just trust me on this. It's not at all complicated, it automatically blocks all pop-ups, it has tabbed browsing (unbelievably awesome), it's prettier, it's really customizable (I use Gmail and Winamp extensions, a prettyful skin, and a nifty RSS feed), and most importantly IT'S VIRTUALLY IMMUNE TO VIRUSES (unlike the insecure and extremely virus-prone Internet Explorer, which the Computer Emergency Response Team has denounced). Did I mention that it's up to 80% less evil? It's true. There was a study.  Oh, use  urlLink Winamp 5  for all things media. It's worth it just for the visualizations. :-).  Dance instead of walking.  Inventicize wordlings whentime feelsgood.
