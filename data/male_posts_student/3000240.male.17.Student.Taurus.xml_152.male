Well mon ami (quite a fitting phrase for this paragraph at least) apart from it's similar audible qualities, which are true to life and to the eyes from what the very metaphorical travel agent "Susan" said, the seaside town in the south of France is where I will be relaxing, sun bathing and writing some predictable angst ridden articles/poetry/scorn which will hopefully re-juvinate me to my full senses, and a browner shade of skin.    BuBz Diet Update   Going fairly well. It's travelling at a much slower pace than last time but, I feel far more comfortable, and in less need to whitness its effect, so this will definetely be managable for the next few months at least. Next update in the coming days, where I will speed things up, a tad, even for this slowish flab burn( Sexual thoughts are obviously screaming there way through you at this minute I'm sure).  God I miss the old people strangely. I miss the fight of fearing for my mental stability at 8:15am every time I paraded into B2 to *cough - queer* chants, which repetitised (yes word of the day) as the 45 minutes approaching Crosby's large backside waddled itself in between the swingdoor ledged, only for the returning door to give it the much needed whack it needed to make the full transition from hall to classroom. It's the first time I can safely say I've missed that place, in that place I had aggression, an attitude, a moral high ground, and a worthwhile war to fight. Yes, I know; it's hard to win the war, (which in the end I didn't coincidentally as the vast majority of you who read this blog are aware) when it's 49/1 against you, but I loved being the  true  outspoken open minded martyr. I could go on, even more than I am at the moment, but it seems I may have repressed some thing after spending the 6 days sleeping without wake I did, which strangely, many of you like to call a coma, where it SHOULD have been called a mental holiday, to erm, MENTAL FLORIDA! I wish I would have stumbled across the world of blog in say, year 10, not only to have got an A in English the following year, but just for some help, I used to be able to handle a great deal of stress and trauma on my plate with easiness as its middle name, but since year 11, I swell up at the sight of pressure. In many senses what happened there won't ever be repaired completely, but like I stated yesterday, I'm ready to find inner peace, and a fit man to boot, (if I can).   I'm not a strong person. The chance of me being one died last January. So if strength is something I'll never posses in adundance, then maybe dignity, pride, an adequate esteem and a lovely companion for eternity would possibly fill the void? Well something has to or I'll never get anywhere in life.   I don't expect anyone to ever comment on these things, or even read there way through all of it, this "thing" is a self-help system, but just writing about it helps, little by little. There's not much more to say on things in school which I'd like people to have open access to, even my old or newish friends, So I'll just leave you beautiful people pondering what it is,  or  gossiping on what an "attention seeking gossiping queen" I am. Whilst you do that, I shall earn money from Tesco. Ciao  xBuBzx
