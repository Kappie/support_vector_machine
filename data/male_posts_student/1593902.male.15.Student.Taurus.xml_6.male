December 28.2002.   i want her to know that i love her. that i care for her, and that i'll be by her side forever. if anyone ever needs me, just call. i want her to know that i'm sorry. and that i'll try as hard as i can never to harm her. and that i'll make sure she's happy. she's been my one happiest and best thing in 2003. i hope.........she can forgive me and that she knows how much i care for her
