I'm gonna waste time moaning and complaining about dress code violators and then rush through the last two sections of the chapter so we have the test tomorrow. Hell I won't even explain this stuff. I'll read out of the book some of these steps and I'll let you figure it out for yourself. To be nice, I'm going to show you an example of this on the blackboard. Ungrateful kids out of dress code making me go to the board. Sheesh. But here you go all you little brats. And yes I did it wrong because I'm really not a Chemistry teacher. I was really a janitor at the physics lab in Washington or wherever I said I worked and just mugged one of the chemists and stole his lab apron. It was actually me who was responsible for causing a nuclear reaction in the lab and blowing up the entire building, spreading radioactive waste reaching out to a 5 mile radius of the explosion. All because I couldn't add 2 numbers correctly or read directions the way they were meant to be performed. But I'm glad this happened. Because I hate people and I hate children and I hope things return to the way they were in the 70's. Screw all of you. Your test is tomorrow and I hope you know it cause I sure don't. Class dismissed. I have to go get my son out of that tree again."  Listen to H.I.M.
