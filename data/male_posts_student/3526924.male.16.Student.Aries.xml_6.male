"Whether you agreed or disagreed with Ronald Reagan, you can't deny he was honest, fought hard for what he believed in, and had the courage of his convictions. He will be remembered as one of our finer presidents," Schumer said.  Personaly, I think Reagan was right on many things.  People who disagree with me may say he could have brought about WWIII, but he didn't, what he DID bring about was the end to the Cold War.  The Soviets could not compete in the arm's race, and they ended up destroying themselves.
