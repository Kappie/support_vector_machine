Hello and welcome to the Daily Stu (As oposed to the Daily News), a blog site created by my good self, Stuart MacIntosh, a 20 something student from Aberdeen, Scotland. This blog (Or diary) is intended as humour and satire, aimed at promoting free-speech on the net (Oh, I'm not one of those people am I) and the right to say things you might not like, like why I think President George Bush should be sentenced for War crimes and waging an illegal war. As regularly as I can, I shall be logging on here with a view at creating an opinion on news that is unbiased and tells it from all angles. You guys can let me know if I'm doing a good job or not, or even just have a discussion about it. Also, feel free to send me e-mails with stories of your own and I shall post them (Taking Personal credit for them, obviously) if they are funny, or you just want a rant for other people to see. I hope you enjoy this site, don't take it too seriously and happy reading.  Stuart.
