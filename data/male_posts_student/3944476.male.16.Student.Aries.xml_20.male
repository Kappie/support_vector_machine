Today (Tuesday) is the second day of the week that i am late for skool. Honestly speakin, it wasn't my fault that i was late. The fucked up bus came 10 min late. Statistically, this term alone, out of approximately 7 late comings, i managed to escape detention 5 times. In terms of percentage, i managed to escape detention bout 71.5% out of my total late comings. That's one bloody good record.      Out of my many historical escapes, today was the closest one to gettin busted. I was busted before and the consequences were really bad. ( Read ".....")  Okay, today was my another usual day of comin to skool late. I managed to sneak pass the prefect but since i'm a regular late comer, i guessed that the prefect's startin to figure out my dirty little tactics. At first, I was like YAY! but the son of a bitch Sydney Tan was makin people run around the track again ... (Read "Skool's Weird ") Bloody shithead. Then, while i was about to run aroound the track, i saw the prefect walkin towards My Sydney and they started talkin (prolly complainin bout me) , so i started to run faster, hopin to get away from him. Bleah, then after finished runnin around the track, i heard Mr Sydney Tan callin another dude, while the prefect was gone. He then accused the poor dude for runnin away from the prefect. Haha. Guessed that he scolded the wrong person. Then, i reacted instinctively by taking my bag and runnin back to class. Lol.
