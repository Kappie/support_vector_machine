It's not steadfast progress on a goal, but I'm moving forward with a lot of work, and it's better writing than if I were forced to work on one idea right now.    The key for my film career is not to get caught up in the idea that I'm getting old and I need things to happen now.  I'm 24.  I won't be 25 for almost half a year.  At 20, I always said that I'd follow my dreams until I was 30, and then I'd worry about the real world.  An easy statement to make when my life revolved around Youree Drive and Brown Chapel in Shreveport, but not wholly ignorant.    Waiting is difficult, because it gets in the way of acting.  Impatience is grown in this country, especially with the mechanisms of convenience we utilize each minute.  Daryl's bemoaning a girl's inability to call him back after 90 minutes is a prime example; were I starting something with a person who was now abroad 30 years ago, I'd have to wait at least two weeks to find out if what I wrote was met with adulation or reluctance.  Now, 90 minutes is considered too long a window.    I lost an acquanitance a few weeks ago, based on honest comments regarding his writing ability.  Truth be told, he wasn't any good, and it was quite unlikely that he ever would be.  It was nothing personal, but part of me wishes I had not scoured the piece as soon as he had passed it my way...I did try to sound positive at the end of the comments, but he got honesty that he probably didn't expect, even though he asked for it.  The work was unsolicited, and very "huggy," a Centenary euphamism denoting the want of a rah-rah attitude for effort, forgetting that talent is also a reqiurement for good work.  I get bothered by unsolicited writing; it comes fairly often, always from weak writers, who expect me to shower them with kind words and justify that their professor was wrong in whatever grade was bestowed.    Anyway, as soon as I saw who it was and that there was an attachment, I was bothered.  Though, to my credit, I took a deep breath and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt on the piece, which at first instinct I assumed would royally suck.  I waited for that to pass, and then started reading.  Couldn't get past page 10, wish I hadn't started.    Regardless of how I play off what I did as right (he needed honest criticism; better to learn he can't do it now than later), I can't help but feel like I broke a spirit there.  I just can't think how I would do it differently.  And that bothers me.
