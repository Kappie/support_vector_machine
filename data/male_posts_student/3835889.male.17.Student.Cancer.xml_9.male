Although this is my first driving lesson, i had already started driving on the road...Guess why? Hahaxz its bcause the driving lessons here in US starts on any road, particularly anywhere. Unlike Spore, driving can only be learned in a driving school...and so unlimited..     It all started in the residential area, where the traffic is v light. The instructor taught me to accelerate and many other things which includes using the brakes, the mirrors etc etc...Me n my mum learnt together and i started to lose control when i first drove...nearly went head on into a bush...hahaxz i was slightly nervous mahxz no choice. But everything went on smoothly after that...then it was my Mum's turn...she almost rammed into a dustbin! Lolxz but no choice mahxz all beginner. However when the lesson was over, the instructor offered me to drive him and my mum home! I was kinda surprise but still went ahead. This was also the first time which i went into a heavy traffic which was kinda like a route which many ppl used...and boy was i glad that i made it home *phew...* Lolxz...I parked the car (anyhow) after that....It was damn interesting man...
