I feel like every post should be about something important, so if there isn't anything major happening, I don't post anything.   I guess I don't have to stress so much, and I can just post about whatever I'm feeling, or whatever minor event is the catastrophe of the day.  It seems to me that when I was a teenager, and writing a daily journal, I never had a shortage of earth-shaking and life or death situations to write about. Of course, when I look back at the entries now, somehow they aren't so life or death. I can even laugh about some of them now, things that I thought at the time were the end of the world.  I guess that perspective changes. Often when I'm at work, talking to people there (being in a supermarket most of the staff are students), they will be talking about the huge problems in their lives, things like who is dating who, what movies are on, or how they afford new jeans  and  top up their cellphone! I have at times said to them that they don't know what problems are.   Talking to a classmate last year, at the height of all the stresses in my life, she said that my situation made her problems seem insignificant. In some ways I agreed, but I also said that when we are in the middle of a situation, whatever it may be, to us it is the most important thing, and to say that someone else's problems are insignificant is to belittle their concerns.  This is why my issues of teenage angst, the financial concerns of my co-workers, and the heavier issues of my day to day life, are all important. Although to someone outside the situation it may seem trivial, when you are in the centre of something, it can be overwhelming.  So when people, especially youth group people, talk to me about what is going on in their lives, I try to look at it from their perspective. I try to put myself in their place, to understand what they are going through. In some ways all the stuff that I have been through has made that an easier ask, because I actually  have  been there!  Perspective is important, viewing issues from the point of view of someone else, and helping them to see it from another angle, maybe so it doesn't seem so big
