To think I had zero period in high school. 7 AM every morning!  I went to sleep around 2 AM and woke up around 7 AM... went to McDonald's before work to pick up a Sausage Egg McMuffin since I was starving (staying up does that to you). I made it through another 6 hr shift... it was exhausting. Now I'm here online, feeling kind of out it from having a bunch of coffee and donuts at work. Yes I know I promised to be healthy...  According to my counter... people actually read this thing. Or I left my counter on the wrestling picture archive on Geocities and 200+ have hit it within the past 12-ish hours.  Who the hell is reading this bessides Mike? Post on my guestbook if you read this thing or IM me.   Oh yea... and I didn't get any writing done yesterday. I really need to fucking get shit done today.  **
