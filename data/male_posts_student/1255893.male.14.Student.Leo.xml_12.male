I know I can just as easily write a poem or sing a song to show how I feel, but instead of thinking of one of those things, I'm going to just blurt stuff out:  I've been going to bowling club after school every thursday for the entire year now. At first it was just for fun, I think that is what won us the first place trophy(go team 15). Now it's just to get away from the tention of school and home. It's not like I have a lot of crap going on, It's just that I have nowhere else to talk about what DOES go on around me. Now I seem to be bowling backward games. I start w/ strikes and the next frame only gets me gutter balls. I truly believe that this stems from what I have stated above. My stress test has revealed that I only have an 8% stress level. Yet I sometimes feel like ripping my hair out, super glueing it back on, and starting the whole scalp deminishing process again. So there must be some other form of stress or another thing that's hurting my brain and causing me to need this little box to talk to.
