My eyes are closed and I can not see what I type - I shucked my contact lenses hours ago. I'm typing slowly so as to make as few errors as possible. I'm rather exhausted, I think that the past few days have been more than what I really could bear, at least as far as a biological standpoint could account for.  When asked how my day was, I responded "Hiroshima". When contemplating how my evening is going to be, I think "Nagasaki". It's been truly disasterous in an epic sort of way.  There have brilliant glimmering points of light that have pierced the fallout. I believe my current worldview, my mindstate is being dictated entirely by the lack of sleep that has been thrust upon me. As I'm sitting here worlds like foible, lycanthrope and fois gras slide across my brain.  Exhaustion is quite overrated, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
