On sunday i went to BDB i dragged Sadia along with me because i didnt want to go alone but it ended up being fine. We did some warm-ups at first then as he was auditioning people we had sectionals and the bari section marched and played and we all got in a circle and i got to know everyone and everyone there is really cool. But right after that i had a concert.        martin luther king service       everyone loved us         catholic, jewish, and baptist all in one room       crazy man  that seems to be the overview of my night it was a good service i must say  today Chamber Choir recorded a cd, it was so tedious and long but itll probably be worth it in the end. Plus we took a break and in that break i learned how to do a running round off back hand spring. I got home and tried to do it and it wouldnt work but ill try it again tommorow when im not aching. well g'night
