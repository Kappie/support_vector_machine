Makes me want to hit the fuckin'  nit picky bitch in the mouth.  This woman, my TA, is a cute, smiling little ex sorority girl which while good to sleep with is no one you want in charge of your grade.  She doesn't explain things and then hates confrontation.  When asked questions about the assignment she will respond with answers like everyones will be different, there is no wrong way to do this assignment all you have to do is complete it.  So you think awesome, go home and do it and then bring it to her before class and ask, "Is this what you wanted."  and she replies "Yes, Perfect."  Then you get it back and you get a C.  What a dumb bitch.  This is happening to everyone in my class and I want to fucking yell at her and hit her in the goddamn mouth.  I want to hit a bunch of women in the mouth but that is just a common thing with me hating women.  But I restrain myself and am nice to them 90% of the time unless I'm drunk and then I tell them how I really feel about them being fat and worth nothing unless they are on their knees.  God I'm a nice person..  Well I'm off to do some more of this bullshit and scream a little bit about i  Fuck the World
