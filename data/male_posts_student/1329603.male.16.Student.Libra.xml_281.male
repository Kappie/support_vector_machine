The only real difference is that they only let 2 of us go for lunch (being the gentleman I am I let the 2 younger guys go) and then let me go an hour later. Lame. I dunno, it wasn't such a good day.  Got back to find I had 6 emails (2 are from the telegraph so they don't count), and... the other 4 are all about NJAN's recording possibilities in August. 3 were from Tom, and 1 from a studio in Cheltenham that Tobin recommended. I dunno, that one seems cool.  I'm really tired, and I've gotta go to Winchcombe tonight. Bleh.  Quote of the day: "Got a silly little girl, she's all on my mind, No doubt about it, she looks so fine. She's the best girl that I ever had, So don't you go and make me feel so bad."  From Deep Purple's   Hush   Love, Jon Roskilly
