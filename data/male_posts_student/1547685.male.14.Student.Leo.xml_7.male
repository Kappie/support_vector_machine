In AH we watched a video on jackie robinson, which was kinda kewl but i couldnt stay awake. In math we watched a lame video on mazes. I mean come on atleast if we were going to watch something to waste time then we should of watched Finding Nemo. Who really even cares about mazes!??? Then i had lunch in the gym where i almost got pegged in the head by a flying ball. Luckily i was paying attention and moved just before i caught it with my eye... In spanish we played a game which was okay considering i had some of the dumbest ppl on my team and they were all lazy. We got blown out and the only point we got was by the dumbest guy in our class. I was like whoa...... After that i came home and now im sitting here writing about my boreing day.
