Anyway, another RoTHE update, I've added sounds, and I've basically worked out the weapons. You can shoot now. Anyways, I'll start programming new levels and adding background music.  I'm going off for some piano practice, I'll update a bit later after I go get some hot chips and an hour of solid piano practice. I've got piano exams in novemember.  I'll be back.  Colin
