In the case of MLB you have to spend money to make championships.  The following stats are Winning % divided by millions spent for 2004.  Teams want to have a higher WPPM, but as you will see, teams that are not willing to be bargain hunters will probably wind up playing in October.  Current Standings:  NL Central  WPPM    Cardinals    7.7 Cubs         5.9 Reds        12.4 Brewers     18.7  Astros       6.8 Pirates     11.3  NL East     WPPM Phillies     5.7 Braves       5.8 Marlins     12.2 Mets         5.3 Expos        8.3  NL West     WPPM Dodgers      6.2 Giants       6.7 Padres       8.3 Rockies      6.0 DBacks       5.0  AL Central  WPPM White Sox    8.1 Twins       10.0 Indians     13.8 Tigers       9.7 Royals       7.6  AL East     WPPM Yankees      3.5 Red Sox      4.7 DRays       16.7 Blue Jays    8.7 Orioles      9.2  AL West     WPPM Rangers      9.7 Athletics    9.1 Angels       5.3 Mariners     4.8        So where does a team draw the line?  The Yankees spend more than anyone, but they're winning.  Cardinals are doing great at 7.7 and have the 2nd best record in baseball.  The Twins are only 2 games out.  They're WPPM is much higher than their division rival ChiSox.  Are the Twins' owners willing to drop their WPPM so as to increase the one stat that does matter PCT?  Question for Walt Jockety:  Are you willing to decrease the WPPM just a little bit in order to help shore up a vulnerable rotation? -CJ
