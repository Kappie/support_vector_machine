Especially with people who you know wont even listen to what you have to say! I need to just think in my head more and not outside my head outloud. More contemplation, less aggravation is my new motto.  Work was great. Paul and Barbara helped me figure out that my hard drive on my new PC was shit and I got a semi-new one from Matt. He kinda owed me anyways for his dog eating my face!   I have a art project and a few English papers I must get done this weekend.....Preferably!!!!   Ice in my vains, chills up my spine, I am in a mood again.
