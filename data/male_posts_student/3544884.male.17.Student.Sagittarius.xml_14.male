And Lety one of the girls that went with us got all mad and we lost her so she was by herself for like i don't know, 4 hours or more. Then like later everything got worst when Candice's mom was looking for her, and like she wasn't not supposed to be with us, something i didn't knew but i understood really fast beacuse i know how her mom is. Well she was thinking of running away and like i offered her my house but we didn't knew what was going on since we were still in six flags and we weren't answering any phone calls but Candice's sister wich was in a friend's house also without permission. So like at 10:10 we called a cab since we didn't find a ride home. We stop in a ATM becuase we didnt hace but $20 and it wasn't wnough money to get to my house and get the van so i could pickup Bianca, Candice's sister, and drop off Susan and tamarindo later. Well we dropped off Susan and later we picked up Bianca and convinced her to go to her house  but we dropped her like to houseas down of hers, appearantely they saw the van so i think that got me a little in trouble later.After that tamarindo, Candice and I were going to my house, but i saw my mom in the living room and it was weird cause well she was like waiting for me, so i told them "let's go to mayras house" which is really close to my house so there we went and i called my dad just to tell him we found a ride home and that i was at mayras house and he sounded all mad and he told me that the police was looking for Candice and stuff. So we all got in some sort of trouble but peptio later picked up Candice at mayras house so when the police called my house i gave them info about pepito and they later went to his house. Candice later called me but she didn't tell me where she was but i guessed she was at Lety's cause i heard her voice. I don' what happend in between but later Susan parent came to my house and told me that they didn't want me to have anything to do with their daughter so i was all sad, but still i will se her at school =P. The last call i received that day was from Susan to tell me that Candice was already at her house, then i fall asleep.
