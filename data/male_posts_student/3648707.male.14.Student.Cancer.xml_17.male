IF YOU WERE NOT NAMED, THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME UNTIL I GET A CHANCE TO CALM DOWN, CUZ WHEN I BLOW, I GARUNTEE THAT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT, I WILL BE THROWIN INSULTS AND STUFF, THINGS THAT I DONT MEAN, AND ONLY THOSE FOUR PPL KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT I DONT MEAN IT AND THAT I AM JUST GETTIN SOME STEAM OFF. thank you for reading my blog, im out for now, hit up my cell if you wanna talk.
