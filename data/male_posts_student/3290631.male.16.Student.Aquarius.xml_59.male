I felt like calling my mom and telling her to tell the school to let me go home but I decided to stay for it.  I'm looking forward to my summer--though I guess it hasn't started in full-effect yet since I still have to take my chemistry regents next Wednesday.  After that, my summer would have started for sure.  I took the global history regents today.  It was very easy, and I wouldn't be surprised if I pulled off a perfect score--but I probably didn't.  I prepared for the test by taking three old global history regents yesterday and taking a bunch of practice questions on a regents prep website.  I also went downtown and bought myself a barrons chemistry book with old regents in it to prepare for next Wednesday's test.  Maybe I'll get some work done on my next wallpaper tomorrow.  A bunch of it is done, I just need to incorporate some more effects and stuff.
