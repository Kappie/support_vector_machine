So she cried...        and cried...                        and cried...        She cried until her crying could probably be used as a frickin carrier wave    for UHF signals...        *sigh*        Twas  not  a good day for my ears...     I  did find out the extent of Uncles driving skills though,      It was actually quite comforting...      Well "comforting" meaning       "I-know-when-we-hit-something-at-this-speed-I-won't-feel-a-thing..."      Go figure...       Hmm tired, going to go sleep now...        Miss Emma... :(        Meh...
