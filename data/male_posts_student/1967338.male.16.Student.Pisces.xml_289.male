I'M QUOTING! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATE PEOPLE DO! DON'T HURT ME!  "Kevin wheels into the kitchen, where the rest of the family is getting breakfast, reading the newspaper on his lap aloud to all: "'Chief Girardi's courage in confronting the corruption that has plagued Arcadia for years cannot be underestimated. He should be treated as a hero, not a pariah.'" Joan finds this odd and asks, "One of those flesh-eating Amazonian death fish?" Luke: "That's 'piranha.' A 'pariah' is an outcast, one of the unclean."" -Deborah on  Joan of Arcadia  1.12, "Jump"  Click this  urlLink link . Fufill your true nature.  Joan of Arcadia airs Friday at 8 on CBS.
