Hope all of you who read this post will enjoy the jokes and story that i have written.            Well, i start on with the announcement of the PSLE results. The day that i got my results, i was very devastated by the fact that i scored lower than my mid years and prelims. I actually got 251 during mid year but dropped to 240 in my prelims though i still topped my class with another girl and got my trip to Malacca for being the top in my class. But i got 237 for my PSLE. I cried when i got my results. Most of my classmates also cried. The atmosphere in my class was very sad that day even though some scored quite well. I got into my third choice which is The jews were in the wrong -Jurong. My first choice was the wealth is too common - Commonwealth and my second choice is the cottage in swiss - Swiss Cottage. But i didn't get in due to my poor results.            Thus that's marked the end of my primary school life and marked the beginning of my secondary school life. Lots of memories were usually remembered by most students on the first day of school because they usually were engraved deep into our minds and often were brought in in our conversations when we have class gatherings.       I felt very awkward for the fact that it was my first time wearing a tuck out uniform. I was wondering if iwas supposed to tucked my uniform in or whatsoever. Do u believed that i actually tucked my uniform in!? But found it weirdso i tucked out again. Hahahaha.... when i reached school i saw that most students had their uniform tucked out soothed my awkwardness. I found a new friend soon after my form teacher arranged our seats. She left a very deep impression of herself in me because she took the initiative to introduce herslf to me. Can u believe that a girl actually did that? I was taken surprised by her act but webecamevery good friends then. I made a lot of very good friends in my class like Candy(e girl whu intro herself to me), wendy liew(blur sotong), Irenes(one pile pile of shit), Kareen(the curry urn), Wanwei(elephant), Wen jie(pig), Qing Lin(cheng Teng), Caiyan(jelly), Cai Ping(apple jie), Gang Yi(Boss), Kang Wei(underwear Wei), Jing Boon(baboon, san chun jing lian), and many many others.           Of cos, every class pupils will have themselves painted as the black sheep of the class (hey i had ans Andrew's questions). Naughty pupils of cos, mostly being influenced by the bad people whom were initially bad. They were really brought down the reputation of our class and created a lot of problems but i think that they had learnt their lessons now for their acts they had done at that time. But i was really lucky to have so many kind, caring and responsible teachers through my primary school as well as my sec. sch. Ms Zoey Oh, my sec 1 form teacher and the bubbly cute teacher i had in my sec 2, Ms Jasmine Owyong (a really very nice teacher), love her so much. We had a guinea pig called rambo during sec 2 but died after a few months in the month of the june holidays. We cried and buried it near the eco pond in our school. It died on the way to the vet in a taxi. The vet said it was infected by germs in its stomach. It was a sad day for my class 2/4.
