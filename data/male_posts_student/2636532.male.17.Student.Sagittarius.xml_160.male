Salsa is not meant to have corn in it. I don't care if it's southwestern style or Corny McCorncorn's special corn blend, salsa should NEVER have corn in it.  2. When people move, the house should have averything already in it. and i mean everything, there's ntohing i hate more tehn trying to fit a freaking couch through a door that it wasn't meant to fit through and then try to manuever it up a flight of stairs.  3. Ants should never build nests where it's in the way. Ant nests just should never be where some person may want to go at some point in time. they should have to be in the middle of nowhere and not somewhere where you can run it over with a lawnmower.  4. Milk should change color when it goes bad. just think about it...then how often would you accidently drink a glass of bad milk if it was red when it wasn't good anymore?  these are just some random things that i think should happen...just because -matt
