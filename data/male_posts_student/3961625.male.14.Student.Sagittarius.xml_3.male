This is a place that still has 20,000 kilograms of unexploded bombs and grenades in the ground. It was completely destroyed by German bombing raids during WWI (and when I say completely, I mean completely. I have pictures of pictures) and was rebuilt. We took about an hour to drive there and when we got there we parked outside of the tall defensive walls, climbed over and through said walls, and finally came to a massive gate which must have listed at least 500,000 names, all of which had dissapeared and who´s bodies had never been found. Then we walked through the cathedral, which was beautiful, and then we ate lunch at a place called  Vivaldi  right on the main square. (I had "Penne the Italian way") We then went into the Flanders field museum, which is an interesting if somewhat gruesome museum about all the fighting in Flanders during WWI. They gave us little cards with names of soldiers on them, and throughout the exhibit, we placed the cards in little scanners, 4 in total, and it told us the story in 4 parts. My first guy died. Idiot. The second guy got caught and was incinerated somewhere in Western Germany. Oh well. We then went back to the car and took a quick ride to a part of the land around Ieper where the trenches from WWI were still intact. Now I know why war is hell. they were dark, gloomy, and very, very muddy. Besides, there were bomb craters all around us, and the guide seemed intent on telling us every minute or two how many unexploded bombs there were per square meter in the area around us. We then went back to the seaside (1 hrs. drive) and picked up the boys. We had a drink at a little pub, then went back home to Nancy´s. There we put the kids to bed, and Steven and I picked up some fries and sausages at the 5th Frituur we came to (all the rest were shut, as it was 9:30 at night). After dinner we tooke the dog on a walk and played MONOPOLY. I won.
