Lets first talk about T.V.  One of the shows that I admired most was  urlLink Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.   This aired on  urlLink YTV  about 2 - 3 years ago.  At the time that i started watching it, it aired at around 9 pm, right after the  urlLink DBZ  block.  I guess not many people were watching it, so they moved it to air around 2 am.  I had thought they canceled it, untill i looked in the TV guide.  Unfortunately, it was canceled just after they had aired the whole series.  This show, in my opinion, was about 200 times better than DBZ could ever be.  It was projected towards an older audience, due to the subjects that were discussed throughout the series, even thought it was a 'giant robot' cartoon.  It had subjects like love, peace, respect, and all sorts of things that were great in it, not to mention really cool giant robots, and amazing animation.  But DBZ got the vote for that time slot, and now 'Wing' is off the air.    On a much more serious note, one of the things that is most overlooked is the  urlLink Bible .  The MOST important book in all of liturature.  It has an answer to every question, a solution to ever problem, including death.  Most people just look past it, thinking it is just 'religious mumbo-jumbo'.  They are wrong about that in every way.  urlLink  Beyond Good and Evil  is a very good game in my opinion.  It has a good method of story telling, has good character development, has good graphics, has good voices, has good gameplay, and has good music.  These are all the things that make a game great, but i found it for $14.98 in the bargain bin.  Why is this?  Because all great things are left unnoticed.  Lets hope that when another great thing is revealed, people will take note of this.    Lates
