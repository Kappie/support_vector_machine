But let me tell you right now, It's really friggen cold, and we have yet to turn on the heater, which will be done sunday, so it can be swimable for monday. Then I mowed Steve's lawn, and went to Evan's house, but ended up going back here.  Went to senate this morning, and got some eggs with bacon and some tasy hash browns.  Evan was there too, and he always spends a million dollars and eats practically nothing >_  Why is the title "Science Fiction and Me" you may be asking (or not)?  Well, I have to still do my whole final for Sci-Fi, and I also have to read the rest of Childhood's End, which is like 9 chapters by monday, so this will not be fun at all. The book IS good, but it still is boring to read on a weekend.  Don't know whats going on today. Guitar Center with Phil, Evan, and Brian maybe. Most likely practice. Call if your bored or something.  mur
