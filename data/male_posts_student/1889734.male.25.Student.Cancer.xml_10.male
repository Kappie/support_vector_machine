Funny how the left wails and cries about our involvement in the Middle East, while at the same time standing in the way of severing our dependence on this part of the world.  They won't let us extract the oil present in this country, so we must continue to buy from foreign suppliers.  They won't let us persue nuclear power as a viable alternative, forcing us to burn the dreaded fossil fuels.  The advocate matchbox cars that couldn't get a ticket in a school zone, and then act shocked when no one wants to buy them.    Energy is the engine of freedom.  Conservation is not going to save us.  Renewable sources are a noble thing to pursue, but right now we need our own sources of power.  Start drilling!  Sever our dependence on OPEC.  Let the middle east dry up and return to the desert.
