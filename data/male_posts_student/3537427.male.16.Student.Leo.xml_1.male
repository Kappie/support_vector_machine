Its Friday, I may have to work tomorrow, how am I gonna know? This is why you don't want a job till you turn 35 kids. Well I guess I'll go back later and see if they have it. If they don't, I'm not workin tomorrow.And thats that. As for now Im gonna go find interestingly creative ways to spend my $89.46 ( I know, its not much, but I only worked 18.6 hours.)
