My exhuberence for tonight is fueled by feeling good and drinking beer, but as I try and be analyitical, here's my perspective.  The Marlins series will not be easy, but definately doable...  Looking to the AL, if the Sox can win tomorrow (HOPE THEY DO), it will be Boston vs. New York and I hope those pinstriped mfs go down in flames setting up a Cubs Sox World Series, a true Cubs Sox WS, none of this White Sox crap.  The only thing that soured this night slightly was the fact that some complete rag decided to bring in the "Go Cubs Go" song and they played it every damn commercial break starting in the 4th or 5th inning.  And it didn't just play during the breaks, it frequently ran into the game itself and was particularly annoying during that whole "did Kenny catch the ball sequence."  Cause it was necessary to hear the song for the 47th time in a row.  But the important thing is the Cubs won.  And for you Sammy supporters out there, look at the stats: -one more strikeout than hit in this series -a sparkling ave. of .188 -besides making the grab in the 9th tonight, the best thing he did was  not  swing and take walks.  And pretend he could steal bases.  Remember that attempt for 2nd base earlier in the series.  I don't think the Cubs could figure out a way to spend $16.8 million any better  Beisbol beisbol beisbol besibol swing beisbol
