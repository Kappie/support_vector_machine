I had a while on the trip home for introspection.  I realized (or at least now believe) that it is not the passing of time itself that makes one older, but rather the events that occur with the passing of time that change us.  I am probably not the first to have this revelation but it was at least original to me.  I had a lot of major trials this weekend. A few I passed.  Many I failed.  I have learned from all of them though.  Where I will go depends on if I apply what I learned.
