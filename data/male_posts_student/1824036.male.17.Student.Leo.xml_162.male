First, my dad came in and said there was a 2 hour delay for school due to bad weather (fog). That was the one good thing about today. P.E. always makes me mad just cuz its unfair. Coach Ras is a moron and I greatly dislike her. She is biased towards her volleyball players and the people who kiss her butt 24/7 ( a.k.a.  people who drink everyweekend)  Fifth period, I go in to realize I had left my trumpet out the day before. Could people leave my stuff alone...OF COURSE NOT. WHY THE FUCK SHOULD THEY!!! Jeez my stuff was all over the place. All my music had been stolen. My valve oil was stolen, and even my mute had its last cork busted a little. People just tend to piss me off. That means that at the pep assembly I didn't play. I was too pissed about my trumpet. Instead I shouted insults at everyone (cheerleaders who are mostly kinda skaggy, and then a few teachers here or there). I was pretty much asking for it the whole day.  Today I just wanted to go on a rampage and beat everyone up. It wasn't a good day...
