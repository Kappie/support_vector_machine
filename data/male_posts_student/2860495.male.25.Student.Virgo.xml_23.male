I think that Kerry is best man for the job that is still running.  I'm liberal, so that shouldn't surprise anybody.  While I don't disagree with Bush on many things, I don't think that he is evil.  I don't think that he's all that bright or skilled either.  In my opinion, he's trying to do what he thinks is best for America and the world and none of the negative consequences of his actions ever even occur to him.  I miss the days of reasonable people disagreeing about the proper course of action and that not only being okay, but being the preferred way.  They point of politics would seem to be to get groups with a common goal yet different views on how to achieve said goal.  In this arrangement there would be dialogue and a give and take.  That doesn't seem to happen.  While we, the people, seem to seek some common ground, our representatives seem to seek out opportunities to thwart the democratic process.  (Again, while I like to think of Bush as not evil, I'm very tempted to throw that label at Tom Delay).  I, like many people, went to see the new Michael Moore movie this past weekend.  Sure, it is an effective piece of propaganda, but it seems to be another example of accusing a group of being evil because they disagree with you.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe the left needs someone like Moore so that we get motivated to act.  Maybe he is supposed to serve much the same purpose as Rush Limbaugh does for the right.  I don't know.  I never found Limbaugh to be terribly helpful for the state of things.  Anyway, I'm torn.  I find Moore's books entertaining and at least in my little world, he's nothing more than a rabble rouser who's not to be taken entirely seriously.  I find myself distressed when people afford him the same respect and reverance that they afford to legitamate thinkers and political leaders.  If W is a fake man of the people, then what of the millionaire Moore.  What's more of the multimillionaire fraud that is Ralph Nader.  I don't want to talk about Ralph Nader though, because for all of his ego, Moore seems to care much more about the collective good than Nader ever could.  I don't know.
