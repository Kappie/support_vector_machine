As usual, got mixed up again while trying to sort out some things in my mind.   Didnt expect anything special to happen while in school today, but during recess time, when I just walked out of the classroom, Mr Denis Koh, our DM, saw me and signalled me to go over. I was thinking, hell, I didnt pull off any stunts these days wad... why he wanna see me for ? My doubts were cleared when he just patted me on my back and said 'how are you?' Became kinda surprised and glad that someone did notice my existence... lol~.. I replied that i was okay, not too bad, but feeling down lately (as this blog mentions)... So he asked why and well, it kinda became a personal talk in a corner, then when people were walking by, they all had the same idea that I've stepped on his tail.. the kind of stare they gave me... just felt so funny.. well but it wasnt unusual la, expected de.. so.. just like that lor.. Told him some personal stuffs, and he, too shared his stuff with me too.. and I felt that my talk with him wasnt so important, so much so he shoved off all the students that had to meet him, and just dismissed them, without giving them a piece of his mind.. I'm the saviour i guess... lol~ Yeah, so I might look up the DM or VP (they are a couple FYI) these days... didnt really seem to have anyone who had a listening ear le... is there ? Did I miss out anyone ?   Went to Sherman's house after that, took Jarael's hp to go trade in.. guess what ? Out of stock still.. and the price for the T630 still cant be lowered, and out of fun, I queried a Nokia 6230 cover, the guy said $45, but i already located one shop that sold it at $38... peculiar, seems to me they aint doing proper business...undermining some stuff maybe ? Hate this...  So, kinda decided on the vendor i'm gonna get my T630 from,Whymobile is the one. Calling them up at 9.15 am tomorrow, and get a delivery to my door beforeI head out to meet my friends to go out... At least got some time to test it out.. haha.. hopefully got discount, since I'm a repeat customer...Went home after that...   Then, didnt really expect this, but, BUT,I still went out, this time to Atrium, to play some ID with Kun Long. I successfully broke Steve's record of 2'47'446 on the 86 Trueno... Got it down to 2'47'162, but felt very happy with it le... i dont really expect a top form, since I'm just beginning to stand up again.. mood is still sad and bottled up, althoughI did let out some today.. to the DM.. he behavedlike a real friend to me.. not like his fierce usual self...  Went up to PS to eat dinner, and then headed down to Kovan to get some stuffs.. deodorant for Kun Long,facial wash for me... Neutrogena ? KL said it was kinda good, so I decided to give it a try... den headed to Comics Connection, bought a keychain (only at 50 cents, kinda cheap)and aNissan GTR R34 1/61 model by Tomy.. will take a pic with the T630 tomorrow, hehe... my 6230 cant focus, or rather, capture it that clearly... its only good for far shots.... so .. yeah, thats about it... Time we went home was 9... so, took a bath, and here I am, blogging this for the day events... Kinda happy today lor, andthat's pretty much about it lor...   T630, here I come !! :D
