I'm really for moving here, even though I had an encounter with the moody folk of Atlanta, which really put me off to begin with, but I'm begining to warm with the states at last.  Not that much is different, well apart from the fact:  It's legal to carry knives There is no TV 'Watershed' Woo Hoo! Everything is big and spaced out There's no local supermarket or cornershop, just big stores u can drive a couple of miles to Great weather Snakes, scorpions... the lot  Still pondering on what to do about school, I'll have to think about that a lot.  Anyways, past my bed time now... cya
