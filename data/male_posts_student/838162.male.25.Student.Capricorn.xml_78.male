I really love the latest run of local newspaper columnists recently. Yet another thought-provoking article in the Life! Section last Tuesday. Speaks on a topic close to my heart. I know it is once again about relationships and talking about that can get old very fast. Heck even I’m sick of talking about it, but beats all the computer stuff that no one else cares to read or understand here right?  The said article talks about the Columnist’s experience and reason for wanting to remain friends with her ex boyfriend and she talks about why would she want to, why it’s something that more people should do and the obstacles she had to overcome. Now I would love to reprint the whole article here, but since I don’t have permission, I shall have to resort to just highlighting certain points that she made that I agree with and summarize it.  The writer notes that it is not easy going and requires “maturity, patience and several misfires”. She recalls that it was difficult when her ex had to run off on a date during an outing with mutual friends, how a hug or a pat on the shoulder can bring back painful memories but they “peter out over time”. But even with all this she carries on, in part due to the idea that past relationships help make one become stronger as a person and as an individual. Over advantages she notes includes being able to quiz him about what she did wrong so that she won’t make the same mistakes next time and how he can be used as a “pseudo Gay Boyfriend” in which with all the sexual tension over with, they can just “hang out without feeling self-conscious”. Lastly she muses over how her ex and she now swap testimonials on  urlLink Friendster.com  and that he remembers her birthday and sends flowers. She feels that they are more “saner” as friends and that everyone deserves a second chance.  I’m quite glad to see good writers on the payroll of my local newspaper. It’s good to see them being able to stretch their talents and speak on personal experiences as well. I’ve always had firm respect for journalist and this just reinforces it. Of course not everyone can be a Dave Barry, who is more humor based then anything, so it’s good to have a good balance of insight as well as whim.
