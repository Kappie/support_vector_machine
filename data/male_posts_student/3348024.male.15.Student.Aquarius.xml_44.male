But some lawmakers in California recently tried to push the voting age there even lower. The measure is called Training Wheels for Citizenship. It would give 16- and 17-year-olds one-half of a vote. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds would get one-quarter of a vote. Do you think that proposal is a good idea?"  Don't we already have enough ignorance in the system?  Honestly, this is terrible... I think we should raise the voting age to...  People who have an idea of what's going on and won't be swept up by jackasses like John Kerry and George Bush...  Which reminds me... It's been a while since we've had a good president.  I think FDR was the last good one.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA... ya, I know that wasn't funny.  I thought it had potential though.   "Impress your friends: Talk all about Thomas Jefferson"  Is that all it takes to impress third graders now?  Back when I was in third grade, it was the kid with the biggest dick or something stupid like that.   "Week of June 1, 2004     Which recent president do you most respect?  President George W. Bush  President Bill Clinton  None of the above      Click here to see results."   Honestly, is there anything to respect in either of them?    Here's the k-2 poll.  All I can say is LMFAO  "Where Should the President Eat? Traveling all over the United States can make a president hungry. Which place do you think he should eat at the most?   Week of June 1, 2004     When traveling around the country, which place should the president eat at the most?  at fancy restaurants because he has plenty of money  at fast food restaurants because he is so busy  in his room at his hotel because he can wear pajamas           "When the president travels around the country, which of these places should he defintely visit?  schools, so he can see how much kids are learning  hospitals, so he can see how people are cared for  government building, so he can see how towns and cities are run            See the results without voting"  Honestly, what's the point?  Where the fuck is the punch line?
