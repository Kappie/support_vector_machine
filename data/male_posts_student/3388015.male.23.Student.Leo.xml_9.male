My mother came to town and we went to Peligrinos for lunch.  We both got chili.  Now you know where I get it from, right?  We talked about a wide range of topics, plus the great dinner we had with Cindy the other night. Plus, she showed me the article in the paper about how she saved that dog.  "Now remember, it's a small dog." you read my mom saying.  She instructed him on doing the heimlich. "Is he okay? I think he's okay, he's biting us now." the guy onthe other line responds.  I had fun with mom, for sure.  She went and donated blood.  Later, I did take a moment to find a great deal on a cell phone on ebay.  It comes with a bunch of cool stuff AND the cable to hook my laptop up to it to use as a modem.  That's great, seeing how I can connect to the net now with my new knowledge.   urlLink     It's a Motorola.  And if I don't like it, I can turn around and sell it or give it as a gift to someone.  Cindy and I are off to her room, apparently, ResLife yelled at her for not cleaning it.  So we'll go clean, then we'll hang, then I'm going home for one night this week and just veg.
