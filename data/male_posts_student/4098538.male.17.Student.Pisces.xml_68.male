I'm gonna add a page tomorrow about Mandy's alter-ego, 'Monster Mandy'. Should be pretty fun. I've been playing pool on Yahoo! quite a lot lately. I don't really have much else to do with my time other than play guitar. Which reminds me - I learned some new songs. I learned a few Tenacious D songs and some Shadows Fall stuff. I am really into Shadows Fall lately. They sound like they are really heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. They have some really beautiful acoustic tracks. Kind of a big contrast when you compare them to their 'known-for' stuff! Well I better go. In a bitsiz.
