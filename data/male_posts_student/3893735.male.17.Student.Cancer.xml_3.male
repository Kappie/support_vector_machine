Yesterday was the most exhausting day of my life, i went to the city with cam and bartles... was there a shop in the city that we didnt look at? NO!!! When we finally left cam was trying to convince the two of us to come to some Hunters dance party? bartles was smart and quickly went home, but being the sucker that i am i went back to cam's house. there duane soon showed up and they convinced me that it would be worth coming to, lies! We picked up some drinks and left for sutherland. When we got there to buy tickets some stoners where talking to duane so we couldnt get tickets! Woohoo, well thats what i thought till cam went back and got some... at this stage it was about 7pm, the stupid party didnt start till 7.30 and we had a bag full of alcohole, so we had to drink it down fast!  We stumbled into this over crowded hall thingy full of like year 9 and 10 kids! Im like, you guys came here to pick up??? desperate kids!!! as it turned out most of the night i spent sitting at the bar, while those two tried to get close to little girls, HAHAHA. I guess im the only one of us who didnt go to pick up... just not ready and it seems a lil sleezy, rather get to know chicks first... but thats just me lol.  By 10.30 i was wishing for a quick and painless death!!! it was so hot in there, and all these shire kids were prancing around :s... NOT MY SCENE, at 11.30 we made a group decision to get the hell outta there, the two boys didnt get close to picking up and i needed some tucker!   Caught the train to oatley and walked down to the bp in mortdale, where those two clowns were joking about being starving! when i was, so i boaght a whole bbq chicken at 12am and ate half on the way back to cam's house...  *reminder to self... never buy chicken from bp! then i msg'd about 5 ppl when i was at cams house lol, yeh ppl are gonna reply at 12.30??? well actually a few did, so i was like... woohoo!!!  Now im pretty down, coz i spent all my money yesterday on stupid shit! like a $10 chicken which i ended up throwing at a car and drinks which i didnt drink!!! Meant to go back to the city on thursday and drinking thursday night at olds or sumthin... sounds pretty stupid, but if people come it will be ok, then meant to be goin footy fri night... but this isnt gonna happen without funding!   Now im gonna go get some excercise to work off that chicken from last night lol, hope this has been an interesting experience for you all... reading the boring truth about my life...
