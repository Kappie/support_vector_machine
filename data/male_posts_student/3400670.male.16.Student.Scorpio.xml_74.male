I think it's always interesting when people who actually shaped the past are able to look back with perfect hindsight and evaluate what they did - right and wrong.  He said in an interview, "This century [the 20th] will go down as the bloodiest...we'll have lost 160 million people killed in conflict."  That's too many, I hope THIS century will be a lot more peaceful.  Speaking of which, how about the new warning from Ashcroft?? And... Gore's speech today, OH MY!  Anyway, have a good night!
