Ahhhh, I feel sort of embarassed posting this, but for a song created + rehearsed/improvised in only about a half hour, I don't think it's TOO bad...lol...it's easy to tell it was recorded with a computer microphone, too, but as Ottmar Liebert says in the notes for "Spring Rain", the music takes precedent over the recording quality     urlLink http://homepage.mac.com/austinsarner/Duende.mp3   The first and only track on Adam Solomon + Seth Halpern's collaboration album, "Duende", a collision of rock and flamenco guitars, recorded in one night of duende--the intense emotion that inspires flamenco music. Though Adam + Seth will be the first to admit there are mistakes (from the little of it that was not made on the spot), they try to integrate the mistakes into the beauty of the music. Hopefully you will feel the same way.  Above is the comment from the file tag itself...lol...it's pretty cool, my friend Seth + I were hanging out at my house a few weeks back, because he was moving to Florida the next week, and we ended up writing this song, it was pretty damn cool...we both switch off between rhythym and solo, with Seth writing the rhythym part (and me translating it to my flamenco guitar), and each of us writing our own solos.
