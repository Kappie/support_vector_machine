(where IS Alameda?!)    deciding not to go back to boring ole' santa rosa just yet, i decided to stop off i berkeley to face down navigational demons and hopefully pick up some cd's/records at Ameoba. suffice to say, i never did find Ameoba, just some college prepz and street peopleand the legendary Gilman Street venue.nothing too terribly exciting... and it was only 1030!    taking a brief detour towards Sacramento, it was time to play the musik loud and roll the windows down, drawing the ire of passing cars as they see you yelling along.    it was magic, and yet, the most surreal and karmic moment came when driving back from the Sacramento area across the Richmond Bridge. blue sky everywhere, ships passing under the bridge, high white clouds, beautiful ocean, and the city, all while listening to The Faint. the city, and the world for that matter was fucking mine at that moment, and nobody was in a position to tell me otherwise. should i drive off of the guardrail and die, it didnt matter; what mattered was the spectacle at hand and the muzik in the stereo, and suddenly ithought thatthe world made just a little bit more sense. i was happy, and i was in love.    i thought though- people really dont give the whole nature/cityscape scene the respect it deserves. personally, i love industrial sectors in cities. from the abandoned warehouse buildings and cement plants in santa rosa to the awesome shipyard/rail depot of the richmond area, its all beautiful, just not in a classical sense. i dont know, perhaps im just full of shit and dont know anything, but sometimes at night, coming back from san francisco, theres nothing that id rather see than the bay bridge at night- and while crossing it, looking back across the water at the city. city lights are hyped, but they never get old. i could walk down (and have) city streets at night, just not doing anything- walking with no purpose other than to observe. and big cities are all the better. cities never die, and hell, most never truly sleep either. walk out of a hotel room at 4Am and yeah, youll find something going on. it may not be art, but itll be something damn close to it. asthetics is all relative, and i know that im rather biased, but for my time, ill take the city any day (or night for that matter) even over its classically beautiful counterpart.    ..............................................................................................................    spent the rest of the day in petaluma visiting my relatives and playing DDR (thats Dance Dance Revolution) with my cousins for hours. god i love that game.    then i drove back on 101 until Rohnert Park where there was a mad accident and i got off the freeway. after being lost in Rohnert Park for about a half hour (so many dead end streetz and courts!), and then finally got home about 20 minz ago.    so, with 43 more minutes left in my day- i doubt it can get any better,though i wouldnt mind being proven wrong. ha. that was obvious.    yours,  -nick
