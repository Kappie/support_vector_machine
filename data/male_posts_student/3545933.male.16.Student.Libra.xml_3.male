Mission Achieved. I got to Rockingham, and as soon as i get there, before i step inside the gate, i see the local metal band  urlLink Tortion  beating out a kick ass beat. The rest of the day was spent in a corporate box watching oval-racing, listening to some great rock in a skate park, jumping about with the band in a bouncy castle and stealing tires from the paddock. Good times.  But anyway, 50 Cent = avoided, his ASCAR crashed into a wall and Rockingham wasn't as crowded as it usually is. Bonus, Bonus, Bonus. But unfortunately, the Darkness's car managed to break aswell, back-end fell off, leaving one more musically orientated car in the running, the Liberty X car. We can see that quality is always adorned when picking these cars.   well, whatever. longer junk here later. tata.
