That was kinda boring, but oh well. I met Josh at the mall around 1 this afternoon. We had lunch and then I applied for a few jobs. I think I applied for like 10 altogether. I got 2 on the spot interviews today. One was at Old Navy and the other was at Build-A-Bear. They made me sing Happy Birthday at Build-A-Bear. LOL. I have an interview Friday at The Buckle. Wish me luck! After I turned in all my applications, I went with Brandon to Best Buy. He was looking at new CD players for his car. Then we went to Krispy Kreme to get some doughnuts. YUMMM. Then I came back home and talked to Josh on the phone for a while and then talked to Holly for a while. I go to take my driving test on Friday. If my grandma can't take me Friday, then I will for sure go on Monday. I can't. Well, I will talk to you fine folks later. Feel free to comment on any of my entries. Peace out!
