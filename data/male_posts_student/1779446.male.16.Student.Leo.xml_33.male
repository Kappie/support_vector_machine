Rest assured that I WILL be in panic mode tonight.  I recently joined a youth group called antioch. Well, not exactly joined because I won't be going back there. Basically Antioch is a group of people who sing songs about God and talk about God. Much of these meetings are filled with "hug" times and hand holding and singing to tingly guitar chords from a guy who BORROWED MY PICK AND HASN'T RETURNED IT YET! Let me assure you, the "hug" times, bring a whole new dimension on the word "squishy". Especially because there is this big guy, who is a beast of a man, who crunches bones and eats bricks for breakfast.  This brings me to my next point. Our world as we know it, is being invaded. No not by aliens, but by a race of self-proclaimed "hip" "Cool" "aware" "loving" "communial" teens who call themselves "Christians". It's funny really, how it somehow becomes "cool" to be Christian. Wow. (this next section comes dripping with sarcasm). So to my readers, I am always venturing in ways to IMPROVE your lifestyles. So heres a "how-to" guide to become a self-proclaimed "hip" "cool" "aware" "loving" "communial" teen "Christian".  1) Buy yourself a bible. Not just any ordinary one, but the ones that you buy in COOL Christian bookstores. You know, the ones with the funky layouts, awesome fonts, afterwords and cool reflections!  2) Start going to the Hillsong. Yes, as an out going Christian, you must go to church, well at least, HILLSONG! Hillsong is that place on Norwest Boulevard where you go to WORSHIP God, in the truest way possible... WITH ROCK MUSIC, CONCERTS, DAZZLING LIGHT EFFECTS, FOOT STAMPING AND AWESOMELY COOL ENTRY PRICE FEES! I mean, hey, isn't that what Christianity is all about? Rock music and young people.  I mean, we're not learning to be TRUE christians by going to church at 10 am in the mornings, sitting through sermons and recieveing our Lord in the form of the Sacred Eucharist... Christianity is about love... and rock music. Who ever knew God was so fun! Or music so profitable!  3) Start a Christian blog. Make sure you emblazon it with: I LOVE GOD~~!1!!!1ONE ONE LOL~! and JOURNEY PATH MATTHEW 22:1! or LuV ThY NEGHBORRR! Tell the world how christian you're being by not smoking, not doing drugs, not watching violent movies and playing with random childrenin the street!  4) Adorn yourself with Crosses. What better way to worship our Lord than FASHION! You can not only look cool, but you can also display what a proud child of God you are! Don't skimp on those Kswiss shoes, rolex watches and levis! Let's go dancing!  Actually I might stop there, maybe some people might find this offensive, being the good, honourable Christians you are. I'm sounding quite sacreligious.   Myself? I'm a Catholic, a guy who goes with his family once a week to church, recieves his communion, goes to confession and prays (almost) every night. I have no beef with God, or Christian. I'm sure there are plenty of really good Christian people out there, helping people in need, going to church and stuff. But it's that minority of pimple faced, brainwashed, tween, bimbos that really put me down.  So what was the whole point of this excerise? This stupid rant?  Children, the moral of this story is: "It's cool to be Christian, because it's all about rock music and love and feelings. Who gives a crap about doctrines and church when we could go to the Hillsong?"
