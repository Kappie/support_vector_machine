I now have all this time on my hands that I don't know what to do with...well, not so much time. There's really only 5 weeks.    alt="My friend Peter">  It's about that time of year when everyone's getting back in touch with old friends and whatnot. In the last day I've gotten emails from or talked with 5 Duke friends and Will, a guy I went to high school with. One thing I've started doing is writing letters to people. Why? Well, 'cause email sucks, that's why. Shouldn't email just be used to send quick messages to people? More meaningful messages just don't work with email. For these kinds of messages you just can't beat a real hand-written letter. It's an art that's been lost among our generation.   In the last year I've learned some pretty important stuff that isn't tested on board exams. I've listed a few of these lessons below:  1. It's easy to blame the world or others around me, but usually I'm the biggest cause of my own problems. See, a year ago I thought that coming back home would solve the problems that I had while I was at Duke. While parking is much easier here, the real problems I have don't resolve themselves just with a change in venue.   2. I spend way too much time feeling unsatisfied. I really should be more thankful for what I have, especially given that I've never really had to fear for my own life.   3. I'm not used to change and/or asking for help, but there's an absolute time for both. Pathology was probably the most difficult course for me this year; I would not have improved as much as I did without the help of my tutoring group.   I think those are the biggest 3. Oh, hey, I almost forgot to mention...I'm going to Las Vegas! On July 11th I'll be going with 3 other friends to Vegas for a week of crazy, kick-ass fun. Awe-some!
