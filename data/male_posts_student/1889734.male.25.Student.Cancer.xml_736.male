I still want to see it, but from the opening previews I feared the CGI/Summer Movie feel would make for a bad experience.  I still highly recommend reading, or re-reading, the Iliad.  It shouldn't take long, and it really packs a punch for a three thousand year old piece of literature.  Sing the rage of Achilles!
