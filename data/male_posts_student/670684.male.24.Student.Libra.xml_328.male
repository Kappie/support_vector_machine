One of the vignettes in the documentary revolves around Maggie Lauterer, a community journalist in Asheville, NC who decided to run for congress.  She was the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington story full-on.    And she was hated by quite a few in the area, because she didn't know how politics worked.  She listened to people, she asked questions, she took criticism to heart.  And she was attacked mercilessly by Charles Taylor, her incumbent opponent.    Everyone talks about wanting a Mr. Smith...the local boy gone right, who will bring morals to politics.  But when they come out, they don't put on the pretty face that most politicians have lived their life building.    So when I read less than objective journalism like  urlLink this , that goes after Howard Dean's impassioned campaign speech in Iowa (which I thought was kind of fun), it baffles me.  Here's a guy who is not a career politician...who has never really run a tough campaign...he was a state senator, then lieutenant governor, and then he took the governor's seat when the actual governor died...from that point on, it was re-elections, and those weren't tough.  This is his first campaign...he's won by being himself...now he is losing because he's trying that.    People want honesty, but when they see it live, they get turned off from it...a guy shows passion, and he's lambasted by the media, neoconservative talk radio and "mainstream" media alike.  And we let Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity call the media "liberal."  When was the last time I saw an article from AP with an anti-Bush slant?  I can find one on Dean every day...usually a lot more than one.    Kucinich still gets my vote, but Dean is a close second, and moreso now that I see just how ridiculous the media is being regarding his campaign.  The guy is going to lose because he's being spun as a buffoon, when in fact he's more like the average layman than any other candidate.  And that's what everyone says they want in Washington.    ---  Breakfast with Kathy Fell and some other Centenary alums this morning.  I love getting up early and accomplishing things with my day.  And to hear some of the great stories people have about olden days at the 'nary...that school is home to some crazy things that are undocumented...just as every school is.    PROJECT IDEA - get 150 or 200 alums, and ask them for one of their favorite memories from Centenary.  Then take a picture of them from that point in time, as well as a picture now, and have kind of a positive coffee table book that is quite pertinent to Centenary College, but also just reminds people of what the college experience is.  Something I can work on over time.
