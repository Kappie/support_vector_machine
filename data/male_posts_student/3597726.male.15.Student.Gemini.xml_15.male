I was like the worst player, but I did get much better in the Vietnam game. By Tuesday morning I was the best shot out of us three. But I was also the stupidest player. Haha. My name was "!!Don't shoot!!." Yeah. It was cool. Droo and I played Rune till like 5:30 in the morning. Droo also showed me some sweet new bands and music videos. I think we watched 'New Medicines' by Dead Poetic, 'Rose of Sharyn' by Killswitch Engage, and some Funeral for a Friend song like a billion times.   Anyway, a whole bunch of other people went out to see spiderman 2 when I was gone. I was planning on seeing it with all of them on friday, but they decided to see it on monday instead. But Droo's house was a blast.  Thomas is coming over today to spend the night and we might be going to the Essigs for a game night. Can't wait!
