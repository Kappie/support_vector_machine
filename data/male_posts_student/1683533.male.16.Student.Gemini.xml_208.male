Here is the article:    Every Time I Die    Punk'd   By Jim Derogatis  Andy Williams, guitarist for Buffalo, New York's southern rock-meets-speedcore quintet Every Time I Die, got the shock of his short life when he learned his band had snagged a slot on Ozzfest 2004.  "We were on tour in England with Chimaira when I got a call from our manager," says Williams. "He said, 'The label has some news.  I don't want to tell you what it is, so give them a call.' So I called our label, Ferret, and they said 'Some girl is calling here and saying you got her pregnant.  She wants to know how to get ahold of you.'       "I started freaking out,"Williams continued,"But finally they said 'No, dude, you got on Ozzfest!' We were outside at the time, standing next to this dumpster, and we started breaking bottles and screaming.  It was one of the most chaotic and surreal moments of my life.  To go on tour with Ozzy!- it's a dream come true!"      Every Time I Die  formed in 1998 after their members-Williams, guitarist Jordan Buckley, singer Keith Buckley (Jordan's brother) bassist John McCarthy and drummer Michael Novak- kept running into one another  at underground punk and metal shows in the Buffalo area.  "We just liked the same music", says Jordan. "I guess it was fate we wound up jamming together."      The group made it's recorded debut  Last Night in Town  in 2001-"It wasnt very good," says Buckley-and followed it up last year with the much stronger   Hot Damn!    (Cups: that's the cd I got, and it's really good guys, it's what I am listening to most now.) , winning raves from fans on the hardcore punk/metal scene.      "We had about three weeks to write the record, so we decided to lock ourselves in our practice space and go at it," says Williams,"it was insane, but I couldnt be happier with the results.  We definitly work well under pressure."  Fin
