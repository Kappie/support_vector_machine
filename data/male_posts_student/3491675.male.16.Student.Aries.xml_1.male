Arrows of water now make way to ponds and streams where images and figures form and dance in the tides, trees with so many stories to tell of the old, wishing to move to better spot's they find themselves unable to. An exile with nature forms around forgotten by life, steps and leaps are near and far,knowledge put at rest by the fading blue.
