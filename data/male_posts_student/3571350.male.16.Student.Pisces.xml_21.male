So I'm on here most of the day and I know I need a life but where is it? It's definitely not around here. Anywho nothing much to right about except my parents are still on-off fighting. they're off it now thankfully and they think they can fight when i'm trying to sleep and when i tell them i'm trying to sleep they just yell at me. what the fuck is that. well gonna stop writin now. c ya soon
