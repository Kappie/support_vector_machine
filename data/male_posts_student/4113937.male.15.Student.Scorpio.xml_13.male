I focus on chapter 2  4 and the question came out for chapter 4.  I was so happy when i see the question was about switzerland.  Managed to finish doing section b within the time i planned.  However, for section a didn't managed to finish my last question, and it was the most important point.  Nevermind, try harder for my 'n' level which will be coming shortly.  after the paper went to queenway shopping centre to got someone to print the NCO tee for us.  The shirt cost me $22 and it was quite.. haha.. overall it worth it.  At least when i get old, i still know that i have a squad that is so fun.. haha.. after that went to ikea to see what to get for my new room.. Although had to share room with my granny, i don't mind cause i had a private bathroom.  Feel quite bad for giving the comment i gave just now, keep it back and put it back into my mouth.  Finally i found out what i can give to the sec 2 and they will be able to use it.  Hope they like it.  This blog rock, better than the old one.  Should had changed it long time ago.  haha.. okay.. shall end here.. see ya!
