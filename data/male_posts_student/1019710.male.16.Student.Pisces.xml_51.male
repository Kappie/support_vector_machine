My family and I decided to take a trip to NBC and tour the studios. The tour was great but once we got out we saw on the news ticker "NBC Employee has anthrax."  Mom: "Oh that's just lovely"   Well we get out and are about to walk away from the scene when my dad who was alread tired began to pass out (we later found out it was also from the blood pressure medicine that he takes) Ok so i'm flipping out and the media think that I am a complete retard that thinks he has anthrax (not to say that there wern't people like that in the crowd)  3 days later i arrive back in NC, and one of my best friend's sister (who was my bro's friend) calls and asks if we were in NYC that week, he says yes and she told us that her mom was in Canada and I had made the front page of the Globe and Mail, one of the largest newspapers in Canada, (The picture was huge too)   Don't believe me, check out this search of gettyimages.com   http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/CFW/imageResults.aspx?s=ImagesAdvancedSearchState|2|15||0||1|||||0|0|0|| 0|Justin+Sullivan|7|anthrax|513023||0  I am the last row, middle picture.
