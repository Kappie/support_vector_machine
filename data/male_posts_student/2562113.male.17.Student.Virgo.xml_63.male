Finally got up here Monday afternoon and wasted no time doing guess what - DRINKING - with my suitemates and good friends up at Club 21. Beer pong, drunken karaoke, card games, and good times pretty much sum up the past couple of days. Tonight I learned how to play Texas Hold 'Em (a spinoff of poker) - it's a great game! We started out with 8 people and it came down to me and Bob dueling it out, but he's too good at it so I lost all my chips rather quickly. Give me a few weeks and I'll own all of you...  Today was the first day of classes, and guess what happens -- the MyUAlbany server goes down so I can't get my new class schedule off the computer! That means everyone on campus has no idea when or where their classes are! Utter confusion all day long. I think I made it to all the right classes...  More good news: My macroeconomics professor can barely speak English. I should get 6 credits for taking that class: 3 credits for completing the class, and 3 credits for interpreting Chinese.  We stole a huge new couch from the hall so any visitors to Cooper 207 will have a nice couch to pass out on. Come visit ANYTIME!  Gotta wake up for a 8:45AM Physics lecture tomorrow (blehhhh), so I gotta get going.  Peace!!!  -BIGsmut.
