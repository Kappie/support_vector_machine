I started this as a way to spout off my thoughts and ideas regarding the world, with a specific interest in politics.  I want to keep doing that, but of late I've been finding it difficult to update it each day.    Well, I've decided that continuing is worth it.  The exercise keeps my mind agile, and prevents me from sinking into a lethargy here at work.  Quite frankly, my job requires little attention from me, so it is easy to slide into a vegitative state here.  The Blog helps keep me awake and aware, so I must continue posting.  So look for more activity today.  As always, please chime in with your own thoughts.  And if anyone would like posting permission so you can add to this on your own, I have no problem with that.  Just let me know.
