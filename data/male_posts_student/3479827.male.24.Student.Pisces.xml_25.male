At one point the staff gathered round to look at us, while (badly) pretending to go about their business. We both woke up quite early today and had breakfast (zao fan) with yuqi's mum. I had some lovely fried pancakes filled with spring onion and some really creamy fresh milk (niu nai). We discussed how strange it is having everyone stop and stare all the time. We decided the best course of action is to ignore them and concentrate on enjoying ourselves. After lunch we prepared our things for our train journey. Packing enough for 2 people into 1 backpack is quite a challenge! Next, rather than carrying around hordes of cash (which is like holding a sign saying "please rob me") yuqi decided to open a bank account so we could use card rather than cash. We deposited 4000 yuan (about 300 pounds) to keep us going. At 3 o'clock we took a taxi to the station to catch the train. Shijiazhuang station is quite large and very very busy. Imagine a medium size english station with enough people to fit inside london paddington and that's almost what it's like. The train itself is quite a long one with very tall carriages. Each carriage has about 10 compartments with 6 bunk beds. Three on each wall facing each other. Yuqi and i have facing middle bunks, with a somewhat elderly couple below us. Getting into the bunk was quite fun, it's high up, and there's not enough room for me to sit up!  The train is very clean and modern, just as well as i'm on it for 16 hours. I'm going to lay in my bunk now and watch china fly by the window, i'll update again soon. For now, zai jian!
