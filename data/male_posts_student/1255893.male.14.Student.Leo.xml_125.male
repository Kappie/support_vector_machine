Is it just me, or for the last 10-15 posts as she been at least mentioning the fight between me, her, and Ave? I personally don't want to make any comments about that, if only or the sake of sparing myself a word fight (cus we know that's as far as it'll get). I'll let my readers post comments on this shit if they want, but I don't really care.  Today was the 1st day that I had to wear my ROTC uniform.  It wasn't as big a deal as I thought it would be, though that thing was really HOT! And the pants seem a bit short. I have a few essays due tomorrow and Wednesday... Looks like I'll be stayin up late for a few more nights :( I won't complain though. I luv the stuff we're learning.  Lj came home for the weekend, it was great to see that slut again:-P   If i think of more crap to talk about I'll post again. L8R for now.
