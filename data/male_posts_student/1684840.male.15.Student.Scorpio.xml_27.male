I scoffed myself silly, but probably not as much as other people did though 8->  It's been a wicked day to end of the dreaded place which makes us learn (regime which must not be named).  I'll probably have a sugar hangover in the morning lol *hic* ;)  Im off to bed now cuz my eyes wont stay open Â¦-{
