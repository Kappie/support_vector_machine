Basically I am pissed off with  NPCC  as the stupid seniors called me up so late in the night ... so I see the prefect  Mister David Lu (or Loo)  wear a prefect blazier for the training when I am only wearing home clothes. I think he wants to show off to the  RGS girls  (not chio one!) that he is a prefect (a method of wooing perhaps). He claims that  he has to rush back to RI  later for the GEP Open House at 1.15pm.            It seems like  maths pro Yeong Li Qian  is unable to solve the maths problems today, perhaps he is too tired or bored to do them. Ronald Chan, our class 'koper', is so ks that he copies everything down and makes me very much worried. He always talk a lot of trash in class.           It seems like the SIMO people are tired of  curry puffs  (makes me want to puke by the way) and they now only serve packet drinks. It is not like we like to eat curry puffs.           By the way, next week is the  history drama finals  and I hope our school can win the championship ...      WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!
