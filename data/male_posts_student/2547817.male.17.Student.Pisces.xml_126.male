I chose to take it positively by reasoning to myself that there were no small roles, only small actors. I wrote that down on the script. I'm so used to saying "score" rather than "script". Jon was cast a nice role. The more I do this, the more I think I suck at it. Okay... maybe not suck... but the inferiority complex is definitely creeping up on me again. This wouldn't be the case if I was in Pioneer or if Zel was around. She gave me life.  Went to see the Potter flick with the drama people.. Steph came along and that made me feel slightly better. Didn't even see Hazel. So yah. It was weird, coz I wanted to although I knew she'd go all out to spite me. Yet, at the same time, I asked Steph along to be my dampener. Why do I hurt myself this way? Sado masochist.  There was a damn tight Goth band, wearing Manson T-shirts save for the lead guitarist who was topless, playing at the blood donation drive stage outside cinileasure when we left. The EQ was just about right too. I didn't really give a hoot about it till I heard the singer hold a solid note. The singer had heavily bleached hair and was definitely albino. Like no melanin content in his skin. He looked like he was the one who needed blood.  We went to Ken's after that. All in all, I've used up a large portion of my week's allowance and will suffer for the next seven days. We ate pizza and had 6 bottles of Corona- at the start. We bummed about a bit more and jammed till about 11.30, then we went for generals at peace centre. We all packed into Eric's car and it was damn close to the road. We did a hundred on the freeways and flyovers with the stereo blasting some techno shat. Groovy. My arm was outside the window and my palm swam against the oncoming air at 100km/h. I chucked the 7-up can outside the window and watched it tumble wildly behind us as we sped away. Close to peace centre, Ken began terrorizing other drivers beside our car with ghoulish noises with his tongue far out of his mouth and his hand showing horns. haha.  Got home at about 1 and bummed about more. Went to the airwell under the bridge and did my first piece of graffiti. The symbol I created out of HZL. Took a snapshot, then returned and had TWO solid, pure shots of J.Walkers, some apricot wine and then another bottle of wine all to myself. Didn't finish the last bottle. It had a nice rose and I'd bet it'd cost a bomb. Was too concerned with what was about to happen next.  We'd been wanting to thrash his neighbour's place for some time now but Ken backed down when the dog-killer drove past the house when we were all on the roof. He knew we were there. I wasn't about to back off so I did it alone. Everyone was very apprehensive and didn't want me to do it. I did it anyway whilst playing a game with myself. Dodging behind cars and jumping into drains to avoid being seen by taxis and home owners. Heart beat was samba as I approached the house quietly. The neighbouring house had a dog sleeping at the front gate. I crept up, assessed the target area and performed the hit and made my way back to the house. Now, why did I do it? For revenge which was not mine to exact or for the thrill?  After that, the guys went upstairs to talk about girls. I remained downstairs, lying on the couch, just... thinking. Remembering.  We were late for service and I, for the first time in a LONG time, intentionally slept in service. I was woken up at the end by a terrible singing of my favourite "as the deer". My face contorted with pain. Went for lunch and then home.  Didn't have as much of a ball as I would have liked to, and I certainty didn't manage to get wasted. Wasted. Ken was afraid I'll hurl all over his place. Well, at least I know I can hold my liquor well. So ends my not so short narrative. Till the next time guys!
