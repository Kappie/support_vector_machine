I shall die for Jimtopia, as I was made from Jimtopia.  I will not let my mind be manipulated by such liberal propaganda or suggestions such as the addition of an X chromosome to this website.  Bitch: the New Deal act was diagonal and you know it.    "Get to know two things about a man. How he earns his money and how he spends it. You will then have the clue to his character. You will have a searchlight that shows up the inmost recesses of his soul. You know all you need to know about his standards, his motives, his driving desires, his real religion."  And if Anna spends her money on booze and porn, I think it says everything we need to know.
