The movie will be titled "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith".  Company fan relations director, Steve Sansweet, made the announcement in lieu of George Lucas. Lucas, the founder of LucasFilms and creator of the "Star Wars" movies, rarely attends conventions and is currently working in post-production on this, the sixth film in the franchise.   While filming the final movie of the original trilogy, Lucas released promotional information and material stating that the movie would be called "Revenge of the Jedi". However, he later changed the name after deciding that revenge was not very Jedi-like. The film became "Return of the Jedi" instead.  This title is due to upset some fans and please others, much like announcement of the titles for the previous prequels. Many fans feel that the prequel's titles are too childish and "hokey-sounding". However, older fans realize that these titles are a homage to the serial Science-Fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s. (And really, they're no worse than the original trilogy's titles; Come on, "A New Hope", "the Empire Strikes Back"? That fits right in with "the Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones".) Also, with each of the prequels nearly mirroring the events and tones of the original trilogy, having the final prequel named "Revenge of the Sith" gives a sense of closure to the series and returns to where the original movies ended.  I like it. Now, let's just hope there are no references to midi-chlorians, and Jar-Jar is in this film about as much as the second.     (Editor's Note: No, I wasn't on-hand to see the announcement myself, or even hear about it fom the screaming and cheering. However, I was supposed to be. Instead, I was at home helping paint my mother's living room. Yay for me.)
