The helpful people at HP had pretty good directions about how to open up your computer, and install a PCI card.  With one exception.  they say to remove the expansion slot cover, without any further explaination.  The expansion slot cover, it turns out, is attached tot he body of the computer with small metal tabs.  I think that the idea is to bend htem back and forth a couple of times until they break off.  That's what I tried anyway, but then I noticed that doing so was pushing this metal piece into something that looked vaugely important.  So I took a pair of pliers (actually the pliers part of my Swiss Army Multitool) and pulled it towards me.  It came off.  But in the process I jammed this metal expansion slot cover into the heel of my palm and started dripping blood everywhere.  I don't think it needs stitches, but I think I will have a neat scar.  But that's ok cuz pain is temporary, glory lasts forever, and chicks dig scars, right?
