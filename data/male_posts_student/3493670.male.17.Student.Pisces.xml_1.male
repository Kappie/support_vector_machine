Knowing that I will have a long and full day, I wanted to be relaxed so I opted to wear my red Oxygen shirt with my gray Nautica Clamdiggers and my trusty sandals. I went to my house in Makati to visit my mom first.      11:00am, when I reached my house in Makati, my mom emerged from the shower and told me that she wants to go shopping! Yey! So we went to glorietta to go shopping. We had brunch at French Baker Landmark branch and the food was great! After having brunch and a good conversation with my mom, I was starting to be really happy.      Not forgetting that I still have to meet Felix at 1pm, I decided to haul my ass along with my mom to the stores of Landmark to buy her stuff. She bought her stuff while I was standing around texting my Ate Barbie. Aware of the fact that shopping could take quite some time, I texted Felix and told him that I was gonna be late and wait for my text. I never thought shopping for clothes could take so long! And before I knew it, It was already 03:30! I was mortified! And as I watched my mom take the cab home and I found out that am fresh out of prepaid credits, I frantically ran to the nearest phone booth to call him up and uh oh! He sounds pretty pissed...      Must admit I was pretty nervous to hear his voice. I ran from glorietta to Mercury drug park square to buy some stuff and headed to the MRT Ayala station.      As I boarded the overloaded MRT car, I had no thought in mind but him. Was he mad? What am I gonna do? What Am I gonna say? I could hear my heart beating and my knees were growing weaker but I was standing up and I was drenched in sweat. And before I knew it, I was getting off at GMA Kamuning station.      I re-applied perfume and popped some breath mints while walking my way to Red Ribbons Kamias branch. Upon reaching Red Ribbons, my heart stopped. The noise around me suddenly stopped. I could hear my heart beating again. I was surrounded by silence despite the noises around me. There he was, in his gray shirt, looking disturbingly good! I entered the place and said hello. I apologized profusely because I was late and must admit it was partly my fault. He told me that he was having a headache. We decided to go somewhere private where we can be alone. We were lying in bed and I was just staring at him and I realized, we belong together. We like each other, we're crazy about each other and most of all we were in love. And I believe love will suffice.     When it was 11pm, we decided to hit the road and go to glorietta to have dinner in World Chicken but unfortunately, when we reached the place, World Chicken was closed already so we opted to have dinner at Wendy's. After the dinner, we talked a little and went down to go home. We smoked cigs while walking around glorietta. We both know its getting late yet I still wanted to stay longer, I opted to compromise. It was already almost 1am and he has to go all the back to kamias where he lives. He opted to see me off and I texted him when I got home.     It was nice. It was fun. It was sheer bliss...
