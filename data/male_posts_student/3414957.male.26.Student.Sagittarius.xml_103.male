I want to do my homework now and the family wants me to tear apart some tent shade thing that they used for the 4th. So I do that, but then they have to chime in on how its being done. I wanted to just get it over with but simple things take forever in my family. Thats why I am different from them. I tackle things and solve or destroy them very quickly so I can move on to something else more important.   Now I begin my homework.
