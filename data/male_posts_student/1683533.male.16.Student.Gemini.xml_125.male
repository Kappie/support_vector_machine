They are working on an EP with my cousin on it, you can download  "Bitter Ending"    urlLink here .  I like it.  They are also going on tour in May.     Designed By You   is more local and is pretty new,  I managed to go to one of their concerts a little while ago, and they were good.  They call themselves "skacore" a mix of ska (no horns) and hardcore.  You can download their song  "Happyness to Sorrow"    urlLink here  that will be on their split EP with My Friend Ehab (local hardcore band).  As I said before, he is going on tour in May and coming back in june, and he said he would record our band in his finished studio, so that gives us about a month and a half to get our songs together which will probably plenty of time.  The only bad part is that school will be ending just as it comes out so we will have a harder time getting word out because school would be a really good way to get people's attention.  Just wanted to fill you in on some local news, check out those songs and download them.
