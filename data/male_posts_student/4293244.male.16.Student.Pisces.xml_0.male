She called Colonel Henderson and invited him over for dinner next week. All that week I counted off the days until Friday night when the Mrs. And Mrs. Henderson would come over for dinner. People coming over to my house was never good news. It meant I had to clean up for a week in advance and keep it clean for a week. I had to get all cleaned up and be on my best manners. Normally it was just bad because most of the time it was some guy coming over to talk about my dad for hours.                 I went out and acted normal and played baseball but there was something in the back of my mind the whole time. Something kept nagging me, something about the way the Colonel had said he would like to see my mother. There was something very nerve racking about the whole thing. I kept it in the back of my mind though. It may seems stupid and overreacting to you but I swear I did not sleep more then an hour Thursday night. Then Friday night at six sharp the doorbell rang.                 I had to entertain the guests and get them something to drink like a good little boy while my mother finished all the little details to the dinner she had been preparing all day. Something was bugging her too it was probably all this. These types of dinners are bad for everyone if you ask me, I never got why grownups did it.                 “These mashed potatoes are great. Where did you say you got this wine?” Same old pleasantries. That was pretty much the deepest dinner conversation went that night. I said nothing I got the feeling pretty soon that this dinner really had nothing to do with me. You’d think I’d be relieved. I finished dinner and cleared everyone’s places and went into the kitchen with Mrs. Henderson who insisted on helping with the dishes. It was very annoying, mom had assumed the role of dad and I had been stuck with the women’s work. Mrs. Henderson  was nice about it and didn’t make me actually wash the dishes just hand them to her. It’s not that I don’t normally wash dishes but it’s not the type of thing I normally do at these formal type things. I was twelve years old, honestly.                 Mrs. Henderson seem to take her time. She was real loud about it too, humming and doing stuff like that. I knew it was to cover up the muffled voices coming from the other room. I wanted to hear desperately but even if she wasn’t humming I still couldn’t hear Colonel Henderson and my mom. So I just gave up and went on washing.                 Pretty soon Mr. and Mrs. Henderson were getting up, thanking us for dinner and all the usual stuff. We made some small talk for about a minute before they left. Mother was being very cordigal and everything until they left she suddenly looked very solemn and almost sad. She said nothing though and I knew better then to ask her what Colonel Henderson had said. She announced she was tired and went to bed. It was nearly eight. I stayed up for about ten minutes then I too went to bed even though the sun was just setting. I’m pretty sure neither of us slept at all that night.                 I had always felt bad for my mother. Her parents had both died a year after I had been born. She had always planned to have four children. I guess with my father always being gone and all it hadn’t really worked out. She had been pregnant but miscarriaged when I was about four. It had been a big blow to me because I had always wanted a little brother. Then since my dad was shot down I swear she hasn’t slept a full night. I guess for now I’m all that she has and she can’t stand that she has to leave me during the day and go to work. I know all the sacrifices she’s made for me but sometimes I think she holds more in then she ought to.                  The summer wound on and the days got longer and then shorter. Even when they were shrinking they still seemed too long. Odd for a kid to hate summer right? I never liked it. It was hot, I barely ever saw my mother and the only kid I had to play with was Fred. I grew tried of Fred but he never seemed to tire of me. He was like a loyal dog. A Jack Terrier, that’s what he was, always excitedly nipping at my heels. When I spoke of the coast and all the wonders over the ridge he’d join in too talking about when his dad got home and stuff like that.                 I discouraged him as much as possible. There is nothing I hated to see more then some kid with high hopes. I’d tell him his father was rotting in some ditch in Vietnam. I’d tell him his mother could never afford to move. I’d tell him all about the ugly truths of the world. You could see his spirits sink and I felt a little better. I’d always believed it was best to recognize the reality and people who liked to believe what they wanted frustrated me.                 One day he said for about the millionth time that he’d come with me. I said in my annoyance “No you wont, when I move I’ll probably never see you again, you’ll go to school on the base and I’ll go to school out there.” This really discouraged him and he disappeared. I was shocked by this. He just disappeared and I don’t mean I didn’t see him again that afternoon, I didn’t see him again that week, nor did anyone else on the block, or his mom. He ran away.                 I’ll tell you at the time it didn’t bother me very much. The hours of wondering the streets wore me down though. When I can’t get into the house, Fred’s not around and none of the other boys will play with me I wonder the street. I like seeing all the houses. They all look almost identical, they are all painted the same, the same cars are seen over and over colors varying and the shrubberies even resemble each other. Still I find something in them interesting. I would look at those houses and see the family. Many of them I had no idea who lived there, I had never seen them before even though Heaven’s Peak wasn’t that big. It made me sick to live in the neighborhood and visualizing the life inside made it slightly easier. Everything was the same, just as it should be and neat. Half the things were fake because nothing really grew in the desert.                 It is pretty sad now that I look back on it that I had to do that. My mom probably would have given me the keys to the house had she known how bad it was. I admit I played a key part in making the kids reject me but it hurt no less. It tore me up inside that my only friend was Fred and how lucky I felt simply to be able to play for ten minutes with the other boys. It tore me up that I was all alone in this town. It was like a sane boy living in an insane asylum although I didn’t see it that way at the time. The whole situation hurt. The houses became repetitive after a while and I began to miss Fred. I felt I could take it no more but somehow I did walking up those same lonely streets for one more day barely holding back the tears of rage and resentment.                 It was not long after that that my mom would come home and give me reprieve from my depression. For a night I would forget about all of it. Dad, Fred, the other boys, Heaven’s Peak and the town over the mountains. I would watch TV with her and eat dinner and talk. We talked a lot. We talked mostly about what I would do tomorrow (all lies) or in two years, or what I wanted to be when I grew up. I talked about what we would do when Dad got home but she never seemed to have much input. Mostly we would talk about the future though. It was wonderful.                 Then I’d go to bed and very shortly after she would too. She would find sleep immediately. She always did. I think she was so exhausted from work, cleaning and cooking that she could barely stay awake for our conversations. She did though and that I will always remember. I would not sleep. Night was when I got depressed. I would stare at my ceiling unable to sleep for hours, I’d blame it on the heat or all the sugar I had eaten even when I ate none. Still I would sit there alone with my mind. I would think of the most terrible things, never the good things. Sometimes I’d wake up with tears in my eyes but I didn’t know why. I was afraid mom would hear me so often I slept with my face in the pillow. It was no way to live but at the time it was all I knew.                 It was that week that I sat on the couch with my mom. It was then that we were phoned. It was just at nightfall. Fred had been missing for nearly three weeks now and I was crazy with guilt and depression although no one knew it. I doubt if even I was aware of it. My mother answered as she always did. She ran over in excitement and turned on the TV.                 “Daddy’s coming home.” She said excitedly.                 I smiled despite my best efforts to stifle it. She sat next to me on the couch and we were glued to that screen. When she turned it on the door on a plane was just opening. It had been on the news for a while now and things were just starting to happen. I can’t easily describe the elation that I felt, it was like nothing most humans have ever experienced. That I sat watching as those ragged men came off the plane. We watched each man. That wasn’t dad, nor he, nor he, we counted each on off almost certain next it would be dad, I had seen pictures of him and I knew exactly what he looked like. The ravages of Vietnam couldn’t change the look in my father’s eyes, that I knew.                 We watched them all come off. Until it was announced that the last man would be coming out shortly. We watched as that last man came out of that door. I looked at the face. It wasn’t dad. You can’t describe that feeling either. What now? I thought. None of them were dad. I sat there in silence next to my mother, neither of us dared speak. We were both thinking the same thing.                 I got up from the couch suddenly determined. My mother was in too much shock to notice this. I was angry. I knew something was wrong, it couldn’t be, it couldn’t be. In the back of my mind it all made sense though. The hushed voices of my mother and Colonel Henderson. The strange looks of all the officers that lived around here and would have known my dad. I knew what I had to do. I would leave, this place, I no longer saw any point in sticking around.                 I went to the garage and got my bike. I was careful not to scratch the car as I led the bike to the door and opened it. I rolled my bike down the driveway and took off down the street. I left the garage door wide open.                 It was still dusk. The beautiful soft hues of blue and gray lingered on the horizon as the first stars came out and the street lights blinked on simultaneously. I tore down the street trying to get away from the orderly lawns as fast as possible. I raced past Colonel Henderson’s house and Fred’s and everyone’s leaving them behind. I would ride as far as I could this night. I didn’t care that I brought no water or no food, I could find them out in the wilderness. I would become like and Indian and hunt game and ride from watering hole to watering hole. I didn’t care about anything.                 It didn’t take long to leave Heaven’s Peak behind. I never looked back. Had I looked back I was afraid I would have stopped. Nothing installs reason in boys like civilization. It was not a good thing. I wanted to ride away and never come back, all the yellow lights from bedrooms of sons who knew their fathers were on the way home only would make me miss my mother. It was too late, I was a man now and I was ready to carve a chunk of life out for myself or so I thought.                 I rode up that desert road all night. The earth around me was flat and dark. Coyotes howled somewhere nearby into the night’s sky and all the bugs that I had come to hate were out. The desert looked almost pretty at night, almost. My legs grew sore but I pushed on determined to reach that ridge before mom noticed that I was missing and went looking for me. I rode until the road became a path. Then I rode until I reached the foot of the “mountains.” Then I rode along the base of the ridges until I found the easiest place to climb.                 At this point both my tires were flat and my bike was no longer shiny. I was covered in dust from head to toe and my eyes were bloodshot from the winds. I felt sick and tired but I didn’t let it slow me down. A fire now burned inside of me with such ferocity that I could not make it yield. So I pushed on farther and farther. I climbed up the ridge often on all fours until my hands bled and were caked with mud. I climbed as fast as I could and ran as much as I walked.                 I watched as I got closer and closer until I was only feet away from the point I had hiked with my troop. I looked over my shoulder to Heaven’s Peak, which was now just a glowing site in the distance. The sky was changing color in the east. It was turning into a gray as the sun was beginning its ascension into the sky. I quickened my pace reaching farther and moving quicker. I could see the top coming. I was now in a race with the sun. I moved fast. I finally collapsed on the top.                 I turned my head back to the east breathing heavily on all fours. My whole body was sore, I was exhausted mentally and physically but it was all right because I had beat the sun. The first sliver peaked over the eastward mountains. I smiled.                 It was only now that I turned and looked over the mountains that I had long dreamed of crossing. I looked west and what I saw brought pure horror and gave me a sick feeling in my gut. A housing development. It was one identical to Heaven’s Peak. Everything was the same. It was waking up to dawn as I was sure Heaven’s Peak was doing miles away. I was disappointed beyond description of words. I looked at it as twenty of the same cars drove down the road to work at the Air Force Base, as the first lights in the house went on and the street lights faded out. The only word I could speak in my dry mouth was “No.”                 A car was driving down the dirt path from Heaven’s Peak’s direction. It was my mother’s car. She had come for me. I sat down on a rock and waited. She would take me back I knew. I did not know what would happen after that and I didn’t care anymore. I just sat there.                 I won’t tell you what became of Fred or what would become of me. I don’t think you’d like it. I know I didn’t. I will tell you this if Fred had been waiting for me when I got home, I would have told him I had seen the coast, and it was beautiful.   :Once again feedback whether or not you feel I'll like it will be greatly appreciated. It's been a while since I've seen this one it has been in computer "gathering dust" for a while and there are probably numerous grammar errors and a few typos.  I'll have more of this type later:
