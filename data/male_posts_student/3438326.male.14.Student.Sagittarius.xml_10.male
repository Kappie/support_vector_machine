Maybe Its nothing, Maybe Its all just in my mind, Maybe I'm foolish, Maybe Its just a waste of time, But I don't think so, Maybe I definately know, Why do I keep fooling myself, Why can't I let go, This is not like me, Maybe I definately see, That maybe, Maybe I'm in love... etc.  Sorry about that.
