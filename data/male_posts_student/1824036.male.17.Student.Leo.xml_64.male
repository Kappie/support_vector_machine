I decided to investigate and see who the frick was trying to burn down my house. I come downstairs and see my mom, my sister, and Brian (my sisters boyfriend) all eating pancakes. Brian was cooking. They were pretty good I thought. But apparently he must have gotten bored, for when I came downstairs, there was a pancake with my initials in it. Then I proceeded with my odd ritual of toppings. First the butter, then the Peanut Butter, then the syrup (we had no powdered sugar out). I ate the pancakes and thanked Brian while my sister insulted me by calling me names like stupid, moron, weirdo, etc. (keep in mind that my sister is 17)
