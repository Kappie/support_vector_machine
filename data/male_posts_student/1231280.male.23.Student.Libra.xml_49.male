I promise you will leave satisfied. As for my day today, it was OK. First, I had to do something about the Sociology class I was trying to get into. I had FINALLY (after a week) heard back from one professor I wanted to take it from and he couldn't do it. (FYI: This class I'm tyring to get in is an independent study sociolgy research class.) So, I hopped on campus today to try to find a faculty member who would do it with me. I couldn't find anyone. Well, that's beacuse the department was barren. So, I took the initiative to e-mail the head of the department to see if he knew of anyone willing to teach it over the summer, or shit, if he wanted to do it for me.   This is what I e-mailed to him. My editorial notes will be placed in these "[]". Names have been changed.   Professor Tillson-   My name is Brandon Sieckman and I am a senior who just recently changed my major to Sociology. I had sociology minor with my former major, and I am looking to graduate in Spring of 05.    The past few weeks I have been searching for a faculty member to help with complete a SOC 698 over the summer. I contacted Professor Gonny [ the one who took a week to get back to me ] and unfortunatley, he was busy. I am now looking for another faculty member who would be willing to help me complete this. I contacted you because I thought maybe you would know of anyone who was doing this with other students this summer, or perhaps, you would be interested as well. If you know of anyone who I could get in contact with, I would be grateful - completeing this over the summer would help my semester loads next year be a smidge lighter. Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing form you.   Regards, Brandon Sieckman sieckman@ku.edu       Well, after I wrote this, I found out from my advisor that I didn't need that class because: A) It wouldn't count towards my degree and B) I didn't need as many 300-plus level classes as I thought I did.   This is the { Sarcasm Alert }  ABSOLUTLEY LOVELY  { End Sarcasm Alert } e-mail I recieved back from him.   Well Brandon, this is why these things should be arranged ahead of time.  Faculty are listed in the time-table as available for SOC698 in the summer to permit them to carry these credits only if they have agreed to do so. They are not actually paid over the summer.   SOC698 is reserved for students who have worked closely with a professor and are engaged in:  "Library or field research either as part of an ongoing project or as an independent study project.  Prerequisite: Two courses in sociology and consent of instructor."  Like most faculty, I generally do not complete a SOC698 unless I have had a student in class and they have performed in such a way as to merit consideration.  I am willing to discuss this with you, however.  I have office hours on TU-TR 1.30-3.00.  Come prepared with a copy of your ARTS form and a proposal for what you plan to do for these SOC698 credits.    WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR?  You totally bitched me out about approaching you about this, and then you said you would help me do it. Do you honestly think that I would want to do it with you after you just said that shit to me? You know what? I have three words for you:   GO FUCK YOURSELF!    OK, now that we have that out the way, we can move on to better things.   For those of you who have been away from the KC Metro scene lately, Standford  Sons in Westport is turning into Johnny Dare's. Yes, the Morning DJ.

There are little "0 Comments" buttons at the end of every post. Click on it and leave me some love. I work semi-hard on this thing to entertain you people, so leave me some love, bitches.  OK...more fun...I thought this was kind of interesting...     MMMMMMM, MMMMMMMMMM, bitch!   Ok...more fun...this is what your girlfriend wants for christmas this year...     (Cheesey comedy drum thingy goes here)  Well, that's all I have for today kids. Before I go, I want to leave you with a quote from the late, great Ronald Reagan.  "Republicans act like every day is the 4th of July. Democrats act like every day is April 15th."  God bless you Ronnie and may you rest in peace.      Have a good one and well talk to you all real soon. Take care of yourselves.  -B
