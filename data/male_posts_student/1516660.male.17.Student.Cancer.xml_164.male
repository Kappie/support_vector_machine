I spent about 20k buying a Faerie Pen and Faerie Notebook. Then, I tutored her A-Maths. We went throught Sets and Functions, and I gave her homework (5 questions on each topic). I am quite hesistant about giving her homework, because I never do the homework my tuition teacher gave me. She insisted that I give her some questions, so oh well.   After the tuition, we went online. Now, we met WQ there (his nick is: "Shout. Scream. Do what you want!" Oh! We inferred what that meant....). Now, I pretened to be Wendy and talked to him (oh my! i broke my own rules...but never mind. I am talking as "Wendy"). I wonder if he knew the difference. Probably he forgot how KY talks like le....so long never chatted with me le. And he sent Wendy an email, the one which I tried so hard to fill for Ben. Just for fun, I wrote a lot of sarcarstic answers in the boxes (oh my! I am becoming more and more sarcarstic these days!). Then, I seriously considered sending to him. But Wendy made me send to myself instead. Ha! Meow!  After that, watched some funny cartoons. My Little Ponies and Rainbow Brite. So cute! Then, we went to 888 to eat dinner. Wendy's mom ate mixed rice, Wendy ate chicken chop rice and I ate fried carrot cake plus sotong. I brought BBQ Chicken Wings Rice for brother. Yeah.  Oh my! I have diarrhea! I think it is the lontong I ate this morning for breakfast. So idiotic you know! Rushing to the toilet every hour or so. I hope I don't have diarrhea tomorrow. I certainly don't want to be rushing to the toilet every few hours!!   Okay, I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow blog! It's gonna be an exciting day. Fixing puzzles and baking cakes! HaHa! Goodnight!
