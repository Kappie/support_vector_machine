Anyway, they have a mod on there called BinSlayer which is where you can only use the sniper rifle but it shoots modified bullets at a very high rate(the speed of the gatling gun) and they have splash damage. The speed on the server is 170% I think and quad jump is enabled and low gravity is turned on. This particular server plays mostly maps that are rooms of the house, like the living room, the kitchen, the backyard, the bunkbed with another room attached. All the maps are very large to take advantage of the low gravity and the quad jumping.  The BinSlayer mod was created when the hunt for Bin Laden started. It's a really fast style of gameplay and takes some time to get use to. You can't stay on the ground. You must time your jumps perfectly so that you can pretty much fly across the map. To stay alive you must keep your health up with shields and get 199 health.  The BallzOut clan is very good but I'm getting a little better. Good enough to get at least one kill per round against the best of them.
