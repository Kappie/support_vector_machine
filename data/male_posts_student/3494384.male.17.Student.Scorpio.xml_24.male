Damn tired. Slept for 5 hours only today. How less can it get?  Just found out recently that I cant mix well with people. And also why all my friends all like leave me le... Why? If this persists, all my friends will be gone...  Ya... Noreply. 2 days le.Countingdown seems useless le. Saturday is approaching. No mood. Dont want to think about it.   No friends, no reply from ******, uncompleted project. Life sucks.  I wonder how long will I got to endure such...
