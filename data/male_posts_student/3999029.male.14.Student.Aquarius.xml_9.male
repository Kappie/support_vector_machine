Some bitches were also there training and gave out a fucking survey abt fucking stuff for ppl to do. They are also damn noisy, fuck, I hate bitches. Wanted to play LAN but too many ppl there so went home with bo xuan. Talked abt house of flying daggers with him. He says the movie is damn nice, will watch it when I get back the DVD.  Watched Troy today at home on my new DVD player. It totally sucks like hell. The movie is damn boring and the scenes at the back were especially dark and crowded and I don noe what is going on.   Oops, forget to post yesterday cos of the national day holiday. Happy 39th Birthday Singapore! That's all, I have nothing much to say. Fux! Pray for the death of Coach Zhang.
