The way Dead Prez is acting right now confuses me quite a bit, and I'm assuming it's all that weed that's go to their heads.  Whatever, I ain't tryin' to understand that one.  On a more down to earth note, Nia has arrived home today.  How exciting, we went out and ate Mexican food as a result.  Yum.  Now everything is more or less back to normal.  Nia adjust to being back in the suburbs quite well.
