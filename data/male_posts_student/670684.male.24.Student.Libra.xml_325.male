If Baudrillarian, or Baudrillard, is a foreign name or concept to you, I demand that you pick up SIMULACRA ET SIMULATION from your local bookstore, by author Jean Baudrillard.  The most dense read that you'll ever take part in, no matter what your education level.  But a wonderful theorist who is shunned by just about everyone for his views on hyperreality, which is less of a theory and more of a truth in today's society.    Anyway, Baudrillard's work can't be boiled down, but here's the crux of many of his arguments:   It used to be that television was a mirror of society, that what appeared on screen was based on what was happening in the world.  But with the rise of the telecommunications industry, the importance that advertising and PR put on media, and the semblance of power aligning themselves as favorably with media as possible, the case now is that  society mirrors television .   Never easy to prove, as theories are theories and not facts...human insight isn't something that is easy to duplicate in a lab setting.  But as I drove Austin looking for used CD shops and/or used musical instrument arenas, 101X decided to play Spacehog's one hit, a name that I can't remember...but the chorus has the words  with lands so green, and skies so blue ...and that song always reminds me of high school in Rogers, AR.    Thing is, I can remember where that memory came from.  I was at home during Spring Break 1995, and MTV was doing a small bit about their past Spring Break excursions.  And the song they capped for Spring Break 1994 was Spacehog's.  And all the hardbodies were in their bikinis, waving at the camera, ready to do things that night that I didn't imagine people did.  And I wanted to be a part of it because things were happening there...that was the center of the universe, because it was on MTV and they were making such a grandiose deal about it, and friends of mine were talking about it, specifically Kyle McNitt (that Spacehog song is also the Kyle McNitt song, as he proposed to love it, and I never pegged Kyle as the alt rock type).  And whenever that song came on, I thought of how great Spring Break must have been in the Keys, or Cozumel, or wherever they were doing it this year.    And today, almost ten years removed from sitting on that old couch on New Hope Road, eating Mac Cheese and loathing in my home, the song just reminds me of Rogers, and how I did enjoy myself there.    But that's not really the point here.  The point is that MTV started doing Spring Break on location, to tepid response.  And then in 1995, they started airing all sorts of promos for their annual Spring Break somewhere else, and showing how great it was, and to a target audience too young and mostly too far to take part in any of it, they created our Fucking Disneyland.  And for us, when we got to that age, our desire was to be a part of it.    I've never done it.  Got friends who did.  They enjoyed it, kind of.  Not drunk enough to throw themselves at women with forceful words and hand-related gestures.  But it wasn't them.  And that bothered them...because from their perspective, it was supposed to be them.    A screenplay about a manwhore some day, maybe...manwhore of course just as terrible a word as metrosexual.  About A Boy did a good job of looking after it, but it was in a very friendly, warm way...I'm interested in the Day of Reckoning, when people have to wake up and realize who they are, what they've become, and how the fuck did it happen?    The song after Spacehog was Offspring's new one HIT THAT.  I'll admit right now, I'm a huge mark for Offspring.  Always have been.  Catchy vocals, great voice, good backbeat to it.
