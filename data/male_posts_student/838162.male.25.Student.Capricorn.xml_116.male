Completely revamp the service, including new templates that meet all the latest standards. Boy does it save me alot of time but it does force the need to implement changes like well...now.  This template is only a placeholder for the moment, I quite like it but think I will need to add my own touches to it soon, like a little less blue. Of course the old tag-board and comments are gone. No big lost really. The tag-boards keep crashing and having pop-up appear and the comments were practically unused. Will be using the new Blogger comments system but I don't think I'll be putting the tag-board back.  As for the profile, writting page and links. I will work to getting them up as soon as I can. Lots of stuff to adjust and learn. Would be fun if I didn't already have some stuff on hand to do.
