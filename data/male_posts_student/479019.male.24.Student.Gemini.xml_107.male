There lots of nifty advertisements from that decade. I thought this motor oil ad was hilarious and wrong at the same time. It just looks weird with a dad and his kid sitting on their car watching soldiers go by.  I did manage to pick up Alkaline Trio tickets for the 16th at the Troubadour. That should be fun and entertaining.  I'm kind of hungry right now. I'm think I'll get something to eat.  **
