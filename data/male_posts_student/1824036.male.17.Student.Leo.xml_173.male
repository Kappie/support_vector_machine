The ratings were 1 to 5 and 5 is a DQ...they tell you pretty much you suck and you dont get squat. 1 is awesome and you can have a cookie. The judges never seem to give out 4's and guess what...we got a 3.  Not good..not bad...but we could have done better. Oh well...there is next year. Then we arent with the crappy freshmen!!!
