Picked out a few favourites like skyineurophia and shoesize9. Hah, now i have a better impression on local underground music, mats have plenty of talents. Anyway, after that i went tuh get some vodka for her, then surprisingly, very surprising, she invited me over. woah. haha locked outta my house. doh. Well, i helped her on loci, but i according to the tys answers i got none of them correct, but hey at least i tried?! :D o well, left around 12.30 or something...cos her eyes were red and i could tell that she was sleepy. Thats all for today, cheers.
