Spent the whole hour trying to not do too much work, and hit my head against the keyboard/screen several times too. Let out late (again) so missed a fair chunk of English. Which didn't matter 'cos we didn't really do anything anyways. French...interesting. We had Ms Hovland as a supply, so naturally no real work was done, apart from finding random French words then insulting Sam with them. Science...again, interesting. Uncie Phil's WILF and WALT lists are getting v. annoying, but his willingless to let us play with those mini-whiteboards needs good comment. Of course, Jack and Bish kinda went crazy with classic messages like "Jack blows rabbits" "I'm with stupid" "Bish for men" "Nat say yes" among other things. And no good day would be complete without History, where we found out we're gonna be getting cake next lesson. Woo-hooooooo!  Then comes the fun part. The last few group games and finals of the SVJBC doubles tournament! Me and partner James Jones (one of a few friendly yr 10s) went and beat the bejeez out of Andy Craig and James McWilliam (the #1 seeds) 15-6, then beat some other people by 15-7 to get through into the semis. Semis, we beat Pete *the hair #2* Heath and Jamie Thomas 15-11 to get into the final against Andy and James. At one point, we were 10-3 down, but we pulled back and won 15-11.  Very  fast and tiring. Better roller coaster than the ones at Disney World if you ask me. =D  So yeah, I got this: http://botprojectx.topcities.com/woohoo.jpg and its still kinda kahrayzee that I won. And I'm in such a good mood I  might  go ask Nat tomorrow. That'd be the icing on the cake...mmmmm....cake....
