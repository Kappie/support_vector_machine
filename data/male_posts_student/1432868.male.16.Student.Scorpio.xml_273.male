This is our final concert and is featuring our seniours who are leaving very soon. Graduation will be June 1st  and well I can't imagine some of my classes without some of the seniors. I mean what's music theory without Sara Sankey? :-P oops I'll rant some more after the concert. Off to change into my Tux
