The writer is a journalist who happens to serve in the guard, and has just finished a one year rotation in Iraq.  He is now posting his journal entries, one per day, of his experiences in Iraq.  Take some time each day to keep up with this, and see the things the mainstream media doesn't cover - what REALLY happened in Iraq on the ground.
