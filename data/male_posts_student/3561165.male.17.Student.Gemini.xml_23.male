These laws are ridiculous and illiberal. They, in simple terms, stipulate that persons aged under eighteen years are not permitted to be on the streets after the hour of 10 o'clock and their parents are prosecutable if this legislation is transgressed. They reasoning behind this is that prior to the predication of this law, the streets were a lawless jungle of teenagers who were unfettered in, and prone to breaking the law. This law makes a number presuppositions which I shall detail and disassemble here:  1) Persons under the age of eighteen are prone to breaking the law and are more likely to break the law than persons of an older age. 2) Thus this law insinuates that it is acceptable to cut the civil liberties of an especial demographic, if this demographic is particularly likely to break the law. 3) Persons under the age of eighteen are irresponsible and thus cannot be prosecuted for their own actions. 4) Thus persons under the age of eighteen are unequal citizens with a different set of rights and responsibility than their elders. 5) Ultimately, concerns raised by presuppositions 2 and 4 repudiate each other in that because persons under the age of eighteen are essentially unequal in the eyes of the law, it does not effect their overall position if some of their non-fundamental rights are cut; in other words they do not have the responsibilities so they should not have the rights.  Okay, I'm sure that many people, and this includes myself, appreciate the fact that the streets of Sunnyvale are a much safer place than prior to the imposition of this curfew. However, Laws of this kind are, as I stated earlier illiberal in their nature and merely lead to indignation and ire among those who are discriminated against by these laws, even if they have superficial benefits. The laws criminalise an entire section of the population without any founding or criminal action besides presence; it has been determined in courts of Law at many junctures that presence cannot constitute a crime. Detractors of my stance would say that because I do not have the responsibilities, I do not deserve the legal rights. I find this to be a very immature stance; it is quite clear that from the age of fourteen or fifteen (in British law with which I am familiar the age of the inception criminal liability is eleven) it is possible for criminal intension to be formed and therefore with this capacity comes the capacity for criminal liability and responsibility.  Indeed, this country of the USA has imposed criminal responsibility to those under the age of eighteen and has carried out death sentences on those under the age of eighteen at the time of the comission of the crime (in transgression of international human rights treaties, but all the same) and then is reticent in allowing persons under the age of eighteen to, in the eyes of the Law to have the same rights as those aged over eighteen, to whom the same responsibilities are (generally) imposed is extremely hypocritical. This country is built upon the premise of equal rights for all, and I quote (from paragraph 2 of the declaration of Independence):  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"  Contrast this statement with the aforementioned curfew law and it becomes fairly unequivocal that this Law is wrong in that persons with equally responsibilities in terms of criminality are not given equal rights.  Therefore, it is clear to me that the best course of pursuit for areas plagued by misbehaviour of a few is to prosecute them for their crimes and not illegitimately punish the innocent. Preventative laws such as this are merely reactionary and in this sense are very dangerous and illiberal. It is a shame that laws such as this can be formulated, by reactionary politicians serving the cause of the miopic mildly-conservative majority. In particular regard to this Law, it is because childrens and young adults interests and grossly under-represented on a political level in Britain and in the United States. With the exception of childrens charities (NSPCC, etc) and pressure groups they get no representation because they are inelligible for election. I am not stating that children should be able to win election to bodies of Government, I am merely saying that Government's and Governmental positions should take childrens interests more to heart, they are after all part of the populace. The fact that they do not have the vote means that politicians and candidates do not need to win their support, and this in turn leads to disengagement. Again, I am not saying that it would be, for reason immaterial to my point, pertinent to confer the vote to people under the age of sixteen or eighteen, I am just saying that elected official should merely listen to the voices of the unrepresented majority among this demographic before making reactionary laws.  Anyway, in closure I hope you agree that laws of this sort are pretty Machiavellian and stuff. All I, and many others like me expects is parity with those aged above me in terms of both rights and responsibilities in the eyes of the Law. If those with criminal liability (in this case, in British law, those aged 11-17, and the equivalent in American law and so forth) behave in a law-abiding fashion, they should be treated with respect, if they are not then the full weight of the law should come down upon them. If you got this far, thanks for reading, I didn't really intend this to be for everyone's digestion, I was just venting my opinion on something which I feel is very unjust.
