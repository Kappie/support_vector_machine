Mom is cookin somethin and it smells soooo good.  oh and its been raining off and on today... its lovely.  if i had it my way then it would only be sunny maybe 2 days of the week.. the rest would need to be rainy... with an occaisonal storm.  ha... in my dreams.  yase.  well... i'm kinda hungry so i shall set off in search of food.  au revoir.     my iTunes  >>   urlLink If I Ain't Got You (Acoustic Exclusive)
