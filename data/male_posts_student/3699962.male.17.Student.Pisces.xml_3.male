But everyone's moved on.  I checked out Christopher's blog yesterday. He's moved on. I checked out Adel's... It's not sure if she has but I think she would have already, seeing as she's taking her A's this year and all. Amiirah has, her display picture's no longer of the Pre-U Sem group. Not that that's a big sign. Rachel too, she moved on the day she came back... Had to play for mass. Even my "darrrling" haha... Jeremy... He's busy mugging. Don't know if he's moved on, but yeah. I'm not blaming them, not gonna, cause we'll all move on sometime. If not sooner, later.  But what happened to the 'Dont lose touch'-s and the 'Dont let it fade'-s? Did they mean nothing? Boy does that suck. And poor gullible me still thought it wouldn't happen. Well it did. Apparently.  Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm just being an idiot. Maybe I shouldn't have placed so much hope in such a thing to start with. The only reason I placed so much hope in it was cause they gave me such security. Don't ask me how, but they did. Sigh.  My security should be in God. Not people, not things. Missing my Pre-U Sem mates heaps   Security - Stacy Orrico +  Another day, all alone again Someone please love me Another game, another broken heart Why do I do this to myself  I could look and try to find someone Who won't leave me lonely But then I found I didn't need to search Cause You were the one and You came to me  You fought for my heart and You have won it You're taking me over and I like that I tried other love but couldn't feel it I'm so glad you found me because  I need you so close to me Cause You're the only one that makes my life complete Oh Lord, I know that it took so long to see That You're my security You won't go away from me And now I know that I don't ever have to worry Cause my heart feels so very free You're my security...   Moving on and changing it up, Sherm, better known as Sir Germy. Hehe.
