Enjoy the humour of the situation: There's a province where the Liberal vote went up and where Liberal MPs held their own.  And there's a province where the Liberal vote went down and where a large number of Liberal MPs were beaten by Conservatives.  The place where Liberals held their own, of course, is Alberta. The place where Liberals posted losses, of course, is Ontario.  It is reassuring to note that Alberta separatists are no brighter than their cousins in Quebec.   Wells has sometimes shown a preference for cleverness over logical thought, and this is such a case.   So Martin was slightly less repulsive to Albertans than was Jean Chretien. So what? Certainly, the Liberals "held their own" in Alberta, but "their own" included a startlingly non-whopping 2 seats. And even this isn't cast in stone: David Kilgour's slim win is, as we speak, going to a recount. And anyway, as every real Albertan knows, Edmonton, where McLellan and Kilgour are from, is not really Alberta.   Bzzzzzzzt. Try again, Paul.
