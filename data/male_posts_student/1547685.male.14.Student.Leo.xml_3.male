Thats why im bored b/c i cant bare to watch it anymore. Well the last couple of days have been the same for me except for today when i was in the media center. I had to take a test and i took me the WHOLE time to do only 16 problems and also i still had one that i didnt finish so thats probably going to be wrong. Also, right now im soooooooooo scared b/c i have a really hard english test on the Red Badge of Courage tomorrow and i need to study really hard. I think ill use some notes at http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/redbadge/study.html. I hope they'll help me out but if you look at this site then DO NOT take the quiz b/c its really wacked. I think ill go study now b/c the Sharks are still losing 4-2. Ill blog on a better day. byebye
