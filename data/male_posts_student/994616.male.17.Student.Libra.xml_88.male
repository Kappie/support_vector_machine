That's impossible. That would ntotally never happen. ITS A MOVIE, DAMNIT. if anythinng hapens that can't wont shouldn't or couldn't then it was the magic movie magic, yes magic movie magic, not regular movie magic. I'm not entirely sure if it's the job of the director or the audiance for this little thing called 'suspension of disbeliefe' but i htink the audiance has a little something to do with it, or at least laugh at the lookey monkeys quietly...  Saw tomb raider tongiht, and LXG last night. if i saw tomb raider alone (like not afer LXG) i would have liked it, its the type of aqdventure movie i love, you know the type of movie that LXG is. except LXG has some awesome special effects, and skinner has an incredibly sexy accent, i'm moving to liverpool... NOW *waves*  Apparently Gerard Butler is to play the lead in the movie adaptation of the phantom of the opera, as directed by Joel shumacher. Damn why joel schumacher? sure phone book was good, and  A Time To Kill wasn't bad either, but let me just say Batman forever and then batman and robin... yes.... i'm sorry too, no i can't do anything. anyways this is the new lead for the fantom of the opera:  Damn i can't find a better shot of him :    1 Up Shroom to: Skinner's Accent  Poisoned Shroom to: lack of suspended disbelief...
