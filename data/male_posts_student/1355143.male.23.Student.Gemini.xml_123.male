(pics should be coming along shortly)  i am also one block away from ground zero. i walk by it every day, it is really weird, i get this spooky feeling every time i look in there.  you know what else is really weird.  3 cops on every corner with machine guns. as you might have heard, they also just raised the alert level here from yellow (low) to orange (high) for the financial district here in nyc. whatever that means.  what a silly system, i think it is designed just so they can claim there was either an orange alert or a high alert, depending on whether anything happens.  so, celicia is here and lee as well, if anyone remembers either of them.  i think i will meet up with them this weekend so they can show me around.  peace for now peeps.  -walker  urlLink wromanica@gmail.com  ps. i love my new gmail. i dont care if they know everything about me.
