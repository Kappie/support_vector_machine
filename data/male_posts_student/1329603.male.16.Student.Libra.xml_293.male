Got on with Meg and Aynsley well, as could be expected, got on OK with Emily for the first couple of days then she seemed to shy away a bit, got on with Bradley and the 2 Chrisses far better than I'd expected and was shocked to find that I was talking to Matt McDade rather a lot. Miller got H-A-M-M-E-R-E-D. I was very sensible, I had about 2 beers a night. No drunkeness for me. As a result I got a bit isolated, as shown by myself going into my room and headbanging along to Sonata Arctica on the last night. We played well, I managed to on the whole avoid the majority of sunburn, and I constantly felt like stealing Aynsley and going to live with her in a small house somewhere. For she is fun. All in all, the tour was good, despite a complete lack of me pulling. Not that that was ever my intention. But yeah, was cool... can't think of much more about Holland.  The orchestra course... was unusual. Got on with lots of people but no-one spectacularly well. Late nights were commonly spent by Dave Smith, Digby and myself talking about things in one of the rooms. Met a gorgeous girl called Beth who apparently is slightly more free with herself than I'd like but she was part of the contingent who thought I was hot (don't ask)... I let it slip away, I wouldn't have been able to trust that she wasn't already going out with someone. Ate a rather large amount of Galaxy, sucked at bowling (but ruled on the Dance game, I got an A on Standard ^_^), played the trombone a lot, sang a bit, did a couple of duets and made the orchestra piss themselves when I did the optional narration in one of the practices for "Star Trek through the years". Can now also read alto clef, which is a bonus. Got on with Sam a lot better than I'd thought I would have done (that is, she didn't attempt to stab me), and as a result was quite pleased with that. I spent a lot of time feeling very much the outsider but why change the habit of a lifetime? The times when I was involved fully in the social life I tended to make everyone piss themselves so... I don't know, I think I came off  pretty well. Last night we (Jed, Burt, Dave, Digby, Ellis, Joel and I) stayed up eating Pringles, talking, and doing comic things with cream (Dave spurted all over my face shortly after Jed let loose on my groinal region of my trousers). I did my impression  of Hitler doing his NÃ¼rnberg speech  in Swedish  and did the Star Trek narration with the volume control buggered (as in "Sp..ce... th... al... t...er" etc.) and 'twas all in fun. Met Phil Cowley's daughter. She's nice, in both meanings. Too good at the trumpet. There were 8 of them. Far too many. Anyway, yeah, the Orchestra Course was a barrel of laughs but I'm also quite glad to be away and back to sanity for a while.  You may have noticed that in both weeks I had a kind of running theme of trying to score... it's kinda because I'm trying to kinda... 'slide', I guess. Just... I don't think, even if I was about to score, that I could. I'd feel guilty somehow, like it'd be against common decency for me to do so. I don't know how long I'm going to keep myself single for. The problem is that I know why I'm doing it, so it's harder to stop it.  Quote of the day: "So you think you can stone me, And spit in my eye? So you think you can love me, And leave me to die?"
