So for this post, I wanna share with you some random facts I've picked up over the years:  The word "Typewriter" is the longest word you can write it with one row on a keyboard.  Meg White of the White Stripes doesn't enjoy wearing white or red aside from playing shows.  In 5-card poker, the odds of getting a "Royal Flush" are 1 to 649,740.  Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon was with his left foot.  Guitarist; Jimi Hendrix would hid LSD underneath a head-bandana, so the LSD would hit his bloodstream faster going through his pours.  E=MC2  Okay, I'm getting bored with this, and I'm sure you are. I'll have some more stuff up later today.  Keep on checking back here. I'm almost at 200-hits this month! I'm cutting close.
