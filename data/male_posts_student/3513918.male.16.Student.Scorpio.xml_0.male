Well, woke up at 615 this morning(the usual school day time) and was quite sleepy.. Perhaps had a late night ehz? Well, had a conference with weixian and joycelyn for two and a half hours according to weixian.. It was fun and interesting though.. Weixian played the guitar at 1st, then joycelyn took out hers to play as well.. As I don't have a guitar and didn't know how to play, I became the audience haha.. Joycelyn sang too and her voice was very sweet.. And well if ya had read weixian's blog, you would know that something had happened.. Well, there are obstacles in our life which are meant to be overcomed and we grow and learn from them.. So we should just take things in our own stride.. and be happy always(though it may seem impossible).. However, no harm trying it as well right? Why torment yourself when you can enjoy yourself instead? These philosophies may seem too exaggerated, but it can be attained.. though not always.. Well, today stayed back after school to do my "O" levels art final piece as the deadline is closing in soon.. And oh yeah.. weiqiang today don't know why came to my school and joined me in the art room.. haha but there was amyrul and me in my class and the rest were sec 4s.. Yeah.. and after that went back home, ate my dinner.. Then around 8+ weixian came to my house use com bahx.. Use until 10pm den we go for our usual running and exercise.. haha must maintain and be constant.. if not waste our previous efforts le.. hehe.. overall quite a jubilant day today for me bahx.. nothing bad happened.. :) haha oh well, good night and rest.. my soul mate..
