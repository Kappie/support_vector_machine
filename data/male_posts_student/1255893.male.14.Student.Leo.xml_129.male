We headed to work w/ my dad for a while and chilled @ in n out for lunch. Got to bond w/ mommy for a while which isnt something we normally get to do. Went to thrift ...... excuse me ... RITE AID , to pick up a few random thingies. I got myself this clearasil acne wash thingy which is also gonna help me exfoliate! wo0t! Thank ya kyan! btw . watch queer eye tuedays @ 10 on bravo! Once home my dad fixed up a few snacks and we all settled down to watch kill bill again. Such an awesome movie! Now Lj's gone off w/ friends to whore around the valley. I'm left here in the room listenin to these 1099 mp3's he gave me.   i began to listen to "the boys of summer" by the ataris. I wanted to look up the lyrics cus i aint sure bout all of em. I got to bout the 2nd verse and i was like "hey this remeinds me of sum'n" .... beffore i go on lemme show ya what it says so we can understand eachother a lil bit better:   I never will forget those nights I wonder if it was a dream Remember how you made me crazy? Remember how I made you scream Now I don't understand what happened to our love But babe, I'm gonna get you back I'm gonna show you what I'm made of  I can see you- Your brown skin shinin' in the sun I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone  Out on the road today, I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You can never look back." I thought I knew what love was What did I know? Those days are gone forever I should just let them go but-     Well it's probably obvious to a few ppl by now. ive had Ave on my mind a lot more than usual lately and .... well... i dunno.  while listening to lyrics i usually picture some kind of story in my head. All that was flashing was the end of the party where last i saw her. "I'm gonna show you what I'm made of" .... hmm, that could imply a lot of things. Don't immediatly assume what all you horny lil kids probably think when u 1st hear that. Anywho, the whole "when i get you back part" im jus sayin to myself ... " jus 20 something more days ... 20 something days..." Then comes the  "don't look back..." thing. To tell the truth i kinda agree. you can't look back to escape what you feel NOW. I say apply what was to what is so you can look back by moving forward, cus or else you get stuck in a rut and you won't feel better. but thatas jus me.   ONE MORE THING! seeing as there's only about 24 hours left anyways...... i wanna wisha  happy happy birthday to haress!!!! I WUV YA MAN! your school choice was wrong cus ur makin us miss you way too damn much man! us cleveland babies want ya here w/ us! oh man we're lame. but hey, happy birthday man. MANY MORE! :-D L8R
