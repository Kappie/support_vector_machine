Not to mention Jonathan being so gay. that on a scale of 1 to 10, he is very gay.  Living Skills was weird this year cause there were 4928490280 people on the panel. And there were these two hot guys who I ran into downtown. "Hey, it's the gay Paly guy!" "Hey, it's the bisexual Foothill guys!" Good stuff. I should write a book.  I want to kill Jenny and Wilhelm. Not only are they both really sexy, but then they have the audacity to dry hump on MY bed. MINE! You at least let me have a piece.  Let's all throw rocks at the newest addition to my links page, Giboc. I made a poem about him a few days ago, let's see if I can find it.

I'm still a big fan of the Giboc poem, but god damn. I like to think my tolerance for certain people has gone down to more appropriate levels. Of course I now am a gay guy at Foothill, and have disowned all GSAs ever. Yay!
