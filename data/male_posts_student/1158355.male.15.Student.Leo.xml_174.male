Today was awesome, it was a snowday. I woke up and my dad made me get in the shower and I tried to convince him that there was no school but he didn't believe me and right when I got out of the shower, he said NO SCHOOL, that bastard. But the hot shower actually made me fall asleep even faster and I had a great 11 hour sleep, waking up at 10:30. I watched "Look Who's Talking," then got THE CALL from Pat saying I'd get the HAND UP THE ASS CALL from Jimmy, and sure enough, I got that call also, and boy was I exilerated, fullclemped, flamboyant, flam tap also. You know what, I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. I went snow funning with Dan, Pat, Jimmy, Eric, Mal, Gavin, Matt, Chris, and I think that was it. We went to the sump, played tag on the ice, attempted to go in the manhole sump thingy but it was all water in it and we got soaked, had snowball wars, killed each other masterbate but then got reancarnated just in time for fun at Jimmy's. We played air hockey, Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64!!! It was a shitload of fun. The whole day was on the whole, a blast! So kids, get your funits today for all boys and toys. Made by Patrick Olsen, corperations aren't for sale, see details on box, munchos aren't included. You ever wonder what the hell those little shits are saying at the end of commercials? Me too. I don't want to go to school tomorrow, I'm gonna be all tired and sleepy until lunch, then I get hyper. What will happen this weekend, nobody knows. But one things for sure, I must attend my homework now. Wait...this Just In (Schreck or Timberlake), right now, my sister is running around the house in circles screaming, so I must do my job, neutralize the threat. 143 bffl xoxoxo ox...horns. PEACE OUT
