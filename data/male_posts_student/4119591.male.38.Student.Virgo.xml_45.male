Anyway, occasionally I get an email from parties interested in linking to my site and, after blacklisting their address, I go on with my life as if nothing happened. Usually this mail comes from those link-building services that aim to increase visitors to a site by linking yours to others. I don't give a flying poo about how many people visit my site; the whole operation seems a waste of time.   Most recently (about an hour ago, actually) I received just such an email. The author thought that I might want to provide a link to and perhaps a review of a "related" wood-working web site. You know, because I do a lot of wood-working and I post about all of my latest creations with the lathe and the plainer and the orthogonal reciprocating crosscut in-line band saw and stuff. The truth of the matter is that I haven't once mentioned "wood-working" or "wood" and I seldom like to talk about "working" at all.   This guy's site claims that his messages aren't SPAM because there's no commercial gain involved. But I have to wonder what is the point of increasing clicks and face time for a site if it isn't commercial? Ponderous. ...blacklisted! (Whew, that took a little longer than usual.)
