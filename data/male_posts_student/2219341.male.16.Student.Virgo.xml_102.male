"i am so tired of the tears shed at night"...Drew i still cry...even though i know God will make it ok...and i am not ashamed of it.  maybe it will prove to so many people that my feelings are real and not mere shadows...  ELLEN HESTER YOU RUINED 5 PIZZA'S!  ok maybe 4 since Ashley did burn that other one...BUT STILL!  and i didnt "squeal" everytime you messed one up!  hahahaha!  yes i did look pretty good in that apron didnt i! lol!    goodnight my dearest friends...
