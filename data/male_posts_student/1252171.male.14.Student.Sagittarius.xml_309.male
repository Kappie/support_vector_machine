I expect presents *shakes fist, DC backs away more*.) Here's a going away gift. It's not material, so I understand if you hate me for the rest of eternity *mimes tear, DC backs away yet again*.  Oh, crap, where did I leave off? Hmmm... oh, right. Ahem:  You see, since Knumchuck was blind, his other senses got stronger ("*coughDaredevilripoffcough*" "Shut it!"). And he could "see" who the person was ("*coughlawsuitcough*" "I said SHUT IT!!"). It was a female echidna with blue hair, wearing a dress. But, for the sake of my storytelling skills, he didn't tell anyone.  THE NEXT DAY!  Knumchuck wakes up, and when he gets up first thing in the morning, his powers don't work too well. The other day he stuck a Pop-tart in a blender and tried to make a fruit smoothie with the toaster. Today, he accidentally shoved cereal into his nose. But none of that has anything to do with the storyline. I just added it in for length. So he's walking down the street and (WARNING! STORY LENGTHENER AHEAD!) trips over a manhole cover with the initials "FW" on it. He opens it and sees me effortlessly typing away at my computer. So he notices a female echidna with blue hair and a blue dress walking down the street carrying a large bag of groceries and a blazing red bird on her sholder. She loses her balance and almost drops her groceries, had it not been for Knumchuck who saved them at the last second. "Thanks," said the blue-haired echidna. "Hey, it's the least, and I mean the least, I could do for the person who saved me and my friend's lives," Knumchuck answers. "You knew that was me?" "Of course I did. I don't have these super senses for nothing. 'Cept today. I shoved cereal up my nose and it temporarily impaired my sense of smell." "Hehehehe. My name's Pheen. Pheen Niks. This is my pet bird Pheonix." "I'm Knumchuck. Nice to meet you."   TEH END!!!  -Sane Intolerant-
