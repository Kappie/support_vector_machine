Oh well. *sighs*  Heh, first time I read through Laura's blog and she was saying about wanting to be with a musician who was in a local band, that kind of drew my attention nicely. Turns out it was someone called Chris, but I can dream.  Oh, got the results of my Les Mis audition..... I'M DOING MARIUS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Anyway, also, probably meeting up with Laura on Saturday. How cool is that? We're probably going to spend almost the entire time having a chat in Ottakars... meh, for me, that's more of a coolness x 4 type thing than something that's going to deteriorate it. Meeting Laura. Yay!  Got Sally's email address. You know how that one pans out. She gave me the wrong addy, didn't she? Bloody hell. I guessed at what she'd said about her address, she copied it down wrong. Argh, though. Before you people that fancy me (I'm talking to YOU, brick wall) have a heart attack; I'm not asking her out, I just need a way to keep in contact with her, cause she's helping me with the organisation. In theory.  Meeting Laura on Saturday ^O^. I'm also going to have the equivalent of a half day at school on Friday, cause no mocks for us, just music practicals. So, yay, go into Gloucester and deposit my thing about Work Experience into D, S + P. Luverly stuff.  Skiing tomorrow, yay. You have no idea how stressed I was getting about this light entertainment thing today at school though. I nearly cried. Seriously, I came close. The back of my eyes were stinging like mad.  Anyway, I'll try and post again later.  Quote of the day: "Phantom faces at the window, Phantom shadows on the floor, Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more..."  From   Empty Chairs at Empty Tables   from the musical   Les Mis√®rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
