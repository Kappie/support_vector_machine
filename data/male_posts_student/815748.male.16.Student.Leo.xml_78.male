And then I didn't use the rest of the time, because I thought I could use it to my favor another way: by joking with Ian so as to show off myself... I guess you had to be there.  Like my Adam Brody picture?  It's meant to make you think I'm him, like Loren's David Beckham.  Anyways, we watched this moderately funny movie where it's like these teens who are going on a date using everyday vocabulary and then all of a sudden this espion (spy) comes out with this magazine called "L'Observateur" with a little see-through window in it.  Not realistic.  So anyway, after the other two classes, I went to KFC with John, Jonny, Craig, and Dan Jung.  Loren showed up there with Pedophile McGee.  As Stephanie Kaplan might say, it was sooooooo cold.  Loren left his bag there; we're going to have to go back and get it.  So I was talking to Melody on the phone for a while, partially about my own exploits (romantic and otherwise), and how you can't love someone you see as ugly, and whether or not you have to want to procreate with someone to love them (I was on the pro-procreation side).  According to Melody, D-Day should be tomorrow (as it says in "upcoming events"), but then she said that she said that just because she thought it would be entertaining to watch.  Some of her comments can get annoying from time to time... not that one, but like saying that everyone hates me.  Ah, well, I guess I'll just brush them off; although trying to ignore remarks are like trying to wash stink off a monkey (not really, I just like farm-animal metaphors).  Here are a few quotes that happened today:  "Aw, crap, this is terrible for me! How am I going to launch myself?" ---Loren Chen  "I was not underneath you!" ---Jonny Kalow  About going after girls: "It'd be so much easier, but they have like feelings and crap." ---John Garabedian
