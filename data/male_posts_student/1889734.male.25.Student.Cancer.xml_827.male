Normal retail movies utilize two layers on the DVD (if you've ever watched a DVD movie, you noticed a slight hesitation about 2/3rd of the way through the movie while the player switches layers).  The dual-layer mode allows more data per disk, but consigned pirates to breaking movies into two DVDs while copying (or stripping out all the extra features to squeeze it to one disk).  Now pirates can stamp the copy out pristine.  Thieves rejoice - you know who you are.  Continue to make slaves of others...
