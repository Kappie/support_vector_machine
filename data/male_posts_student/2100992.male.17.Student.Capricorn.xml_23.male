Then we split into differn't cars and headed down to Adventure Village at the Beach Strip. Eventually everyone showed up and then we went to the batting cages. Me, Dave, and Shawn went into the 'medium speed' cages that were FREAKING fast. I only got a hold of one and it went sideways, and Shawn sent one backwards. But then we went in the 'slow speed' cages and I totally ruled ass in those.   Then we split into two groups and went mini-putting. The first group was Me, Rachel, Dave, and Sarah and the second group was Shawn, Vince, Steph, and Megan. The first hole of the day and the first person to go, Rachel, got a hole-in-one which is impressive. Well I mean nobody else did it, so it had to be impressive. Hit of the round however had to go to Sarah Mayo who hit her ball and got it stuck in the trees ... classic. In the end yours truly ended up with the big 'DUBYA' with a score of 44, beating Shawn who scored a 45 and Vince who scored a 46 marginally. Then some of us went back to Daves.  At Daves we played some good old soccer for quite a while until Vince and others had to leave which left The Triad for a usual Friday night. Dave's neighbour Mark came over for a while and we ended up playin Texas Hold 'Em poker which is always fun. Then we decided to go golfing and Dave thought it would be easier if we just stayed the night at his house so we could go golfing early in the morning, so we went home and got our stuff and then went to McDonalds for ice cream and then back to Daves in time for David Letterman and his band to sing "KNOW YOUR LOCAL CBS WEATHERMAN!"    Saturday   Well The Triad and Mr. Scarrow got up and went golfing in what we called "The Milovanov Buddy Classic Open." Dave dominated the round and got his first tournament win of the year tieing The Triad up at one win each.   After golf I headed to my grandparents house to visit my cousins and aunt and uncle who are down from New Jersey and we played some Mario Kart Double Dash. Later on Vince asked me if I wanted to hang out with a bunch of people and I of course wanted to.  So Saturday night Steph walked to my house and then we walked down to Paramount Park and met up with Vince and Rachel and then Nichole came a few minutes later. We pretty much just walked around and played keep up with Vince's soccer ball all night but it was still fun.     Sunday   Sunday I got up and my grandpa called and wanted to take me and my siblings out for lunch and stuff. So we went mini-putting and then he took us to McDonalds and then he brought us home.   When I got home me and Dave made plans to go to the movies to go see Ferenheit 9/11. So we went to Silver City at like 5 to make sure we got tickets and then we went to Chapters to kill some time, looking at books and stuff. My favourite had to be "Jerry Seinfeld: SEINlanguage." Anyways we headed back to Silver City and ate and then we went into the theatre which was PACKED ... EVERY seat was taken. The movie itself was really good I thought ... The only thing that made my stomach turn was when they showed a public beheading. But all in all it was a great movie I thought.  So thats been my weekend. Busy busy busy but fun as hell. Lets hope the Summer stays this way and goes by SLOW.
