Now I love my Norco and riding her but I must say I have fun something new, not that I would trade her in for anything or stop riding her, but STREET LUGE people, its one of the newer X-tream sports, it's been going for 30 years and is still in its younger years but with the right luge and trucks plus a could frame, shoes and street wear you can  have the time of your life clocking up to 150km p/h on a hill, very cool people, very cool. Now a good board/ frame will cost up to or about 900 dollars and should only be made out of type 7 aeroplane aluminium ( not beer cans, thanks RALPH)
