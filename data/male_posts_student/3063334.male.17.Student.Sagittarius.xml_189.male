In the grunge era of the mid 1990's, bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana influenced me, as a elementary schooler, to pursue such the novel brand of JNCO.  Now if you are pronouncing it JUH-N-COH, start pronouncing it JEEN-COH.  During this time of my life, others strayed to other brands such as Lee Pipes-a jean that went straight down and was usually ridiculously baggy.  Another blogger, Rob Muilenburg recalls JNCO's by stating "they changed my elementary life in a time when I hated Phil Sobolowski"  Yes, Rob, I agree with you, they did also change my life.  The JNCO scriblle will always live on as long as there is the memory.
