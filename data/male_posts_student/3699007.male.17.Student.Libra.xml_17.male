Saturday I went to see my grandmother...she is doing decent I guess, but knowing she'll probably be gone this time next year isn't too comforting. Today, I did absolutely nothing. Amie said she was getting back saturday and I haven't heard from her, so I suppose I'll call her tomorrow because I miss the hell out of her with Britt and Ashley gone now and I have nothing to do. Dad wants me to go to work with him tomorrow, but I don't want to. I hope I don't end up getting dragged into going...uggh.
