Graduation was... alright.. it had its moments like me with an FU on my cap and me doing the RVD pointing thing on stage infront of thousands of people. Heh... I even gave the dean a high-five. That was fun. It was just a long ass ceremony. Afterwards my family and I went out to eat and after that I went to a little get together with Janet, Julia, Andy, and Janet's friends. The result of that... let's just say sushi, japanese beer, Jose Cuervo, Smirnoff Ice, and a shot of really cheap vodka is not good on your stomach.  Hmm...what to do today?  ***
