Granted, his rhetoric was stirring, but Journalism 101 told me a cited source is always better than an anonymous source, even if your anonymous source tells you that the sky is falling.  And by god, I'll believe Diana Kolman before I believe George Bush.    Many questions left to be answered, though I am waiting to hear the mass of business-clad, pump-wearing blonde twentysomething women who don't know what a good lay is tell me that the Bush administration once again provided the  urlLink Smoking Gun .   Confident Patriotism .  However, for once, the hegemonic-happy  American People (tm)  urlLink got it right .
