Not so much, to unpack and unravel, but to understand who dictates the course we travel. Every year, without fail, certain dates set in stone, crop up on the calendar pages, inviting us into action, prompting us to conjure up a certain feeling. The effort of the earmarked day is to manipulate the condition of your heart into a position where it beats in rhythm with the consensus. That 'special day' requires of you very little, just to feel a 'special way'. I've never really been too hot on the idea of imposed days of pre-determined feeling. I ask myself. Is love dynamic, or purely mechanical? A love comprised of a few token gestures at strategic points in the year. An intermittent love that appears back from exile, only to make a fleeting cameo. Hello and Goodbye love. Staying over just for the night, fleeing in the morning, to be seen again at a pre-arranged moment. A moment of mechanical love that seems to appease, never quite accomplishing a fuller release.  Dead Saints, the servants of the Holy God. Can they, pray as you may, be the ones to impart a glowing sensation of warmness, formerly known as gay. That dead saint deity, bringing you bags of gayety! Saint. Valentine, I presume, a lovely kind of chap. Never to meet him, I do sometimes sincerely doubt. On the 'day of love' I traipse home in the rain, wondering whether St Valentine is away from his office. Did he ever receive my fax? I did so plead for a share of love to fulfill my need. He surely is a lovely kind of chap, I will undoubtedly receive my portion, that 'love feeling' to halt my heart from reeling. That saintly dude, a devoted chap, never did hear my plea. The elusive glow for that 'special day' again keeps well away. For a manufactured day, custom made to exhibit our unending capacity to produce feeling, we opt to live in make believe, feeling because we ought to feel, disregarding the sadness our eyes can see.  In Simpsons, we have a scenario, where due to the dearth of meaningful days of celebration, there is an acute need to create something new. A new day, worthy of celebrating with all your might. 'Love Day' something warm and fuzzy, something pink and cuddly, something happy and joyful, full of heart and good-will to mankind. A love that is nice, so cute, happy to hug you for hours on end. Universal 'love day' would probably be a huge commercial success, competing to knock off ST.Valentine from his pedestal of love. The feast at the love festival would be brought to an abrupt halt. A juddering halt, when the realisation dawns on us, that we have begun loving love. To love love is to miss the point, to ignore the people, and ultimately fail to ever meet love. In loving love you never begin loving people, but a fading glow that is passing away. God is love. Therefore his words are in love. Obedience to his words keeps you in his love. When in God, then in love. When in love, then bearing fruit. Not just on the day of harvest, but continually into eternity. Who is satisfied with love days, often empty, always temporary.  I failed to ring my Dad on Father's Day. No shame in that, it was not a blip. I got me thinking though. A blessed boy I am, to have a Father in my life. So many without, and without memory. Memories aplenty, stories of old, insights into love and life, who I am and where I'm from. His eyes would crease up at the corners, in readiness to shed a tear, moved by something unknown, yet beginning to move you also. I'd keep checking his face to gain clues on his emotions, inside I would react in tandem, wanting to share his sensitive heart. Now here, away from home, the simple strumming of the guitar takes me back. It's a clear signal. Father is home. You are secure. Be still and know that your Father is in the house. If our new spirit cries out Abba Father, then let this heavenly call, be also to our earthly Father's. In the present climate, social policy and the welfare state make the Father redundant. Independent women, single parents and the paternal state are trying to replace the irreplaceable.  Happy Love Day
