Anyway I got up, brushed teeth, got dressed and went to Hardees for breakfast of course. Then I got to work around 8:45. Daycare came at 10 and didnt behave very well. I got off at 2 and of course as soon as I was about to get in it started raining. So I just got out and came home. I came home and got in the shower and now I'm watchin Pastor John Hagee then Pastor Rod Parsley. Dont know what I'll do after that, probably wait for full House to come on at 6. Anyway have a great afternoon. Love Carson
