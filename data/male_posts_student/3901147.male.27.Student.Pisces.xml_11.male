I may actually have to bust out my PS2 and start playing some games I have.  I guess I haven't completely given up video games; just online games.  I probably wouldn't have done that but the main game I play didn't work on my computer after I fixed it's major death spell.  So rather than pay for it I cancelled my subscription.  I woudl love to play it but that would require me reformatting my hard drive and backing all my saved stuff up to try and fix it.  You know what.. I'm too lazy and I guess I wasn't that obsessed with playing that game after all hahaha.  I'm waiting for a couple of beta test cd's to arrive for me to test some up and coming games for the public.. sometimes I sit and think about how much fun it will be and almost start drooling.  Then again sometimes I sit here and wonder why I would waste my time.  Ahh well.  The wiff and I are in desperate need of groceries, but we can't seem to drag ourselves to go.  Both of us get home and are too tired or get busy watching some dumb tv show to drag ourselves there.  We have got to get our motivation back soon!  Rob
