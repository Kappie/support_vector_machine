All in all, this was the best weekend that I have had in a good long while.  No crazy stories though... hehe...  Cant wait for this weekend when I get to go up to Kalamazoo and meet Sam's friends finally.  For how often I've been up there, I have only met Emily, this girl in her program.  So I cant wait to meet the rest and hang out for once.  That and I need to cook...  Just what, I don't really know.  Maybe Tortilla soup...  I'm good at that one, pending I use cilantro instead of Italian parsley.  Yes, I'm a dumbass, but when you have a constant cold, smelling stuff isn't too easy.  So yeah, anyways, around Christmas-ish John's present to me is the next set of iron body moves, and also pressure point info.  For healing of course.  Re-routing to center Chi and whatnot.  That reminds me.  I wonder how Lark is?  She had surgery Friday to have her sinuses reconstructed.  Fun stuff.  She might be there after class tonight depending on how well she feels.  All I remember from having my tonsils and adenoids out was no stressful movement for a good 3 weeks or so.  Insane.  Stress is probably the worst thing I'm feeling in my life right now, and I know its affecting others close to me (either by my stress or their own).  John was philosophizing on Saturday on how life doesn't get any easier.  I somehow wish he wasn't telling the truth.  I'm still pretty far behind in my schoolwork, although I got a freebie for one of my stats quizzes.  Makes life a little bit better.  Since I should keep working to make sure this stress doesnt get too out of control, then I should go back to my work.  Oh well.  Maybe more tonight depending on TKD.  P.S.  Ive decided that I really only respect bands that have more than just guitar, bass, and drums.  Sitting listening to Chicago, I came to this conclusion.  I mean, seriously.  Chicago, Jethro Tull, Ben Folds, Dave Matthews, etc.  It takes so much more talent to come up with a song when you have horns, string, and percussion than just a guitar.
