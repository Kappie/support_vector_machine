I had to train a new kid, so I had someone to bitch around, but nothing for him to do!. Anyways toward the end I had to start making some chicken, which kinda pissed me off because I was cleaning the floor already. So when that was done, we started cleaning and had it all done by 5 till. Well Loryen, the manager tonight, would not let me leave. She said to go help Lindsey or something until my shift was over, which is 9:00 (5 minutes!). So I grabbed my mop and finished moping her section, which took no time at all. After that it was about 9:00, and she still wounden't let me leave. It kinda pissed me off. Oh well. After that I headed home and showered up. I was planning on going to the drive in with Ashley. So right when I was leaving to go to her house, there was a lot of sirens going out. That got me excited. So I finely later found out that someone was having a graduation party and that fire got out of control. No big deal so I didn't miss that much. Tomorrow I got to work 1 till close (8:00). It's a lot of hours, especially when I can only work 5 hours straight since I am under 16. This week since school is out, I will almost make 40 hours!! Money Money! On top of that he gave me another raise. That's great. Oh yeah. I also got a job cleaning Edward Jones! That should be an extra $20 a week, which I will need for gas. Christ look at the price of gas. Was a $2.15??!! That's BAD. It needs to go down!!! I am so glad that I have a little car. It gets about 26 miles a gallon. I am happy!! Zum Zum!!  So I am getting a little tired. I wanted to study some out of my Ham radio book. Oh yeah, I am getting my amateur Radio License. I want to become a weather spotter. I am also stating to be trained to help out the American Red Cross. I will help out local people around here if something would happen to there house, such as a fire, flood, or a tornado. It is a lot of responsibility and time. You have to respond to the scene and make sure the family is OK. You have to make sure they have a place to stay and then after that you have to help them recover all they lost. Also during the disaster, you have to help take care of the emergency workers, such as the firemen. You have to give them drinks and feed them if they are hungry. Its going to be a lot of work, but I think I am going to enjoy it.   That's about it for now. I am getting tired. I want to go to bed! Goodnight to ALL!!! Eric
