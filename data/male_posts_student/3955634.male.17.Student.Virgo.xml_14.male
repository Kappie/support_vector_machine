Paris is furious, the Foreign Ministry rightfully labeling the comment 'unacceptable' and demanding an explanation.    The irony of it all is that Sharon's comments will only serve to heat up anti-semitism around the globe. What kind of world leader so deliberately and audaciously would tell foreign citizens what their best decisions and options are? One gets the impression Mr Sharon is suffering from the worst case of hubris in the world (even including the White House).    Right now themost harmful thing to Judaism across the earth is the policy and attitude of Israel under Ariel Sharon and the Likud Party.    (ADDENDUM: Worth seeing is  urlLink this photo from Reuters/Vincent Kessler . It's not just the Jews who are suffering from racial hatred in France. Though the problem is far from widespread on the whole, it's definitely important to note that Muslims (5 million strong in France) are also receiving swastikas as treats from racist vandals.)   (ADDENDUM #2: This is silly but can't go unmentioned.  urlLink Matt Drudge is insane . Completely off his rocker.)
