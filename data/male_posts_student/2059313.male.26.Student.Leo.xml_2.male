Anyway, I saw a commercial on TV just now that made me think about her coffee exploits.  The commercial opens up with what looks like a marathon, but just on the peoples feet.  Noone is wearing tennis shoes, or running shoes.  There are a lot of high heels, dress shoes, doc martins, etc, then it shows a bunch of people all dressed up and running to work.  People are stopping by a coffee shop like marathon runners grab cups and bottles of water along the side of the road.  At the very end of the commercial is the best part, one of the gentlemen that had grabbed a cup of coffee was running with it.  He had a very determined look on his face.  Suddenly he takes the cup and splashes the coffee on his FACE!  Like runners do with water to cool down.  Now the reason I felt it important to write about it... is it seems very much like that.  People often grab their morning pick-me-ups on their way to work, and it works in essence like a runner splashing water on thier face.  Kinda strange.  I guess the whold point is: I'd rather have water splashed on me than coffee?
