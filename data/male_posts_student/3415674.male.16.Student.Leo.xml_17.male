Face the fact that your angel of lead Wont give you the advantage here  Theres a point I’d like to prove But you just pull away From me...  Storm their homes, raid their lives The more you take the more you die Feel the rain crash down on your soul Now ask why as you lose control Reverse the tide, start to slide Reap the worst you Jeckyll  Hyde  You are the anti-christ You are the bullshit Don’t concern me with making profit I see, and I believe But you just nuture my disease
