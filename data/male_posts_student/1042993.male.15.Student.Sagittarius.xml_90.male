You must call yourself a geek and be proud of it 3. You must play the piano... by ear only....  Sorry for the strange requirements, but I don't have that many Gmail invites left (2 actually), and I just thought I would have fun with my last 2 so it might take a while to find people who meet the requirements. The last one will be especially interesting .  I do play piano actually... by ear, and for my church, and I've always wanted to talk to someone I don't know that plays by ear. Not only that, but as I mentioned above, I want to put specific requirements now that I only have 2 invites left.  So, to get it from me you have to send an email to astaro@alltel.net. In the email I need to see your name, your Leoville ID, and your email address - all in list form. I am just going to trust that you meet the last requirement -- I may ask you a series of questions to prove it, or I may not. So, why embarrass yourself? If you can play piano by ear, ask me for an invite. If you don't play, then just don't!
