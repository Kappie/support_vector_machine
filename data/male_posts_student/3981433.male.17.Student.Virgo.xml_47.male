Its gonna be a laugh, i'll probably take charli - shes a nice lass and we get on well...  so yeah tomorrow to the agents - hopefully - then maybe off to play some pool.  grr been so bored all day...  Watched a film called Hidalgo lastnight. its good - really good camera angles, good, believeable story in itself. I think it was based on a true story, about a Mustang vs Through-bred hourses in a cross country race across arabia.  i believe it was supposed to be released last month - never happened - such a good film though!
