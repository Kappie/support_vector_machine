Heinz has apparently gained incredible market share since it started making ketchup in colors besides red, and in e-z-squeeze bottles suitable for drawing pictures.  I think law school could learn from this strategy... adding fun to everyday items... imagine if our casebooks were printed with glow-in-the-dark ink.  More fun to read.  Can read even in bed, and we wouldn't have to worry about falling asleep with the lights on.  Or if professors had to wear outlandish costumes to class.  Might increase attendance.  "Federal Rules of Civil Procedure" comic books, animated "Restatement Cartoons" starring our animal friends Richard Posner Porcupine, Justice Cardozo Dodo, and Oliver Wendell Horse.  Or maybe not.  But think about it.  Wouldn't it make law school more interesting?
