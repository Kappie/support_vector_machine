I've only had to swim for short spurts and with plenty of treading and resting. I'll have to try this again.  Speaking of exercise, I'm feeling the burn. Or at least I was. Yesterday, my arms, back, and chest simmered in a dull yet persistent pain. My manboobs shot twinges of ache whenever I walked down the stairs. I honestly believe it was the best physical feeling I've encountered in my mortal existence.  I finally started reading  The Dark Elf Trilogy  by RA Salvatore. And reading...and reading. I stayed up until almost 1:00 AM even in the full knowledge that I'd be getting up at 6:00 to deliver the stenuous Sunday papers. It was that good to me. I really enjoy his descriptions of the battle scenes. And of a functioning matriarchy. I always knew letting the women rule would result in a chaotic society of calculating backstabbers, rank-obsessed warmongers, and demonic goddess worship. j/k. The feminists will eat me alive tomorrow. It also is interesting how I see all these megathemes within the book and worthy quotes to consider. I considered this no more than RPG fanatic guttertrash but I can think of trash far worse to read (The 7th Tower by Garth Nix comes to mind). Maybe it is because I'm looking for these themes and quotes now. It's a logical irony: when you're really looking for something instead of casually perusing, you tend to find things.  Didn't you get the memo? I starting to take a more analytical approach to my reading. I'm going through this book and underlining strong passages, circuling words I don't understand. The next book I read, probably  Walden  by Thoreau, I'll start writing my revalations in a notebook. I got 6 of them from Staples for 50 cents. Damn straight. $.50. I am elated beyond words. I'm also planning to take notes on sermons, friends, and discussions. To help me remember and to help me learn. It shall be the Year of the Notebook.  Speaking of sermons, Pastor Al asked a good question, "What am I doing here?" In church, he meant. I honestly couldn't answer "correctly". The right answer is to further my relationship with God through his mediator and my saviour Jesus Christ. The true answer is that I go to my church out of force of habit. I loathe the pastoring style of both head pastors. I timed Ron's Opening Prayer at 10 minutes 25 seconds. It was mind-numbing and spiritually tortuous. I should have liked Al's sermon: he spoke in the langauge of my people, the theologians. He discussed the importance of saying, "Thanks be to God" after the reading of the word. But a rebelious streak runs in me now, one that I must control for now. It is no good to strike against such an authority, even with only words. But the thought of testing another church and another pastor is savory to my lips.  Speaking of theology (this post just keeps branching, doesn't it?), I've finally found the core curriculum for Calvin College. I jumped for joy at this almost random success on the Calvin website. Now I know that many of my AP classes coincide well with the basic courses, and the courses I miss are either impossible to get at Mona Shores (religion classes) or worth taking in college (English classes). When asked what college I planned to go to, I countered with "Calvin." It felt so natural. Calvin is the logical choice: it's close so I can be near family and debate for possible assistant coaching, it's big, it has all the majors and study areas I want and awesome profs, it's relatively cheap (to other colleges of it's grandeur), and the atmosphere is just deafening in its Christianness. But I will call upon other colleges in that sweet paranoia of my life: that the heathens gods of college application will keep me from blessed Calvin, and I shall be forced unto some lesser dwelling.
