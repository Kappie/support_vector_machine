There are a lot of films out there just asking to be ridiculed. Instead of wasting time on those I thought I'd share some that I am looking forward to seeing or ones that I just thought looked funny:   urlLink Team America: World Police  -- It's funny that a film like this is coming out after the  urlLink Thunderbirds  gets remade and replaced with a live cast. How did anybody ever greenlight  urlLink Bill Paxton  in a movie after... you could really put just about anything of his here, and why is  urlLink Ben Kingsley  making films like this? This actually has nothing to do with Team America, but these questions need answers.   urlLink SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie  -- Being a fan of the show of course I'm going to look forward to seeing an hour and a half of spongy goodness. And the  urlLink teaser  is one of the most imaginative things I've seen in my 23 years.   urlLink Alien vs. Predator  -- I've been looking forward to this one for awhile, 'cause I'm a comic book nerd and a sci-fi dork. After a bunch of video games and comics telling stories about it we finally get to see some action on the big screen.   urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  -- I don't often like stupid comedies, can't beat  urlLink The Jerk , but this one looks pretty good. I don't have a clue why this one is so different to me, maybe it's because it was made by Mormons. They're a weird people.   urlLink The Incredibles  -- Pixar can do no wrong in my book. I have yet to dislike a film they've made and  urlLink Sam "Bad Mother Fucker" Jackson  is in this one.   urlLink Garden State  -- I've been waiting for this one for months. This  urlLink guy  told me about it and after seeing the trailer I was hooked like a heroin addict on  urlLink Coke . I also recently discovered  urlLink Zach Braff's blog  about what he's been doing recently to promote the film and his thanks for everyone's support.  I didn't know this blog stuff was so trendy.   urlLink Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events  -- Again, don't know why I like this one. I saw the trailer and just thought  urlLink Jim Carrey  was funny as hell and he plays a number of parts. After a couple of flops my faith in him returned when I saw  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and  urlLink Bruce Almighty . And after taking a quick look at  urlLink IMDB  for some stuff on him it looks like he's going to be playing Walter Mitty in a  urlLink film  just announced.   urlLink Finding Neverland  --  urlLink Johnny Depp , (with the exception of  urlLink Secret Window ) 'nuff said. Looks like he's got some  urlLink good   urlLink stuff  coming up too.   urlLink Collateral  -- I haven't seen to many movies where people get shot lately. That's really the only reason. I'm not a big fan of  urlLink Tom Cruise , I think he's  urlLink overrated .   urlLink Batman Begins  -- For the love of Joe, it's fucking Batman! And this one doesn't look like it'll  urlLink blow . The only beef I've got is the weird title.  There may be a few other trailers that I've seen that have sparked an interest in me, but nothing really worth mentioning. This is a pretty good list for now. If there's anything you find let me know and I'll check it out and possibly make fun of you for recommending such a stupid movie.  This is a record for me as "longest post yet." High five!
