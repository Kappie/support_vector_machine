Paella is good stuff. The Washington Monument seems smaller than in pictures. The Capitol seems bigger than in pictures. How can anyone go to the various memorials in D.C. and feel war is a good thing? Sandwiches galore! Sangria is great too. Sing-a-long with the Darkness can hurt your throat. Walking is exercise. I want to use the Library of Congress's reading room. Cherry blossoms are pretty. Harry Potter 1 is a good movie. Homemade pizookies are fun. NIH is quite a labryinth. Geese take large dumps. A bar, coffee shop, and bookstore in 1!? I touched a moon rock!  Good times with my Cambridge buddies. So Chicago next time around?  Ok time for lunch, and then I'll call Nick to see if he still wants to see Hellboy.  ****
