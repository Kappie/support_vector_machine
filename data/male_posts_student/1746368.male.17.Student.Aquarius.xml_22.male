One of their pastors are going to Ireland for a missionary trip, along with his wife and three kids. So, we really didn't have a sermon or anything. They had desserts (I didn't eat, wasn't hungry, not a big dessert fan). We sat at a table and talked a lot. I've always wanted to go to a church I've never been to before and pretend I was deaf. I always thought that that might be fun. I could ignore anyone I wanted to (I've always wanted to do that) and I could sign to people. Probably will never happen though.  Afterwards we went back to Dominique's house for a little while, and she and I played Scrabble. She beat me, needless to say. I really am not that good at that game, I never have been. Then I played Snood. It was funny because I beat her highest score on the first time.  Well, I know this is not that long, but I really don't have much more to say. Good night everyone...er...good morning...er...good afternoon...whenever you are reading this...so yea...bye bye...er...yea.
