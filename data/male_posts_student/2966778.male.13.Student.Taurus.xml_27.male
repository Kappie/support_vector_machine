I'm probably gonna buy there album, "Ocean Avenue", next.  It's a good album.       urlLink Steve Burns : The guy who used to be on the kiddie show, "Blue's Clues".  Yes, his name is really Steve, unlike that new guy who plays the pathetic little brother, Joe.  Hey, I used to watch the show before, OKAY!       urlLink Coheed and Cambria : Check out "A Favor House Atlantic" and "The Crowing".       urlLink Toothpick : Check out "Super Size Me".  It's the theme to the movie  urlLink Super Size Me , which I am interested in seeing.  Anyway, later.  (That's a pretty predictable ending by now, right?)
