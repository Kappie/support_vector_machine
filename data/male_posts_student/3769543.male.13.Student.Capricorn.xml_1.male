The title of it is "Fifty Million Broadway Gold Diggers on Forty Second Street". Long, isn't it?  Anyways!  Everyone that's going to the movies after VBS: Are we going to see Spiderman 2? It would be cool if we saw both. Make sure to bring  lots  of money for DDR. I want to prove to everyone that a fat-ish white-boy "wanna-be Asian" can kick normal Asian people's asses at their own game, kukuku. I wonder how many texts I've sent to Anna so far... She's the only one who talks to me on the phone. Everyone else has spoken to me twice, or even less. If you haven't spoken to me in real-life, you're hella lucky. I hate my voice. I can't have it go up very high. It can be annoying for theater.  Very  annoying. I can't wait until my Mashimaro faceplate for my phone comes. Hopefully, it will be here today! I'm not very happy today, not too sure why. Didn't fall asleep last night until 2. Fell asleep with my phone in my hand. Anna was texting me, but I fell asleep, so I feel bad about that. Woke up at around 2:40 and texted her back saying "Sorry, I'm sleepy" or something like that. It was kinda funny. Then again, most things are funny at 2:40 in the morning on a weekday. I really want one of those light-up batteries for my phone. The ones that have a clear case, and light up when you get a phone call? Have any of you seen them? They're so awesome.  Very  expensive, though. $40.00! I couldn't believe it! I would've bought one, but my mom was being mean and stuff and she said that "I don't need one, because [I'm] getting a better phone in October". I still want my phone to look good while I have it. I don't like the way it is. Very ugly. I can't wait until VBS, because it sounds fun. I just hope they don't try to convert me.
