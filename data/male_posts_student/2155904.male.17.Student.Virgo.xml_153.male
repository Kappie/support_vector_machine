So today's actual day was pretty fun.  1st period Tyke got back a group test he got an A on and they still got screwed by the teacher because of her homosexuality.  2nd period involved Tyke dominating at football.  He may not be big but he can still play.  3rd period was a treat.  An easy, for the most part, test followed by dancing.  Yep, dancing.  Tyke got down to the funky 50s beat and shook it hardcore.  It was a blast.  But then Tyke had to say goodbye to Purdy for a little while as she was not in the second half of his classes.  It turned out they saw other twice more but still...Sunday will be fun at least.  4th period was its usual jocose self.  Hamlet movie barely got any watching by Tyke's corner.  They played Connect 4 (in which Tyke beat Amed) and then some games of Hangman (Amed couldn't guess SHOE when he had S_OE for the longest time).  So that was fun.  Then Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed went to Pie for lunch when Tyke saw Purdy again and then they were joined by Kinker and Macaroon for a wonderful lunch.  Then came 5th period.  A stupid calligraphy test in there but it was ok.  Then came the Physics mid-term which most likely sucked for Tyke but he can't really tell.  Which kinda sucks but it's ok.  After school Tyke played bball at Amed's with Dr. Phil, Maniak, Kcaj, and Macaroon.  Oh, and DUI.  They played some guys who had graduated 3 years ago, maybe 2.  No, 3.  Pretty sure 3.  One of them was big.  Prolly about 6'5" and used to play basketball, football, baseball for the high school.  Pretty good.  Tyke guarded him a lot cuz he is ok at guarding big guys.  It was fun.  Tyke ended up getting a major cramp in his left calf which he still can feel to this very minute.  Later on Tyke went over to Kinker's with Tyronious and Macaroon for Shithead, poker, Mariners, tacos, MOH, and ESPN.  It was pretty fun.  Certainly nice being on break.  That makes everything not bad.  Which is fun.  For those of you who don't like how Tyke blogs now as much as how he used to blog he will begin to divulge some of his emotions more frequently.  At the moment Tyke is just sorta relieved to be out of school for a while.  He is content (not really content but close to it) with his situations right now.  Unfortunately there isn't anything more he can really say.  At least for now.  This is just the beginning though.  More to come...
