To the tune of "Friends in Low Places" by Garth Brooks  "Friends with Low Paychecks"  Blame it all on the heart They just ain't that smart To go on and work for a firm They  have higher dreams Naive as it seems There's stuff besides money to burn  Spent fall in a suit Got offered the loot But just couldn't make themselves sign Like no lawyer should They want to do good But now they drink water instead of the wine  Oh, I've got friends with low paychecks With a cardboard home And a pile of cases That need appeals No fancy meals One firm hour's their whole day-checks Just for fun they write themselves giant play-checks Oh, I've got friends with low paychecks
