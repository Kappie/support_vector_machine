People were going through hot actresses and such, which was weird for the crowd, and I said no, the hot ones are all in modeling, like my gf, hehehe. I wasn't joking either :-*  and damnit, I miss you. Good morning btw, if you are reading this at all close to "now." Its officially the 24th here, you know what that means :) One less day until I can see you. Oh yeah, and tell christen happy late birthday as well.  I now have two more things to say, kinda rant-ish.  First off, don;t freak out if things aren't back to normal the minute u get off that plane. Nothing has changed I know, but like, its going to be weird, for both of us. I dunno, I just wanted to make sure you dont get like pissed at me if i act like an idiot. To be honest, I am not used to having your presence grace me really, lol. Its been a while. I probably sound silly, or am worrying you, so just, dont worry. Awkward, thats how things will be, and I hope you know what I mean by that, and its in the good way, not the bad one. The "overly giddy and excited and happy yet still trying to get un stressed out" awkward. *shrugs*  Secondly, the word love cannot express how I feel about you. There is just something so great with you, something I have never felt before. This is going to sound weird as hell, but I have half said it before. I miss YOU. I don't miss fooling around with you, I don't miss having you here able to "show you off" as some people I know do. I miss just plain you. I feel like and idiot for dating diana, and for ever saying certain things to her. Because what I feel right now, even with you so damned far away, is so damned strong. There is not a thing I would change about you, and you are beyond my dreams. I never thought I could be with someone as wonderful as you. I honestly thought diana was the best I could do at the time, half the reason I stayed with her. And I want to say something else, and dont feel bad at ALL. After her, I wasn't planning on dating at all here at riverview. My dream was to run off and get as far away from here as possible. Find people that would understand and like the real me and not make me show off just to have friends let alone more. As much as I goof off, I am incredibly self conscious, very shy, and have the crappiest self esteem ever. I dont admit that a lot, but its part of this. I just wanted to say I changed all that, and I changed it for you. I could have easily said I wasn't interested, although I never thought I really had a chance. But you are too good, just too damned special and perfect. And I am glad. I don't know if I am coming off as arrogant or rude, because I in no way mean to. I am just trying to explain how much you mean to me, because just one, two, or more words cannot describe. I love you Michelle, I do I do I do. Someday I may repeat that after a different set of words too. Time can only tell, but the future looks bright. "What can you see, on the horizon?" To which I answer, the brightest thing of all, you. *mwah*
