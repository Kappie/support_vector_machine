Today I went to church and hung out and then went to pizza hut with Nate and his family. Good day so far, but it seems this weekend has gone by way to fast. I did have a lot of fun. Friday, haning out with Nate and Amber. Saturday, Maddy, Jordan, Tanya, and Rich came over. I'm preparing myself for the week ahead of me today.  Could be fun but probubly not, I like it when you're expecting a terrible week and then it ends up being a lot of fun and going by really fast.  Last night I had an awesoem conversation with someone, it was really cool. I like talking to my friends on the phone about whatever, but I love talking to my friends about things that really matter... like important things. I don't know, I just don't have many friends I do that with so yeah it's cool. I was thinking about what kind of music The Great Basement Crusade plays and it really sounds like .... wedding music. Well atleast the slow songs. We have a lot of those cause I wirte a lot of the songs on my acoustic guitar. I would like to see what would happen at an acoustic show somewhere. That'd be cool.  Well I'm done writing because really I have nothing else to say. Were working on a new song which sounds really sweet! So I'll put the lyrics up on the site soon.  urlLink The Great Basement Crusade   I'll see you guys later.
