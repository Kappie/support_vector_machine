       
       Eyes.  The glimpse into your soul, yet at the same time, the welcomed intruder.  They express emotion so beautifully- fear, anger, sadness, passion, happiness, angst.  They cannot lie.  I'll never forget that moment we locked eyes, you, suddenly shying away.  And then you looked back.  All of those emotions, suddenly melting into pure bliss as I stared into those piercing eyes, seemingly carved from stunning blue perfection.       Never look away.   Sweet dreams.
