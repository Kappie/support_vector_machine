I got a lot of great pictures of the stars for the people I like the most, plus we were able to see where Cindy is going to live in a couple months.  LA is huge.  It doesn't make sense to have a city that takes over an hour to get through and you're still only half way through it.  We got free Sierra Mist that was being handed out.  We got to see On Air with Ryan Seacrest.  We saw the Chinese theatre and went through Ripley's Believe it or Not.  Once we finished that, we finished the walk and went to McDonalds for dinner.   urlLink    Me in front of Gene Roddenberry's Star  We drove to Dodger's Stadium and watched the game.  A lot of great catches and slides and everything within our view.  It was great.  We got home around midnight here, 3am in NY.  Very tiring.   urlLink    LA Traffic Is Busy!   urlLink    Aaron, Nola and I at Dodger's Stadium  We're about to leave for Universal Studios, I'm looking forward to it.
