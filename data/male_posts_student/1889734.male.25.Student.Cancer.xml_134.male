Would you then advocate the strategic strike on Pongyang or Tehran or Damascus?  Would the deaths of millions of citizens of these cities, who had little to do with the actions of thier leaders, be justified?  Does 'an eye for an eye' salve your conscience?  Or is it better to prevent this scenario through action against those that wear the uniform of rogue states?  Perhaps they are just as innocent, but they have made a choice to serve such a regime.  Consider the logical outcome of inaction.
