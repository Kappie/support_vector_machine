Cuz i knew we had the capability to kick this teams ass...but we didnt...we fuckin played like shit..especially me...i cant believe i did some of the shit i tried to do...like take 2nd ball or not go for a ball...FUCK!!! I SO WASNT FOCUSED!!!...well we lost 3-1, we won the 1st game then we lost the next 3 and at the end of the match, casey started yellin at jon cuz he i suppose to b are go 2 guy, but he didnt hit well, pass well, or serve well...well i do agree wit casey cus jon is suppose to led us into the championship and hes not doin his job. Then he yelled at Brian for not gettin easy ballz up, like the one that landed right in front of him...and then he said that i couldnt block the big tall black guy, and yeah i didnt and i feel like an idiot cuz he alwayz hit to his right...God im fuckin stupid. Yeah, and that was it...so on the way home i basically felt like shit and then i hear rachel tellin leonard about relationshipz and shit...so that got me more pissed cuz she is a fuckin liar...she fuckin to infront of my fuckin face about "this girl" a few months back and shes over here tellin leonard about honesty???...u gotta b fuckin kiddin me. Then meeeesh lost his keys so we had to stay in the school for about an extra hour til his mom came and dropped off some spare onez...and yeah...that was my fuckin night...goodbye.
