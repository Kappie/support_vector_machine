There were a good number of times I laughed out loud.  But it just didn't hang together.  The second half dragged.  It was scattershot -- some jokes hit, some jokes missed, and there wasn't an overall solid coherence to it.  Or at least that's my opinion.  Five Things I Would Not Want To Be Stuck On  1. The fence of a house about to get hit by a tornado 2. A fat person running on a treadmill  3. A bed of nails 4. The roof of a retractable dome stadium as it's retracting 5. An about-to-explode grenade
