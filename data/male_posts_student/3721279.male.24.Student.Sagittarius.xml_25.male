And you wonder...you wonder about how similar life can be for people, even though they are so far apart. What makes two people think and feel the same? How can you never know someone, yet the moment you meet them, it's as if they've lived next door to you since you were three, played in the same sandbox, and scraped the same knees? Amazering.  There's a pleasant wind today, and I want to just be out in it all day. This is the kind of temperature that I absolutely love, when it's warm, but there's a subtle wind, cooling you as you move and breathe. Alas, I will be stuck in the mall of doom, making my buck by giving my customers their only reason to exist. Wait, did that sound mean? Crap.....(violently erasing karma from character sheet)  I always write too much for each gaming session we have. Still, I'm always afraid that if I  don't  write too much, somehow my players will figure out that I'm less prepared, and then will completely circumvent my plot and leave me with nothing but my improvisational Dungeon Mastering skills.....which, just so you know, don't exist in the slightest. There are just some spells that I never prepare for, like Wind Walk. Forget the air ship. Now everyone can turn into mist and travel 600 miles an hour. I'm so screwed. Still, for  once  I feel like I can challenge my players in combat, and may have actually figured out how to give their magically empowered asses a real fight, without having to resort to dropping dragons out of the sky. Oh, and did I mention how nice it feels to have a group full of players who consistently make an effort to   role-play  ?! Yeah. That rocks my world.  I feel sexy today. Yes yes, I know. Mark your calendars. This may be in part due to the fact that I pulled off 20 some jack knives today, and I only mean to do more. Somehow, I don't feel more gross after I work out like I used to, so I imagine this as incentive to keep working out more and more. I was going somewhere with this, but now I've completely lost track of my thought pattern.  I want to keep talking to you. I really do, honest. But now I have to go and be Salesman Dave, the craziest employee that Gamestop has ever employed. I promise to come back soon, so no crying. Okayloveyoububye. (skipping away)
