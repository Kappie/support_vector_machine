I looked the word up and i found a bunch of definitions... couldnt decide which one I liked most to fit the theme of the song and the movie (Spiderman 2) check it out yourself... http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Vindicated  Prtty cool morning... woke up to French Toast... nice... Went up and played crash and watched sunday morning sportscenter while reading the sunday paper.   Now watching the Marlins game... before there was lightning... I dont like lightning very much. I dont like any natural disasters very much probably since 2nd grade because that was my first tornado warning.. and I wasnt cool with that. Especially since like a week before i saw the movie "Twister" which is a GREAT movie... no... not really... Wow, I think im an incomplete person... becasue of the fact that a use too many caesuras... these things... .... ... .... (yes daniel, it is CAESURAS im positive)  Its 3:46... Andrews leaving today until Friday... mixed emotions about that. Whenever one of the brothers leaves ( I have two), the other two always get spoiled with things we dont normally get spoiled with becasue there are three of us. Ex. Going out to dinner more, we see something we like, we get it .... yea... spoiled but thats ok... We're not hurting anyone.  Characters Andrew - Second youngest brother ( chuckie9225.blogspot.com )  Chris - Youngest brother.    Something Corporate Ruthless This is the only lonely picture Waiting on my floor littering my shore This is the last true burning letter Given to a girl Written by a boy Living in a world Created to destroy  But if I built you a city Would you let me? Would you tear it down?  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what i should have know then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not done Waving goodbye well at least you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me  This is your ghose that kneels before me Razors on her tongue a body full of oxygen It won't be the last time she'll ignore me Thinning in my skin Without the strength to go Winter setting in To cover you in snow But if I build you a city Would you let me in? Would you tear it down?  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what I should have know then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not gone Waving goodbye well atleast you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me  I'll raise towers and climb them Rivers and walk them Oceans to drown in You won't make a sound in  But there you go for the last time I finally know now what I should have known then But I could still be ruthless if you let me But there you go when I'm not done Waving goodbye well at least you're having fun The rising tide will not let you forget me ...forget me    I love this song... I m trying to try this thing where i post a song every post...
