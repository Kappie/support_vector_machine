So now there's news of this course that I can take, and at the same time, possible for me to differ NS. Unfortunately, it's the only course. It's Bachelor of Arts (Professional Communication)...two years. Basically, it's Mass Communications in S'pore. Well, I wanted to take Mass Comm. But it's too hard to get in in S'pore. But here's a great opportunity, except that I would have to study overseas at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Cool huh...but it's really a tought decision for me again. So my friends out there, do pray for me. Thank U!!! Most importantly, pray for God's direction. Today's band practice was fun. It was like we were just playing the music for fun. It's rare that I actually enjoy band practices. So it was happy day! hehe!
