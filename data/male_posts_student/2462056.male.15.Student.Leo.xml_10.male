I'm going over to someone's house and we are going to hang out with people and watch them and stuff! Its going to be fun.  Yesterday I went to a pick-up soccer game, and we played until around 7, then everyone left.  Then I went home and ate some FRENCH TOAST! That stuff is so good.  Then Claire and I went over to Andy's house!  We played DDR, fooooooozball, watched some Tv, and just hung out.  It was fun stuff!  Yep, then we left around 11:00 and then I came home, and i did some stuff for driver's ed, then I went to bed!!! Whew, I've gotten like, a total of about 18 hours of sleep since Sunday... that's like, almost as long as you're supposed to sleep each night on summer vacation.... crazy stuff.  Yep! The two people that I'm riding with for driver's ed have never driven a car before... that should be interesting.... haha.  Wellllllll, yep! Thats all I have for now.
