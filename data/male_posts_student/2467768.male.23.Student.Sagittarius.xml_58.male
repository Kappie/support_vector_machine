This community site is completely done at a Beta Version last night, around 0245hrs, Sdyney time. The uploading to the free ftp servers was really a painful time bomb. Lots of errors were prompted out during the process of uploading to the server. Anyway, it's a free server. No comments can be made from that issue.  Cool, now every part of the intergrated designs is working, although there are some bugs can be identified from the site. We are still looking into the matter. No hurry ...  Hopefully, by the end of this week, this site will progress with more contents and lives here. We really appreciate all your support.  Cheers, People At Haxmanz Technologies.
