      Glenn, nice list.  I feel somewhat justified now for having Eternal Sunshine on my list since you put Kill Bill on yours.  Though I did not see it five times at the theatre.  I don't have that kind of money to throw down.  I don't feel the way you do about Lake City.  Of course I haven't really lived anywhere else.  I'll be very glad to get out of here, and I mean very glad.   Looking forward to your venting.
