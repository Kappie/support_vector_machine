I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?  It comes down to this You wanted this you wanted that I gave, I gave, I gave, I gave I never asked for a single thing Now is my time, I want You to know, how bad I am doing, without you All I wanted, was you Now you abandoned me I'm alone once again  I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?  I want to be numb again But this pain will not go away You've screwed me over To many times before I refuse to fall this time You can not win anymore Because I have grown immune To your words, to your pain I've grown immune..... TO YOU  I've got scars you can't see A past of misery Then along came you You changed everything about me Now you're out of my life again How can I still be like you wanted me to be?
