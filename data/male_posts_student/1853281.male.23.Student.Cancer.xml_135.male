We went to Creative Fibers, and i bought a lot of wool to spin, and started dealing for a new spinning wheel, as i seem to have very bad luck with both the wheels i had, and which ended up either warping or the wood splitting or something. Afterwards we went to Diggers and spent an hour and a half or maybe two there. I got a messenger bag, a leather bag(very nice one), a man purse, two belts, threee ties, a sweater and a shirt. two hats and some other stuff i do not remember, and all of that for $4.25. God i love that place. Nothing really going on right now other then that. Day before yhesterday just hung out at the Triple Rock for a while, it was so relaxing to get out of the suburbs. I will be so glad to get home and back to the city, well, only a few days more of housesitting.
