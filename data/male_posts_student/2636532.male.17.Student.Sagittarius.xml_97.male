Seriously, you try writing a damn essay on the significance of memories of the past and support it with examples from literature that you read in class. i seriously don't get the point of diplomas, 50% of your mark on one freaking test. 50%!!!! basically whether or not you fail the course is decided by one test, worst of all it's all luck of the draw if you're prepared for it or not. no one knows what the essay question will be about and no one knows if the stories and whatnot that were read in class will have any relevance to the question. so it's things like these where even the english teachers were choked about it. stupid stupid question, and stupid stupid essay. -Matt
