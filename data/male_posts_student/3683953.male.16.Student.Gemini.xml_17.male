His plane leaves at 8:00AM. I'm gonna be so lonely without him. He comes back in a month, so I guess I'm just gonna have to find something to do while he's gone. He said I could email him and he'd try to write back as much as possible. I still have to send his letter that I wrote him. I'm just so scared to send it.
