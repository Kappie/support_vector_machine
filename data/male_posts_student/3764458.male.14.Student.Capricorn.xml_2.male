Yes, I call waking up at 8:00 early. Plus church is usually boring sunday mornings, and i get nothing from the message. Maybe because I am half asleep the whole time...i dunno.. Anyway, i'm home alone (except for my dad, who's sleeping upstairs) and I just noticed a new patch of Poisen Ivy on my hand. Ever since my slave-driving mother forced me to work at least two hours a day (I know, ladee freakin daa, but working at my house is horrible) i've been breaking out with the worst poisen ivy ever. My legs looked like raw meat for awhile, because scratching feels SO good. After a few days i decided to stop scratching it though, because it was even grossing me out, and i had to start wearing pants when ever i went out in public. But i still had scabby, bloody legs. Then i realized that i was scratching them in my sleep, so now i have scars all over my legs that will probably be permanent. I really wanted to go to the Guster show tonight, but i didn't....and that sucks.i can't wait for Warped Tour and Incubus in July, though. I'm gonna skip a 10-day "family" vacation for those two concerts. My family picks the most boring place in the world to go on Vacation, and that place is Asheville, NC. It's nice until about the third day. By the time the 10 days is up, we've done everything at least 4 times. The only things we do is go to Brank's (that is my step father's name) family get together, which blows, and go hiking, which is fun, and go to this thing called the Shindig. Why can't we go to Orlando like any other normal family? Because we're not a normal family. I would go into why we aren't but im sure i've bored you enough. So i'll change the subject. I watched "Vanilla Sky" today. It's one of the best movies i've ever seen. It's very clever, and i love clever movies. It's also got a lot of Radiohead in it...and i love radiohead. Radiohead reminds me of MUSE. And MUSE reminds me of this guy that me and Alex got into an argument about MUSE. He kept saying they sucked, and we kept saying that they didn't. That went on for about...oh..45 minutes or so. Then Andy came over and we went to Rickers and he stayed over till like 5 am. It was kinda boring because Andy wasn't as funny as he usually is. Anyway, i know this is getting long, but im going to keep typing until i go to bed. If you love me you'll keep reading ;) Nonothin for the winky-face. Those of you out there wanting to know what i meant by "nonothin," I shall tell you. When you do, or say something stupid, you say "nonothin" and if you don't then someone can call "hands" on youfor saying that, then you put your hands out, plams facing down, and let the other person slap the backs of them. My brother and his friends started doing it and it rubbed off on me. We've gotten to the point now where if someone calls hands on you that they dont slap you're hands, but you still feel just as guilty for saying the stupid thing and not calling "Nonothin." I was in the middle of a new flash animation when i started this, which is my new hobby. I submit all of my stuff to newgrounds.com, but it all gets voted off. People just don't appreciate my type of humor. I know this comes from nowhere, but i really strongly dislike that Last Straw, of First Straw or whatever it's called song from 311's greatest hits. It was unreleased, and i know why. It sucks. I'm starting to like The Love Song. I used to hate it...strongly. Im gonna take a break on writing now and watch all of the old Homestarrunner toons. Ok, I'm back. Welp, I think im going to bed. G'nite everybody.
