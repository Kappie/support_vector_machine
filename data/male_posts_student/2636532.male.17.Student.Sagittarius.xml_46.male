Not only mad, but now she totally distrusts me and the thing was she thought I was at least one of her favorites just this morning. She invited the top 10 people in our grade to go on a conference with her for the day. It was all these workshops in French about future careers in French. Well for the final part of the day my friend wasn't feeling good so we skipped the ending ceremony and went outside. And then just met at the meeting spot at the time everyone was supposed to meet up. But before we got there she noticed we were missing and someone told her that we skipped the whole thing to go shopping. But it wasn't true! When we showed up she wouldn't talk to us because she was so mad. The only thing she told us is that we aren't allowed to go on the 2 other conferences this year and told us never to ask to go on any other one. We didn't get a chance to tell her what happened and now she was so mad at us. She is mad because we didn't tell her were we went and she thinks we skipped out because we weren't having fun and went shopping instead. She took it as a personal attack on her special day. She feels that we were very irresponsible and now she doesn't trust us because we went against her. But all we did was go outside for 30 min and walk around the block a billion times just to get fresh air. I've known this teacher since grade 5 so she is soooo disappointed in me. So now she doesn't trust us and even if we explain it then things wont be the same as before. Since this is the maddest and most hurt I have ever seen her. And so my relationship is screwed up with her... and I know we should have asked her before we left because that wasn't good not too, but its worse what she thinks now about us and I feel sick because she doesn't trust me anymore. - Dark Lily  0>--}----
