You do something to me that I can't explain.    So would I be out of line if I said,"I miss you"?"        -Incubus: I miss you     I'm tired. School has been tough and I'm trying, really trying hard to grasp the concepts for C programming. Earlier today, we had something on "Logic gates" *sigh* I got so frustrated because I could follow, butI was still unsure and I just found out mistakes all over. I'll keep my head up. Kuan KO is starting to get on my nerves, why does he not utilise a full 2 hours to teach us math, he does 1/2 hrs for a 1hr lecture, 1 hr for a 2 hr lecture. He marked us late for lecture too, even though it was only 3 mins after he started his lesson or rather made his entrance into the lecture room. Other classes are starting to piss me off, when Kuan KO asked why we were late the other classes were busy shouting "go work la! work at nite la!". That was because Reiko said that the first time she was late that she worked at nite. To hell with all those fools from other classes, if you want to play the dissing game you better buck up before you even test my patience. I'm not feeling very friendly tonight.    I realised i spent a lot of time with Amy and Xing today, and it was good, ya'll mahhh 2 best buddies in school. Thanks (: Btw, me, Jon, Xing and Imm registered for the R 'n' B night on Fri, i'm looking forward to it. Just let me loosen up a lil ya? Me, Amy and Xing chilled at causeway point this afternoon, and took some pictures, good ones (: I'm feeling a little short on words tonight, getting lost in my train of thought.    After that I met my baby at her school, I was so glad to see her. I wish I knew the words to tell you how badly i've missed you, and how to tell you how torn I'd feel when I see you walking away when all I wanna do is to grab at your hand, pull you close and share an embrace. That's when I miss you most, you're so near, yet you're that little distance away. Its so nice to know you've missed me too, but I know the both of us haven't had it easy, missing one another. Nothing's stronger than the faith I have in the both of us, I can make things happen, so can we, will you keep believing in me too?    Amy said this, "those who have a lot to write in their blogs, sometimes are the most troubled people." I realised i've written a lot over the couple of days and I have my own problems, but I know I'm still contented with the lot i'm given. Writing, has always been my very own method of expressing the deepest emotions that I hide from almost everyone. I feel really weak now.    PS to Sky: Bro, lonely portrait is inspired by a song. Sometimes, the most beautiful words turn out to be those of sorrow; the sweetest songs tell of sad memories, beautiful pictures portray heart-breaking departures and the best novels convey a   br o k en   love. I am inspired. Was I once lonely, yes, very. If only anyone out there, knew how it felt to have yourself erased from pictures that kept memories of the past alive, what if one day, no one remembered your existence. So vulnerable.     [take away our names, would you still remember me?]     "And I don't want the world to see me    Cuz I don't think that they'd understand    When everything's made to be broken    I just want you to know who I am"        -Goo Goo Dolls: Iris     The very picture of  you  lying on my shoulder, sleeping so well, happily yet because you were tired, hurts me.  I miss you.       Then comes a day, Ishall awake with you by my side. Our hearts make a pair, don't they?
