Like some rich ass hot mother fucking bitch with some beemer for a car who starts crying because she has to make her own dinner, or people who have friends and loads of them and they still arent satisfied with life, school, etc.  Fuck them, and Fuck You.  Like all the clicks at Ballard have pretty much formed for the time being. And I am glad to say I don't belong to any of them.  I don;t really have as many friends as all the other fucktards out there and I don't really give a rat's ass. So good for you all you fucking preppy rich fucks, the wanna-be rebels who are really rich preps on the inside, and the people who want to be preps and can't quite get there. All of whom use the word random out of context and way too often.
