I've been playing Americas Army quite a lot now. I mean the game you fool, visit  urlLink http://www.americasarmy.com  for more information. Anyway, it seems at about 6pm everyday I can't seem to login to my account, which means I can't play online :( For god sake, I was enjoying the game. Stupid Americans! Fix it lol, I want to play.   Doom 3 is nearly here as well. 16 days to go until it comes out. I am gonna get mine from  urlLink http://www.mx2.co.uk  because they have the special edition there for about Â£24 which is a deal and half lol. *sigh* Another great thing about PC games, they are much cheaper!   What else am I doing...ah yes, slowly putting things on Dark Rose:  urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk  I made a web template for it. But I must tell you that it was Chrono's idea (he's a friend, look in my friend's list). You can have a look at the template  urlLink here . Now you can see why I said it was Chrono's idea :P   I'll try and post more when I get the time, my sister is still into PC gaming :( It's nice, that another member of the family has the same interest as me, but I'm gonna get annoyed if I can't use my PC when I want, and we only have one :(   That's all for now. Buh bye!
