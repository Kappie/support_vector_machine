Not that there's anything wrong with the old stop sign, or that it takes four men to unhinge it from the post, or that they have to keep their truck idling while they do it. The orange vests are good for safety reasons but quite honestly no one uses that street any more. Its two businesses left years ago and there are no houses. So . . . yeah.
