I see small changes in my life - butthey are nowhere near the extent that i want them to be. . . . why do God's answers sometimes move slowly? How does one know when He's not forcing a door to stay open, when God in fact wants to shut it? How does one increase his/her faith = like i feel like God really wants me here at this time but certain criteria are lacking for said thing, or how much should i reach into the world before i am the world? i apologize for the ramblings - i usually like to speak coherently - peace people > Travis
