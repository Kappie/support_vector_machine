Mom took Riley to the playground (that's her new thing) and I stayed home. It was a nice day so I was outside for a while. When I wasn't, I kept eating candy, which I had a huge craving for ALL day. I was constantly back and forth to the cabinet grabing hand fulls of Swedish Fish and Sour Patch Kids. Then I ate some blueberrys. At least that was healthy. I had gymnastics tonight at 7:00 and yeah it was the usual. Hopefully, tomorrow will be more interesting because I'm tired of writing about nothing. We're going to Seaside hopefully next week which will be fun and I've got to finish my summer books. I read a bit of the Good Earth today. One word for the book. Blah
