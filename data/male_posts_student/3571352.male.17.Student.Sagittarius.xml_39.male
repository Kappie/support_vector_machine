Your browser offers this cookie, which contains a unique ID number, every time you enter any page on Google's site. If you don't have a cookie, Google will give you one with a new unique ID number.  All of your search terms are saved by Google, along with a time stamp, your IP address, and your unique cookie ID. So far this information is not considered "personally identifiable" by Google because your IP addresses might be dynamic. (Broadband addresses are often fixed for weeks or months, but dialup addresses are very dynamic.) The unique ID in the cookie is the one thing that identifies all of your various IP addresses as coming from the same browser.   So first step is to clean out your cookies and then block google's cookie.  Use the images below.
