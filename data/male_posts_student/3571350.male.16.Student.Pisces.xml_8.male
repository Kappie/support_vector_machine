I ate lets say a little more than some crutons(the things you put in salads that are crunchy but really good alone) and my mom didnt complain. What a relief there for me. I started reading someone else's blog who is an assistant manager at a strip club. Its funny/weird at the same time. And NO IM NOT FREAKIN MASTURBATING. Im not a sick pig(sorry for any1 who's offended for some reason). Its still hot here but i guess it calmed down a bit. By the way im a member of a tennis message board in which i have 11,500 posts they are mostly caused by my boredom and i have nothing else to do. I play two fantasy games that are the MOLE and SURVIVOR. Im doing good in both of them but i really like the survivor one better because it involves alot of strategy and paranoia in which i find interesting. Im in the final 7 in survivor and ive survived 3 eliminations in the mole game. My brother is gone to work until who knows when so im on his windows xp computer,25 inch screen which is the sweetest computer you may ever see. My brother is an okay person. I sometimes really hate him and sometimes i say he's okay. But I think he's been secretely smoking pot in his room. I just don't know what to say most of the times and I cant believe my parents dont know the smell. I KNOW THE SMELL AND I HAVE NEVER SMOKED POT which just says how much more i know than them. My parents have caught him alot but i think they've just given up which is really really really stupid of them. Also Im going to therapy to a councillor who doesnt swear alot like my past one did. The first time i heard of threapy was only weird and stupid and crazy people go to it but I guess I was extremely wrong. It's just to gather and share your thoughts with a stranger if that sounds right or correct in any way? Well theres nothing on tv tonight except the first season of the mole on the network for games. So dont be surprised if i show up again writing here :D
