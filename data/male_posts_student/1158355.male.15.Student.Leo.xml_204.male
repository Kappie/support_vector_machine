You witness all the families being separated, children and wives being killed, and you flip out. When on the way to your working post, you knock out one of the Nazi guards, take his clothes and gun and infiltrate deep within the core of Auschwitz. Your objectives are to free as many Jews as possible and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. When I mean slaughter I mean you get to pin them on walls and slowly kill them. You can also regain your health by getting it on with the women Nazis and then killing them. As for food, you're not gonna take the Jews extremely small ration of bread so you have to either take the Nazis food or eat the Nazis, I did say violent. I think many would enjoy this game because it's all about revenge which is one of the most powerful emotions a human can hold. Ah yes, and you can bake Nazis alive in ovens, and they're completely awake and alive, not knocked out like the Jews were when they were burnt alive. You can watch the Nazis scream and melt. Here comes the best part. Once you save all the Jews and kill all the Nazis in Auschwitz, you drive a tank into a nearby German bunker where Hitler is...the government doesn't want people to think Hitler killed himself but you did it. The big boss. Adolf Hitler. You gun and melee fight him, he grabs you and attempts to crush you under an incoming tank but you flip him over and hold him there stabbing his stomache so he doesn't have the strength to get up. Here comes the American tank...and off with the lower half of the body. He is still alive. Remember this is Hitler, you want to torture him before you kill him. You drag his half body (him yelling and crying for help) into a random pool of this acid shit that rips his skin away. Then a random belt sander, sand his remains of flesh, then cut his nose and ears off, and staple his mouth shut, and keep his eyes so he can watch the magnificent site as you blast him off in a cannon into the sky...him disappearing and landing who knows where. This game would have to run on an upcoming gaming system for its intense and extreme graphics and would be rated MATURE. They should make more games like this, such as Stalin, Bin Laden, Hussein...but unfortunetly the arabs would go crazy ass on us and bomb us again. So stick to the Hitler one...and the Stalin one.
