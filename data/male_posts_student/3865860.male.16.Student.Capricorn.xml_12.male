Been a total snorefest today and i didnt even get to eat sunday roast, we had lasagne kinda weird for a sunday night but still tasty :) Just been hangin around really, hanging around and thinking (not good). I thought today what if the world was made of plasticine, we wouldn't have to worry about asteroid strikes and the kids of the world would have something to do. I suppose it would be hard to grow crops and stuff in it so we would probably starve, still it would be fun. Also i decided im gunna talk properly from now on. I'm gunna be all like what-o and im gunna say grass the right way. Its gunna so rule, i give u permission to hurt me if im not talking like that when im with you (dont hit me too hard tho). ANyway im getting a new comp sometime this week so i might miss a posting if my network is down. Don't worry i will make it up to you anyway you want :p Going to Drayton Manor tomorrow should be fun i get to go on new rides (YAYAYAYAY!!). I will explain tomorrow, if i dont throw up. Thats your lot for today, take it or leave it.  Tom  P.s. I was thinking about pink plasticine so the world would look pretty.  P.p.s. I wonder what it would taste like.  P.p.p.s E-mail me if you know
