Klaus Badelt is the creator of the music for Pirates of the Carribean! The music has an amazing sense of mood and power, and I really love them. It also fits in perfectly among my Howard Shore, Last Exile (Dolce Triade\Shuntaro Okino\Hitomi Kurioshi), and the rest =P   My site  My site required a LOT of work it seemed, mainly along the lines of W3C Validation (that's the set of rules and compliance for HTML on webpages). Now that is all done, all I need to do is add little thumbnails to the galleries =) It also has a new domain, now it is located at  urlLink www.smerity.tk  until I can get www.smerity.com =)   Spiderman 2  Quite an excellent movie personally, all the effects looked excellent, Doc Oc's tentacles were composited in the scenes perfectly. It also had a nice balance of action/comedy/drama (even if in some scenes drama is over or underdone). I personally think it was much better than the first, and I love coming out of a movie and feeling I could run up a wall =P   3D  Considering going to AFTRS (The Australian Film Television and Radio School) for my post HSC studies, as it is available in Sydney, has a strong creative/traditional art foundings and education on that subject and will speed track me through learning Maya. It has also been influenced by the recent success of Sejong Park, a student who went there, and now has an animation about his experiences in war-torn Korea at Siggraph.   Invader Zim  Trying intently to download Invader Zim, a cartoon about a misfit alien trying to "TAKE OVER THE WORLD!" While it may sound typical and common story plot, the way they play it out is amazingly unique, and is one of my favourite shows. Everything has an overexaggerated personality, and that's half of the reason I love it so much =P (BTW, may I note here BitTorrent sucks! It's supposedly supposed to increase download speeds, well, I have a modem, and so far I've downloaded 47.2 Mb and UPLOADED 244.3 Mb! Where's the justice in that! I have almost another 1000 hours before the download is finished... Oh well...)   Art/Creativity  I think I'm getting better. There are sometimes, when listening to music, or lying in bed before I fall asleep, that my brain just wonders and sees a million different things, a corridor here, a winding staircase there, anything and everything, organic or inorganic, and all things inbetween. Architecture unfolds with every beat of the music, a dragon unfurls from it's shell. It's quite amazing, drugs except with no injection, at least not one I'm aware of =)  Of note, I created three new 3D works recently =P        The Techy Trashcan =)  More info available at my site in the gallery pages, but the general info is the original image was created for a speed modelling contest, and from there it evolved into a scene. I still have a long way to go on the scene, and I just noticed how lowly detailed the trashcan is (I've seen it with 'new eyes') May have an update in the future    The Blue Mushroom! =P This I really really like. It started off merely modelling a quick mushroom (nice and simple things lol) and then I started to work on the texture and material heavily, and then I added a quick branch, and then some leaves. I'd love to make a scene involving this in the future. Enchanted forest, with some sort of twist, maybe pollution killing them off, a "you don't know what you're missing" kind of thing =)    Anyway, I'm just going to let my imagination run wild until I'm forced to go to bed, just relax and listen to the waves and babble on typing. I saw this really weird scene with some sort of mannequin smoking, sitting lazily on a chair with it's feet on a desk. A scene with a car speeding along, the speedometer going wild, when all of the sudden something happens, and you go to a view under the car, and see ice start to travel along a pipe under there, freezing up the rest of the engine. Just a note, a really weird thing on Nickelodeon at the moment, they feature a pufferfish singing an old 1970s (or 60s, lower) into an old microphone while he's underwater in his fish bowl ("I'm waiting for the moon, a little sunlight, and just you...").  Nova 96.9 commercial ("Sounds Different") features an old guy peeling an orange, which screams every time he peels it. Imagination back, an old man, with an old pair of half moon spectacles, a top hat, and a gold chain to hold the spectacles. He is facing forward (forward forward, the same way as the photographer) but turning his head to look back, and has a mistrusting look in his eyes. I'm starting to lose it, so I'm just generally typing, typing helps to bring it back, and just looking forward with my eyes closed, somethings come quickly, others not at all. A control room featuring gears, and old mono style levels (pull the long level back to control something). Some sort of reddish crocidile, with  bags under it's eyes. A robot, facing forward, with something like antlers, and his hands on the ground forward infront of him. Some kind of superhero, holding onto a cloud with one hand and grabbing someone else with the other, while he gets dragged around by the cloud. An Egyptian wall, with block collums to the left of a doorway, with stairs up to a giant door, and an Egyptian style dog at the top of the entrance, sticking out and protecting it. The top of a building, and the gargoyles on the side are replaced with ravenous dogs, their mane's hair stuck back in vicious spikes, and their mouths open to let the rain water drain out through them. It's all about trying to remain on this stream of images, adding tiny variables to keep cycling through the imagination in your head. The main variation I'm using is light levels (with my eyes closed), I turn on my picture screensaver, and it flicks to a difference size and contrasting image, changing light levels. I'm cycling music through my head too, and if I see a flicker of an idea, a balloon, a ballast, I try to focus on it and keep adding detail, or just staying with that in my head and seeing what I come up with. Just be free..... A generator in the middle of the air, with a spiral of small stars and particle streams all flying down towards it, powering it somehow. A building with two giant barrels on the top of it (cooling stacks, missile launchpads, who knows?). A giant robotic foot, nothing else connected, and all of the sudden part of it detaches and slowly goes down to the ground (like the back of a horse float) to reveal an army. A giant pole with chains coming off of it, getting struck by lightning, and down the bottom it is connected to an old book, standing on it's own stand, connect by a pole shaped like an upside down L. A snake charmer, with one of those goofy giant hats on his head, and a moustache, curled at the ends. A ship throwing anchor, with the anchor streaming past in the water, and the cannon on the boat in full roar with an aura of red surrounding it, blurred by all the motion. A guy with dreadlocks (brown) and a metal face, with screws holding it in place here and there, with an expression of a rockstar on his face. A young boy, African-American (ie, black, but I hate having to say it cuz I sound racist, and I'm not) with a green baseball cap on his head, looking at a wristwatch.  Anyway, the time is now 11:19 PM, I kind of just left this window open throughout the day so I wouldn't forget to post, but all that creative stuff I came up with in the last, probably half hour. Got stuck in some trance, still half in it now =) Goodnight! =)
