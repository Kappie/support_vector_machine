So I was one who helped move stuff so that they could clean up the water. It was a mess.       I bought some shorts today. They were on sale, and I needed some, so I got 'em. I have to pay Karen back because she bought them for me because I had spent all my money getting stuff for Bonny. While we were out, Mrs. Donna bought us lunch, partly because I am letting her use my room so she wanted to do something for me. So that was cool. We ate at Sonic. She said that they don't have Sonics in Iowa. That's weird.       After church this evening I took Bonny home and spent some time with her, but Seth had to bring David. ugh. They can be so annoying. Here it's like, three days before Bonny has to leave, and they are being a freakin' pain in the butt. I am very perturbed at them both right now. At least I got to spend some time with Bon.       hmm. I think that's pretty much it. I can't think of anything else, but if I do, I'll be sure to add it.       **end of message**
