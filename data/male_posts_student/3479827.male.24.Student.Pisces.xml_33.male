Today was expected to reach a scorching 36 degrees, so for most of the day we stayed in the relatively cool apartment.  At 4pm, when it was starting to cool down, we left for the shops. We wanted to get a new mobile for yuqi, her current panasonic was a bit too big. On her sisters advice, we took a taxi to a special high street. Unlike most high streets in the uk, where you can find 5 or 6 mobile retailers at best, this street had nothing but mobile phones!  China has so many different mobile phones and manufacturers, you are certainly spoilt for choice. As well as the big uk names like motorola and nokia, there's amoi, bird and haier to name a few. Small flip phones seem to be big here, and motorola is very very popular, much more so than the uk.  Yuqi had already fallen in love with the panasonic g51, being small, pink and cute. So really we were just looking through the various shops to find the best price. As it happened, after browsing for a while, yuqi's sister phoned. She has a friend in the mobile phone business who could beat everyone elses prices. So, we met her sister and headed to the 18th floor of a rather large building to meet the friend. In the end, we got the phone for 1000 yuan (67 pounds -bargain!). It's very nice, has a colour screen and some really funny ringtones.  So, yuqi now ecstatic at her new toy, we left for home. We all had dinner together, then went for a walk to the river in the evening air. I have to say it's still hotter than an average british day, even though it's nearly 10pm at night!  Interesting china fact #12 - a lot of chinese words are formed from the idea behind an object. For example, the chinese for computer (dian nao) means electric brain, train (huo che) means fire vehicle and mobile phone (shou ji) means hand machine.
