Usually I go downstairs to check whos online, but it was Saturday, so I decided to sleep in until I had to shower for work. At 9:30, I finally got up and dragged myself to the shower. 9:55 got outta the bathroom... hmm... late again I see... o well. Listened to some "Twork It Out" - Usher as I dressed. 10:10ish... punched in. After I put on my clip-on-tie and apron, I got the chance to catch up wit a guy I hadn't seen in 2 weeks. I told him whats been going on the last little bit, he said I was "pimpin it", I laughed and sternly told him "no". He told me that he's got a tough decision coming. He has the job interview which pays VERY well... but hes unsure if he wants to do this or go to UTSC for me... he said hes gonna pray at church when we go together tmr, but ima start today :)  O ya, we're doing this thing where we go to different churches and see the differences... I shoulda started writing notes... o well, we've only gone to 2 so far:Forward and his old catholic church, but I hope we visit lots more!! For those of who dont know... catholic churches IMHO are so boring!! Like no offense but it was too much. I stayed awake the whole time cuz it was an evening service so it was shorter and cuz it was my first time. They are very ritualistic there, lotsa chants and stuff they expect u to memorize. Also, I never noticed how enthusiastic Pastor McNeil is, but the main priest I guess is sooo boring to watch. I'm sure he was praying or something... but I coulda sworn he was sleeping for pretty much the whole thing!! He didn't preach but my friend tells me that they are very boring when they do, while Pastor McNeil is very emotional and talks to YOU... I love my church. I wish I was there more often... lol, I say this but I'm breaking some1's heart (well not really) by not going to the picnic tmr. Then again some1 couldnt tell me how to get there, and I did sprain my ankle so I dont feel so bad... but still... sorry :(. I truly will miss you, esp if I dont see u again...  Well back to my boring work day...after catching up wit my friendwhile filling the bread, we all topped off the grocery order, went on break (hehehe, extra long one), and buggies. Then he and I got split up, he did the dairy order and I did the pop >.  As soon as I arrived, I signed on and relieved me self of all that discomfort by visiting the bathroom... ah ya... felt so good after. Then I ran some sc wit my "SC GOD" of a friend, got struggled too many times (cuz of me :\), talked to Matt, relieved myself one more time and ran some ball.  When we got there, my SC friend and I shot around, then my bro came, and 2 others came. We ran 3v3 wit some other guy... WOW my teammate struggles!!! No offense but it bothers me when they struggle that much... I mean, every guy he D'ed up beat him in 1 second. And when a teammate starts straining, the team does too. I had to come over and help everytime and they would somehow score from open shots or beating me cuz I would have to run out to contest the shot. And hes offense is just as bad!!! He misses open layups, throws away the ball, and has the most dash shot EVER!!! **sigh** I'm sorry for saying all this, but I had to get it out. Well finally he left and so did the mystery guy, so it was just me, my friend, my bro, and his friend. We started a boring game of american, gave up on that and ran 2v2. Teams: me and my bro's friend vs my bro and our friend. Wow... my teammate is too good!! He's just all day!! He kept on hitting pull ups over my bro... that's the kinda shot that I work towards ^.^ Anyways, we won the first game 11-6. Second game: we started off on fire!! It was 7-3 when the I got injured again. I had been kinda struggling down low all day, but my shoot was doing good. Finally, I set up in the post again. As I backed down towards the left (if ur on offense) of the net, he pushed back. I did my fav drop stepto the other side and had a nice open shot. Here's what ran through my mind as it happened: "drop step, ok, elevate, follow through. Sweet, there's another poi-" **sickening snap** **yells of excruicating pain**  LOL, its funny now that I look back on it, but it wasnt at the time. My friend thought the yell was because I made a power move... I wish that was it. After rolling on the ground for what seemed like 5 mins... I told them "I'm finished" limped my way tomyball, and wit a few breaks outta the court. I climbed half way up the hill and plopped my large body on the bench. There I cringed in pain some more, and watched the a play from my sub. O ya, my sub was a lil kid that we sent away just a few mins b4. He acts like hes good buy... umm... no. I observed as my teammate drove and dished the ball to him. Then I watched as the ball slipped through his hands and flew to the other side of the court. Im not sure what happened in between, but I saw him get easily beaten by my man. It was gonna be a long day for my teammate... he was getting crappy partners all day. I was the only good one, o well...  When I got home I got a drink, checked my comp, and hopped up the stairs. Then I took a painful shower and cleaned my room... I dunno why either, kinda random if ya ask me, but I did anyways. Then I limped to my comp and started this. That was almost 2 hrs ago... well it's not really my fault... I've been chatting the whole time... wit 3 ppl at one point... but I've finally finished my boring day... and my ankle isnt feeling that bad... cant run or anything like that... but its not killing be as it usual does. But the morning after is the WORSE!!! Like one time I lilterally crawled to the bathroom to shower for school. I dont remember if I actually did take a quality shower that day, the pain was simply unbearable... anyways I should be good for wednesday scheduled noon game ^.^  Well last post I recommended some good RB songs... but a lil Mrs. KnowItAll said that she alrdy heard of all of them... so here are some good BSB  N*Sync songs: (**means not popular but still great)  N*Sync: **Everything I Own I Drive Myself Crazy  BSB: Quit Playin Games **Just to Be Close to You All I Have to Give As Long As You Love Me **Back to Your Heart  Those are my FAVS... there are alota singles that I didnt list, and songs that I enjoy but I also didnt list as to not clog up my blog. I just wanted my top songs for you to love and enjoy... so enjoy ^.^  Hmm... on a happier note: I made it one week without... doing something... at work!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!! thx for the prayers.  To every1 who wanted to see me at the picnic tmr: sorry, Im a horrible and lazy person... also standing all day wit a sprained ankle doesnt sound to appetizing. AND, I'd have to leave early anyways cuz I gotta hook up wit my friend and get some more vitamin G-O-D... anyways, if I dont seeYOUagain then I'm very sorry and I'll miss you the whole time... t.t  Matt: town centre sounds good, but I still feel bad for making you travel soooo far. I feel bad for making u watch Spidey2 again too... wow... I'm a jerk. But since we already decided its too late ^.^ ... hahaha... im so bad...  Anyone wanna reach pickering flea market?? I really need clothes... I need some 4x Tees, some extra baggy jeans, some new HIGH CUT ball shoes... hmm... thats about it.  O ya, I need y'all's (lol, thats so no a word) opinion... How would I look if I shaved my head?? Not like skin head shave... but more of a bald fade... like alota azns have. I really wanna try it but im afraid to part with these long, dark locks I love... and I'm afraid that it'll look bad... and that my head will be WHITE!!! Ah who cares??!! Thats something for my summer list for sure!  Anyways, See y'all later  Warren  [19]
