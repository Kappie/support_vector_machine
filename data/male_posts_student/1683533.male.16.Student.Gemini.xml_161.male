Oh yea, and yesterday I got my second pay check, my first was only 31 dollars, but this one was 67 0_0, I finally have money, and now I can't wait to spend it >_  Now I am preparing for the 9miles2go concert which will be insane, I cant wait.  I have been waiting to see My Friend Ehab and 9miles2go, there will be alot of moshing and skanking and fun.  I will tell you about it when I get back.
