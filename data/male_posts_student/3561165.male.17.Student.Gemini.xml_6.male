Yesterday I went to London for my bi-monthly singing lesson, which went quite well, I've basically been warned not to attempt to sing anything above top C in my chest voice to avert causing serious damage to my chords. Which is at a discordance with my wishes, but all the same, I don't want to rid myself of the small amount of talent that I've got. Anyway, I paid a muchly joyous visit to Camden, which is in my eyes the coolest place on Earth. There were volunteers from various Communist groups collecting signatures to get Blair to resign, a treasure-trove of narcotic-selling shops, an amazing slection of authentic foods, music ranging from reggae, to punk, to techno to metal, to prog to hell and back. And severe paucity of townies, which is just lovely. The place has an inexplicable energy to it, the market is like a maze of humans, smells, stalls and other such things, something that you'd read about in a futuristic cyber-punk novel. The only cause of a disquietitude in me was the fact that this bustling centre of commerce is apparently a nexus of left-wing views (as shown by profusion of Communists), which is a bit ironic, maybe even slightly hypocritical. Also the looming presence of new developements of the capitalistic mall ilk contributes to a sense of unease in me, which wasn't there on my previous visit. Looks like although the old dog has life yet, all the truly cutting edge people are moving on. I've heard good things about New Cross, but it isn't even on the tube, so I'm not even gonna go there until it is proclaimed to be "The new Camden" in triplicate. I guess I feel a bit like Dick Whittington whenever I visit London, it has such a vibrancy that overawes anyone from a sad little town like Stoke. I might go to 'Marxism 2004', which seems exciting, costs Â£22 for the week and comes with free accomodation (what do you expect, from we Commies?) and includes such left-wing speakers as George Galloway, Tariq Aziz (how very hypocritical, seeing as the left unequivocally slated Saddam's torture and despotism up until Gulf War I), Tony Benn and China Mievile, who is a great novelist. The themes and discourses should be interesting, stimulating and thought-provoking.  Anyway, it looks likely that I shall be in Camden next week, as Richard and I may be going there to celebrate the absolution of our exams. I'll definitely take Oli with me there when we go to see Slipknot on his eighteenth.  Mood: Contemplative Music: Pink Floyd - Animals (LP)
