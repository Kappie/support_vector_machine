That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."  Yet people still go after the mockingbird, rather than shooting down the bluejay. Why is that? Is it perhaps because they know the mockingbird won't be as quick to fight back? I think so. Just wait, though. If you push that poor innocent little bird hard enough, he'll do something about it, and it'll more'n likely be something that you're not ready for.
