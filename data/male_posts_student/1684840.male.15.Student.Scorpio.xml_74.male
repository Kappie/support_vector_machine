I went to Pets at Home to get some more fish for my tropical set up.  Trust my luck to get a male and female sword-tail fish!  It will be interesting to see what happens :|  Tuesday was cool too.  There were only a grand total of FIVE people in our French class, 10 people in English and 11 in Science.  It was pretty good, except for Geography where more than half the class were in!  I couldn't believe my own mind when I thought of a super twist in my story. I'm not telling a soul any part of my story from now on because I want to make it secret >:D  Today was super.  Lesson one was a right laugh.  Chris decided to experiment with Mrs. Lawley's Winnie the Pooh teddies and put them in vulgar sexual positions while she was whisked off to the reprographics room.  Oliver just wanted to hide them and make it look like they were having a secret tea party, which would have been hilarious if we had little cups!  Lesson two was boring and we just did normal work :(  GEOGRAPHY again!!  Science was fun though, we did some copper coating.  People were turning coins bronze and everything, well, when I say people I mean the few people who were actually in school!  English after wasn't really fun but time flew by.  A quick ten minutes in registration and we were free to leave at 2:30 due to Open Evening, didn't seem different though, but it was cool I suppose as we missed the lesson with Cruella De Vil!  Home was good apart from the fact Daniel was trying to make everything awkward!  Apart from that, everything was great!  Every Wednesday is really good!  Only 16 days until my birthday!!  I can't wait :D  That's on Friday though, another really cool day because the excitement of the weekend is added to it!  I better get off now before I fall asleep on my keyboard and dislodge the space bar like I did already last week :S
