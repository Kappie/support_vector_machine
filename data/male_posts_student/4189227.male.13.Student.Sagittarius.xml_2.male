Anyway we parked at a bar because they knew the people that own it. so we all got sodas and walked there but then it got a little cold so djs mom ran out to the car and got me and djs brother sweaters. on the way out we all got stamps that said good to go pretty cool huh? we went on all the rides execpt for freak out, super-loops, and a red one that goes upside down i don't know what its called otherwise think thats all the rides we didn't go on.  thats all i did today...i'm going to noahs ark on the 24th so i'm having a good way to end the summer. all of my friends are a good summer so far. i'm really bored right now its 12:13 right now its way to late for me but i always stay up this late i hate waking up early. i'm listing to blink 182 "the fallen interlude" my favorite song! i'm done now
