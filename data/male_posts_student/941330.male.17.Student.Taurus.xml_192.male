(why can't i use normal english? beats me.)   why don't i call people?  this interesting deviation of mine was brought to light recently when emma asked me to call her during her snowboarding trip. of course i said i'd try but...when it got to it, all the days passed and i never really found a convincing reason to pick up the phone and just press fogoggy. those seven numbers -- hell, any seven numbers -- get very hard for me to push. basically, out of every person i've ever called, only once can i recall having done it just for the hell of it. otherwise i've always had some purpose, whether it be an RSVP or asking where to go for a party. but calling just to say hey? what the hell is that...that's what aim is for.  so then i wondered, how many people think like me? i've got to be in some sizeable minority of anti-social, practical people who save social mores for actually meeting face to face, right? but from the conversations i've had, from the xangas/blogs i've read, i'm pretty damn wrong. and by considering what i believed to be arguments against it, i've figured out some fairly convincing reasons to support the practice of occasional phone calls. to keep in touch, silly billy.  if it's so simple, one might ask, why don't i do it?   yet for me, it's not really simple. i don't understand why, but all of my life i have been considering the feelings and circumstances of the other party almost as deeply as those of my own. so before entering those seven digits, i wonder...what if so-and-so is busy? what if so-and-so has someone else they want to call, but my calling will force them to politely postpone their desired conversation until later? what if so-and-so's running out of minutes? what if so-and-so has nothing to talk about with me? crap like that. it's just how 16.5 years of being a low priority in other's lives will condition you to think.   so, after this half an hour of written diatribe, i've concluded that my avoidance of telephonic discourse is not due to any sort of economic disadvantage, personality quirk, or lack of willing receivers -- it's a full-on psychological disorder. whee.
