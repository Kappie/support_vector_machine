I got to help her with some more filing and stuff so I think I earned my gold star.    I came home, got on the computer, got bitched at by Mike for something I didn't do, and that all led up to right now.  Florida school starts tomorrow!  Then there's Mandy. She came to my house last night and decided to bitch at me for something I didn't do. Bitch. Goddamn woman need to control themselves.  Hmm, the Spanish salesmen people Becca, Bobby, and me pranked keep calling my house.  Phew, that was a long entry.   The round has ended!
