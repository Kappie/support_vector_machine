It has tons of fun games, well at least fun for about 5-10-20 minutes.  Or what do you say about a game in Bomberjack, a jumpy adventure in TSK 2 or why not a classic like Space invaders? Try them all at www.123spill.no! By the way, I just caught myself posting cemmercials here, and I just wanted to say that I have nothing to do with this site except that I play the games on it =).        Wanna play a game?
