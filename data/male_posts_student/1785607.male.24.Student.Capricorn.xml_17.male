I of course being the drama queen that I am spilled all I had inside. He made such valid points of view, all of them true... Man, how good is talking with someone that brings a cold head.  Maybe the thing that he said and that stuck with me was: "...then what you are not used to is to feel for someone this way, or is that it has passed a long time for you to have someone to care for... that is confusing you. What you need to do is to take it easy."  What an eye opener... I should get more in touch with those who understand me...!
