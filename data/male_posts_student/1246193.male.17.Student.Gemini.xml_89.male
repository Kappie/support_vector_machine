That means that I am tired...dog tired. Although there were a few glitches, the trip was a success for the most part. I had a very enjoyable time, got really sick of certain people...though not the ones that I had expected to get sick of, and got plain ole sick. The flights were long and there were some problems, but nobody died...which isn't necessarily a good thing. By the end of the trip I had memorized the pre-flight speech--"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight ### nonstop service to (insert destination). Our estimated flying time is (insert number) hours. We ask you to look forward and pay attention to the flight attendants for flight instructions. Once again we hope you have an enjoyable flight and thank you for flying Delta". This was followed by an ignorant movie accompanied by hand-gesturing flight attendants. I think I actually laughed aloud every time that they show us how to put on the life preservers. In the unlikely event that the plane crashes into the middle of the ocean I sincerly doubt that we are all going to be as calm, and intact, as the people in the movie putting on their life jackets. If the plane loses power there is emergency lighting to show us to the exits...then what? Are we going to jump out of the freaking plane while it is 40,000 feet above the Atlantic? Hell no! The emergency lighting should direct us to the galley so that we can get piss-ass drunk before the plane depressurizes and literally disinegrates our lungs! And my favorite is the oxygen masks. If the plane experiences a loss in cabin pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling. You should put yours on before helping the people around you. The movie actually shows a mother calmly putting on her oxygen mask while her son sits idly by apperently not able to breathe. Then she helps him! What the hell is this? If the cabin experiences a loss in cabin pressure it means there is a hole in the plane. The oxygen is gone because a vaccuum is created within the airplane. Guess what that means people...the oxygen isn't the only thing that is being sucked out of the plane, bye-bye apendages! Good lord, that safety crap is a joke...just sit back and enjoy the flight. Skip to the very end of the trip and...  I, or should I say we, are sick because of pure stupidity. On the last day of our trip we wandered down the mountains in Switzerland to a nice little river. It is stream fed from the mountains and is the cleanest, and coldest, water I have ever seen. Everybody drinks it with no ill-effects. Anyway, some of us thought it would be fun to take off our shoes and wade through the water. That's right...we were barefoot in, literally, ice-cold water. It numbed your feet in about thirty seconds. However, I did have fun so I suppose it was worth it!  "The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land" --Gilbert K. Chesterton
