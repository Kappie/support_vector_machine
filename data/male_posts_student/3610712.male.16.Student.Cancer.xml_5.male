Sixteen is the age when you're supposed to become older, not just in the quantatitive sense, but in the qualitative sense as well. Maturity sets in when you're sixteen. You become mellow and the foundation of your adulthood is laid. I have felt like that for a long time, but still, it should feel a little different. Oh well, maybe seventeen.  Last night I went to the movies with Sarah to see "Dodgeball," it was excellent, but the movie was mediocre at best. Then last night I fell asleep while watching "The Empire Strikes Back." I awoke this afternoon at 1 o'clock and then left at 1:45 to go driving with Drivemaster Bill. I drove around for about an hour and a half. Then I got home, played Playstation for a good while, then my mom and I went out to get my cake when she got home. After the celebration of adding a six after the one in place of the five, I went back to Playstation and then got on the computer. That was my sixteenth Birthday, capitan.
