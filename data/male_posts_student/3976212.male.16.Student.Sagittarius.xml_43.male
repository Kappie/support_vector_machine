I keep screwing up...from now on I will really watch what I eat. Just plain Suasage, Bacon, Ham, Turkey, Chicken, Beef, Fish and Cheese for me. I might have some lettuce, and maybe a slice of processed cheese once or twice. I will also have to start limiting my consumption of Diet Coke and Chyrstal Light-I drink more than enough liquid, but not enough water! I put the google ad at the bottem of the page, but as usual it's not bring in money yet because this site isn't on listed on google yet which really sucks. But for now it's showing Public Service advertisments, so I just put it at the bottem of the page. When/If I get listed on google I will place it back at the top of the page. I really need people to link to me because I really need hits, and hits mean more advertising revenue. Well, hopefully one day this little blog will get the respect it deserves!
