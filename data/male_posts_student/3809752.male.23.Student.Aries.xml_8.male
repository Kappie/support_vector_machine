We covered ByVal and ByRef and we had a graphic representation of memory blocks on the comp that the variable saved its value to.  Ya like my grammar??  Looking forward to my 2nd project over the weekend.  Gotta watch a webcast on VB.NET and write a basic essay about it.  Sounds easy enough but then again I hate writing essays.  I would like to give mad props to www.ebaumsworld.com  great site for the person with nothing to do!  Anyway, till next time my faithful fans.... Take it easy.
