I got up at my regular time this morning to get a shower and be ready for my ride, but when I got to the bathroom it is already being occupied by both of my parents. I asked them why they weren't already ready and leaving. They had no answer, this pissed me off because they both get up at 5:30 and it was now 7:00 they have had plenty of time to get ready and be out of my way. So I didn't have time to get ready and missed my ride. I hope they write me a good excuse so I can make up the TEST I missed today!
