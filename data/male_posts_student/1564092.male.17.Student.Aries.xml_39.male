If you can't pick up a copy of today's paper, click on the link below where you can read the same article that was in the paper for a limited time. I  think  I could have written a better article but at least we finally received some sort of county recognition. Read the article by clicking  urlLink here . The Atlanta Journal Constitution is supposedly coming out to take pictures of the band for an article about our accomplishments at the football game tonight. The game should be interesting because it is not only senior night but eighth grade night and our last football game which also means the last time we are going to march the show. Pretty depressing to me but I'm trying not to think to much right now. I should post an actual post sometime soon. Maybe. Heh.
