I'm so use to crap getting thrown in my face at every turn I was expecting the same thing on this but in reality that was not the case. I'm still praying about this and having this week off from school and having no homework or anything else to do except review German I stuff my mind tends to wonder and look what happens when it does. Did that make any sense? We shall see what tomorrow brings... I'll try and post something that will hold your attention for more then three seconds and makes since to more then me and the two other people it involves.
