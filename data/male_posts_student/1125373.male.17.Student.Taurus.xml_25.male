Colin is no longer my hero  more to come...  hrm im in a writing mood  four long years of high school i wait, foolishly hoping for someone to date, the populars dont notice me, the smart people dont want me, im in a group of my own you could say.  one of my best friends lives in colleyville many miles and minutes from lewisville, though not here he treats me like a queen, he sees the things in me that arent easliy seen, hes a great guy you could say.  my idea of a perfect date is not the normal thought, the stars are the things i want- not what can be bought, a night on the couch with the movie is fine, the way i like to spend my time, just my crazy thoughts you could say.  my best girl doesnt go to my school, although together we're pretty cool, she likes dance, i like band, a weird couple of best friends you could say.  im pretty weird as you can see, im not the type of teen one can be, though i can be nice and funny, and like it best when its not sunny, thats what i am and i dont care what you could say.  :)
