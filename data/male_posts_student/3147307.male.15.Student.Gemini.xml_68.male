I lost in my bid for Sophomore class secratary. :(  One of Patrick's friends was helping to count the ballots in 3rd period (remember, we only have 4 periods a day) and I was in the lead. But my opponent, last year's class president passed me somehow. It so ticks me off. Its a popularity contest thats all. To prove that, the vice-president had made a campaign speech that wasn't approved and so they showed a picture of her on announcements and she still beat out her opponent because she is popular. I still might ask how close the race was!
