I don't have much homework, so as you see, I'm posting on my blog, I wish I had more to report but things are quiet at the moment.. too quiet...  Oh, I suprised myself by managing to play a solo, the one at the beginning of "Minibosses - Wizards and Warriors" but I also managed to get RSI or something, Repeatative Strain Injury, It gave me a sharp pain when I put pressure on my little finger, so no over-practicing for a while..  Oh yeh, my school banned the whole of year 10 (me) from the cantine at my school, for what a few people did (broke some new lockers) it was one of those "u'll all punished till someone owns up" deals, but cos the cantine started to lose money etc.. they had to let us back in today, but on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I beat the system, by getting my 6th form mates to get me food. Thanks guys.   I think it was an eleborate scheme to get us to buy food elsewhere, seems a convincidence that fair trade week in our school was also that week =P If I owned a shop over the road I'd always just come into the school, give the lockers a good kicking - so everyone gets banned - and everyone would have to get food from me.
