So, now I'm grumpy and I freaking hate all this "not-being-able-to-go-swimming/rock climbing/self-in-sand-burying-whenever-the-freak-I-want-to".  I'll probably snap out of it after a bit more playing around with the computer; I love my computer.  So,  expect more crazy websites and biting political dialogue, not to mention my blog as well.
