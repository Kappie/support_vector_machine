Thanks to Mr. McNally (Legacy X, if you will) for figuring out everything that got our site back to it's original form. It looks snazzy.  Well that's about it for now. I thought I might have had more to say, but I don't. Just happy to have WR back, with a working comments system and everything. Something goes right for once, huzzah!  "If 54 is more than 45 then what is the answer, Martha?" "Nine" "No, it's eeeeeight" "... No, it's niiiiine" "... Yes, I was just testing you, iiiit's niiiine. And that's a magic numbeeer."
