I watched the season finale of Enterprise last night before bed.  Pretty good, pretty weird.  I have a bunch of errands to run today, including returning a library book and mailing my license address change form.  I can't remember my license plate number and I forgot to look on the way in.  Arg.  I'm headed to the gym in a couple minutes with Anesa and Susan.  I think I'm going to go right home after work to start packing.  I have a load of stuff to pack.  The previous tenant of my current apartment is finally dropping off the keys today, so I'll be able to drop stuff off tomorrow.  There isn't anything interesting in the news today.  This week is dragging on.
