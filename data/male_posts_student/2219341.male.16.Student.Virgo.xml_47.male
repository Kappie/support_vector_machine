God why do i have to be this way?  why?  i think im having a panic attack.  im scared.  i havent had one since i had to go to a dentist appointment and Kari was there.  hold on.  i need to go lie down.  ok.  my chest is still hurting.  but it hurts most of the time nowadays.  its just really bad right now.  i dont know where to start.  im trying to sort out my feelings so i can write them down.  but its really hard.  my gosh i miss them so much.  i cant stop crying.  i love them.  and its so hard to accept the fact that they dont.  its just like they threw it all away like it meant nothing to them.  that everytime they said they loved me...it all meant nothing to them.  it was nothing.  but i was silly enough to love.  and my love was not worthless.  it was not fake.  i meant something.  and its not fair.  why do i still have to love?  i know that they didnt mean to hurt me...they would never want to hurt me...but they did.  im so stupid.  i become so attached to people who can be there for me always.  and i always get hurt.  i should have known that Mal would eventually, unintentionally hurt me.  i did know.  i didnt want to believe that would ever happen.  yanno what the hardest aftereffects of attempted suicide is.  once you've tried...it is so easy to try again.  because there is no longer the fear.  because you know that you CAN do it.  the only thing that stops you is yourself.  i hate this world.  i hate it here.  i hate everything about it.  i hate it.  im not afraid to die.  i am sixteen years old.  i long for death.  ill never make the mistake of trying to take my life again...but i still cant wait for relief.  for rest.  oh gosh.  its happening again.  i cant breathe.  im tired.  i do feel somewhat better.  L has been tryin to talk some sense into me...she does a pretty good job....  gosh my chest is killin me.  freakin anxiety disorders suck!  im so confused right now.  i dont know what to feel.  wow.  confusion.  i need time to rest.  and pray.  goodnight.
