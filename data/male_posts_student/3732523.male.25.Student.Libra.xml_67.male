Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  A one euro cent coin sitting on Monster's desk. It's sooo tiny I can barely read the date but it looks like 2002. Hrm, 2002, I was living in Manchester and experienced my first earthquake - and then about 30+ more as we experienced an earthquake swarm. Although the quakes were only tiny compared to the ones in Japan and California etc, they were still enough to wake me up or scare the hell out of me as everything shook about.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  The phrase "Back to reality" which is the title of a classic Red Dwarf episode in series 5 - ok I'm a geek at heart ;)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I can't think of one major honest thing that stands out really.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Laze around, watch tv, read a book, phone home, tidy up and spod ;) Depends on my mood really - and how good my latest book is!   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  I'd love to say there was some hideous ornament I would take pleasure in smashing, but I don't have one. Nor do I want to display my violent hatred towards any one person or object - so I guess I'll be topical in a sporting sense and say "I'd like to smash a winning volley at Wimbledon".   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  Hard to tell really until the situation occurs. Probably like most people, for my family and for my country.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Pedant. I guess because that sums me up :) I toyed with the idea of "dead" but then that might just be stating the obvious ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Bothers me? I can't think of any that really bug me atm.   What was your first job?  I delivered the local free paper. First off I helpd my friend with her round, then managed to get a round of my own that my sister helped me with. In the end I had two rounds a week (Tues and Thurs) - it was ok in the summer, but the dark evenings, the cold, wind and rain and having to lug round god knows how many papers - which a selection of glossy adverts - was a nightmare. Still it earnt me some money :)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...been to Norway. Been to the rest of Scandinavia but Norway has eluded me thus far.
