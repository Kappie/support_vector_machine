Today's Yom Kippur. I'm not fasting, but I don't think I've eaten any pork or shellfish products today -- yeah, I think the crab in the California Roll I had for lunch was just that imitation crab stuff -- so at least it's a step in the right direction.  They taped the classes today so people who missed them for the holiday can listen to them later.  Imagine trying to make sense of an audiotape of class, with the Socratic method and everything... doesn't sound like much fun....
