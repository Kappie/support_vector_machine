(You know, the kind like BabyD2034030473âˆž) That always gets on my nerves. If you do funny, do witty, like sockeatingdryer or mr.humphries. LOL I got out of school really early today due to that I only had one exam today. I have washed my hands of 4 classes as of today. Next up: Algebra II and 10th Literature. Speaking of which, I am phreaking out over my Algebra exam. I don't remember how to do all of the stuff on it, and I am so scared. I have to make a 70 or above on my exam to get credit this semester (I'm smart in everything but math and the occasional science) and I don't remember how to do it. Golly-gee, I am in a pickle. I was invited to attend the Worth County 4-H Awards Banquet this Thursday evening. I think I'll do it. I already know what I'm gonna wear. Speaking of 4-H, today's 4-H Day @ Wild Adventures, and most of the cool counties are going. But guess whose county's school system isn't out yet.   ME!!!   You know, this whole pushing-break-back, pulling-first-day thing is really grating on my nerves. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TRIPS AND I'M MISSING IT BECAUSE THE DAMN SCHOOL BUREAUCRATS THINK THAT MAKING US GO TO SCHOOL MORE IS GOING TO IMPROVE SCORES WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE IT JUST BURNS PEOPLE OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY GET TIRED AND OVER-WORKED! ... [sigh.]
