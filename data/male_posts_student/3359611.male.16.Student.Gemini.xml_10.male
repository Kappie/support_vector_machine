Apparently, female infiedelity is genetic. This sounds so wrong at first, but in fact, scientific studies on twins and on non-related women have discovered that certain women carry a gene that encourages the lady in question to remain less faithful to their supposed life partner than others.

This raises an odd point. Does this mean the masculine urge to be unfaithful is just with all of us penis-bearing ones from birth? Are we genetical coded to be unfaithful, whoever we are? Surely this gives us a fair excuse? I mean, we cannot be blamed if its in our genes, surely? Its only logic that if our body tells us to, then our mind has no control? I think that if ever a man gets caught with a bit on the side in the future that this should hold as a strong defense. It would be like divorcing someone for farting.

However, another point it raises is the question of how far our birth state influences our behaviour in the rest of our life. If there is a gene that does this, then whose to say there isn't a gene that makes someone act more polite than another, or anything like that. Since our actions are based on our emotions, and the emotions we are feeling are based at least in part to the chemical state of our brain at the time, then surely it makes logical sense to assume that certain personality traits could have been hard coded from birth. The problem is with this is that if it were true, then how much can you blame someone for their actions? Is it right to punish something they are wired to do? We punish pyschopaths, yes, and they are proven to be... 'different'. Yet we almost do this not for the fact this person has behaved morally wrong, but to keep ourselves safe by encouraging a different set of behaviours. Surely, if someone is genetically inclined to steal things, and has no control over whether they do it, it is wrong on our part to cause them pain, emotional or physical, for doing so?
