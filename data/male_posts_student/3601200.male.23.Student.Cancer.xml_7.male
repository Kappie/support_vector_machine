Pay attention!"  I would listen to the rest of the lecture, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people like my teacher wouldrely on me to potentially save their livesforwhat I would become. This carried on throughout grade school.  Finally, when I was free of the horrors of grades one through five, I was able to continue my aspirations unhindered in junior high. Lunch would roll around, afterwards recess. While I played football, I'd drift off once more into my future.  "When I grow up, I want to be a -"  THUMP. The football would fall into my arms and I had to run for my life, lest I be tackled by any number of overweight pre-pubescent children who were more than willing to destroy my lanky, disproportionate body.  I would play the rest of the game, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people like myclassmates would beimpressed bywhat I would become. This carried on throughout junior high.  After junior high came four years of fun; high school. Walking through the halls from one class to the next, I looked forward to what was to be.  "When I grow up, I want to be a -"  "Hi, Clark," said the beautiful girl with the green eyes as I passed her in the hall. I was completely awestruck by the opposite sex, and couldn't remember my initial train of thought. Such things weretorture, however, as I never once went on a date with anyone from my school.  I wouldstruggle through the days, secure in the knowledge that when I grew up people likethe beautiful girlswouldwant to rideme forwhat I would become. This carried on throughouthigh school.  After school, I got a job. I saved every penny for two years. It was then that my heart sank, and my dream died. For that day, when I walked into the doctor's office, I learned that no amount of money could buy a procedure to turn me into a fire engine.
