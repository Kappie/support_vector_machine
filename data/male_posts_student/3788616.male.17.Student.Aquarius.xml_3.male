And, beneath the laughter... i am actually feeling really vexed and upset, but shall explain furtheron...  Anyway, today, we had our 1st MEGA concert practice, and well, haha... damn it lah! My erhu, along with Gary's got left in the bus lah! Everything was like this big drama and a big hooha was played on! Crap! Our erhus were left on the bus simply because we were all late, and the rest of us were busy heliong moving instruments, while the person in charge of brining our instruments down thought that someone else would bring it down lah! what kind of responsibility is that?! Anyway, we searched for like an hour to no avail only to find out that the erhus were left at the damn bus at the last minute! by then, 1/4 of the rehersal was finished! And well, Gary arrived, so we 'suffered' together! haha... Eating while everyone was hard at practice, sleeping and joking when we were meant to be practicing! haha... yeah well, we kind of felt guilty, so we decided to sub 2 other people from playing! haha... Unfortunately, Sujuan was along with Jon Khoo and she kept complaining to me about him at the end, but you didn't hear this from me! haha... anyway, Sujuan and i than pretended to be a married couple, and yes it was done in fromt of Kelly, but it was all for the nature of fun ok! So don't anyhow say! haha... but, it was quite funny lah...  Well, i felt really bad when Kelly kept on getting Jacked by the rest of the CO, and well... i guess, i went to help her, even though initially i joined in lah, but... i kind of hurt to see her like that lah, like she had nothing to protect her against... so yeah, i went to help her, arousing many pretty weird looks... but... i heck care lah, she's more important than what other people may think! Anyway, i don't know lah, i am just going to say i am person with lots off emotions and that i simply like her alot, but feel so drainined, so confused, so tired and not knowing what to do...  Ok, i really need to go eat liao lah... but, let's just say this lah... Kelly, i hope you understand why i do things sometimes and that in time to come, you'll realise what and how i really feel! To the rest! and... haha... To Kelly too... keep smiling! Take care! :p
