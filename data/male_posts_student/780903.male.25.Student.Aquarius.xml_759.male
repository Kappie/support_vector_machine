But I figured it was worth a post on the oddest / funniest moment:  Assistant Secretary of the Interior Lynn Scarlett was talking about the Bush administration and how it's trying to cooperate with industry in order to develop environmental policies, and find ways to get stuff accomplished without necessarily penalizing businesses. She drew an analogy to raising children:  You want to get them to behave through encouragement and role modeling, she said, although “of course sometimes you have to get out the sticks and punish."  Silence.  Awkward chuckle.  She got a confused look on her face and then realized what she'd said.   "Not with children, I don’t mean…. my daughter will vouch that I never used sticks.”  Ha.
