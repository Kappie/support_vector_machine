Jesus, our Lord, can sympathize with the suffering i go through... Jesus walked all through the land and was no stranger to physical weakness.  Jesus, being the infinite God He is, emptied Himself of His divine power and became a man... and poured all of Himself out as a sacrifice for us all.  Jesus was whipped and beaten before His death, whipped by a metal-tipped whip that literally ripped the flesh off His back.  Jesus experienced weakness and endured suffering, even more so than i or any of us have... therefore, He knows what we're going through.  talk to God... He understands what you're going through... He has experienced it fully and completely.
