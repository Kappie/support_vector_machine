After a while, I went to sleep, because I had to get up early to go to work. I woke up at about three or four covered in purple sun tan lotion. It was really cold and sticky, and it ruined my clothes. However, they got it everywhere, and it stained the carpet, so everyone had to stay up forever cleaning except me. Today, at work, I met a very very interesting person....Sorta skanky. It's gonna be real interesting working with her. She made fun of me for being a virgin....I found that pretty funny. From work I came here, and thats about it. Talking to some people and thinking about my situation with these two girls....things just seem to go up and down. I don't know where it's going, and I'm just gonna be really careful. I really don't wanna get hurt again.....Well, I guess that's it. I'll just let time go by and see what happens.
