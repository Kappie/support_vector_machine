I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We're never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth. Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out. I wish I knew. I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with who ever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose, don't have the cure for. Holding on to your grudge. It's so hard to have someone to love. Keeping quiet is hard. Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. - Brand New 'Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't'
