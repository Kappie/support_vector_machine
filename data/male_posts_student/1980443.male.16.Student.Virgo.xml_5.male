I love the little things.  Everything in and of itself is a little thing.  Anything I do with my friends is a little thing - but I love it, and would never trade it for anything, not even a big thing.  I would like to mention just 10 of my favorite little things: - Calling a friend of mine every night ; ) - Playing soccer with Amberto, Hector (myself), Rodriguez, Sanchez, Moses, Victor X, Chiquita, y Maria who play Friday, and we'll beat Martinsville. - Getting an F on my Physics test - Trying to get a job for Saturday at the Purdue game but they didn't want me : ( - My cat dying - Nothing else really, I live a boring life. Cause it's the little things that make you happy, and without them my life would definately be like a college course class on greek - BORING.    That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
