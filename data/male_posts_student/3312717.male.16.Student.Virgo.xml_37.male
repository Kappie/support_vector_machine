Today was the laziest Sunday ever, from a long line of lazy Sundays. I got up at noon and haven't really done anything since then. I'm still in my pajamas.   Tomorrow kicks off the last full week of school. I'm looking forward to that. I think we should just get out of school two weeks early, because no one does anything or puts forth any effort in the last few weeks of school. I think most teachers recognize this and try to get all the important stuff out of the way by the end of the first week of May. But my FST and Chemistry teachers persist in making me work.   I wish I could start on that Gatsby essay. I'm paralyzed with indecision over it. I was going to start it today but I hated to waste a perfectely lazy Sunday working.
