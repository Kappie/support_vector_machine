People really need to get hit upside the head when they think a stock image with the Filter> Render> Lens Flare and red text look good for a poster. Anyways still got Chem. h/w to do. Just got finished play CSX no luck with members this time either. Looking foward to my hockey game Sunday night I sucked last night so I want to have a good game.
