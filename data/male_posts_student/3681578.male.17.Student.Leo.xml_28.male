It was kinda nice having to see the place again after what 2-3 months...anyway, people there were not as I expected them...they were not really that shocked about having a visitor, at least one of my batchmates dropped by each day...so I was the "flavor of the day"...I spent my time mostly with Ms. Jenny who is celebrating here birthday today...and with Engr. dela Rosa, our ultimately the best physics teacher...anyway, so that was it...Ms. Rain was still the same Ms. Rain...weird, eccentric, nice, and um...nothing more...  Oh and wait, I had a conversation with Roda pa pala...she was our former batchmate of mine...former in the sense that she got a scholarship for singapore amidst our third year life which she took...last year though, after her school year there she went back for vacation...she however was not allowed to go back due to health problems...so she has to take senior high school here and behind us by a year...she told me she is now planning to take up AB Political Science...  she is also in IV-Patience, my former section, and I think under the ehem...advisory of Ms. Rain din...  One thing nice about my visit in Risci though was that Mrs. Aguila/Weng/Baby Factory was on leave so I didn't have to see her...anyway, If I did see her...I wouldn't even care to say hi or wave or flinch my head a bit...Hell, I might even dare say "f*ck y**" to her...just for the heck of having the freedom to say those things to a former teacher...  Mind you, she is not my idea of a teacher since a teacher is someone who "teaches"...not someone who is paid to give you exercises alone...someone who should intensively scrutinize our essays and term papers...not someone who gives only 90s and 75s...someone who should show the correct format of writing letters...not someone who publishes a wrongly done promissory note in her periodical test...um, someone who knows the difference between a course in Technical Writing (for sophomores in our school) and English IV...the hell! Isn't it obvious that I like her *note the sarcasm*?!  Anyway, so there...I even made an excuse to go home early...that I was going to UP or going to watch spiderman...mind you both didn't happen because I had decided not to go anymore since I had to prepare for that dreaded tuesday (long test in math) and that ADS essay...  so that's it isn't it...  um...   mwah!
