Well i've been thinking, the pope  mother Terisa? but on an extremely serious note, i would like to make a few comparasions.  Alien vs. Predator -i haven't seen the movie, but those are two of the best movie monsters of all time. my vote defiantly goes to Predator, because not only can he shoot and arsonal of whop ass, he can also... um, well what else does he really need?  Superman vs anybody-  ok there's no real comparison here because whoever thought of superman's powers was obviously not playing by the rules. (however, if denis the menance or bart simpson got a kriptonite pebble, those sling shots could be deadly.)  Spiderman vs Batman-  who am i kidding. hands down, game set and match go to spiderman. besides the fact that spiderman is the greatest super hero to come from marvel comics, lets fact it- Batman is just a rich guy with a fast car and a lot of grappling hook type gadgets.  Catwomen vs Posin Ivy-  who cares who wins, as long as they fight in a mud pit, i think everyone will be happy.  the X-Men vs the Fantastic Four-  we all know that wolverine kicks ass. anyways, the fantastic four really got screwed out of their super powers. the streachy guy would be sliced up real nice by wolverine's animantium claws. the invisible chick would get hit by a car while crossing the street. The flame guy would be extinguished by storm's rain clouds, then hit by lightning, then hit by a giant ball of hail, then laughed at. um i don't know how to kill a rock, but that last guy would probably just drowned or something. so there you have it: the X-Men, Spiderman, and Predator all kick ass!!!! man i want super powers -steve
