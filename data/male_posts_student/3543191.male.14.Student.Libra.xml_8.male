Man i haven't touched soccer for a long long time and today we played it fer hours!I'll jus cut the long story short...bascially right after sch we made for the street soccer court and kicked a few goals and after that we went to Golden Village to have lunch...people that came were Leroy, Cheepong, Thomas, Isaac, Yanming, Aloysius, Guangwei, Zhaoyi, I and another guy who i don't know his name...while everyone was eating Burger King, Leroy and I patronised Old Chang Kee (or Old Chunky)...after eating, we went to neighbourhood 700+ to play soccer again....we started by passing the ball to each other...occasionally the ball will roll down to the road...luckily it didn't get squashed...furthermore it is a new ball...after abit of passing we had an unexpected challenge from Ahmad Ibrahim Sec Sch....I didn't play so i spectated and joked around with those not playing also...unfortunately guangwei got injured...sigh....later we went to the void deck and chatted for a few hours...only Leroy, Cheepong, Isaac, Thomas and I were there..we also played soccer there...I managed to learn a few tricks also...we talked about lots of stuff and I learnt alot about my frens and people i know...finally...it was a long day...I only reached home at about 7pm
