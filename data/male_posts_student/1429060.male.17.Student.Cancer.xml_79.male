I have some meds that I may not take until after exams, because one of the tenporary side effects is...increased anxiety. But only for a short time. Psychiatrist dude also warned me to tell someone if I had suicide thoughts and/or increasing signs of mania(s).  Fun fun.  We talked about a whole bunch of rather interesting stuff - for example, "how many girlfriends have you had?" and "do you have   privelages   with them hint hint". And we talked a whole lot about sex, sexuality, drugs, religion, sex, alcohol, girls at school, friends, sex, medications, disorders that I may develop, sex, etc.  So yeah.  I start to take meds after exams.
