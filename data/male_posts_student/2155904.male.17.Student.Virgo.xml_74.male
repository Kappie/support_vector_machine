Today kinda was an unexpected lax day.  It started off with the Tykester going all night until the late hour of 11:50.  Of course he is talking about sleeping.  What else would he be doing?  Come on.  Apparently the Macaroonanator gave him a call while he was sleeping (he calls early a lot) and first his mom came in while he was sleeping and of course woke him up.  She didn't know that though cuz as she came in she asked in a whisper if he was awake and he opened his eyes to look at her but then quickly realized that he shouldn't do this so he closed them quickly and she then believed he was still sleeping.  Later on though, Tyke's papa came down and also checked to see if he was awake.  So that woke him up also.  So Macaroon basically woke up Tyke twice with one phone call.  Thanks you bastard.  When you don't go to bed until after 1, when would you expect to get up???  He didn't even get that much sleep.  Like 10 hours or so.  Barely even in double digits.  So at like 1 he went over to Macaroon's.  Joining them became Amed and then in an odd twist, DCups came along.  He hadn't hung out with them since summer really.  But it was cool.  They decided to hit up Coug Ridge for some bball.  As they were going outside Kinker finally rolled up on 24s.  Well, not really.  Not even close actually but still.  Tyke was not on in the cold weather when they played 21.  He did pretty well but of course Kinker was going all out compared to the aggressiveness of the rest of the players.  Not that he was going all out but he was playing harder than the rest as usual.  Amed played his usual style.  Which is pretty much indescribable.  Not necessarily in a good way though.  He is just fun to watch.  And he gets a scary face sometimes.  But if you ever want to see some serious arc on a shot...just watch Amed.  That ball goes way up there.  Then they played HORSE and Tyke was off.  He was still tired from 21 and not having anything to eat other than a nAsTy! like protein bar or something like that.  That is still no excuse though.  He got dethroned.  It was a much different game being behind Kinker rather than anyone else.  But he still just flat out missed his shots.  So then he and Amed started their one on one game.  Can you believe that Amed truly believes he can beat Tyke one on one???  Amed is better than you might think at basketball but still, Tyke used to play.  Back in the days of 5th and 6th grade he was pretty much Michael Jordan.  But really Tyke should be able to take Amed pretty handily if he doesn't completely brick every shot.  And if he doesn't just get tired from chasing down loose balls.  You'll hear the results first here though.  Don't worry.  Well, then Tyke, Kinker, and Amed went to BSquare.  Amed finally returned his pants there and apparently argued with them to allow him to get a full refund.  Amed is just like that ya know?  *Here is a little sidenote...Tyke for some reason just had a flashback to about a week ago when he and his mom were talking about their trip to Europe when summer starts (by the way if somebody really wants to go and would be willing to pay their own airfare Tyke's mom would be fine with him/her coming along) and she then started talking about current fashions.  So anyway, she got onto the subject of some of the clothes that girls/women wear now and she said the words pubic hair.  Right after that there was quite an awkward silence.  So then Tyke left and went downstairs.  That is all.  Ok, where was he?  Well Tyke looked at some shoes he wants to get at The Bon.  His bro has ones similar to them or maybe they are the same but he still likes them.  He thinks he would wear them a lot.  Basically loafers.  They had lunch at Orange Julius.  Those smoothies are really quite good.  Strawberry is awesome.  The nachos were pretty spicy but they did the job.  Tyke really wants to just eat stuff now.  Now he is hungry.  He really hates eating at 11:30.  It is just like he should be doing something other than eating, ie sleeping, and then whenever he eats something he gets more energy so he is even less likely to go to sleep.  And then he talks online so he ends up staying up until 1 every night and that is not advantageous.  But he likes to be pensive and was Saturday night.  Seeing as he did nothing and was hella tired (he fell asleep again on his chair watching TV).  So he just sat around and thought about stuff that was on his mind.  He didn't actually accomplish anything by doing this but it is alright.  Nothing was made worse.  Late in the night Macaroon actually got online and he talked to Tyke some.  Not sure what their plans are for Sunday but Macaroon really wants to do anything.  So hopefully they do something fun.  Tyke is planning on making a new mix soon.  Maybe tomorrow if he has time.  He has some ideas for what to put on it but of course he is always up for suggestions of something that is really good.  Dr. Phil probably has some ideas for that.  Well, Tyke's going to go eat some stuff and then probably think about things while he dozes off to sleep.  Here's to the night...
