I hope things are going better, whatever all they are. By the time you read this, and they way you count, only 4 more days, so something to smile about eh?  I went with chris out to cranberry so he could get an ipod. Was fun but didnt get anything out of him, other than how he enjoyed doing 90-95 on the turnpike. He is an asshole as a driver, as usual, but i feel ten times safer than with curry. Curry is going to be the death of me, and yes you are allowed to worry aboot that, cause i do too, lol. Just jokin, giggle giggle?  I might be going to ohio tomorrow night for the weekend, but am unsure right now. I am leaning towards no, cause its a long ass car drive to just go see a bunch of smokers and almost die.  oh yeah, i forgot to ask if you read/liked the last item in the mail that hasnt gotten there. I didn't know if it was a good idea or just corny and me being weird. *shrugs*  I was supposed to go to ultimate tonite, but the mummy acted a bit annoyed with me and so i am getting those brownie points for staying home. I need all that I can get so I can spend as much time with you as I can, or as much as you will put up with me. ;)  Well, that is all for me, prolly gonna watch a movie or two then hit the sack early. I loves yous muchs. *snuggles*
