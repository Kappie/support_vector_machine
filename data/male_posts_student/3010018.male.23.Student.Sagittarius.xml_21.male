No...there are infinite paths we should take...There is more than one path we should take...There is more than one path to the future....the future...it sounds so beautiful....so far away....i always thought that our future was in our hands and it could change if we wanted it to....now i wonder, as i am at the end of my road, if it could be changed at all....if there was anything i couldve done to change this.....why didnt i listen before ? why didnt i listen and try to change things....before it was  too late.......now i am here....before You....i am a man...full of sin...despite my attempts to makes things right....i didnt want to die this way....with more sin than i can atone fore....i didnt want to die this way....................  We are all raindrops falling from the sky, eventually landing on this planet and from the moment we set foot here we are drying up from the heat of the sun. Even if protected by a huge umbrella we never know what tomorrow may bring. Someday we will be blown by the wind and absorbed into the Earth.....  May God's protection be with you always................
