I'm trying to get back to how my "bigdumbgrin" page was. For those of you who never visited that site, it was more focused on stories and essays than the daily activities of my life, that's what my livejournal was for. In the next little while, I want to find a balance between the two on this page.   This is mostly Claytons fault, for asking me all those questions and making me go through the bigdumbgrin archives to find the answer to the religion question. It made me realize how much more fun it is to keep up a site like that.   and now to the shack...
