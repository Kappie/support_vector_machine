Possibly my new favorite movie...I saw the first one when it came out but Vol. 2 I never got around to seeing until today...when we rented it and watched it...and holy cow...amazing. It's got such a great plot. In the first one it seems like it is just a lame excuse to put a lot of gore and fighting, but the second movie explains it all so well!   Great movie. A must see. Tell me what you think if you see it. And has anyone heard anything about the making of a third Kill Bill, because it seems like they did set up for it a bit in the first one (light spoiler coming up ->) when the little girl, Nikki, sees her mother die and Kiddo tells her she'll be waiting if she still feels sour about it when she is older. Post you thoughts in comments...
