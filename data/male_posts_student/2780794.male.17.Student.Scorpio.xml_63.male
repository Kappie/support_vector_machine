They will tell you that if you are ready to work hard, you will be successful and rich. They will tell you that if you are not even willing to listen, you are a loser. They will make you believe that if you fail here, you cannot succeed anywhere else in the world.   Right... Kind of naive, don't you think?   First things first, Singapore is such a small market, too small for so many MLM Companies to coexist. (Go do your maths..) 2nd, Products thay are selling are already on the shelves of established companies. (Go watch some advertisements) 3rd, Not everyone possess the 'Salesman's gift of gap'. 4th, When you are doing MLM, you are not a boss or entrepreneur, you are just a salesman thinking that you are a boss...   Guys.. come on, surely you can figure this out right...   juz some text i cut n paste from a forum~ MLM~ multi-level marketing~ wadya tink of it? lolz~ as tiz person had said it~ It SARKZ!
