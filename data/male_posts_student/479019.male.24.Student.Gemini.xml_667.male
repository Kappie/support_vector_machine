So I drove SeoKyung and Inhye to the Woodbury outlets in Inhye's car. It was a nice little journey. I missed driving. I'd never really talked to Inhye before today. She's nice, but we all pretty much did our own things in the outlet. It was cool getting out of Binghamton for the day. I almost got a jacket at Pacsun, but decided not to. ALthough... it was a jacket perfect for sticking patches on. 4 hrs of driving... afterwards we went to Walmart. I got beer!  I just bought some very expensive  Flogging Molly  tickets. Fuck Ticketmaster! 40% service charges! Motherfucking corporate fucks. Heh... that was fun typing.  Mmm beer.  ***
