But then I watched  The Pelican Brief  - tis a great movie. It stars Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington and is based on a John Grisham novel about two Supreme Court justices being assasinated and Darby Shaw (Roberts) inadvertently gets stuck in the terrible situation. Great movie, except for the fact that it ends the same way Grisham's other movies end (The Client and The Firm).  "The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder." - Alfred Hitchcock.
