I would always think "Pfft, what has RSS ever done for me" then i saw a little link on  urlLink Lancearthur.com  saying "add to  urlLink My Yahoo! ". So lo and behold My Yahoo! now supports RSS feeds. I now understand why RSS is such a beautiful thing.  It means that i can check if most of my commonly read blogs have updated at once instead of going from blog to blog to blog. and now i am going to figure out how to make an RSS feed of my McBlog.
