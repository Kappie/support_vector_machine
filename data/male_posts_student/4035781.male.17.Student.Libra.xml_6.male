Today, today... what can I say about today? It was on the most part a good day. I am now the proud owner of a six foot bo staff made of red oak, even bought it myself despite being under eighteen. Now I can train for kobuto kata at home, for those who are interested I train in the Shito-Ryu style of karate and the bo staff happens to be my favorite weapon. Today my feet seem to have a mind of their own, my house has become confining. All this energy and enthusiasm and I have no one to share it with today. It's criminal in it's own right... "Ihave will, I am fit, how could it have come to this?" Iron Maiden - The Mercenary. Still, partly my fault for not clearly making plans in advance. You know it's creepy how horiscopes can be perfectly right, I normally don't buy into this sort of thing but take a look at this.   Libra July 25   Your dear ones will be startled at what tumbles from between your lips. Should you stop? Not unless a secret you swore to hold to your grave is involved.   Libra July 26   If you're wondering where your people-pleasing, cooperative personality went -- well, wonder no longer. It's just your turn to be assertive. Enjoy it. You know you've been craving it.   Well the 25th was yesterday, and indeed... I felt like a freaking poet all day, could hardly stop talking. As for the 26th, yes I am feeling rather assertive and it's been working out for me. In relation to that I have been cleared by my folks to take driving lessons and for insurance. Driving will bring freedom, I can't wait to spread my wings. I have been waiting to see a friend of mine in Edmonton for over a month now and I still haven't been able to get a ride. Besides that I will now be able to get around better in the late hours (even if I have to sneak through a window or two). So, all in all besides a setback in plans tonight it's been a good day.   What has been on the forefront of my thoughts today... love, hate, fate. Firstly, what is it to be in love? I know no one can exactly describe what it feels like to be in love. To care deeply for another? Just to think of that special someone and a smile touches your lips? Hmmmm *ponder*. As for hate, the opposite of love. I can't honestly say I hate many people. It's not a feeling I care for so I don't dwell on it. Fate... is there such a thing as fate? I believe everyone crafts their own destinies through the choices they make in life. Choices, decisions, the mark of how one chooses to live. Every choice leads down another path, that path inevitably leads down to another choice. There are times when guidance is an important part of decision making as well. One could easy be lost in the woods without a guide, yes? I feel in confident my decisions have been the best ones possible to make at any given moment. As I said earlier I live without regrets, I wouldn't change a thing.  D
