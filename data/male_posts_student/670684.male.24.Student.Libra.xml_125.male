The Smoking Gun ... Showdown With Saddam ... America's Vigilante War on Terrorism .  So it's refreshing to see in other countries, there are newspapers working on  urlLink telling it like it is .  I'll be honest, the zealous rhetoric that Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and the Fox News jackasses stir can sometimes get me caught up in it...it's tough to emulate Stuart Hall and find the resistance reading in everything...sometimes you need help.  Thus, I'm looking overseas, where people might have a better perspective of the regime it looks like we're going to vote another four-year term.  The good part about Bush's shenanigans is that it's drumming up a lot of anti-Bush support from anyone left of fucking crazy.  The bad part is, the Democrats are too busy playing teabag to do something about this.  All I need is one Democrat who is running for President (and isn't Al Sharpton) to tell me that he's against war and he's got my undying support.  And none of this against war in the right circumstances backtalk bullshit.  I want him naked as the wind, both hands on the table in front of him, a bunch of sex-starved foreigners behind him who will pounce if he tries to weasel his way out of it, telling me that he is against war and can solve the War on Terror without fighting.  Yes, yes, it can be done.  And fairly easily.
