Vincente Padilla 9.  AJ Pierzynski 10.  Shea Hillenbrand 11.  Edgardo Alfonso 12.  Jeff Weaver 13.  John Thompson 14.  Hee Sop Choi 15.  Dave Roberts 16.  Tom Glavine 17.  Chris Reitsma 18.  Rod Beck 19.  Juan Castro 20.  Mike Redmond 21.  Rey Ordonez  Of course, I am very pleased with how things turned out...but that's how drafts always end up.  Some great initial picks (Sosa, Millwood, Smoltz, Edmonds), a few guys of good value who dropped (Hillenbrand, Padilla, Choi, Thompson), and a few real sleepers that I stole and could have boom or bust years (Alfonso, Roberts, Glavine, Beck).  I mean, Glavine is the #1 pitcher on the New York Mets, and I got him at 16th round.  In an NL-Only League!  Best pick of the draft...and not too far behind is Rod Beck in 18th round...granted, he's out until May, but he'll give me 30 holds when he gets back, and I'm deep enough to withstand.    Rey Ordonez doesn't play for anyone right now.  I had the last pick in the draft.  Nostalgia purposes.    Screenwriting draft on Wednesday.  Lots of beer and ridicule.
