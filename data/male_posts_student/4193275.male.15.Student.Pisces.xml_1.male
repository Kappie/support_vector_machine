Right now though, I want to physically rip out my throat (is that possible?) in order to end the irritation.  Heh, it reminds me of the episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm when Larry had a pubic hair stuck in his throat. (I don't have that though)  I am now officially obsessed with the Olympics, although I'm going away on Saturday so will probably miss most of the second week, which is fucking criminal. I've changed my mind about loving all Chinese people after they beat us in the Badminton thing, but I still love the main Chinese person (he's just so clever).  Oh my God, I have to write down my dream - it won't make sense to anyone reading it, but I like to record the best dreams that I have, and this is as good a place as any to do it.  My family did  something  to our house (I'm not sure what, but it basically resulted in us having an entirely different, and much bigger and better, house) and so for some reason we took in loads of lodgers. There was an American woman whose name I've forgotten, another woman called Patty, a man called Brian, this really cool psychologist woman who I love called Jenni Trent-Hughes, I think there might have been a couple but I'm not sure, and my two aunties on my mum's side. Also, Coventry was somehow by the sea, so the American woman was asking me lots of questions about the sea, such as how deep is it, and do I like to swim in it (I was getting quite annoyed with her). Ooh, and also I was auditioning to be on a quiz show, and for some reason this involved me having to fight an enormous monster, which I managed to kill just before it killed me. For the second audition I wanted to wear a shirt which I couldn't find, my mum had hidden it somewhere and I couldn't find it, and when I was looking for it I woke up and realised that I don't live by the sea, I don't have a huge house, I don't live with a load of cool other people, and I have no chance of appearing on a quiz show in the near future. I was so pissed off.  Daniel  P.S Oh yeah I got my AS Maths result which was a C, and as I was expecting a U, that was pretty cool.
