She turned me down a few days ago without me asking, basically, on the grounds that she'll be going to Uni in a year (she's in L6). I don't know whether the fact that I tried makes me a git. Fact is I really want to be with someone. I feel so non-ident on my own.  Also, Patrick H., I meant you. I'm not gay, or even bi, and in that, I'm not attracted to you per se. But I do think you're the most beautiful bloke I've met. I was going to ask you on MSN (h/e you never seem to be on at the same time as me) if you'd mind doing a photo shoot for me of some of your free-running - seeming as though you read my blog maybe it's an idea to do it on here. Your choice, if it'd be 'weird' then it doesn't matter. I just wanna get some proper movement photos, and free-running has a definite elegance to it.  Apparently I look like the little reporter guy from 'Almost Famous'. I disagree - I consider him to be more of a cross between Brendan and Dan. If you haven't seen the movie, I recommend you do on grounds that it's an uncanny cross. Actually, I think both of you read this?  Oh, and in the manner of Ging (who is cool), I have to express my feelings about Jazz - I looove her, in the same plutonic manner as Ging loves Laura. I dunno, she's about as mad as me so we kinda fit!  My new song at NJaN practice didn't go so well. I'll try again next week and if it doesn't work then I guess I could sneak it into an album, just record every single instrument myself. Cause unless we can work it out next week then I reckon that it'd have to be that every part was quite dull. Oh well. Side note, Libby came to see us all today. Nice Libby.  Quote of the day: "Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? While we see it your way, Run the risk of seeing that our love will soon be gone."
