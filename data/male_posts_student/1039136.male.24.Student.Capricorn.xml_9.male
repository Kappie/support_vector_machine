This isnt the complete advice article on how to be successful, since i havent totally determined EVERY variable that brings about success. Perhaps success isnt totally in our control anyway, perhaps there has to be some "outside help" to success. Just think about the last thing that happened in your life..successful or otherwise. THink about how many tiny little minute things had to happen preceding the event up until the very moment that the event actually happened.  Think about how if just one of those things was out of place it could have caused the event to not happen at all.  It makes you wonder if any facet of this life was preplanned...  Anyway here's 2 tips for you..some good advice ..some i've heard and some i've come up with myself:  Don't take NO for an answer. There is no reason in life why you cant get exactly what you want.  First, dont ask questions, rather use statements.  That way someone is less likely to respond in a negative manner.  In this case you have to be careful not to sound like a dictator. Most of the time when people tell you NO, they dont have a good reason, or the reason they have isnt as good as they think.  Don't give up until NO becomes YES. If you want something...go and get it. Don't let anything get in your way, especially some jackass telling you NO.  Don't try to do everything on your own...delegate responsibility.(thanks to Matt "Chester" Phelan for sparking the thoughts on this one) This one is officially useful for you leader types out there like me.  Many times people end up pulling their hair out because they have so much to do and so little time. The great part of having friends and family is that they can help you out if you need it.  Most of the time, people will be happy to help you out since it seems that everyone is almost always bored. You must be wise in choosing who help you in doing what.  For example if you needed someone to pick up certain alcohol for a party, it would be useless to assign the job to someone under the age of 21...it would also be useless to ask someone who has 3 brain cells to do it because chances are they won't be able to get the job done correctly..so maybe you can have the person that is under 21 pick up the munchies for this party and the other dumbass can fget the babes for the  party because usually really dumb people are good at people skills. The point here isn't how to throw a good party, its how to find the right people help you on the road to success. Befriend a computer dork, a grease monkey, a mafia hitman, a chef, a nightclub bouncer, a bartender, etc etc... People like to feel useful...make them feel useful...think about it, people become things so they can be used for those things...we are life whores~!  Remember kids...if you want me to write about a certain topic, or respond to any questions, either im them to me JMS504 or email..jms504@juno.com
