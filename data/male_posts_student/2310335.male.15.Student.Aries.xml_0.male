So I shall write about yesterday’s happenings First of all I had no plans to go to school but then I had to give my interview for head boy Ohk so It started with a boring assembly, with the big C telling us to stay away for PPC, and we would have to wear some stupid badges next year. And then we had the first 2 periods all to ourselves with us having nothing to do and also only 8 ppl were present. (Tanya shukla wasn’t, have mercy)  Also, I was called by the bio teacher to do some typing work which I did in a jiffy After which I went to the big V for my interview but she was busy so she called me l8r. I had to pull up my tie and close my cuff buttons after every period Then was French in which Pranav and I had a race to the Estate office to get a marker (we had one of these earlier also) in which I emerged victorious (jus like last time) And I almost forgot our class also had a period with Tom’s class which was fun, but there is nothing much to write about that Moving on…. We were made to sit in a neighbouring class that was having maths but it was fun Then we went down one floor to see a Smartclass presentation Well the presentations are good but are awfully hilarious too Last period My interview I went to the big V’s office Pulled up my tie, closed the buttons She offers me a seat Her first question, “Why wasn’t your name given?”(just like every other teacher’s) I was then asked about what all I could do. These are the following things I mentioned: 1.	Ze ExunClan 2.	Ze digex clan 3.	Ze ed board 4.	And Ze music She was really impressed Then I was told that there was going to be only one head boy, but they had lotsa other gr8 ppl for the post so they were thinking of making them prefects or something So she asked me whether I would like to b a prefect or not Well, how could I say no? Her next question, “ What would you do if there was a fight?” My quick answer break it up “How?” I said I just would break it up in any way coz I keep breaking up fights and it aint a big deal for me “But what would u do if someone like ekansh malik had a fight?” “Ma’am ill just break it up, there’s nothing to worry about” Well it ended with some other questions Good thing for me On a second note, I had had a fight with a very good friend of mine (a girl, ppl do not get any ideas) on Wednesday. We talked yesterday but we jus kept fighting That’s a bit irrelevant though Thanks to Mr. Karan Misra for mentioning my blog And Mr. Az gays and others, you guys can add a link to my blog
