But man, those KING 5 people: they started the whole session off by with my dad saying, "I'll be glued to the internet." Oy vey. Then they had shots of him looking through the University of Puget Sound's observational telescope, which looked corny. OY VEY. To top it off, they referred to my dad as "Instructor Bates". OYY VEYYY. But my dad still got on TV, which is awesome, so OMG to that. Now for THE  OMG , I got an e-mail from Neil today! (Neil is in Europe for around 3 weeks).  If this is Max or Fred, I've already sent you guys the message. I'll post a scan of a print soon. One more OMG, the Flash movie should be done, published, and all that Jazz by Friday. Keep an eye out for it. Syonara.
