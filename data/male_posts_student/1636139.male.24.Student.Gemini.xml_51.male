The prof started out by going over the differences between classical  quantum physics, then proceeded to explain the math used to describe quantum mechanics. 
I noticed that I seemed to be one of the very few people in the class that was following along; the rest looked hopelessly lost. I suspect that my strong Math background courtsey of UW helped a lot as there was a considerable amount of linear algebra involved. 
  
I was impressed by how clearly the prof was able to explain the concepts behind quantum cryptography - yes, he used Alice, Bob  Eve - once he had gone through the required quantum mechanics preamble. I certainly learned a lot in this class, especially about polarized light.
