However , I do have a lot of friends who are crazy about F1.Vijai, a friend of me invited me to watch the Spanish Grand Prix at a Pub on Full Screen . Though I haven't watched much F1 , I have played a lot of Motor Racing games on Sony PS-2 and hence found the race to be extremely interesting yesterday.It was Schumi again and a 1-2 for Ferrari .                             Found F1 to be a pretty interesting sport and intend to follow it much more closely in the future.
