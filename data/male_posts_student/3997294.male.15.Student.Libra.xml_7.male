All I did was tell them about my blog and my forum and they go psycho. Anyhow I can't really do much about it. They are going to believe themselves anyhow. No matter how I present the truth they see it as a attack aimed at them. It really is ok I will keep praying for them and for me that I will be open to what they say too. I was reading my bible and I saw this verse that kinda seem to fit   Mark 6:11  "Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them."
