But then i remembered that we're painting so i changed to something that i wouldnt mind getting dirty, namely some old jeans and an old black Nike tee.  My brothers decided to go outside and play basketball while my parents and i went to see our new house b4 dropping me off at church. As we pulled up into the driveway, we saw that our future neighbours beat us to the incomplete, rubble-ridden driveway, so we parked on the soon-to-be curb.  The drywall i think its called is up, and the rooms really look like rooms now.  My room is slowly getting smaller, but it'll by MY room nevertheless, instead of "me and my brother's" room.  I checked out my lil bro's room, even smaller than mine.  My parent's room was quite large, larger than their current room i believe, and they got a walk-in closet and their own bathroom... HOW UNFAIR!!! lol... I left after like 5 mins cuz i was kinda getting tired of going there and my parents were filling our house wit cigarette smoke :( ... 15-20 mins later, my parents finally left and we made our way to church On the way there, i feel asleep for about the last 20 mins of the 30 min trip while listen to my MD.  lol, it was funny cuz i remember dreaming i was playing basketball.  I recall some1 shooting the ball, and the ball bouncing off the rim, off the board and back to me... so naturally, i put my arms down and swing them up to gain momentum as i jump up to grab the board... just my arm swinging wakes me up just in time to see my mom turn around i say, "ur tired eh?" lol, i felt like such a looooser... but i played it off like it was nothing to my mom. Finally, at 7 on the dot i got out of the van and wave to my parents as they drive off.  I went downstairs, past the Korean ppl, past the kindergarten room, and into the gym where i met the suprised expressions of ppl who aren't used to seeing me at church wednesday nites, esp 2 in a row...  anyways, after getting a quick painting tutorial from Aaron, i went to work wit Matt and those 2 sisters whose names i cant think of rite now (sorry)... after 30 mins of intense work, i went inside the future youth room to chill wit Matt, where we talked about nothing and played "can u guess that rock band?" a game that i couldnt win if my life depended on it.  After throwing around one of those dirty large circular scrubbing pads that u put on the bottom of a buffer like a frisbee, Martha came in to give us some exciting news: SHE'S GOING TO BRAZIL!!!!!!  Ok... now for the dark side of me... If i was truly the great friend that i thought i was, i woulda been happy that everything worked out.  Cuz u see, 2 days things were looking so bad that one quoted "it would take a miracle for everything to work out", shortly followed by "but everything is possible with God"... well she was right, everything is possible and sometimes it happens!!  Sadly, being the greedy, ungrateful, horrible friend that i am... at that exact instance where she broke the news... i did not feel joy.  It's hard to say what i did feel, i definetly felt sadness, as i will miss the person who i talk to the most over msn... but, the dominate feeling was... almost anger, i dunno at who, maybe at Martha for leaving me, but... maybe at God for making everything work out... I KNOW!! I know... its SOOO greedy of me!! Like one of my most cherished friends just got the opportuinty of a life time, and here i am wondering what im gonna do during the nite!! Martha, God, im so sorry, plz forgive me... Dont worry, shorlty after those feelings i realised how horribly wrong i was in thinking that, and i praised God for sorting things out... Well, to continue with the evening, finally one of the ppl who were actually working finally got me and Matt to go back into the gym to work, but the she left herself... :S.  Martha went home but we had Ada to help our cause.  In the gym, me and Matt were "supervisors" meaning we stood there and watched, while every1 else continued to paint... i most say, it was looking fresher, newer, better in the sense that the cracks and stuff were all gone.  The colour choice, not my personal favourites, but last time Pastor Aaron tried to let us choose the colours, well come see our old youth room and find out :P Before long, some1 gave me the prestigous job of "brush cleaner"... joy... lol, i think that i am quite possibly the WORST brush cleaner in the history of Forward... it just wouldnt get clean!!! Well they didnt give me much to work with, a moderaately large sink, running water and hands -_-... no scrubbing utensil, bad lighting, and most of all a secluded location.  Anyways, at 9:30 we were done, most of the ppl had left by then, just me, Pastor Aaron, Robbie, Matt, and Aaron's sis left.  Aaron's sis left shortly afterwards, leaving just us guys.  Unfortunately, the only reason we were all there was cuz my parents, who i said to pick me up at 9:30, hadn't arrived yet, at 9:45, Aaron reluctantly told me that he had to go, despite the fact that i wanted to go since we first finished.  Being the great guy he is, he didnt wanna leave me alone, so he stayed even tho it was jepordizing his prior plans.  But just as he said that, my familiar blue Toyota Previa pulled up and every1 left happily in a flurry of waves and handshakes... On the way home we stopped by at Blockbuster where i found a great deal: $10 for Shenmue II, a great game by the way.  It has a mix of adventure and story line, but the same fighting engine from the acclaimed Virtua Fighter series, a must buy at $10 dontchya think?  when we got home, i played till 12:30ish (late for me) and went to sleep.  Today was good.  I woke up, did the usual (sc/msn) and remembered that it was Victoria day (i think its called).  I didnt have any plans so it didnt make any difference, but one of my friends invited me to a bbq, something woulda loved to have gone to but had no reasonable source of transportation as my parents had left and i wasnt sure if the buses were running (ya, i dont drive, i dont even have my G1 T.T).  Instead, i made plans wit a friend to run some sc, which he owned me in, and then some ball.  My bro ruined our sc as he unintentionally caused me to dc (disconnecnt) every 2 minutes.  At about a little before 6, he came to my door and we went to the courts.  Shortly afterwards, my brother arrived and we ran some "pump".  Most ppl dont know what pump is, but its a variation of "american" where u can perform a "put back" or alley-oop the ball in the air to steal 3 points from the person who first missed.  For the basketball unfaithful, american is pretty much every-man-for-themselves where first to 21 wins.  In american, ther person wit the best shooting or 1 on 1 skill usually wins, but pump makes the game so much more intense cuz at any moment an opponenet can gain 6 pts on u from something as insignificant as a missed shot.  Well i didn't win a single game, we played about 5 times, the last one i got to game point but my friend who was at 18 won off a pump... -_-, good times tho. During our games, some brown (no offense to ppl with the stereotypical word) ppl arrived and played on another net... lol, it musta been a family affair cuz there were at least 20 of them.  We finally challenged them, and MURDERED them, i think the score was 7-1.  2nd game, more of the same, 11-? (not more than 5 i think).  Then those ppl went to the opposite court, and we sat around talking.  10 mins or so later, they called us to their new court and challenged us, so we owned them again 11-4.  Then they got a decent team together, the game was INTENSE... they were up 10-8, their posession.  Their main play maker missed a pull jumper at the elbow and my friend crashed the board.  Im not sure what order it happend but my friend, whos prolly has prolly the best 1on1 skills amongst my wide range of ball friends, hit a sweet pull-up at about 3 pt.  Then he and I ran the old-school pick and roll, which was working beautifully all day, and i made the open lay-up :D.  So now its 10-10, win by 2 (standard rules), and 2 open shots later we won!!! YAY!!! But WOW!! the game after that we got "ruined"!!! Well the final score wasn't so bad: 11-6, but that doesnt show how we played... we were getting out rebounded horribly!! They changed their weakest player for some1 wit good height, good ups (jumping ability) and a solid drive.  My man starting playing better D and they started double teaming me in the post, forcing me to kick out to my bro who suddenly started missing the shots that he usually "wets".  I missed a 2 foot shoot, the pressure got to me... guess im still just a noob/rookie to the game... Guess practice doesnt always make perfect, u need some in-game experience to go with it.  Guess I'll be at the courts a little more often...   PS.  In case this is the last post u read i wish u bon voyage, our hearts and prayers are with u, u will be greatly missed T.T... in comemeration of ur leaving, the countdown has alrdy started here and on my msn...  35 dayz till ur back in my arms......(symbolically speaking of course)... hehe
