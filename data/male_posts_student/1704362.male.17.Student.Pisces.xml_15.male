Someone has signed on to AIM. In a near-impossible feat of speed, Jim sits up, deftly swooping the cursor to the taskbar and opening the AIM buddy list. With eager anticipation, Jim lobs a casual "Hi" at the person, cleverly disguising his desperate need to alleviate his boredom through social interaction. Prepared to pounce on the keyboard like a tiger and respond in a split-second, Jim waits. And waits. The person ignores Jim and puts up an away message, probably consisting of nonsensical song lyrics or angsty teenage poetry. Jim slumps back in his chair and shakes the Vanilla Coke can above his head to retrieve the precious last drops.    Suddenly, he hears it...    ...And it continues. On the rare occasion that a person responds, that an actual conversation is initiated, the other party discontinues it in short order. This is probably due to    distraction  "OOH! Look at that grass grow! Whoo-eee! This is much more interesting than talking to Jim!"  fear  "Okay, Jim IMs me every single time i get on within a second. That's freaking me out."  revulsion  "Doesn't this loser have anything better to do?"  sympathy  "The poor guy. Maybe if i don't talk to him he might actually get a life." or, last but not least, simple  sadism ! "Heh heh... I know how much Jim wants to talk to me... so i'm just going to ignore him."  So help out an obsessive compulsive AIM user and IM him. Now.  End Transmission. (It's  "NerveStaple" )     NOW LISTENING TO: Rob Dougan - Clubbed to Death (Hybrid Remix)
