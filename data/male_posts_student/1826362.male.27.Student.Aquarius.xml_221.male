Was the rack too close to the heating element?  was there a typo in the recipie? Whatever the reason, after 7 minutes I went to turn the fish over, and they were a little crisp on that side.  That wasn't that big a deal, but then the smoke alarm started going off.  And the celings are too high to reach to shut it off.  So we were waving pants at the alsrm to get the smoke away.  I went to finish the salmon while lauren stood on a chair and fanned the alarm.  But as we all know, heat and smoke rises, so lauren inhaled a lot of smoke, got it all in her eyes, the entire apartment filled with smoke, and the fish tasted gross.
