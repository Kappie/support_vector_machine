Actually, it was at the end, that I found out I got 67% on my exam. Ugh...so my aim for an 80s final in English will be thwarted, as my exam mark is what's pulling my mark at the moment. So if I'm lucky I'll be stuck at a 78 yet again, and if I say do do amazing on final assignments then MAYBE I'll get back to an 80....which I would be very happy with =). At the moment though...yeah my mark isn't exactly the best....but meh 78 I'm not complainin'. Beats 72.....in careers, which luckily got bumped to 82. So now I'm just hoping for the best for the rest of my year. It's a given my average will be over 80...but I wonder if I'll get that piece of copper signifying I got over 85 average this year...  First day back from holidays was pretty usual usual.....got to school around 8am today since Patrick needed to grab sometin', and I needed to go talk to Mrs. Wharton anyways. Kinda funny though, it seemed as though school started pretty quickly anyways. 15 minutes passes by pretty quick. So before I knew it, class started, I handed in my music critique thing, and got 12/10 on my music log =).  That summed up most of my music class. Other things that happened included my music test reschedule to next Monday, and also notified that solos are in 2 weeks. Yeah I gotta get working on that.....blasted high A flat is still hard to hit. Oh yeah....and next year if I do well enough....I can do no work in gr. 11 music for theory =). So come on theory exam....whoop ass =).  Science class was next...where we basically did review for next day's test.  Lunch went to Jasper's. Food. Yup....what else to say I don't know.  And summing up my afternoon.....heh the format of this blog kinda changed....but oh well the Calgary game's on....and I gotta study for civics....so here it goes:  -Biology Bellringer: Smelly and I think I did OK. -English: Bombed essay...Yup....  That's pretty much it. Then I slept for 3 hours....and yeah.....go away now.  Later.
