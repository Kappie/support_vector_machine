More links to follow.  +MacMan  UPDATE:    For everyone who is still interested in a Gmail account check out the Gmail Machine link on the right.  The Gmail machine is like a Gmail lottery.  The machine randomly generates a number every time you click the refresh button.  The object is to "hit" the number 1337.  If you are lucky enough to do this you will recieve a brand new never been used Gmail invite.  Props to Scott and Kevin for the great idea.  -MacMan
