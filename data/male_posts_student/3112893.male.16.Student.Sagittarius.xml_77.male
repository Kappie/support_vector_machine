Just gimme some time to sleep and stuff and I'll be back to my excessively posting self :-).  I feel kinda guilty though for troubling people to come and then not posting at least a little something. And I mean, yeah, sure, I didn't ask anyone to specifically come and check this blog out, but still, if people are gonna come, I feel I should do something for them, kinda like how my irish friend would sometimes drive into Watertown from Allston and just stop by for tea and crackers or something like that. I didn't invite him or anything, but it was always great to see him and talk to him so the cost of the tea and my expensive crackers that he'd munch like one would saltines with clam chowder. It was worth all the trouble though, even when I didn't want to go through it. And come to think of it, this analogy's a pretty loose fit, but I like the story so I'll leave it here.  Moving on, I bought a couple Dire Straits albums and a couple singles from the iTunes Music Store and I've been listening to them all day. I particularly like  urlLink Sultans Of Swing . I just think that the guitar in that song is so awesome and I could just sit and listen to the couple solos in there and try to practice them all day. It's just so cool to me how someone can do that. I want to do that.  Moving on, I'm feeling a little better now so I think I'll just write a full post about my day. After buying the songs, I got to my hard work of practicing guitar, reading the news, checking my buddy list, reading assorted blogs, and the like. Meanwhile, my dad was moving shit up and down from the attic all day until he got to the tables, which he needed help with. In the process of moving them up the stairs to the attic, we managed to break a window that I ended up picking up the glass to. I didn't get cut or anything though, which is really good because I hate sucking wounds for hours on end.  Anyway, after that brief period of strenuous exercise, I went back to my extremely busy work schedule and listened to more Dire Straits and read more news, read more blogs, wrote a couple posts, played some more guitar, and talked online. After doing all this extremely hard work, I decided that it was a good a time as any to finish up my work for one of the recommendation letters I'm getting from UCLA so I whipped out the CDs that I brought from LA and put the proper one into the drive, copied over the files and was working until about 45 minutes ago. Over the time I was working, Erik came over and he and my dad discussed more business. My dad just left to take Erik back to his place about 20 minutes ago and I've been looping Sultans Of Swing since around 9PM and I'm still not sick of it. I imagine my dad will get back pretty soon, and I think that just about covers everything anyway.  My thoughts of the day were pretty bla, but I did solidify a few things in my mind. I'm going to find and get a job using the skills that I've accumulated over the years in my effort to get into MIT to make some money so that I can afford my expensive life-style. I think this'll be really good for me, and my dad supports it. He's been through A LOT, so I trust him with a lot in terms of my choices in life. I trust him because he's a genuine guy who would never lie to me when it mattered. Not that he reads this, but I want to thank him for being there when he was, despite all his shortcomings because without him, I can't imagine where I'd be now.  That is all. -- Feanor
