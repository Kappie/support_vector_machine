Today... went to the festival of Praise... with the Hillsongs... the praise and worship was good... and i realise lots of things... and this verse always come into my mine... Matthew 6:33 " first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you..."... what is the all these things... all these things is the things that we worried about the things we desired to have... To me i guess may be Hammy hampy and Lust... these are the great stronghold of mine... but i guess... after today... i lift them up to God... God will handle them... do not have to worry about all the things of the world... i shall serve full time ... serve my brothers full time... give them all my time... in bringing them nearer to God each day...  Dunno what happening to me today... seems like i having PMS like that... having very bad mood... never had these feeling before... but i just know that its time... The Change of dynamic/system of the cell... something needs to be done... Philadelphia will make a come back and give the Devil a big kick in his fat ass... God... please help me...
