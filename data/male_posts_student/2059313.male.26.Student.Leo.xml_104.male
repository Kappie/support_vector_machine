       
      Thank You God!  For helping me to realize that something was broken and needs mending.  Thank You for overwhelming my heart today as I left the funeral home, and thank You for my heart.  Thank You for my loyalty and my devotion to helping out a friend when they really need it most (or at least appears to me that they need it).  I couldn't have been who I am without You.  Or with out your help, friend.
