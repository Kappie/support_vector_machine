Imagine Nader way out on the fringe Left, further left than the nutty Howard Dean (if that can be contemplated by the human mind).  Nader will force Dean to tack Left, trying to peel the nutcase lobby away from Nader.  How can Dean convince the street anarchist that he is their man, while at the same time appealing to the centrist?  Bush can thank Nader for his presidency because of the Gore voters who threw it all away on Ralph.  I don't think Bush will need Nader this year, but a Nader presence would increase the entertainment factor immeasureably!  Go Ralph.  Oh, did you know that Environmental Socialists are now called 'Watermelons'?  Green on the outside and red on the inside....just passing it along.
