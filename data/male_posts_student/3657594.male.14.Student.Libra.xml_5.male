The company's newest game is called soaker tag, and it will rid the world of gun murders.  The point of this game is to use your super soaker to wash away a patch located on the opponents arm.  I am convinced that eventually, everyone will get so used to shooting at people's arms that no one will have enough aim to shoot the head or heart.  So in the future we wont have to worry about getting shot and dying, we will just have really sore arms.
