Practically every corner of my eye, there's an advertisement, but today when i was taking themrt, the board around the escalator, tat indicates how long the mrt will reach the station.... another advertisement, just when i was worried that i might not catch the train on time and im running late. Andthe best ting is... itrepeated the advertisement countless time andit didnt showhow many mins the trainwill bereaching.. So?I just have to walk faster just in case the train reached already. So inconvenient.. What's important to meis how many mins, not howmuch is the product.. Come on man, why cantthey just leave some importantboardsalone?Haiz.... Why like that? WHY???   Mycolleague smsed me at 9am plus two days ago, to ask whether i got a digicam. But, i read the msg and went back to sleep, so i forgot all about it until today. So i smsed him and told him, ya i got and i am bringing.. Tinking he doesnt have a digicam andhe just wanted to borrow mine to take the pics of the kids..   But then, when i reached, he asked me, "Did u bring the cable to connect to the computer? I need to send some pics back to the company by 3pm" I was like SHIT, i dunno he needed it so urgently, and before i can say sorry, he said: "Never mind, i got bring digicam and cable."   I'm like "............................................................................................." Really speechless, if he already got the cam and cable, why did he ask me to bring in the first place?To tink tati was worriedfor a while somemore... Haiz, why like tat? WHY?????   Anyway, im hooked on a jap anime series now, called Naruto.. Okok, i know im a bit slow, i heard about it a couple of months back, but im lazy to download..lol (guess its not a good excuse)..Its just so concidencial that my Sim Course-mate burn the episodes on cds, so shelent me the series until 57episode,haha going toborrow more tomorrow! yes! *Sorry "niece", for mentioning tis=X*       Favourite naruto character, Kakashi Gaara, i just find them cool     Current Mood: Why like that?
