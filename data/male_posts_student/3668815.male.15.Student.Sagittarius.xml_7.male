It has been a very eye-opening thing fer me , as i fell in love with a girl , a girl whom wasn't supposed to be with me. And i have hurt her many times. I feel guilty , but , i really cannot do anything , except wishing her in all areas of life , and praying fer her... thats all... I've really tried my best to make it last long , but as people say , this kind of love wun last long , as love is not a simple thing... Love , four-letters , easy to spell , but difficult to get out of it... humans are physically strong , but they are mentally weak. Things happened too fast fer me to stop it... Wad's done , cannot be undone , maybe serperating is the best choice fer both of us ba...  Many of us thinks that love is just by being a girlfriend , boyfriend , but there is more to it... much more. So much that i cannot understand it totally.  Maybe at this point of time , someone can cheer me up ?   Hopes: To have someone to listen to all my troubles , problems , sovling difficulties with me... having fun together... is it alot ?    Why is it that my love life is so unsuccessful ?!?!?!  ARGH !!!!!!!!!
