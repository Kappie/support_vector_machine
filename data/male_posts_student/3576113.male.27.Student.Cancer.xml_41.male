Course then there's things like serendipity, soul mates, and the lottery.  To chose or not to choose... I mean how good are you really?  Fences are pretty comfy I hear.  There will be another train right? Smile.  Trees are awesome, swaying in the wind, and wind like a caress.  A rocker on the front porch, fishing with feet dangling in the water, a cliffside sunset, and a cause worth fighting.  Absolute trust in ones eyes, a hand waiting to leed, and a shoulder in need.  All said in a glance, a mischevious wink, the secret of two.
