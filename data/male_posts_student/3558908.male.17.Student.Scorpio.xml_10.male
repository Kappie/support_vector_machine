This is like the mood ring in the present only it is a cubicle or a room that changes its texture, color, design etc depending on the mood of its current owner. Of course there is a default color of the cubicle when no one is using it. The default color is dark blue and the texture of it is smooth. Maybe the favorite color of the original inventor and designer of the mood cubicle is dark blue? no one knows.. That is the future anyway.   The texture of the cubicle can be changed by the user according to his mood or what he wants. If the user does not want to choose the design of his cubicle, he can just sit in a digital chair and relax for a moment. After that, the main system will analyze his mood, attitude and all that is happening in his mind. Then, the room will change according to the results of the user's mind.
