So I told her that she would probably like Linkin Park. Then she asked what kind of music they played. I said that they played a mix of rock and rap. So she automatically said she wouldn't like them because she thinks rap sucks.  I changed the subject because I knew I would destroy her if we talked about that any longer. But I'm not gonna let that crap stay stuck in my mind anymore. What a load of hypocratic bs is that? first off, how can you judge something you haven't even heard? And second, If you like real, emotional music, how can you not like rap? They express themselves way more than a lot of other people. So once again, I'm left to bag on my friends because of my taste in music, my strong opinions,and their inability to listen.                                                      Ps: i know I ofteh talk about Linkin Park, but they say whats true and I like it.
