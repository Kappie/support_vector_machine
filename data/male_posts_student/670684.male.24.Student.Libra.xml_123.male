Man, I sure do feel safe going to bed at night knowing that George Bush is the guy with his finger on the button.  He knows that we're fighting people who hate freedom.  It shows that there are some people that are just bad people.  And suprisingly, most of them seem to look and sound very little like us fat cats in the good ol' US of A.  Don't I look like the cat's pajamas!
