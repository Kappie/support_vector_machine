Good ripples all around. And definitely no weird scary koala bears in hats. Also, everyone, go see Big Fish. It is officially out now, and I saw a preview of it and it is such an awesome movie. It made me cry and laugh and everything. It's a brilliant film. Jonah, I want The Once and Future King back. Also The Da Vinci Code from Levi. You guys have had those for like six months. I've decided that I'm fixing the fanfiction recommendation of the week on Saturday, so here it is. You might not care, but I do. Another Lifetime by Kazzy, again for SW, again on fanfiction.net. I do read other fandoms and other sites, but these have just updated more. It's an AU where Padme doesn't die and is raising the twins, hopping from one planet to another and staying one step ahead of the Empire. Some very cute stories.  I shall now push "post and publish."  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.
