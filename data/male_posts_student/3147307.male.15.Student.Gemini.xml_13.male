(actually, it was kinda refreshing) I also wrote a poem during school (although it should've been HW) and had to do a calligraphy poster with the poem in art class. How stupid is this: A poem is a set of words It can be quite absurd It might make no sense It could be scary and tense And many times A poem rhymes And tells a story  A poem can tell about the past Or it could talk of breakfast Anything the writer wants Can be written down at once And many times A poem rhymes And tells a story
