What a relief it is to have our Executive looking out for us. Who knows what horrible things could take place if, say, John and Don wanted to spend their lives together as a married couple. Oh, but wait! John and Don have already been living together for years. Surely by now the awful things that are supposed to happen when men marry men have already happened.  Perhaps it is because of John and Don that heterosexual marriages (the "right" kind, remember)  urlLink fail  40% of the time. Traditional marriage is a sacred institution and that is why for centuries it has been God's plan that Elvis can hitch up John and Sally forever or "until we sober up." Seems to me that marriage isn't particularly sacred in this country until someone comes along to ask if maybe we could change it.  Me? I'm a married straight guy; been married to the same gal for over eighteen years. We were married in a church and, as far as we're concerned, that's where the deed was done. I say this because, just after the ceremony, my wife and I had to sign a piece of paper issued by the state of Oregon that it was okay for us to be married. Well, good on them! But, basically, my life partner and I would be together anyway, regardless of what the state says.  Of course there are some legal ramifications to our marriage: namely that we have a right of survivorship should one of us die and that, at tax time, we can file our return as a couple. Additionally, my wife could make some decisions about my health care should I become incapacitated because, well, she's my wife. (Unless I'm in a vegetative state and my parents object to me being  urlLink unplugged .) Why is it impossible for same-sex partners to have this same assurance? Why is it such a scourge on our nation to admit that it might be a good thing?  How about we separate marriage from civil union; the church, chapel, temple, synagog, or mosque, would have responsibility for the first and the state (not the Federal government) would oversee the second. Some folks might want to get married and also enter into a legally-binding agreement. Others might want to have a ceremony at Starbucks or Vick's World of Tractors and then run down to city hall for the paperwork. What's the harm? Why can't same-sex couples document the same kind of commitment to unity as do their straight neighbors?  Are we getting hung on up the word "marriage?" Throw it out of state verbiage completely! That's right, you only get married as part of a religious ceremony. The state records your union and/or disunion. Simple.  Oh, and Mr. Bush? You've already made a mockery of our constitution, why go on to mess it up some more?
