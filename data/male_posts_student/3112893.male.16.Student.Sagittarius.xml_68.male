I was always told that C was an ugly language to learn, but I think it's quite possibly the best language I've ever seen. It's so succinct, so tight, so efficient, so beautiful that it inspires me to get in the guts of my computer and make it MY slave. I haven't felt this excited about coding since I first picked up a Java book. Wow.  While, I was doing this, since I had made a plan to rip all the CDs that I hadn't yet, I was doing that in between the little exercises. Doing this reminded me how much music I bought and how much of it I thought was cool and still think is cool years after I bought it, like Bob Dylan and The Police.  So, yeah, I also talked to a few people over AIM while doing these other things and it was fun :-). I ate like 6 of those "Chewy" brand Quaker granola bars that are loaded with sugar and the like. They're surprisingly addictive, despite the canker-sore that I've developed that gets irritated more and more with every bite. I feel really dumb eating them, but man, they're just so tasty and right next to the computer. Don't blame me, dammit!  Moving on, after most of my nice day had passed, it was about 7:10 when I found out that my dad and Ali were gonna have another meeting, so naturally I tagged along and listened. Business meetings are fun to listen to, in my opinion anyway. We at this mexican place in Harvard Square called Border Cafe. It's pretty good. After dinner, we walked around and got some tea from another place in Harvard Square called Tealuxe. It's a great place with an amazingly large selection of tea and a great aroma. It's also got a free wireless connection for customers, which is cool because you could do almost anything with a good laptop and the internet :-). Ali and I didn't get anything, but my dad got a cup of the tea of the day.  So, after my dad got his tea, we hung around outside the door and talked about stuff and the conversation evolved into one of my future. I really like these talks because they give me a little kick and a reason to wake up in the morning. Anyway, I now know what I need to do, not that I didn't before, but it helped to hear it all again to get into a good college. I know, I keep flip-flopping around, but I think that I should take advantage of the cerebral frontal cortex that god's given me and besides, being an engineer doesn't mean I can't be a guitarist and be in a band too. It just means that I'll be one busy motherfucker. Anyway, often during these discussions I phase out and think about what I want to because I've heard most of it already, so when it starts to get uninteresting, I tune out, nod regularly and mutter uh huh's every now and again for a short while as I squeeze in my own thought. Getting back on track, during this time, I remembered that over the course of one of these similar talks, telling my dad and Chris (a.k.a. Scooby) that "I don't do plans" when they suggested I draw out a strategy, and both of them just essentially walking off and calling me stupid for thinking that. I just thought that was kinda funny how I was so dumb back then and how I've kind of matured a bit. I need to make a plan for the next year of my life to get into MIT and just get the entry process done and over with. Thanks, ol' Pops and Ali for the help, not that either of you read this, but whatever.  Oh, right, I almost forgot about the old posts that I was gonna throw in to these daily ones. I've decided that I'll just do my best to figure out what was written when and just stick in two a day. Anyway, these're the next two posts I wrote:  January 27th of 2004  The Ever-Growing, Ever-Irritating Growths  The Gory Detail of My Toenails  I clipped my toenails today after waiting for over two months and I accidentally cut a little, tiny, incy-wincy bit of my big toe off with the clippers and it bled forever. I also had a lot to clean up when I was done. Well, ya know what they say, "People in glass houses sink ships". Naw, but seriously, "St. Peter loves and has never turned down a well-groomed, short-toenailed businessman."         >> meowMix  January 28th of 2004  It was cloudy  Feelin' lonely and lazy  Today was a cloudy day and I've been lonely. I haven't left the house consistently for over a week and it's been getting to me. I sit at home and play SC, sometimes do some math, or pick up an old Political Science book, or on some days like today, fixing an iPod. I don't know what has been up lately. I just seem to have lost all motivation to do anything other than eat and laze around the house, but what's odd is that I don't really like doing that.  Perhaps what's causing this is my moving to the massive city that is LA. When I lived back in Boston I could just take a bus and a train and my two legs to anywhere I wanted, but in LA, while I may be able to take a bus or 4 to nearly anywhere I would WANT to go, it's not pleasant to walk from bus-stop to bus-stop, nor am I particularly fond of the looks I get when riding on the busses around here. Another thing may be that there's not much to do in this city without 40 bucks in your pocket... and I don't have 40 bucks. In Boston I still didn't have 40 bucks lying around but there was almost always a bookstore within a mile or two from where you were standing, and since the place is filled with students, there is always a pleasant place to eat for under 5 bucks. Perhaps it's just what I see when I walk around... Everyone drives a $45k car and wears fancy clothes, but doesn't care in the slightest about what's happening outside their circle of friends.  Aw hell, maybe I'm all wrong about why I'm not going outside but I don't know what's up with me and I don't like it. This place doesn't feel like home and I'm not sure how long it will take before it will :-\.         >>meowMix  Well, I'm not even gonna bother explaining these things. You can figure it out yourself for the most part I think. I'm kinda tired from today anyway.  That is all. -- Feanor
