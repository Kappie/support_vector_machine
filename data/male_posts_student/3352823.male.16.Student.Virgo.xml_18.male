The only thing that I have to concentrate on now is studying... Boo for Biology. I will start tonight with a bit of luck. But I've been shot in the foot! OUCH! 'Cause I was leant the first two seasons of Alias on DVD (nyah Rose) so I wanna watch it soooooo bad. I will be free on Friday June 18th 2004. The saviour day. I cannot wait 'till that day. It cannot come soon enough.  Tick. Tick. Tick...  Still not here...  I'm gonna wait else where.   Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick...
