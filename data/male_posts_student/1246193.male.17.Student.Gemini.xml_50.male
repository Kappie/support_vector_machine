Wednesday night a couple of guys who weren't members came into the club and wanted to play.  I told them that it wasn't anything personal but because they weren't members they couldn't play.  Five minutes later I had taken their money and they were teeing off.  All I did for the rest of the night was worry about it. I think some of the members were a little pissed off because I noticed that they were backing up play on the course.  Tonight a couple of people came in and I told them how much it would be.  They told me that I was wrong and that there was a special going on.  I charged them what they told me to, even though Jeff, my boss, never said anything about reduced prices.  I don't deal well with pressure and I am worried that if it ever comes to anything serious I am not going to be able to stand up for myself.  I need to do something.  I don't know what.  Just blogging has made me feel better.  On a brighter note, I am miserable with the homework and wouldn't mind killing myself. Morgan was bothered by my extensive knowledge about painless ways to kill yourself but it is just some of my trivial knowledge, always important for scholastic bowl!  I don't want to die a painfull death.    If it was your choice would you live for 90 years with perfect health and then die an extremely painful death  or  would you choose to live for only 65 years and die painlessly?
