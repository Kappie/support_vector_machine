Before the pilot was broadcast, the role was re-cast with Annette O'Toole and her scenes were edited into the existing footage. A sequence showing Lex Luthor as Preasident of the United States was filmed on the set of   urlLink  "West Wing, The" (1999)   .     Annette O'Toole, who plays Mrs. Kent, also appeared in   urlLink  Superman III (1983)    as Lana Lang.     The pilot episode shows Chloe handing Pete Ross a wad of cash. Most likely an in-joke from the Canadian production crew, if you look carefully, you can see a Canadian $5 bill sticking out of it.     At the beginning of the episode "Nicodemus", Jonathan Kent is listening to the theme song from   urlLink  "Dukes of Hazzard, The" (1979)   . John Schneider, who plays Mr. Kent, also played Bo Duke.     In the episode "Delete", Clark's parents' email address is CNH320@instamail.org. CHN 320 was the license plate on the General Lee on "The Dukes of Hazzard".     Clark consistently wears red and/or blue clothing, the same livery he will eventually wear as Superman.     Contains frequent in-joke references to the Superman mythos in various episodes.     The climax of first season episode "Stray" (episode #16) was shot on location in a bowling alley in Richmond, BC, Canada. Coincidentally, the bowling alley in question is named "Lois Lanes", also the name of Clark Kent's future love interest.     Chloe and Whitney were created specifically for the show (they were never mentioned in the Superman comics). However, in 2003, DC Comics announced that Chloe would be introduced into the Superman comics.     The episode "Redux" was filmed after the first season finale, "Tempest", but aired later in season two. Some lines were dubbed in indicating its placement later in season two (such as Lana discussing Clark's secretiveness and Martha working for Lionel Luthor) though those episodes had yet to be filmed.     Chloe sometimes mentions her college-age cousin who is also interested in journalism; more recent episodes have seen Chloe identify this cousin as Lois Lane.     urlLink  Remy Zero   , who performs the theme song "Save Me" make a cameo appearance as the band playing at Smallville High's spring formal, lip-synching the hit song in episode #21: "Tempest".     In the pilot a newspaper is shown with a headline about "Queen Industries" which in the D.C. Comics is owned by Oliver Queen, a.k.a. the Green Arrow.     Based on DC Comics characters.     In the pilot episode, the "villain" is loosely based on the DC Comics villain Conduit.     In the episode "Zero", there are references to Central City and Bludhaven which are home to DC Comics super heroes The Flash and Nightwing respectively.     In the episode, "Redux" there is a reference made to Coast City which was the one-time home of DC Comics super-hero Green Lantern.     In the episode, "Ryan" there is a reference to Hub City which is the home of DC Comics super hero The Question.     In the episode "Metamorphis" Jonathan tells Clark that he "was meant for much greater things then winning football games". Jonathan says the same thing to Clark in   urlLink  Superman (1978)   . In an incredible coincidence, the episode "Perry", which dealt with a large solar flare affecting Clark's powers, first aired in the US on the same day that the largest solar flair in over 100 years struck the Earth, 29 October 2003.     All episodes have one-word titles.     To coincide with the release of the CD "In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003" on 28 October 2003, the third season episode "Slumber" included only songs by   urlLink  R.E.M.   . The album is released on Warner Brothers, the same company that produces this show.     The sound effect used for the sound of Kryptonite radiating is the same as the one used in   urlLink  "Lois  Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" (1993)   .     In the episode "Asylum", there is a newspaper headline about the Themisciran Queen, a reference to Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta.     In the episode "Rosetta" the musical score for Dr. Virgil Swann is "The Fortress of Solitude" and "Main Theme" from Superman (1978), originally composed by John Williams.     Lex Luther's mansion is the same mansion used in   urlLink  X-Men (2000)      According to Martha, Clark's first word was "Lara", the name of his Kryptonian Biological mother as revealed in "Memoria".     There are numerous references to a m  ental asylum called Belle Reve. In the DC Comics' stories, Belle Reve was the name for a high security prison for supervillains which was also secretly the headquarters for a covert operations unit that used cooperative inmates nicknamed The Suicide Squad.     In "Drone" it is revealed that Sasha got her ability to control Bees after falling in Shuster Gorge. Joe Shuster along with Jerry Siegal created Superman.     At the charity party the end of "Fever" Pete hands Clark a CD and tells him it's the Talon mix. If you look closely you'll see that it is actually the soundtrack to the series.     In "Ryan", Lex shows Ryan his "Warrior Angel" Collection. The cover to "Fantasy Comics-Warrior Angel" #1 is a nod to the cover of DC's "Action Comics" #1 in which Superman made his first appearance.     In "Rosetta",   urlLink  Christopher Reeve   's character's name, "Dr. Swann", is a reference to the Superman artist of the '70s and '80s, Curt Swann.     In "Rosetta", the scenes with Dr. Swann were shot on the set of   urlLink  "Third Watch" (1999)   .
