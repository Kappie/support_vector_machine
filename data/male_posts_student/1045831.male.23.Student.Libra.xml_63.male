I honestly think some kids just don't know when they are being douchebags but I have reached my limit and I am done with that bullshit.   But now on to some more interesting fun type stuff...  Last night me and a couple guys were out grabbing some food and we met this guy who was teaching at Bill Self's KU Basketball Camp and he was looking for a place to go drinking.  I started to give him directions to the bull and the I decided what the fuck just come home with us we got beer...  Got to drinking and then we went out with some guys from the house to The Bull and then The Wheel.  At the Wheel these old guys were buying us beer and telling us all these crazy stories, It was funny.  Then Anne showed up and since Claudia was there craziness ensued.  The wierdest shit was Anne saying she could Black Mail me with something but then not telling me what.  But she said she wouldn't cuz she was nice.  It was wierd shit going down at the old Wheel.  But you know what they say...  "When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro."
