Maybe i will be doing other stuff like fixing computers. Hell i dont know where i will be yet. My dad always asks me what i wanna be and i say i dont know bcause im so shy to everyone not to talk, but i really wanna start a band even if we dont go far. i was inspired by music by my dad when i was little, but didnt take much into consideration till 7th grade. i played string bass in band, but no one could hear me or care. kyle stembaugh also played and he couldnt read music hahahah. He always asked me to tab it out for him and i told him to go learn sheet music and he didnt really answer me when i tol him to.  Today huh well went to Steve Blairs B-day and went around and around. His parents to wal-mart to change there lube then we headed to the golden corral to eat, but they changed their mind because it was seafood and steak so we walked all the way to Dos Machos. that was a good place they give you tortillas and dip as a apetizer. as we were eating were talking about movies and crap. one of the waitress asked if it was somones birthday and she would bring the mexican band to sing happy birthday but were so unpatient we left and steves mom said that they brought some icecream but oh well. then we went to toys R us then to big bear then we went to the movie gallery to rent video games for the xbox we rented red dead revolver and mortal combat deadly alliance.    THE GAMES SUCK.       but we played halo   . me and steve jammed out on guitars. his parents limit him 3 hrs a day well that sucks. they should let him play a lot, hell you never know that he might become a guitar legend and i might be at his side...or not.     then travis controller for xbox was going wacko the left trigger didnt work. steves mom insisted she wanted to buy travis a new controller and he said no , and she insisted yes. blah blah blah blah more or more yes and no from each of them. then they dropped me off. i ate a cheeseburger and fried my mom made, shes a good mom. watched the phantom mennace for a little bit probaly 3/4 of it. then played guitar now im here bored as hell im only doing this blog so i can reflect in some years what i did and hope i want to do  bye for now
