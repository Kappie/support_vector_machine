They had no periods left so they weren't missing out on any thing. All they did was get drunk at school. Ok it sounds bad but lets break it down. They didnt have anything important to do, i don't think they hurt anyone (other than, possibly, themselves). MY brother's friends have done worse more often. They think it's terrible that she is drunk at school, which hurts no one, yet they think its funny that they steal countless things from school, break countless things at school. I am envious of them, I have never been all that good at breaking rules but erin does it all the time, and that is one of the reasons why she is so fun, because she is willing to do stuff. Finally what is the worst thing that could come of this a yell and a slap on the wrist, nothing terrible. I knwo i am just repeating myself again and again, and I apologise im just trying to think of the best way to explain it.   1 Up Shroom Ezza and George for doing something that i have always wanted to do  Poisoned Shroom Hypocrisy
