Our two families get along so well, and we seem to like the same things.  So, they're gonna be here a few days, and were going to go out to eat on Friday all together with even more family.  It's always fun when we get together and go out together, so I'm looking forward to that.  I'm crossing my fingers that I will be seeing Dodgeball tomorrow.  This will be like the first movie like that that I have seen in a very long time.  My parents don't like that kind of movie, and I always go to the movies with them, so I never see half the movies I want to.  But this time I have other people to go with, and if Mike can get some money ill finally get to see the movie.  later...
