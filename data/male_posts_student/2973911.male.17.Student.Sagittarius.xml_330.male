I think Jed agrees with the great catch thing.  I know you like me Jed, don't hide it.  Do I feel cautious?  Yes.  Do I feel a relationship is necessary?  Less so.  Do I find myself thinking about wimmenz?  Yes.  Am I sleepless?  No.  Narcoleptic?  Yes.  Do I think I want a relationship, of any type?  No.  I don't.  Newton died a virgin.  I don't wanna die having an anarch childe outside my jurisdiction.  If I fail in relationships, married, casual or otherwise, I don't think I would die willingly.  Wait, wattamaysaying?  What I want to imply is whether any relationship, test/analysis I enter would be worth it even if I don't take it seriously (not saying laughing my heart out at her expense).  I mean if it would be worth if I don't pursue further and if anyone would morally accept it as such later.  Well?
