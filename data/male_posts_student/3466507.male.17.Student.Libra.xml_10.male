Unfortunately, I thought it was ast Sunday(isn't it supposed to be the second Sunday of every June?) and SMSed m dad last Sunday. I did it again today too. He sounded pleased in his reply.  I read a Preteen comic strip today. It was very funny. The girls said that they thought it over that Father's Day was too commercialised so they decided to just give them respect according to one of the ten commandments. So one of them knocks a small gong, together they say "We honour you" and then back away. That was hilarious, especially when after they left the parents look at each other and say,"Man, our kids are cheap." Hoot!  Anyway, this is just to wish all fathers a Happy Father's Day. I know it is no easy job being a good father. To fathers who smoke, do quit smoking for the sake of your family. To those who feel that they aren't spending enough time with their family, chances are that ou aren't. It's just a choice and depends on your priority whether work is more important or time with your children. Just remember that your children won't always be there to play with you nor will theywait for you to grow up. They will be growing up constantly, as in the song "Sunrise, Sunset".
