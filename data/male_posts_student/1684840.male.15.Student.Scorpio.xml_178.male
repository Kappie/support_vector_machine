Well actually, English was better.  We did yet another brilliant Duffy poem called 'Educating for Leisure' (I took an extract and put it as today's blog title) which was brilliant.  Read:   Education for Leisure    Today I am going to kill something.  Anything. I have had enough of being ignored and today I am going to play God. It is an ordinary day, a sort of grey with boredom stirring in the streets.  I squash a fly against the window with my thumb. We did that at school. Shakespeare. It was in another language and now the fly is in another language. I breathe out talent on the glass to write my name.  I am a genius. I could be anything at all, with half the chance. But today I am going to change the world. Something's world. The cat avoids me. The cat knows I am a genius, and has hidden itself.  I pour the goldfish down the bog. I pull the chain. I see that it is good. The budgie is panicking. Once a fortnight, I walk the two miles into town for signing on. They don't appreciate my autograph.  There is nothing left to kill. I dial the radio and tell the man he's talking to a superstar. He cuts me off. I get our bread-knife and go out. The pavements glitter suddenly. I touch your arm.    Carol Ann Duffy   Scary poem don't you think?  I took the following line and put it as my MSN Name because I think, well, I think it is cool (and sounds like something Chris would say lol):  "The cat avoids me. The cat knows I am a genius, and has hidden itself..."  Anyway, at the end of school we discussed my leaving party and have decided to have a cool Teen night out.  To start off with we shall eat pizza in town park and then go and watch a movie at the cinema.  It's going to be great
