(If you're a student) I would like to put down some of the funny lines, but I think that would spoil the movie. All the times I've seen it have been after 9:00....pm. So that means I keep getting home rather late. That's ok however, because I've developed a tendency to sleep in whenever a situation like that occurs. So, I'm alright. Not that it is a special tendency, but it helps. Now I'm hungry. So if you have any spare time and money send me a giant calzone or something like that....and some pie too. That'd be really nice. Probably going to bike in the rain. Interesting feeling that, but you should try it.
