Angel, on the other hand, tried to eat my face last night. [of course, knowing you two, Ashley probably did, too-Marten]    Michael:  Could you please define 'musical' for us.  It's a thin line sometimes.  I mean,there's movies with singing that aren't really musicals, but some people call them musicals.  And common musicals that are  technically  opera.  So I need to know exactly what you consider to be a musical before I choose a movie.  In other news, the lack of votes in the democratic primary resulted in a tie between Daniel and The Duckman, and the Duckman won that pong match.  Daniel, however is his running mate.  Palpatine has chosen Christopher Lee as his running mate.  Sharpton is running as an independant.  Now for the incredibly politically absurd and cheesy 'green party' election.  Nominees are: Kermit the Frog Yoda Larry the Cucumber The Wicked Witch of the West Ralph Nader (wearing green paint) SO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
