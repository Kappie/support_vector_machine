Postcard anyone?      urlLink    The obligatory touristy shot. ...this one was not my idea.      urlLink    The colored lights of Cairo nights: on a boat on the Nile, passing another boat with similar fluorescent-rainbow lighting.      urlLink    First photo of Alexandria! What a relief it was to visit this breezy coastal city, especially as it was right at sundown on the only day I observed the fast of Ramadan.      urlLink    Top Gym. For bigger bodies and smaller craniums. At an Alexandria near you.      urlLink    The view from the balcony (yes, Balcony!) in our Alexandria Hotel. Our room, if I remember correctly, cost roughly 30 EGP/ night. This translates into Â£3.00, and it was the best hired accomodation of the trip.      urlLink    Too cool for Cairo.      urlLink    Ah, the Cecil! Home of many a mirror-world meeting.      urlLink    The mirror in which Darley met Justine...      urlLink    The Temple of Luxor. (This is funny because "Luxor" comes from the Arabic "Al-Uqsar," meaning "The Palaces." The Temple of Luxor, then, nonsensically means "The Temple of Palaces.")      urlLink    More of the Temple of Luxor.      urlLink    The Temple of Hatshepsut in the Valley of the Queens across the river from Luxor.      urlLink    Hieroglyphs in Hatshepsut's temple.      urlLink    Stark scenery of the Temple of Hatshepsut     urlLink    Competition was fierce at this year's contest...      urlLink    Peakaboo: I see Hatshepsut-Hathor!      urlLink    Amazingly preserved hierogylphics--check out the color!      urlLink    The Colossi of Memnon outside the Valley of the Kings near Luxor.      urlLink    The afternoon sun over the Nile from a posh hotel in Luxor.      urlLink    Nothing compares to the sight of the sun setting slowly over the Nile, a felucca darting in and out of the flame, while drinking Chai 'Annan (Mint Tea) after an exhausting day. Nothing.      urlLink    On the last trip of the trip: a first-class sleeper journey from Luxor to Cairo. Theoretically two days from home, but realistically miles from anywhere... urlLink
