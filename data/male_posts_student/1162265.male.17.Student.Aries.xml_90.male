Although I still felt strange, so after dinner, I started delving deep into the Occult and I'm probubly gonna mingle with that Magic crap until I realize it's all a joke.  It's slightly disturbing how many people play around with that type of stuff though..... Whatever that's just my confusion speaking out.
