I'll be sitting here on the 14th of June thinking "God damn, if only this were the 9th of March". I'm going to have another day like this and think back and say "You know, I haven't had a day like this since... March 9th!"  Slept well. Got to work, no cycle count. Jeff came back today. We go breakfast. He bought an Xbox. I bought Freelancer. I had dinner with my parents - Chinese - At the China House (next year they're moving to Kitchener and renaming it China Haus) - had the Hibatchi dish (the PuPu Platter - It won the Chinkie(tm) award for the stupidest name of a Chinese dish ever) - My fortune was hilarious ("You love Chinese Food") and we had a good solid talk about what I'm going to do for living accomodations for the next little while.  God damn, it was a good day.
