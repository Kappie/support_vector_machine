The first act confused me and induced me to fall asleep twenty separate, individually excruciating times. When it ended, I was sure the wretched thing would be done with, but no. There was still Act 2. It was also bad and I fell asleep for most of it.  The acting wasn't horrible; the play itself was. It just... sucked. There is no other word to describe the torturous two hours or so (I really have no idea) of my life that that wasted, excluding obscene words, which I do not use in print out of habit.
