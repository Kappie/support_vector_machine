      So, here I am, lazy bastard extraordinaire, posting again. The easter weekend was a lazy extravaganza, but if I was religious then I'd say Jesus spent most of easter weekend being lazy. Really lazy. I mean dead. Anyway, I saw Spartan, David Mamet's new film (one of the joys of living in a college town is that I don't have to drive 45 minutes to see new movies). It was really damn good. Sucker can write some scripts. Nick, I hope you like eternal sunshine. It is also damn good. Charlie Kaufman can write him some scripts too. I learned a valuable lesson about drinking on Saturday, which I've learned before, and that is don't drink too much because it sucks. The party I left (which only turned into a party as all of our friends progressively showed up troughout the night) was eventually busted up by the police, I guess, which is bizarre because none of my friends are really the busted by the police types. Nobody went to jail, which I guess is all you can ask for when it comes down to it.   So, in the spirit of this boring boring post, I am going to tell a story about my dream woman, whom I saw on campus the other day. This supercool black chick dressed as a skater and wearing an "I Love Nerds" shirt walked by (too hot in my opinion. I guess that makes me a racist. My bad), talking to her friend about this psycho guy who kept calling her. "He won't leave me alone. He's psycho," she said. Her friend left, and then this other black guy out of nowhere just comes up and tries hitting on her. He goes "This guy won't leave you alone? Let's see what I can do about that. I'm James," (I'm guessing the name.  I can't remember.) She kind of looks at him incredulously and goes "I'm Suzie." (again, the name is a guess). So she starts walking and he is following her and he just starts talking crap like "Oh, I'll take care of this guy. What do you want me to do to him?" and she just says "Stop following me!" The guy stops, obviously shocked that his smoove-mo-b routine didn't pan out and yells "I ain't following you! You're psycho!" So she turns around, super-cool and says "I am psycho. I'm not afraid to admit it!" Then she walked out of my life. Oh man! I've never seen anybody shot down like that. But what I want to know is what the hell this guy was thinking. I mean, did he think to himself "Oh, I'll show this poor timid girl I can kick dudes' asses. Then she'll be mine." Give me a break. This isn't 1954, hoss. I bet she would have kicked both of their asses in a fight. And to end with a quote:  "I love you dream woman!" - Garth in Wayne's World
