Secondly, if you all email me your email adresses, I can send you an invitation to become members of this blog. However, that is only for you own amusement, you can still just post your stuff at WebCT and I will copy it over to our blog.  If you have any questions, just let me know.  Yours truly, Carl :-)  urlLink jonaswallentin@yahoo.com
