ONE QUESTION!! thats preventing me from finishing the damn tutorial.. yet this one question vexes me so.. some of u tink that its just homework.. well.. it may be 2 u.. but then.. i take maths quite seriously.. the only time i never take maths seriously is when:    1. i have to do/draw graphs (whether sketching or on graph paper)   2. i am damn tired   3. i am expecting someone 2 call or msg me or sms me   4. i yearn 4 the comp   5. i am experiencing any form of holiday (be it xmas or sch hols)    >sidethought    [ in the whole textbook/syllabus of maths.. whether A or O.. the part involving graphs is the most IRRITATING, DISTRESSING, ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING part of maths that i have ever encountered in my whole WIDE LIFE!! i tend to avoid it like the plague.. heck.. i tink i have a phobia of it.. they call this Graphobia.. ]     aniwaes.. this is my way of destressing other than trashing the comp (the game AI that is) n watching a gd dose of TV..     >sidethought    [ its past 10.30 alreadi.. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is alreadi over.. crap.. ]     stupid maths.. the ting i hate bout maths (actualli myself) is that i take so damn long juz to realise/find the damn mistake..    >sidethought    [ hell.. even after i turn on my "search and destroy" strategy.. the most minor of details slip my eye/mind.. it like the maths question is a telepathic sentient being clouding my mind with misinformation and assumptions.. or it could be my mind that has been bogged down wif fatigue.. ]     either way.. it would alwaes seem that after like say.. a half-hour break/2-8 hour nap.. my mind would wake up.. and my mind would perform a reboot and then everyting would be as clear as crystal and i would spot the mistake..    > sidethought     [ actualli fogged up crystal.. if i juz woke up.. everyting would just seem a little hazy.. sometimes turns black though.. ]     apparently.. my mind actualli takes the time wen im asleep to do repairs.. unfortunately this never happens when:    1. im on holiday   2. the exam is tomorrow    poor me.. damn.. =(    but then.. maths holds its "nice" side.. according to me that is.. well.. my opinion is that maths is enjoyable only when you:    1. know how 2 or eventually solve every question   2. have gd (best is pro) friends that are doing maths with you   3. have your discman/comp playing music for u    coupled with a nice environment.. aka someplace that is not at home or at a fast food outlet.. maths can be rather enjoyable.. there is the satisfaction (or at least i feel it.. heh..) when u finalli solve that problem..     >sidethought    [ especially after i finish a question after 20-60mins of pondering.. the solution beams through like the light at the end of the pitch black tunnel.. then u slide out of the tunnel into the pit of fire that was producing the light..  ^^  ]     still.. maths can be either enjoyable or hateful.. i personally enjoy it.. cept graphs.. (remember graphobia..) it also depends on the pple whu yur doing maths with.. if its with yurself.. it may seem rather boring.. sides if u dunno a ques.. whu u gonna refer 2?? yurself? if u do it with a close friend.. chances are that yur maths are gonna get better.. if yur doing maths with a close AND pro friend.. u hit the jackpot.. lets just say that as long as 2 pple cooperate 2gether.. its a win-win situation and both wins.. well.. thats wat i tink aniwae..    slppy alreadi.. haiz.. stress relief indeed.. kinda glad i actualli started this log.. oh crap.. its 11..
