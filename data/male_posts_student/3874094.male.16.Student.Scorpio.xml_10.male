Now lemme see wat happened on friday...uh...had classes as usual...was nodding away AS usual..haha. Decided to skip the ICT variety show together with samuel and sookjai, all of us happily decided that the show was a complete waste of time and that we could be at home doing somethin more productive like erm...sharpening our c generals skills.... ;P   And today? well, original plan was to go for the morning harmonica session so that i could take my testimonial from mdm peng but surprise surprise, found out that mdm peng would only be around for the afternoon session...oh well, my beauty sleep disrupted for nothing...lol. Lied to the nice SBS uncle that i was a still a secondary student so that i could pay only 60 cents in cash WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Er, violin went ok as usual, just shocked at the sudden change of tone, should not depend too much on the violin mute thing, makes my already pathetic tone recognition skills a lot more worse...screwed up on my first try at Allegro. Saw the original book which contained Dvorak's piano and violin pieces..goodness, the cover looks so nice, yet the pieces look so bloody cheem..haha  Rushed down to harmonica after violin in hopes of catchin mdm peng but OH man, my dear mdm peng did not do it...oh well, can't blame her anyway, she was really busy this week and she did seem sincerly apologetic about it, but hey, no worries there mdm peng! Gives me more time to write the Intent letter thing...not like i really wanna do it anyway...hahahaha.   Er bascially thats the whole two days ridicously compressed into 2 teeny weeny paragraphs...night still young, shehui and george slamming each other online on msn AS usual...so yea, thats all i guess, later people.
