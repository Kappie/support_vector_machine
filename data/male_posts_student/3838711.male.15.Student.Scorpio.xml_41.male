Went to school empty handed today. With my 6230 in my pocket. Haha. Teachers dont check on special occasions, so I knew it was a safe bet to bring it along. Met Zheng Long at the bus stop (on several occasions liao) and had a little chat with him. Kinda surprised when I saw him in his basketball jersey, not the usual school uni.  School started off with a parade of the flag being brought in, and after that it was a lame session of sitting in the hall, watching some dumb marbles roll down the tracks. And some cardboards trying to float with weights on them... Such a waste of time. Back to class, had a National Day Brainiest Day Marist quiz, and we got in second. Damn Mario, answering all the questions so fast... haha. Couldnt get a chance to answer :(  Unexpectedly, I went bowling with Joshua, Champ, Hai Kiat, Benjamin, Mark and Evan. Daryl and Wei Kwong came later. 3 sets, and I headed home to bath, for my dosage of WMMT at Century Square.... Darn, waited 1 whole hour for the seat, and guess what, after a few games a headache developed.... Had to stop after losing to the R200 club (changed to 3 ghosts driving Namco Toyota Corollas, not BCNR-33's..) three damn times in a row... Too painful to drive with full concentration..... Met Stewart there playing ID too, didnt talk much, before I had my lunch at Yoshinoya.... at 5 pm ! Did not take breakfast... so this was considered my first meal of the day ? Haha.  Headed home by bus 72, nearly missed the stop to change to 53... headache made me somewhat dizzy and sleepy then... But now its gone since 7 pm, and I'm fine now.  Am kinda looking forward to tomorrow, where it will be another massive PN meeting at CTP Mac. Gonna discuss how that egoistic retard is gonna be dealt, and to see whether he will apologise or not. Man... what could be worse than friendly fire... And then trying to act nice to see if u're ok or not... Hypocrite. Get a life u moronic loser. Things dont always go as you plan all the time. And lastly, the world doesnt revolve around you, so scrap that idea of yours.  Thats about it for today, feeling kinda ok, but somewhat lonely... Since I didnt have any company to go to Tampines with... so, maybe the feeling kicked in ? I dont know... seeing so many couples during the time in Tampines... and me being a lonely soul...  Bleah... Cant help but feel this way... Life just doesnt treat me good enough.  Umm... Gotta go catch some sleep soon, meeting the seller for the 6100 tomorrow, gonna flash my firmware of the 6230 with him.... haha.. Nokia power ! *woot*  Benedict signing out ! =)
