She had not known that he wanted to do the same.  At night, she awakes to his screams for help. He, however, did not scream for help. Had she seen him do it? Or was it a coincidental dream. She often wondered if she was in that place between asleep and awake, that place where she could still remember dreaming, and yet wonder if she is still alive. That is where he said he would always love her. Right there.  Wax dripped down onto her wrist from the monatery white candle sitting in her hand. The burning meant nothing. She had burnt him with wax plenty of times, and it really didn't seem to phase him. Why should it do the same to her?  A scream out on the moor. No, not there, nowhere. No, inside. No, behind you, screaming, and there he stood, in the blink of an eye, wailing, not screaming, and in just that instant, dissapeared like a grain of sand.  He had always told her that dreams were often easier to remember than reality. This was also the case with lies, which were harder to believe than truth. That is how he would tell the difference. She had remembered that image so vividly. Could he have been right? He was always right about a lot of things.  She had left her bedroom window open. The twilight-driven winds whipped at her hair. Hundreds of nights they had lyed awake, being caressed by this very same wind. Perhaps it knew the truth. "Why not ask the winds," he would say, as if to rhetort "who knows?"  You do not truly know what you have until you have lost it. Another scream. Always screaming. She, herself, would soon befal the same madness at this horrible shreaking. But alas, it was not a scream, simply the tides crashing against the rocks, whispering tales of the sea told eons ago. Did anybody really understand what the Earth was saying? He had left her with only questions unanswered.  And there he was again. Opening the door to the porch, its rusty hinges creaking, as the winds goaded him along. There he was again, strolling, undaunted towards the surf. There the ocean was, a sweltering pearlescent madness of its own, still ripe with the haunting sunset. She had watched that sunset with him, and it would last forever. There he was, and he walked out into it. Not to swim, not to float, not to sink, not to die. To walk. And he walked, out into the abyss. Had she watched him in horror? Or had she slept the night away at his conspicuousness?  Naught but his body had washed ashore. He had left her with bits of clothing, jewellery, and unanswered questions. All but his body. He had flat out left her. He left a tear in the ocean once, and when they found it, he would stop loving her. In that salty brine, she alone had discovered that tear. For the dying sea. Would she follow him? Dead like me.
