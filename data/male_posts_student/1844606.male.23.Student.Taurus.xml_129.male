Good news-turns out the jackasses downstairs are on the subleting list for next semester, which should translate into them not being here.  Thing is I had to go to the Tenant Union to figure this out indirectly through the lady calling my landlord...Again more things wasting my time. I saw a Bears game yesterday from "Club Level" seating which roughly translates into some corporation spending $285 per seat so you can park below the stadium and not have to bother with the rabble.  Seats and game were pretty sweet.  I also like the fact that seating is based on classes, cubs on the east, sox fans on the west.  And I don't think its just coinsidence that the skyboxes (cubs) are on the East side, or in view of the cameras.  The pitch of the West side is just about, if not more steep than Comiskey.  More evidence for the whole sox fans thing.  I'm sick, and Halls, tylanol and decongestents aren't doing much.  I really want to sleep.  But I've got work to do.  Got my last story of the year back.  Still no praise, only thing close to it was something about the story being ambitious...asshole.  If we get to fill out forms on this guy, I'm signing it with semen.
