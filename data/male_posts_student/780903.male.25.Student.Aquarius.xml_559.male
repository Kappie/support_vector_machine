If you read the post before, and were really interested but hadn't e-mailed yet, and you were coming back to find it and were going to e-mail me about it, I won't delete your e-mail or anything like that, so feel free to go ahead. I did get lots of replies, but yours just might knock my socks off and force me to hire you.]
