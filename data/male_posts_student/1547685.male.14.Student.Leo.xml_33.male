Let me tell you that bumper boats at 2:00 in the morning is not fun....especially when its freezing cold outside. So I stayed there for the whole night and did: bumper boats, gocarts, lazer tag, golfing, and arcade games. It was really crowded too but it was fun getting to know everyone in your youth group better...while waiting in line.  This week has been the same. Lots of tests/quizes/hw to do and not that much time to finish them.   PTL- My aunt and uncle were baptized on Sunday Prayer- Please pray for my dads office assistent...she has cancer and has been working for my Dad for 14 years.
