I glanced toward the radio just praying that there might actually be a good song on the radio ( which is nearly impossible with all this rap and pop shit, and  rap is not music). Anyway I turned on the radio only to find that "Stacy's Mom" or whatever the name is playing. I listened to half of it and wanted to drive the car off the highway out of sheer depression because of the level of the pure shit I was listening to. This song sounds almost exactly like some rip off of some Beatles song. I mean this is the kind of shit that kids in 5th grade headbang to. It seems that most the music in the past 4 or 5 years has sucked ultimate ass. Except the last Rage Against the Machine concert in 2000. I mean if you listen to this song, it has a pretty sick concept if you ask me, about some guy who goes out with this chick only to get a look at her mom which is probably some middle aged person? And please, refrain from giving me all this " oh, thats not what its about" shit. I get enough of that crap on my normal internet. One reason or another I vote that this song is just some "one hit wonder" from a band who I have heard nothing of except for this one song thats giving them their 5 minutes of fame.  On another note, I would like anyone who is reading this to please check out my friend Reb's blog at  urlLink      Song of the Day:  "Outshined" by Soundgarden   Soda Fountain Suicide News: None to be posted yet, look for more in a later post I might do today.
