Sadly, when trying to run these programs under Windows XP, your computer will tease you and refuse to run the program. Simply running it in compatibility mode for Windows 95 or 98 often doesn't cut it. In fact, it rarely works at all.  This FREE download from Microsoft will fix 75% of your problems. It's called the Application Compatibility Toolkit. Once installed, it works on it's own, detecting what kind of mode Windows needs to run in to allow the program to work. No more experimenting with settings! This program should have been included in the box for Windows XP. Surprise! It was! Dust off your XP Install CD, and go to \Support\Tools on the CD. However, there is a much newer version of this program available online from the Microsoft Webpage, and it's easier then trying to find your install disk, which is buried under crud in your computer room somewhere. You can get it at this handy link:   urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7fc46855-b8a4-46cd-a236-3159970fde94&DisplayLang=en   I'd suggest turning off antivirus programs when installing the program, as the software makes many changes to numerous Registry entries, and Norton or Mcafee have been prone to misinterpret those changes as malicious script. Never fear, it's Microsoft certified and bears my seal of approval.  This software is perfect for the retro gamer, or for those who have need for using older programs of any sort. There is no excuse not to have this gem installed on your PC. 5 stars!
