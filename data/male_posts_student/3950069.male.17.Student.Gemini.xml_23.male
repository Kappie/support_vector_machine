I think i'm gonna make it short tonight, don't really want to think too much about certain things. Anyway, to "()bserver" its really nice to know someone else's point of view over the issues i've written about. Honestly, I do believe certain aspects of what I wrote were a little biased, but everyone's entitled to their own opinions. There will always be, two sides to a coin.  "Why is it that us humans are the only creatures to this day forth capable of intelligent thought, why is there the supernatural void and many more. Think about it and I'll appreciate your views on this issue."  I'll think about it (:  I don't think I'm devoted to religion, or am I a very religious person. I don't know, I just know that as long as I have someone who is important to me, or something which means a lot to me, I will give all myself to make sure I don't take things for granted.  Rightt, so today was nothing special really, had school from 12-3pm. I was late for C programming, I rushed for it I really did, who'd expect Mr Khor actually overslept when he took a rest in his office, and only came in 20 minutes late -grins- Digital electronics was okay, and I mean OKAY. I've got to brush up on memorizing the type of Logic gates and Logic Equation plus familiarise myself with practical. I'm glad jeremy's my lab partner cuz i don't feel lost around him -winks- Cherios to my Partner and all my friends (: I headed home right after that and its been plain.  I don't have the words with me tonight.     wrote our names across the sky tonight     "Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies. "   -Ralph Waldo Emerson   [!__Take all Myself]
