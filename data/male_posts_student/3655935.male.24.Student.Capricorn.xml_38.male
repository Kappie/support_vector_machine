The first sign I came across looks like this:     I thought this was a bizarre way to welcome someone to Michigan.  My guess is that this slogan must be based on the two most fond memories stated by those polled who were leaving Michigan.  First place="Great Lakes"; second="Great Times."  I am now officially living in Michigan.  Currently I have no furniture.  I do have, however, my computer and some clothes.  Today I met a fellow philosophy grad student, James, who showed me around.  Thus far, I have experienced great times.  Looking forward to the great lakes....
