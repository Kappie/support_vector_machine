Late homework, work I didn't even know was due, new homework...blah! But on a positive note, my mother has finally decided to let me go to Alma Youth Mix! Oh, joy! Now it is all a matter of turning in the application before Thursday...it  can  be done.  Of the books I bought recently, I began to read the Loners' Manifesto first. It basically is a grand overview of all things antisocial including history, mistruths, and other lonerisms. While this book is overall good and very well written, I've begun to pick up little flaws in the writer's philosophy. I've got three so far:  1.  The world is devided into two groups: loners and nonloners   I find this false because I am only a partial loner, brought up by a pure loner Dad and another loner-nonloner mix Mom. Basically this means I find joy in both "loner" activities such as music, art, reading, etc. as well as "nonloner" activities such as youth group, concerts, and dicussing things. While I am mostly a loner, rarely talking and commonly walking off or separating myself from the group, I still enjoy being part of the mob. I draw my water from both rivers and am full.  2.  Loners are always being put done by the majority nonloners  This may be linked to the fact that I am not a truth loner, but I have rarely if ever been mistreated or insulted for my loner ways. People tend to accept me as I am or ignore me. Worst case scenario, I'm misjudged and found annoying.  3.  Masturbation is a fun and interesting hobby for loners  When she first started talking about masturbation it was as a stereotype for loners and almost appearing a bad thing. I was relieved. Then she started promoting it and that relief died. I have done persverse and stupid things in my life, but suprisingly masturbation is not one of them. I thing she is only projecting the stereotype she reviled earlier by saying it is actually an okay thing. Masturbation....Ungh! I hope I never have to mention it again on this blog!  An interesting topic came up in English class today. My friend was talking about the personality test she took involving convergent/divergent minds and the conversation turned to revolutionary/fascist personalities. I myself am a diehard anti-statist. I loathe our government and almost all others as they are corrupt focal points of power. I also expressed my wish to burn down the White House. Now, let me clear up some facts about that before the FBI breaks in. I would first evacuate the White House of all personnel. As they left, I would had out complimentary mints and express my deep regret that they would have to lose their current employment. I would then commense in torching that building with the true and grand glee found in all pyrotechnics and arsonist. There is a little arsonist in everyone. Mine came out and gave a lecture today.
