I'll blog afterwards about it if I get the chance.    Big news!  My mom went to Promenade to get my cowboy hat for me while I was in school! I payed her back the $30 already. But yeah... She knew I wanted to wear it to Sudbury and all so she got it. At first she said no 'cos if we went after school, there'd be rush hour traffic, but I suggested if she could go while I was in school and so she drove all the way down there to get my cowboy hat and she had to look for the store in her sandals which made her feet hurt now. When I came upstairs from having an after-school snack, I saw a duffel bag on the ground and knew I was supposed to pack so I opened the duffel bag and saw a plastic bag inside. I thought my mom had already put my platforms (for the dance) in there and then I felt it and it was A LOT softer than my platforms so I pulled it out and saw... MY BELOVED LIGHT BLUE COWBOY HAT! I seriously was gonna   CRY!   I love my mommy! Hee hee~!   I talked to Megha on MSN today after school and yeah... it was an interesting talk... I was high though 'cos of my cowboy hat! ^^ Will came online (yes, my bro in Christ) and we talked. Haven't spoken to Will in ages! Hee hee! Speaking of Will, I think him and Becca are such a pretty pair! So cute~!   So yeah... Tomorrow, I'm gonna miss Nima a lot. He's on Coach A and I'm on Coach B! Boohoo~! *sniff sniffzZ* Lucky Vivo  Mark... and Moca  Poodle Boi, and Rach  Jae. Whyyyy meeeee?! RooflezZ~! Bleh... Oh well. I guess God didn't let me sit with him on the bus for a reason. I have no idea why but whatever. Maybe to get me less obsessed about him! Haha! That's what I call  over-obsession  where I think about him non-stop. So yeah... maybe to get me back on track and not ditch my friends so much. Hee hee!  Had guitar lesson today. It was... interesting. We did our unique versions of Amazing Grace and it was totally fun! Hammering, sliding, pull offs, etc!  Oooh, there's a concert on July 18 (the day after my birthday) at the Molson Amphitheatre and I sooo wanna go! Hee hee! My mom said it was okay with her as long as the tickets didn't cost too much. Hee hee~! It's Evanescence featuring Three Days Grace! I wanna go with Moca, Nima, and Krystal for sure! Hee hee! It's sooo cool! And guess what? Tickets cost from CA $19.50 to CA $45.00! Hee hee! I'm willing to pay $45 if it means being closer to the stage! It'll be so cool! We can all bus there or go by subway (or both) and it'll be so much fun! ^^   If things go well, (and if I behave like a good little girl) then my mom and dad will get me an electric guitar for my birthday! Yay! I know they can't get me the Iceman IC400 'cos it costs WAYYY too much but a Fender Stratocaster (same type as Sexy) would be just as good! If not, a guitar like Nathan's! It's acoustic but can sound like electric and looks similar to one too! Of course, I'm aiming for a Fender Stratocaster primarily. :D BLACK BLACK BLACK~! My fav colour!   Hmm, me planning something for the 100th day in this relationship. Don't know what to do yet but I want it to be special! Coming up in a few weeks! A surprise! ^^  I'm thinking about what to get Nima for his birthday. I'm TRYING to get a FOX Racing thingy... possibly a white FOX Racing visor... 'cos he seems to like to wear a white visor with his t-shirts. Hehe~! He looks really sexy like that too! ;) Iunno... I'll see.  Wow, dinner smells great! ^^ Me hungry~! :D Well, enough talk... I'm gonna go on MSN for a while! Hee hee~ Then I'll blog after the trip if I can get on.   Gonna wear my cowboy hat tomorrow! Hee hee~! Me crazy! :P   I may not say it quite as much as I should But when I say I love you Darling that means for good So open up your heart and let me in... And I will love you, until forever Until death do us part, we'll be together So take my hand, and hold on tight And we'll get there... this I swear   That was the chorus from the song  This I Swear  by  Nick Lachey . Hee hee~ And here's the first verse...   You're there by my side, in every way I know that you will not forsake me I give you my life, wouldn't I think twice Your love is all I need, believe me   P.S. I mean it. ;)  To all whose reading this, I wanna let y'all know that I love y'all! You guys are the greatest friends a girl like me can have! I love you guys so much! Without you guys, I wouldn't be Joey! Hee hee~! (this means you take the blame for my faults such as my brattyness! hee hee! joking!)  To a particular someone who may be reading this, you know who you are... I love you. You know that, or so you should. You mean the world to me and even more. In my eyes, you are way beyond perfect... and I love you. (wow, these amazing three words: i luv u, can sum up so many feelings and emotions... and yet it's so complex...)
