I will divide this introduction into two sections;    Basically,   This means I will host Audio, Video, Art, Text, and other stuff all one one   urlLink big huge server   known as my computer.  You can see all my stuff, and if you want, send me your stuff over MSN Messenger and I might post it! =D    But technically,   My 802.11b router had to be disconnected for the site to work.  Unfortunately, we need to have the router up so my mom can use the other computer that is networked to it, so until I find out how to negociate the site and the router to work together, there will be a problem.  If you have any information on how I could solve that, please inform me at stringtheory@gmail.com.  If you need details, it's a microsoft wireless router, 802.11b as I said before, and my server is running on Faststream NETFile 6.6.  I'm guessing the quickest solution is to use different hosting software, but this is free and yeah.  Well, I hope you guys like the changes! Keep checking for updates.  Love, Sean
