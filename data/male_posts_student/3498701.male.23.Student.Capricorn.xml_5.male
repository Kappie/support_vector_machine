Why do SOME people enjoy talking about other people behind their back so much that it become a habit that everytime when congregated in a group, the topic about certain person, be it close friends or strangers will surface. It is like a contagious disease spreading to other people in the group and causing the group to divide and becomes more sensitive towards certain issues. I agree that it is inavoidable to engage in light topics, or even diss and bitch,  In my own opinion, this is impossible to avoid because it is bound to happen that one day, you are just so pissed about certain matter or person that you just have to voice it out. Well, i believe that there is a healthy level to that and a choice can be made between: 1.voice it all out in the open, with the goal to gain crowd support and to have something interesting to talk about in the group, or 2.to voice it out with a close friend with the intention to sincerely express the personal unhappiness, done in such way that you want it to stay low profile, minimum damage, and resolved as soon as possible with the least amount of trouble. well... if it can be solved that is.  Gone is the usual carefree and fun elements, replaced by whispering and serious dissing and bitching about another human being in a big group as if it is a new trend. Unhappiness towards a single individual spreadt and shared, logic to dislike discussed and embraced. Rumours which might not be 100 % true are confirmed and believed. Silence in the group is almost taboo, something has to be spoken about and discussed regardless. It is disappointing. I am disillussioned. I cant deny that i am the guilty party the problem i have mentioned. Up to this point, I am going to make a conscious effort to refrain from all those.
