I just haven't been doing well cause i honestly came to the realization that I have no idea what is going on, and for like a month now I barely have known you. I guess it just sucks cause ive sent you so many emails and posted so much in the blog, but i still feel so alone. I just kinda snapped after seeing you online and the entire basis of the convo was me doing stuff for you. And no, I am not mad or upset with you, just upset in general. I just want things back like they were and I want you here and I just, I dunno. Me and jackie were talking about how its bad when you get used to being alone, even though you are dating someone.  I just love you and want to be with you, thats the bottom line. I guess the month has made me afraid of things changing, and I can tell somethings have. Nothing bad, no, but I just, worry. But I worry cause I care and I love.  So I am off to listen to some music, hope you are sleeping well and hope your days get better. You can get through this, and you are not alone.  *mwah*
