Funny thing about the blog...its January-March content is pretty weak in both 2003 and 2004, April picks up, and May is incredible.  I feel something similar on this internet horizon.  The last few days of writing have found more interest and casual banter, in my mind, than a semester full of forced entry, designed specifically to make sure Heath doesn't stop reading for lack of posts.    I always considered the blog to be on one side of the writer's balance, and my creative output on the other.  The blog is creative, granted, but I get no accolades for this...some mentioned in passing that I should publish a Best Of: copy, but what would the reason to buy be, considering it's all for free here?  Writing fuels the soul, but the blog was a break from the career of screenwriting, as evidenced by my blogging.  Last year at this time, I was beginning to turn out substantial posts, while my screenplay was receiving an untimely burial.  The summer was dedicated to blog, but once I got back into school, the site fuckered itself, and I started up on a pretty kickass story idea.  That finished, and the blog was reborn, and I got into it, but the posts were grueling and uninteresting.    But now, I'm enjoying the hell out of what I'm writing in the screenplay and on the blog.    Scott Rice wants the TAs to come into class on Tuesday and talk about our approach to writing, as if we are experts on the craft.  I know what makes a good screenplay, and I can give good honest criticism, playing good cop and bad cop at the same time for my students, but to stand in front of a group of people and tell them  I am a writer; this is how I do this  is so much more daunting than any class I've ever taught.  Maybe it is because I still don't trust my abilities...how can I when my published career is found wanting?  My approach changes every semester.  I've finished a grand total of two screenplays in my life.    The pressure of society is such an interesting burden.  Hemingway wrote from 6 to 12 every day of his life, according to the anecdotes, at least.   He'd wake up, no matter what he'd done the night before, and start rewriting what he had written the day before.  Once finished, he'd move on to new things.  The writing would end at 12, no matter where he was, and he would spend the rest of the day living.   Or Jack London,  who wrote 1000 words a day, everyday.  Didn't matter in what vocation, just the words.   And then there's James Joyce,  who could lock himself in a room for days, come out, and have someone ask him "How much work did you get done?" to which he'd reply "Two words."  The questioner would be shocked; so much time for so little output...but James would smile and say "They were two good words."     Problem with me is, my two words often suck.    I'm kind of on a writing high right now, however.  The script is plugging along marvelously, after some nearfall misses in the earlygoing, one of which killed my diary blog on the screenplay (how often can you post to a blog about a project that you loathe?).  I might have a finished draft by Friday...and full-well knowing the draft will suck, I don't mind.  I have motivations down.  I feel the story for the first time since I sat with Dawson Taylor in his Houston apartment in 2001 and we talked old Centenary days that weren't really so old and I thought, "This joke about filming this guy at a party could be so much more."    I woke up early this summer...sleeping in constituted a 10am wakeup, and I could stay up until 3 or 4 to make it there.  Tonight will be a testament to see if I've got that giddy energy back.  I want to get up at 10...class at 3, office hours thereafter, and who knows what next?  Got some grading to do tomorrow (as you see I'm not doing it tonight).    Ah fuck.  Alex Smith is on campus tomorrow.  Supposed to go to his shit in the afternoon.  An earlier morning call?    My computer just realized I'm not at JP's anymore.  Good work.
