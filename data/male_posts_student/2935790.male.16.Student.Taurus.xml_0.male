Mitch Hedberg is the world's greatest comedian, and I'm not even joking.  If you don't know him*, you should get to know him.  I'm not going to go on much more about him because I can tell by the look on your face that blah blah blah here's a quote;  "I have a feeling that a duck's opinion of me is strongly influenced by whether or not I have bread."  -Mitch  Until next time, Sean  * "How many of you people know me?  Well, if you don't know me why are you coming to my special?"
