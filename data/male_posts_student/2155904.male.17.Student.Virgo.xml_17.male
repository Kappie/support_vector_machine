His mom never expects him to do anything and now he actually doesn't do anything and she seems all shocked.  Right after school Purdy and Tyke got in Purdy's car and started to go to Albertson's when Tyke called Skippy and they saw him walking so they invited him to join.  So they all went there and they saw THING 1 and THING 2 at Albertson's in MONSTROUS SIZE!!!  I mean the size of Tyke's old My Buddy doll is how big it was!!!  It was great.  But it was like 20 bucks so the two spendthrifts decided to wait until a better time to make this purchase.  (Tyke just noticed that Skippy left his teriyaki in his house...that bastard)  But then Purdy drove the two back to the school where the three parted ways forever.  Well at least for a little while.  Tyke then met up with Skippy at Teriyaki Bistro (eh...) and they got some food and went to Freddy M's.  Tyke had called Mandy prior to leaving and she said that she was going to come over.  Also, Tyke had talked to Dottie about her maybe making an appearance and she said she might (but like the other girls in Tyke's life either forgot or decided not to try and make time for dropping by) but that is ok because this is Dottie's first time and she is really nice so he forgives her.  And she had a friend in from Seattle so he is alright with it.  But when Tyke and Skippy came home Tyke looked at the monitor and saw that Mandy had decided not to come over.  Damn, that is like 200 times in the past two weeks that Tyke has been either dropped by a girl, not been called back, not been called, or just flat out not hung out with.  Well more like 5-6 times but still it is getting old.  He is beginning to give up on his quest for a girl to cherish for just a girl to freaking hang out with on regular occasions!  Whatever happened to friends hanging out together outside of school!!!  And once a week seeing Friends together for about an hour and then meeting at the football game does not count.  Purdy has been out of town I suppose but that means that she better try and make up for it.  She knows how to do so too...(and if she doesn't don't worry, cuz I don't know either).  But anyway Tyke and Skippy spent the night watching Rich Girls, playing DDR, watching OC, playing DDr, and watching Aladdin.  When Skippy left Tyke continued to play DDR.  He is good.  Maybe the next time the girls hang out with him he can show them how good he is.  Whoa, Tyke just had a flashback to a dream he had pretty recently.  And it was actually more like a nightmare.  It was at night and Kinker and Emilio Testeves along with a bunch of other people were at Tyke's house.  Well it became scary and Kinker and Emilio were the bad guys.  Kinker made the lights go out and stuff and then he had knives and he started throwing them at people and they were killing people.  Tyke kept running away and then he made it outside but Emilio was outside and he had like butcher's knives.  Tyke knew that he must be on the deck so he slowly walked out from underneath it and looked up and sure as he thought he saw Emilio ready to hit him in the face with a cleaver.  But he missed with a couple and then Tyke picked them up, able to use them himself.  So then when he got in a chance to hit Emilio he missed of course and then he was down to one knife but he had an easy throw to hit Emilio in the back of the head but he missed and then Emilio had all the knives and Tyke was cornered.  Well he started to run away and by this time Kinker was back also trying to kill Tyke but Tyke thought he could get away by jumping the fence in his backyard.  Well to bring things to a close he tried but fell back into the yard and a little before Emilio and Kinker were coming over to kill him the dream ended.  That took a lot of room.  Do you guys want me to break the future recaps into more than one paragraph?  Just let me know.
