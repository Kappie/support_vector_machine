At least 3 friends in the past week have talked about this. I can't help but feel concerned about this mentality.  From a linguistic and psychological level, I think the term "losing weight" is extremely problematic. Men and women don't really mean "losing weight" as much as getting in shape. However, because the term "losing weight" is the verbal standard for conveying the idea of getting in shape, being fit, gaining tone, etc. it has implications on how people set their fitness goals. The problem with this is weight does not necessarily imply fitness. One can gain the appearance of fitness, without shedding pounds, since you might be replacing fat with muscle (which is heavier). This contradiction is no doubt one of the reasons why people do unhealthy things to reach their goals.  The concept of "losing weight" is a sensitive issue for me, because in high school I had to cut weight for wrestling. My off season weight was around 125 lbs, but my junior and senior years I competed at 103 lbs. Losing weight helped me win the league title at my weight class, but in retrospect I do think that what I did was borderline anorexic. On one hand, I have no sympathy for people who bitch about being "fat" when they don't do anything about it, and on the other hand it bothers me when people don't get in shape in a healthy fashion.  I'm just think of all this, since I'm making cookies right now.  ***
