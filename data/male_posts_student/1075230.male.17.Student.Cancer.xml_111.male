I guess I shouldn't have written that. But right now, I'm just miserable. And that's how I feel. And really, that's what this blogger was made for, expressing my emotions to the events that life throws at me, so ya, I just thought I'd write that down. Feel free not to comment, feel free to comment. Feel free to do whatever, just don't bring this up in future conversations trying to encourage me, because by then I'd probably be fine. It'll probably pass. Wow, even when I'm lugubrious I'm sickeningly optimistic. *sigh*  Meh .  -ArV
