"compre" " Compo" unless of course you say essay but then what the heck.  Ironically i did not finish my english homework and that vindictive teacher of mine who took away five marks from my common test becasue she felt my answers did not conform to the question sstructure. DO you even understand what she meant? hahaz. Denied me an A1 only one person got it anyway. Nabil  So i was told to attend detention for not completing my summary but i finished during class so i skipped detention hopefully she has got nothing to say, tomorrow morning at least. My english period was free since she was involved in the oral examinations for the Gcse's. But coniving women would never let us relax for a moment she makes us work like dogs, so it was a composition. Half way thorough class she appeared, and quite funnily somebody snickered and pass the comment " look who got kicked out of the oral exams..." ok maybe not funny but there is always that sadistic joy.  Math was terribly boring just as was physics, he seems stricter, Mr peterson.  I mean he is still his friendly enigmatic person with lots of charm according to Sarah but i feel he is more serious now about his homework...ha but fortunately i did it.  Bio was a total fiasco, we were blowing into the indicator to test for Co2 but of course Dillon had to play a fool and he had a patch of it fall exactly at you know where of a boys anatomy...don't blush. More irony just before that we were testing for the presence of water and he said we should test our urine, the spot of yellow looked like as if he was doing just that.  Do not feel upset, do not wish to be ignorant, i have told you and i because i trust you, Good luck on tomorrow to my speacial one. As to all others...but of course it would be normal for the rest of you unless you have math test like me.  I seem to have more math tests than dinners...  You know you love me, Byron
