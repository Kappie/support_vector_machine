I didn't really have much of a response either.  I read on the DPZ board some guys set of morals and I basically took those as gospel.  One of them was "No promiscuous sex" and he explained it, and I saw the logic in that.    Which I thought was funny.  Since most of my friends are virgins regardless, I still somehow feel the peer pressure "have sex" meme.  Funny.
