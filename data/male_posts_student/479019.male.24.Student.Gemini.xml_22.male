Read 10 pages of  Stepping Left , and then listened to Bad Religion on the Kevin and Bean show via KROQ's webpage.  Listening to BR on there is making me feel kind of pissed off I'm not going to see them at the Palladium. I kind of want to give a big middle finger to KROQ for making Bad Religion popular again, and an even bigger finger to the people who abandoned BR after  Stranger than Fiction  (1994). The only good things about this regained interest in BR is the fact that they probably won't be breaking up anytime soon. Well unless they pull something like the Police did in 1982.  Procrastination is my enemy!  Back to work.  Now playing is some Beethoven.  **
