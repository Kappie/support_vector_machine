Well I did catch a movie on HBO, but that is not something a person would consider as a worthwhile deed for the day, is it? I read somewhere that writing a diary is a very difficult habit to break, as difficult as it is to cultivate that habit. Well, I never had such a problem. I used to write a diary. But I broke it without giving much thought to it. Who am I kidding? I was feeling terrible quiting that habit. But all the notes I had stored on my computer got lost on fine morning just because my computer had a very bad day. I still feel very sad about that, just as I feel on losing 4 years of email, on a similar freaky day. I started writing a diary on a book, but I destroyed it one night becuase I felt that there was a chance it might be discovered by my sister and her friends. More than a dozen on her friends came to stay here for almost 10 days. Oh, those terrible days when I couldnt use my computer much... I still feel my heart ache when I think about it. I saw 'Cruel Intentions' on HBO today. I had no idea Sarah Michelle Gellar was sooo sexy!! Ofcourse she is wicked in it, and the movie is just an excuse to make a movie, but atleast the end was not that bad. I am a bit confused; because I think I saw the same movie but with a different story, I am not sure if it was 'Cruel Intentions' Part 2. In this movie her step-brother dies. So if any of you out there sees it dont confuse it, because the other one is just trash. If any of you know what I am talking about, then do tell me what I am talking about; I am confused. "I feel lonely... lo lo lo lo lonely" Nice song isn't it?  See ya all later. ;-)
