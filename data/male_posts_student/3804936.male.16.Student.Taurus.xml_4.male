Likewise, without darkness, light could not exsist. The two are polar opposites. Neither stronger than the other, neither weaker. What's that? You say that light always prevails in the end and pushes out the dark? Not true. The light may shine into the dark places and illuminate them yet the darkness simply flows around the edges, waiting and lurking. In its turn it will push back the light. and likewise will the light return to push back the darkness. It is a neverending struggle between two forces so evenly matched one can barely discern the differences between them. And so do good and evil fight.  And so do I choose evil. After all, if we are all pawns then what reason is there to be not? It all balances out you see. Without people such as me, that man there who gives away all he has to charities and is still cheerfull wouldn't seem half as good. Because if there were none such as me he wouldn't be. If everyone were like that it wouldn't be special. Instead he becomes a good man and is likely much loved by those around him.  Good for him I say. He has found what he wants, his nirvana if you will. And if he is happy then so be it. I myself will never be like that. And there is no middle ground in this war. There is no neutral. And so I turn to the darkness that is willing to embrace me. It alone accepts me as me. That is all I ask and all I recieve.    Hurting,   -Dant
