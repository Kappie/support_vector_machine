Backed onto our line I had no way of clearing the ball as Taj did not run behind me, as I was urging him to. The game was called off in the end as of excess rain, although continuing the game would of been fun.  Was woken up at 7:30 this morning to have a shower, however I didn't creep out of my bed until 7:45 (oooooooh such a rebel). A lack of Head  Shoulders shampoo meant "argh crappy stuff" that made my hair smell badly of strawberry. I did not like this, and had to put up with the smell of strawberry running through my hair until the rain cleansed it out at lunch.  Studied the Holocaust and Nazi propaganda in history and I managed to write a heck of a lot during the lesson, no one really had anything interesting to say so I just got on with my work.  Assembly was called off because of year 7 exams I think, but nevertheless it was called off and we went to tutor where I managed to eat a subtle amount of food.  In DT I managed to actually draw the outline for our woodwork projects, and I'm pretty sure I'm feeling ok today. Break managed to pass with nothing actually happening, and as I write this I do remember me and James discussing Eurovision as I was singing a part from the Ukraine entry, le woo for cheesy music contests.  Got sent out of Citizenship for being sarcastic and chatty, and put on a 'last warning', later to be warned again for eating sandwiches in class. I like my tutor, I think he can be funny at times, but I just have this feeling hes losing his, erm, how you say it, 'cool'. Heh, now I sound like an idiot. Michael told me he had Mr Tate for Science as Mr Maher was planning to give pupils in our class detentions on Monday. Of course, as usual, I misheard this and began to make poor one-liners.   "Mr T teahces you Science?! I pity the foo' that messes with sulphuric acid!"   Michael laughed though, so I suppose we have hope here in Swindon...  In French Katie made me wear her sunglasses and as I put them on, she took a picture of me on her camera phone. I only saw the picture at the end of the lesson and looked the foo' (oh yes, Mr T styley). I couldn't stop her from showing it to other people though, so I guess people laughed at it. Hell, it made them smile, thats good right?  At lunch James was a bit angry as Mr Runham had totally ignored him for twenty minutes in his Maths lesson when he needed an explanation to a question. The end result is as follows:     Tis a mad James, but if you look a little closer, you'll notice he's very organised, hes even remembered to update his blog! He'll have to give me the link some time so I can pimp his up.  In yesterday's entry I forgot to include some photos I had taken, so I take it upon myself to add these here now.     This was taken in Drama (so maybe it was a picture from Wednesday then :P) and is a shot of Dee trying to maul her fingers to death. Having the flash off caused one hand to not be blurred and another clutching a pen to be very blurred. I kind of liked the way it turned out, so I guess thats why its here.     This is a wall. +2 points for observation. I edited the colours very quickly in Photoshop otherwise this would have been a very dull black  white photo of a wall... Erm, I guess its still a dull picture of a wall anyway, but at least its in a good colour.     I guess I'm adding this picture for the sake of it. Its not really good at all, however I do believe that the high resolution copy of this picture looks way much better.  Going back to our lunchtime shenanigans now. *End cheesy transmission music*  The weather to begin with was very nice, good warm temperature, shining very brightly. Didn't do or say much, but at least it was good weather.     There isn't much point to this picture, but you can see that it is bright in that picture, and this was taken about twenty minutes before the rain really kicked in. I was playing rugby with James, Taj, Devon (haha), Jack and Joe for a while. I had already screwed up once, but to save face, I just blame Taj for not being behind me so I could pass to him. Rain had started to spit slightly but we still went on regardless of this, and then we had to call the game off because it really did start to rain then. I did taken an enjoyment to watching people run madly across the field to get shelter.     Look raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain! *ahem*  Bell went and I went into James' music room for a little while. Just before I left I looked across the room trying to find something. I had only just realised that I had lost my boot bag. Without thinking I found myself continually saying "Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger" right in front of Mr Sizeland. By now the class had found it hilarious, and I guess I did too, after all I was making a complete fool of myself. Mr Sizeland told me to go look for it and I quickly pounced off to my French class where I did indeed find my boot bag.  Went past James' music room again on the way to PE, knocked on the window, did a little celebratory dance whilst everyone laughed (again), and I could hear Sian shouting "Bugger, bugger, bugger!". The things I do to entertain people I tell thee...  High jump in PE, avoided it a bit, then got into it. In the competition I only got through to the second round, but went out of that after I think my shirt came into contact with the line. In the end Bobby won with a height of 165cm if I remember correctly.  With that done, my school day had finished and I went off home. But before I go any further, why not have a picture of some leaves?     Yes, didn't do much after school. Spoke to Rebecca and other people on MSN, watched The Lenny Heny Show and ate apple and raspberry pie.  Have to run into town tomorrow to buy myself a new book to use as journal when I am unable to get onto the internet and post something here, so maybe you'll read something more interesting in the near future. Today is firday, so the b3ta newsletter should be released. I'm off now, toodles.
