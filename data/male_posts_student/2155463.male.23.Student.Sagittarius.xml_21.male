How's this for my messed up fundamentalist background - it's because I know I ought to (b/c they are my parents), but I don't really trust them (I just think they've been wrong too many times before).  So basically, it's a lose-lose situation - listen to them and feel bad because I don't think it's the right decision, or not listen to them and feel bad because I think I  should  listen to them.  I think y'all can see the dilemma here...grrrr......
