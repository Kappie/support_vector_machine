Then I noticed that John Woo will be directing the film. I don't think I've ever gone from overdrive to reverse so quickly. John, stick to Hong Kong shoot-em-up action flicks. That's what you're good at. The Rainbow Six name is neither about slick gunplay nor fancy camera angles.   But who knows? Maybe he'll pull it off. If not, we'll have another  Mission: Impossible 2  on our hands.
