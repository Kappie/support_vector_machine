Settled the bbq thingy today...had emaths test which i didnt even understand what the questions were asking for...after that i went for clb...had a test, reached there at 3.45, left at 4. The test was okay...not very easy either, but i was in a hurry to finish it so i sorta randomed everything. Heh, o yeah, didnt meet stanley there this week, maybe next week cos he has sports day heats. O well...here i am now...  I promise you this. one day you'll walk into the tattoo shop of your life and say "I'm back. Im ready for my new tattoo. and her name is rock and roll.now its time to make it permanent." You will have been thru all the temporary 15 minutes of flash. You will have come to realize that you've been being served fast food music and disposable heroes so long you've somehow forgotten what is real and what is not. and you know what the man beind the counter will say? "WE KNEW YOU'D BE BACK." -Motley Crue-
