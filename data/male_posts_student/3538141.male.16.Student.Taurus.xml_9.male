I have no idea of their motive, I can only imagine that because I was on an expensive bike they saw me as a rich bitch, which I suppose to some extent is true.  They were both younger than me, but unfortunately they were in a car, so I assumed there had to be a driver, who I couldn't see.  It was unlikely that a parent would allow such behaviour, so I assumed it was an older brother.  The only reason I didn't give them all a knuckle sandwich was the situation I was in - at the traffic lights, one of me, three of them, one probably older, and on my bike which one of them could easily have stolen in any fight that may have ensued.  So anyway, having thus assessed the situation I decided there was nothing for it but to sit there for a long few seconds, having abuse and saliva hurled at me until the lights changed.  I now wished I'd hit the little bastards.  But it was probably better that I didn't.  Grrrr.  If I ever run into them again, when not in such an awkward situation, I won't hesitate.  The thing that annoyed me most was the motive.  'Look!  A rich kid!  Wow look at his bike I'm really fucking jealous.  I know!  Lets call him names and spit on him!  That'll make it all better!'  Little shits.
