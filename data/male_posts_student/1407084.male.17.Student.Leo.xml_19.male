I want to stay at home.. sleep until noon... wake up, take a 45 minute shower and go back to bed for the remainder of the afternoon. I want to wake up, again, and watch old reruns of old black and white television shows.. like leave it to beaver, and stuff. Anything but school. The Monster Mash is tomorrow night.. but I'm not going. I think I'll spend some quality time with my family, something that we haven't really been able to do for a while around my house. Maybe on Saturday I will go up to the cities.. spend all the money im saving for california. I don't really want to go to california anyways.   Ahh... i wish some people would grow up..   There's my blog. Do what you want with it.  And if you are female, don't waste your time over-analyzing it for hidden clues. You won't find them.
