Most of us must be mulling over where that anti-climatical first week went. Some people go places, others stay home to be entertained by TV, comp etc. A very small minority do work. (What a bunch of tossers!!!) But then the realisation comes that only a week is left. Many critics may say a weeks a long time (sport generally). Others, like me, totally disagree. Especially when u havent touched 3 assignment due in successive increments. However, i still dont want to begin any of them...  Wayne, going to Dee Why (or as you would like to call it "Whoop Whoop") to gather necessary info for the geo assignment is a good idea. Gather some interested people together and ill help organise it.
