CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, for passing down that "joke" CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, wish i could wash ur mouth with soap...  CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, it spread like wildfire without control, CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, i hope the other party din get to know...  CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, my reputation has flown the coop, CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, for revealing my b**bs!  !#!$!@#^@#$@    Lyrics by: Janet the Great  P.S For those of you who have absolutely no idea what the heck I just said...good.
