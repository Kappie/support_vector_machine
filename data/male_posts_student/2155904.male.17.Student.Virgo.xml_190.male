Like one of Tyke's friends actually.  It's really pleasant.  Tyke is quasi-watching Frasier right now as it is the series finale and the highlight show is playing.  They just had a clip of a chess match and now Tyke thinks he is going to go play himself at chess.  So that should be fun.  He better blog quickly then.  He has to go eat his ice cream too.  Busy night.  Busy indeed.  Today Tyke got 3rd period off which meant a little cake eating and dirty talk.  Just normal stuff you talk about when you are eating cake.  Tyke then played Lucky, the slave in Waiting for Godot, in English and got whipped and choked by a collar and really it was just a grand old time.  One time the leash broke so Tyke decided to ad-lib and he yelled 'I'm Free!' and ran out but the teacher didn't seem to think it was that funny.  Eh, screw her.  Speaking of her, Tyke saw her driving home from school when Tyke was leaving his house at like 2:50.  She had her arm out the window and looked like she was a butch cowboy, er, cowgirl.  But Physics was fun again today.  And then after school Tyke went home to get a microphone from his computer to work on planning Prom at Skippy's house.  So they did that and Tyke came home to do some more work and just hang out for a while.  Then he got dinner for him and his mom at JIB and ate that.  Then they talked about Ashland, and Tyke not being gay, and room situations, and not being gay.  Then Tyke watched the miraculous end, albeit annoying to Tyke as he does not want the Lakers to win, to the Lakers-Spurs game where Derek Fisher made an insane shot to win it 74-73.  Then Tyke came over here and blogged.  But he really wants to play Chess so there is no reason to write any more.  Here's a thought...what if Tyke, instead of writing how he does, used words like me?
