How do I draw the line between being a stick in the mud, and being someone that doesn't stand up to anyone.   How do you tell someone the truth when it makes them feel bad.   Why do people do things just to provoke the other person to feel bad?   I can't even tell when I am being stupid. I can't see myself talking. There is no mirror in front of me to show myself. I say things without caring, and people take them so damn serious and think I'm stupid. Why can't I just say things that I don't really mean. That's just how I operate.   Why do you have to joke around about me being stupid so much? I know you're kidding, but it just gets really irratating and makes me feel bad about myself.   I've done some weird things in the past few days, and I think I may have made a few REALLY important people feel bad. I really don't mean to, but watching all those people talk to you.. It drives me crazy! Yet, I can't tell the difference between me allowing too much and me suffocating you. What's the difference, how do I draw the line...I need to know, because if my ideas about how to tell when enough is enough were wrong, then I could have gone through a lot of unneccessary pain. Not that I'm not totally happy with things now, but I need to know, and you need to know, and everyone needs to know...   I am struggling with this so incredibly much, and I really need to figure out if I'm the only one..  I can't concentrate on anything because of that.     Feeling depressed Donnie
