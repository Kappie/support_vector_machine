This morning we're chatting online and he tells me he had the shittiest day of his life, literally.  Being the posterboy concerned son that I am, I freak out and think that he was serious and maybe his dad died, or the house burnt down, or his guitars spontaneously combusted.  No.  By "shitty" he really meant "poopiest" "crappiest", the day with the most fesces involved.  Now before you click that X please bear with me.   We have a house with a basement bathroom.  This requires a sump pump.  Your goods are deposited into a tank whereby they are pumped up to the main sewage level.  Sometimes these pumps break.  The only other pump breaking that I can possibly imagine as being worse are those giant oil pumps in Saudi Arabia that shoot flames like 1,000 feet into the sky.  That would suck.  The sump pump breaking is a strong second.  Yep.  It broke.  If you've ever wondered why plumbers charge so much, try fixing your own broken sump pump one day and you'll understand.  It's tantamount to, well, swimming in shit.  So my dad, being the iconic mister-fix-it that he is, did just that.  He fixed it.   What could be worse then a sump pump breaking?  How about a sump pump breaking and a toilet clogging all in one day?  That's right.  The upstairs toiled clogged and leaked into the floor which also serves as the ceiling for my dad's bedroom.  Needless to say, he slept on the couch that night.  To make matters worse one of our 100 dogs (I swear we only had 2 last time I was there) decided to lick my dad's face all night with the same tongue he probably uses to...well, I think that's enough detail.     Anyway, this goes out to my dad.  Thanks for going through all that, and then getting up in the morning to go to work.
