I am quick to assure them that I'd like to spend more time doing such things but alas I cannot due to my hectic school schedule.   I offer as proof some of the things I've been up to over the last few weeks. Exhibit A (labeled "CPSC 310 Assignments") appears to the left of the screen and consists of a list of links that will increase as time goes on. So I offer the opportunity to those who would question my loyalty and character to look upon those documents and take a second to imagine the ammount of work that goes into producing such a document. Not to mention the fact that it was done during the summer session and as such the time provided to doing so was much shorter than normal. So to those that this applies... read them, and then give a call so we can arrange a time when you can lick my scrotum.  R
