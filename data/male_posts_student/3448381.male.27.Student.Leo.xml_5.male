Thugs have bum rushed us like Neno Brown in New Jack City, stripped us naked, and held a shotgun under our mouths in the rain while they showed the world how intimidated we were of them in order to control the "Carter Building".    While these thugs were not the savage drug dealing bastards of New Jack City, they are just as dangerous.  Roaches, ladies and gentlemen, are truly the scum of the earth...right along side Aubin International and Transamerica.  What a pathetic existense the three entitities lead.  While I can philosophize with the buddhist dudes all day, I can never look at a roach and say it's one with the universe.  It's something other and therefore our duty to kill it as soon as possible.  They ran us out.  The fight to keep the apartment would have taken too long and our safety could never be garaunteed.  So we packed like Felix Unger and left, showing up to our Oscar Madison (Sarah) like political refugees.  Just one stop on the refugee trail.  Our next stop is Edith's.  While I am sad that we had to leave our place, I am happy to be back at sarah's and my dream of living with Edith one last time will come true.  A blessing in disguise maybe?  I know Meli is not the biggest fan of the situation because deep down she wants to feel like she is settled.  A little stability in these tumultous times would be nice but it's also exhilirating to be a wanderer.  No matter where we go, we are always where we are, and together we make our family in that place.  So I do see her point on not separating "just for a little bit".  A family sticks together.    But family also helps out.  They support.  And "6 pack friday's" at sarah's and "casita" at edith's is support.  As for those other cock-a-roaches, Aubin and Transamerica...if i could Raid them I would.  If I could Boric Acid them I would.  If I could step on them, pick them up with a tissue, give the tissue a little pinch to squish them and make sure they were dead, then flush them down the toilet so they're carcasses would join the rest of New york city's shit and piss...I would.  Suing them is out of the question.  So here is my official list that I send a big "fuck you" to:  1. Mayonaise 2. Pigeons 3. Cockroaches 4. Aubin International 5. Transamerica  Peace,  /Chaunsee
