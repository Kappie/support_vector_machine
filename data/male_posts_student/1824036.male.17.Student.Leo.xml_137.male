Now the Bad News Bears....we had to run hills. We ran the hill out by sumner ave. It was deadly. For someone like me..who is only in tip top physical condition during late summer into the winter months (football :) :P ) it was hell....pardon the french. We ran the hill 12 times...not much? Well you go out and run it without getting winded...then we will throw a parade for you...  word life...
