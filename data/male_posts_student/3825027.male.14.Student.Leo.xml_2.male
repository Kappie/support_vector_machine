Well it's not stupid I just wanted to start my own thing The run this morning was really hard i think it was because of the heat I ran like the whole way except a few times I had to "catch my breath" I came home and drank two cups of water then took a cold shower to calm myself then I was reading my magizine for a while while I rested and stuff, well i woke up at like 11 so I coulnt run when it was cool outside thats why I always run int he morning at like 6 yeah thats damn early but it gets you up and stuff it feels good. My dad was supposed to wake me but didn't and he said I didn't tell him but I really did trust me. Well that's all of my first entry of the "Blogger" life.
