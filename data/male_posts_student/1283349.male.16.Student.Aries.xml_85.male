When I'm at work, or anyplace that has hallways, people tend to walk down them, often right by me. When they pass, they flash a brief smile and say, not ask, "Hey Caleb, how's it goin'?" and then they're gone. No chance for me to reply. How should I tell whether or not is is in fact going, and if so, how it goes in two seconds or less? Doubleyew Tee Eff, seriously. It just bugs me. They don't even want to know how it's going.  I suggest a simple "Hi," or maybe a, "Yo!" Whatever floats your boat, really, so long as you don't expect them to answer a question in the half second you're still face to face.
