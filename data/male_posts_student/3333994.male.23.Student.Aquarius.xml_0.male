They service a lot of elderly people and she told that some of them have been responding other patient's name to get ahead of the waiting list.  A typical incident will involve an elderly patient who seems in a hurry or just doesn't want to wait to see the doctor.  When the next patient's name is called they will jump up and beat them to nurse who is calling them.  If the nurse does not know the individual by face then they will assume that the person who is responding to Joe Smith is in fact Joe Smith.  These patients do not realize that they may receive treatment for someone else's ailments.  They think that by cutting in line they will see the doctor first and he will know who they are.  This is not always true.  There have been cases of patients receiving unnecessary surgery or surgery on the wrong sight because they refuse to admit who they really are.  Since this has come to light the facility where my mother works has changed its policy.  They now require individuals to show id when they are called to see the doctor.  They also have to go through three identification checks before surgery is administered.  This seems to be redundant but when people act dishonestly simply to save time it is necessary.  I am shocked that people would answer to another's name and go along with the shame the entire visit.  Strange things happen in the health field but this was something I had never even thought about.  Any comments???
