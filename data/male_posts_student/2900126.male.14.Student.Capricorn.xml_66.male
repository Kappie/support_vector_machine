But yeah I feel really bad that I'm not using it and she spent all that money getting me the help. And even though I know that it might be able to help me get into IMSA because I have to take the SAT 1 test I'm too lazy to do it. I really need to get focused again before we go back to school. Speaking of school, I want this high school experience to be a good one (although I've heard that for many people it wasn't) and I just hate it when people talk to me like I'm some 4 year old that was just released from "Cradle for Dummies Institution" *made-up organization to show emphasis on my hate for the condensendence of teachers*. I can't wait until I go to Florida it's gunna be so much fun, just hope Mustaafa doesn't cause me any problems, if I use my allergy medication I should be ok. I really should be reading my book or working on that "College Coach" thing instead of watchin tv and staying on the computer. ~^~ LAZINESS WILL BE THE END OF OUR YOUTH~^~ I don't know why but I love school and I love to learn and some people call me weird because I do. I think that my only reason for living is to learn because sometimes I think that I will just stay in school all my life and try to learn all I can or I could just learn by the means of books, internet, and experiencing the life that I have on this earth. But that's just me although I have low confidence, I really like to go after the things that I want and try my best to get them.  I have a question. If you constantly talk to yourself when you're alone about your life and what happens to you and what might happen to other people, even if it's the simplest thing like what you will be like in the future, what the world will be like in the future or just anything at all like family and friends, does that make you crazy if you talk to yourself about things that you think matter?  I love you Chichi, Sonya, and LinZ and feel free to post in your blogs about this if you're reading this. Anybody can post if you want and you can post about my blogs anytime I post so I don't have to keep typing the same thing at the bottom of every post that I make. ^_^
