At first, I though he was kidding, you know how people say you did awful and then say "Congradulations, you did it!" but not in this case. Apparently I was worse than I thought.  Alright, so we go to the Wilkes-Barre DMV in Hanover and my mom and I wait for like 20 minutes. In the meantime, I get very, very nervous. I look around the car and see the parallel parking portion of the test, and it looks very tight/difficult from where I'm looking. And I'm keep cursing to myself, wishing I had practiced it more.  It begins. He says to turn on the right/left turn signals, hazard lights, brake lights, and locate the emergency brake. All of that worked, except it took me a split second to figure which way to turn the bar (up or down) to make the turn signal go right or left. I felt like such a moron, and my nervousness was getting worse.  The parallel parking is the first part of the test, I do it flawlessly on my first try. Or so I thought. This guy is like a mute and only gives directions and never any details. So I say, "Is this good enough?" And he says, "Why are you so close to the car behind you?" So I put it in drive and move the car exactly in between the two vehicles. I ask, "Here?" He's like, "That's good enough." At this point, I'm like what the f*ck? I'm no perfectionist, but that's pretty damn good. I'd like to see you do it in a 4-door Volvo.  The second part is the road driving section. Apparently, as I was turning onto the road out of the DMV, I got so caught up in not getting in a crash, not speeding, not using my turn signals, etc. that I missed a very critical speed sign right at the turn that said 25 MPH. Mind you, this is in an industrial park in Hanover where the trucks are easily going 40 MPH or higher. I miss this sign and go at ~35 MPH for the duration of the test.  I am still considerably nervous. This guy is mumbling directions to where he wants me to drive and I have to try to make it perfect without a lot of time to think. We drive around a little. The only part at this point where I think I might have messed up was braking a bit too hard by making a left into a small parking lot. No big deal I thought, no way he could flunk me for that.  Long story, made a bit shorter, I saw a speed sign for 35 MPH on the way back and I am relieved. Ee get back to the DMV. He told me I did "very poorly." I must have a hell of a shocked faced. I thought I did fairly well, considering I know people with licenses now, and their certainly not the safest of drivers. He said I failed to use turn signals while parallel parking (true, but give me a break), went above the posted speed limit (later I realized I missed the posted sign while trying to make a left, very confusing because it's 35 MPH one way and 25 MPH the other), made a yield on yellow (he said what I did was legal and safe, but still "should have waited"), didn't stop before the white lign (I believe I did, but I was really nervous, so it's possible), and didn't have both handles on the wheel at all times.   The last part really ticked me off and when he showed me how I "supposidely" did it, he wasn't even close to what I did. Normally when diriving, I have my left hand at the ten o'clock position (in order to turn) and my right hand "circling" the lower bar at the five o'clock position (to "stabilize" my driving). Or course I realized this was wrong before I took the test, and I remembered the stupid ten/two o'clock position for my test, but I must've accidentally switched back momentarily. For sharp turns, I don't see how you can have two hands on the wheel every single fraction of a second. It's my belief you should use the steering wheel the best way that works for you.  Everyone really anticipated me passing. I was hugely disappointed for 3-4 hours. I'm kind of over it now. I rescheduled for next Thursday. I hope I don't get the same guy. I know there's really no point in practicing, but I don't know any other way to ensure I don't fail again. Wish me better luck next time!
