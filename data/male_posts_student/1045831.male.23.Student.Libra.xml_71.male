BUt we did have an amazing amount of kidness shown to use.  Texas is full of great people.  Especially Younger's Girl, Stephanie and her family.  Extremely welcoming nice folks.  But I have beeen living in a car since fri.  SO I'm off to jump in the shower.  BUt if you need someone to be nice to ya..  drive to Texas..  those people are awesome..  but I will give you the low down on everything that happened in a while..  I'm out..
