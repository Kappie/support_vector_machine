Secondly, iTunes is being a jerk that really gets into crashing and taking the machine down with it. And thirdly, Audioscrobbler doesn't base it's data on your iTunes library; it bases it on how many times you play the songs while this specific plugin is running, which is a real bummer because I listen to a lot of music while I'm not on my computer, or running that little plugin. Sometimes it makes other applications sad for some reason, so I'm forced to quit it >_  My Get Up Kids count should be around 400 songs higher than it is on audioscrobbler. It should also have a real top 50 favorite artists, but it doesn't because, like I said just a moment ago, it doesn't base it on the iTunes library file.  Sigh. Mucho grande la bümmer (I know it doesn't make any sense, but I think it sounds funnier than "Much big of bümmer").  That is all.             -- Feanor.
