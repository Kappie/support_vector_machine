Saturday we got a doggie!!!!!  Her name's Martie (short for Martini...at least that's what I say) and she's part doberman so she's colored like that...black and brown...and has a brown eye and a blue eye.  Isn't that awesome?!  She's the sweetest dog you'd ever meet, too.  Yay for doggies!  But then, after that, I SAW BEN FOLDS!!!!!!  OMG.  The only reason I'm telling you guys is because my TOD isn't working.  BUT HE WAS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  I would have his children ANYDAY.  haha, sorry Marten.  :D  If you have never heard of Ben Folds you should wear the hat of shame.  He is God.    It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
