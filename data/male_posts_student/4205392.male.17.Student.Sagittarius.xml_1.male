I've been called many things in the South -- a kid even came up to me once, clasped his hands together solemnly, bowed slightly and said "how". Apparently the racial separation between Native Americans and the Asiatic peoples is less distinct than I thought. Anyway, I went down into the lobby of our splendid Super 8 motel to get some watery coffee with my mom and dad. We went outside, wandered to a nearby convenience store, sipping coffee and feeling the hot wind blow across our faces. A truck came by, big bass beating. "Chink!" Some muscular guy in a wifebeater shirt shouted at us. The truck had about 5 people in it -- a blonde girl excited by the lights, sounds, and sights and a couple of guys in the back laughing uproariously at the wifebeater's clever and witty use of rhetoric. IT really is the end of the line when your only excitement is driving around drunk in Idaho, shouting chink at passing Asian tourists. I half considered taking a picture but decided against it, realizing that the wifebeater could easily tear my limb from limb and very likely had the inclination to do so out of sheer spite.   On a separate note, I had a nice chat over the phone with one of the former Magnet Elite. Like me, he also moved shortly after Freshman year. It's really really cool to meet someone who has gone through the same struggles you have with moving, adjusting to alien cultures, eating ramen with ice cream, discovering the use of asyndeton, etc. I gotta stop writing before I get all choked up...
