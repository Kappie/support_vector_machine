After tuition,I kinda had lunch, then sat on the sofa watching TV... until 3.30pm,a wave of tiredness hit me... and I slept on the sofa till 5.45pm.   Had a bath when I successfully dragged my body into the shower, and felt kinda refreshed after that. Still, a tingling blurness hung on to my senses...Then began doing my stuffs when Aaron called me up, not so long after. Time was about 6.20pm.. and he asked if I wanted to go eat out at around our area (Kovan, Hougang..)   So I agreed, still somewhat surprised and kinda glad someone actually called me out. And not too far at that. Yeah, so headed to the bus stop opposite PLMGSS to meet him, and we walked to Kovan.. had a little chat on the way, too. Time somehow passes by quickly if you have someone by your side talking to you...   Decided to get a plastic cover for my newly bought T630.. after all theblack cover cannot be taken out and washed, so i decided that a cover over it might be better... dont wantthe oil on my face to stain the hp... I do wash my 6230 sometimes.. thanks to the Express-On Covers... its just a breeze. Wash and dry. Thats it.  Although the guy took a long time to find the cover, I feel its great that its just $2, and I'm planning to buy another1 for my tuition teacher, and 1for myself as a extra cover (my neighbour didnt want it, he got the pouch liao)   Headed to Hougang Mall to test out the FDI bought from Aaron, met WanXiang along with his girlfriend I think. Argh, the FD wheel locks like no tomorrow ! Straightways also can wheel lock, and have u eating the wall... but its a good car overall... if I can counter the wheel lock, I suppose. Had a few battles with a Evo 4 with my half tuned FD... its gay how the Evo 4 dusted me on Irohazaka... >.  Played till 8.15pm when me and Aaron headed to KFC to have our dinner, and talked a bit on my problems again... Well, what was not so surprising was that what Aaron said, was what everyone said. Studies first.Love, later.How many times did these words enter my ears... Still, my mood gets the better of me... and something good will happen if I'm in a good mood... vice versa. Anyonecan tell mehow to overcome this ?   So... it was home after that, took 62 home.. along the way Aaron showed his picture collection on his hp to me... damn ! Walking multimedia centre !! Powder-ful 6600.... haha. Will try to have him send the pics to me sometime... hehe.   Yeah thats about it, asimple day, but rather fun. Will be sleeping later, since I caught a wink this afternoon, and I've left quite a bit of homework to do for tomorrow... yeah, I expect to be sleeping at around 1.30am ? Haha... gotta catch up on my work.. otherwise the new week will have me exhausted... and left behind..   Night peepz ! and.. Happy birthday to Karie ! (Lol... forgot to wish it to her today... so yeah, I'll just leave it here, although she cant see this...)
