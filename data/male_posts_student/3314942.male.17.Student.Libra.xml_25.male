I cleaned up most of the room, except for a little stack of papers in the corner, i had a train to catch, and i told him i would do it in the morning. He exploded screaming at me that if it   could   be done, it should be done. i could have easily cleaned up the mess the next morning, without any delay or inconvenience to anybody. he is from a generation that demanded something different. it wasnt teh fact that you could clean something later, its just that it could be done now, so why not get it done now instead of waiting until later. i ended up catching the train, and i did clean up the pile of papers...  the train took me to Grand Central, and my feet carried me to Penn Station, and from then on it just got weird. i met Scott Satkin, a long time friend from The Rock, and we were going to a Neil Young tribute concert in Prospect park. to sum up the day there are a few key quotes:  upon meeting one of scott's friends, he didnt even say hi he just said "i need a yo-yo", and thus we went to find him a yo-yo.  so we began to walk to the subway station, and we ask a cop for directions to Prospect park in Brooklyn, O:Excuse me officer, whats the best way to get to Prospect Park? Officer:Prospect Park? Why do you want to go there? O: We are going to a concert there? Officer: You guys are crazy. Do you know what your getting yourselves into?  Scott: YUP! Wait...maybe I dont.  Officer: All you white boys down there...you dont know what your getting yourselves into. Your crazy to go down there.  Prospect Park was one of the nicest, seemingly safest places i have ever been to in NYC.   On the F train to prospect park, a debate arose over the movie A Day After Tommorow, it pinnacled when scott said "DOES ANYONE ON THIS TRAIN NO THE FREEZING POINTS FOR DIATOMIC GASES?"  It was even funnier, when a random guy on the train with a PHD in Chem told us......  At the concert we were sitting there listening to Iron and Wine and scott turns around and says to the guy behind him "Could you please stop tapping the back or my chair, or at least do it to the beat of the music?" Guy: "My foot hasnt left the ground in 10 minutes" said in a gruff voice Scott: turns around quickly and shuts up.....  After some strange performances, and some really amazing ones, Scotts friends decided to bounce, and so Scott and I left with them to find one of their backpacks in the "Manhattan Lost and Found"....we eventually found the back pack and hit up a Bubble Tea Cafe, and we all had delicious japanese beverages with a waiter who knew nothing about agar (to the dismay of scott who looked up the exact definition up on his phone)..it turns out its a marine plant whihc is used for medicinal and cuisinary purposes... after bubble tea scott and his friends dropped me off at the Subway at 11 15 whereupon the train i took did not stop at grand central so i got off at Times Square. got to times square at about 11 30 and went to teh S shuttle, which turns out is not in service (which nobody informed all us standing there)...so that was 15 minutes wasted...so have to take 7 train ot Grand Central, but that doesnt leave for an additional 20 minutes as it needs to collect passengers....so its about 12 40 when i finally get to Grand Central, and this is when teh express leaves...i missed it by 2 minutes and had to wait an hour in grand central with these drunk guys who kept hitting on 14 year olds. weird. it was alright in the end, even when i got home to find my bed was stripped of sheets, and thus i am now about to sleep on the couch...its 3 30...i got home 30 mintues ago....  best bands at Neil Young Tribute: Iron and Wine (David Beam has the most amazing voice) Cat Power  Eric Mingus Sun kil Moon Bonfire Madigan
