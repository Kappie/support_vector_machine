(queue flash back music) it was a warm September evening back in 2003, unusually warm for that time of year when the leaves change to different shades of orange, yellow, and red. Boredom ran amuck, and in a small Albertan town there is little to do. That fateful evening will live forever in infamy. it had been planned for some time, while the exact details of the night were ever changing, the basic idea of the night was always the same...get loaded. as i look back upon it now i realize that i had forgotten one very important thing, when you drink you get drunk, and when you get drunk you lose the ability to think. that being said, i now go back to the situation. i had had a few drinks already, and was finding walking to be difficult so i had Errol mix my next drink...i think he said later on the it was 3/4 rum and rye and 1/4 coke (it could be different but i'm not sure). Needless to say, it tasted like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe. Then i was convinced by a certain dip shit that i should drink it really fast so i wouldn't have to taste it...big mistake, things got a little hazy after that...well after the next drink that someone else made me, once again the fast drinking came into play.  (return to the present)  I bided my time, waiting for the moment to strike. the time came yesterday, after a long time since the incident i had hoped he had forgotten my vow of revenge, and he did. What did i do you ask? well i was at school being bored, and the perfect prank hit me. (after some inspiration from other people) i went around my school to all the recyling bins and took all the pop bottles that had any amount of pop in them and poured it all into 2 bottles (2 because i was hoping i could get someone else at the same time). He drank it, but me being me i couldnt let him drink more then that first drink. but the payback was complete, indeed wasn't it errol? en garde! -Matt
