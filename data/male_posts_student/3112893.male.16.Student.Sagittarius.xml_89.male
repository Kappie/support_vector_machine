So, I was walking from the Kendall T Stop here in Boston to this pizza place called Emma's, which is really good, by the way. And I see this sign that reads something like "Lost Cat. Reward $600". The first thing I thought was damn, that's a lot of money. Then I thought, aww, what a cute cat. Then I thought, my cat's not really cute at all, she's old and fat and balding and getting stupid and mean. I would probably pay less than $50 reward for her. For 600 bucks, someone might actually spend time to look for a cat like that... Then it hit me!  Why not make semi-absurd sign that offers a massive, but realistic reward for something either incredibly common or incredibly hard to find. And so I visualized this sign in my head that read something like "lost possum. $300 reward" and I started giggling to myself after imagining a guy looking for a possum to bring me for his $300. What a fool he would be. Then my thoughts grew more humorous, to me anyway, and I began to think about putting Lost [x] signs up for things that are by definition fixed. Like "Lost Oak Tree. Last seen on the corner of Arlington and Main. Has 'I [heart] Shirley carved in bark' and 'Scott  Tiffany forever' etched inside a heart on the other side. Reward $400 cash." And then I would have the whole thing set up with a hole in the grass on one of the corners of the intersection about the size of a tree's trunk. Oh, how fun that would be. I mean, beyond a certain extent, it's not very funny, but I think it'd be very funny to see a Lost [x] picture like that... Or where the reward was something useless like "Reward 30 Twinkies" or something.  This was a waste of time, but it made me giggle. On an unrelated side-note, on that trip to Emma's, I found a 20 dollar bill lying on the ground and had a hard time deciding whether or not to take it. I ended up taking it after my dad said "God, Feanor, just pick up the damn money. Finder's keepers in these situations. If you don't pick it up, someone else will. It's not like the guy will come back and get it." That was 110% irrelevant.  That is all. -- Feanor
