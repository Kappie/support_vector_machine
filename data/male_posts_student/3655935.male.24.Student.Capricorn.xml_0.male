The Archbishop is head of the Anglican church and an avid fan of the Simpsons.  Soon after openly praising the show for its humor and humility, he was asked if he would be willing to do a voice on the show, to which he replied affirmatively.  While no official agreement has been set, both sides are willing to make it happen, so I’m sure it eventually will.  Many evangelical Christians oppose the Simpsons, saying it fails to promote family values.  True, the show fails to provide a model for most families, but this criticism fails to see what the Simpsons is about.  In many ways, the Simpsons is a critique of Western culture, pointing out its flaws and absurdities through a  reductio ad absurdum  played out on a cartoon.  Unlike many American evangelicals, the Anglican Archbishop gets it.  While I am not an Anglican, I say “Hooray” for the Archbishop being willing to participate in one of our culture’s most popular and influential parodies.  The “cynical truth” portrayed by popular icons like the Simpsons and David Letterman could provide a model for revealing Christian truth to the next generation that also gets it.
