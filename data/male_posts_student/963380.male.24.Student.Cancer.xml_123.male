My dad and mom went to see the Dave Bowie Set - a three piece group starring Dave on the piano - six weeks before  Ground Control to Major Tom  hit the top ten. Quoth my father "It was crap." That in and of itself is not terribly surpising - after all, Davie hadn't quite hit his stride at that point. My mother echoed "He looked like a big girls blose, platform boots like I had on, shock of red hair, white face.... eeugh."  So the day after this crap concert my dad is playing football - soccer - on the pitch at Ansells. On the side lines is none other than David Bowie and his managers - my dad's team was playing against a team of local doctors and Davie, apparently, was related to one of them. After the match was over my dad and his mate walked up to Mr. Bowie and said "Dave, caught the show last night, you were crap." "Yeah, and ye can't play the piana either".  From what my dad tells me, Dave took it in stride with a grin on his face. His manager said that he was going to be the next big thing in rock and roll.   Six weeks later, he was.
