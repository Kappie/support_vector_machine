Well, my Easter weekend started off on a MAJOR downside ... so ya, turns out doing that Biology lab (look below) gave me an infection and due to this infection i was coughing and spitting up blood. So ya im sitting in english class and this blood starts coming out of my mouth so my teacher Mr. Barton like FLIPS out and like runs to the office and calls my parents and tells them to take me to the hospital. So ya they did and now im on like 4 bottles of medication and the blood was suppose to stop but so far its gotten worse.  Of course yesterday was also  GAME 1  of the Leafs vs Senators playoff series .. THE battle of Ontario. The game was going all fine and dandy until  THE COCK SUCKER REFS CALL 2 PENALTIES WITHIN 20 SECONDS THAT WERE BRUTAL!!!!!!  Then the Sens scored on the 5 on 3, and then the 5-4 to take the lead, and ended up winning game 1. Thats alright though, I called Leafs in 5, next 4 games are gunna be the Leafs.  So ya .. this post doesnt exactly say much about Easter ... but if you live in Canada ... ok wait thats wrong ... if your me and my dad Easter basically means a 4 days weekend with lots and lots of hockey to watch.   GO LEAFS GO!!!!!   *just a quick note .. as you can see we now have a title heading thingy ... yup, i thought the way Lauren has her blog is really cool so im stealing the title idea lol*
