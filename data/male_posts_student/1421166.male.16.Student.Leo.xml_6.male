Which in the end, I didn't study for at all. But really don't know what to expect. Cause no idea what I was writing anyway. Well, at least won't be using it for L1R5...haha...Then there was a last minute decision of having sectionals. Argh...I was going to meet Baoshun to go BBC...but didn't care anyway, just left immediately after my paper. Then after thinking for very long, I decided to buy and ESV Bible. And I only paid $3.90 for it!!! Envious? hehe...well, ended up at Payar Lebar CC...playing basketball. But didn't really play la...just play a little and watched most of the time. I felt so lousy ( I am actually ), but played a little with our own people. And then practiced shooting and dribbling...yeah! Then after that went to Mac's for "dinner" Couldn't finish the fires again. But the conversation somehow lead to Geography then History. hehe...my Humanities subjects. I love history. Then ZQ wanted to challenge my History...but OK la...at least he couldn't deal with me when it came to Russia...haha...but it was all in Chinese. So a bit hard, but fun. Then had ZQ and Daxing send me home. Then Daxing was driving (hmm...wonder if he has a license???). Well, talked about History of China and some of those ideologies like Communism and even Confucianism. OK...gotta go and do my QT. Tomorrow's Labour Day. Hope can go jie's house to play basketball. Or study also can.
