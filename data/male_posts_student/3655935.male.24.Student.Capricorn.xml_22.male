As many of my insightful readers may have surmised, I just passed this mark.  At first, I was elated to discover I had actually finished a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter.  But, then, it struck me: I just finished a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter!  Unfortunately, I could not conduct a “jelly test” because I bought two different types of jelly in order to give me some semblance of variety.  I was told by Allied that my stuff should be delivered by this Friday (no less than 15 days past the latest estimate they originally gave me).  Moreover, since they have not lived up to any promises they have made thus far, I’m not sure if I can expect to have furniture before the weekend.  If not, tomorrow I crack open a 40 oz. jar of peanut butter, and should I empty that one before my stuff arrives, I think I’m legally permitted to go to the national headquarters and… and… and… uh, do really bad things.
