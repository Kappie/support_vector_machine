Ok, so my sister, who looks remarkably like Christina Ricci, is about 33 now. She's a 5th grade teacher at Perryville Elementary in MD. About twelve years ago my uncle introduced her to a silver star, purple heart, paratrooper, Gulf War veteran, Steve. Steve was a brilliant, well read, multi-lingual military machine. He was 5' 8", and weighed about 160 lbs of lean muscle. Right out of the war he was given a job as one of the top officials in the US's war on drugs and life was looking great for him. Amy, my sister, and he fell in love and were wed at my grandparents restraunt. He had already had a son from a previous marriage, Alex, but that kid stayed in CO with his certified lunatic mother and her boyfriend. As time went on Steve left his high-paying narc job to pursue a career in computers. He developed a knack for macintoshs' and started a small independant business, MacGurus. Soon the business grew, as did Steve, and with the advent of the internet business was looking promissing. Computers were everywhere in their small Delaware appartment, and Steve's obsession with them grew. Soon he would find himself basking more and more under the cool blue luminescence of his giant RasterOps computer monitors, replacing his tawny, sculpted Spanish face with that of an obsese, pallid, gnarly pig face with a grisly, unmaintained Rasputin beard. MacGurus eventually expanded to the point where they needed a new headquarters, so Amy and Steve moved to Wilmington. Steve's spending was becoming excessive, he was fixated on the idea that his business would bring in millions, but in it's five years he was lucky if it brought in enough money for a half a years worth of groceries. Amy had gotten a teaching job and she and steve were surviving solely off her five-figure income. Steve continued to indulge himself. As my sister worked all day teaching retards and autictics, Steve took 8 hour naps in the tub, shopped online with my sister's credit card, went out to Borders to amass his library, and probably sodomized the dog. We all thought he was a bit crazy and his spending habbits were a bit excessive, but we though he was a nice guy--we loved him-- so we didn't complain much. Then the camel's back broke and my sister had to leave him. This was a few months before their tenth (or twelfth) aniversary.    Alex, Steve decided back when he and Amy were still trying to salvage their marriage, should live with them in Wilmington. Alex grew up without a father, in the household of his insane mother and grandparents and was most likely abused as a child. He had, as my sister later found out,   Asperger Syndrome  . Basically, he was obsessed with science and thought he was a genius, but he was a complete idiot; he rambled incessantly about stupid inventions and ideas of his and it was embarrassing how dumb he was. He started getting into trouble in school and they had to send him to a "special school," a school for idiot lunatics; he thought it was a school for geniuses. Eventually he got weirder... Steve wound up finding gay porn on his computer. He was acting sadistic, he told lies to get Steve in trouble with the cops, he was abusing the dog, and he was becoming physically violent towards my sister.     It was around the end of 2003, and Alex was causing all kinds of problems; manipulating people, hurting himself and then telling his teachers he was being abused at school, etc. Then he decided he was lonely or something (though I think he did it to cause more problems). He went soliciting older men for sex over the internet. He met a guy named "Brian" online. One day Alex called Steve from school and said he wasn't coming home, he was "going to a friends house." When Amy got home and heard Alex's message she knew something was up because Alex didn't have any friends. So Alex walked to a church near their house and waited for Brian to pick him up. From there they went to a motel off I-95 where Alex had what I would imagine to be the most bizarre gay sex ever with the 30-something year-old elementary school teacher and youth-sport coach, aliased "Brian," who drove three hours from New Jersey for the event... Alex came home to find the police waiting for him, going through all the files of gay porn and sex solicitations that the queer boy saved on his computer. My sister had enough of that kid and his fucked up father, so she left.    Steve went to the VA because he didn't have money and he figured he could get about $2000 a month from the government for his PTSD. There he realized he couldn't stand living with other crazy war veterans, so he found a mercinary job in Baghdad, where he worked for 6 months and made about $50,000. He came back on Superbowl Sunday and stayed with us for three months; my sister had since moved in with her new boyfriend.    At the beginning of the seperation, when Steve went to the VA, my sister moved out of the hose in Wilmington. We went in there and took all the computers, (about 8, with three monitors for each) where we found thousands of dollars worth of hardware that Steve never used which was by now too outdated to sell (probably about $40,000 worth of stuff that was never used, plus the computers). Then we took the boxes of clothes that Steve had packed and brought them to our barn. After that we boxed up Steves library which he had collected over the years; over two thousand titles, some in foriegn languages, which he had all read at least two times each) mostly on comunism, drugs, revolution, government conspiracy, and almost the complete line of Penguin Classics. All of this shit was purchased with my sisters money, and she had no clue how excessive his spending was... Though Steve dressed like a hiker, he had about $20-30,000 worth of fine clothes which he bought but never wore.    Now my sister is living with her boyfriend in MD and they'll probably end up getting married. Steve, last we heard of him, was living in Thialand. He took his $50k in Baghdad money and figured that he could live on $200 a month in beautiful Thialand... He spent $7,000 on a new computer, had five suits hand tailored (he's a XXL, about 350lbs), and hired maids and poolhands as soon as he arrived. He bought two $200 pairs of sunglasses upon exiting his plane...Within a few weeks he managed to spend everything he had and got fired from the job he had there (if he really even had a job at all)....    and I've left major details out and wrote this like shit cause I'm tired and I'm not feeling creative tonight. Waky story though.      shit... Penn and Teller's "Bullshit" came on 5 minutes into writing that, so I lost all motivation. It shows.  NP: Strangefolk-Demo Disc... Gayest songs ever, but it's really good.
