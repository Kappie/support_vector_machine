Anywho, I don't know how long this will last, but here I go.  The name is Philip, location, Memphis, TN, I'm 16 years of age, no drivers license, a Senior in high school, have a 2nd degree black belt in Taekwondo.  Hobbies include anime, Star Wars, airsoft, RPGs (of all types),  acting and filming. You will learn more about, that is if you don't already know me, by reading what I post about my life here every few days. That is all for now, you'll have to wait for the juicy stuff.
