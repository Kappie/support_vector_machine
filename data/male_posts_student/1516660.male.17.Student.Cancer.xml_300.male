When I see Glenn hor, it reminds me of someone. HaHa. Whatever. Mother brought brakfast back, and after eating, I went online lor.  At 10+, I went down to Metro to take money from her to help her buy gifts. HaHa. I see the weather being almost raining, I hurriedly made my way down lor. HaHa. In the end, I stayed for an hour to chat with Wendy. HaHa. Chat Chat Chat.  I arrived home at 12+. After lunch, I went to play my game, then came online and went to watch TV/bath/eat.   Sigh. After all these are done, I came online again. A lot a lot of things happened. I don't wanna disclose, but after all these, I felt that life sucks. Within a short span on 2 hours, I experienced anger, fustration, annoyance, stupidity and guilt. I feel that life sucks after what happened. LIFE SUCKS.  Wanna know what I am doing now? I am singing songs out loud. Freak. Gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.
