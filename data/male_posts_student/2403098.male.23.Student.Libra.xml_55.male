I figured, hey, I'm an idiot, lets see if it really is idiot-proof, so I gave it a shot.  Below you will see just how much of a tourist I am when I'm out of town.    Seriously though, I posted some pictures of my last day in Chicago when I wandered around with a camera all over the city.  Nothing too thrilling, just various images of things in my future home and my hotel.  I'm a total nerd with things like that, I thought the hotel was cool so I was "that guy" taking pictures of the lobby.  I tried to do it in a hurry before anyone noticed me and before a loser-alarm went off.  The hotel was really cool.  It was the W hotel on Lakeshore overlooking Lake Michigan.  If you've never been to Chicago, Lake Michigan is not just a simple lake.  It is endless and is basically an ocean.  Full yachts, beaches, no other shore visible with the human eye.  The hotel itself was really cool.  It was very modern and retro at the same time.  The lobby had club music playing 24 hours a day, and at night it was a very club atmosphere.  The room itself was awesome as well.  I tried to get some pictures of that so that I could share.  If you click on the pictures, you get them in a new, bigger window, and you can see them with more detail!  I hope you enjoy.  I miss Chicago already.  Sorry there aren't any pictures of me standing in front of landmarks.. it's hard to take pictures of yourself.
