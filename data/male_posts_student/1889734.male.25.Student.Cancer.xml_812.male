CNN had a few stories, but all of them dated back to 2003, mostly about Hans Blix blasting the US for rushing to war.  However, on Fox, there were two stories that related to the Quarterly report in question.   urlLink Here  and  urlLink here .  Interesting.  It still doesn't explain why this isn't more prominent.  It goes back to my dissapointment in Bush for not getting the news out.  The loss of Karen Hughs has weighed heavy on the administration.
