Tomorrow I want to sit in on the anti-systemic movements class. I'll probably do some photocopying tomorrow as well. Laundry also needs to be done tomorrow.  So today Melissa and I went to get stuff for our turkey feast Friday night. We got most of the stuff at Walmart; however, Walmart was out of injectors. We tried looking for one at Giant and Target, which required a lot of walking. It also wasn't cool waiting in the cold for the bus.   I miss TV! I want to watch the OC!  ***
