Gotta love that stuff. I've had some REAL conversations with Greg and Spencer lately, and that helps my mood more. I hate that stupid little between-classes-chit-chat stuff. I'd rather talk about life anyday. Too bad the people I can do that with are limited to around four. Well anyways, the cast party was awesome. So much more fun then last years when I just left and didn't talk or anything. Now me and Greg can climb up the back porch and start freaking out when the lights come on! Pool was cool too, even though I beat you every game! mwhahaha. Better luck next time, and maybe we can stay later then 1am tonight. I told Kaz to bring DDR tonight, so if he does that will be sooooooooo cool! If Anna is there she plays too. And I think that would be a good cast party activity. Ummm getting bored now....Everyone did great though...Except whoever bumped the house lights! >.
