Well, today was soccer day... not as easy as i had hoped... but it went pretty well. We did a few drills: dribbling the ball around pilons, distance kick, accuracy kick, and then we played games. We basicly did the same thing again with all the groups, except the littlest group got to play find the person, where we hide one of them and they have to try to find him or her. They had lots of fun with that.  Today was my best performance at driving ever. My braking was top notch, and i looked when i backed out. I also did my first left hand turn today, out of the parking lot and onto the street... i kind of blew that one... i kept it left too long, and i almost ran the car onto the grass... its funny, i dreamed i would do that, and i did. I learned a lot from that though! Hopefully i'll do better next time!  On a completely unrelated note, i want to blog about how i am liking Onegai Teacher. I won't tell you what its about, if you want to know, go read a review at  urlLink Animenfo .  I downloaded Onegai Twins some time ago, and i enjoyed that a lot, it was sweet, and heatwarming, with a nice bit of romance in there... it had some elements i didn't like, but i won't mention those.  I liked it so much, i wanted to get the first part of the series, Onegai Teacher, and i did, last week. This week i've been devoting to watching it. It's a lot different from Onegai Twins, but i think i like it even better. It's really sweet in some places, and other places make you want to scream. I think that would be called dramatic irony... when you know somethings that the characters don't. Very fun stuff.  I also tried to get a demo of the game  urlLink Lineage II , but i was unsucessful. I found a place where i can download it, but it was going to take 30 hours, so i decided against it.  One more day of Vacation Bible School, pray for good weather!  Lates
