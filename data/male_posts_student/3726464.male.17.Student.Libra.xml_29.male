"bad mistakes coming back to haunt me" by claiming that i am sensitive before.. sometimes, i dun get your hints.. tell me.. i wna to know..i too am frustrated when i dun understand you.. can you understand that? haiz...  every part of me screams for you.. i love you.. i need you.. maybe in your eyes, you've already given me a chance and i have blown it.. but pls.. i need time to change.. izzit cos we're both under immense pressure? i told you before.. if need be, i will wait for you.. till your o levels are over.. till a levels are over.. i know that you're the one for me.. someone.. there is no reason.. it's a feeling.. you're special... maybe not to everyone... but to me, and maybe some other guys, you are... i was so heart broken when you say that you love me less... and you dun enjoy being with me.. i try so hard to give you the best.. but.. it's not enough.. why? cos in your mind you've already made up your mind that you wan to leave me? cos you've someone by your side already? kicking me away so that you can be with that someone? i will never know.. you talk to him over the phone.. i dun even call any other girls for idle chat.. but you do.. haiz.. i am crying as i write this... but if i never say, would you know? no matter how sensitive a person is, somethings cannot be seen.. but then again, how would i know if you do read this.. or if you're already forgotten about this blog that was create out of our love.............. haiz.. i love you esther.. always will.. always shall..
