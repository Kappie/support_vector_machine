I plan on taking more during lunch tomorrow.  I also took some shots at the brand new YMCA.  I haven't gotten those off my camera just yet, because I only have two USB ports and I got a new optical mouse today at OfficeMax.  That mouse, by the way, was only 20 bucks.  It's one of those nice Microsoft ones too.  I was happy about that.  I planned on using it in my web design and computer graphics classes instead of the apple hockey puck mouse for the G3s.  I'm liking it a lot though.  I'm thinking about just keeping it.  I use this computer more than in my classes anyways.  I had a lot of homework to do today.  I got it all done tonight before midnight.  I was happy about that.  I was lazy this afternoon and wasn't really thinking much about doing it.  I'm just glad I got it done right now.  It's pretty late right now, so I should go to bed!  Night.
