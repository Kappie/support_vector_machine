The way modern day sportstars are sending the record books tumbling (Michael Schumacher, Sachin Tendulkar, Matthew Hayden, Lance Armstrong to name a few), a record has become a feat destined to be erased from the annals of sport sooner or later. No sooner have we dealt with all the statistical interpretations of this 'r'-word, we force ourselves to possibly ponder over another banal argument. Is Player 'X' (or Team 'X') the  Greatest  ever? Or is Player 'A'  Greater  than Player 'B'? Commonplace remarks like these are being made and used so often, that no wonder, any arguments associated with it eventually become completely threadbare.  If you are someone who reads the online version of  urlLink The Times of India , you will understand what I am saying. Here comes a pathetic newspaper which (quite unfortunately) markets itself as the  World's #1 English Daily . True, the TOI is still the #1 newspaper, and calling it the World's #1 is certainly better than say, calling New York Yankees as one of the  World's top  baseball teams, if you know what I mean. But I am not entirely sure whether TOI is really the #1 "read" newspaper or simply the #1 "viewed" newspaper. To stretch this further, of late, I sincerely believe that TOI is synonymous to crappy journalism at its very best. Folks at TOI barely manage to do "sound" reporting once in a while, forget about finding a nice column or two once in a week on their webpages. All they are able to churn out is entertainment, and mostly celluloid trash relating to kissing scenes and hot gossip in bollywood. The fact that the stuff TOI sells is actually "sellable" is itself a tad unfortunate. If you compare TOI with the other distinguishable Indian daily -  urlLink The Indian Express , you'll perhaps get a better idea. Ofcourse, I have no plans to canvass for IE in the future, as I am not a big reader of IE either. But from whatever little I read and could make out, IE does seem to have a far better journalistic approach towards current affairs and general reporting. I suppose, gone are those days when the daily morning cup of chai deserved to be sipped only if you had the TOI pages spread in front of you.  I get the feeling that the only person who might not complain about TOI is our very own little master, cricketing genius - Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. The astounding amount of coverage and attention (in any "web-compatible" form you could think of) that the wonder boy from Mumbai gets from this daily, would probably put to shame even the British newspapers, tabloids and paparazzi when they report about their beloved Princess Diana. If the name "Sachin" literally becomes a religion in the years to come, I am quite sure TOI would have a major hand in doing that. The paper manages to shower endless praise on Tendlya; they keep elevating him to higher pedestals, if religion as a pedestal was not high enough (what a thought!), and then they don't waste much time in playing down his achievements or actions either; its like being hypocritical. Let it be anything, absolutely  anything  happening in world cricket, there  has  to be atleast one page dedicated to this God, irrespective of the fact that he has nothing to do with what happened. It irritates me, not because Sachin does not deserve encomiums, but the fact is that this God needs to be worshipped and left alone; he really does, he certainly deserves it more than he deserves never-ending eulogies and comparisons between him and the current/past cricketers. The media is prying all the time, waiting to pounce on every opportunity. One article talked about Steve Waugh's association with Udayan in Calcutta, a charitable organisation that houses children of leprosy afflicted parents, and then it talked about what Sachin did with his million bucks (rather what he  did not ), in comparion to Steve's charity work. If Sachin earns billions, why should not he have the right to use it for selfish motives? He serves not only Team India, but every citizen of India. It's simple math. If a billion people were to pay "a rupee" to Sachin for the indescribable joy that he gives them when he bats, wouldn't that amount to an income of a billion? Okay, this might be some warped theory of mine, but I think it makes sense (atleast to me). If Sachin makes the Sensex go berserk, and manages to directly affect the sentiments and emotions of billions in India, this seems fair and  logical  (if not exactly pragmatic) to me! Matthew Hayden was the epitome of murderous frenzy when he smashed 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth. Shouldn't Hayden take a bow for that? Not exactly, we don't care about that, the only thing we care is why doesn't apna Sachin score triple hundreds? Isn't it high time he scored real BIG? Even before 24 hours had passed by after Hayden's world record, one of the top TOI headlines read: "Is Sachin still the best?". Pray, why can't this chap ever get a break?  Why are we so preoccupied with labels like  The Greatest ? Call it venting my anger on TOI (and their fetish for Sachin), or call it being opinionated for no genuine reasons, I realize that many a times I am myself unable to resist similar temptations of comparing sportstars. People will say there is very little point in finding a reasonable and rational answer to finding  The One  great, amongst all. Different eras, different rules of the game, different opponents, different equipment renders, the argument gradually gets redundant. Although I am not as paranoid as TOI about indulging in these debates, I think there is an enticing aspect about drawing comparions, dissecting sportstars, (their achievements that is), and analysing them. Is Michael Schumacher the greatest driver ever? Is Tendulkar the greatest batsman? Or was it Bradman, Gavaskar, Waugh? Again, as rotten as these arguments get day by day, I would be the first one to admit that they are lip-smacking all the same. After returning from my Indy trip, I spent a week exchanging healthy emails with a friend of mine, on the greatness factor in F1 Racing; a topic that has been hotly discussed in the last couple of years since Schumacher and Ferrari began their dominance in F1, and more so after Schumacher won a record sixth title this year. Obviously, the heated discussions were on Schumacher and whether he is the greatest. I won't get into more details though, since if you happen to be the one who is aware of my writing capabilities, you would know that Blogger.com would have to increase their disk space in case I plan to publish a transcript of all the emails out here. The discussion was truly healthy though, and I guess the final outcome of the debate was pretty much a stalemate!  Personally speaking, I have a different perception of judging a player's  greatness . People have different criteria for judging the greatness of a player, criteria that they use to separate men from mere mortals in a sport. So let me put forth before you, my own reasoned commentary. Since this is already turning out to be a  BIG BLOG  that I've been writing and re-writing the last 3 weeks, I thought I might as well write my tuppence worth on some sporting greats. I believe that deciding Sachin's greatness is a bit tougher than someone like Schumacher, Armstrong, or Pete Sampras.  1. The 5-time Tour De France champion Lance Armstrong has probably the easiest of cases. This man bounced back from the brink of death after being diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that spread into his lungs and brain, but still went on to win the intensely grueling bicycle race on this planet, not once, not twice, but five times in a row (99-03). A feat perhaps unmatched in any other sport. If people still fail to consider him as the greatest, then I am sorry to say, but they are either deaf, dumb or blind or they have a severe Anti-American xenophobia of some sorts.   2. With Schumacher its not as easy, but I guess its not as hard as determining Sachin's case. Schumi too, has every record in the bag, but I always felt statistics can be misleading. I rate Schumi as the greatest driver ever, not because of his record breaking feats and championship wins, but because he is a tremendous driver even otherwise. The man who brought Benetton and Ferrari to winning ways when they were almost down in the dumps speaks volumes of his skills. This man doesn't need a good car like most other drivers do. Even Minardi's Paul Stoddart was impressed after watching him in one of his own two-seater cars, with Schumi behind the wheel. Stoddart described Schumi's driving as truly exceptional after the German posted lap times within a second of their normal single-seater F1 cars. The Benetton team (now re-tagged as Renault) never enjoyed success before or after Schumi's four-year spell with them from 1991-5 before he moved on to join a struggling Ferrari outfit. The rest, is history. Under Schumacher, Ferrari dominated like no other racing team, ever. But then Schumacher has been a far too controversial figure than Armstrong, and they say he didn't have stiff competition over the last few years, and that he got lucky on most occasions (the last two arguments being as ridiculous as they can get). What would have happened if he was in a lesser car, or if any one driver amongst Hill, Villenueve, Hakkinen, Coulthard, Montoya, and Raikkonen were to be driving for Ferrari, as Schumi's teammate? Interesting questions, for which nobody has answers, which is why his greatness will always be questioned.  3. I have a controversial opinion about Pistol Pete. To me, he is  not  the greatest tennis player. He has also been described as the most invincible player ever, but I saw him being invincible only on the hallowed grass of Wimbledon. He was never invincible on any other surface, although he did manage to give a  perception  of invincibility. I am not sure which player I would rate as the greatest all-round player in tennis; but the name of Andre Agassi comes to my mind instantly. I came up with my own theory (again), to compare Sampras and Agassi. Suppose that Wimbledon was to have a surface like clay instead of grass. Considering Sampras' poor record on clay, would he be even anywhere close to being called as the greatest? The chances of him winning on Wimbledon clay would be close to nil. Since Agassi won all grandslams - be it clay, grass, hard-court, rebound-ace, cement, and what not, even if you change Wimbledon to clay or a French Open to a grass surface, Agassi's chances of winning won't lessen, unlike Sampras. My notion of a great tennis player is someone who can play equally well everywhere. After watching Agassi's tennis, he could even play on glass! Having said that, I have no intentions whatsoever of downplaying Pete's achievements.  4. Sachin's case is tough. But for me, he will always remain as the  greatest . A few years ago, when Sachin was in the most pristine form of his batting career, they started comparing him with Sir Don, notably after Bradman himself showered accolades on his batsmanship. Sachin without doubt, will break every record in cricket (are there many more left except for Hayden's test record and Anwar's one day record?). The biggest road-block for Sachin on the way to becoming the greatest is the number of matches he has won for India single-handedly, compared to Waugh. In a team sport like cricket, this statistic is a benchmark for purists to comment on greatness. Sachin would never win as many matches for India as Waugh did for Australia; in fact the way Rahul The Wall Dravid is going these days, he stands a better chance of scoring BIG for the country. But I never use this criteria for judging his greatness. On any given day, Sachin is head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to simply "batting". Alas, if only he could use it to win more matches. Its my perception, that nobody comes even close to the repertoire of shots this man has. The difference is that someone like Steve Waugh has fewer shots but still goes on to win matches. And although that is great in itself, I see Sachin with a completely different view. When Sachin plays his trademark straight drive with the full face of his willow towards the umpire, it wouldn't be a farce to say that this man makes my day; a fact equally true with most of his other shots. There is unfathomable joy when I watch him bat - be it destroying the opposition or playing defensive; even the way he braces himself for the next ball, the way he holds his 4-pound willow and takes guard. There is artistry, a magical wizardry to his batting. The mere sight of Sachin stepping down the wicket, or going on the backfoot or hooking or pulling or cutting or driving or simply tapping the ball, is the most beautiful thing to watch on a cricket ground. No other batsman gives the same amount of cricketing pleasure. Those who did not watch Sachin's exploits at Sharjah against Australia in 1996 in the final two matches, should consider themselves as not having lived a better life. Those including me who saw him that day, were priviledged to watch something out of the ordinary unfold from the depths of heaven and descend on mother earth as a cricket innings that will never be forgotten till I breathe my last. (Call it a coincidence or whatever, I clearly recall a desert hurricane during one of those matches causing the match to stop for a while. Sachin almost symbolized that hurricane, whoa!). And then we experienced another slice of that similar heaven when Sachin demolished Shoaib Akhtar and Pakistan in the 2003 world cup match, as well as some of the other teams in the WC matches. Furious, incessant sledging was going on during the Pakistan game. The pandemonium this guy created when he blasted the Pakis with majestic ease will be etched forever in memory. The match proved a canter, and Akhtar had to eat his own four letter words. It seems Sachin could not sleep well for 13 days before the game vs. Pakistan. How could one forget the leg-side six (flick) off Andy Caddick against England? Poor old Caddick. I would not even dream of becoming a bowler if I have to face this little man. Sachin has to his credit a lot of under-rated test match centuries. Centuries which I have seen on tv, and for which I would have given more money than watching a double or a triple century from Lara or Hayden or Richards. Remember his 110 at Perth (1992?) in Australia as a 20 year old kid? The fastest pitch on this planet, against the Aussie battering ram of Merv Hughes and Craig McDermott? His 169 in South Africa when Allan Donald and Co. were throwing perfume balls (with Azhar at the other end)? (Note: "Perfume balls" was a phrase used for the WestIndies in the Michael Holding and Joel Garner era, when the Windies' bowlers ruled cricket. They bowled at lightning fast speeds with an akward length and line. The balls whizzed past so close to the nose of the batsman, that he could "smell" the ball.) And then the mockery he made of Warney when the Aussies toured in 1997, dancing down the wicket outside the leg stump and employing extraordinary tactics on dusty tracks to negate the huge spin and whack the greatest turner of the ball out of the grounds, and moreover, to add salt to wound, leaving him with nothing but nightmares of every shot he played! Some of his other test hundreds like his first century at Old Trafford against England and his 136 against Pakistan at Chennai (pity we lost him at the end thereby losing the test), and his ton at Melbourne in 1999 against McGrath, Lee, Fleming and Warne will also remain memorable. Not many centuries have produced a result in India's favor, and therein lies the unfortunate statistic! Didn't I say before, statistics could be misleading? SO true with someone like Sachin. Bradman might have played on worse, uncovered pitches in his days, but did he play 10 different teams at 50 different venues all year round, with the pressure of a billion people against him? I have had a first-hand experience of watching an India-Sri Lanka match at the Wankhede stadium (Independence cup), and believe me, it takes much more than guts and resolve and determination to play and perform well in front of a raging 50K capacity crowd. . . . Sachin Tendulkar, thanks a zillion. I don't care whether you win matches for India, whether you score a triple ton or not. My life is certainly better because of you. Thank you for opting to play cricket and for the  to-hell-with-college  approach, and thanks to your parents to have not objected. Thank you for all the honors of seeing you bat all these years.
