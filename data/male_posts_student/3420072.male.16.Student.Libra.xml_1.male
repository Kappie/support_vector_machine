I love the show red dwarf and futurama and very mad that futurama got cancelled.  these things happen throughout life new shows come and go then there are the shows that you hate that just wont get off the air. But hey I cant complain I'm glad some shows are on.  life can be so f*cked up. As I have a lot of influence in my own life I can easily say that I influence my self in what I want to write. For me metal music is so relaxing. I don't know why its just when I hear it I can lose myself in the music.  but who knows what can influence you through out your life it can be all the big things or it could be the small things like you notice something has changed just the slightest like someone has changed the style of their hair or something small like that.  life changes sometimes for the better sometimes not. Its always hard to make new friends when you absolutely know no one especially when your seen as a bit of a weirdo. Life can be shit.  I've never thought of myself as much or a writer cause I always start somewhere and end in a completely different place from once I started. I find it strange to writer. I think where I first started writing was when I was in year five and for some reason I found it necessary to turn the never ending story in to a story slightly change but in my own way now I have no idea why I did this but I did and just think of it as expressing something that I wanted to do.  so who knows what could happen to me.   I always find it difficult to get my thoughts especially after school I think that it really drains me of energy I'm glad that at the moment I have 2 weeks off school so it will also allow me to write up here what ever I want.  writing i think can be some of the most difficult thibgs to doo you just never know what you can write about.
