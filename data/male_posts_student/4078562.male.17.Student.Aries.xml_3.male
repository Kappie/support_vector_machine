But theres no motivation for them to have there own country really so i guess it wouldnt work. Or what if America joined the European Union, although that would never happen under Bush...maybe kerry. Has anyone ever realized how close alazka is to seattle? its really not that far but you think alaska and you think wow, thats far away, but really its like (looks at map) closer than salt lake city. And what up with athens? theyve sold like under  urlLink half of their total tickets . And they dont have security...its gonna be like rainbow 6, terrorists will try to kill everyone but a politically correct team of 6+ multi-ethnic people will save the day! w00t!  JBus
