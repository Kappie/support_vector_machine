In case you're wondering, the first three numbers to the left of the classes are the course number, and the number to the right of the dash is the section number. Tell me if you match any set of numbers.  031-1 A.M. Swim 101-4 Honors English 10 B-Block 133-1 Myth, Folk Tale  SF C-Block 2nd Semester 178-1 Eng: TV Production C-Block 1st Semester 203-2 Honors French 3 D-Block 420-2 Honors Wrld Hist 1815 E-Block 472-1 Mock Trials 502-3 Honors Math 2 A-Block 602-4 Honors Chemistry Lab G-Block 695-26 Homeroom  So far, I know that Jonny's in my math class and Loren's in my history class.  I have to go to school on Wednesday because I don't have a gym class second semester and I'm not signed up for Model UN as a class.  Readers, let me know if you want to do anything with me; the summer's a-waning.
