After she returned which was about a week ago she got really sick and we couldnt see it until today. So I have finally seen it and .... well it was really wierd. Usually I dont like giving the story away but I'm going to anyways. So if you dont want to know the whole story dont read past the **** further down the blog.  The Village is about .... well a village based in 1870-80's Pennsilvania. This small village that is located inside of a valley is surrounded by a forest. For those who do not already know this forest is the home for a group of terrible monsters. The Elders of this village moved into this place to escape the outside towns where they say horrible things happen. All of the Elders tell stories of how many people are killed in the outer towns and that the people who live there are savages that ave no moral value. When the Elders moved to the valley to escape the outside world they made a treaty with the monsters that lived in the forest. They promised the monsters that the villagers would not go into the woods as long as the monsters did not enter the village. The villagers were also not allowed to wear or have the colour red in thier village. Because this was a forbidden colour and the monsters or those we can not name will attack if they see this colour. So anyway in the begining of the movie a little child dies and one of the villagers ask to leave the village in order to get medicine so no one else will die like the little boy. He is denied twice so one day he decides to walk several feat in and one of the monsters see him so he quickly goes back to the village. That night the mosters enter the village and leave signs on all of the doors warnig the people not to enter the woods.  After this part you might not want to read if you have not already seen the movie and want to see it.   ****  So another night they are holding a wedding and the mosters return to the village again but this time they kill the villagers live stock and then they skin them and leave them at different places in side of the village. All of the villagers are scared except for one namedLucius Hunt who falls in love with this blind girl named Ivy Walker. So they anounce their engagement which seriously angers another villager named Noah Percy (who i believe has terets syndrome because he always shakes). So in anger Noah stabbs Lucius and the rest of the villagers find out. So they punish Noah by locking him in an empty room. So Ivy ass the her father who is the head elder if she can go to one of the outer town to get medicine. He allows her to leave but first he has to show her something. What you are about to read will seriously ruin the movie for everyone so this is your last chance to stop reading.    They go to this cabin which is off limits to the villagers and inside are what the audience believes at this point will be one of the monster and they are right. But not exactlyit is only a costume of a monster. Right know if you havnt seen it you are scratching your head saying what the heck. You see the Elders who had lived in the outside world wanted to leave so badly that they made up this story about monsters so that the villagers would not leave the village and venture into the world beyond the forest.  Ivy's dad talks to the elders and at first they are reluctant to allow her to go but eventually let Ivy leave. So Ivy leaves withe two escorts but one chickens out at the edge of the forest and the other leave several minutes in. In the woods she is attacked by one of the monsters.... right now your thinking wait a minute I thought the mosters were elders and the elders allowed her to leave. Well your right this monster is the retarded Noah who found a costume under the floor boards in the empty room and then he escaped. So Noah fools around and chases her she eventually tricks him to fall into a pit and Noah dies. Remember Ivy is blind so eventually she reaches this road she has to get to and then she reaches the wall she must climb. As soon as she gets over she is met by a man in a jeep. Yes I said a jeep, and the man is nice unlike what the elders have said. This is because the elders were all part of a support group for people who's family members had been killed by acts of violence. So the delusional elders fled. Anyways this man in the jeep turns out to be a park ranger in charge of a wildlife reservation but Ivy cant tell because she is blind. The year is closer to 2004 then 1870 and the village is inside of an animal reservation that is why the elders dont want the outsiders to know of thier town. So Ivy eventually get some medicine and brings it to Luscious. THE END!  So here is a wrap up the elders all had one .... well maybe two things in common they had all lived through deaths in thier families caused by extreme violence and they were really crazy. So in their delusions they escaped to an animal reservation to live. Then they told thier children the outside world was evil and that thier were monsters in the forest. So if that isnt clear enough I can explain more just email me at  templar_40k@hotmail.com      Anyways I thought this movie had the biggest twist in it from any movie I had ever seen and that.... well it was interesting so I give it an 8.5/10. It is enjoyable, just crazy and it really makes you review the story over and over again.  Oh yah and  urlLink Adrien Brody  does a really good job as  Noah.  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix  the evil emporer from Gladiator does a good job as Lucious (which is actually his nephews name in gladiator) and  urlLink Bryce Dallas Howard  who is Ron Howards (Ron Howard is a famous director for those who do not know) daughter does a really good job in her firstrole as the blind Ivy.  The End  Lates,  Smog
