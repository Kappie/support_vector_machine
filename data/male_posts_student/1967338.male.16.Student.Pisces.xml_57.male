I hope we beat LN, because I hope that we will beat every band. To Jonah: Glad Claire coming won't be too awkward for you. You know what would be fun? One day where the United States was just a massive anarchy. Would be interesting to see how things would play out. I shall see you all thursday at six.  SQEE!
