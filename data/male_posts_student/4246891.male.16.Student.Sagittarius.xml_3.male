As I walk by the path where my feet involuntarily follow, I was amazed to find that I can brightly see everything in my path even if the place was really dark. I don’t know where I was. The only thing I knew is that there is something to be done and that it should be done, before I leave the forest. And so, I continued walking not knowing what lied ahead of me.  I heard a wolf howling, shivering my whole body until I had goose bumps. I stopped walking and realized that I was standing by a tree – a giant tree that looks a hundred years old. From within, I felt an invisible presence in the place. I sensed something mysterious about where I was but I don’t know. I really don’t know.  Then suddenly, to my astonishment, I heard a very soft voice creeping in my ear saying something that I could not understand. I started to feel nervous so I decided to walk away and sing my favorite jingle. As I walk to the place that even I don’t know, I looked back to where I was. I saw a man, all dressed in long white clothing and almost looked like me but I knew it was not myself, resting by a tree. The only thing I could not accept is that there is still someone behind him – another person I could not describe. His image was unclear to me. He looked as if he was a blurred picture standing behind the man. Then, I continued to the darkness ahead.  As I continued walking, I went deep into the forest. I felt pain in my feet, arms and legs as I walk to the path because the way was rough and thorny. I struggled and endured the journey to continue on to where I need to go even if it is uncertain. With the physical pain I was experiencing, I suddenly felt pain deep in my heart. I realized that it was hard to continue on. It seemed that I was regretting – regretting about the decision of moving on instead of staying under the tree and rest there forever but……. I must go on. I chose and all I have to do now is to make a stand.  I realized that I was already walking to a beautiful house. Yes, it looked like one of my dream houses and it stood in front of me – inside this forest. I could not believe it! I wanted to get in but as I saw the note on the front door, I started to think twice. The note says: “Those who dare enter this house will experience happiness for eternity – the peace and joy of solitude. But before he decide, it must be known that he will have to leave all that is behind including his memory – all that is there in his mind – everything!”  After a minute or two, I decided not to.  I declined to that opportunity of a lifetime. Why? It is because I wanted to cherish all the things that had happened to me, even the bad ones. I cherished them all. It really feels good to recall memories especially the changes that occurred in those years.  I will never forget all of them for without them, I could not get here – I could not see the future that lies beyond the path I have chosen – I could not be what I am now. And so, I continued…  After 20 years of stay in this forest, I am glad that it became very fruitful because with it, I found myself. It taught me to decide, to make a stand against all odds, to rebuild myself and to construct my foundation, to where my future stands. Even now that I am still wandering through this forest of uncertainty, I am pretty certain that my life will go on – and as I go through the life I chose, I will always carry the decisions I had made and the foundation of my future.
