Well, we went out earlier than I thought we would; it was about two and Lennie told me that Symmone was going to pick us up soon.  Well, I just woke up a few hours before so my hair was still plastered to my head!  Well, that must have been the fastest I've ever had to get ready, which is ironic, because I really had a half an hour.  But ah well, there's no use dwelling on it.  Well, we just visited a few shops at Polo Park, then sat and talked on a bench, and then in the car.  Mostly about sex, not in a sick way, but in a semi-serious fashion.  Afterwards we went to eat, and I had pho (a Vietnamese beef noodle soup), it was great, and I got better at the chopsticks *thumbs up*.  Well, afterwards, we went to my house and just talked mostly, and Symmone actually watched his first episode of 'What Not to Wear', I feel like a proud parent *laughs*.  Afterwards Lennie and Maria talked to each other about something I felt was pretty serious, and now I feel worried.  Let's hope that my worries are unfounded.
