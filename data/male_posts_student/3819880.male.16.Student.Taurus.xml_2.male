I saw  Catwoman  with Carolyn.  The plot was a piece of shit, but the leather costume looked very very good on Halle Berry so it sorta made up for it.  Of course, you've got to wonder why on earth she would decide to make such a crappy movie...    After watching the movie, Carolyn and I stood outside of Northbrook Court calling people and generally being bored.  We wound up going to Blockbuster and rented  Scream 2 , which we watched at her house and caused me to arrive home a wee bit past curfew.      Umm...I don't really have anything to say, so I'm going to end this entry.  Good night everyond.    - Brian
