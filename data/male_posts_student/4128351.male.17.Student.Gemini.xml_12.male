I stayed up last night thinking about you, I missed you being in my arms.        This morning I woke up at like 1 PM.  I know, I suck really bad.  I'm so sorry.  I took a shower and then Vickers and I went to Gino's, his grandma's, and then the prestigious Mason County Fair.  We stayed a little while and then went home.  I got in my car and drove to Jami's.        I suck.      Right now, I'm talking to Nathan on AIM, he's cool as hell.  It'd be alot easier if fucking Beth would stop IMing me... I never even reply, why does she still do it?  I don't know anymore.      I gave Roush my bootlegged copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, complete with a slam and a mom joke.  He loves it.  I can't wait for him to get his camera developed, he's gonna cry.  Haha, I'm so stupid.      I know I'm just rambling on about nothing, I really have no life outside of my love.  When Brice gets done eating his fries we're going to go watch the episodes of Seinfeld he just burnt to DVD.        Tomorrow I'm going to go to church and then Jamin's cookout.  That reminds me, I have to burn Jamin's CD's for him.  Hmm... I'll do that now.      Well, folks, I'm going to run.  If you want something else to read, check out my baby Tuesday's blog, she finally updated it.  ;)      I'm out of here children, keep it cool.  I love you, goodnight.
