I've decidedto buy a camera, from my video camera it's gotten me into photography quite alot and I've decided to get a good one, I've seen the one I wan't and I've just gotta get the money together now (difficult when you don't have a job).   I havent been upto much this holiday really. I ordered from iron on transfer paper to make some t-shirts or something, I'm probably gonna make a TD one since I've only even seen two to buy and they are crummy.   Found out about a show the spree might be doing with thir October tour, Hannah who I met briefly at the Shepherds Bush show owns an estate and she's booked them in to play in a tiny old church there, fits about 100 people she said and us board members will be on the guest list, I'm going to see if I can organise a photo pass for then so I can get in and take photographs which should be good because I'm putting together a portfolio to help me get a job in that sort of area.   I've decided in my year out I might take on a photography/graphic design course for AS at the local college, I'd have to organise it soon though, or maybe just a beginners course or something and go onto to do it at university...I haven't decided yet.
