Way before that though Tyke woke up to his alarm at 10:30 and then realized he didn't want to get up so he just went back to sleep and got up at about 12:20. Then he DLed some music and listened to it and then he worked out and did crunches and worked up a sweat. So he decided to cool down by playing the piano. The only song he really plays right now is Variations on the Canon. Pachelbel's Canon or Canon in D would be other names for the song. But it's just real quality classical music that Tyke loves. However, it isn't a very easy song to play. In fact Tyke can only play like the first sheet of the entire sheet music. And even that he doesn't play it 100% correctly. He doesn't play all the chords really. But he's getting good at actually playing what he can for now. When Tyke went out to get his mail he saw his checks finally came. Of course there was a mistake in them though. The city of Sammamish is spelled Sammanish. The checks still got to him, mainly cuz the zip code was still correct but his mom thinks that he still should get the error corrected. Tyke doesn't want to have to wait again but maybe he should. He got 150 checks and he certainly won't use those up for at least a year. How often will Tyke really write checks? Not that often. Tyke had fajitas for dinner tonight. His chewing continues to improve but it still isn't back to normal. He can eat pretty much anything he wants though which is a great improvement over his past diet which consisted entirely of mushy food. Tyke did have a Wild Berry Ensure this morning though. He wanted chocolate but his mom got wild berry. Lo and behold, it tasted like chocolate anyway. So that was kinda weird but it tasted good so Tyke didn't care. Time passed though and Tyke went out with the guys...again. Macaroon got back in town so he joined the bowling brigade. Tyke, Kinker, Maniak, Macaroon, K-caj. Tyke struggled the first game. The second game he got better but still not very good. The second game for Kinker though...that was a good game. He ended up 3 short of 200 but still put in a respectable 197. Can't beat Tyke's record of  205  but it certainly upped Kinker's old record of  165 . Italics...neat.  urlLink http://www.tykeandskippy.blogspot.com  That's neat too. Tyke's fourth game ended up being pretty quality. He got tired during it but still managed to knock down 187 of those little white bastards. He got 4 strikes in a row too which is always nice. Nothing like a turkey+1. Then Tyke drove Kinker and Macaroon to JIB for caramel shakes and onward to the Macaroon house where they all went home. Friday could be a boring day. Maybe a boring night too. Tyke is hoping that he can hang out with a certain someone but most likely it won't happen. Always a chance.
