I use the word "game" very loosely- it is a series of clues that leads you to the next page...  In the source of the first page "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here" can be found near the bottom... this is part of the inscription on the gates of hell.  And when you rollover the image that links to the next page, text reads "run now".   Comment if you need help, or have gotten past the truck page.. thats as far as I got.
