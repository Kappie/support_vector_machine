And things turned out cool and we managed to get over the "rumours" thingy.. She heard it from Amanda which heard from Marcus.. *sIgHzZ*.. What is going on man... But above all.. I want to be with Jenni.. No matter what.. Rumours.. Gossips.. WtF*! I don't care.. Hahaha! By the way.. Ya'll heard the D-12 Song - How Come - ? I can rap man... Rap the song.. How cool is that?? Hahaha!! Cool.. Cool.. Well.. That's for now.. All I wanna know is that I wanna be with Jenni.. No matter what.. Love ya sweetie!
