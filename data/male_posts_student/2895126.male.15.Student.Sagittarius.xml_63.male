I have to try (and ultimately fail, even with the help of Graham, Nolan, and Emily) to control 30, screaming, running, annoying, 3 to 6 year olds.  It's not torture for the entire two hours i do it, because they're only one group, but GOOD LORD, are they the WORST.  One kid, while attempting to jump a 3-foot tall iron fence (with dull spikes every three inches) got snagged and ended up with his head on the ground and his legs in the air and a hole in his pants. All the more fun with the passers-by who had to help him up.   This kind of thing happened the entire 15-minute torture session we were subjected to. Luckily, they're calling in two more helpers, augmenting our force to a strong six during recess.  And so we brace ourselves for battle.
