Anyways, we watched Kill Bill, Vol. 1, which neither of us had seen at that point. What a great movie!! Like, you can't even get grossed out by the violence because it is so over the top, you sorta know that it's not real. Uma was great, I was a big fan of Lucy Liu, and my favorite breakout character is, of course GoGo. She crazy.  After that, though, Tim coaxed me into watching CSPAN Senate debates on the Federal Marriage Amendment. I saw Jim Talent, Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. I originally wanted to leave before Orrin Hatch got on, but it was kinda entertaining.  Sen. Hatch had all these fancy pictures and graphs, showing how many states had same-sex married couples living in them as opposed to 1996. It looked like all those epidemiological maps of like, syphilis outbreaks, or West Nile virus.  He went on to say some pretty incredible things.   Example 1:  "[same-sex marriage] is the most important issue facing our country right now."  Really. Then tell George Bush to stop fighting with Al Qaeda, since this fundamental issue is not one our respective nations seem to disagree on. Or did I miss something? Like, are the Republicans fueling this war on terror/brown people because Abdul Rauf Nassib and Sayyed Imam Sherif are destroying the fabric of our nation by giving each other secret reach-arounds in the deserts of West Yemen?  Example 2:   This is the most important debate in our nation's history.   (In my best Tim Stewart-Winter voice) Interesting. Thank goodness no one halted the Constitutional Convention to find out why Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr were *really* mad at each other.  Example 3:  If you let a same-sex couple, married in Massachusetts, move to South Dakota, recognizing that marriage will violate the will of the people in South Dakota, thus destroying states' rights.   First of all, um, hello? Why are you moving from Massachusetts to South Dakota? You deserve to have your marriage dissolved if you do stupid shit like that.  Secondly, there are plenty of "traditional" marriages that violate the will of the people. Some weddings that require referenda:  Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morrisette. They're engaged...did you know that? Anyways, their marriage would violate my will to fantasize about Ryan as my personal naked love slave. REJECTED.  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. You know those kids are gonna turn out either really hot, or really ugly. No one needs to stick around to find out. DISSOLVED.  Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson. Talk about destroying the fabric of our nation...DISSOLVED.  Jennifer Lopez and anybody... this chick obviously doesn't know what she's doing. She needs pre-approval before she gets married, always. YOU ARE NOT APPROVED.  People who listen to the will of the public:  Liza Minelli and David Gest. Good job. 'Cause that was just creepy.  Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. Good job. 'Cause that was just creepy.  Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Thank goodness someone is finally paying attention to my needs to fantasize about Jude Law as  my  husband. That's democracy at work.
