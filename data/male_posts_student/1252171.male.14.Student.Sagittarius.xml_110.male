They're actually based off the characters of the Sonic the Hedgehog universe. Here is a description of Sa2b:  Species: Hedgehog Gender: Male Tail: purple, Nightcrawler-ish Eyes: yellow Shirt: White, plus leather jacket Pants: jeans Shoes: orange, brown toe, brown heel, brown stripe across middle Hair: green, going up in a "V" shape Skin: yellow Gloves: Double-fold with slits at knuckles  And next time I'll tell you about when Sa2b and Noire first met. -Sane Intolerant-
