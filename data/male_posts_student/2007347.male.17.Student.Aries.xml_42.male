Somewhere or other,  Every now and again, my mother springs on us chocolate and the citizens rejoice,  We practically get the stuff about once a month, sometimes a lot sometimes very  Little. It just makes your day.  The last time (a Friday) I was on MSN and, of course, Kate was too. I got 2  Pieces of white chocolate, so I asked her if she wanted it, which she did, of  Course. So I saved it for her until Monday when I saw her again.  This time (Monday) I got a single piece of brown milk chocolate  asked her if  She wanted it.  {Let me tell you something about Kate, she can't have caffeine, her hearts too weak to cope. } She declined, of course, and I ate it, of course, it just happened to be that  coffee chocolate, Kate loves coffee (probably because she can't have it.) I could  of not said anything after that but I decided to complain the chocolate was that  really sour black chocolate, and didn't taste nice at all, and then blamed her for  not taking it and leaving me to eat such a horrid chocolate. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
