And hope she will recieved it too. Hm.... When Robin ask me regarding me being his 2 /C of Outreach, he sounded so much like a salesman. But I agreed, not bcoz of personal pride and glory. But becoz this is a chance for me to serve and glorify Him(Above). Hope that I will do a good job so as to bring more pple to him and that i wont disappoint Him. But even if I screw up, I believe he will still be there for me. So well, I'll see how it goes. So well, I stop here then!!!
