More and more, America is divided along the lines of the electoral  urlLink map  of the 2000 election.  Each side even has their own movie now.   The link I lost pointed to a distribution of where Michael Moore's F911 is making the most money, and it lines up with the Blue regions on the electoral map. Similar data was displayed for The Passion of the Christ, and of course, it lined up with the Red regions.   What to make of this polarization? Obviously there are whole books worth of conjecture about why this is so. My concern is in the increasing divergence of our perception of reality, as I had posted about last week. A typical person in the Blue region believes that Bush is dishonest, Iraq is a failure, and the best course of action is to figure out how to get the world to love us. And that's just on foreign policy. Domestically, we have the old Big Government solutions of the 40s coupled with a fundamental distrust of the market and a need for government oversight to assure the prosperity of all.   A typical person in the Red region believes the Iraqi war was more than justified, and our standing in the world isn't quite as important as our resolve to confront those that means us harm. Domestically, they general distrust the government, and would like to see a reduction in government size at various levels.   We both can't be right.   I'm young and relatively blind to the more recent trends of political history when it comes to personal experience. I can go back and read accounts of the last fifty years of politics, and I can see that many of the fundamental questions have not been resolved. Nor are they likely to be solved anytime soon, at least in a manner that forces one side to abandon their ideas. What concerns me is the inability of either side to have an honest debate. There's has always been distortion and mudslinging, but at least there seemed to be honest disagreement about what to do regarding issues, rather then the default assumption that the other side is either evil, stupid, or both. We're becoming two Americas, and not in the way that John Edwards means in his stump speech.   I'm a Red state voter. I am conservative, because I believe conservatism is a good thing, and is the correct way to govern a large collection of people. I believe in our response to Terrorism, and as a matter of fact, I think we should go even farther with our application of force. These perceptions, given the facts at hand, seem the most reasonable to me. I can only imagine abandoning them if some unimaginable evidence surfaced that we're doing the wrong thing, and note the word 'unimaginable'. So I find myself entrenched in a position I can't imagine leaving, yet I look at the other side in the mirror image world and wonder 'why can't they wake up?'. I'm sure they say the same thing about me.   I can't abandon my beliefs. I can't move to the mushy middle and try to pretend that both sides have merit when I see so very little on the other side of the fence that is worth defending. I can't be one of these so called high minded moderates who seem to enjoy not having any beliefs in anything, unless it is a belief in relativism. If two people are arguing about whether or not a house is on fire, it isn't 'principled' to say that 'the house could be on fire, but maybe it isn't'. So I can't embrace the middle, and the Left is the opposite of everything I believe.   What do I do?   I remain a Red Stater. And I'll continue to look at the other side like they are from another planet, so long as they refuse to embrace the bulk of evidence that they are wrong. I imagine they will pretty much do the same. Where do we go from here?   Is  urlLink secession  a bad thing?
