It had 50 multiple choice questions, a thematice essay, a few document based questions, and top it off with a DBQ essay. It took me the full 3 hours to complete it. The good news is.....it was easy as pie. Yup. Deffinetly one of the easiest tests I have ever taken. It was even eaiser than my math final which I know I bombed. So far no phone call which means I passed. Lets hope it never comes.
