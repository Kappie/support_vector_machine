Friday, stayed home, watched movies, to bed early. Saturday....up early, puttered around the house, haircut(which looks fab, also the beard is gone,replaced by a tiny(J, i did make it smaller), tragically hip goatee and soul patch. Went with J. and A. and basically ended up spending the day with them. The T-rock, then just hanging out on my porch, drinking heavilly and chatting  about music and life etc, which was great, but the drinking was a little much. Then to Lyles to meek K. and the Slavic Princess and other grad students on the fringe of the U. but then run home, lots of horking, unpleasant, and to bed, where i procede to sleep for two hours, and then wake up unable to sleep any more, I am supposed to be at the Moms' by 10:30, finally get back to sleep at around nine, wake up two more hours later. Desperately try and reach a hold of someone, flirt with J.C. on the phone( I have no clue, but he is seriouslly mr. mixed signals) coffee with the Slavic Princess, realize i am not happy with the prospect of teaching history, being caught up in academic squabbling and red tape and politics or any other aspect of life in academia. try not to freak out as now have no future to look forward to. home and watch the hallmark channel while knitting and eating an entire camembert...mmmmm. sleep by 11:00, up this am at 8:30. This has been a reeactment in two days of my past month or so....first i sit at home and hide, chaste, pure, and silent as a monk full of plans for self-discipline, personal growth etc. The weight falls off, along with my sanity and soon i am climbing the walls in disgust at my own inner pollyanna. Then i end up going out every night, spending the grocery money in bars, smoking my self hoarse, being bitter and sarcastic and unnecesarily cruel to those who don't deserve it and end up sick and apalled at how caustic i can be. No middle ground. nothing. One extreme or the other.  What can i do to colm this down? Anyone?
