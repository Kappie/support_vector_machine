I easily passed that, but I am still studying just to make sure I look real good :). I am either going to be an Infantryman or some type of computer job. Most likely an Infantryman. This gives me an opportunity to pocket 30k a year, and have a chance to go to college with it being paid for, not out of that 30k. So money wont be a problem either, since I will also be getting paid about 500 a month along with a yearly pay and so forth. *This is 2 year service pay, at minimum!*       I am very excited about this opportunity, I have been wanting to do this since I was a kid. By doing this I can also finally prove myself to my parents. I suggest this to anyone who isn't sure what they want to do, or are even just thinking about it. It as an amazing opportunity that not enough people take advantage of.  *Amazing full coverage health insurance and other great deals also. You are all missing out*
