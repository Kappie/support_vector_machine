Really kind of a shocking amount, considering how little time I actually had to devote to it and two other intertwined factors: the density of the material and the chaos around me during the time I was reading it.  Nonetheless, I've followed young Theodore through his Harvard years and up to his engagement to Alice Lee.  Great stuff... he's really fascinating.  I'm looking very forward to the next 650 pages in this volume and the 800 that await me in  Theodore Rex .  Muahahaha.  Can't figure out what's wrong in my head right now.  Troubling.  Stop affecting me, you.  Jess is home!  Which means... I dunno... I suppose it means we'll get a chance to hang out soon.  Hope so.  It's been... well... too long... in actual months it's roughly 6?  *counts in head "June to July, July to August, August to September, September to Oct... yeah.  6"*  Gotta get up in waaaaayyyyy too few hours.  But it's going to be a fun day.  I'll cope :)  Talk to you all later.  Or some of you, anyway, as I have no idea who reads this thing.
