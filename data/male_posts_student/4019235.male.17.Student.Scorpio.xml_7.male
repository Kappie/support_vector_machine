His list is long and impressive:     Richard Nixon                   Ronald Reagan                   John Wayne                   All the major defense contractors                    Disneyland                    The John Birch Society                   Congressman Bob Dornan                   The anti-immigrant movement                   Prop. 13, the anti-tax initiative     Charles Manson     I told him that, other than Manson, everything he mentioned has one connecting thread:  Orange County ,  California , a massive sprawl of land and people between  Los Angeles  and   San   Diego  . Nixon was born there, Reagan got 75% of the vote there, and a big statue of the Duke, who lived and died there, greets you upon landing at  Orange   County ’s   John    Wayne   Airport  .                    Orange   County  has been called the “spiritual base” for American’s conservatives-and every loony, right-wing idea the country had to fight over the years seems to have got its start in   Orange    County  . Californians are, naturally, embarrassed by this and often try to shift the blame for  America ’s rightward drift to Southern rednecks and Bible Belters or, lately, the militias of  Montana  and   Michigan  .                   But the sad truth is that the Republican Revolution had its birth in   California  . And at this point in time, my friend announced that he knew less about American politics that I do, and so I let off on the elaboration. Till now, he was right that  Orange   County  is the most screwed up place in   America  . Being one of the richest counties comparable to Grosse Pointe and  Westchester , it had actually declared itself bankrupt in December 1994. How does one of the richest counties in the country go  bankrupt ? Apparently the county treasurer had invested the taxpayers’ money in high risk “derivatives” that were tied to the fluctuations of the interest rates.                     County   Treasurer   Robert Citron, according to the U.S News and World Report, “had borrowed $12.5 billion and poured the money into these derivatives-financial agreements whose values are based on an underlying asset such as a bond. But as the Fed steadily boosted interest rates that year, Orange County got caught in a bind; it had to pay more on it’s borrowings than it was earning on its investments.” This spread led to   Orange   County  ’s debacle.                   Like most of you, I don’t have a clue about what I’ve just quoted, but the rich understand all of this and that’s how they got rich in the first place. We would expect the treasurer of  Davenport  to screw up something this complicated, but not the barons of wealth in   Orange   County  . I think it’s embarrassing to have the rest of the world see just how stupid our rich people are. (What my friend said, I hadnt managed to respeech it.)                    But this high-rolling investment backfired in   Orange    County  -and the residents lost a whooping $1.7 billion of their tax money! The rich, unlike us, get really pissed when they lose that kind of money. (When we lose our $30,000 a year job, we just take more Prozac.)                   Blame was thrown everywhere and the leaders of OC were running to state capital in   Sacramento   and begging for a bailout. They suddenly thought welfare was a good idea. They sent a plea to   Washington   for help. This many rich people had not been collectively choked since the Titanic hit that iceberg.                   The politicians of   Sacramento   were understandably not all that eager to go out on a limb for the county that them to fuck off. How would it look for those politicians to start bailing their constituents’ rich butts out of hock when millions of Californians have lost everything they had for far less stupidity?                   The legislature told OC that charity begins at home and that in the true spirit of volunteerism, they would use their thousand points of light to pass a countrywide tax to pay off their own debts.                   That didn’t work out and OC has come up with a brilliant idea to raise money. They have declared they will open their landfills to their neighbors. Other communities can now bring their trash to OC and dump it there-for a fee. The OC landfill will accept-at a price of up to $35 a ton-the trash from nearby counties. They are hoping they would take in $15 million a year for the next 20 years.                   But to do that, they need to attract 5000 tons of trash a day. That’s a lot of garbage, even by Californian standards, and I worry that they will not be able to meet their quota.                   So let’s help them out! Send them your garbage! It will make you feel good (ah, to dump it on OC) and you’ll be performing a community service (raising money to help them pay off that $1.7 billion debt). This is reverse Reaganomics in action. HAHA!                    So gather up all your empty Wheaties boxes, your orange juice cans, last night’s pizza boxes, those socks with the holes in them, and send them to a private trash hauler contracted to use   Orange    County  ’s landfill:                        Taormina Industries, Inc.                     PO Box  309                      Anaheim ,  CA    92815                 Taormina   has agreed to accept the trash of the people who are willing to send them-provided you send along payment for the dump. According to my friend, in order to comply to U.S. Postal Service regulations, you must make sure that nothing you send has too foul an odor, and that it won’t leak, blow up, or emit radiation. It  is  permissible to send garbage. But make sure that it is wrapped properly and has the correct amount of postage on it. Mark on the outside  PROJECT ORANGE DUMP , and indicate “charitable garbage enclosed.” Be sure to enclose a payment for the dump. That’s $35 a ton, or 2 cents a pound, plus a couple of extra dollars for handling. (People not in   America   should take care to pay for international postage delivery charges)                   Remember that you’ll be doing this for the good of the county. Send you trash to the OC now!             The above post was taken from bits and pieces of information my friend and I had discussed on MSN Messenger, plus sources from some research.
