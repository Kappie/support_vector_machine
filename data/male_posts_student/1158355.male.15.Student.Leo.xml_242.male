Anyways, then Matt's brother stole everyone from my house except me and Heaton and so there was 2 sleep overs. One here and one at Matt's. I was told Paul kicked the shit out of Matt at Matt's. Awesome. In the morning Jay came to my house and us 3 (Heaton Jay and I) just hung out and I discovered that my old Creed cd (My Own Prison) which I ever barely listened to when I got it is awesome!!! I love it. It's exactly like Pearl Jam. Download "Sister." Best song ever. Oh and Jay showed me some 12 Stones. And Jay and I realized we're the same and know all the same songs and love the same music but the only disagreement we had was with girls. I don't know how it came up but I said Amanda Greco was extremely hot and he said no but Amanda if you read this don't get mad and kill Jay because he also said Avril Lavigne wasn't hot. Oh and Heaton went home and then Jay and I hung out with Dina Mullingbrook and this other girl Melissa...I don't why. Jay set it up. It was very funny. Too lazy to explain. Yea but, uh, we hung out at Starbucks and around town. I got my mom a coffee. She was happy. It was some weird cold coffee, the weirdest thing I've ever seen. A cold coffee. It looked like Pepsi but then I took a sip and I barfed. Well not really. Anyways!!!!...then Jay and I went to Paul's and then we went to my house and played some MARIO PARTY 5! Then everyone went home. TODAY, I went to my cousin Ryan's graduation party and got to ride a mini dirtbike around a huge field. It kicked ass. I want one so badly but they're expensive. And if I did get one, I'd have to take time away from my drumming. After Ryan's party we went to my cousin Katie's graduation party but didn't hang out with Britt or Kate at all because they had certain people in my grade over that I don't like...I'm not sure anyone likes em. So I hung out with Danny and Chris the whole time in the pool and ended up somehow enjoying throwing little children into the pool. They asked me to, but I enjoyed it. Another stress reliever. Well that's all of it. And it's August 1st...well this blog is being typed on August 1st but I changed the date to the 31st because really August 1st is now but I haven't gone through the day yet. I think I'm gonna go to bed now because I'm trying to wake up early so I have more of the summer days and less of summer nights. Ok, good bye and till tomorrow night or perhaps the next, or the next.
