Today we had and Olympics theme, so we played lots of olympic sports like Shotput, Discus, Javelin, and some other stuff.  First off, we had the middler group, as always.  They had a big class, so we couldn't give them all too many turns, but it was still fun.  They played all of the sports well, and i was surprised how far they could throw in the distance throw event.  I mean, i had trouble throwing that far... buy i am "side arm Jon" afterall... So, they had fun.  Next came the pre-teens, and since they also had a pretty big class, so, again, we only played each sport one time each person.  They also had fun.   Then came break time.  Today we had popcorn and rice crispy squares.  I didn't have the pop corn, but the rice crispys were good.  Then we had the smaller groups... they all played the same game and all had fun!  Well, today was a good day for all of the kids.   When we were leaving, i got to back out the car again, AND drive it out of the parking lot!  I was pro!!!  w00t!  I get to do that every day... i might get to go a bit farther next time... ^_^.  Now i'm tired, and i think i'm going to go lie down or something!   Lates
