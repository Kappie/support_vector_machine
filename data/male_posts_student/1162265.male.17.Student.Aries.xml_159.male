Oh well, Samone showed up which would have been an excellante thing, except Chris had bought tickets to some other concert in NYC, and Monie just bounced.  It really sucked, although I stayed a bit longer.  It was about as boring as a Jack and Jill dance is awkward.  So, ehhh....  Silly Monie just bouncing.   Whatever, I wasted the rest of my time hanging out with Zach and Aaron, and we walked around like crazy.   Then we came back, and the more I stood around, the more I was like "Damn, no girls I want to talk to (besides Allie and Co. of course), I better bounce. "  So after talking to Alec, I got a ride home from him, and now I feel like crap, as expected.
