George Will has always commanded my respect and admiration.  Today, he has transcended that respect and achieved a new high.  This should be carved on granite slabs and placed in the center of every city.    If you do nothing else, PLEASE read this.  It is long, and as with all Will pieces - complex.  But it is like a clap of thunder in a small room.
