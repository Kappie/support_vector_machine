How important is diet to the practice of magic?    Very  If the mind is not focused then the energies manipulated in magic can not be controlled.  Which raises the question of how to focus the mind?  The mind requires several things to work properly, food is one of them.  If you do not eat properly then the mind goes haywire - if you don't know what I mean try drugs.  But whats more is that different people need different diets, which raises the question of how to know when your own diet is correct?  Look at your own diet, if you feel sleepy or off peak after eating then you should change your diet - and certainly things like alcohol and drugs, which have a reputation for changing the mind, should be avoided.   On the other end of the scale, if you are feeling figity then try adding a wider variety of food into your diet.  However you play with your diet remember the number one rule: If in doubt, see your health professional.
