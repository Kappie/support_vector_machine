It doesn't really matter to much, I've felt happy lately, and I guess in the long run to me being happy is the be all and end all.  I started to read the Gospel of Thomas, I seriously need to buy the rest of the Gnostic Books, they have some pretty heavy sayings of Jesus, much better then the ones in the Gospel.  No wonder the early church tried to burn these books......  6) His disciples questioned Him and said to Him, "Do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Shall we give alms? What diet shall we observe?" Jesus said, "Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of Heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered."  -"Gospel of Thomas"  Anyway.  I really need to work on my social life, I'm a little to in the clouds for my own good.
