Anywho,My brother is gone for the night so his computer is mine muahaha :p I'll be up laaaate with the computer. Especially to listen to my favourite radio show Last Call on 580 CFRA at midnight. I like talk radio more than just music all the time. I like hearing people talking etc.. and them being live. I call in every week but my parents don't know because it's a 1-800 number and i have been listening to it since it started which was i think october or november. I can hardly sleep with no radio softly on so I don't think so I sleep :) Also my brother accidently deleted everything of mine AND his. so all of my files are gone and my bookmarks are gone but thankfully i remembered all of them. Today has been a stressful but in the end it's a good one. BYE
