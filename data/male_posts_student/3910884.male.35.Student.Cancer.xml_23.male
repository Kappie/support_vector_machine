Isang,  Bansa isang,  Diwa di ba?     Forgiveness of Sins   I,  Forgive you,  For your sins.     Sex Bomb   Sex,  Bomb Girls,  Aye so grabe!     Filipino Driver   Pinoy,  Driving crazy,  Shit my pants!     Your Laughter   Your,  Laughter fills,  Me with delight.     Sufer not the Unclean  (This is inpsired from a tabletop game I play called Warhammer 40,000)  Suffer,  Not the,  Unclean to live.    To,  Destroy the,  Enemies of Mankind.    Cleanse,  The Mutant,  Of his deviancy.    Purge,  The Heretic,  Of his sins.    Burn,  The Witch,  For his transgressions.    This,  Is the,  Emperor's will fulfilled.
