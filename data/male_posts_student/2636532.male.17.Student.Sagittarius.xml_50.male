I know that you all don't care about wht i'm saying..well some of you do, some of you i'm sure are kind and compassionate people that care about every living thing, and then there are those other people that are probably only readig this to see if the person writing is worse off then you just so you can laugh at them. it's kinda sad that there are people out there that take joy from the suffering of others...but anywho, back to my random bitching. so i watched The Simpons today for the fist time in about 3 months, it was bullshit! yea it was sorta funny and everything but right at the end they started singing the Canadian national athem and they sung it freaking wrong!!!! seriously to me there's almost no bigger insult then fucking making fun of that song! i'm sure that they didn't mean it in that way, but still it's the song that every canadian knows and loves, little 6 year old school children can sing it, 100 year old grandfathers and grandmothers can sing it, it's one of the things that's makes a canadian, well, Canadian! I'm proud to be Canadian, atleast i'm not some fuckshit American whose got his head shoved way to far up his own ass that i can't see that the whole fucking world doesn't revolve arond me. Canada's got it great, we don't have the crime of other countries, we don't have the pollution (although yes i'm aware that canadians do make the most garbage in the world), we don't have the mass amount of wide spread poverty, we don't have the horrible health care of other countries, no over-population, no need to fear for our lives everyday, and no fascist dictator telling us how to live, most of all we don't have a stupid bull fucked president that wants to start a war with every country that doesn't see it his way. what a fucked up world this is, and with human nature the way it is, it can only get worse. -Matt
