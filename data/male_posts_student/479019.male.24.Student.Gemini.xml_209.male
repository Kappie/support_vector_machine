The notion of good will towards others is something I've been really thinking about. I was wondering if there is any way of acting without selfishness or self-interest. For example... good people... when they do good things, they always say that doing good things makes them feel good. There's defineately a reward system built in. So does the motivation involve self-interest? For religious people, they do things because of God. Well, isn't fear of going to hell or the desire to please a deity kind of motivated by self-interest? I remember having a discussion about this with Lisa eons ago about this. I won't go into the details on that discussion, but I really do believe that all human action revolves around the self. It just happens that some of those self motivated actions happens to help others in society. I think people just don't want to accept a value-less paradigm of looking at things, because it doesn't benefit them.  Oh yea.. I'm like so poor right now! Bleh!  **
