The Timberwolves won, now all they have to do is win one in L.A., then come back and win Game 7 in Minneapolis, man I hope they can do it!!!  Update on my script:  I'm at 91 pages as of right now...I was going to finish it off tonight...but I figure I better sleep, anyway, all I have to do is write like ten more pages of the ending, which is already in my head, so IT WILL BE DONE TOMORROW!!!.....First rough rough rough rough draft of course, this will need serious revision, which is what week 2 is about, so...not bad to come up with a final draft of a movie in 2 weeks, I think that's pretty good, considering it took me like six months to get a final draft of my first one....sorry, now I'm just droning on and bragging....again, sorry....I guess the writing's been getting to me, 19,000 words will do that to a person.  OH!  Yesterday I saw The Day After Tomorrow, I'll post my review later, but despite some clunky dialogue, it was an awesome movie with uber-impressive graphics.
