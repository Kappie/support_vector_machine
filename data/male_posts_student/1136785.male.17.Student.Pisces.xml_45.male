Instead, here are some articles (links; make me look smart with a minimum of effort!):  - Another way Kerry could  urlLink learn from Kennedy . I already posted about Kennedy actually being a supply side economist, but this one tells Kerry to imitate Kennedy by almost disregarding the economy as the issue. 2004 is an election much like 1960, where an unknown senator from Massachusetts faced Richard Nixon, who had eight years of White House experience and the vice president of beloved War God Dwight Eisenhower (and unlike Gore, used his former boss). The economy was in trying to recover from recession, so Kennedy campaigned for the economy, right? Wrong. He took perhaps the harshest Republican Cold Warrior toe to toe on national security, advocating from the right, not the left - and he won. Interesting stuff.  - A must for anyone who wants to be informed.  urlLink Ten truths about trade  also from Reason. Why trade, globalization, and offshoring are all good for the US economy and nothing to be afraid of. And why this is not the first time we've been terrified that we were running out of jobs.  - It's  urlLink Election time  in the world's fourth most populous  and largest muslim country - Indonesia! For the first time in their history, the Indonesian people are directly electing their President (previously it had been done by the National Assembly). An extremely high turnout of 80% and the calm professionalism (barring a Pop Idol contest between two leading former generals) of the election seems almost shocking compared to the typical, if biased, news that comes out of Indonesia. There have been some ballot tampering concerns, but for the most part it appears to havee gone off without a hitch across Indonesia's 17,000 islands. No one candidate appears to have managed the required 50% to declare immediate victory, so there will be Run-Offs in September. The front runner Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, an former General who is pro west and reform and heads his own small party, with 34% of the counted vote will likely face off against his former boss and current President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who has managed 27%.   That's enough linking for now. I'm tired and need to sleep for once. The new Economist has a bunch of great articles this week - I would link but most are suscriber only. I may do a more detailed analysis/rant when I have more time. Whatever forces me to learn about a subject. I do need to read more about Yukos, and that certainly falls into the very boring category. Hugo Chavez is also doing his best to boondoggle the opposition who finally got a referendum/recall vote on his presidency to come about. Should be interesting. More famously, Bill Cosby, along with Jesse Jackson, has come out with a widely publicized harsh broadside against black america and education. It can actually be tied together with the criticism against Affirmative Action, and perhaps Bush's least touted initiatives and possible successes, No Child Left Behind. Who wants to try hard when you don't have to? And why does prejudice and poverty hold back African American children when Asian Americans from the same settings can achieve? If there truly is a cultural difference in Asian values, can't there possibly be some negative cultural influence against education in (young) Black America? Bill Cosby seems to think so. But I may just be being racist.  But I'm done for now.
