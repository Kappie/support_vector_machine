I was with them for a while and I headed up the RPG News section.  It was pretty cool.  I got free games and wrote reviews for them.  Well, I left and shortly after the site started to get more and more of a sell out look to it.  Now it's a giant piece of shit.  Ah well, I thought maybe I'd write a review when I play new games.  I'll do one on Riddick soon (awsome game.)   So, now for the pictures.   First up is Driv3r.  To sum stuff up for you so you can skip this paragraph if you like, the game sucks.  Sucks goats ass.  If you want more detail of why I would say that, it's because I don't believe repeating segments of a game over, and over, and over, and over...is any fun at all.  If I wanted to do something over and over again I would drink a lot of Coke or Coffee.  Now, the good points of this game can be summed up on 3 fingers.   First finger:   The CG is quite well done, and the voice acting is good quality.  Second finger:   Blowing shit up is always fun, and this game does it very well.  Third finger:   Use the Film Director thing to edit the way you watch yourself blowing shit up.  That pretty much sums it up.  The single player game is annoying and uses an inexcusable design.   My beautiful Steel Batallion  controller is the next picture down.  Now, this thing cost me more than $200 (can't remember exactly), but it's the coolest controller I've  ever  seen, in or out of an arcade.  The problem with it is the game is super hard.  There are like 20 levels and I can't get past the 4th level.  Unfortunately Action Reply can't help me with it.  Most unfortunate since I'd really love to play the later levels.  Ah well.   The last picture I'm posting  today is of my Xbox.  I love Xbox.  I adorned my Xbox with this sticker a good long while ago and I still love it.  Gives it a little bit of extra flavour I think.  Anyway, it's 0020hrs and I'm getting tired.  I think I'll watch a movie and then go to sleep.
