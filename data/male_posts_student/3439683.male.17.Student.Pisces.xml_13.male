Went to this place with Jennifer, a bunch of people playing bluegrass music. it was pretty cool, this one guy told me to bring my guitar next time, said he'd show me how to play some stuff. Then other guy, he smashed a stink bomb right next to me, it was only the size of a pill, but DUDE.....that was putrid. Jen nearly puked. We left right after that. She dropped me off here, and I showed her that new song that I wrote. Noticed how beautiful she is, depressed me a little. I mean, she's just a friend, a really good one at that, but I couldn't help envying Chris M. a little. oh well. I'm over it now. I'm lucky to have her as a friend, and I need to keep my outlook on life positive, I realize that. That outlook says that there is someone out there for me that is better for me than anyone else, and that it won't be too much longer before I find her. I really don't have the energy to say any thing else tonight, I'm tired, so I'm outta here.
