Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Jesus Walks -Kanye West Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #11 The harder of the two religious summer singles (the other is  R. Kelly's  urban inspirational, "U Saved Me"), Kanye West's "Jesus Walks" gives hope to even the hippest. Strutting over his own pride of gruff disciples, Kanye reinvents as a prophet while his backdrop grows with an orchestra, soul choir, and that tattered cell phone wriggle. Sure, he bites  Adam Sandler  (that "shit for breakfast" line) and  Nas  (the first rapper to self-crucify with "Hate Me Now"), but when Kanye claims that "radio needs this single," he's not overestimating. This track is lyrically superior to  Jadakiss'  curiously immature "Why," musically superior to  D12's  anthem of darkness "How Come," and artistically superior to anything on the  Billboard  charts. No, we're not looking at a lyrical catchphrase ("Jesus walks!"), but if the son of God times the whole "second resurrection" thing correctly (before this Kanye song falls out of heavy radio airtime), he might just reappear with a head bob.   The Verdict:  9.2/10 - The Fork   (4.6/5)      2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry
