I suppose chances are I'm going to end up just another kinda dumb non-personal-thoughts thing, since I'm not enough of a newshound to be filled with link-y goodness, but I thought I'd enjoy having a place to record some of the things I think that might be not too stupid. Nothing at the moment, really, but there'll be plenty soon I have no doubt.
