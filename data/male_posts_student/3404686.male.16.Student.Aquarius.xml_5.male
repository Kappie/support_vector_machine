On a lighter note, their are only four more days of school, which is both good and bad. It is good because their is a three month vaction, but it is bad because of EXAMS...I have to do some major studying, so I can pass. Next year I am going to PENTA, it is a tech. school, most people that go their are stupid, I am fairly intelligent. I am going so that I can get my A+ Certifacation through the class I am taking. I also would like to go to college, hopefully MIT, this class will make the transition to college a lot easier. Well I am out of stuff to write for today, check back later to see what I'm up to.  Later
