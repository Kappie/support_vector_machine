The day we have to leave suddenly a big thunderstorm pops up and leads to a delay and a really bumpy ride. :-( Ft. Lauderdale was nice but I think I can confirm what Dave Barry says of Floridians....They are CRAZY.gah...I have more to say but I'm tired and about to fall asleep while typing. Blogging must wait.
