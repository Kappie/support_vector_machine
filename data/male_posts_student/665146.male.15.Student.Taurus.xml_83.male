It's only been three days, and already, I'm braindead from a single freewriting practice.  We were encouraged to write away all conscious thought, and let our subconscious drive our writing.  I'd like to post what I wrote.  It's not quite anything besides a random occuring of thoughts, so please excuse the confusion:   Clarity, I don't believe it exists anymore. Nor does the profound Or the inspirational. There is only guesswork to be done Pioneering the future with a game of poker Magic 8 Ball mechanical prophet Evolution needless packaging Thought within a thought within a thought within that condom wrapper you keep in your wallet  Waiting until you get to use it  Your mind is a masturbatory car wreck A joke to your God  Do you know your God?  He's Jeff.  And he's thinking And I'm thinking And we shouldn't Because we watch TV                                       Opiate infinitum continuum  Relief is self preservation  And sticking around is suicide No reason?  Plenty!  Heck, it's funny                               Hilarious too                              Boisterous  Cancerous and charming, he slipped from under the bed Abortionist extraordinaire, he speaks in croaks and gurgles, over the class and through concrete to neutralize children with lights and toys and, yes, secrets.  "Tell me a promise and a lie."  They're the same if you love your God.  "Believe in me and you shall find peace"?  No.  Believe in me or I won't exist Believe in me or you won't fight. Believe in me because I'm beautiful  Blink and repeat process:  Religion death sorrow retalliation  Victory death religion   Looking at it, I realize that it's much more fun when I'm braindead...
