On Lothar's birth certificate is a swaztika, It is an emblem of his pure aryan heritage.     You don't understand war , Lothar says to me in a non-agressive tone, only looking to enlighten me.   I lived through four wars.  I grew up in a Nazi family.  That is racism.  I was taught to believe there were subhuman people out there, people worth nothing.  I was taught hate.    No one is for war,  Lothar says after I tell him about my anti-war demonstrating, a practice he discourages.  He sits upright, eyes focused, sentences short, finding meaning best in his quick rhetoric contact.   There is nothing more brutal, more demonizing, more inhuman than slaughter.  When I was in Vietnam  (Lothar was a businessman in Singapore during the late Kennedy/early Johnson years of the war...he spent a lot of time near an American air base, and often found shelter there),  a boy was flown in to the air base, dying.  He was from Idaho.  He wanted a steak to eat.  We got him the steak, and he died eating it.   I won't pretend to capture his thoughts any more, because I am truly inefficient in relating his stories.  But in talking about war and politics and Bush and Iraq, I found we were saying a lot of the same things.  Which was interesting, because I always considered myself avidly liberal, and everyone considers Lothar a staunch conservative.     We all have energy.  And we need to use that energy in a constructive manner.  That can come from love.  I know the other side of love...I saw it when I was young, I see it today.  You can't focus on hate.  You can only get going in love.   I still don't think war was, or is, right.  I am still upset at the way America portrays itself as a world savior, yet policy dictates a me-first attitude.    But does that make me a liberal?  Why are there liberals who want to do more bombing?  Why are there conservatives who truly do hate war?    Brian Thomas and I played a game one night after some illicit drug usage.  After everything someone said, you'd just ask them why.  Why?  Why?  Why?  You go until you can't figure out why.  That is when you realize language is a fallacy.  Or that you hold no original thoughts, and can only regurgitate the party line through so many levels.    Tonight, it was one question for me.  Why am I a liberal?    I care about people.  I wish people had the opportunities I have/had.   I hate the rich/poor gap.  I liked a lot of socialism, but Free Enterprise isn't so bad either.    It's furstrating to align yourself in a camp that you don't agree with, and find many people you do agree with in other camps.  Then you're just arguing politics just to exercise your rhetorical muscles.  What good does it do?  I hate the bitching and yelling on MSNBC and Fox News, and I boost myself up when I don't take part in the pettiness.  Yet tonight, I rolled my sleeves and gave it a run with old Lothar.    Labels.  The more I think, I find the less I know.
