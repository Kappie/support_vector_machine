Conveniently, new Nvidia drivers came out that support Fedora Core 2's kernel, so I can now play games with a frame rate that isn't measured it the single digits.  I got 5s on all my AP tests, which is a definite bonus.  I was surprised to find that out.  I figured I would barely get a 4 on lang and calc...I didn't feel confident at all.  My lang teacher never gave me higher than a C on any paper all year, so I was kinda worried.  Hah.  Sucker.  Calc was seemingly a mess but apparently I got it taken care of.  Human geo was a wank, as expected.  Spider-Man 2 was spectacular.  I mean, damn.  It had it all - action, comedy, romance.  Makes you wanna do something heroic, but there is a distinctive lack of tall building in Aurora from which one could swing.  Shame.  Kirsten Dunst is hot as a redhead.  I'm going to a family reunion sometime in July, which is weird cause I've never met most of my cousins and uncles and stuff.  All my grandparents are dead and the rest of my relatives live nowhere near Colorado (they're concentrated in Ohio and Indiana and thereabouts) but I get to go to Cedar Point, the single greatest roller coaster park in America, so it's all good.  Can't wait.
