I FUCKING WISH!!!!   Eatin penuts. It's 3 am. I can't stop pacing. I reverted to coloquial speech for a second, back there. What is happening to me!? AAAAH! Well, actually it's party mix. Ha! I wish there was a party...  Do you ever feel out of place? Like you shouldn't be where you are? I feel like I shouldn't be here right now. Getting close to feeling like I shouldn't even be breathing. It's like my life is out of place.  Maybe I should be dead. Maybe I should be touring the French countryside with my band of scallywags, looting the bourgoise.  Just more weird things I cannot explain.  You know, the sun does not seem as bright as it once was. The clouds not as white. The day hath become night. Hey, that was a rhyme! I wish I could do that all the time! *gasp*  Halucinations aside, I've been out of place pretty much my entire life. I was never a skater. I dressed it, but I couldn't skate to save my life. I was never a punk. I dressed it, but would instead listen to heavy metal. I'm sorry, punk just blows. Shallow examples, I know, but they prove my point, don't they? OK OK fine. So me and my friends are hangin out in the drama room during lunch. I don' take drama, but they all do, so they hang out there a lot. Mr. Jack walks in, and basically tells me that I'm not allowed to be in there because I don't take drama! HAAAAAAAA! My friends are always trying to get me to join drama. Apparently I'm a fairly good actor. I act like I'm happy a lot. Fuck drama class, I've got better ways to waste my time. Either way, I just don't fit in. I don't fit in with her friends. I don't fit in with the people around me. I don't fit in to this planet.  A random product of an unequivocal, irevocable chain of events, ultimately amounting to an inbalance in the equation.  The oceans aren't as blue. Blue. My eyes are blue, too. At least, they  were .     I think I am the sum of a random chain of events. Think about it.  In a one in a million chance, I meet the girl of my dreams, the one girl who saves my life. Literally, one in a fucking million.  First, I wanted to go to Western, but they denied my application. So then I had to go to forest lawn. At forest lawn I made a friend after quite an extended period of lonliness. That friend breaks up with his girlfriend. He leaves. I stay. I become friends with that girlfriend, whom I just so happened to have a crush on. She saves my life. She rescues me. What are the odds? Seriously.  Why was Iso drawn to her? This, this I know why. She was always so alive. She was always so vivacious, so full of life. Always dancing around, singing, and just plain frolicing in general. She was so happy.  Me, I was a fuckin walking corpse. Depressed, bitter and cynical. Seeing her so happy. So alive.   Seeing her like that showed me that it was okay to live again. I wanted her. I wanted that happiness. I wanted life again.  Hey. She was the Lupita Ramos to my John Creasy. That brings a tear.  Can anyone say "dilemma"? Dill-em-ma.   Here I am saying how unhappy I've been for the last three years, but I left out one small bit. For one moment, one moment I was happy. It was her birthday. Her 16th birthday. I think it might have been on the30th (although she was born on the 29th) of March. I remember...We were all watching movies there in the dark. It must've been 1 am or so. We sat there, next to each other, staring into the TV. I don't quite know, or remember, moreso, how or why we touched hands, but we did. I held her hand. I held it in mine, and it was like nothing I had ever felt before. No feeling was stronger than that. Electricity flowed through me. Not the high-voltage, low-amp crap you get from a taser, it was pure ecstacy. My heart fluttered. My breath drew short. It was the greatest feeling ever.  For that one, single instant, I was the happiest man on earth. It was pure, true happiness. Pure, true love. At that moment, at that instant, I knew she was the one. I knew she would be the one that would make me whole. For that moment,I knew everything was going to be okay.  I would experience all of the pain, I would take a world of pain, I would endure countless hours of torture, just to experience that one more time. For one more moment. Just ONE!  I knew she was the one. I KNOW she IS the one. I feel it. I feel it in my heart, in my mind. In my soul I know. There is not a shred of doubt. I can't even consider anybody else. I can't even consider any other woman. I know it's her. I know it.  If I know it so well, how come it has not come to pass? How come nothing is right? How come everything is so out of place? Why is everything broken? Did my heart lie to me?  Who will I trust then, if I cannot trust my heart?
