I work now at a McDonalds and like Im the guy who does the burgers and I feel sorry for whoever eats my burgers because I cant cook!..lol  At first it was hard to understand how to use the oven and all the machinary but I figured it all out in the end thanks to a very cool co-worker of mines, Alejandro. He basically taught me everything there is to know while working in Mickey D's.  From what I see. Imma try to keep the job or at least until I get my check! :D  lol.   Wel to conclude its been a great 1st day of work as my 1st job. I gotta go sleep now its getting late. I'll keep blogging lata aight ;-).  Jay Jay
