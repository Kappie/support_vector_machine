I am 15 and going into 10 grade this year. Crap school is about to start soon and I haven't done anything this summer. Ok I've breathed but that's about it. Fine also an occasional trip to a friends house, football camp, and i met Jackie. My summer has been so boring except the Jackie part =). I guess I should tell you about myself but I'm to lazy to do that right now. See you later
