She was tired of wishing and getting horror in return. Why could know one see that behind the happy child was a child shredded and ripped by the hands of life. She was afraid and alone. She was tired of trusting and then getting deeply hurt. With each flick of the knife the decision grew easier. Only a few would know she ws gone. Not many would care. Though the world did not revolve around her, her existence would not really effect many. No one would miss her in their life. So , she raised the knife for one last plunge.. for one last breath.   it scares me to think... it could have been me... one more moment... and all i would have had left was... one last breath... i love you Vida...
