The paper was simple but they made it look difficult, even though the time limit was extended to 2 hrs from 90 mins. Only three people had some clue about the paper. The rest..?? Infact one or two walked out of the test saying that they could figure out nothing. Fine now lets come to the result:     Nikhil Agarwal (XI-H)  : He came first. Had extremely clear logic and solved two questions. Also knows web designing and flash animation. He has been selected.   Swati (XI-I)  : She also has been selected. She managed to figure out the logic of crypting question and almost made the program.   Niharika Mittal (XI-L)  : She almost managed to figure the logic behind Aurojit Panda's question.    Well you can also attempt the paper. You can download it  urlLink here . Do post your comment on the difficulty level of the paper. In case you manage to crack any of it, send it to us by e-mail at  urlLink souvikdg@gmail.com  Please do not post the solution as a comment due to two important reasons. Firstly, because the comment becomes too long and secondly, because some people have been given this paper to try at home.   Schedule for programming test of class VIII-IX has not been finalised. It shall   be posted on logexun whenever it is ready.
