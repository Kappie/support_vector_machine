I'm going to kick his ass though because I want to use it primarily.  He'll try to steal it, but I'll hide it under my pillow so he can't take it.  With that said, I'll probably post my pictures now.  The thing is the best camera I've ever used and I only used it for like 5 pictures.  Wow.  Much love for Canon.  Gatta go to practice though.  Peace in the middle east.
