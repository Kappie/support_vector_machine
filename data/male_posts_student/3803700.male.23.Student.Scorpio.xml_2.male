Being asked by the most salient commission in all the land this gentleman was to testify before it, and before the world.  The gentleman I speak of is Sandy Berger, and he came under a great amount of criticism today, when it was leaked that he had taken documents and not returned them.  What the FBI is telling us up to this point is that all documents are accounted for except for a few, and that Mr. Berger took them out of a federal facility without asking, probably in his leather binder.  Bill Clinton told reporters that the documents missing, those in question were duplicated and is available at other federal facilities.  The 9/11 Commission, the commission for which Mr. Berger was reviewing the document for is satisfied with what Mr. Berger has told them, and required nothing else of him.  To hear Flush Limbaugh or Sean “Hannitize ya” Hannity talk about it, you would think that Berger was selling top secret information to Al Qaeda from the back of his car.  Hannity claims that Berger smuggled out vital documents in his pants and sox, and disposed of them so that the Clinton Administration could not be blamed for its possible neglect of important information.  The information it seems was in reference to the Millennium plot, a plot that was successfully thwarted by Richard Clarke’s team and the Clinton Administration. The fact that the report was leaked just two days before the 9/11 Commission is set to release its report, a report that potentially will be very critical of the Bush Administration, is somewhat suspect.  The fact that Hannity and Limbaugh and others will claim that this is Clinton trying to cover his tail is also absurd, it was the Bush Administration who so vehemently opposed the creation of the commission in the first place.  If you were waiting for the Administrations “pre-report surprise” here you go.
