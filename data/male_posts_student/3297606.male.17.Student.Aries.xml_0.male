Here are some guidlines to follow when talking, thinking, or hanging out with Jerry.  1. He has no other name than "Jerry." If you try and prnounce his last name you will probably get shot. 2. never expect a normal conversation. 3. never tug at his hair, there are crocodiles in his hat.  now that your ready to meet Jerry, you can. good. well, today is thursday, and tyler and mike are off paintballing with their team. i guess if thursdays arent exciting, they are interesting. I hung out with Jerry a biut after school. we made laughter and made people around us really uncomfortable, as usual. there was a fight and jerry and i decided that it was because someone stole the big guys basket of fruit. after that was settled we let everyone know, so it was OK.  we then proceeded to have a fight of our own, it looked fun, so why not?. we decided that it would be over a small piece of green plastic that Jerry took from me. so we made the exchange and started yelling at each other. everyone kinda looked, like "woah hoh another fight???" but then they realized that it was me and Jerry and knew what was going on. after that got old we lit Dr. Pawlick on fire. just kidding, we didnt even have any matches.  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King came out on DVD on tuesday, i still dont have it. i need it. thats what i SHOULD be doing right now. oh well... i will get it. Typing to the melodies of Unwritten Law is fun too.  I want to dye my hair black. i am going to do it. im not sure when, but im going to do it.  Bible study tonight... woohoo (i didnt actually say woohoo). They are good, but i dunno... the environment of it has gotten screwed up as of late, well its actually always been this way. I wish it would be more of a discussion than a lesson, more of a relaxed thing. I dont like it when there is a "teacher." i guess thats why i like Glens "martians" group so much, everybody has an equal say. I dont wanna create any fires, so im just gonna hang in there and see what happens. we started doing some recreational stuff recently, thats cool... hopefully its gettin better (not that it was ever bad). i have to watch what i say about some things on here because other people read them, but hey, this is my blog. i shouldnt have to worry, i dont want people coming up to me and saying "why dont you like thursdays?" because i DO like thursdays... i just am thinking out loud when i write these things. there are a whole lot of good things about thursdays.  thats a disadvantage about everyone knowing about your blog, you always have to try and not offend people, or you dont want some people reading some things. so blogs turn into just trying to please your audience. well SCREW YOU audience. ha! ok, i was just kidding about screwing the audience (that sounded sick) but yea, im going to be saying some things every once in a while that might offend someone or, as i said before, start some fires... but its nothing personal, i dont hate anyone... but just letting you know, from this point on i am going to try and not hold too many things back, im gonna be blunt. so dont read this if you cant deal with it.  wow this blog changed directions fast... started out as a fun blog about jerry, now its about international terrorism.  oh, and i dont feel like glorifying anyone anymore, it got old fast.... so get off your ego trip, jerk.  current: the southern current current looking forward to thing: airsoft
