I know that I will have to make this day up, but I really did not feel like going to wrestling practice.  Next weekend I will be at Hamilton Heights for sectionals, if anyone wants to come they can.  I am hoping to get at least fourth place, so that i can go on to regionals.  This weekend I took the SATs.  They were boring, but I think that I did ok on them.  I hope I did well enough to not have to take them again, so that I can get into Purdue.  That is all that I have.
