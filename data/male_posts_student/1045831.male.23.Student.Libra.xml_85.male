I met one guy, Juan, who was from Bolivia.  One of the funniest guys ever.  I laughed my ass off everytime I was around this kid.  I also met a bunch of other people that were cool and some nice ladies as well.  Did lots of cool stuff and anyone who has the oppertunity to take part in this program I would say to do it.  I know this was probably a boring update but School is just starting so things will start to get wild later.  Peace out kids..
