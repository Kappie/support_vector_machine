Sorry Alex if you tried to call me today, I forgot this was the weekend we went to Gustavus again.  Which was fun I guess but a little boring.  But I guess I learned it can be fun to go someplace far away without intending to do anything in particular.  But I wish I had a camera with me.  St. Peter has some really cool stuff that woulda been good to get.  Oh well :(  Lets see.... We drove down (up?) yesterday after school and stayed in a hotel (we got a fireplace suite because they originally gave us a smoking room *cough*)  Well, first thing in the morning Amy had her audition for the music scholarship there, which involved numerous hours of waiting, sleeping, thinking.  Then we met with Emilie (thats Jenni's sis) and she took Amy away, hehe, so we went and drove around, and thats when I saw a lot of the cool things I wanted to take pictures of, and we ate at a 50s diner, came back, and drove home.  Yup thats about it.  Everyone's been really morbid lately at lunch...  I don't get it.  actually just the ones that are in logan's "sex group."  They never tell me anything.  Could that be because I don't tell them much anymore? maybe I don't know.  I don't know much anymore.  Life is hard to understand.
