Anyhow, I guess I'll tell a bit about myself. I'm Amanda but most people call me Mandy.    LOOKS: black hair (originally red) hazel eyes fair skin 5ft 5in 98 lbs.   I'm going to be 14 on August 30th. I'm not really that "popular" in school or anything. I stick to just a small group of friends and tell the rest to fuck off. lol. Most people call me either punk or gothic. Damn stereotypes. I like to listen to music, take pictures(that DOES NOT include getting pictures of me unless I want them taken), draw, meet new people, learn how to play guitar, and think about Curt. lol. No he's not my boyfriend although I wish he was. He's got a girlfriend and he's 25. So basically I have no chance. Oh and also I write poetry and I'm attempting to write lyrics.   Okay now back to my day...it sucked. Just as every other day in school does. I find it pointless to continue through this if you know your basic facts like in math. But no! They wanna make me miserable until I'm 18. I'm ANTI-COLLEGE too. lol. Well this weekend was pretty cool. Friday, "prom night" sucked though. My ex-boyfriend, Brendan, went with someone else to prom and I still care about him and everything. So while he was all kissing on his prom date M.C. I was wandering around being upset(ok I'll admit, I was kinda jealous). So, I was very happy to get home. Saturday my friend Britt and I went swimming in a pool then Curt came over *smiles*. Well from then on out I had a good weekend. Then on Sunday and Monday I talked to Liz and Jake. Liz, my dad's ex-girlfriend, and I talked alot. Jake, a guy that I absolutely love, is a sweetheart. I couldn't ask for a better guy to know. Matt is acting weird around me now. He won't talk and I don't think he really gives a fuck now. I duno what has changed but I hope it changes back. He's an awesome guy. But oh well. I haven't hurt myself lately, thankfully. Well that's all I have to say for now. Oh and Crystal chick, I love ya! Love to those that care, Mandy  P.S. I'll probably post some of my poetry on here too so B-E-W-A-R-E! lol.
