Stress Jim's Big Ego  Lyrics: Chorus: I'm Addicted to stress its the way that I get things done if I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long and I hang around like a bum and I think Im goin nowhere and that makes me nervous  Repeat  Everybodys out to get me but I feel alright Repeat x3 Everybodys thinkin bout me  (It's the little things that get you its the little things that get you when you werent payin' attention)  Repeat  Tryin to cut down on my caffeine consumption so when I get up I just have one cup of coffee and id like to have another cup of coffee with my breakfast and on the way to work I like to get a cup of coffee I like the kind of cup of coffee you get with your donuts but I never get the donut I just have the cup of coffee And when I get to work I have a cup of coffee cause I like a cup of coffee when im talking on the phone but it usually gets cold and I need to get another cup of coffee And its lunch, and I have an espresso  So when I get back its not morning anymore so I have a diet cola and another diet cola And by then I'm feelin fine im feelin pretty sharp and I'm feelin pretty wired and I'm gettin things done But right about 2 I get this little tiny micronim stuck behind my eyes and it moves to the back of my neck and it moves to the bottom of my spine but it doesnt get there til 5 or 6 o clock-- Which is the end of the day so I'm fine so I'm fine so I'm FINE-- Except when I have to work late....when I have to work late... which I usually do  Chorus  I love to work i love to run I love to play it real hard I love to steal little things from the grocery store-- like a piece of bubble gum or sometimes I just stick my thumb in a peach-- and leave it there I love to work I love to run I love to waterski snowboard jetski skydive parasail handglide rollerblade mountainbike bungee jump well I mean I'd love to do these things if I ever had the time I love to work I love to work I love to work right after work I love to spend a little time with this woman that I'm seein cause we never get the time to spend together-- so we call each other up and we talk about work But I think I'd really love is to get up by myself on a little tiny island in the middle of the ocean with just me, a book, and a cellular phone-- and a personel computer in case something came up and I'd eat and I'd drink and I'd run and I'd sleep and do nothing but swim all day-- Except I dont know how to do laps in the ocean...-- where are the sharks where are the SHARKS And theres this kind of anemone that sticks in your foot-- and the poison goes up to your brain and you DIE And sand fleas...SAND FLEAS yuck! But actually I think would be really relaxing just me by myself in the middle of the ocean and thats what Id really like to do more than anything else-- Except I'd probably hate it  Chorus mix
