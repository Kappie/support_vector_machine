The court was at pains to stress that they were not ruling on the issue of gay marriage, but simply noting that California law at present does not allow gay marriage, therefore the mayor can't marry gay couples:   We hold only that in the absence of a judicial determination that such statutory provisions are unconstitutional, local executive officials lacked authority to issue marriage licenses to, solemnize marriages of, or register certificates of marriage for same-sex couples, and marriages conducted between same-sex couples in violation of the applicable statutes are void and of no legal effect. Should the applicable statutes be judicially determined to be unconstitutional in the future, same-sex couples then would be free to obtain valid marriage licenses and enter into valid marriages. (hat tip:  urlLink Volokh Conspiracy )   That's good, I think.  Not because they invalidated gay marriage: I suppose I should care about gay marriage, but I really don't.  I do care about the rule of law, though, and the thing that bothers me most about the gay marriages in California is that they are against the law.  The mayor, a representative of the law, can hardly be claiming to give gay couples the protection of the law (i.e., legal marriage) when he is acting against the law, can he?  His defence was that he believes the California law against gay marriage is unconstitutional and thus he has no responsibility to uphold it.  But that is a very slippery-slope, and I'm glad---for the sake of the rule of law---that the California Supreme Court rejected that argument.
