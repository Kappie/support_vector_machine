An interesting exchange took place during the Democratic Presidential debate on Oct. 9, in which a questioner noted the help she has received from Pfizer in affording her prescription drugs, a point missed by a group of U.S. Democratic presidential candidates.   PHOENIX â€” The U.S. Democratic Party's presidential candidates met for their fourth debate here Thursday night. While attacks on the newest entry, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, won the most media attention, there was also an interesting exchange on the prescription drug issue.  In the segment of the program where audience members were allowed to ask questions, a stroke patient on a fixed income asked Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina what he would do about prescription drug costs for seniors.  Edwards asked the woman how much she spent per month on prescription medicines. Her answer was illuminating:  "I went on a Pfizer program, and that's why I can do it, I can afford it now....(it's) $51 that I pay. Before that it was 400 and some dollars a month."  Edwards, and other Democrats, missed the point that the woman's monthly prescription drug costs had declined more than 80 percent thanks to a Pfizer-sponsored program. Instead, Edwards slammed pharmaceutical companies, scoring them for alleged "price-gouging," "abusing the system," and being "monopolistic."
