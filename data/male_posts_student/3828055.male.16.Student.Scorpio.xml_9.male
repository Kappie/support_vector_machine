I'm going to write the actual lyrics. JBP didn't show up to rehearsal, and Jeff said, "dudes, I have this drum beat and I want it to be in a song." So he started playing it, and when Ben didn't have any ideas, I ran with it. It's pretty bitchin' song. I think we're going to use it to close on the 19th.  I wanted to write a song and call it ROAR right after Rosie attacked Coutts in that fateful game of football (which Rosie, Steph, Emily and I CONQUERED. That's right Teoh, we ruined you biatches!). It was supposed to be a nice, friendly game of touch football. Two-hand touch. I guess Rosie interpreted this as "two-hand shove Coutts onto the pavement as soon as he has the ball." She made him bleed. In two spots! You'd think Steph or myself would have been the one to hurt someone, seeing as we're used to rugby and all. But no, it was Rosie. She's a beast, that Rosie.  Gotta like that hustle though.  Anyhow it was right after that that I knew I had to write a song entitled ROAR. I predicted after that unprecedented attack that more would follow in a similar fashion; however, I was sadly mistaken. It seemed to be an isolated incident. Still, the idea intrigued me, and here we are. Hard rockin' as we are.  But, I digress. There are weightier matters to attend to today.  It's something I've mulled over quite a bit lately, and I found a good outlet for it this afternoon. First though, there's the matter of the Importance of Failure. We're all aware of it: our need to fail - while not as motivating in the later years as our need to succeed - is real. Sure we can learn without failing, but do we always truly comprehend? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, Shad taught me a very important dynamic of group work: that sometimes the failures can be more valuable than the successes. That's not to say that this was the  only  thing I learned from Shad - far from it - but in terms of how I live and work with others for the rest of my life, I think this is what will stick with me the longest.  I guess this really all comes down to the way that Green House developed as a team and formed into a cohesive unit. Storytime, here we come.  The first week of Shad. We'd had a few minor successes as a group, the Mini-Project being the most obvious. We were beginning to gel as a group. When asked to describe how we worked together, the words "group dynamic" and "great" or "awesome" often came up in the same sentence. We thought we were pretty good, and coming together nicely. Besides, we hadn't made  any one from our House cry, and that was better than some of the other Houses could say.  Then came the camping trip.  Incorporated into the camping trip was a 2-day course run by Jim Ongena of  urlLink Corporate Heights . Part of that 2-day course was a series of 4 tasks that each House had to complete. You had a certain amount of time to complete each task. After that time had expired, the group would sit down and discuss its performance with whoever was running the task (some Shad staffer). Green House managed to complete 0/4 tasks. It was quite the eye-opening experience.   I think I learned more about myself and Green House in those 2 days than I did in the entire rest of the month. Hell, make that the past 3 years.  More later. Maybe.  Toodle-loo from the basement, - Cary (Donut O)
