I cant imagine myself being deprived of a computer for more than a week or two. Anyway, the modem isnt like as fast as the Opt Online, but i dunno, maybe im just not 'feeling' it. Im gonna try out a bandwidth test right now...    1.6 megabits per second. Whoa... ew... Slow as crap. I figured it would be that low :(... I had a maximum of 10.0 MBit on Opt. Online using a Cat5 ;\... Blah oh well..    Right now ive been going through some hardships. My attitude is growing more and more against my mother because shes a weirdo and i dont like her a lot. I feel as if she really does not even care that she has another child, aka me. Im just gonna idle on IRC and talk to some friends and visit some sec sites for updates...
