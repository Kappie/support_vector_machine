Then I walked up to the pool and bought a candy bar and a cup of water. We should not have to pay for a cup of water. But it was good water so I really can't complain. Then I came home and went to Krogers with my dad and brother. And then just played outside and talked to my dad. And really thats all I did. Everyone is going to Kings Island tomorrow. Andrew says I should sneek into one of his carry on bags. But, I don't know getting up at 3:30 in the morning to make it up to the school by 4 AM doesn't sound to appleasing. Thats why I didn't go in the first place. But I have to get up early tomorrow still. 7:00 at least not 4:00. I'm volunteering at my churches Vacation Bible School. So I get to help little kids learn about the Bible. So that should be good. Maybe I'll go to hollands afterwards or something with KLT and Haley. I'm doing that all week though so it should be fun. Today was the 60th Anniversery of D-Day. So that's cool. Well, I need to go get ready to go to bed or I won't be able to get up tomorrow. Good Night!
