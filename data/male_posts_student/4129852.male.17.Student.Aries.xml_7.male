When he was 3 he cracked his dad over the head with a frying pan When he was 5 he gave his 14 year old brother Ryan a black eye At the ripe age of 10 he was hospitalized for 2 months and almost died once and actually dies once. it was the most inriching feeling he had ever had waking the morning afetr even though he didn't know what had happened he just felt wonderful. At the age of 12 he left the country be himself for the first time on a plane to Cali to see his sister Stephanie, it was a wonderful experience. Age 14 he went to high scholl and fell in love for the first time. Unfortunatly she was a drug addict and got pregnant with her dealers baby then lost it cause of drugs... so we wont talk about her much. Age 15 he fell in love again and lost his virginity to a lovely girl who he still loves Trista she is one of his best girlfriends ever. he finds he loves anything sexual wether it be pleasuring a girl or being pleasured he quikly learns all he can about pleasuring a woman. Age 16 he meats one of the coolest guys ever Jay Vanderheart or "jesus" he is one of his best friends ever he teaches him indirectly how to live life and not be afraid when you dont need to be.
