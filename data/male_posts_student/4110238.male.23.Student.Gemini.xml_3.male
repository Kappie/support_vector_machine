I'm actually ready for school to start...I even bought my books today, and reserved a locker at Gregory Gym.  I want to get r-i-p-p-e-d.  Is that so much to ask?  This is the semester I'm gonna get my shit together.  I swear.  Today's highlights include:  *A great chat with Braden, to whom I confessed my undying love and devotion.  He took it in stride...  *Shopping with Lena...but why the hell didn't I buy anything?  *Hearing Jill's awesome, hott (that's hot with  two  Ts) story.  That was good stuff.  Tomorrow I'm going to see Outfoxed (if we get tickets) to learn about the evil ways of super-villain Rupert Murdoch.  Then on Sunday I'm gonna see...Howard Dean!  In person!  How freaking exciting is that?*  *Caution: level of dorkiness is ORANGE, or "elevated."
