Well, he in the top 5 of my "Hot Guys" list. I'm not joking. He acts, he plays piano, he wears glasses, he does TV stuff. In short, he's really, really, really super hot. Not just hot, cute. That's a lethal combo, hot and cute. If I had to sum up the perfect guy that I'd date in a snap, it would be him. Plus, he listens to Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Sarah Brightman; and just last week quoted a line from  Gypsy . If a picture is worth a thousand words, then be warned.      Derrick is on the far right. Seth is on the far left (he's a cutie too), and I can't remember the girls name... she used to work for Channel One, or still does. Obviously I don't pay attention to her.        Derrick again. Isn't he just so cute?!
