Nick Berg got his head cut off. Very plain, no mess about the actually lexicon - it seems like a very subdued way to expire. It isn't. This isn't some sort of Tarantino-esque jaunt through moral degredation; these men pick on someone who had little or nothing to do with their grievance and punished him for their own frustrations. To top it all off, instead of taking responsibility for this "bold act" (as I'm sure they've termed it), they've hidden their head behind scarves and balaclavas. Cowards.  What the hell is wrong with these people? I don't mean muslims and and I don't mean Iraqis. I mean the folks in this world who readily do what we would term as "Evil" unto those around them. What is it about the middle east that provokes people to turn to arms so quickly? Even in the 18th and 19th centuries North Americans were slow to anger (though the violence burned brightly when ignited).   What of peaceful protests? What of quiet defiance? What of simply going about your business? It would seem to me that rebuilding your shattered nation after thirty years of dictatorship and a handful of wars would be a more beneficial goal. It shames me to share genetic code with these bastards.  Is it something to do with Islam? How is it that there are some who practice what they call Islam who have been so devoured by hate? I really don't understand why they feel they must destroy and kill - either the Jews or Westerners. I could devoutly not give a toss if I met one of these chaps down a dark alley - in fact, I'd tip my hat, wish him a mighty fine evening and go about my business. Why is his business killing me?  If it comes down to a Darwinian "Us or Them" I am resolute in the belief that it will be us. However, why does this problem exist at all? It's the one thing, the most important thing that I don't comprehend regarding Middle Eastern Politics. No one has really gone over "why" they hate us - just who and how they hate us. In the movies terrorists have demands - we barely hear from these people. Even Cobra Commander was more communicative than these swines.  Fuck em. The problem with the American's right now is that they're not hitting back hard enough. The Israelies have a lovely technique - track down who was responsible for a given crime and WIPE OUT their entire family. A genetic line, erased. Slowly but sure we'll get to the point where no one can be bothered to hurt each other any more.  That or we all die.
