(Well, in fact, none at all, but I've seen the main actor appear in a couple more recent movies.) I read somewhere that apparently  urlLink Life of Brian  is said to be one of the funniest of their movies, and I must say it IS pretty hilarious. I've also heard  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail  is excellent, and I'm guessing it is since IMDB rates it an 8.4/10.
