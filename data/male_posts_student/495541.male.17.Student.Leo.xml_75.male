Football rolls around, and whoops I don't have a practice jersey.  I'm screwed.  Luckily I borrowed an old one from the equiptment office.  So I stick out [even] more with this green jersey while everyone else of course has white.  I'm not the only one to forget, but somehow I'm the only one to get the annoying green jersey.  Hmm.  Anyway, I get out of football early for drivers ed like normal.  I go up to the room, walk in and no one is there except a few people.  All the rest of the chairs were up so I figured it was a teacher conference.  I rememered from last week how the teacher said that we'd have class 7-9 on the 15th (which was to be a conference day).  I thought maybe he got the date wrong or something so I just headed home, thinking I'd come back at 7 and stay until 9:15.  So I walk home, get some food and come back at exactly 7 and notice everyone is already there and the teachers in the middle of a discussion about parking.  Oops.  Right.  I can't describe how stupid that feeling is.  The problem is that I thought I was fine and that the class would just be at 7.  I was wrong.  Class wasn't too bad though.  I mean it was only an hour for me and I noticed he took attendance after I got there and never said a word to me about being late.  That was the only upside, I guess.  I was just working on a project here for the site.  A photo essay about me moving into my brother's old room.  I'm kind of excited about the idea.  I've never done anything like it and it's interesting I think.  Maybe I'll get some new visitors.  Other than the few pictures of the room, I haven't taken many pictures lately.  I really don't have any time.  Overall, I guess my day wasn't that bad.  I just make it seem bad, maybe.  That's all I've got to say for now.  Good night.
