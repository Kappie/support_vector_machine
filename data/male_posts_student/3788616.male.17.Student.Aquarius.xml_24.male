Thanks Chris... you're a pal! heex... yeah well... unfortunately though, my back still ain't feeling that much better... damn it lah... i don't know how long it'll take... but... i will perservere and keep going on, praying... so that with HIS help, and with me doing my part, i will get better soon...  Indeed today as i headed down to church, i realised alot of things. There is so much that i don't know, so much that i can learn about GOD. I once thought that there wasn't much to being a Christian, just needing to read the bible, go church and be a goody too shoes... but... i am wrong... in life, you don't have to be a goody too shoes, but... rather, there is so much more... there was a question posed to us today, and it made me reflect... are the things or rules/goals that the church set for us, human-centered or more GOD centered? ever thought about that? i never did, not till today that is...  I realise that many of the things that we think, much of what the orders given to us are more human-centered than being GOD-centered! Is this right? if not, how do we change our ways? how do we truly move towards a more GOD-centered lifestyle? Let's take a time to think of 1 example or question each... I pose this question, are the goals and rules that we follow according to what the church laid down for us, buman-centered or GOD-centered? Thought about it? And... are we following it cause it's the RIGHT thing to do? Or is it cause we really want to glorify the LORD'S name? Think about it? and perhaps pose your comments...  Anyway, it's surprising what you can find out with each brand new day... Such as today when i learnt new things about my close friends Chelsea... yup... not meant for me to say nor divulge, but i've learnt many things... even, friends whom i've known for years... with each day, i learn more about them! so... what have you found out today? we are all on are road of discovery...  Ok... i have finally figured out whom i really feel for.. but... i shall divulge it when i am more confident of doing so in future... till then... Take care and keep smiling! :p
