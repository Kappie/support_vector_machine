I am also a student in Directing at the moment, but I'm not really a Director. Today, according to an old professor of mine, marks the first day that I can truly call myself an Actor. I am an Actor. It feels good to say it. My first theatre professor in college told us that we are not actors until we've done it for ten years, and only if we've also done it outside of an academic setting. Only then are we experienced enough. Only then do we earn the title.   Well, on this day in 1993, I made my stage debut outside of the academic world in Aurand Harris' A Toby Show , a play set in the vaudeville era that retells the Cinderella Story with a Southern twist. I played the title character, Toby, a country bumpkin ranch hand who narrated the play and acted as the fairy godmother to the would-be princess. So, it was community theatre, and it was a shitty play. Either way, it opened the door for me, and I'm thankful. I'm sure Anthony Hopkins first gig wasn't playing Richard III in the West End. I'm sure he started out with a Toby. Hey, atleast my first real theatre experience wasn't playing an extra or a bit part like so many others. I was the lead!   Ten years and about 25 roles later, I have earned my wings. I am officially a professional Actor. While I am going to continue on in the MFA Directing Program, I will consider myself an Actor first and foremost. I've actually started auditioning for roles in the city. I'm acting in a workshop production for Triangle Productions this summer (just so that I can get an opportunity to direct one of my favorite plays there in November), I've got callbacks scheduled for the Northwest Children's Theatre season, and I'm doing PATAs in August to audition for all of the Portland Area Theatre Directors. I blew away Triangle and Northwest Children's Theatre with my auditions, and I will do the same for PATAs.   Very soon, I will be a gainfully employed professional actor with regular gigs. I'm also joining an agency, because It's time I started taking the steps to live my dream instead of settling for something that will give me a little more security. I'm tired of seeing people my age make it in the business when I am confident that I have just as much passion and talent to do the same. The difference between me and Hollywood actors my type is that they've gotten off their asses and taken some risks to get where they are. I've got to start doing the same if I ever want to get out from in front of the TV and get in front of a TV camera. Call me crazy, call me cheesy, but I want to be a comic television actor with a successful series, variety or sitcom. Yeah, so it's no art house, Independent, fine film. Fuck that! I want to use my god-given talents to make people laugh and enjoy themselves atleast once a week, 5 times a week once we're in syndication!....
