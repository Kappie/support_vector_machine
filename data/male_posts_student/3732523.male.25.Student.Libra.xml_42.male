Somewhat embarassing for me, as I have now been living in Europe for 4 years. So I will have to leave my "comfort zone" of German-speaking Europe for that strange uncivilized south coast of England. I am sure they are no longer running around in purple paint as the Romans found them 2000 years agoor so ;)  Anyways, I feel a lot better now that I have finally gotten a ticket. I plan to go with my fellow Swiss residents, Reethi and Sunshine, both of which are Bomo veterans and should know how to deal with things unknown to me such as trains that are not on time ;). Hmm.. I shall have to get a few pounds (the money type) as well.  It will only be four days, but I think I should get the "core Bomo" experience. All of the previous meets I have been to have been on the European continent. As most of the attendees were from the UK, they have always been sort of "tourist meets," in which visits to the nearby tourist destinations have been one of the key attractions. I think Bomo will be different. For me, of course, just going to England will be fascinating.   I have had many a chance to go to England before, including an offer of a "free trip" thanks to the generosity of a woman who was "desperate" for company, but like an idiot, always turned them down (partly because of pressure from my father who thought England would be no challenge as they speak "English".  So now that my credit card is charged, it looks like I better go..!
