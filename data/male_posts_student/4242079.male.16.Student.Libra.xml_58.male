     
       I dreamt of a fever, one that would cure me of this cold, winter-set heart With heat to melt these frozen tears and burn with reasons as to carry on Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow But I swear that I would follow anything- just get me out of here But you get six months to adapt and you get two more to leave town And in the event that you do adapt we still might not want you around But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose but I know that's impossible now And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories 'cause I just can't think anymore about that or about her tonight And I give myself three days to feel better or else I swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff because if I can't learn to make myself feel better then how can I expect anyone else to give a shit? I scream for the sunlight or a car to take me anywhere. just get me passed this dead and eternal snow 'cause I swear that I'm dying. Slowly, but it's happening and if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere just take me there and say and lie to me and say it's gonna be alright.    --Bright Eyes
