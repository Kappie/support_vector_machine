Trying to experience a feel at being a camera man for once. Neway, I do not feel as stress out as yesterday, but i still feel that I be taking a break after the youth mass 1st event ends. I dunno, I juz feel that I really need the break. Hmm... Oral exam coming, sop must maintain the voice if not sure cannot take the test 1. So I do hope that things go well. Ah, gttta go.
