The morning built to the crescendo of the pounding in my ears as I signed out, to go home, put on my black tie and walk to St. Mary's, the most important single building in my life. To pay respect to the closest man to me. The church was packed, full of people who had never come to St. Mary's, full of people who loved John in their own way. I silently stepped up the aisle, taking my place with the rest of the choir. In particular on my side were John Blackwell, who has been in the choir for about 40 years or something; Timothy Brain, Gloucestershire Chief Constable and choir-member for a couple of years; Richard Brain, a stocky sort of fellow who has been with the choir for about 4 years; Someone who I'm not sure of but I recognise from as far back as 7 years ago; and, most importantly, Matthew Kingston, who knew St. Mary's for as long as John had. Holding back tears, I sang with Richard the hymn, but was unable to stop the steady flow of fluid during the psalm. The only person who seemed to be similarly afflicted was Tamsyn, who has been an uncommited choir member for around 4 years. The choir was right to question the use of Lead Kindly Light, as no-one knew it and it destroyed what was a very emotional build-up. During the last hymn, however, I felt the cool slide of the tears against my cheek, singing the unison at full volume. Processing out with the rest of the choir, we struggled in our attempt not to break down and cry right there. Outside, we formed a guard of honour, watching the coffin of such a great man pass us by. It was only then I realised that Matthew Kingston had cried as much as I.  In the vestry, words were slow, calm, painful to make. Sam turned to face me, and although I had meant to say something comforting about Marcus (she had been troubled by his abscence from school) I got out as fast as I could. I wept long and hard as I trudged home, only comparable to times in the past. Times long gone, while I was a treble. Richard put it well when he said that there were "all the generations of Mr. Yarnley's choirmastery" present.  Love, Jon Roskilly
