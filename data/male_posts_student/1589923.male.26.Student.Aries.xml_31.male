My good fren has already given up hope of trying in SG and he told me that he would very much head to down under and try his luck. He was saying i have a good opportunity of trying my luck in Oz since i am already pursuing my studies here. This is not an easy decision to make. So much so that sometimes i dun know what i want anymore. Was looking thru some pilot training brochures and was very much tempted with the course. If only i have an extra 4.5K... i can easily get a Private license which i am sure will no doubt boost my chance. It's like a dream that's forever hanging in the air and i am having difficulty reaching it. I was thinking about my fren who's currently in France.... on his way to becoming a fighter pilot. Life is certainly unfair. And another of my Indian fren who got thru the interview with SQ and in the process of signing the contract. I'm not being sour grapes here. I just can't figure out why is it that ppl around me seem to have it so much easier than i do? is there something that i lack? Is there certain X-factor that i have not yet attained?
