If you crash without a helmet, a concussion is likely. First Shayl, now my sister.  You shouldn't make excuses such as, "they look ugly", because they don't. And anyway, wearing plastic is better than having a damn concussion.  Why am I being constantly attacked by wave after wave of popup ads, popunder ads, and shitty programs that keep installing themselves?!
