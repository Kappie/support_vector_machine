Well, I'm that bored right now. It is so boring at my house. My mom is at a conference, and my dad is sick.  Today has been, needless to say, BORING. I went to the store with my dad about 9:30 to get three things: shampoo, trash bags, and cough medicine for my dad. It took us like 15 minutes to find the stupid trash bags. They were down the aisle with canned soup. Why? I don't know. Leave it to Food 4 Less to amaze us all.   No one is online. Everyone is out of town. Stefani is working, and I have no license to take the car anywhere. I get to go pick up my car on Monday though, which is good. Stefani is gonna come over and help me move the fountain, which is concrete, to the backyard so we can make room in the garage for my car. I want these accessories for my car. What do you think?       All green of course. What else? Lol. Well I'm gonna go for now. I may write more today.  Please save me from my boredom!
