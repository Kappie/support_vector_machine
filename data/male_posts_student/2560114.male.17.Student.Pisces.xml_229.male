I got a few aces, the other team made a lot of errors on their part, it was goin alright...the 2nd game though was a whole different story. We lost like 13-25, which was horrid...it seemz that when we win the 1st match, it gives us an excuse to play not as hard as we did in the 1st game...sorta like cuttin a lil slack. then the 3rd game i think we lost 7-15...overall, i think they were a good team, we jus had to play consistantly...our passes were a lil off and we jus needed to put the ball away... 2nd match  of the day, we had to plya asics mavs from probly texas, not sure though. The 1st game we jus get killed i think 13-25, and it happened again in the 2nd game...my hits were shit, like we were basically out of sync...then the 3rd match of the day we had to play the 4th(last) seeded team, cincinatti attack 18-2, from...cincinatti...uh duh!...anywayz, the 1st game we smashed them 25-13, everyone was doin a good job...then some how, that let down factor of ours jus came into effect...we lost the 2nd game 22-25...then we lost the 3rd game 13-15...it was jus the worse feelin ever...so basically we're not goin to play in the gold, silver, and bronze division and even flight 1 or 2...the most we can get is 3...3 ppl! 3!!!!...so its wack to the max...my feelin the whole day was, jus try to do ur job and then everything will somehow come...like a year ago, i jus thought "if i got a kill, then im spent!"...now i know i can get the kills, i jus have to b consistant and take it to the next level...i jus havent had a game this season that i was really really into it...the only game that i remember me bein sooooo into it, out of both club seasons and high school, is the game against camarillo at home...but since then im jus not like all giddy about vball...i jus need to find someway to get me back in that mode...but if we're losin, it jus sucks cuz i hate to lose...PERIOD!...its the lamest thing ever...well close to it...but yeah. I jus need to b more consistant and hit the ball harder...i jus have to work on that over the summer i guess...well my plans now is hopefully goin to c the us national team play russia and talkin to my g/f...payce
