Anonymous: you're a hypocrit Anonymous: hollister is a multi million dollar company Anonymous: so even though your shirt may cost 30 bucks, you may as well just buy a nissan, b/c theres no difference  Hmm...Nissan/ T-shirt...$30,000/ $30?  Not seeing a big similarity here.  Hollister makes $25ish from one shirt that I buy.  Nissan on the other hand makes at least $2500 on each of their cars.  My buying of a couple shirts doesn't add up to even one car being sold.  I don't know about you, but I think a car is a much bigger investment than a T-shirt.      Anonymous: most gas stations dont have u.s. gas, so walk if you dont like it  This is true.  Few gas stations actually do us domestic petroleum.  The entire point of my previous post was to inform my readers about where oil companies get their gas and what countries the company itself is based in.    One of the biggest reasons oil companies don't use American oil is because we don't have enough refineries to process it domestically.  Why don't we just build more refineries you ask?  Simple, the Democrats and liberals in congress won't allow it.      Anonymous: and chevrolets aren't made in the usa Anonymous: like you want to think Anonymous: parts come from all over the world  This is partially true and very misleading.  It is true in the sense that there are no 100% American made cars.  All Ford motor company cars are assembled in America and nearly all are made from over 80% American parts.  Not perfect but a heck of a lot better than Nissan and Hyundai.  To directly refute Anonymous' point, the GM owned Chevrolet company, builds the Astro Van, S10 pickup, and Silverado (just to name a few) in the US from over 90% American made parts.    Generally, if you want an American made car, buy a Ford or a GM product like Chevy, Oldsmobile, or Saturn.      Anonymous: know your shit  I do actually research the stuff I write before I post it on the internet.  Although I do love making these posts debunking the comments I get on AIM.
