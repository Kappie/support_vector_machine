I seem to have an attraction for unsung heroes. Like Robbie Dougan, everyone knows clubbed to death but few would take the time to find out who the artist is, I like others did. Well chuck Jones was a major force in Warner bros. Looney tunes. A masterpiece of animation. People admire the simpsons for the fact that jokes are ironic, one side of the joke is funny to the children, like Bart running into a trash can, but adults appreciate jokes about the republicans. A two-edged sword. You know, for young and old and in between. So, Looney tunes was the first sort of animation to utilize such humor. I mean in comparison Disney is shit. M-I-c-k-e-y can just fuck off. The depth and humor of bugs bunny is exponentially w00t. Disney is good too, but; its cute funny, not witty.  I grew up on these cartoons, and I'm glad I did, they were really something, classics. Better than today's jap anime shit like Pokemon. Even at that age one could appreciate the artistic value of each cartoon, the music was perfectly orchastrated, building mood; the animation was clever and vivid, and the jokes and gags were certainly familiar and predictable after the 30 consecutive cartoon, I got TAPES of the stuff. But it was golden. It was always funny, it always be funny. Universal Eternal.   Chuck Jones. Did NOT start Warner bros. He did NOT make Porky pig, Elmer fudd and the other old school WB characters. But he did create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester  tweety, Road runner  coyote. You know. All the combinations. Yosamite Sam, and the jedi pimp Pepe le pew (the greatest lover to ever grace the silver screen; and off the screen, nes pa?) Chuck had been cartooning way before his invovlement in WB, he made a few groundbreaking animation pieces before thinking up that wascally wabbit.   Bugs and Daffy were his pet characters. HE once remarked, that Bugs is everything he wanted to be, smart, kind, witty, all around good guy. But Daffy was what he was, arrogant, envious, irritable. In fact he admires that daffy openly embraces his faults and just runs with them.  Chuck also asserts that all of us have a bit of daffy  bugs within us in that regard. Chuck was always a joker; he got his kicks making everyone laugh, and he was good at it too! His goal would always to have everyone laughing, its a good goal. And by watching those cartoons, I think he achieved that goal. Hats off to Chuck. ;)
