I don’t want to know the whole truth; I want to know part of it because there’s a significantly smaller amount of truth in the biased truth. How much information out there is biased towards Bush? Hmm? Not very much! Why read  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  (which actually adds up to millions) of articles out there against Bush? I mean, everybody and his brother, American or not, has written something against Bush. First of all, it seems like a time wasting subject anyway, so why waste time reading millions of things against Bush when you can read one thing for him? There you go, time saved on political crap, go to Chipotle and buy two burritos and hide them in the park outside my house (don’t worry, I’ll find them).
