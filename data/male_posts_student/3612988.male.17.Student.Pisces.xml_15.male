It din sound really nice to me initially cos i think that its just too noisy for me. however after i've seen the lyrics. i'm really touched lor!  the song is written by this guy who is a bad teenager lor. he's got a broken family. his mother have to work till very late in the night and his father is always drunk. often he would would up in the middle of the night jus to hear his parents quarrel. He hated school and in the end gotten caught by the police for his crime. he written this song whilst in jail. it's about his life. how he has smoke till his lungs turn black, his girlfriend doing oral sex on another guy, and all sorts of rubbish that can happen to a gangster...(http://www.zheteng.com/ttt/lifeview.htm ) some time, i feel that we are too fortunate to be living in such a nice environment that we tend to forget that there are people out there who are left behind by the society to fend for themselves.....  yUP...going play soccer later ...jus behind my house...at 4pm!!
