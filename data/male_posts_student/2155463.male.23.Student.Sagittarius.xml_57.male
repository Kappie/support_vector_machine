It didn't work when I first opened it, but I thought that was probably on account of the derelict battery it came with (this was  beyond  a generic type).  So I go out and get new batteries - and it still doesn't work.  Of course, I've lost the receipt, so now I'm stuck with a flashlight that doesn't work and I can't take it back...grr....looks like another piece of junk sitting around my room.  Oh, and since I'm throwing up miscellany, there's two guys outside my window having a pretty good argument right now...looks like one of them hit the other guy's SUV with his rental truck...yeah, they're definitely goin at it - I can hear it through my window (which is pretty thick)...oh, there's the cops (this is kind of a running account) - looks like things are gonna settle down a little...yep, things are pretty well under control now (darn), looks like I gotta go back to getting some work done...  Oh, speaking of work...we're getting new computers! :-D  This is an exciting thing for me (despite that fact that I won't hardly get to use them)...the one I'm using now is pretty old, so it's gonna be nice to have one of those cool new ones (especially since it has one of those flat-screen monitors).
