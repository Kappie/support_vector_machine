I'll be completely honest - this assignment had me on the ropes. I didn't really know what I was going to talk about, and I didn't really make a solid outline before hand, so I kinda winged it during one frantic night of caffeine-fueled typing.  When all was said and done, I was left with 4 pages of what could be considered  pure bullshit  or  pure genius . There really was no middle-ground, as far as I could see. Now that I've received my mark, I can officially declare that it was pure  genius ...or a level of bullshit so incomprehensible that my professor had no choice but to reward the ballsy endeavour with an equally absurd mark: 19.5/20.0    Currently listening to: Bush - Monkey
