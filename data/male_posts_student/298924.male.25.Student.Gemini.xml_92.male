I neglected to make note earlier but it IS worth noting that two of my closest friends at Morehouse have each won the two most powerful positions in the SGA....congrats go out to Randall Woodfin the SGA President-elect and L. Jared "Squire" Boyd the SGA Vice President-elect.....SVR boys!!  In other news....I have an OSCE today....I am a sorry dude because I forgot what that stands for but I CAN tell you that it is a skills assessment that is a component of my Physical Diagnosis class....to further elaborate I must go from room to room and perform a section for 15 minutes of a sample patient interview as directed by a proctor....  Got tests next week, and for the first time in a while I feel halfway prepared for them....I plan to really study hard this weekend so that I can make up some ground for the tests that I flubbed earlier this semester....  I have kept this area sports free for a long while, so I am waaaay overdue for my commentary....  Baseball season has started and I'm a happy camper....the Braves have scored 20 runs in three games....Barry Bonds has 4 home runs in 3 games...if things keep up at this pace it will be a great season!!.....In basketball things are pretty much unfolding how I expected them to....people should keep a close eye on this Shaq situation....if he is hurt, watch out!!.....the Kings, Mavs, or even (ugh) Spurs could all sneak into the Finals and make noise....I wouldn't want to play any of those three....  The NCAA Final Four was really cool for me....my little sister was able to attend Saturday's games....we both had a particularly keen interest in the games because her friend AJ Moye played a key role in Indiana's success....next year our neighbor "Lil Earl" (he's not so little anymore) will be playing Division 1 ball at some major school (the school he mentioned to me as being in the lead is a preseason top 10)....as if I needed another reason to follow college basketball closely, now I have even more interest....  I don't know if I mentioned it before or not but my high school alma mater won the Georgia 4-A Championship this season losing only one game in the process....the aforementioned "Lil Earl" was on that squad...congrats to them!  Anyway time to wash off and smell good!!....sometime later I will talk about my new found obsession with body washes and colognes....but not now!!!  Peace
