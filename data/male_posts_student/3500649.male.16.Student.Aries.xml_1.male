Well, a bit shocked, for Sasi’s dad wasn’t handsome at all. What the hell is genetics work –Sasi just doesn’t inherit a piece of appearance from his dad. As I wait at the gate 4 my dad, once again, I saw him. His dad was talking to a friend  I overheard a fragment of their conversation. He wasn’t really happy at Sasi’s result. On the other hand, Sasi bade a polite greeting 2 that auntie. ( I hate that – being polite to your friend’s mums  earn their favours? )
