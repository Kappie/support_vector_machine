I never thought that anyone would bother to read this blog yet people have commented on some of my previous posts and to know that I'm atleast reaching some people out there makes me feel a lot better.  I honestly think that putting forward everything I've ever kept inside onto this blog is doing me more good than the weeks of therapy I've already been through and I hope that this carries on until I can finally feel happy with my life again.  So thanks to anyone out there who's reading this, you couldn't possibly imagine how much you're helping.
