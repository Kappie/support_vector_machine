Well, today's tip is exactly how you can do that, and it's actually quite simple.  This is the easiest tip of the day that I've had to write so far, so, hopefully it'll sound a little better than Saturdays, which confused me even.  1. Open Mozilla Firefox from your desktop, quick launch, or whatever. 2. Go go Tools>Options. 3. Under the general tab, you'll see a text box named "Location(s)." 4. Type the URL of the first tab you want to open automatically. 5. Put a | right after it, with no spaces.  (To do that character, hold SHIFT and press the \ button, which is right above the enter button) 6. Now, type the second URL for the second tab, and then do the | again. 7. Keep doing that until you have all the tabs set.  8. Hit Okay, and then close Mozilla Firefox. 9. Reopen it, and you'll see that all the URLS that you typed in are now showing up as different tabs, already loaded for you.   urlLink    After each URL that you type, make a | symbol and type the next one. urlLink      urlLink    And, the end result...these tabs opened automatically when I opened Firefox. urlLink    ---------------------------- June 28, 2004: Wrap Up  I hope you guys are just as surprised as I am.  2 hours ago, I would have never thought that I would be getting ready to start my first contest, and, now, I'm already planning the full details of it.  Today, I announced the "bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway," which you can find out more about in today's Site of the Day, or at the top of the sidebar.  However, I will be mixing it up to make it a little harder, so that you guys read more of the posts on the site.  That will start whenever I get invites.  So, just chill, and check occasionally, and it will eventually come.  Other than that, I thought that everything I reviewed was good, except for that MyAlbum crap, but, you won't want that anyway.    Today, in games, I looked at Family Feud on Uproar.  It's a great game to play with friends during school, and, even if you're by yourself, its still pretty fun.  Family Feud got a shockingly good  4.5 out of 5.   For today's download of the day, we looked at MyAlbum, and also Mozilla Firefox, since I gave out my first crap score.  MyAlbum has lots of customization features, but, that's not enough to make it difficult to use, and not to mention, the pictures look bad when you view your slideshow.  MyAlbum got a  2 out of 5.   Mozilla Firefox, on the other hand, is Mozilla's next generation browser.  It also has lots of customization features, and these are easy to use.  It's a tabbed browser, so you won't have to have so many windows open at the same time when online.  You can skin it, it's got a fast download system, and its the perfect browser.  Mozilla Firefox 0.9 received an elite  5 out of 5.   Today's site of the day was Gmail, from Google.  This new email service is fast, offers 1 GB of space, and is from the same people that brought you Froogle and other odd tools.  1 GB allows for bigger attachments, archiving, and more.  It's definitely the best free email service out there, and it is worth the elusive  6 out of 5.   And finally, today's tip, shown above, is for Mozilla Firefox.  We looked at how you can set your homepage to load your favorite web pages.  It was simple, where you would go into options, and in the locations text box, type the URL of each tab you want to open, following each one with a | symbol.  That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Tomorrow, I'm going to take a look at another Mozilla product, Mozilla Thunderbird, which is the perfect replacement for Microsoft Outlook.  I'll also take a look at another game on Uproar, and feature GameRankings as the site of the day.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for 2 updates, and I'll see you back here tomorrow for another fun-filled day of bagel.tech.  Also, I'm picking up Spiderman 2: The Game tomorrow, so don't mind me if my updates are rushed.
