I am going to be joining forums with  urlLink Nick Elder , The Universal Geek by this December to January.  The Univeral Geek + GeekNet = The New GeekNet  Doesn't really compute, but I will be registering the domain, etc, etc. so I wll decide the domain name and site name.  Nick has agreed on the name, so I see no problem...  The reason I have decided to do this is because I need someone else to help me with the big tech community I want to create...  I really won't have time to do it on my own when school starts back.  I really hope I will be able to get a domain by the end of this year, but if I can't, I will stay with TK and Freewebs for as long as possible  But, I must admit, I'm very tired of the current design I have with Freewebs/Geocities and I can't use Yabb or PHPbb with it so I can't have my blog powered by PHPbb or Yabb... or can I?  I'll play with it... If I can't get a domain and I get the forums up on tk, It'll be geeknet.tk.
