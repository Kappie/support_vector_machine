I just hope my words may still find refuge in your heart.  	Our past.  ‘Tis the sweetest and most amorous blend of harmony between two hearts whose beats form the perfect music of a world only seen above the sky.  ‘Tis a gift that gave me a peace that is absent from my being.  ‘Tis the time I felt life, heaven, you.  And I cherished it with all the vitality I have left.  It gave me the strength to withstand the raging tides, the hope to see something fruitful in the days to come.  And ironically, our past gave me a future to hold on, to dream on.  It gave me all of these because it is the only entity in my life where I can find your love.  	Time does not heal wounds; it worsens them.  And I have my heart to prove it.  Many times, I tried to find someone to suffice my longing for your return, and many times, I thought I succeeded.  But every time I found one, the scars of the past kept going back, and every time that happens, the pain deepens.  It has become so deep that only my wounded but hoping heart could sustain my soul’s existence.  	Betrayal.  I have betrayed myself, my love and you, by trying to replace a love so pure and so true to another love that has yet to define its essence.  I’m sorry.  	I deserve my loneliness.
