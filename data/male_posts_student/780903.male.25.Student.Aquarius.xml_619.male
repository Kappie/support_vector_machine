The first sentence of the story reads as follows, except the words in bold are my own additions, not in the actual article:  "Wherever there's been some law, some change in attitude, lawyers have been at the forefront of that, defining individual liberties, defining people's rights... and defining people's right to live in peace," declared  movie actor and star of "Angels in the Outfield"  Danny Glover to a captivated audience on September 10 at this academic year's first Saturday School Event.  Later in the article:  "I'm glad to pay taxes," Glover , who has a heck of a lot of money, and probably doesn't notice the difference,  declared as he explained his belief that taxes provide for "those who are incapable of providing for themselves."
