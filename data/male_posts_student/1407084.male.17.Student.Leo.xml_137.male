I was batting in the batting cages(this was back when I used to play baseball) with my coach pitching. I kept swinging at the oncoming balls but I had a very low hit ratio.. it was like 1 in 5 or 1 in 6 balls that i would hit, and usually the ones I hit didn't go very far. Well there was this one kid outside the cage who kept ridiculing me because I couldn't hit the ball. The coach started yelling at him and he said "When you hit every ball pitched to you, you can begin to criticize his batting". I don't know why, but that stuck in my mind.
