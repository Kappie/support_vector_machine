I'm now uploading the MP3 of my Compose  Play piece from Thursday  It better not be fucking raining tomorrow morning - I have to pedal to uni with a huge-arsed DAT machine case on my back, which leaves me  no  room for any books or anything... Bloody Richard (the tech. guy) was  35 minutes late  today - this meant that I had to ride home in peak hour - I was waiting at one intersection for ten minutes before a suitable gap appeared in the traffic... just to get to the middle of the road!  Razor burn sucks
