Kok Wei enuf of this crap if not i would always show u the scout salute..and of coz i'll ask u to read b/w the fingers..(oops, BP pls forgive me for such dirty thoughts...a scout must be clean in thought and word and deed..i guess i haben reached that yet). anyway dudes it has been long since iupdate my blog coz i've been doing tutorials ahead esp for maths..and preparing for the korea jamboree trip. i'll be leaving tml..eh no today..haas coz its 0020hrs now..haas..yupx..i'm leaving at 2335hrs...but will be reaching the airport at terminal 1. jay chou's album is released today..haas..haben went to collect the CD that i pre-ordered..anyways jie i'll miss u like hell when i go to korea de, and for kok wei thx for helping me take down the notes when i'm away..i'll need to consult u when i'm back frm korea, if nt i can also consult boss or bosstress...muahahaha...and for ms lee..eh r u hinting me to buy korea ginseng mask..i tink ur facial condition already quite gd le..no need any ginseng..maybe ginseng hair removal..woah..eh just jokin lar..ms lee is a very nice CT honestly..lets hope she wun get to see this. oh yah..recently i guess our class habinng a war..nt the whole class but i guess it involves the gals and liling..ALC..tsk tsk. i gt no comments actually just that i understand she's kinda irritating..tt's wat i heard frm 0804 gals too..but when sumone of the same sex does not wanna tok to her or does not really befriend her..den her life would be miserable.
