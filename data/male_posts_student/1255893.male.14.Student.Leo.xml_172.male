We were dismissed @ about 12:20, so it shouldve been about 1 when I got home. The thing is, I also forgot that the house was gonna be fumigated. On the little notice paper they left, it said we could re-enter the house @ 4:10. I had nothing to do for 3 hours so I headed off to sutter to visit people. When I got there I  sat in Ms. Walsh's class for a while. then I chilled w/ Mr. Coombe, and off to Mr. Hanley... well I got bored so I went back to Ms. Walsh's class and graded papers :-p. I stayed for like half an hour after school. By the time I left it was 3:30, so i had 40 minutes to whore around the valley. I decided to head over to Roy's place. We played Vice City till he headed off somewhere w/ his dad. From there I went to Jose's house, went online for a few minutes, then called daddy to pick me up. all in all, a good day :).   Today was  pretty sexy too. Woke up @ 8 as we preped to pick up my slut. It was about 11 when we left. I gots to say, that car ride was fun. I was listening to some Hoobastank stuff on the way as the wind whipped my hair around wildly. We got to UCerr at abut 1 or so. Ate some Jack In The Box along the way. Tons of fun :).   Got my hair cut a few hours ago. Now I'm eatin some cups 'o noodles and watchin tv. Besides the homework this weekend's gonna be amazing overall. Im out. L8err.
