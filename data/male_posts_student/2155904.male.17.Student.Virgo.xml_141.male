His dad is going back to work so Tyke is forced to go back to the Volvo.  It will be a sentimental return but hopefully some good times will come back.  It is easy to drive that car at least.  Just not good speakers or speed.  Or smooth.  Or pretty.  Or warm.  Or...you get the picture.  But tomorrow is the last day of the school week which means that at night Tyke can do stuff.  That is going to be fun, if he does something fun.  But he has now joined Dr. Phil in having two groups of friends in a way.  For Doc P it is whites and asians and for Tyke it is IHS and SHS.  Even though the SHS aren't as exclusive as the asians are, it is pretty similar.  Well today was pretty easy.  Tyke got to play basketball second period.  He even played bump for the first time in years.  That was quite fun actually.  But 3rd period was just a chatting period.  4th was short.  Lunch was fine.  5th involved working in that class!!!!.  Amazing really.  He didn't even have to but he still did.  And he did shoddy work as usual so that's no surprise.  6th period was fun.  Those demonstrations are just really cool.  The optics and all of these things are really interesting.  Eye-catching indeed.  After school Tyke got gas for the Avalon, returned a movie, and got a few groceries.  The last time he gets to drive the Lon for a while.  Afterwards Tyke came home, ate, watched Full House, and played ESPN.  At dinner his family had a talk about the physics of baseball which was very intellectual.  Then Tyke did nothing for the rest of the night.  But his computer is still very messed up.  He did get to talk to Haras online and she loved his new buddy icon.  Tyke has been waiting for somebody to mention the icon.  Kinker has and now Haras too.  Tyke thinks this one really gets his personality well.  Hopefully tomorrow night will be fun.  Who knows, something cool could happen.  ;).
