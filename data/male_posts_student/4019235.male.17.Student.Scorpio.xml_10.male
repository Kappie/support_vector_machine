No matter the briskness of the weather, I never fail to turn up the air conditioning to “High cold”. Don’t ask me why, it has been a tradition. I just gave Jen an earful just now for, in an unprecedented attempt, snapping my guitar strings yet again. Is he gonna set a world record for the most sets of strings being replaced in a week? Considering the week started like yesterday, and he got a total of 3 strings, 2 of which has to be entirely replaced. I am so pissed, I have nothing to say. And this weather has just aggravated my mood. Thankfully, the only thing that has stopped me from imploding is the sporadic comedy Friends I had just watched on TV. Unfortunately, it ended 15 minutes ago, and all the warmness is starting to really wear off. So much for thermal equilibrium.                   Happy tomorrow’s-the maths-test-and-I-havent-fucking-studied day to all in my class. I cant wait so see how bad I can possibly get. I’m literally jumping for joy. Btw, how the hell do I do poisson and binomials, and what’s the shit about np     HEAR ME! BE YE GODS OR DEVILS, I AM A WANDERER WITHOUT GUIDANCE, A MATHLESS SOUL NEEDING RESTITUTION. HARK THY CALL!                   Whatever.                   Until now, I’m still freaking mad about what Jen did to my guitar. Man, is he gonna get it. But he got it today, a stab in his abs. Just he not cross my path the next time…..luckily for him he knows he’s in trouble, he didn’t return a jab nor retaliate in any form. Sigh, maybe I should issue an apology, but shit, u can break my guitar strings once, maybe get away with negligence twice, but FUCK, NOBODY GETS HER PUSSY WAY WITH 3 STRINGS IN LESS THAN A WEEK! IF YOU ARE READING WHIS JEN, U HAD BETTER NOT TOUCH MY GUITAR AGAIN, ASSHOLE.                   What a enticing way to end a day, with a fuckknuckle dickwad. Anyway, I think I might be inclined to delete this posting in the future due to the highly unsettling emotions within it. now, I am not gonna sit here and let more negativity be generated. I’m going to sleep.
