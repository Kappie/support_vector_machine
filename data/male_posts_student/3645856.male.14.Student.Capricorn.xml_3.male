I stayed up for 37 hours.... shelly was on AIM until 6 am the day before yesterday and I wrote a song and she said she was going to bed so I said I was staying on to write a song so... I thought "15 more minutes, George" and I ended up finishing the song and going for a bike ride around 7. I was supposed to go to ride the trails down at the Beaverdam Resevoir/Lake, I was too tired (still am :P). My mom and I took my grandmother to the doctor to get her back checked out. Borrrrrrring... had to watch Dr.Phil. I don't care for that trashy stuff.... well, it's good for a laugh sometimes, but come on, I don't even think the dude even has a real doctorates... and Oprah was the one who got him a show.      I went to the guitar shop, played a few new guitars that came in and there was a guy who was playing loud and I couldn't play because it would get all jumbled up since I couldn't tell who was playing what sometimes. lmao. I fell asleep (finally) last night... and it had to be while talking to Shelly. (:P I laid on my bed to read a guitar magazine that I got and I fell asleep...)... I hate when that happens. Anywho, I don't have anything too interesting to post. Just letting you know i'm still alive.  ~ George Mood: Tired and Aching from being sleep deprived... Basically, I feel fine except for that. :P  Music: I think I listened to Moby on my bathroom stereo while in the shower yesterday, other than that, i'm listening to Jimmy Buffett right now.  TV: I'm watching The Today Show on NBC... Jimmy Buffett is performing on the today show at the moment. I went to a Jimmy Buffett concert by myself. To tell you the truth, it was pretty strange. These people next to me were friendly before the concert then they started taking ecstasy and they started freaking out and left during the intermission... I had a really good seat and were on the middle level in the front row and there was this girl who was maybe around 16 and it was funny because she took her shirt off and asked if she could have my seats because she thought someone else was with me... Funny how they say "sex sells"... she didn't have to do that. lmao.
