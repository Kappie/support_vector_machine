I thought it was pretty funny, but not really wanting to show off I kept my mouth shut until Gaines got really pissed and I had to speak up.   I did the same thing for Kush/Nubia when he was talking about it, maybe I have a better grasp on African (aka Afrikan) history then I thought, or else, like Algebra last year, no one else knows shit so I appear to know a lot by comparisson.    I get more and more bothered with who I waste high school with.  I realize it's slightly late in my high school career to make new friends, but each year I usually get stuck around a crowd of people I don't like.  This really does apply to Michael, Idris and Thomas, who I've been friends with before high school, nor the numerous girls I've been friends with before high school.  But this new damn crowd of people I'm wasting my time with just isn't working, I mean, nothing is wrong with them completely, I guess they are all good people in their own right, I just don't fit in with anyone I hang out with and the gap seems to grow day by day.  I mean there is nothing wrong with hanging around a huge amount of white kids (and like five other black guys) but our interest are totally different that's the thing.   Very few of my friends listen to Rap, much less underground/ultra-left wing Rap.  Then add to that the fact I think in an overly philosophical manner I really feel out of touch.  Granted, I'm planning on going to a punk concert Friday, but is my heart really in it?  No, I just want to see a camp friend, that's about it.  I guess this is one of the reason I've been hesistant to go out of the house with anyone, I just feel my interest have moved to far away from everyone elses.    Does anyone else know what I'm trying to communicate?  It just feels like Sophmore year saw me making this huge rift, and it's grown to the point where I can't ignore the rift any longer.  Maybe it's just arrogance, but I really try not to think of myself as being better then anyone, because everyone has a purpose.  So could it just be I'm stressing to much? Could this be the real source of my stress? I assume that only I can truly discover that, but I hate it at the same time.  I can't create a clear path for myself anymore, it's not good enough to just be happy without a reason.  It's not good enough to just be happy being complacent.  Throughout this entire summer, I felt this year would bear "first fruits" (to anyone who understands Kwanzaa) but so far all I am is impatient for that, and it's burning me up.    I don't mean to carry on day-after-day, but I figure I've always been to closed mouth about myself, and I've known it for months.  In the past, I'd rarely have hada  venue to talk, and even if I did, ideas made me happy.  They were important enough to share, then I was joking that was good enough.  But I guess joking is a way of hiding, I love seeing people laugh, and I guess that's the best emotion I can ever think of.  I mean, do you ever get your heart broken laughing?  Has anyone ever commited a horrible crime because they thought someone was funny? I really doubt it.  I'm still ramballing though, and I think I could be getting Carpel-Tunnel in my left wrist, so I better slow it down for now.
