So I decided to submit my paper from 192w last year to the ALBA essay contest. With a $500 booty, I will more than recoup my costs from doing all the research. I talked to Nick about ideas that I might implement into the paper.. he also suggested that if I've put so much effort into it, and I'm going to put more into it... that I should polish it up to a point where I might want to try to get it published. We'll see... I have a month and a half to work on revisions.  I got  Donnie Darko  from NetFlix today... I wonder if I should watch it tonight?  Tomorrow... I need to pay the bank a visit, go grocery shopping, do some reading, and buy Interpol tickets. I should also get to work on a paper for 602 and start thinking about what I wanna do for my 690 research project.  **
