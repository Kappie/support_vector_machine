(yes the tv show and my actual friends) gas prices going down the drive in movies the girl of my dreams driving around for long periods of time doing absolutely nothing and yet having the time of my life boating with kaitlyn moore remembering kara and andrea come home on MONDAY!! berries from the farmer's market farmer's market in general making new friends being weird and crazy, but learning to love it all the same. finding out who you are being happy in the midst of the downs of life being totally confused with where life is taking you..and why life sucks so much..but deciding to take that on with a smile instead of anger my job and my co-workers brushing my teeth laughing smiling thinking about colleges and what the future has to offer knowing that, people who suck i can either a)avoid, or b) they'll be leaving soon enough (only a year left to deal with some of em'!) realizing that even if people "suck" they still have so much importance in my life..and teach me so much about myself and how the world works. stars sunsets sammy my dog and sammy kara's dog MUSIC summer   hmm. good stuff. i think that even though it's hard, when you have a really tough time in life..no matter what i think the good stuff in life always will outweigh the bad. keep your chin up kid. you can get through this dawg.   g'night.
