Incorporating scientific advice into policymaking involves an implied contract of trust between government officials and scientists. Scientists trust that their advice will be weighed honestly, without attempts to distort, deny or refute it. Government officials trust that scientists will not inject personal opinions or a political agenda into their advice. I'm not sure where this "implied contract" comes from. One would certainly hope that any administration would be open to any and all points of view -- something that I think our current administration cannot seem to get right -- but the notion that government-funded science itself isn't or shouldn't be political is ridiculous. Scientific research is expensive; it requires money. The sources of funding will almost always have one political or philosophical bent of one kind or another and so, to one degree or another, scientific research will necessarily bend to the will of the funding bodies. All the more reason to leave government out of such endeavors. ...but that's just me. Want another example? How about government funding for the arts? Now  there's  a topic on which we can all agree.  Not.
