Actually I think it was Kevin's relative Josh who had one first, then Kevin copied him and Erica copied Kevin and I'm doing one because Erica suggested that I do so. I'll probably steal a digital camera (probably Gannon's) and get some crazy pictures up and maybe I'll post some creative literature that I make or something.      Kevin went to Kansas this morning and I'm not entirely sure when he comesback but I need to go terrorize his mom, cat and house whilst he's not present. I (like the procrastinatorI've proven to be) haven't started summer reading yet and I have two books to read.I was supposed to go byKevin's and get "To Sir With Love" today and of course forgot to.      Anyway...I don't really have anything to post of today so...commenton thisholy creation of bloggism andgo stomp on your neighbor's roof!
