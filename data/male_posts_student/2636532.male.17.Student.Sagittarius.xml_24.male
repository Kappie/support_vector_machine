Yes i know most of you absolutly love halloween, if you're younger you get to go trick or treating and if you're older you love seeing all those little kids dressed up.  Me, it's a different story all together, i hate halloween.  I hate every part of it, i hate handing out candy to all those greedy little kids that think i'm stuid enough to be fooled by their "brilliant" plan to get more candy by putting on a different mask. Especially since i know every kid in my neighbourhood.  I also hate going trick or treating just to freeze my ass of for a few candies.  And most of all, i hate the kids that are bored of the treat part of halloween and go for tricks.  The stupid little kids come by every year with their arsenal of eggs, toilet paper, flaming dog crap, and various rotten vegetables.  Every year they  and every year i chase them off. Usually i'll have a water gun o balloons, i know you're thinkng "whoop-dee-doo water never hurt anyone" but when it's cold out and you're a long way from home the last thing you want is to get wet. I tell you though, next year i'll be ready for those little bastards, i'll be in the bush with a paint ball gun. -Matt
