WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!?!?!?!?!  music of the moment: shorts are for warm (full album) - polar bears  so a friend of mine and i were chillin climbing trees and laying in the brnaches when we got the urge to climb something else. we got on the roof of this elementary school and apparently someone called the cops on us. they showed up, we ran, "youre gonna get arrested if you keep running," we stopped running, and got a good talkin to from the cop. he said "i was just gonna tell you to not go on the roof again and to not come back, but you ran and thats illegal. if i were a huskier cop id have arrested you, but youre lucky i dont mind running." im glad i stopped running. he got our information and we left. now im in the cops database 6 times over. good times.
