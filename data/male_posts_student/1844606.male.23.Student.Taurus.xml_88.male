First, the Cubs lost, sending the series back to Atlanta with K-Wood going tomorrow.  Here's hoping that the Cubs can squeeze out one more game and live to fight another day, against the fightin' fish.  How sad is it that the Marlins knocked off the Giants?    Fortunately, the Red Sox won, saving them from elimination, at least for another day.  I watched Trot Nixon's home run and screamed aloud.  No one took notice, until I wrote of it here.    Most promising thing.  I went out tonight with a group that I didn't know, and I think most every one enjoyed me.  Especially the girl that invited me.  Turns out I was working under false pretenses and she is no longer with her boyfriend of 6 odd years.  If she has someone else, I can't say, probably does.  But for a brief few moments I felt alive.  There's something about making a girl laugh when you're just being yourself that can't be matched.   I didn't drink out at the bar for fear of stomach issues/ the ride back home, but I did when I got back to her apartment, and that my friends is what accounts for the current inebriation (and my inabiltity to spell/care about the fact I can't spell inebriation).  While some might construe this rambling attempt to reconstruct the night's events as silly and drunken stupidity towards the said/afformentioned(yet not named girl), let the record state I thought she was gorgious back when I met her Sophmore year and furthermore, she's got a great smile and a drive to get everyone involved with events and making sure is all right.  Dig it baby, she's good, yet probably unabtainable.  But she did say (whether drunk or not) that I'm rather funny.  We shall see.  God, loneliness is rediculous and I shall now crawl into my bed (which I spent over approx. 10 hours of the past 24, currled up with a blanket and a pillow, for a sense of security and proximity I haven't known in over a full 2 years).  To say my love life is on the decline is a great exaggeration.  And I shall end my rant like this:  The birthday girl got a sex toy for her birthday and her roommate threw it at me in order to make me feel "involved" with the party. Such is college life.  I consummed three or four beers under the span of an hour, ate pizza, and then had two doughnuts when I came home.  Guess tomorrow will be a test of my systems ability to handle gluten/ see how much the treatment works.  G'night and here's to fond dreams of a beautiful girl in a white shirt, and grey sweats.
