"this may never start. we could fall apart. and i'd be your memory. lost your sense of fear.  feelings insincere. can i be your memory?  so get back, back, back to where we lasted. just like i imagine. i could never feel this way. so get back, back, back to the disaster. my heart's beating faster. holding on to feel the same.  this may never start. i'll tear us apart. cannot be your enemy. losing half a year. waiting for you here i'd be your anything."  --- urlLink sugarcult ,  memory
