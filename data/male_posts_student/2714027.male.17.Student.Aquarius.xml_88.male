We were meant to be looking at urban regeneration, which we did, but we ate more ice creams than write notes.    We got the train up to London Bridge, then visited the riverside areas, Docklands, Canada Square (Canary Wharf), Greenwich and various other places that I can't remember the names of. Basically, we went round a lot of the really cool, refurbished areas which have been invested in and now look pretty damn good. There were loads of Starbucks and all those sort of fancy coffee shops dotted around, along with marinas, art galleries, expensive apartements and so on.    I took my camera with me and I had a real field day there, snapping all the cool architecture around, especially the mighty Canada Square. You can see the best of my pictures at  urlLink my Deviant Art homepage  in the gallery there. One final note; the weather didn't let us down at all and it was sunny and warm throughout the day, providing excellent shooting conditions. For once, the British weather did me proud.
