Maybe it's just not isolated to this city, but I've been noticing a lot of people who act more hip than thou, grown up rich-kid snobs, cultural chameleons and those who consume pop culture like it was gospel. I wish I had some kind of artistic ability to vent this frustration, so anyone with said abilities is reading this, I'm jealous of you.
