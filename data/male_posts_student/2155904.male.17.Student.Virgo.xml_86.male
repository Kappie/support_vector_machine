Tyke made it fun at least.  Then he walked with Tina and chatted to Amyazing for about a second before heading off to weight training.  That class was boring as hell.  It was lock day.  So Tyke got his lock and then sat on the bench in there for about 35 minutes.  Maybe more.  It was hell.  Better than dying though.  Tyke really had a pretty boring 3rd period.  4th period wasn't too bad.  Then came lunch.  Yep, lunch in the van.  That was sick.  They went out to Subway.  A full van.  Dr Phil riding shotty, Amed and Kinker in the mid, and Macaroon, etc in the back.  A full van indeed.  But it was fun.  The only problem with the van is the cd player but Tyke has actually found out how to make it work.  So that is good for future reference.  The rest of the day kinda wound down and dissipated out.  Well, not so much physics where they had some very interesting conversations.  In english Purdy wrote a very dirty haiku (dirtier than Tyke's even) and that pretty much summed up what was talked about in physics.  Not the haiku but that topic.  But really, what's more fun to talk about than sex?  Nothing.  Plain and simple.  Nobody can truthfully say otherwise (probably a pretty big lie but still Tyke can say it cuz he is the author).  So anyway after school Tyke and Purdy talked some more about the always-pertinent topic of standing with your significant other when they put their arm around you but not over your shoulder, rather on your hip.  Purdy thinks it is weird to have that happen.  More of just, what is she supposed to do?  Tyke's first suggestion was to just roll it into a hug.  Not a bad idea at first he thought but now it is less of a plausible idea.  But after school Tyke, Purdy, Tina, and Tig'Ol all tried some new ways to handle the situation.  And also the hand on the far hip while walking situation.  Where the girl doesn't know what to do with her hand.  Well, as Tyke has learned from watching Newlyweds, Jessica Simpson just puts her hand on Nick like he does to her.  So that seems to work well.  Maybe that too is implausible but there has to be an answer to that problem.  Someday it will be discovered.  And when it is Tyke will be happy.  Until then he will be wondering.  Not really though cuz he will be wondering more about another subject.  His next subject of discussion in fact.  And that would be relationships.  A highly discussed topic but always relevant in this day and age.  Well, here is what Tyke is going to talk about.  Actually, he is just going to ramble.  Tyke doesn't get why relationships have to be so hard.  Sure, nobody really understands that but Tyke really questions it.  Like why do people have to be so stupid about things.  If the majority of this world would just think before acting and not say one thing and do another then there would be far fewer problems.  And lying doesn't protect feelings.  Lying is found out easily and then it creates just a magnitude of problems.  Rather than lie about something just come out and if it is something that could potentially cause strife in the relationship then discuss it with your partner.  That takes more guts anyway.  And it should, at least if your partner is not a prick, show that you care about them and are looking to keep things steady and happy.  Mainly, be cognizent of your partner's feelings because if you aren't then there are just too many opportunities for difficulties down the road.  And also, Tyke thinks that being forward is also important (at least to him, a lot of people might not agree).  Keep things up front and then it won't seem like you are hiding anything.  But really, if you just don't let stupid, passing feelings get in the way of what you feel for your partner then you will be fine.  It helps to know what your partner (Tyke doesn't like using partner but he knows no other word he wants to use) thinks and feels as well.  Such as if they are a person that can be somewhat prone to getting kind of jealous then know that and make sure that you don't do anything that is too flirty.  Now if the person is getting jealous over nothing, then that is a different story and then the problem falls upon him/her.  Don't get jealous yourself.  Tyke has used a lot of "don't"s so here is a do.  Do be loving and cherish the moments you have.  Cuz they will be fleeting moments in not too long.  For most, you will not be with your other for much longer so these are the times that you should be holding onto.  Don't let chances pass you by.  Take what you can get.  Believe Tyke, you will be kicking yourself if you miss opportunities.  And that is one of the worst feelings in the world, you know what the worst is...haha.  To quote a great poem, don't let opportunities pass you by for you may "catch yourself yawning" should you do so.  All this advice is really pretty straightforward and Tyke really didn't need to say any of it because it should be common knowledge but it isn't to a lot of people.  And if you are taking advice you must be messed up.  Cuz look at how well his advice has helped him out!  Haha, just kidding cuz any advice is good advice as long as it is heeded with a clear mind.  No matter the donater of advice.  Oh, and by the way Tyke IS single.  Just so you know...
