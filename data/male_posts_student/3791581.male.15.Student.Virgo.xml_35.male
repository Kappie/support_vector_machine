Our Summer so far has consisted of Spring like temperatures with a touch of May showers. At the start of this work week, the weather was forecasted as rain, rain, some sunshine and more rain. The day it was supposed to be nice and sunny, turned out to be dark and rainy. And to top it all off that was the day I decided I didn't need an umbrella....grrr...How is a girl to pick out the perfect outfit each day? HA! I am not one for baking in the hot sun nor feeling sweat and perspiration against my skin . However, I would feel some sort of comfort knowing I experienced a Summer which normally includes a weather forecast with days upon days of sun! Ahh...who am I kidding!
