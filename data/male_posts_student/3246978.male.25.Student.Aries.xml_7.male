Those with whom Dhirubhai Ambani had been sharing prosperity for 25 years and those who trust him like God.   If you are a loyal shareholder of Reliance and a fan of Dhirubhai Ambani (which most shareholders are) we advise you to take all medical precautions before reading this article. As all your loyalty and trust may be challenged. You may feel cheated. All the while you thought Reliance cheats only with the government, competitors etc but never with its own shareholders - it’s true no more. Till early nineties they needed you because they regularly needed funds for their new projects. Not any more. Now Reliance internal cash generation is enough for investing in its new projects and now they don’t want to share the profits with you. They want to corner all the profits themselves leaving you with leftovers. Don’t believe me? Just read on.   If you are a shareholder of Reliance you must have received Reliance Petroleum Limited annual report for the year 2000 - 2001. Did you ever spared some time to go through it or you trust them blindly? Open page no. 38. At the top you find SCHEDULE 'O' (cont.). Item 22. Contingent liabilities - part d) - SALES TAX DEFERRAL LIABILITY ASIGNED.For 2000 - 2001 it’s Rs. 1370.46 crores. Ever cared to find out what it is? 1370 crores is not a small amount to ignore isn’t it?   Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) defines Contingent Liability as liability that does not exist at present but depends on future happening. In plain words this is not a liability but in future if something bad happens (which normally is not expected), this may become a liability. Now lets go into its background. Gujrat government as an incentive to invest in the state had given Reliance group facility to pay all sales tax liability for the first 14 years of operation at the end of 14 years (. i.e. deferred payment). In the meanwhile each year liability is treated as interest free loan from the government to the company.   In other words, it is a liability that is not dependent on any future occurrence. Now the question arises then why it is mentioned as contingent liability. I asked the same question to secretive Reliance group and to my surprise they replied (copy of the reply attached). As per the reply   "... The sales tax liability has since been discharged by Reliance Petroleum Limited by assigning the same in favour of a third party after making the payment of due consideration calculated based on the net present value of the future liability. The said liability is required to be discharged by the assignee on the due dates of the payment of deferred sales tax amount.  As clarified above, since Reliance Petroleum Limited has already discharged its liability, it is no more a liability of the company; however, it is contingently liable and therefore we have included the same as part of contingent liabilities in the notes of accounts..."    In the right of shareholder of the company I had been requesting the group to disclose the identity of the third party and the present value factor for almost two years now, without any success. The only reply I got is "its a company internal matter" and that also not in writing.   What I apprehend is - Reliance group had assigned this amount to one of its group companies (my guess is RCL - Reliance Capital Limited) in which the Ambanies hold almost 100% share at very low net present value factor. Now you would like to know how does it affect you?    Reliance Ltd.’s internal rate of return is approximately 22%. Now as people other than Ambanies hold almost 45% of the shares, the Ambanies have to share it with them. Now if they instead of investing this thousand of crores lying with RIL directly in project like Infocomm, transfer this sum at lower rate say 10% to a wholly owned company and then invest it, they can rob the shareholders of 12% return annually (22% - 10%) and put it in their personal pockets. It means you are getting less than 50% of what you really deserve.   And if you think that you are better off taking safe return of 10% rather than risking your money to project like INFOCOMM do not be fooled (this is where contingent liability comes in). Because in case the Infocomm project fails the privately held company of Ambanies will default in paying Gujrat govt. 14 years hence. And as the primary liability is on RIL they will have to pay it. It’s like taking the risk of an equity shareholder and getting return of a debenture holder.   Ever wondered why Reliance industries Ltd. is investing only 45% in Reliance infocomm. They state that another 45% is being invested by Ambanies from their personal account and through privately held companies. Infocomm project is said to cost Rs. 25000 crores. 45% of which comes out to be 11,250 crores. Okay we admit that Ambanies are one of the richest but that is because they own RIL. Do you expect Rs.11, 250 crores of hard cash is lying in Ambanies personal accounts?   Now you must be thinking exact sum by which you have been cheated. Well as we don’t have the exact detail of the present value factor, sales tax liability for the next 14 years and the company to which it has been assigned we can’t give you an exact amount. But I will try to make a conservative estimate based on the above figures.   In 2001-2002 the sales tax liability assigned had been 1370 crores. As it was only the first year of operation after which oil prices have raised and Reliance is contemplating an output hike we can realistically estimate this sum to go up to Rs. 2000. Crores, but for conservative sake I stick to 1370 crores.   Now internal rate of return of Reliance group had been estimated by Business Today magazine as 22% I will stick to it. And in absence of information about net present value rate at which it had been assigned we take it as 10% (don’t be surprised if in reality its not even 8%).   Calculating it for 14 years (n)    1370 [n(n+1) / 2 ] x 12% = Rs.17262 crores.    It means you have been robbed of Rs. 17,262 crores over a period of 14 years on a conservative basis. On real basis I assure you it would be much more than the total cost of Infocomm project. i.e. Rs 25000.   Now lets check out with the Auditor Mr. D. Chaturvedi partner of CHATURVEDI  SHAH. His report says (point 8 page 23) “ The company has granted secured loans to companies, firms or other parties listed in the register maintained under Section 301 of the companies Act, 1956 or to the companies under the same management within he meaning of sub-section (IB) of Section 370 of the companies Act, 1956. In our opinion the rate of interest and other terms and conditions of such loan are not prima facie prejudicial to the intrest of the company.”   The above is the only part that may be relevant, here also they have not mentioned the rate. The report is the usual auditors report with no reference to the above matter. I wrote to them also for information about present value rate and third party without success.   So what do we do now? Reliance group will not disclose anything until unless they are forced to. (When they don’t even care to inform their Reliance India Mobile subscribers at what rate they are exactly charging, what do you expect). And it’s very difficult to force something out of this group. I am sure they will pull strings somewhere and this story will never see daylight. Solution?? Its for you to decide, anyway its your money.   Disclaimer: All the above calculations and apprehensions are based on the limited information available with us. Facts and refusal of Reliance group to part with information about third party identity and present value rate forced us to reach at this conclusion. If Reliance group has a better explanation to it nobody will be more happier then we the loyal shareholders of the company and die-hard fan of Dhirubhai Ambani.
