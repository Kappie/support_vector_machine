The more I focus on a problem, the bigger it seems to get, and, just recently, I have been reminded of what it feels like to reach saturation point. The truth is that the problem is only as real as I make it, so the trick is to cut the cord connecting ego to issue and just  let it go!   So, I thought I'd post this, as I normally make the decision that 'tomorrow, I will set things right' (ironically, this is what I decided yesterday, so make of that what you will!). This is a declaration of will!  I have one 5000 word paper and one 10 000 word paper left, and then that's my Masters complete. Come October, it's the end of the sabbatical, the end of the Masters, the end of this strange bubble.  Inevitably, the start of a new bubble.  But the groundwork for change must be laid down now.
