Scholars hear, but do not learn.   I gave it up, but now am a part..   now am apart...    A part of the way.   following you, standing close,   hand in hand, locked in love,   stareing deeply in your eyes,   feeling your touch, the touch of your lips,   that's the way of the goldfish.    Hear me out, listen now   I've found the way   the way of life,   the way of hope,   the way of peace,   the way of love,   the way of the goldfish.    following you, standing close,   hand in hand, locked in love,   stareing deeply in your eyes,   feeling your touch, the touch of your lips,   that's the way of the goldfish.    I ask you now, with humble heart,   Forget your cares, and worry no more.   join the quest, and find the way   the way, the way, the way, the way!!!    The way of the goldfish...
