It's a funny thing to see all these tourist types wandering round Edinburgh in their T shirts and shorts in the pouring rain. How little they knew about the weather here before they came.  Sunday saw me goping to see the new Trot film. You know, for something that has been plugged as much as it has and with all those famous people in it it hasn't half got a load of boring drivel in it that makes it form a good film into one which suddenly stops in the middle fo the action to go on about something I don't really want to know about still. It's good to see they didn't just arbitrarily make things up like they tend to do in modern films and stuck to the original stroy (yeah right)  I also managed to see about 10 seconds of the  urlLink formula 1  on Sunday. In fact all I saw was Schumacher getting out of his car having won and hugging his team- mate. Then I turned it off. It's a bit much when you can correctly predicat that the Ferraris will come first and second then Jensen Button with both McLarens engines' blowing up. I mean it won't do that much for the popularity of an already dying sport. In fact I won;t hold my breath for the next round or even get out of bed for it.  It would be nice to be surprised more often  Jack
