Site visits are fairly ok but people dont stay or join the forum, the google ads have made me almost Â£5 so far which is good.  Basically could you please gimme some ideas of what to do with it?  This week should be pretty good, the roof problem is now fixed (official now as of this morning) a hell of alot of people are returning from holidays and they is now exactly a week before my mother and bro jet off on their holidays, leaving me alone :D  I will be dragging people and their stuff around the house of Atrocity and hopefully do something of some interest. Next saturday i'm probably seeing Jonny (back of holiday) along with hopefully Vix and Sarah, i'm not sure what we are up to.  I'm quite happy now, my desire for love goes on but its well under control and besides alot of people need me at this time which is cool but also important as i do love them alot ;-) . Responsibility is something i'm afraid of put i reckon its gonna slap me in the face and i'm gonna have to face it and take it on, who knows i could be a manager or leader in years time :S
