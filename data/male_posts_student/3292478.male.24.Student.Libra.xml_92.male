( G et  R id  O f  S limy Girl S ) even bears a resemblance to Tyler Duerden's underground fighting society!  The similarities are, to be honest, rather far-fetched and most of the comparative elements are clearly just likely coincidences. And as with most story-telling devices those elements are not exactly unique to either  Calvin  Hobbes  or  Fight Club .  Very amusing nevertheless!!!
