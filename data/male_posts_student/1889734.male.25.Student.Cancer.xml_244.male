Sadly, we played improperly when I was the British, resulting in the total defeat of the British forces under my command, and giving us another twenty years of Nazi rule in Europe.  After switching sides and learning of our improper play, the pathetic German defenders under my command staged an accurate reproduction of the events of June 6, 1944.  Unfortunately, right about the time the Germans would receive significant reinforcements in the morning of June 7th, our time expired, leaving us with questions of 'what if'.  Quite unsatisfying to tell the truth.  http://www.multimanpublishing.com/ASL/prodpb.php  In case you were wondering what I'm talking about, see link above.  As for the Blog, I'm catching up on about 100 real email messages and filtering our more junk.  I work today and tomorrow before the holiday break, so I probably won't be updating too many things here.  If you are so inclined, check back from time to time.  Otherwise, I'll see you all in the new year, and I hope you all have a great Christmas (no Happy Holidays crap here).
