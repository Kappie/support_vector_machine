I really am getting sick of GameFAQs "Best. Game. Ever." contest. Basically if a game is going up against a Final Fantasy game, you know the other game is going to lose. I really hope GameFAQs makes another contest excluding all of the games that the SquareSoft (or SquareEnix if you give a shit) fanboys would usually vote for. What I really hated was that Doom (One of my all-time favorite games) actually won once, then went against Final Fantasy III, and lost. You damn well know that if the Final Fantasy was'nt in there, Doom would have been in the finals. Ah well, I can dream, can't I?
