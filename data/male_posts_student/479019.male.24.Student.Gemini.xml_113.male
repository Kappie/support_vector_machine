Afterwork I got some Fuddruckers with George and then talked to Jenny on the way home. I then did my note card for my midterm in the morning. I'm feeling kind of tired. A lot of stuff went on today.  On my list of things to do tomorrow are:     Check to see if CSUF got my transcripts.     Call the Herrick Library to see if they have the  Motion Picture Hearld .     Write up my 1 page progress report on my research.     Be in Janet's friend's video.   The song of the moment before I go to bed is "Island in the Sun" by  Weezer  from their  Green  album (2001).  ***
