But finally we have time to sit and talk about things...alot has happened since we had our last real conversation on the third of march. You've heard me time and time again talk about how  it only takes one second..one little thing to change your entire life..and how many many little things have to happen at that exact second as well...weird how life is.  Can you relate, Journal? I mean..You wouldn't even be "alive" right now had had a collaboration of many thoughts all at once...the need to express myself..the pleasure i get from someone enjoying my writings...the flashbacks to the old "Straight Up" and "Feel the experience" journals of sorts from the old JS michaels web page, my personal appeal to seeing into peoples lives(ie reality tv, matt youngs blog), some sort of odd motivation AND whatever else was going through my mind at the moment...at some point, Journal, All of thoughts sent me to blogspot.com and a few hours later..you were taking your first steps...you were alive..there I was expressing myself away..typing into this edit box what was flowing through my mind..i poured out my soul. Ever since then, when I needed you to listen, you have.  At times i've said some things here that maybe i shouldnt have exposed to the public, but still Journal, I dont see you as a mistake just because of any strife that may have come as a result of  your "birth".  "There is no such thing as a mistake...there is only what you do and what you don't do"  Write that one down..its from the movie Unfaithful.  Allright...well i'm sure some of you were amused..and most of you were frightened by me "talking" to my journal..but hell, how boring would it be if I did the conventional "haven't written in awhile" opening..that goes something like..bla bla busy..bla bla computer something...bla bla ok heres whats going on in my life...bye..  I've been looking through my link tracker and noticed a good deal of people i dont even know are reading this, and thats good..very good..for those of you new to my world..go back and read some of the older entries....half of the stuff here may mean nothing to you otherwise.  If youre not new to this journal...then keep reading....I know you've come back multiple times waiting for an update..and  I'm delivering now...Unlike the pull out method of birth control..i'm extremely dependable when i have to cater to my Audience.  Throughout this entry i'm going to write in some song lyrics from songs that are currently playing..I have my winamp on random usually when i write and there are about 2500 songs in the rotation...these lyrics may or may not have any relation to what i'm writing..Don't read into ANY of them. They are random.  I just wanted to do something different and unconventional..and I wanted to do something that pretty much made no sense otherwise..ehh..this is what i decided to do...the song lyrics will be displayed within 2 double asterisks...ya know..those star looking things... For example, lyrics may look something like this...lets pretend a vanillla ice song is on my winamp and i decide to write lyrics say NOW **Allright stop,collaborate and listen, ice is back with a  brand new invention** THATS what it would look like...and now that preschool is over, its time to dive in to my life..or something like it..  When last you really had a window into my life...the march  3rd edtion..You read about ZBT losing our house,a few crazy parties, Me and markle beating smiley in beer pong, and some philosophical thoughts about life. Just some quick updates on all of those subjects before moving on to now. The "house guys" got another house...pretty far from campus..its good for them because they have some place to live but bad for us that like to party...We did however a  few going away sorta parties and a tap with Lambda Iota **You kicked my foot under the table, i kicked you back, I cant Say i'm able** which surprisingly DIDNT suck..the first non sucky tap i've been to actually.  Smiley turned 21 at a good time because his beer pong career has been sidelined by the lack of a place for him to persue his dream...Ever since the defeat..smiley just hasnt been the same..some say he lost his smile...should we then start calling him 'y'..as in WHY did i lose to markle and sopp? hehe As far as the philosophical thoughts at the bottom of that entry..i havent yet found anyhing to make me want to modify them in any way..they seem to be holding true.  Now here's the part in my writings where I use an event to the past in order to transition into the present. In the last entry there was a mention of a trip to Banana Joe's that occurred the night before the infamous "Don's Party"...and that night that one second happened that would turn my life as i knew it upside down in a way.. I failed to detail that night but in  nutshell, heres what went down: **i aint gonna live forever, i just want to life while i'm alive..its my life..my heart is like an open highway..like frankie said "i did it my way" i just want to live while i'm alive**    **and a time to every purpose under heaven**   Ahh yes...Fraternity issues...last friday was a ritual of ours which i'm glad I attended...as you may or may not know, i have trust issues with people in general...and I think guys more that women, but anyway...I got a chance to really know the brothers that showed up..but even moreso..they got to really know me...By looking at me i doubt anyone can figure out who i am inside...my brothers that were there now know me..and I got a renewed sense of the meaning of brotherhood...we really got to **And i knew if i had my chance that i could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for awhile** bond..and to all those brothers who didnt show up..its your loss and i'm deeply pissed off about that... The fraternity seems to be quite weakened right now...the loyalty to the brotherhood is weak..and i've decided at some point to kick my skills for leadership and problem solving into gear and work on making ZBT solid as it once was...We really have a lot of brothers with alot of heart...they just need motivation and we'll be ontop in no time... If i had the chance i would certainly run for a position on the E board..and i'm really honestly considering it...but if run for anything and lose..i have  Ideas and i'm not keeping my mouth shut..i'm motivated, mother fuckers!! Oh yeah..by the way..i've been nominated for IFC VP...which i probably won't get..but it was nice to get nominated **and i dont want to lose your love tonight**  but i'd rather have a position in ZBT than IFC  Right now the thought train has died..john and ray are here..so i cant exactly be in deep thought..but thats my life right now... ohh and looking back on some quotes..i DID NOT force the songs to play while they were playing..and some did make sense with what was going through my mind but it was in no way premeditated... Time to not write anymore for a bit.. Bllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.. A few random thoughts -I hate my major -I'm hungry right now -wow..ray has a girlfriend -the vampire moth -matt likes old cdr's -war is reality tv -I miss you baby -he fought the birds for the candy bar -cinco de mayo -cheddar jay -the cuddler -a drive Thanks for reading...  Peace
