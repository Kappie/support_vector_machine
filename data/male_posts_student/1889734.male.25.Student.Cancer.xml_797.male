At the same time, CNN is now reporting that one of the houses destroyed was a safehouse of al-Zarqawi.  This is encouraging news.  I wonder if we got him?  That would certainly be a plus.  We'll see how the news develops.    While the enemies of the war will certainly decry any bombing of houses in the middle of the city, I think we have to keep a historical perspective of war in general.  At least we aren't looking at Dresden or Tokyo here in terms of raw carnage.  I know, little consolation to the Iraqi boy playing the street when the bombs come, but I don't see how it can be helped.  The  enemy is engaging in asymettric warfare, using the general population to cloak the guerilla forces.  The best thing the civilian population can do to help themselves is begin to stand up against those that would use them in this fashion.  Evidence suggests that many Iraqis are starting to do just that - turning in their neighbors and feeding information to the coallition.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that some Iraqis dropped the dime on these safehouses.  Civilian death is regretable, but the survivors will have a better life someday.
