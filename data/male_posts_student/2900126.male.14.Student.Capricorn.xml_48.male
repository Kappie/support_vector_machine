Kate Beckinsale, I see why Josh thinks she's hot, mainly because of the simple fact that, she is. I think that they might make an "Underworld 2", the ending made it seem as if the "adventure" wasn't over yet. But anyway my cousin's friend *LinZ you know who that is* ~_^ is supposed to be making me a "Blacked Eyed Peas" cd, I like them, as a musical group that is. But yeah I guess I'll talk to you guys/girls later. Sweet Dreams!
