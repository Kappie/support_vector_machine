Hmm... what happened? nothing much really, except that i was like... in this really moody and vulgar mood cause of my stupid back! yeah well... what happened? well... actually, my back has been injured for over a month already but than... it was getting better till i twisted it again just 3 days ago cause of soccer! ARGH! than yesterday, training wasn't say very relax lah... it was tougher than normal... so... i strained it even worse lah! crap! now i can't do basketball until my back is better! ARGH! this is so shitty! damn it! Anyway, Kelly... if you by hook or crook get this blog add... I'm sorry yeah... Really sorry...  Anyway, the back is really painful... wah lau... now right, even while sitting down and just moving a little bit all of a sudden triggers this sharp pain up my back... shit lah... i hope it doesn't affect my entire life... think that i am going to see a chinese sensei tomorrow... damn it... haiz... pray for me yeah?! haha...  hmmm... anyway, had a nice chat with Mich Wong yesterday and it made me realise how much i miss those OG days... damn it... i miss the company as a whole... especially Val and Mich Wong i guess... don't know why lah... but miss those 2 Jie Meis the most! haha... guess... cause most of my secrets now go to them... haha... anyway, admitted something to Mich Wong that everyone wouldn't know besides me and her lah... so... lalalala... heex...
