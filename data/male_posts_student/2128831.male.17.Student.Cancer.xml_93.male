Well, there is this part I didn't add yesterday about how when we're kids we want to do fun things that are bad like lighting matches.  Have you ever had a crush? And I’m not talking about a lusty, wonton yearning to devour someone in a sweaty heart pounding physical entrée.  I mean something innocent, yet MORE than that. Have you ever been drawn to someone you don’t know? You may know OF them, maybe their name, where they work, or who some of their friends are - but you don’t know them. Yet something burns inside of you, but not a fierce burn, more like a steady pull welling up inside. You know that feeling – when you’ve done something really nice and rewarding, and you take a moment, a deep breath, a long satisfied breath – exhaling, and you feel IT, this relaxing, comforting, happy energy, flowing from your centre / your heart through your entire body, all the way out to your toes and fingertips. Well, that’s the feeling that overwhelms you the moment your gaze settles upon them.  You’re entranced.  Every time you physically see them, or hear them time stops. You’re heart, captivated, neglects its duty and misses a beat.  You forget to take in breath, being mesmerized by their presence, but you don’t even notice. Have you ever had a crush?  Has your vision of this object of your desire grown in time? Have you imagined, have you dreamt of how perfect they COULD be? Have you ever contemplated what would make someone the perfect compliment to who you are? Someone who was everything you ever wished for? Have you ever let your innocent crush be corrupted by this dream of perfection? Have you ever had a chance to meet the object of your crush? If you had let your crush smolder for years  years, nearly half a decade, corrupted by your selfish dreams of perfection, would you dare meet the object of your crush? Would you believe that there could be ANY chance whatsoever that this object of your crush could live up to these considerable expectations? Would you welcome the chance to cure yourself of this simmering yearning and this growing dream of perfection incarnated, or would you fear disappointment in the discovery that the dream is nothing more than that – a dream? Would you think killing the dream is better than forever living with this unfulfilled desire? Have you ever been self-doubting? Have you ever really looked deep within yourself  accepted who you feel you are – all limitations, flaws  fears included? Have you ever looked at yourself… …and then looked at someone else, someone special, and realized that they deserve so much more than you? Have you ever thought that, even though they are perfect – they are everything you could possibly want – there is no possible way that you could be the perfect compliment to them – that you are not perfect for them?  Do you think that you are exceptional? I do. Of course, I’m an egotistical, pompous ass.  I am a yellow-orange, rectangle-shaped cheese. I am very popular. Ihave lots of zip and energy and love to jump around. I am sharp and clever, but also sometimes a little stubborn. The most widely purchased and eaten cheese in the world. Cheddar cheeses were originally made in England, however today they are manufactured in many countries all over the world. Fully cured Cheddar is a hard, natural cheese. It is shaped like a drum, 15 inches in diameter, with natural rind bound in cloth. Normally, the color of Cheddar ranges from white to pale yellow. Some Cheddars, however, have a color added, giving the cheese a yellow-orange color. Cheddar is always made from cow's milk and has a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured. If the cheese is too young, the texture is smooth. Cheddar gets a sharper taste the longer it matures. It is generally matured between 9 and 24 months. The important thing in purchasing Cheddar, is to consider the age of the cheese. Milk is heated to 86 degrees F and inoculated with a lactic starter culture. After an hour rennet is added. When the curd is firm, it is ground down to marble-sized bits which are heated to 100 degrees F. The whey is discarded and it is sliced into slabs. The curd is pressed overnight and stands for 4 days in a cool atmosphere. Unlike other well known cheeses, Cheddar's name is not protected so it has been used and abused by many producers around the world.
