Not like cow shit or anything, but like, crazy shit... that goes on... and you can't really do anything about it... Sometimes I don't see why relationships occur, because they usually just end up hurting people.  Yeah, they are fun to get in to, and I'm sure I'll have more in my life time because it is natural, I just don't see why people deal with the shit that goes on.  Guess its natural.  Yeah, well I guess it's a good thing that stuff doesn't always work out, because this world would be crazy as hell if it did.  America would be gone, the South would own Africa, Indians would be scalping Whitee because he stole their land... well, everyone out there reading this, wish me luck, this is all i have for now.
