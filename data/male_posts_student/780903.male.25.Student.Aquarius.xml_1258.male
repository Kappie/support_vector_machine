I'd read some reviews (that link is to the Rotten Tomatoes site), and they were pretty much all glowing, and I was really excited about seeing the movie.  But I didn't get it.  For me, it didn't work.  It was scattered, the characters were unsympathetic, it just didn't do it for me.  Not fun to sit through.  Oh well.
