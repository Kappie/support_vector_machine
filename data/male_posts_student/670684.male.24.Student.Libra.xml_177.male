It's actually not too terrible; I drank two before the euphora of new cheap beer wore off.  The best thing about Lucky is its container; there are no cans of lucky, just Red-Stripe bottles, and the beer comes in an industry-standard cardboard box, making the purchaser look like a party thrower or conissuer of fine things that are best bought in bulk.    Of course, if you've ever tasted Lucky, you just think this person is a cheap ass.    The cheap beer story - I really don't have anything specific.  I remember one instance where Daniel Harr and I were talking beer, and he mentioned Stroh's, at the time the shittiest beer he had tasted, a concoction so vulger its can was half red, half blue, with the word STROH'S on it.  My beer of choice at the time was Sapporo, an expensive Japanese brew found at sushi restaurants that makes a good double-switch with saki and california roll.  Anyway, while the conversation went on, I sat in wonderment of this famed shit beer that only Harr truly knew.    Today, I don't drink all that good of beer, and when I do, I really don't like it.  High Life is the standard; I like how the tall boy feels in my hand, I like how I look when I'm holding one, I like how I talk to people as I sip and smile...I just need the wife-beater, chaw, farmers tan, and pot belly to get in one of those commercials, slapping brisket or changing up the ring in a toilet bowl.  But when I can find something worse, I go for it.  Worse is Pabst Blue Ribbon, Extra Gold, or the Beast.  Busch doesn't really get any love in my court, and if you try to be cool and mention Natty Light (when I get on a cheap beer tirade and someone says "Hey, I drink Natty Light," I want to kick them in the face indiscriminately...have you no adventure?), I won't even smile and nod...it's straight onto my fical roster.    But the truly bad beer seems to be regional or specialty; it's as tough to find the crap as it is the love.  And those who are willing to look can find gold:  Stroh's, Olympia, Hamm's, and now Lucky.  These are the beers that sell cheaper than soft drinks, the ones that get you the, "alright, chico, you go have that party and i'll stay right here" look from the 45 year old counter attendent who was checking you out once you walked in, wetting her lips for a rendezvous in the backroom on top of a crate of Corona.    At Trudy's on my 23rd birthday, I was offered the customary free birthday drink.  I asked for the cheapest beer they had.  A seductress who now dates a good friend conned me into getting some sort of margarita with lots of alcohol, but when that was tapped, it was on to the crap.    When I worked at UT-Arlington, I was clocked at 93 words per minute.  It was the fastest time ever clocked by human resources there.  As I work on my writing and film and self, I realize that I am better at typing than I am at anything else.
