First period was supposed to be spent studying mental illness. The library has only two books on mental illness and both of them were missing. Wasted first period. Then in second period stupid Bennet (DT teacher) wouldn't let me in the computer room for "research" because i was on msn groups last DT lesson. Stupid Jason was sitting next to me the previous lesson doing the exact same thing and he got to go in. Again stupid Bennet. Spent the whole period in B8 doing shat all. Wasted second period. Stupid genetics test. Opened the paper to short answer and the question was "define the following terms- gene". WAP! Dammit, what the hell is a GENE. James Kim showed me a cool site. www.tekzoned.com Go there and do all the fun things on the site. So failed that one.
