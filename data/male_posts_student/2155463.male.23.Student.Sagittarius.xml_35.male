Things have been pretty maniacal with school lately (especially for her, Ms. Med-School and all :P), so it was really nice to be able to take a little break from it all.  Plus, she's just a really cool person to hang out with... :)  LOL...we ended up going to COSI, and I swear I haven't been to one of them in ages (actually, I didn't even realize that they had them anyplace other than Columbus!).  We both agreed that in our "advanced age" it would be more fun if we had younger kids with us (I just love the amazement on their faces - older kids, including myself, have such a harder time actually being surprised by anything, or at least actually showing it - I have a quote on my background rotation which says, "The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder," and I totally think this is true).  But there was some really cool stuff...I especially love anything that kinda makes you question your perceptions of reality, and they had some really cool stuff that did exactly that (in more of a physics-oriented fashion, not necessarilty philosophically :-P).  When I got home I started to work on my internship application for D.C., and I have to admit that I LOVE the way they have structured their essay.  Instead of the dumb "tell us about yourself" type, they give you a facts set and you have to write a defensive position for your "client," including what your investigation would be, who you would question, what evidence you would look for, etc.  Of course, there's a couple ambigious words that I have to write the internship direct about so my essay isn't about 10 pages long (there are a LOT of variables in the scenario they give us), but I definitely love this kind of stuff...  Oh, and when I got back my brother wanted to go see the Matrix: Revolutions, so I checked online to see when it was playing.  Under the title it sayed "ID Required," and that kinda sent up a red-flag for me for taking my brother (he's 16) - we had some problems last time we took him to Reloaded.  Anyway, he called up Cinemark - in one of the dumbest rules I think I've ever heard of, the only way that he could get in (being under 17 and it being a rated "R" movie) would be with our ACTUAL parents.  Never mind the fact that I'm 22 and could take him driving...nope, I could get sued for him crashing a car, but I can't take him into a movie.  Geesh...
