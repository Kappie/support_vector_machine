There's crying man, all he does is cry and cry, there's Skitzo, and when he's up, you can never understand what she's thinking. Then there's conspiracy theorist, and no matter what you say, if he's got the mike, she's going to think you're saying she's fat or ugly. The last guy is a midget. He's in a straight jacket and he's all black and blue because the others beat up on him so much. He's logic man. The trick to understanding, and communicating with a woman, is to know who has the mike.  all of today conspiracy theorist was in control in my head. And whenever Logic man tried to take it from him, he got bashed in the head with the mike. And instead of realizing it myself, I just went all out and ate this guy alive. Poor Austin had no idea he said anything. And he even apologized a million times and I wouldn't take it. Because Logic Man wasn't in control. I finally told him I was sorry for being a freak and being immature. But he didn't respond.  Maybe, just maybe he wised up and realized that maybe I'm not worth all the trouble I give him. In some ways, I hope he did (for his sake of course). But on the other hand, I want a second chance, to not be such a moron.  All I'm trying to say, and this is mainly for the girls, guys don't process things the way we do. I know you've heard that a million times. But trust me, I just figured it out today first hand. And it's an experience you don't want to have. So just know when they're joking. And if you want them to be serious, you kinda have to tell them. And when you're talking to someone online, be careful, because with out the tone of voice and facial expressions, it is really hard to understand what someone is saying. Be careful. And give your guy friends some extra space.  and guys? do the same thing for the girls. Because sometimes we're stupid and we take things personally when we shouldn't. Just give us some time, and we'll be okay again.
