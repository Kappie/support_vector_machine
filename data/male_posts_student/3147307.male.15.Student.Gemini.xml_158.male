In 1995, Mom began reading  The Magicians Nephew  out loud on our vacation. Yesterday, Mom finished reading  The Last Battle  out loud to us (Mom read most of it on the way home from Calvin) - so after 9 years we finished C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. I would have finished long ago, but Mom never let us read the books on our own (she wanted to read them all to us). Normally, we'll start reading one of the books over vacation, come home, finish it and not start again till next year with the next one (thus taking a long time). To put it in perspective, I remember in '95 (I was 6!) when Mom finished the first chapter (all I remember was that it was very confusing) and then afterward hearing about Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing (that was a long time ago). It has seemed kinda childish the past few years but my younger brothers enjoyed it (more than I did). Anyways, I had a question about blogs - is this  urlLink blog  Allison Cavanaugh's? - I'm not sure. If so, she will be added to my links and top blog lists (which will be posted today - back to the normal schedule of every Friday). If you're reading this, sorry I don't have a song, quote, or verse ready at the moment (I might come back and edit those in later).
