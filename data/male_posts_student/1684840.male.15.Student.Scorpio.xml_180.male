That felt quite cool, to be talked to... lol  Information Systems was okay, followed by and interesting lesson in Physics about how electricity is generated etc.  Not sure if anyone else likes Physics... but there you go. The science dept. are holding a small gathering for the Venus transit in the morning, which will be quite cool.  I'm still pondering on whether to go or not, although I probably will, with or without friends.  Sam suprised us in the dinner hall again by explaining how teachers are now reading the forum... *waves*    After school, Sam, Craig, Me, Chris and Zak went to town.  Our original plan was to get toally soaked and go swimming in the pool fully clothed.  Why?  Because we're mental that's why    Zak brought along a large rubber dinghy which was ridden along the river for a bit.  Our plan would have been great, hadn't a large group of bitch kiddies have been there annoying us and totally kicking the piss out of Kayla.  In the end we called the Police but they ran off... pussies!    I took a record of 101 pictures on my outing for Geography Coursework and just general photos of Stafford for memories.  I'm getting really excited now.  We could be leaving as early as July and to me it's great news, but to others it isn't because they like me so much lol (There's at least a whole month yet! lol)  Any day now, that approval notice is going to come through...
