I had my suspicions that the night would end up blowing goats, but never could i have forseen such blowage.  We were meant to be going to young Breebs' birthday bash at Rileys but when we showed up we noticed that half of those who were meant to be there hadn't got in as they had no membership and those who did get in were largely bawbags so we decided to make a sneaky exit and head to Franklyns. Imagine the dismay when we discovered that people were being ID'd. IN FRANKLYNS????????!!!!!!! The world had cleary gone topsy-turvy, so Captain Downey suggested we go back to his house for a few seeing as he has an empty, a novel idea we all thought.  However...Downey is clearly holding fort under aforementioned thumb and as soon as the wife cracked the whip all bets were off, plans were changed and it was now him and the missus goin back to his while me and Darren were left in the lurch a peach in Bellshill at half 11 with nowhere to go and no drink.  GIMP! I wouldnt even have minded so much if he had said at the start "sorry lads im going off with Lisa i'll see you later" but the fact that he asked us first then did a 180 as soon as the chance to poke the toalie-hole was offered up was just wide. Thats the kind of shit that really gets my goat, so to speak. FUCKING HELL. Ended up back at Darrens where we had a few beers, even phoned dial a drink but they were taking AGES and as i left at around 4 they still hadnt showed, compliants will be lodged, then watched some predictable teen comedy fluff before heading home. Plans being changed do not sit well!!! Especially when they turn out pure shite as tonights did. So ill end my little diatribe of Downey with a quote from sir Winston Churchill: "GROW SOME BALLS MY MAN!" Must dash, ta-ra.
