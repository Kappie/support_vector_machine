Speaking of the Queens, someone at MTV announced that the band showed up and Nick Oliveri was decked out in a dress and smeared make-up.  Words can't describe how much I wanted to see an interview.  Instead, the heads of programming decided to show Sean Paul preforming some reggae-tinged trash and orignally I thought that he should pay royalties to Bob Marley for all those damn Jamacan flags the audience were waving around, but in the end decided that any connection to Bob Marley would be disgraceful.  Moral of the story, Sean Paul is my new favorite hate.  Things didn't get much better when the actual show started.  Oh wait, Brittney made out with Madonna.  It didn't seem contrived at all.  Millions of guys began grabbing their junk and running to the bathroom within moments of said kiss.    Chris Rock killed and it was worth it.  My two favorite lines from the proceeds were (and I'm paraphrasing) "The Olsen twins are here, and they had to seat R. Kelly up there (points to balcony)" (I don't think I'll ever get sick of R. Kelly jokes and/or golden shower jokes about R. Kelly) and "Good Charlotte, more like a mediocre Green Day."  How the truth hurts.    In the meantime, 50 Cent looked thuggish and was one of the better performers of the evening, not based on singing tallent, but for the fact he emerged from a Pimp Cup (in what could have been a truly Spinal Tap moment).  Althougth I don't think it was his intention, Mr. Cent pulled off the theme of "pimp" well by coming from said cup, and having real pimps on stage.  Bravo.   Better yet, Mr. Cent (how awesome is that name?) had Snoop on stage with his "spiritual advisor" Don Magic Juan.  For those of you who don't know, Don Magic Juan is one of the most famous Pimps of all time and used to live in Chicago's West Side, where he drove a teal Bentley.  Nothing like keeping a low profile.  But Snoop's best performance wasn't on stage, it came earlier in the evening when he WALKED WOMEN DOWN THE RED CARPET ON LEASHES LIKE DOGS!!!!!!!! (or bitches if you will).  I surprised N.O.W. hasn't had his head.  Then again, he's Snoop.    Overall, the most entertaining part was the red carpet because of the sheer ludicrisness of entrences made by rappers.  OutKast gets an honorable mention for showing up with a flatbed pickup adorned with a stripper pole and strippers.    Overall, I was disapointed, no Johnny Cash and you would think that a building that holds DMX and ODB would result in something scandalous, yet all that occured was a plug for DMx's new album "Grand Champ" coming out Sept. 16.  So important that I marked it in my I Book.  As much as I wanted to see Johnny Cash lay waste to all others, I held hope that Metallica could do something cool.  And they still could, it just didn't happen at the show.  After hyping the fact that "they're gonna do something special at the end" all we got was a shitty lounge-actesque run through the riffs of "are you gonna go my way?," "smells like teen spirit," "beat it," and "seven nation army."  Didn't even get to see the Trujillo dance.  For the record, Audioslave did a cover of "seven nation army" at Lolla.  Anywho, I still held hope, but all Metallica did was "Frantic," the best song off the new album, but that's like getting a cold instead of the clap...that analogy sounded better in my head.  Point is, new stuff doesn't rock like "Creeping Death."  I suppose my hopes were raised because while watching the VMA's last year, when I remarked to my roomie that the only way the show could get better was if Gn'R played.  They did, and played "Paradise City."  Metallica should have taken notes.  My roomate and I speculated that this year could have been better only if Black Sabbath or Rush showed up.  Neither did, hence the disapointment.  Think that's about it. Wait.  Beyonce drank a Pepsi in the middle of her set, ushering an entirely new low in product placement and advertisment.   And Good Charlotte won a Viewer's Choice, once again proving pre-teen girls know how to effectively dial a phone number and lack any taste in music whatso ever.
