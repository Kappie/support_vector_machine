I have to admit that I’m a quite sad to see it go. Although I may have not been able to accomplish all that I had set out for myself to do this year, I have enjoyed it; even with all the unexpected ups and downs.   Speaking of unexpected ups…I had the delight of attending a secondary school classmate’s wedding dinner over the weekend. It seemed like a school reunion with all the old familiar faces showing up, although there were many that were…missed.  I find it unfortunate that I was not able to catch up as well as I would have liked with everyone who was there. I guess one reason was that huge dinners like these are not really conducive to speaking what with all the eating going on. Or it could be that I was constantly interrupted with discussion of my “antics” in the good ole days. Regardless, it was all agreed that we never thought that our schoolmate in question would be one of the first to get married. Time flies indeed.      >     Holidays are here again and it’s good to be able to kick back and enjoy it. Lord knows that things are going to be ramped up come next year, so I had better enjoy this one as much as I can. While I do have some major items to look into the next few days, I’m looking forward to about 2 solid weeks of festive celebrations, complete with shopping, outing and Christmas right smack in the middle of it.  I plan to make it a good one. Cheers!
