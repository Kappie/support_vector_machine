(he was supposed to be sticking around until monday). i called him and found out that he decided to pack up and go back to colorado. i guess being back here away from the army was making him kind of depressed. not that he missed the army, but being here reminded him how much he wanted to not be in active duty anymore. so he's gone...  and then i was supposed to go snowboarding with jake and derek on monday, but not derek is gone and jake wants to spend monday studying...  oh welll....  on the brightside, i actually found a group to go clubbing...yeah....maybe there is hope in this valley of ours....unfortunately not all my friends can make it...i'll prolly bring my cam and take some pics
