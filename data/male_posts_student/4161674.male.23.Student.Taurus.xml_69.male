I'd like to make the case for the idea that maybe a musical artist is NOT the best person to write his or her own liner notes for an album reissue.  Case in point...one of my all-time favorite albums:  Electric Light Orchestra's 1981 album, "Time".  Now bear in mind that I have loved this album since its original release some twenty-odd years ago.  Beyond the obvious science-fiction angle, I love the various themes this 'concept album' explores.  Ostensibly the tale of a man mystically transported through time into a future world some 1000 years from now, the lyrics and music - in my humble opinion - transport the listener into a whole other 'reality'.  The album explores such themes as the protagonist's fear of this 'Brave New World' he finds himself in (in the song "Twilight"); his discovery of the emptiness of a relationship with a beautiful 'replicant' woman ("Yours Truly, 2095"); his desperate longing for his lost love ("Ticket to the Moon"); his aversion to the changes he sees in the futuristic landscape ("The Way Life's Meant To Be"); and - despite his feeling of not 'fitting in' ("21st Century Man") - his eventual acceptance of the time period he finds himself stranded in ("Hold On Tight").  So given that lofty concept and the truly fantastic music that accompanies it, you can imagine my delight when I discovered that there was a newly-released 're-do' of the original "Time" available - this one featuring three rare 'B-sides', complete digital re-mastering, AND liner notes from bandleader Jeff Lynne himself!  ...FINALLY...an insight into what inspired this masterful tale of a man trapped in a destiny he did not make!!!  SURELY, thought I,  the master himself - Jeff Lynne - will enlighten this eager acolyte with tales of the origins of - and deeper meaning of - this pop-rock masterpiece!  ....Well........  Here is a sampling of some of Jeff's wisdom - on a song-by-song basis....  ************************************************************************************* "Yours Truly, 2095":  ...Typical, it's about a bloke who falls for a robot.  Say no more.  "Ticket to the Moon": ....Drama in space.  "Rain Is Falling": ...I think it's about some scientists trying to mess about with time.  But it's quite a nice tune.  "21st Century Man": ...About someone who is lost.   AND FINALLY...his overview of the whole "Time" project in toto: ...This was one of them concept ideas.  It was about time travel, so it's supposed to be all futuristic and daft.  None of these ideas have been disproved yet, and only another ninety-odd years to go to see if I was right!  *************************************************************************************  Yeah....bit of a letdown, wouldn't you say?  (And please don't call me Shirley!)
