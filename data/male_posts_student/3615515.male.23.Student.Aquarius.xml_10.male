One only has to take a look at the PGP1s slogging out in the lib, having involved discussions over their projects and assignments to remind oneself that we, the PGP2s, were also once like them.   I look around me today to see what my batchmates and I are doing and all that I see is fraud and more fraud. Across all subjects, our profs are wondering why is it that we don’t come prepared for case discussions anymore, why is it that we don’t do any assignments, why is it that all our project reports are just google searches conducted in a few hours while they should have been in-depth analysis’s reflecting our learning in the last one year. Some of these profs who have taught us in the first year are absolutely clueless as to what could have gone so wrong that the same set of students who used to be so attentive till last year find the lectures soporific these days. One year is a short time to change people’s attitude. Yet, a lot has changed in the last one year.   Let me look at myself and the people around me to get some perspective. When I came to IIML, I was this high enthu guy, determined to make my stay at L worthwhile, determined to take charge of my studies, my projects and work hard towards a really good CG. In no time, I had already got the reputation of a muggu, a guy who would do the project work alone if nobody else contributed. But I was very lucky in the first term - I had a really good project group. Although, I took charge of almost all the projects, the others contributed really well. In fact, we were so happy with the composition that we continued with almost the same group throughout the year. Our project group from second term onwards was one that could be envied – we were four studs and one hard working idiot (yours truly!). I took a tremendous amount of pride in my project group. It was not just that we all did good work and were dependable, it was also that we were five people who were ready to accept our mistakes as and when we made them and then rectify those mistakes. The brainstorming sessions for our various projects would be very satisfying - the ideas that came up, the analysis that we did were truly commendable. As time passed, our projects became more structured, more in-depth, and more presentable. This progress that we saw in ourselves was really satisfying. The point that I’m trying to make is that I was in the company of people who were really good, sincere students and good people and it was as if we would always remain this good group, who would do everything we ever took up well. And yet, it all changed. I am no longer the high enthu guy that I used to be, and I can see that the killer instinct with which my group used to attack our projects is missing. We no longer take up our projects as challenges; they’re more like burdens on our shoulders. What went wrong? Some would say its burnout but I doubt it. Post summers, we, as a batch, seem to have lost respect for the institution that is IIML. We seem to believe that this institute is not as great as it is made out to be, we seem to believe that we are all real studs and that we’ll show our studness directly in the industry because our courses are not worth working hard for. We seem to believe that exams can no longer test our true potential and hence any exam that screws us is actually flawed itself – and we find really good excuses to screw up our exams. Forget about the exams, whatever happened to our project presentations, assignments, case discussions?  Well, all I can say is that these days when I see the PGP1s, there is this feeling of regret that comes up in my heart that I no longer have the same zeal in my eyes that I see in theirs. All I can say is that these days I sometimes try to reignite the fire within and keep failing and then keep trying again. And I wonder whether I’ll be able to do it by the end of this year because one year is a short time to change people’s attitude. Yet, since a lot has changed in the last one year, I can always hope that a lot will change in the next one year, hopefully for the better.
