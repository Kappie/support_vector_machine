Toward the end of the service, as we were singing the closing song for the service, I was trying to capture every moment inmy heart. On looking back, it has been two wonderful years serving as a singer in church, and certainly, I have gained a lot as I serve, not just in terms of techniques or skills, but most of all, a revelation of what is it to be like as aworshipper of Jesus Christ. Over the endless hours of training, I got to know many new friends who provided me with a fresh outlook on life.   Well,certainly, as this door closes, hopefully, another door will open....
