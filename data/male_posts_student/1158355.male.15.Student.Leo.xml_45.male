Kate, Britt, Dan, Chris and I were playing with the spongebob blow up kickball in the road and Britt kicks it up from the across the street neighbor's house and BOOM! It hits the top of an old man and women's 1980's maroon shit mobile. The man gets out blabberin and cussin and we're cracking up. I told the man it was a racoon and Kate said it was a bird but he didn't fall for it so I said it was a run by fruiting by an unknown man who seemed to have escaped the crime scene by jumping the fence of the neighbor's yard. He started to approach me and that's when I started to freak out. Imagine this, an old Mafia man approaching you with a cane. Yes, it was horrifying and gross. But... luckily he turned around, checked for any dents and right before he entered the car he said, "Was that a stone?" Ok, you had to hear how he said it. So they drove away and the parents of course think its me. YES, IT WASN'T ME FOR ONCE! We also  went to the park near my cousin's house and my sister started histerically crying just because she was bored, it was the weirdest thing ever. Then we avoided Kate and her dum gangster friends who all smoke. So basically everything the whole day was great until track fucking came up. My fuckin mom had to fuckin mention that I had track 7 in the morning just to get me started. Just to fuckin piss me off, to ruin my whole night because that's what her fuckin mom does also. She has to get that little fuckin thing in that gets Dad started on it and saying how you SHOULD MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE FUCKING TEAM... ya know what, I'll do what I want and since this a free fuckin country, I'll make my commitment when I want, not over the fuckin vacation but during school, and coach can go suck my dick. So because of my mom mentioning track, my dad yells at me, and now he's fuckin not taking me out tomorrow to get clothes. And to top it all off, the first message on the fuckin answering machine is the Almighty and Great Paulsome with the "Hey.. uhh.. tom...I was wondering if you were...uh...going to...track." Of course Paul had told me in school he had soccer and couldn't make any of the track practices so that's what I told my parents. But of course Paul changes his mind and decides to go to track and that leads to my parents thinking IM FUCKING LYING TO THEM! So you know what? I can't take this shit anymore, I feel like I can't do what I want to do. And that's exactly what it is. So for now on, fuck you if you think you can change me. Fuck you if you wanna change me. For now on, I'm me and I'll do whatever I want, and for now on, I don't care if it's the wrong thing and nobody else is agreeing with it, I choose for myself. If I want to moon my coach, I'll do it. If I want to burn down a few trees, I'll do it. Good night... don't worry tomorrow I'll be all better.  "Fuck it all, fuck this world, fuck everything that you stand for. Don't belong, don't exist, don't give a shit. Don't ever judge me." - Corey Taylor from Slipknot
