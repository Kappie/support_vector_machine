In my last atricle you saw the equation 20 seconds times x amount of commercials times 4 breaks (estimate) divided by 60 to get your total minutes you get taken out of your show so heres how it comes together with 6 commercials. 6 x 20= 120 x 4 = 480/60= 8. 8 minutes of your life you won't get back and spent absorbing corporate propaganda.
