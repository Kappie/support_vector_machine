I always envisioned that, if my life were a T.V. sit-com, I would play the part of a minor character, most likely comic relief and the kind of character that just kind of tagged along with the main characters and made a joke every now and then.  It’s nice to feel wanted.  I like that feeling.  I hope it happens again.
