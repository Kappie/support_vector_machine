Pete seemed pretty happy to see me and i hadn't been in awhile so was good to fence at that caliber. I mean i fence meredith and Jason at NJFA and i don't seem to be as motivated. The other day i faced them in a team sabre match. My team lost(Matt and Harrison fenced really well)but I still went 3-0 beating mer 5-0 and jason 5-3. Mer thinks i just got better but intruth ive always seemed to take it easy on her, and jason, well he just get's upset when i beat him, same with rob. Truth is i beleive at times im better. I want the success more, not to sound cocky. I get insulted when i beat jason and he goes "I'm fencing like crap." It's marrissa and nicole who alway make my day. When they fence me, win or lose they compliment and encourage me.   But back to what i was originally saying. I went to Foundation and i kicked some ass. I saw Ibti there and she was happy to hear i made captain. I dominated in my first bout but my big bout was the second. I fenced Kianati(not sure if the spelling is right) he is one nasty fencer. We always seem to have fun when we fence and i've become much closer to him than i have the others(even davidson). i won this time, I think he won the last time though. My third bout was a mess...I fenced davidson again. i lost 5-0 i beat him last week,ugh. But that wasn't what really upset me. there's this one fencer who's really good...short but really quick. Acouple weeks back I told Pete when i saw him in the city that my team had won the state cahmpionship. He mentioned it during one of my bouts(big mistake).That one kid took it to tounge. Everytime i fenced he would talk "some state champion you are." It really got me when i fenced ross, since i lost so badly. I was pleased with the way I held my temper in. In a way I'm happy I lost because it gave the kid the courage to challenge me. I don't remember the score but i won. I earned his respect. I seemed to earn everyon's respect. All ready had Kianati's respect though. I guess skill and talent equal respect.
