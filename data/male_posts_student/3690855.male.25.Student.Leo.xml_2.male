I'm updating out of sheer boredom more than anything else.  The last two days have been uneventful.  I worked on Tuesday.  Still don't like working in Morrisville.  I tend to get out later, and plus I worked as a driver on Tuesday under this guy Don.  Don used to be the manager when I worked in Robbinsville originally, then left.  Then I became manager in Robbinsville years later.  Now we're working together again, only I feel as though I'm much better at Don (since I'm younger and have more energy).  This cannot possibly make for a good dynamic down the line.  We'll see what happens.  Today I had off.  I spent the day avoiding my dad, who was in a grumpy mood because, according to him, my mom won't let him spend more than $3,000 on a car.  My mom contends this is a fabrication.  I love my dad, but sometimes he imagines things in his head that simply are not so.  Then he spends hour upon hour moping about them.  I got out of the house, went window shopping for a while, then inexplicably bought a PC version of Monopoly at Best Buy for $10.  Hey, I loved playing Monopoly as a child, and $10 is pretty cheap.  I went to Subway today and bought a Grapeade just to see if the world's most attractive sandwich artist still worked there.  She does, but she looked younger than I previously remembered, like fifteenish.  Oh well, no more random Grapeade purchases there.  I also got a haircut.  I'm the kind of lazy bastard that gets about four haircuts a year.  It's my opinion that I should grow my hair out to a reasonable legnth before going to the trouble of cutting it.  Plus, I'm cheap.  I then came home and listened to my dad bitch and moan about this and that for a few hours before he went to bed.  Then I played some Monopoly (I have no life, remember, my friends never want to do anything) and updated this.  Tomorrow should be an interesting day.  Well, at least more interesting than today.  I have a 2:45 PM appointment with my Senior Seminar professor.  In lieu of classes, the class is meeting with her one-on-one.  We will be discussing my progress on our big paper, or lack thereof.  Actually, I will pretend I'm making progress on said paper and hope she doesn't realise that I'm full of shit.  Then at 6 PM that night, that's when the magic happens.  The Cox Show will beam out to listeners in the Monmouth and Ocean county areas in New Jersey, and live on the internet at www.wmcx.com.  This week, I plan on discussing who I feel should be the new PA announcer for the New Jersey Nets, my usual unusual takes on weather and traffic, somewhat-live NBA draft coverage...and definitely, DEFINITELY more Chingy.  After that, I may try to kill three more hours (or just stay on the radio, as nobody comes on after me and I doubt anybody would notice or care that I'm staying on the air) and see a 12:01 showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 at Monmouth Mall.  It looks like it will be at least an interesting movie and I look forward to seeing it.  I guess I got some mileage out of this after all.  I'm starting to get the hang of this and I think I'm starting to like it.  Which means I will now not update for like three weeks.  But maybe not, so check back again later this week.  I have no current weekend plans (I work Friday and Saturday nights, and Sunday I'm off with nothing to do) so we'll see if I get a weekend update (but NOT with fake news, sadly) in there.  Until then, you keep it real, holmes.
