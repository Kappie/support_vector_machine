Someone who you helped and stuck your neck out for in times when no one else would and you didn't really want to but since they were your friend you did..  This is my problem right now..  I stuck my neck out for Sieckman for years..  When no one else wanted anything to do with him I was there for him..  When he screwed me by fucking up MY car I let it slide because I was afraid of the consequences for him with his parents and with his whole life...  Now when things are on the other foot he seems to show no remorse in doing everything he can to screw me over..  he could treat me as a friend and do everything he can to get this matter resolved painlessly and effeciently..  I am doing everything in my power to get the situation fixed as soon as possible so that it can be resolved and move on..  When he doesn't put himself in other peoples positions or even look at the things that they have done for him in the past it makes me wonder why I ver hung out with him in the first place and really just makes me want to get the situation over with so I never have to have anything to do with him again...  I feel sorry for him because I don't think he realizes that by his actions he is alienating the few people who have ver stood by him and stood up for him when his life was real shitty..  Ohh well I guess friends aren't as important to him as to me and that is why he will be without very many for a good long while...  All decisions have consequences and i am dealing with mine and it's hard but I don't know if he realizes the impact his decisions will have on him..  Some people have different priorities..   I am reminded of the quote "A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out."
