Ateneo was down by as much as 20 in the 2nd quarter and still had a double-digit disadvantage in the 3rd quarter. I went to mass then thinking that Ateneo will have a 4-1 record when I get back. But then, something REALLY wierd happened, Ateneo won! I called my friend Jason up then he said Ateneo won. I was too surprised to ask by how many but DAMN, how did that happen? (oh ya, I was chattin with Rolf when I was typing this and he said Ateneo won by 3, a 3-pointer by Tenorio in the last 8 seconds). [Ateneo 58, Adamson 55]  I'm glad that Ateneo won but not that glad since DLSU is not doing that well.  Cardona= OFFENSIVE IDOL!!!       Another miracle, although it was pretty stupid, was the FEU-NU game. It was close, which was a surprise because FEU is seen as the stronger team, way stronger. The game goes to overtime, to the delight of Ray Mendoza. In the end of overtime, he misses 2  VERY  important free throws that was supposed to give NU the win because they were tied at 85. After the miss, Don Yabut gets the ball then at the  BUZZER , he was fouled by a rookie from NU (I don't care about the name coz he was  STUPID ) Well, Yabut hits 1 free throw and FEU wins 86-85. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  ARWIND SANTOS=DEFENSIVE IDOL!!!    *CELEBRATE*  *CELEBRATE*
