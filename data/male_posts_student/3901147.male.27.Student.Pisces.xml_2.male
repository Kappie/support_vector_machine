So I go back and look and look and I don't see the glasses in the completed area. I look and look and finally one of the girls find it in the (on order) side of the lab. The order had been placed late friday night when the labs were all closed and the labs are not open during the weekend. Therefore, the glasses don't get ordered till mondayand most glasses take a week to a week and a half to come in. The day was Wednesday! I go back and and say, "Man, the glasses order was placed late friday night so they didn't get ordered till monday.. it takes at least 5 to 7 business days to get a pair back from the lab..." her response is took look at me with the vacuous blank look and say, "The time has gone bye! I am here to pick up his glasses.." Mam it has only been on order for two days and the lab is in Kansas City and they just got the order next day as of yesterday. "The time has gone bye and I am here to pick up the glasses!!!" Well mam... they aren't here so you are gonna have to just come back on another day!  She I walk off and leave her sitting there and she eventually leaves...  WTF!!
