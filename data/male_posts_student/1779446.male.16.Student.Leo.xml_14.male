Actually, I take that back, almost all of these posts are garbage.  So what have I been upto lately?  There was a teacher strike on thursday so me and David Kang went to the city. Basically we went insane, watched a movie and did some lanning, well technically that's what we were supposed to do.  Anyways, it was generally a cool day, we talked, went to comic book stores, ate food, laughed at David Kangs expense and bummed around in the arcade which brings me to my next point, why AZN's are stupid. It's not that I am racist, I'm an Asian for goodness sakes, I jsut dislike the clique of Asians with bleached hair, type with CaPiTALZ in DiFF PlaCES LOL and play DDR and act all hard and read Manga and worship Japan.   They are:   F U G L Y.  Well most of them are. The guys are skinny assed gaunt guys with shades and too long hair. I bet not a sinle one of them have a pube's whiff of a dick, nor a dick at all.  It's been a mad week, but I had a bout of depression. It's over now, and I'll probably be going to Hansen's house tommorow for a sleep over. ANYWAYS, AZN's annoy me, possibly because I encounter a WHOLE damn group of them loitering around the arcade, trying to look cool. Another incident that stands out was the whole Koala woman thing. You see, we encountered a woman dressed in a white mask in the shape of a koala's face. Ok, moving on, as we walked towards the QVB, David Kang exclaimed "What the shit?" thus, attracting her attention and prompting her to strike at david with the strange stick thing she had, causing both Ali and David to say "OH SHIT!" in wet fear simultaneously. It doesn't sound that funny, but I was laughing so much I almost shat my pants when it happened.  Logging off for now, Colin.
