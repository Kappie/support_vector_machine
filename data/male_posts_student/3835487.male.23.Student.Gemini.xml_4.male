I don't know what that says about my life...perhaps I really enjoy movies or nothing exciting happened to me today so a movie is the best I have to offer. Anyway, I thought the movie was  great . I don't know if it quite lives up to the  hype  that surrounds it, but it's definitely one of the best things that I've seen in a while. People are calling it the best action movie ever, but I don't really see it as an action movie, it has more of a human element to it. An action movie to me is something like  The Transporter . I would recommend this movie and go so far as to say that it's the best movie that I've seen in a while, but like I said, I don't know if anything can live up to a  97 percent  on  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes . The only downside of the movie is that the  Green Goblin  will be back in the next one. I think they should keep it fresher than that, but maybe they will prove me wrong. That, and the fact that  Hal Sparks  was in the movie for about twenty seconds during an elevator ride.  Since when is  Lance Armstrong  dating  Sheryl Crow ? I gotta think that's a pretty good score for him. I'd like to see a picture of his  ex-wife  just for comparison...  Has anyone ever noticed how  fantasy sports  get boring about halfway through? It's like I'm just going through the motions now on my baseball team. I much prefer playing   urlLink City of Heroes  . My character,  Mesocyclone , is now a Level 14 defender. That's about 47 hours of playing time. Just for your information, she manipulates the weather and radiation. I think I need to get out more or something. I always used to make fun of people who played  Everquest  all day but now I'm no different. Well...I'm still different because I don't play ALL day...maybe 2 hours a day.   Apparently  NASCAR  couldn't find a better grand marshal for their race than  Byron Leftwich . I mean he's a good QB, but has he really reached  grand marshal status ? Or even Waco Marshal status?  That's it for now. Next time will be better. I  promise .  Peace.  Alex
