I was happy because I was tired of putting on the same stuff for almost the whole week long.You'd think this was the greatest day ever, but as usual, good things don't last too long. It turned out that all of my friends pay attention to Joan Rivers. I had worn this really comfortable Old Navy stuff that I always wear. EVERYONE had on jeans and a t-shirt.Or at least 500 of them. That's more than one-third of the school. So I was like who cares , since what matters most is comfort. Almost everyone was commenting about clothes. That is the worst conversational subject I could think of. There are tons of stuff going on that affect the way we live. Yet people chose to talk about things that don't matter for anything at all. If you were stranded on a deserted island w/ only 2 outfits to choose from to conceil your shame, would you rather wear the latest fall fashions or some sport pants and a really comfy shirt of some sort? Only the queen of crappy talkshow Joan rivers would choose the fasionable piece of shit that is probably dry clean only and would get dirty on the sand and dust of that island. And if you are going to talk about, eeeeeeeewwwww.......fashion, then at least have the decency to not put down others for what they wear.  Why make others feel bad because they don't wear what's hot. Call that what you will, fashion inspection, clothing review. All I see is another form of segregation.
