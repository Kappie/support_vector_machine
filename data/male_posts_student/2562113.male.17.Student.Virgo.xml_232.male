I can't believe how beautiful the girls are down there; it's such a cocktease. And I only got sunburned ONCE! HA!!!  Everyone needs to thank Reza for throwing the bash at his house and putting up with shit last Saturday night. Your efforts do not go unappreciated my friend...  And oh yeah...this weekend is going to be sick!!! Mad people are coming up to visit and it's gonna be like 80 degrees. Can't wait!  -BIGsmut
