I really have never thought of them as creepy either... except Bozo the clown... he was kinda creepy. Anyway...  New topic of discussion... a little deeper... a bit of philosophy.    The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality. If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover.    True or False?
