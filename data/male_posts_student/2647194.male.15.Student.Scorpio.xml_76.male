Drowning in sorrow lost in grief I suspected that it was too brief Too short to think Not enough time To try and make my feelings rhyme  I made a mistake So what? Big deal? I thought that it would surely heal I had no previous experience No guru to consult I wish I had just thought this through But now myself I insult  I once thought myself a wiseman Yet now I know I am not The knowledge I seek, to reap and to keep Cannot be bought or sold  And so I ask, in the name of God fogiveness for my sin Yet now I know, for whom the bell tolls I simply cannot win  A drop of sadness A drip of pain A gush of madness Its all rain Rain filling my bucket Filling my soul Flooding my conscience in a never-ending bowl  The deluge will not cease The torrent will not stop I cannot slow its ruining of my mental crop  I wish it never started I wished it to never end There could not be any death if birth was not to send a message to the world something bold something fresh  With haste, swift haste I close the curtain and the sash Curtain to tatters Sash to ash  And so, on cue I bid adieu to but one of all the rest  And so, on cue I bid adieu to the one that I know best   I never knew I could write like that.
