I really wished I had more time to train but I have no choice because if I take it after this week, I will be charged for S$50 for not taking it before my birthday(from what I heard from a friend). The last time I took it, which was like almost  10 months ago , I failed it because of my running. Sob Sob...Physical fitness had never been my forte but recently I decided to adopt a healthy lifestlye, not only to look and feel good, but most importantly to have a healthy body to perform my daily tasks with ease and charm.  The thing that worries me the most is the  2.4km station ! I went training recently by attempting to run 6 rounds about the track(which is 2.4km for your info) and guess what...my engine broke down at the 4th run. Seems like I am still a distance to my target! However, I came up with a strategy recently for running my 2.4km to achieve my target of silver.   ROUND 1 : 1min 50s ROUND 2 : 2min 00s (3min 50s) ROUND 3 : 2min 10s (6min 00s) ROUND 4 : 2min 10s (8min 10s) ROUND 5 : 2min 00s (10min 10s) ROUND 6 : 1min 30s (11min 40s) Total   : 11min 40s(Silver)   Sounds easy and really boosted my confidence for achieving my target. But, I still have some doubts about running this timing. Hmm..seems like I may have to give it a try to see if it is possible. Anyway, a new Korean movie called Windstruck just came out. The female lead  Jun Ji Hyun  and Director of My Sassy Girl  Kwak Jae Yong  are involved in it. The whole thing sounds like a rip-off from  My Sassy Girl . But I don't mind watching it because of the pretty Jun Ji Hyun , hehehe.  The movie's about Kyungjin( starring Jun Ji Hyun ), a righteous but impulsive policewoman, who cannot allow any crime go unnoticed. Myungjoo( starring Jang Hyuk ), a newly-appointed teacher also shared her intolerance on crimes. Kyungjin and Myungjoo¡¯s paths crossed when both of them chased after a thief, interesting incidents happened when Kyungjin mistook Myungjoo as the culprit. A romantic yet hilarious relationship follows. On Kyungjin¡¯s many assignments, Myungjoo will always protect her from afar and help to safe the day. It was during one of Myungjoo¡¯s many attempts to protect Kyungjin when something irreversible and unimaginable happen¡­Catch the show if you are a fan of Korean movies!
