However, in the interest of simplicity, a friend of mine Scruff came up with an ingenious idea.  In times of trouble, Christians made half a sign of a fish, and if the other person didn't make the other half, they knew they were an enemy.  I'm thinking we need to have a similar way to find out hipsters.  Something along the lines of, "Being there was awesome."
