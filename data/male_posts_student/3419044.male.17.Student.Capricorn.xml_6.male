Not sure if I have mentioned this in previous posts or not, but it is very tiring and hard for me.  I have been doing stair climber for... 4 weeks now and this is about my second week doing both stair climber and elliptical.  When I first began doing both, I was dead tired and my legs were burning and sore.  Now, I work up a good sweat and it feels 'good'.    I was progressed today to jumping.  No, I am not allowed to do my dunks anymore, just jump rope height of jump.  I am supposed to try this one day, take a day off try it again.  If the knee joint tollerates that, I am allowed to run 1 minute, walk 1 minute.  Again, taking a day off inbetween.  But this is added a minute at a time.  Once I get up to 10 minutes or jog and 10 minutes of walk.  I am allowed to run freely for how long I wish.  After this, I can being lunges onto the operated knee. (cringe)  I am also allowed to mow lawns, so I can make more money with my little business. :D  I think we are getting a new lawn mower tomorrow so it will be easier to 'push' (self-propelled).  That is the current update on my knee.  I think it's time for me to shower... I smell after that physio and work-out on the Bowflex... M M M M M... rippedness... :)   urlLink    ACL Poster 1 of 3   urlLink    ACL Poster 2 of 3   urlLink    ACL Poster 3 of 3
