In otherwords... wes and james sprayed this like bug cleaner all over the place and now it smells really bad!... pretty sure we will be up all night. lol.... ok im gonna go cuz bret and wes are freaking out lol  *EDIT* Well.. its the next morning now and its as if we all got drunk. Cuz we were all pretty much hungover... even thought there was no alchohal at all.. but still we were all tired and didnt feel to good lol. As for the night... well... it started off by watching Ashley and Steph on webcam... not gonna go into the details of that event... then they got really boring and started to freak out so we moved on over to Miranda and Kristy.. now this was a happy fun time INDEED. They um.. turned on their webcam to say the least lol.... cant continue on from there cuz Miranda will kill me. lol after we made them sad for leaving them we pretty much all went to sleep. Well pretty much being me and james. Wes, Bret and Dimitri pretty much stayed up all night playing video games and watching movies. I on the other hand wanted my sleep because i wasnt feeling good and i still dont as im writing this. Need to go find some damn tyonhal.. (cant spell) anyway.. thats about it for this GREAT day... i wish everyday was like this... just without the hungover feeling lol
