I got Quackshot which some mug was selling for Â£2.99 Buy It Now, ha ha it's all mine. And I also go the above. Finally i have myself a copy of Super Street Fighter II     of course it's the megadrive version but at least I have it now. I actually remember at around the time of me having the Saturn i went into Electronics Buttock and saw the box for this game in the pre owned section, i was cheesing so i took it to the counter, i had been looking for a copy of this for ages likes. Of course the bloody sales boy couldn't find the game in the drawers and asked me to come back a little later so he could find it. I just said forget it. But here it is now. Of course I really could do with the SNES version but it seems that no ons going to give that to me for six quid.  I actualyl had a bit of a session on the Megadrive yesterday, went through all the games and played a little of each. I usually forget I have a Megadrive mainly because when i got it it was just a replacement for the SNES which got nicked off me so it would never measure up. I bought it second hand off David Lynch who was one of my friends in School, he used to smell a lot of sweat cos he was a big lad and his parents were heavy smokers so when i got the console my room just smelt like his it was an absolute nightmare. And now it seems that the actual games still smell like that cos i rarely take them out of their boxes. Also the games never load when you plug them in and turn on for the first time, I always have to take them out blow on the connectors (not sure if that's wise actually) and plug them back in firmly. Anyway what have i got?    Alien Storm  - This game isn't as good as I remembered it, i guess it's fun when you play it with someone else but on my own it only serves for nostalgic value, which was why i also bought the Master System version recently, this Megadrive cart was one of Lynchys though.    Alisia Dragoon  - This is another of Davids games which is shit. I'm not sure why he got it but I'm suspecting it's because he fancies the character you control, ahem. It's just this shitty platform game where you blast flying creatures with a big stick of lightning and you've go tthis dragon following you all the time.    Decap Attack  - I didn't play this because it's not in my posession right now. i sold 3 games to Speedy recently nd threw one in as a borrow but it's been a while since I have seen him and it could still be a while before i see him again as he may not be returning to college. Last time I saw him actually he was really down cos he had fucked up college and I may have sounded a little too proud that i had passed all the classes so a bit of a woops type situation there.    Ecco the Dolphin  - I actualyl had a bit of fun when i booted this one up, swimming around being free. A real hippies game actually so i didn'y play it for too long. It was hyped so much though when it came out but it seems a little dated now. One of Davids games.    Eternal Champions  - I couldnt believe it when i booted this one up. This was a memory heavy fighting game which Sega released in order to rival Street Fighter 2, which was winging it's way to the MD soon anyway. Well the SNES version of ST2Turbo was coming out before so i guess it was doing battle with that too. it was also the first fighting game to make use of the 6 button joypad. Though Lynchy never had one of those so when we played the game at his you had to press the start button to turn your 3 kicks into 3 punches. I made sure I bought a 6 button pad as soon as I bought it all off him. But what a shit game Eternal Champions is, it's just so unplayable. Actually i've just had a peek on Game Faqs to see if anyone agrees with me but it seems to have a page full of glowing reviews so i guess I'll have to say it. All the characters have shit moves, no combos and the one player game is boring as hell, and hard. It's really dated now actually.    Flashback  - YES! now we're talking. FLashback was one of my fave SNES games and I was missing it so much that while I didn't have a SNES i just got it on the ol MD. It's the sequel to Another World but i don't think that it's got anything to do with it. You're this guy Conrad Hart who's lost his memory and has been dumped in this weird jungle area by these aliens so what you have to do is get your emmory back and escape back to earth. I alsways though that Tomb Raider was basically a 3D version of this game, but set in a sort of cyberpunk typed setting rather than the caves and egyptian tombs of that game. In fact Flashback had it's own PSone follow up too Fade to Black which aparently influenced TR as well so there you go. It just brings back lots of SNES memories, especially Christmas 1993 when i got it along with Cool Spot. The idea was to complete the first level but i was a numpty and forgot to pick the injured boy's ID card and couldnt be bothered going back to get it.    Golden Axe II  - A legendary Megadrive game which is a little too dated for me. I get really bored of playing it and...well im embarassed to say but I'm not particularly good at these side scrolling beat em up games for some reason. I'm good at the one on one ones but even though people say that the Golden Axe types are dead easy I can only seem to get myself half way through the game before running out of lives. I think what i need to do is play with a friend all the time. But this is a bit old fo rme this game, i remmeber me and George having a good game of it a few years back and that was good i guess. one of Lynchys.    James Pond 3: Operation Starfish  - I bought this. Cos i like Robocod and I wanted to see what the sequel was like. A bit pish actually, I never worked out what allt he controls were when i bought it though and I was stuck on the first level forever but yesterday i realised that A was run so i manager to get over all the hills and progressed to the secodn level, how boss am i?    Micro machines 2  - It took me a year and a half to get round to buying new Megadrive games for myself, and that was just like 1 week before I got myself a Saturn. So i guess this is (and SF2SCE see below) the most important game in my whole second wave of gaming cos buying it helped me decide that getting back into games was a thing to do. I had a wee bit of fun with it but a second played would have been sound.    Mortal Kombat  - There was no bloody game in the fecking box! Where the hell has Lynchy's copy of MK gome? Actually it's not important because it's shit.    Sonic the Hedghog  - The amount of time's I've played that first level. Over and over. It's ok i will progress one day when i can be bothered to remind myself of the level skip. Actually what I want is to get a hold of all the sequels, or maybe just wait for the Mega Collection for the PS2. Sonic was something of an enigma to me back when it cam eout because I had no access to consoles and this game seemed like a whole new world to me. The first time I played it was at this game show in Glasgow and i had to queue up to play the damn thing. It just looked so polished and hi res that it could never be seen on my Atari ST.    Street Fighter 2 Special Champion Edition  - Teh game i bought with Micro Machines 2. Never really did play it as much as i could have done back in thouse days, i guess I was just screaming out for the SNES version. I had a good look at it this time though and the difference in the quality of graphics compared to the Nintendo version is quite noticable, plus the sound is shit, but it's still the same game. And i didnt have to look up any speed cheat to play the game at its fastest to that was great too.    Streets of rage  - One of Davids games but one of my most favourite MD carts. Even though its a side scrolling fighting game, but it's different to GOlden Axe. Actually i was a level skip for this too, or just to be able to play it with someone so the first few levels arent boring.    Strider  - Wow now this looks so OLD now. Lynchys game.    Taz-Mania  - I think this came out ar around the time the cartoon had started, but i had never seen it so i think it was just on satelite or cable. I used to be really into it but now though the graphics are big and bold it is a bit crap to be honest.     Where in the World and in Time is Carmen Sandiago -  Both are shit. I can only think David got these games because ht wanted to sow that he was a clever lad rather than just someone one who was intersted in blasting bad guys. These games are as boring as fuck.    Wrestle War -  I didnt actually play this one because it's at my sisters, but it's the worst game ever   So there yo uhave it, that's the story of my Megadrive which still feels like it's david's so I guess I'm gonna have to get on Ebay there and flog some of his terrible games then.
