I guess it will be a record of the summer etc. and what i do for my running career.  I would like to begin by saying that I go to a 2AA school Bishop England High School, and that I was on the Varsity Team for both Cross Country and Track.  In cross country my PR is 19:57 and i was no. 7 on my team so obviously i went to state.  In track i ran on the 4x800 team, the mile and sometimes other events but nothing worth mentioning.  Well i will 400 hurdles, the 4x400 sometimes, and the 800 a few times. PR's  5000-19:57, 1600-5:20, 800-2:16(WOW...sike) no. 2 on the 4x800 team at lower state, 400-60.76 (4x400 split) and 400H-66 or 67 i dont rememeber.  As i said the boys XC team made it to state and came in 12th and the 4x800 team made it to lower state and came in fifth and failed to qualify by one place. I invite everyone to join and read as it will be an educational experience.  Today I ran 2.3 miles in 17 minutes wow that is really horrible but i havent run in 2.5 weeks. During those 2.5 weeks after failing to qualify for state, i have been lifting weights in an attempt to look buff and considering the weight has been going up, my body isnt really the type that looks buff.  Ill try anyway.  Anyways parkers coming over so check back later. Peace.
