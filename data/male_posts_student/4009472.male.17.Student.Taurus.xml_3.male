When I was younger I explored my interest in fossils and the remains of extinct civilizations, and much of my exploration defined my later interests in life. Gradually through fossils I became interested in anthropology, and I am now very intrigued by recent history, the Enlightenment and French Revolution periods especially.    As a history fanatic, I have come to realize that in many cases it tends to repeat itself over the course of generations -- I haven't seen much evidence of humans being able to learn from their own mistakes. With that in mind, I made a very disheartening discovery today as I mused on the state of various class systems throughout history. I began to compare our own current 'unofficial' class system in the United States with that of other countries worldwide, and I noticed that it is very similar to that of the French Government around 1789.    The Three Estate System, as it was called, consisted of three different classes; the Clergy, the Nobles, and the Lower Class 'Third Estate'. The Nobles and the Clergy controlled all of the political power in the country, and the Third Estate was heavily taxed despite its economic state. The Third Estate was further divided into three groups; the Bourgeoisie, the Workers, and the Peasants. The bourgeosie were made up of Artisans, Merchants, and Skilled Workers. Despite some being as wealthy as the Nobles, they were afforded no political rights. Well educated, they believed strongly in the ideas of the Enlightenment, and brought concepts of liberty and equality to the other parts of the Third Estate. Many were disenfranchised with the Old Regime in France, and believed that their wealth entitled them to greater political and social power within the government. It was members of this group who initially made the push for revolution during the Meeting of the Estates General.  The second class within the Third Estate I call the 'Urban Worker' class. Urban Workers generally consisted of cooks and servants, and were poorer than the bourgeoisie. Often out of work, these workers suffered extremely low wages when they did find jobs. As a result, when the cost of bread rose, mobs often formed and attacked carts of grain and bread to steal what they needed. They lacked any political power, and could not hope to graduate in class as they were often only poorly educated.  The lowest class within the Third Estate was the Peasant class. This class, made up of more than eighty percent of France's twenty-six million people, began to resent the nobles and the clergy. Having no political rights and very little education, peasants were unable to more beyond their class and often were the victims of famine and disease outbreaks due to poor sanitation. Despite making nearly nothing, peasants were heavily taxed on everything from grain to salt. Frustrated with their position, they began to look toward the government for change.    The United States, despite not having an 'official' class system is very much divided economically. Based on Wealth, Occupation, and political access, these classes resemble in many ways the Three Estate system of pre-revolution France. Our own class system is split up into five major categories; a firmly established Upper Class, an Upper-Middle Class, a rapidly decreasing middle class, a lower middle class, and a lower class.    The ingrained upper class consists of those who -- either through luck or through birth (or in some rare cases, skill) -- have come upon extreme wealth and been accepted into the upper-crust of wealthy society. Members of this class often maintain their wealth through social and political connections by obtaining coveted high-salary jobs within corporations. It is not uncommon for this status to be transmitted to the progeny of a member, and often they rely on each other to maintain their fortunes and power over generations. This class makes up a small fraction of the wealthiest 2% of Americans.    The next class is the Upper Middle class of professional workers. Despite being allowed access to the best educational institutions and wealth of the upper class, members of the upper middle class are rarely afforded the social advantages and corporate jobs given to the upper class. Generally, the middle class consists of educated workers such as Doctors or Architects, and can make anywhere between forty-thousand and two-hundred thousand dollars a year.    The unionized middle class, skilled only in one particular vocation, has long been thought to be disappearing. Corporate downsizing and other such events have forced many members of the middle class to pursue higher education and become members of the upper-middle class, and forced others into the lower class of basic service jobs.    The lower-middle 'working poor' obtain unskilled positions at service establishments such as Fast Food restaurants or Gas Stations. Plagued by varied hours and low pay, members of this class often experience repellent working conditions. Despite being materially wealthy on a worldwide standard, these workers have become marginalized members of American society.    The Lower class consists of impoverished and often-desperate individuals. Crime and hunger threaten them on a daily basis, and their conditions often make pursuing higher education impossible. Despite being the largest sector of Americans, they are the most marginalized in American society.    I believe that if looked at in terms of capitol, the French 'Old Regime' is very similar to America today. The upper two-percent of Americans control ninety-percent of the wealth in the country, and our most recent tax reform was a cut for the rich. The entrenched upper class has in general far more wealth than a member of the upper-middle class would reasonably conceive of attaining. Like the bourgeoisie, the upper-middle class lacks the political and social benefits of being a 'noble' member of the upper class. Meanwhile, anti-wealthy and socialist sentiments grow within the increasingly more impoverished middle and lower classes. Looking at all of this, and keeping in mind that the eve of the most divisive election in recent history rapidly approaches I cannot help but fear that perhaps revolution is brewing in America, and has been for quite some time.
