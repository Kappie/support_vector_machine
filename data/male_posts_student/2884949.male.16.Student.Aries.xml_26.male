Crazy, eh? Oh well, such is life.   Today, I think I bombed 2 of my finals, so that sucks. Hahaha. I hope I dont fail. But if I do, oh fucking well. I guess it'll suck to be me for awhile. Anyhow. Onto better news. Im listening to Smile Empty Soul. They are pretty good, which is awesome. Hahaha. Yeah. I dont know what else to say in here. My one ear is hurting hahahaha. Oh well. That's ok though, I think.  Anyhow, Im outta here.  Later  Jerry
