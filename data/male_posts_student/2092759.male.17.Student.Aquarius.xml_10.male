God decided to listen when I asked for a girlfriend, for someone who makes me feel good about myself and good about the world. Im not gonna go all religious and everything, but i would just like to firmly state my position, and there is a God. So, on that note: This is to Sabina.    Earth Angel  By: Jesse Belvin and Curtis Williamson  Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine? My darling dear, love you all the time. I'm just a fool, a fool in love, with you.  Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, Love you forever, and ever more. I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.  I fell for you, and I knew, The vision of your love, loveliness. I hope and I pray, that some day, I'll be the vision of your hap hapiness Oh  Earth angel earth angel, please be mine, My darling dear, love you all the time, I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you  I fell for you, and I knew, The vision of your lovliness. I hope and I pray, that someday, That I'll be the vision of your happiness.  Earth angel earth angel, please be mine, My darling dear, love you all the time, I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you  So, now to fill everybosy who might feel out of the loop in. I met this freshman girl named Sabina a little while before Christmas timeish. Shes was really funny, a blast to hang around with, and just a great person. We went on a date, but her stepdad didnt like the concept of her dating someone older then her. Flashforward to about two weeks ago. Sabinas mother and step-father are getting a divorce. We started talking a little bit more and became increasingly envolved. She asked me to Sadie Hawkins, just as friends. We sort of beat around the bush for a while, and some things happened between her and some friends of hers that im not going to talk about, but the long and short of it is we are dateing now. Now that I have been granted by deepest wish: I have a girlfriend and I am sooooooooooooo happy its not even funny.
