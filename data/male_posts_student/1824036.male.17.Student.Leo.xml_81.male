Megan (a girl that is near perfect in the eyes of many...but I am always mean to her) has brought up some very good points. I need to have a serious talk with Jadie. I dont konw what is going to happen between us...but it might be something that she will finally get,  that love is a two way street . And that one persons values (like a simple thank you) are important.  Too much shi....crap on my mind today.  Once again thank you Megan!
