This blogger site will do for me for the present.   So, news from Dave. Firstly, with my oldest sister Caron buggering off to Majorca for a holiday with some of her friends, and my parents going off somewhere for a few days, and my other sister working at Buckingham Palace (only selling tickets, nothing exciting) I get most of the day home alone. W00t! But I doubt it will be any different from any other days.   Well, yesterday was slightly different, in that I cooked for me and Tracy cauliflower cheese, a recipe for which I found on the Internet. Now, even though this is a great technological age, I don’t have a digital camera, so no pictures will be appearing on the blog, unlike  urlLink dickybod , who got pics of his cooking. You’ll just have to trust me; it turned out very nice. :)   So, what else, what else…? I’ve been trying to make today more productive than normal, and so I spent a while longer learning Esperanto (an incredibly sad thing to do), and I’m progressing quite well with it. If I’m very lucky by the end of Summer I should be able to speak it pretty well.  And finally, I watched 'Aliens', which I videoed from last night (twas on a bit late for me). A rather good film methinks. That’s about all for now, ta ta   Weather:  Cloudy  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Combine Harvester Techno remix :)  Watching:  Aliens  Confused about:  Pronounciation of strange Esperanto letters  Annoyed with:  Nowt  Mood:  Fine
