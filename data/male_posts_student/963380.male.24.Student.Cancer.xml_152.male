In any case I just happened to walk in on a discussion between this fellow (a hip hopper: the term is derived from his inability to form a complete sentence without some sort of slang or ebonics - not to say this is a bad thing, I find it entertaining as hell) talking to a young lady I work with about, and I quote here, "the sexiest part on a man's body", which to this point I had always assumed would be his quick wit and intellect. Instead I've been informed that the sexiest part on a man's body is in fact, manlines.   Manlines? Say it slowly with me.... W... T....F?  Manlines, apparently, are the vertical lines formed by a man's pelvis if he's pretty trim. Accord to mein hiphopping caucasian manager, this is why hip hoppers wear their pants so low. And here I was thinking it was simply because they hadn't stolen a belt in the right size. (badum bum)  Goooo Manlines.  So I've been on this Atkins diet. About two weeks ago I weighed around 165. I now weigh 153. I'm not really concerned about the weight at all, I couldn't give a toss what I weight. I'm more concerned about my body shape and my energy level - lately my pants feel roomier and I've been doing three miles a day on the treadmill. It's quite rewarding. After my little treadmill sessions I'm also doing a bit of weight training; gonna see if I actually can string some muscle on these bones.
