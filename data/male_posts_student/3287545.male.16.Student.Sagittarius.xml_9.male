I’ve already managed to find and erase 3 in the last few days, maybe this one will find some more. I phoned Katie earlier, which was technically yesterday, I had to tell her she can come over on Thursday. My mum is insistant on me inviting her over because I always go to hers. I really don’t want her to come, it’s going to be so so boring, I know it will. That should be the last time I see her before we become ex’s. I still want to go ahead with the leter posting, but speaking to her today only makes me feel guilty about writing a letter expressing my guilt! But is has to be done. I can’t go on any longer with this, it really is tearing me apart. I hate going out with her so much. I was looking in the kays catalogue earlier as well, just looking at suits for the prom, although, I don’t intend to have a girlfriend when I go to it. I like the Nehru style, which a kind of professional Indian influenced style, in black and pinstripe.
