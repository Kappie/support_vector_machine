I am not THAT much of a kultz anymore. Meow!!  Okay. The exciting thing happened duiring History. Now THAT exciting if you come to think about it. First, we found out that LiangSiang/LiPeng got 93 overall for Combined Humanities. Me and CQ realised that there;s no way of winning them liao. Sigh!! Okay. I was utterly shcoked you know. I got....35 for History! Just  barely got an A2. I am not happy lor. My source-based got 14...luckily my structured essay saved moi! But!! But!! Overall, I got 80! YaY!!! I am so glad I improved! And CQ got an A1! Good for him! YaY!!!    CQ and I decided to pull a little trick on those friends of mine ar. You see ar. They would rather much prefer I get a low mark for History (very evil leh!).So, even if I tell them I got A1 for my Humane, I will be treated indifferently. So, I suggested that CQ tell them I got 29, missing my A1 by 1 mark. I know they will most readily believe that anyway.  So, when returning to class, I tried to act as angry and as sad as possible. I shouted at SH and put that chou nian. Acutally hor, I was trying SO hard not to laugh you know. Woah! YH and WQ was so happy. So evil!! I see their true colours liao ar! I couldn't take it anymore. I ran to Wendy and started laughing and laughing and telling her what I was doing. HaHaHa! In order to keep up with my crankiness, I told WQ "What la! worry about EL? Sure fail one la you! I cna't even get an A1 for Humane, you surely won't pass EL one!". Being as revengeful as always, he started insulting me to CQ (must accept the truth ma! :P). CQ, who cannot stand the nagging and the backstabbing, decided to tell them the truth. Ai-yer. Not fun one (No la where got, CQ hor?). Meow meow!  Hm. Ayiah. Nothing much went on la. I got no mood to write now, due to me exchaging sarcasm with the  SUPER, BEGIGN, BENEVOLENT, ALL-POWERFUL GOD-LIKE  class administrator. Hm. If you can't comprehend what the italics tell you, you can always ask me for explanations. So, see ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.
