Especially when those "Love Triangles" among friends appear, just like Keith, Shannon, and I. I got to thinking, I'm only 16 freaking years old. I don't want to hurt anybody else or lose friends such as Keith. I'm not saying I don't care for Shannon anymore, oh I do! To much to endure! I would do anything for her. She needs to stop being so self-conscious. All girls do honestly. Shannon is so inherently beautiful. Even in her "Bad Years" I find her just so adorable. We are just friends, and If she ever has those feelings for me again, she needs to tell me. Yes, everyone will say get over her. I am! In a way. But, I'm telling you I will never stop loving her.
