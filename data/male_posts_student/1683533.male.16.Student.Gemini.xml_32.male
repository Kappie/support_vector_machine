False, for me it is anyways....I am not sayin I want a whore, but a girl with some experience would be nice...cause then they wont be all nervous...  2.  Guys want girls so be like their mom . False, I want you to love me and nuture me like a mother, but moms are fuckin' naggy and annoying...and dont have much in common interest wise....don't be like mom's like that......  3.  Guys like girls with humongous boobs . In my opinion...false...ugh...big boobs like the size of fucking watermelons...turn me off...too big...I just like a handful...It all has to do with proportion for me...like a proportional girl...  i can't think of anything else....i am reading this over and it seems pretty stupid...oh well...
