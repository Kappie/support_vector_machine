I was on my way home from school one evening, i took the normal journey. Which was the train from Chua Chu Kang MRT station. The train was not as crowded as it would have been during the peak hours. There were vacant seats and lots of standing room on the train. But there was this group of people who chose to sit on the floor instead! The sat in a circle in the middle of the cabin. Just then it hit me like a ton of bricks(or earth for this matter), it was the AGM of the 土地公s(Tu Di Gongs, Earth Deities)! They got high tech and decided to take the train instead of digging in the ground to get to their distinations. Apparently, all of them were already on the train except for the 土地公s(Tu Di Gongs, Earth Deities) incharge of the the east regions. Either they were early, or the held on to their traditional diggin beliefs. So i walked over to see if i could get any information from their conversation. Then came this tall, dark(soil covered man), he said:" U can catch this on www.GuanYingMa.com.sg, please do not proceed further lest u disturb them in their important congregation. man, these idiots are very IT-savy huh.. haha.. of course this is all just make belief. No actual 土地公 (Tu Di Gong, Earth Deities ) was sighted or any congregation took place on the public transport,SMRT. I just got kinda irritated by these idiots who likes to block the way of other passengers by sitting on the floor. maybe in their villages, its a kind of culture or it could be due to the fact tt they have never seen an actual seat in their lives and hence, do not know the way to sit on one..
