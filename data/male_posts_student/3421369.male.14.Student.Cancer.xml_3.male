Am i wrong?? Why is she not giving me hints that im wrong?? Why?? Wat did i do to her?? Nvr mind.. i will continue to count the days..    In the morning.. woke up.. Felt that not feeling very well.. But then still went to school.. Stagger and swagger as i walked to school.. My throat was still extreme painful..    Reached school.. Assembly.. Then went to class.. Then realised that it was history and not chinese.. Arh!!! But.. since i always put books under desk.. it doesnt matter much.. lol..    Science lessons.. then recess.. Then 2 periods of Sims lesson.. So damn boring.. Practically learned nothing at all.. Finally.. its CHOA lesson.. Literature!! Glad that today she not that bad... Didn scold us..
