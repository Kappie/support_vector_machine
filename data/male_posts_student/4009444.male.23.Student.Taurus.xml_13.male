I had an hour to kill before the AAUS class was to meet, but as Murphy's Law predicted, PW was closed.  So I drove to Point Fermin where we were to meet, and I just flipped through the atlas.  I found myself looking at the two pages of North Carolina maps, remembering my time there fondly.  Who knows - maybe I'll be back there someday.  "Time passes, people move. Like a river's flow, it never ends.  A childish mind will turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear water's surface reflects growth." - believe it or not, from Zelda: Ocarina of Time  "My god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return But now here you are, and here I am..." - Pearl Jam - Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town  "Thas only in tha mo'nin'.  You sposed to be up cookin' breakfast fo' somebody." - Bubb Rubb
