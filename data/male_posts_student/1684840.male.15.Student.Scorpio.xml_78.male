Dido's new album is out *woohoo*  Now I've got some more music to listen to at last, which makes a nice difference from Avril etc. (Ironic really as I haven't yet even got the new Dido album!)  The day Mrs. Checketts realises that there are more words in the vocabulary other than really difficult ones will be the day man lands on the sun.  She almost stood there for 20 minutes asking around what abstract meant *rolls eyes*  I'm planning on making a Snapshot space on the main site for webcam pics.  That is when I've got a web cam of course; I'm saving up for one :D  Night :)
