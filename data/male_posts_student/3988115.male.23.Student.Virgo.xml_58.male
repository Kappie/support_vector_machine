She then took this TexShare card out of town to a different library that is also on the TexShare system. That library took one look at the card and commented, "oh Irving will give a card to  anyone , even someone from Ohio..." and basically told her that they wouldn't issue her a card since they knew that Irving's policies were so open. Naturally I was unhappy since they offended my friend, my library, and my dignity...so here is what I did:  1.) I discussed this with Logan, who also agreed it was a travesty of everything right in this world, and I then emailed my story/complaint to him which I will forward to the Assistant Director tomorrow.  2.) I emailed the Texas Library Association and reported that a certain small-town library feels they have the right to be selective on TexShare cards they honor based on their interpretation of the other library's policies. We'll see what comes of that.  3.)I emailed the offending party a certain link that starts with  urlLink www.tub ... oh wait, this has gone too far already...
