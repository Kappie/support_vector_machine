Anyway, it's like how to say leh... i was really upset to see the 28th Council leave, but, as well as happy for the breathe of fresh air coming from the swearing in of he 29th Council! When i 1st realise that the 28th was leaving, i guess i teared, but thank gosh no 1 saw that! whereas, when i saw Li Feng being sworn in as President, i was sure that it was a brand new era and that everything would be great and exciting things were forthcoming!  However, i was really upset when my friends were bad mouthing Li Feng, she really is a wonderful girl and man, i think she is really swell and would work out to be a great president! Alas, this batch of friends were like saying that she was really bitchy and detached from us, and well, i was really pissed to hear that lah! It's like, they don't even know her personally! So how could they say such things? Ok, understandably that people say that her speech was very sophisicated and was not very, erm... Homely... but i certainly found it fine! Considering that she talks like this all the time! So yeah, please lah guys, give her some time, she is after all new and you should understand that she is undertaking a huge responsibility and has a lot to live up to!  Anyway, no matter what, she has my support and i pray that the LORD would be there for her and just simply bless her with wisdom! Oh well... Anyway, i just realised that i am doing things that i shouldn't be doing under normal circumstances for Chinese Orchestra! Things such as, for this upcoming Wednesday, i am undertaking the duties that Sujuan should be doing, and that is off... Presenting the Chinese Orchestra and their various instruments for Racial Harmony day! Yup! Another speech and another presentation! Damn it! Haha... not that i am complaining but rather, i am really nervous lah! I am doing it in front of the SC combination lah! wah lau! so pai seh! haha... in front of so many friends! and... well... it'll be the 1st time, that people would see Kelly on stage with me too! Man... i am sure going to get alot of things for this soon! Things, as in... Rumours and gossips... haiz...  Oh! Kelly's birthday is coming up... and well... i can't believe it but i kept forgetting what i've been wanting to get her! Argh! Anyway, i kind of asked Christopher to get it for me lah, told him the whole description and where to get it cause i couldn't get the time considering that i've been bogged down by sickness, family events, and well... work... and... it doesn't help considering that my mom hasn't been really encouraging about me coming home late every day with my sickness! Argh! Anyway, there are some more things that i am preparing for her... so... heex... hope it works out lah...  Haha... ok... Anyway, damn shit lah! i haven't been studying so i am like way back in my reading for GP! i am on page 15/45! Super fast right?! haha... oh well... i better get back to it soon... okok... Anyway, i hope that everything goes well... and i really pray that GOD would bless the new 29th Council and give me strength to do my work well! Just a verse that i got today, something to show that God is always there for us! ;p  Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.  Psalm 139:7-8
