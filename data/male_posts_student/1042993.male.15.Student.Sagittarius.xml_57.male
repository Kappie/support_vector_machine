       
      Friday (5/21 - which is also Call For Help's last day) is our last day for real review, and Monday (5/24) is the last day before our first two exams.  I took the Poetry Exam for English this morning, and the Vocab Exam will be tomorrow (which will contain 280 vocab words and definitions).  So far in review, I believe the hardest exam is going to be Spanish.  Sooooo many conjugations and vocab words.  We have over 20 conjugations to do in present  past tenses and almost 300 Spanish vocab words.  So to all that read this blog, check me off as I go ;-) ...  Tuesday (English  Econ),  Wednesday (Science  Algebra),  Thursday (Spanish  Bible).  In the meanwhile, I need to go finish studying for my vocab exam for English and finish my problems review sheet for Physical Science...  Talk more as May 28th approaches closer and closer!
