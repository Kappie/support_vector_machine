Formed a band with Paul Cozzolino and Steve Giampetro called The Natives. Yesterday I went to my grandma's with my cousin Kate and we had her specialty dinner...IRISH SPAGHETTI! or as I at first called it, meatball chicken! Ok...uh...ya we played Wheel of Fortune and we finally went there, we've planned this since forever basically. Well beginning of school but it never worked out because I babysit now for money...gay job. But now it finally worked out hurray. Ok that's all...except...Heaton got a bunny also and named it Churchill and I hate school! Ok, right now I'm updating this update with more stuff...it's 9:35 PM now and I just wanted to say I drummed for 4 1/2 hours like crazy, the end I flipped out on the drums thinking of all the poor momma mice that seperate from their babies that are fed to snakes...and thinking of that...I SMASHED THE DRUMS LIKE I NEVER SMASHED!!! Oh, Dan started up his life again...that's great to hear, it's great to see friends recovering from the Great Depression. Ok, I'm sounding retarded right now so cy'all later.
