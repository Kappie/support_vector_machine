That means that I get at school at 830 and I wait until about 945 until CAD starts, so I can continue playing games, though on another computer in another room. You may be noticing that I cannot spell the word necessary correctly, as Ben has pointed out many times. The problem is, I cannot spell long words for shit and I don't care if you tell me, got it Ben? Good. Another idiot is near me. This seems to be a pattern...thenever I go into the CAD room, an idiot comes to meet me. Hmmm.... Jimmy the Fish is next to me ranting...this reminds me of the Ranting Swede from the show  Sheep in the Big City  from the Cartoon Network. Silly Jimmy... Seth is next to me on his laptop, which I was just playing Unreal Tournament 2003 (if you haven't heard of it, the site is  urlLink here ) on (and pwning, just so you know). But, since it was Seth's computer, I let someone else have a chance to get pwned (this is where the moron comes in). Anyways...I'm out.  --Clash
