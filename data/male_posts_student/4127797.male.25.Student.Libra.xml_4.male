You can visit my website,  urlLink Gilbert Martinez  (threw that in to bump me up on Google), for more personal info and to get an idea what I'll most likely be posting about.  If you're too lazy to go to my  urlLink website , you can expect posts on my science interests, political interests, and general philosophical rantings.  I'll post sometime soon on my impressions from the recent Democratic National Convention.
