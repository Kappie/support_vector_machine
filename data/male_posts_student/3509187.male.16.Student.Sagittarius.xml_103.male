If you haven't seen it, go rent it and watch it ASAP... It all just fit together.  The acting, the storie, the soundtrac, just everything.  Its almost in a small way like Stir of Echoes which is another good movie. And it reminded me of Memento and Vanilla Sky.  Wow... Very odd movie.  The most beautiful work combination: CellarDoor...  -Dan V
