Oh but yes I did talk to Pam, Tracey, and Danny/Kristina on the phone for 3 hours, but thats about it. Uhh yeah since there isn't really a song to describe how bored I am...I'll just put a Greenday song. ...How about Good Riddence (Time of your Life)?    Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.  Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.  So make the best of this test, and don't ask why.  It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life.   So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind.  Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.  Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.  For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.
