It's been a long month i imagine. but i am now back at home. i guess my camp went down pretty well. we were up in temagami for 2 weeks and because sam goes friggin hardcore on trips like that i wore the same clothes for the entire time...yeah those clothes smell like "rotted spiced sausage" no joking...so bad...so smell. I think the only problem that i might have had the entire time would be with some of the guys. one of them alex...was a huge dick...he skipped a grade a while back so he's going into grade 12. and from this he got to be one of the most cockiest assholes i have ever seen. we'll be sitting around reading national geographics from the 80's (which i got addicted to)and he'll be like "hey sam, let's fight!" and he is some tiny little shit who thinks that his muscle was brought on by working out..but it wasn't..it's just him being small....grr i wanted to beat him senseless but i restrained myself...i feel myself to be a passifist. fighting doesn't really help you much anyways. then there was a kid from the U.S...miami actually. and he's always full of shit...i mean everything he said had to be bigger or better than what ever you just said. every body knew he was full of crap. but just him thinking that we were stupid enough to believe him, just makes me p.o'd.  Now i can imagine that you saying "Hey sam, that's not bad" you don't know crap! they pissed me off soo much. and i just about died through the month...but the thought of coming home kept me hanging in there.  and yes it's true this entire month i missed emily madly...and i read her blog as soon as i came back and it seemed like she was getting along pretty well...except for some other stuff. which was really depressing for me to hear that was going on while i was away. i juts hope that it works out for her...ooo ooo she and chelsea get back home tomorrow...and if i had it my way i would be there waiting for her at her house when she got there but i'm pretty sure that that is not possible. meh i can't wait to talk to her again though. i'm really anxious to see her and spend the rest of the summer together...yay yay yay fun! anyways yeah i'm back...month's gone by...see you guys soon. Sam
