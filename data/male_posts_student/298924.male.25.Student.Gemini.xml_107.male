I'm also going to install this hard drive that has been sitting on my living room table for a month along with 256 of ram....  I'm going to wash all of these clothes in my room....  I'm going to upload this Ceelo album for OJ....  I'm going to wash these dishes....  I'm going to write a letter to my dad and my Uncle Steve....  I'm gonna find my cousin Bryan and demand my money.....  I'm going to make the move on one of these availabe females up here.....  I'm going to finish all of these books I started.....  I'm going to watch these new movies I have yet to watch....  I'm going to actually study hard....  I'm going to call everyone in my palm pilot....  I'm going to get back in touch with Christal and Elenda....  I'm going to kick it more with my boys Rashard, Nile, and John....
