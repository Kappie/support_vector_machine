Now normally I wouldn't be this excited except that it’s a long weekend and today was the last day! Yay.  Tomorrow I’m going to work with my dad, a little extra money never hurt.  Mr. Allen from Allen's Jewelers came today, designed our class rings, and came home to find out that he screwed up mine.  He didn't put down anything about the stone, so need to get that fixed, and I swear that he will mess up the Latin because the C in cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) looks like a g and all of his g's look like q's.  They already messed up my mom's diamond ring, so I’m pretty skeptical.  My ring size is about 11 and a half, about the size of my dad's hand.     I wish I could take Latin, but Copenhagen doesn't offer any Latin courses on distance learning or anything.  I also want to find some advanced mathematics and physics courses online also... free if possible, I just want to get a feel for them before I go.  I really want to go for computer technology, maybe some robotics, mathematics, physics, astronomy, physiology, biology, and some chemistry thrown in also.  But really, I will never be able to do all of it so I’ll have to cut it back to something less.  I'm going to have to fight for tuition and scholarships next year, my class may look dumb but there pretty tough, tougher than many of the past grades.     I forgot to eat today.  I didn't have time for breakfast, missed lunch for my class ring order, and skipped the leftover surprise for supper tonight.  I didn't miss it that much, since I already gained 30 pounds from last summer.  This summer I am so intent at using the treadmill it's not funny.  Well anyway *eep* I better *eep* go back *eep* to *eep* sleeping *eep eep eep*  BE Gone with you vile EEPS!! *meep!* ... Great... LATER all! :)  ~peace
