She's a good friend and a caring one, she's tryin so hard just to get by. And then I went backpacking at oak openings, and i am glad to know my pack is working great.  Then at 6:00 i went with Heather and her friends Danniele, Maria, and Mike to their youth service at Bethal. At first i was uncomfortable, but then it hit me. The solution to my unhappieness was to live for God. I needed to reach out and help people to find Him, and like Allie told me the night before, you have the friends, just make them christian.(but she said it in her own way) Then i was reading one of these blog things, and the guy made a good point and told me to find something to do, so i started my own. So that's about it, I'm gonna look for some things for chaplaining at Philmont.
