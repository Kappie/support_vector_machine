The movie wasn't like the best of all time but it sure is an important film and pretty good, one of those deep character movies from the '60's which are so good. Plus, Paul Newman is a fantastic actor. Particularly, and this has happened in other movies, most notably in my mind "Of Mice and Men," where a montage of shots of a main character smiling, laughing, etc., is done at the end, and I find that very powerful in Cool Hand Luke in the ending and the aforementioned film, and I'm going to try and incorporate that into my screenplays because I find it very effective in evoking emotion and care for a character who has suffered some unfortunate end.  Here's the link to listen to a clip from the soundtrack, try tracks 1, 10, 12, and 18, it may be an acquired taste, but I find the music to be very enjoyable.
