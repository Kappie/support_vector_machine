I got this email from Amanda from school who got it from her grandma:   Subject: Kerry enterprises  Shortly after reading the following e-mail content, I happened to look at the label of a jar of Heinz sandwich slice pickles. Yep...."Made in Mexico" Check some of your Heinz products.  "Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S. corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened. However, he is trying to blame it on George W. Bush.  As far as I know, Bush has not moved one factory out of this country because he is not the owner of a single factory.  That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Kerrey’s own 32 factories in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company, leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia. Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean.  I wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated in foreign countries. I also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States.  Of course they're not. However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner?  If Kerry is elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America? Of course they won't. They're making millions off that cheap labor.   So, doing the Democratic thing I do, and started to prove this email wrong. I started by going to Yahoo! Finance and looking up the Heinz stock stuff. Then I clicked on Major Holders. After pulling up this webpage I shocking found the Teresa Heinz-Kerry is NOT a major holder. Here is what I found:    JOHNSON, WILLIAM R. holds 550,086 shares as reported on 22-Sep-03 JOHNSON, WILLIAM R. holds 342,639 shares as reported on 20-Jun-03 BERTASSO, MICHAEL J. holds 97,817 shares as reported on 22-Sep-03 JIMENEZ, JOSEPH holds 74,951 shares as reported on 19-Mar-04 MILONE, MICHAEL D. holds 66,603 shares as reported on 20-Jan-04    Thus proving that Teresa Heinz-Kerry doesn’t own a majority of the company, I then went to the Heinz Company’s website, and pulling up the About Us page, I found that William R Johnson, who owns 550,086 shares of stock, is the Chairmen, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Heinz Corporation. This proves that Teresa Heinz-Kerry doesn’t run the day to day, or even the company in general.   Ahh. I’m happy! LOL.
