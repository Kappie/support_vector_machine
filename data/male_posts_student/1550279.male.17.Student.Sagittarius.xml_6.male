No clue where that is (except that it's somewhere in Texas), but apparently it takes a while to get there. From what I've heard, the games will either be here, Kilgore, Tyler, or some combination of those places. Coach Gibbins said that he'd call me this next week and let me know the times and places of the games (hopefully the times for the bus, also). If we keep advancing, the State Finals are the 10th and 11th of June.  Apparently putting eye black on me is now good luck for the team. Before the game, someone pointed out that they won the last game they put it on me, and now they're 2/2. It doesn't really bother me -- I just have to remember not to wipe my face.  This might be the last week that I'm able to work the playoff games since I start summer school 1 week from Tuesday. I didn't want to have to take Speech next year, so my only other option was to take it during the summer. 3 weeks vs. 18 weeks?? I think I'll take the 3...
