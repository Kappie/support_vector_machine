ME: Yeah WOMAN: What color were you thinking? ME: Ultra Lemon WOMAN: Yes, that's a nice color.  A litle acidic, though. ME: Oh. WOMAN: I was looking at your flyer.  I think Sun Yellow might be better.  You see, I'm a painter, and I know about colors and these things.  Sun Yellow is a very warm color.  Is your singing group co-ed? ME: Yeah. WOMAN: Yeah, Sun Yellow is a very androgynous color too.  I think you should go with Sun Yellow.  I used Sun Yellow.  The flyers look very nice.
