Unfortunately, their cadavers absorbed liquid nitrogen reacting with plutonium. So they roamed the fucking room.              Part 2.  Anthropology. So there was this project. It was like a magazine. Logically, every magazine has its editor. I being the genius that I am, was appointed one of the five editors.        The class was divided into five, for the five magazines.         For the meantime, there was peace and harmony.  Then, some DIPSHITS changed the freaking groupings. the deal was, rearrangements were approved, provided that the editor approved..         Since I had no fucking idea what the hell was happening, it means that I did not approve.  I complained, got angry, cursed, destroyed a chair, (the usual ranting) tapos, ako pa ngayon ang masama. Eh mga gago pala kayo eh! Kahit na binigay nyo saken mga bobong mga ka-group i don't GIVE A FLYING FUCK! Just ask for my consent Dipshits!! is that too hard to understand!!        Dipshit is the theme for this blog, so leave now if you don't want profanity, because there's more to come.         There's gonna be some serious ass-kicking.         (insert part 3 here)
