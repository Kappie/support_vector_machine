As soon as I left the house this morning I started snivelling in the ice cold winds.  It was absolutely freezing!!  I swear I've got a cold coming now, and all thanks to school, the infamous HELL HOLE!  French was a breeze (no pun intended), but after that it all went a bit pear-shaped.  We had a fire drill right at the end of English which was uncalled for.  Standing out in the freezing rain is not fun, trust me!  At least we got to go to break early...  Science was as interrupted as ever and Geography was absolutely... hmm let's see... exciting *cough* not!  Now that I have made fun of the first droning half of the day, let's move onto the second *woo hoo*  Sitting in the unit for 50 minutes when no-one is there but the teaching support staff gives you a lot of time to think and clear your head.  I think that was the lesson I enjoyed the most, even though it really wasn't really a proper lesson.  I'd have hated to do games in  that  weather!  I would not have been amused! *Sips tea like The Queen*  Days go fuzzy as soon as you get home because I try and cram everything fun in as I can, plus do homework at the same time!  Mental I'm telling you...
