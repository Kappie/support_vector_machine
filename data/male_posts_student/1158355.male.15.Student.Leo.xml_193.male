OH MY GAWD, 136 days left until the RUSH CONCERT!!! Seriously, that's all I'm looking forward to, well that and a few other things...turning 16 (sex?) and driving will be nice. And uh having the freedom, and riding my new bike, but I'm already doing that on the nice Spring days. Ah and hopefully getting a job at THE GAME. Oh girl yes. Friday I hung out with Schreck, Kaiser, Heaton and Chris at night and we went to hang out with Carolyn and her friends, my next door neighbor. Weird...Saturday, I went to Joe Zerbo's with Justin (the singer) to see Captive Honor. Man was Joe's set awesome. When I get a job mines gonna be awesome like his. At night I went to the movies with Keith and his girlfriend Heather and her friend Alyssa. It was fun, we saw Walking Tall. It was a great movie but it was too short, not even an hour and a half. The Rock is the man. Anyways, after that we walked tall around the area and went to McDonald's where we played with quarters to make our knuckles bleed and I kept throwing fries dipped in melted ice cream at the girls. It was fun once again. Then when Keith brought me back home I did that thing, with the bed. Well first I did a dance. Today, Dan and I had a practice with his new amp and we made a new kick ass song. It's really good so far. My grandma came over for dinner just before. I didn't get to practice drums this weekend really, I was busy hanging out with all the people I hadn't hung out with in a while. So this weekend really kicked some tail. Just 10 minutes ago, while finding the secret on Homestar.com of homestar puppet playing tennis and listening to their old christmas everybody song, I was touched. And it makes me wanna write about the great things in life. About how great it feels in the Winter. Christmas time. And having fun in the summer, with freedom. Life is awesome. For all you people that are depressed out of their mind, cheer up...wait my last post I was a pecemist and now I'm all optomistic. I enjoy being optomistic. This world kicks ass. At least Smithtown does. I love my drums. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my life I love titties. Haha, it's funny because I said I love my drums...what was I thinking, I love titties belongs first. And man booz as well. The End.
