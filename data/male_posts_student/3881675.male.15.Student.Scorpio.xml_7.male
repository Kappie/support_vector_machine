Then my phone rings and i answer. jonny talks on the other line and he says he needs to ask me a question. i say go ahead and he asked my opinion on how possible it would be for two 15 year olds (like us) to get a number one single in the UK managing a pop act. so i answer very possible and leave it at that since jonny's always full of bizarre questions. he then goes on and explains his whole plan on how he's going to find a pop act and get them to number one in the charts. now u gotta understand that at this point i'm completely lost and he's the only one left talking. after he's hammered some of his ideas into my head, he asks if i'm in. as always, i'm not too reluctant on this as i have no idea how far he was going to take it so i say to him that whatever he does, i'll be with him all the way.  After we cleared that, i ask him about how the hell he was going to find a pop act to take to number one and he carefully explains to me his theories and hypothesis'. He tells me that most successful pop acts are male (well guys our age at least) because all the gals go out and buy their CD's and go along to their concerts and scream etc... Then he says that it would be helpful to find someone (male) who was a very popular guy in as many ways as possible inorder to make things easier for us. then he explains how we organise a couple of gigs for this guy and then try and sell some CD's. then offer it to a radio station after he gets a bit more of a reputation. and from then on goes our claim to fame and in comes the cash rolling right into our hands.  Then i say to him quite bluntly: when u find the guy, call me. since i still didn;t know whether he was 100% serious, i couldn;t be asked to put in any effort in getting this thing going. he then sighs and says ok. he says he would draw up a whole list of the stages of his plan and what he intends to do and then we would meet up for lunch and discuss it over a nice cup of coffee. so i say ok and he says he'd call me some time during the week.  i'm kinda looking forward to this meeting and too hear more of his crazy ideas. the funny thing is, he is convinced that the chances of us doing this is very high. i think i might just be believing him...
