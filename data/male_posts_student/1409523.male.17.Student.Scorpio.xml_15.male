I wish (i just went to the matrix) that i could have the same experience everyday... ie.  come out of school and be like WOW i stunned (whether or not for the sheer shock of actually learning or the atmosphere) but i think that is just a little too much to ask... i think if there was a hell... it would be lined with school bathrooms without stall doors... annoying psycho dykes... classes w/ the Brickley... pep assemblies... and all of the assholes that make hhs so unique... wow... i better not go there... it sounds too much like.. i dunno .. REAL LIFE!! aaahhhhh  fuck it.. i have thirteen days of hell left.... and that is one less than yesterday... hmmm i think i am bitching too much.. but sometimes i just cant take .. i put all of this effort and energy into school and i feel like sometimes i just dont get anything back...and while yes i do know that there are many who put less into school that get about the same i do out of it... sometimes i just cant help being an overachiever... i guess i just have high expectations.... i dunno.. fuck it.. im going to bed!
