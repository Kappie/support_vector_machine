The next comic will be posted around 7, or something this morning, so enjoy. It's a short one, but that's okay. All of the early comics vary in length greatly. Once all of the first year's comics have cycled, we'll probably set a standard length.    Eventually I'll be adding a drop-down listing all available comics. Normally I wouldn't add this (cause I'm lazy), but the archive works in strange ways and doesn't list all the comics on any previous comic or, whatever...I'm not sure if you understand, but if you don't, too bad. It's not like it's gunna effect you or anything.    Anyway, good night...err, morning.    - Takkun
