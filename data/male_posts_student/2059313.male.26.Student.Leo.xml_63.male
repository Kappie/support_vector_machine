Even if I was beginning to feel better, there was no way that Mom would've let me go play. "Too sick for school, too sick for play".  That was the one way my Mom kept me from faking being sick... she knew that I might be a little sick, but that I could probably tough it out, and if I did and felt really crappy when I came home, then the next day I wouldn't go to school at all.  My mom had me figured out.  The days I was REALLY sick, I would try to go to school and tell mom I was fine.  If I would try to convince her that I was sick, she would convince me to go to school.  The funny thing is, sometimes she went ahead and let me stay home.  She always seemed to know when I was faking something, but just because I needed a kind of personal day.  It didn't happen all the time.  I must admit, right around the time my father passed away, it happened more often, and later in life, mom asked me, and I told her how much I faked it, and she knew.  I love my mom.  But this story isn't meant to be about her.  It's about being sick, and how much you feel like you miss out when you stay at home.  I have a bunch of friends that I'm really missing right now, because they are all bowling.  I'm not just missing out on the bowling, but the forging ahead of relationships and friendships.  Now I feel doubly miserable.  And what's worse, the internet doesn't work right now (9:29pm) and so I can't even check my e-mail or anything.  I feel so cut-off right now.
