He is poor and unemployed. Money is going to start leaving his account at a great rate of knots in the near future and no-one seems to want to employ him. With this is mind, it would seem that he has only one more option open to him. He is going to grow a beard of some description, start wearing glasses and move to South America to start a new life under the name of Eduardo. With his previous military experience and financial prowess (!) there is little doubt that he will soon end up as either a drug baron or the dictator of a small country. In  order to counter this it is suggested that if you ever meet Hutch you should buy him a drink or, if you are in a position to, offer him a job in a financial institution (he has an MSc Finance and Management by the way). After all, could you live with yourself knowing that you had it in your power to stop a dictator before he gets going? urlLink
