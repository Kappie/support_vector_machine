The blog went from the dull orange monotone look to this brand spanking new look of 9, yes you heard right, NINE colors. The isn't even including black and white which aren't offiicially colors. But thats a lesson to be learned at a later date..or Intro to 2D class. The colors are ( in order they appear on the page and named to their closest Crayola conterpart): Robins Egg blue, Yellow, Salmon, Brick Red, Orange, Forrest Green, Blue, Purple Mountains Majesty, and Lime Green. It's a color overload.   I guess I'll go ahead and put some more stuff in here while i'm at it. I have something to admit. I watched 3 (THREE) college womens basketball games this weekend. No, I am not sick. Actually, I only watched the end of the last two because they were close. But the first one, I watched the last 15 minutes!!! Crazy. And though it was no doubt not as excting as mens b-ball due to their lack of height and overall non-basketball builds, the game was fairly exciting. Until the end when the ref made a HORRIBLE call and ruined the whole experience for me, not to mention the rest of my night. Just ask Greg. I was bitter. The ref allowed Tennessee to win on free throws with .3 seconds left. Not only did it scar a otherwise good game, it allowed Pat Summit, who i really dislike, and the Tennesse Volunteers ( Ms. Burkes favorite team) to win. Not good. We want Tennessee to lose as mcuh as possible. Also, whats up with this girl winning the slam dunk contest?!?! Her dunks were crap. The guys in the contest must of had some lousy dunks. They probably let her win becasue she is like one of three women on the whole planet that can dunk.   Along with the new layout, Watch the Lamb is going to start featuring new excting 'things' for its loyal viewers to enjoy (probably a little to much than they should.) We all must get our shits and giggles somehow I guess. The new features will range from random tidbits of information I learn each day, to song of the day, question of the day, and other ranodm things that are probably more for my enjoyment and fun than anything else. So here we go:  Recommendations of the Day: 1.) If its a rainy day and you want a movie that is jsut pure excitement and entertainment, go see Dawn of the Dead. Its just a fun movie to watch. 2.) If you don't want exctiement, watch womens basketball.  Fact of the Day:  Greg you already no this one, but, a elephant excretes 220 pounds of poop a day.    In the words of Ray Boltz, clap your hands for Jesus. (And Watch the Lamb)
