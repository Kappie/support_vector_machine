He had some semi-traumatic experiences on Sunday growing up which is why he doesn't like Sundays.  Traumatic might not be the right word to use as it wasn't like he was facing danger or anything.  Just some bad experiences.  That is in the past but still there are remnants.  He brings this up just for a small detail he will discuss later.  But to start it out Tyke woke up on Sunday and then heard the vibration (yeah, he heard not felt the vibe) of his cell thanks to Dotti's text.  It was about Refuge tonight and Tyke planned on going-more about that later.  Tyke went to Macaroon's house in the afternoon with Amed and they planned on going to Pike Place and making a video.  Well, that didn't assimilate but they still went to Crossroads (kinda an odd choice but still fun).  They went to Circuit City, Sports Authority, and then walked around the food court to buy lunch.  After that they went to Bartell's for some candy.  Cuz who doesn't go to Bartell's for candy, guys?  Really...be serious.  Bartell's is awesome.  On Tyke's post right now he has just noticed that the three Bartell's he typed previously are all perfectly lined up on the left of the screen.  They won't be when you read them though.  After Bartell's they went back to Macaroon's place for some bball loving.  Tyke played pretty well and won a game of 21.  They played an odd version of the game and they need to just finally decide on one set of rules and use those all the time so there aren't arguments.  After that Tyke retired to his abode and just hung out with his parents for a little.  His dad was sick earlier and now his mom got what he had so Tyke is hoping that he doesn't succumb to the power of the common cold.  He will fortify his defenses though with the superhuman strength of 1000 mg doses of the wonder drug Vitamin C.  That usually does the trick. Tyke hasn't gotten sick much since freshman year.  He got sick a lot that year though.  Stupid dirty school.  Made him all icky sicky.  So after that he worked on his new mix which has a wide range of taste.  From Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson to G-Unit and Twista featuring Kanye West and Jamie Foxx.  From Beyonce to Cassidy featuring R Kelly.  It is a hit though with Tyke...not that that is a surprise since he made the cd.  Well now he is listening to Everything by Fefe Dobson.  Yeah, now this is a girly song.  And it is awesome!!  NOSome really.  If Tyke hasn't told you what that means it is this: awesome with a kick of N.O.S. to make it more powerful.  He just coined that a week or two ago.  Kinda gay but he is a coiner.  Nonetheless he uses it cuz he made it up.  Tyke then realized after making the cd that it was 8 and he had forgotten about Refuge.  So yet again, he didn't make it.  But that was ok with Dotti, she just didn't want him to be sitting there alone which is why she re-texted him.  Awww...how nice of her.  Tyke would like to talk about Purdy and Haras and the rest of his friends that love to see their names mentioned in the blog but in order to have that happen Tyke really needs something to talk about.  Sometimes Tyke takes care of that himself by having flashbacks to moments in the past but not all the time.  He would like to have a flashforward though to like 8 years in the future.  He wants to see who he is dating.  Cuz that is really all that is important to him in the future.  What girl he likes.  Obsessed?  Yep.  But he can't do much about that.  Other than not talk about it on a website where anyone could see it.  But whatcha gonna do?  Come on.  Tyke just wants someone.  Hey guys, remember these types of blogs from Tyke?  Those were the days.  The lonely days.  Even though at the moment of writing this he and Dr. Phil Lelee are talking about dying young and single and people who die single period.  Not that it will happen to Tyke but still...kinda weird to think about.  Tyke also has now had quite a long streak of blogging about his days events.  Since November he believes.  He went through them yesterday trying to figure it out but he realized he couldn't without reading a little of the blog because some of the days he blogged on a Sunday about Saturday and on Saturday he didn't blog at all.  But that still counts as blogging for the day.  And this counts as blogging for the day as well.
