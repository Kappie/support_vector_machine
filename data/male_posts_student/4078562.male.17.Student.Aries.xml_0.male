Its not just about like sex and weed (while there is plenty of that) but goes into racial stereotypes, which, even if offensive some of the time, can always produce a laugh.  The white people in the movie are portrayed by A:a group of skater kids who drink mountain dew and eat  Extreme Doritoes  and B: Cops, and all this other stuff which i dont really wanna explain.  I found the white people the funniest part of the movie.  Recommendation to all under 30.  Hope to see The Village soon.  Didnt wake up till 1:30 today...pretty nifty.
