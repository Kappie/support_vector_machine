I was so lucky, I feel very guilty posting about it, but for those who don't already know, lets just say I made a lot of moolah tonight. THANK GOD FOR FERNANDO! Ask me if you need more details.  I got there pretty late, and I barely was able to wait on a table (hey that rhymes). I was nervous, but it was a lot of fun. I got really lucky, the people at my table knew each other and must have bought their tickets in a block so they could sit together. They were asking me to take pictures, to "avoid" certain balding men, get more wine, yadda yadda. I had never waited on anyone before, and it was cool to have feel that someone, somewhere needed you to do something for them. Somehow this whole experience was very inspiring, even before the tip jar started to overflow.   Stay tuned for Sunday's rehearsal...
