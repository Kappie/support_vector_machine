Once again we defeated our Senior rivals from Humboldt...except this time it was more indirect than direct. They didn't even place. But who is to complain.  Today I also saw American Wedding. Nothing too great, but it was a nice way to pass the time with  urlLink Chad  and  urlLink Rachel . Sorry for not posting.
