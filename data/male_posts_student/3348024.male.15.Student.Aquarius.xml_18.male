You see, one day I was playing baseball with Sammy Sosa and I said "You steroid pumpin, wife beating piece of shit."  He told me in a funny accent that has yet to disappear, "Me does it for ve basevball."  I said, "So the war is on, now I'm going to have to create a web page to tell this story." (Note that this information could very well be a lie, but I'm not going to just come out and say that.  That'd take away from the suspense.  I cannot be held responsible for my actions.)  So that's how this website came about... or is it?  Three years later,(today) I remembered this strange encounter with a wife beater and I said "Dog gonnit(I don't really say that in real life.  It just adds to the effect of the memory), I never made that web site."  So I got off the phone and made up a new song that went a little like this, "I've gotta write a story, oh yeah, i've got write a story about a wife beater."  Sooo... I got out of the car I was in,which apparently was still moving) jumped on top of a tall man's head, took my pants off and declared my independence from The US of A.  I made my own country called Utopia and lived happily ever after.  Unfortunately, being the kind of person who isn't content with sappy Hollywood endings, I married an Ass and contracted AIDS, which killed me soon after, bringing me to my reincarnation, which will be discussed later.  I decided today, to move my shit because in two days my other site will have a banner and annoying popups just because I'm not willing to pay to keep them from doing that shit.  The main reason though, is that other site was too goddamn restrictive.  the bitch had all the templates layed out for me and wouldn't let me move shit around or create new shit.
