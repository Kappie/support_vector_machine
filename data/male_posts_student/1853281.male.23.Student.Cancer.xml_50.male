Now i am reclining on the couch and becoming better aqainted with the ass groove in the loveseat while i watch too much television and lament the weather and my wilting social life. The shins sucked, went to go see them on friday, but they stopped taking comps whilst we were in line, it was ass crowded with junior high bobbysoxers on the first floor, and with twentysomthing hipsters(who were remarkably attractive in the main) on the mezzaine. I immediatly felt that i was going to sick up, from the crowd, the haze of ciggarett smoke, the half bottle of wine and three hal drink i had had earlier, and, no doubt, from the stench of unwashed preteen rising towards me. The sound was awfull and we left after four or five songs and watched charlies angels two instead. Saturday i met jannie and my aunt and two small cousins downtown to look at marshall feilds eighth floo(washed out colors and weak imagery) and than wander through the skyways looking at everything. I have had better times, but it was nice to see them nonetheless. yesterday i just read and cleaned, read and cleaned. cheers
