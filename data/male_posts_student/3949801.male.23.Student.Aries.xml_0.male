Why do people think that their opinion on your situation is somehow more important than your own? Why do they think that what their assessment and solution to the problems in your life are far more superior than your own? These questions are very puzzling to me. It must be ingrained in human nature to get into other peoples' business. I guess it's one thing to give a friend honest advice when they ask for it, but I don't see the point in trying to push your feelings about someone else's problems upon him or her. It's really just insulting because they are basically implying that they know  how to live your life better than you. It's like this crazy fucking cycle that never seems to let up. Do you want a friend or a second mom?  I think many people may be guilty of "giving others advice". The key is being able to identify when your opinion is actually wanted versus you just wanting to tell someone how they should live. If everyone could attain and practice this idea, then surely the world would be a much better place. So don't fucking tell me how to live my life. Don't tell me I have been a bad friend. Don't give me any shit about the choices I make because I have a lot more to worry about than your worthless fucking opinion.
