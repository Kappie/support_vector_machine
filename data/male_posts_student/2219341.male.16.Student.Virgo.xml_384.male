Mallory?  well honestly i dunno if that was my fault or not.  but i do kinda feel guilty for that one.  ha.  it seems i always find these great girls then somehow i lose them.   i think its probably my problems that mess up this stuff.  like i said... i'm screwed up.  it just makes me sick that i cant go back and fix this.  i mean... i know Kari probably thinks i'm just so messed up after all that i did.  ha... she has good reason to think i am.  but i dont wanna be remember by anyone as the sad little pathetic boy who couldnt control his feelings.  and so far i feel like thats all i've given people.  sigh... thats it for my sad pity post.  night kids.
