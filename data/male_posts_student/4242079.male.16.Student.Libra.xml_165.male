And although it was forced, and awkward, and a little slow, and defensive, it was one of the best conversations I've had for a very long time. How am I supposed to be honest?  Honest: I know what I want, and I know what she doesn't.  Dishonest: I never want it to happen again  Honest: I can see us being amazing friends in the future  Uncertainty: These feelings will fade  Talking. Admittedly, it is sometimes over rated. Sitting on the kitchen counter, staring at her, wishing I had something of value to offer. I was lost. But we've all been down this road before, and we've all seen me make these mistakes before.   you can sit there in complete silence and walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had
