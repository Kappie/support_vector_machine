It was fun though when AJ and Kaiser were around my side saying the funniest things. Randomly AJ says, "I  hate  fat people, I just wanna pop 'em." He said other funny stuff but there was one part where he blew the horn in my ear and I got pissed so I took it and pressed it and the whole school could probably hear it. Then I yelled... "AJ!! STOP PLAYING WITH THE SIREN!" Thank god we didn't get in trouble for disrupting a shitty track meet, what was the score 68 to 24? Longwood is incredible but at least I got my personal best in the 800... it's not good at all but it's kinda good for me... 2:36. Then I brought Dan and Paul home, ate sloppy joe's and did a shitload of homework along with Mr. Hennessy's lovely essays. )=
