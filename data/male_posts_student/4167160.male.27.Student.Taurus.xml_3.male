Rice often comes with miso soup because sticky rice makes you thirsty. Miso soup will be a kind of drink not to choke your throat with a chunk of rice.  Here, I cooked one stew and fried vegetable with rice and miso soup. In the stew, there is sliced carrots, chicken and freeze-dried tofu (ko-ya) . This type of stews is cooked in a soy sorse base soup(soy sorce, cooking sake, and sugar). The stir fried vegetables in the center have green bell pepper, leek, bok choy, bean sprout, and the brown thing is a piece of fish cake that I found in a Korean market.  This picture shows another feature of japanese supper other than meals, which is the number of dishes. If a family has 4 or 5 people, doing the dishes is a quite work. I think people like to separete meals in each bowl so that they keep thier own taste from mixing other souse even though mother spend more time in washing the dishes.   It took 30 mins for this meal.   urlLink    Japanese style dinner  urlLink
