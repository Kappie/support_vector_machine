So laziness took over. So the days.. the days.. the days have passed by quickly and slowly. Yesterday, me and my friends from Grant went to Six Flags. T'was a fun day and night. Andrea didn't buy me funnel cake --;; Damn you! I had no more money.. Enough money to be in debt with Anthony lol. Thanks a lot for the 2 bucks Anthony, you kept someone from starving to death. WoOT! Hehe. So anyways, we're seniors everybody!! (Those of my grade lol) And we have one more year to go. I went to graduation because of Knights and Ladies. Oh yeah, and tomorrow I have a Cancer Walk to go to because of Knights  Ladies too. Great huh? I've only gathered up 50 dollars when I'm supposed to have at least 100. Just great everybody! I love it. Oh yeah, you can't see my sarcasm there lol --; So the whole day tomorrow.. from 9am to 9pm.. I'll be at school. Walking and running and playing around with my friends from Knights and Ladies. And for that 100 dollars? I  will  get it. I swear to you! I need it desperately. Anybody want to donate money for a desperate person trying to donate to the Cancer American Society?  LOL!  Ahh.. how I miss blogging. And in another 3 weeks, I'll get tired of it. Great lifespan isn't it? Okay, time to plan out how I'm gonna get that extra 50 bucks.. Out.
