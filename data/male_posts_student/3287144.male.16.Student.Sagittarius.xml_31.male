A few tips for wanna-be decorators;    Paint barefooted, its cheaper to wash feat than buy new socks  If you use linen dust sheets - make sure they are thick enough else you get paint on the carpet like I did  Use a radio that doesn't matter if it gets paint on  If you can afford it, use rollers in a disposable fashion - they take years to clean    I will post a picture somewhere to show you the finished result... Until then; Fabius out.
