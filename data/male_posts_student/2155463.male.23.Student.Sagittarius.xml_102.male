Friday night went really well - we had a tripe-header for my softball team, and we actually won all three games and played REALLY well (the last game in particular).  I don't know what it is, but I've been having an inclination to go to a lot of Indians game lately, so I almost went up to the one on Friday - and man don't I wish I had now!  So anyway, that was basically Friday night (I know, not particularly exciting, but c'est la vie).  I woke up with all kinds of great plans for Saturday, including getting some Spanish homework done, but by the end of the day my grand plans had been decimated to being content with mowing the lawn and making a Wal-Mart run.  I once again was planning on going to the Indians game, but everyone bailed on me so I ditched that idea (which I'm really glad I did now - they got crushed).  I had parking at church today.  Parking is really easy - we actually have a traffic pattern for our parking lot (since it's set up really crazy), so we basically just stand out there and point to where people need to go or park (or hold up traffic so people can get out of their spaces and leave).  And it's kind of hard to miss us (and especially me) since we wear those orange vests you see construction works with).  Anyway, so I point out where this one guy needs to go and I KNOW he sees me, but his wife is sitting there pointing at another spot; sure enough, he goes where she points.  We all got a pretty good laugh analyzing that one later on (someone succinctly pointed out that he has to live with her every day, whereas he only has to deal with me once a month!). :P  As sad as it might seem, I actually feel like I accomplished something today simply because I washed my car.  Like most guys (at least, most guys I know) I don't necessarily keep up with cleaning all the time, and cleaning (and washing) my car is no exception.  So today I actually took the time to do some automotive clean-up (inside and outside) and do some amateur detailing (tire black, highlighting black strips, waxing everything, etc.).  So my car looks nice and spiffy now :D  Now I just need to do something about the engine...  OK, enough procrastinating...now I need to go do some Spanish :(  We might play v-ball tonight, so hopefully the weather cooperates :)
