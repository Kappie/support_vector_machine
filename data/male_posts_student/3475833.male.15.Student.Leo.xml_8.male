Damn you football, damn you to hell. Well, at least this camp. It's pretty gay, but oh well! It can't hurt. And I get a neat shirt, Loo!  So yeah, School's out for the summer! *crosses fingers* Hoping for that 3.75 gpa! Come on, I need it to get into post-secondary! Um.. I so hyper right now for some reason. It's kinda really weird. I need to clean my room. Wow, that was random. I need to go to sleep too. I'm also really itchy from them damn misquitos... And I have a sunburn on my face..  Not really much to say. I started a new book a few days ago... Burnt Offerings. Great book. I love Laurell K. Hamilton. I still have to read The Great Gatsby too. Loo, I'll spark note. Ramble Ramble Ramble. I'm done. I have nothing else to say.
