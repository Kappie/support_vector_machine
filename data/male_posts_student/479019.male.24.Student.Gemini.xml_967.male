Who are you people and why aren't you leaving comments?  Now playing:  Stiff Little Fingers  - Wasted Life  I'm a person that takes pleasure in making fun of people. Katrina at work and her animal obsession and cheery disposition is such an easy target. Then again so are the other 'nice' people that wander into the shop.  Speaking of that, I want to tell another story about some of the quirky people I come across at work.  So there's this old dude that's around in the mornings. He's a former alcoholic marine, who claims to be the driver in 4 hit and runs before finding Christ. He's an interesting dude that's got some 'interesting' things to say. He talks about how he could have easily got the shot off from the Dallas book depository that people claim Oswald shot (or didn't shoot) Kennedy from.  So one day, another old dude shows up as I'm sitting at one of the benches with the guy, and he greets the other guy with "How's your faith today?" That's a quirky greeting, even from a relatively open minded hellbound atheist like me.  Now playing:  Flogging Molly  - Drunken Lullabies  So anyway... they go one for a bit about their daily 'faith' level and then go into a discussion of someone who recently got married. This then transitions into a discussion of tits, ass, and legs.   I find it strange that people who are so paranoid about their faith, who have to reaffirm nonstop, can outright speak of the opposite sex in such objectifying ways. Not that weird shit doesn't come out of mouth (like my discussion of labia colors last weekend at a bbq)... but I don't live my life in fear of abiding by values that are contradictory to things that I do.   Now playing:  The Strokes  - Someday  Today was an ok day of work. It's kind of sad that our beloved manager is leaving us. I feel sort of bad for the people that are staying at the store following summer's end. It's a major upheavel of the staffing there. It's always a bummer when you stop seeing and talking to people you've come to know. I only have a few more weeks of work left.  ***
