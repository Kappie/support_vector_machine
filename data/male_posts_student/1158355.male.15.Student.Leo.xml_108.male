Sorry folks for now on I'll try to update it everyday but all I remember is on the 15th I went to Splish Splash with Jared, Paul and Vinny. Mrs. Stahl brought us, then I slept over Jared's. Splish Splash was fucking hilarious. At Jared's, Matt Margraf came over for a bit, and that kid's pretty hilarious. I worked out with Jared's weights. Wait I forgot to mention at Splish Splash how I screwed the tube, ran and surfed town the slides while people yelled "My lord that child is running on the slide!" Oh god, it was so funny. Paul and Jared met some lifeguard, got her number and now their taking a step out of reality. They think their gonna see her again. I guarantee they will never see each other again. Oh well, Vinny and I were dying laughing and doing all this crazy shit at Splish Splash. At night we took a walk, played Knockout and I actually did good, Vinny and I talked about morons of the grade below me, then we all watched Scary Movie 2 and in the morning, Father of The Bride but I didn't get to watch it all because I had to go to my cousin's. I got a haircut, then arrived at my cousin's out east. My 1st cousin and I (Chris) played hide and go seek to hide from our 2nd cousins...or 3rd cousins who aren't even allowed to watch Spongebob. As we were running to hide Chris ran right through the screen door and OH GOD IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING EVER!!!! Ok I can't fucking wait for Wednesday, I'm going to Six Flags with my kick ass cousins. Today I shopped with momma, then Kaiser and Ravin came over but then Ravin had to go, then we went to Matt's, ate dinner there and I met his cousins. We took 2 bike rides and I showed Matt the 2 new GI Joes on www.ebaumsworld.com. Nothing special, I came home and that's all.  And I'd like to dedicate this blog to very special Amanda Greco who influenced me to write this blog and get me back into the daily typing of this blogger. If it wasn't for you, my life would be a crumbled leaf...or something similiar....crumb cake?
