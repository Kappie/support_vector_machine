I am talking about extreme celebrity make-over... First there was extreme make-over. That sucked. I'll tell you why.  Women: - I am fat. I ate too much now i gained weight. I didn't know eating a bag of ships each day made me fat but thanks to these geniusses I now have a healthy body again and I won't eat chips anymore. From now on I follow a healthy diet. I order the healthiest hamburgers at McDonalds from now on... Thank you Extreme make-over. (see foamy on www.illwillpress.com for a nice piece about diets)  - My teeth are rotton. Since I'm six years old I haven't brushed my teeth. When I was 17 I wanted to kiss a boy but when I opened my mouth he fainted. How could I have known that you have to brush your teeth. Thanks to my hero's of extreme make-over I now have healthy teeth again. I have now bought a toothbrush together with soem water my teeth will look good as new for ever and ever.  - My boobs are too small. I really need to get them liften because otherwise boys won't notice me because I don't look like a slut and if I don't look like a slut then I am not interesting to anybody because I am a stupid, ignorant shitty person. Thanks to my friends of extreme make-over I know have such tits that I have a hard time walking up straight.  Men: - Teeth, see above  - Hair. My hair looks like Chad Bixler's hair. People see that that type of hair sucks. Because I'm a mindless zombie I totally agree. Thanks to those metrosexual guys from extreme make-over I now have some slick hair-do which ofcourse will stay this way forever. Thank you people...  - Weight, see above  Now there's something worse. Turning yourself into a celebrity. Do you really think that looking like a celebrity makes you less the dipshit than you really are? Those celebrities would probably puke if they saw you because they don't like their fans. They're only good to be kept in the spotlight.   They want a perfect body, don't want a perfect soul. They want us to notice, when they're not around. They which they were special, though they are not special...
