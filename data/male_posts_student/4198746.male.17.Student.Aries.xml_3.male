The first day of a fresh start to prove to everyone, our teachers, parents, and fellow friends, how intelligent we are. Many people look forward to this day, to see friends again or to show off their new clothes, shoes, etc. I, however, view it as just another day at school. There's nothing really special about it. What does this day have over any other day of the school year? I say there are only three instances where the day is different: 1. any day before a holiday 2. the last day of school 3. the day of an exam or report card. Why would anyone think the first day of school as an exciting day. It signals the start of going back to school for 180, or less, days. To me the first day of school is just like a Monday. Luckily, this is my last year. Hope all of you have a great year in high school or college.
