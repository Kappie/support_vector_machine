White "gay asshole" Mike and drug face turned up - biggets pair of assholes i've ever met. anyway...they left, the Basketball courts and we (marco and the rest of the group) went to the field to play some footy....all fun we burried some guys hand in grass, then we played take downs on the girls...  then i got a fone call from the sister asking me to go to the pub with her...  so i went to leigh went to the pub and we remenised about life and stuff - was great to talk to her. Wes, her fiancee is such a kid....heard some funny stories - but a really nice guy , and they both deserve a happy future and i hope they get it.  so i come home and watch films till 4am...what a day!
