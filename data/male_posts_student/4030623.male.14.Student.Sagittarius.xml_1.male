Why do others backstab other people? Discrimination?       Anyway, som much of these useless questions....        Today's one of my worst schooling days ( I've got worse non-school days : ) )... Our play, though very much unpolished, still manage to scrape a fifteen over twenty.... That's nice of our teacher, but worse thing is, I can imagine myself acting like a puppet before 35 people.... Hmmm...
