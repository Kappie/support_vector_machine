We beat them the 1st game pretty easily, then we lost to them in the 2nd game...again. I got so pissed off cuz this team totally sux cock, theyre pathetic. So i was pretty intense in the 3rd game, and sure enuff we won...so then we were off to the flight 4 finals against the flyers from chicago. They beat us the 1st game 25-23...then the 2nd game was insane and we pulled it off wit a win 31-29...then we lost a big lead and lost 13-15...so that was the last match of the season, it is both relieving and sad at the same time. Playin wit Chris and Mitch for the last time is kinda sad cuz those guyz r awesome, im gonna miss playin wit them to the max. Its relieving cuz now my official summer will start. Now i can do the things that i want to do...hang out wit my g/f, learn how to play the guitar, and im probly gonna play a lil bit more vball to keep my game in top form...and go to the weightroom, haha. So yeah...its ova. We leave Austin at 11:00 a.m. and we should get back at around 4:30ish or 5ish...that i have time to c the fireworkz, yipee! I miss steph to the max man, when i go to bed and when i listen to my music...i am alwayz thinkin of her...im so glad that shez my g/f...=D...payce outside folkz!
