Sweet stories all around - flowers, whitey almost shooting some dude in the face, frames and mattes, dharma and greg, stasi's pink socks... and fucking Castillo! THAT GUY IS HILARIOUS, and incredibly quick-witted! I never would have thought to say something so funny. Ok, I am out to go try and see a bunch of salmon try to swim upstream in a river (Whitey may liken that to watching 3 monkeys try to fuck a football. Landon, on the other hand, would liken it to watching someone try and put socks on an octopus).
