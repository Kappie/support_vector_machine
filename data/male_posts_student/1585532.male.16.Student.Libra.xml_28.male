Anyways, don't expect a photo update of me making it, mainly because I don't want to show you what techniques I'm using (yes I'm going to be mean and not tell you so there!).  I will show you the finished product of course.  Anyways, homework is starting pile up.... ::giant pile of homework attacks me::..
