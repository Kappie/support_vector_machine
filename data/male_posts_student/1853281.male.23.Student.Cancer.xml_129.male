That must end. got the last two seasons of Babylon five tonight, pounding thelast nails into my coffin of geekdom, but i love it, but fuck it, love me, love my geekdom. no other news except for the fact that i still have not spoken to my Dad about his engagement still, God that still freaks me out. nothing else new.
