He's not a dog, for God's sake!  Poor Cinnamon Bear.  He had no chance.  I think that the woman should have been shot instead of the wolf.  Thin the herd.  Put chlorine in the gene pool.  How unfair is this?  We have to end the life of a perfectly good grey wolf because some fucking idiot decided she wanted to "play" with him.  Anyone who has ever seen Bear, he was a gorgeous wolf.  Even in his old age, he appeared to be majestic and noble.  In my 4 years of working at the zoo, this is probably the saddest moment I've experienced.  Not even when we had to euthanize Mame was I this outraged.  Maybe its because it was a humans fault this time.  Its just another example of how stupid people do stupid shit and how these stupid people think that we can control nature.  "But Mike, isn't a zoo controlling nature?"  NO!  Zoos are essential in the conservation and preservation of certain species of animals.  It gives the animal a home free of resource competition and gives us a chance to observe and study these animals so we can take our research out into the wild.  We learn more about animal genetics, reproduction, husbandry, physiological information, and much more information on a daily basis.  On the basic level, it gives people the chance to see animals they never would normally see, and learn more about them so they too can help in the struggle for conservation.  I don't care if you don't like to see animals "behind bars" because if you can't see the zoological society for what it really is, then you are just as bad as this lady is.  Anyways, I hope they file charges against this moron and that she feels horrible for what she did.  If I hear that she sues the zoo, I think that its time to move to another country.  A senseless waste of life, really.  PS  Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull made a crude comment about the American Flag, and I couldn't agree more!  Do your own research on that one, kids.  I've got tests to take.
