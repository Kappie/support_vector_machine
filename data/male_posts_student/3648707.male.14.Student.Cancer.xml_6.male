And since kevin such a great friend, he realized that that convo was older than she said, so he threw it away, and then kevin helped me do something that felt awesome. since NONE of you could ever imagine what i am goin through, it felt awesome to let somethin off of my chest. but there is still so much more. i just need the ones who have been close to me to remain that way and i will be fine. Kevin, Eric, Jacky, Alex, with you guys here for me i can make it through the summer and start high school a lil less disturbed(couldnt think of another way to put it). peace and love to all.
