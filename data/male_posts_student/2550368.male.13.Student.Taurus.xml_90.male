Yeah...waits until now to get a cold. Go figure.  He installed FreeBSD 5.2.1...has been building forts for a two-day paintball war coming up in a month or so...may be joining the scouts to have some campout fun...is going to be a mallrat this weekend...and had a close encounter with a lovely lady named poison ivy.  And, Blogger seems to have changed their interface (again), Apple released AirTunes (my son and I are both getting one), and I'm moving. So...the blog will probably continue to be quiet.  Email Jeff all your chicken soup and maybe we'll see him when he's up to snuff again.
