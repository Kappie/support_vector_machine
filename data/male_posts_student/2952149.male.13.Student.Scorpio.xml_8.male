I am happy because it turns out my grandma didnt have a stroke. They still aren't sure what happened but atleast it wasn't a stroke. Whenever I get online nobody is ever on. I cant even go read my own blog because AOL is too gay. When I try to read it the parental control thing blocks it. If my dad types in his password it will let me go but then I think he is able to go to it also and I dont want him reading it because it is none of his business. lol. Tomorrow is the day we go back to school which I guess is good because I get to see my friends again. Plus, I miss Stacey (HINT HINT). Nothing really else to talk about but I may post later or tomorrow.
