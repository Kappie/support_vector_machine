I was listenin to that and then luke jones jus came and randomly called for me, i have to admit it was kinda scary but as loren ses meeting random people is good. So we went and woke jackman up which i enjoyed :). Then we went and called for wooze, when we got there we found out chadders was there so that made 5 of us. So we randomly went walkin up to balfour and met Gaz and his girlfriend ( i never can remember her name). Anyways after that me an wooze walked up to a computer shoppy place to see if they sold wireless cards but they didn't :/ But on the way back we met katie :) then we had one of our convos where we don't talk, Jess knows what I mean. then we found out she was meeting Jess and Jackman so we went along and ended up in the canal (very simplified). But inbetween i cut myself with a breadknife spoke to woosey's wahing machine which lex screwed up and carried my dog over hot tar. Its been a pretty cool random day i hope i have more of them. If you're reading this i hope to see you soon.  Tom
