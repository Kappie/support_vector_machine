Gmail, the google mail service is great, but hotmail lacks any fowarding service. And I'm not paying money to have email fowarded to a new account. What a crock.  I have loads of latin to do, so I instead of xanga-ing - I'm just gonna leave you with something actually amusing.   urlLink CUSHIONED PANTS FOR THE TRUE SPORTS FAN!
