Why? you ask again, I did something i should not have done, and that was tell a secret, one that when spilled out at the time didnt seem like such a Big deal at all? As of always you know of Sheila Hensley, I back stabed her monday bye telling Ronnie Dunagan (Taurus) that she was going out with Cameron Ernst (?) knowing the fact that Sheila already had a boyfriend Ronnie Told everyone and it spread like Wildfire. Why did i do this? I told Ronnie this so that he would once and for all that he didnothaveahell with Her! But this statement or truth quickly backfired on me and her the hardest of all. The next day in english long after word had gotten to her she started cutting me down with the heavy mixture of curse words and asking me why i did this to her and that "Real Friends dont back stab Wade!" I did not respond to this at any cost but instead sat like rock and waited for the Tidal Wave of harassment to End, but that was just the begining of the storm because that Trogledite of a Native American Bitch Jamie Mitchell(?) Stepped in and played good bitch by cursing me and asking such a ballistic question like "What the hell is your Problem?" i couldnt take it and so i did what Pocahontas (Jamie's Nickname) wanted me to do, walk out of english class and cruise the hallways. Doing so within no time at all I ran into Reliable Ronnie and we talked about the shit this was kicking up, Ronnie then said that if he went back to english he was gonna kick Camerons ass? But to my dismay that was starting to seem like some twisted reality when The principal Mr.Deerborn asked us where we were going and that he had been looking for us, so he took us back to class un-upset about this minor ordeal and we made are way back to class
