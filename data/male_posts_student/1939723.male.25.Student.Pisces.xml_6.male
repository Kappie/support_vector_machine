I wonder how many people will actually attend ;) Last week I went to our computing center and got a topic for my seminar paper. It will be about IPv6, but it is still open what the exact title will be.  The last two days I did some technical editing for two chapters of the upcoming "SuSE Linux 9 Bible", FTP and LDAP server management. And it's really fun :)) What amazes me, is that I got this 'job' by reading blogs. An activity which is regarded as entertainment by most people. And I have my GMail account from a Sun employee who offered it in his blog. Which reminds me, that I'll have to give him some feedback.  So, keep in mind: Bloggin is cool, but it's useful, too :))
