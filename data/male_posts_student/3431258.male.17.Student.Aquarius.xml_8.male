I have found my weapons of choice.A  Steyr Aught and a Socom, or a M79 Grenade Launcher and a Socom. I really like the speed, fast paced gameplay of this. It's funny, i expected Tribes 2 to be similar when i first downloaded it.   Had some talk with my parents, flamed a bit. It's not always fun, but sometimes necessary. Can't wait for July, so much stuff and people to see! I may be able to get a hand on Frozen Throne, finally!(Been dreaming of it since late september)   I am going to sleep soon enough.  Regards,  Zephyr
