I've dug myself a hole and dove into it. It is a rare occasion this summer that one can find a good time to converse with me. However, my disappearance isn't just out of choice- I have been taken hostage. My captor, however, isn't some machine gun toting extremist that captured me- it was my father. Yep, I'm a hostage in his office. I suppose it isn't that bad, though- I'm getting paid. I also get my license this month. woohoo...forgive me, I'm not as excited as most because I realize my acquisition of a license will only give my father more opportunities to tighten his grip around the balls of my summer. Oh well. Over and out.
