I figured I'm loosing money on it anyways so driving it ang putting miles on it won't hurt much.  Besides, now it has full coverage and we are driving what we are paying for.  I start school in one week.  Not nervous yet... but I gotta get signed up for classes still.  We're looking for a new job for me so Gpa can sell the business and I can go to school.  It's a long story but I'll let you know how it goes.  We are headed to Brian and Andreas so I will write more there maybe.  There's lots more to update you on...
