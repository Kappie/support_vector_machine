I got plastered though, and than had to go to my dentists appointment still drunk the next morning.  that was fun, though not as fun as having a hangover start at three in the afternoon, at work. friday went to Pracna for S's going away party, saturday was b-day dinner for my mom, and than met some friends at Tiburon. I liked it there, and it was really nice to see D again, had been a while. Went to Bolt and the Eagle afterward with F. and A., too crowded for me, and there was no chemistry with the guy F. introduced me to. thank back to the grindstone, with a surprise call on monday which meant i got a roomate.
