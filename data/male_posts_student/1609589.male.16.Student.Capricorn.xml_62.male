So for the next week, itll be extremely hard for me to go anywhere or do anything, i wont be able to finish(or even start) the drumbone until a week from tomorrow. Damn, this sucks.  Cant even drive yet, so im stuck at this damn place.  And i cant even call my mom to ask if i can go somewhere, cuz shes at school or work all day.  Can't have friends over, because theres no "supervision."  Ugh, i dont want to even type anymore right now. I dont wanna do anything right now.
