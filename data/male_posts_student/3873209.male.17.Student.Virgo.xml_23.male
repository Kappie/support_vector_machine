It seems really short now-wish it was longer :/ oh well-still-made the best of these holidays so yeah its been good =) and Collaroy Conference Centre is such a nice venue-with the beach, shops.... and us from ACES got the ensuites!!which were like 2-3 ppl in a room with its own bathroom-with hightech showerheads which do different weird stuff when u twist them :):):)    Monday-Day 1    Okay, so I woke up around 7:00AM on Monday morning as Nat was meant to pick me up around 9AM-after eating brekke (ham+eggs, and honey nutri-grain), waited up till around 9:15AM when Nat still hadn't turned up :/ so yeah called Eddie who was at Jeremy's place and found out they hadn't been picked up either-and they were meant to be picked up b4 me!! well-yeah found out that Nat was 1/2 an hr late..... and then he went to the wrong 74 Murray Farm Rd!! doh-yeah he went to the carlingford side instead of beecroft >.  Okay we arrived there about 10:50AM and it was raining a bit so we went off to eat some morning tea before having the welcoming session in the main auditorium. The camp's theme topic was 'The Cross of Christ', investigating God's infinite justice and yet also His infinite mercy. The session introduced the cross, and how the people during the Roman empire perceived criminals punished by the cross, and 'the madness of proclaiming a crucified God'. 4 points discussed included   -Crucifixion was a widespread public phenomenon during the time-it was a public penalty used as a deterrent against crime  -It was shameful-criminals who were crucified underwent the utmost public indignity, enduring mocking, spitting... etc  -It was restricted to the 'scumbags'-the lowest of society, to hardened criminals  -It was horrific/obscene-so obscene that it was not mentioned in public society-"Let even the name of the cross be kept away not only from the bodies of the citizens of Rome, but also from their thought, sight and hearing."--Cicero, 54BC   People of the time thought of the message of a crucified redeemer was ridiculous-with the example caricature 'Alexamenos worships his God', whereby worshipping Christ as God is like worshipping an ass.   We also learnt about the two different alternative theologies-  1) The theology of glory  2) The theology of the cross   (1) states that we can see and know the 'invisible things of God' by looking at the world he made and how it works, these 'invisible things' being 'virtue, godliness, wisdom, justice, goodness and so forth'. These characteristics seem to be what humans are to strive for, and of which find perfection in God. The theology of glory thus would mean that us humans can find a way to God through a 'glory road' where we may find God.   (2) states that we can only really know God by examining the 'invisible things of God' by what has actually happened/occurred-that we cannot say what God is or isnt, what He can or cannot do/be by our own preconceptions of who God is, but by rather what God has done. For example, we can make simplistic arguments that do not work-God is everywhere. Jesus when on earth was not everywhere. Hence Jesus is not God. Or another argument such as God has all authority and power, and is such cannot a servant and not humble, that God cannot look upon sin, but Jesus became as sin for us etcetera etcetera.... yeah quite interesting stuff and that was just the first day-the easiest actually!!   Then in the night session we went through the events leading up to and after the crucifixion-a relatively straightforward exercise - just to be hit with all the hard stuff on Tuesday :):):)   On Monday night we had a faculty time-which was great fun ^^ we had a competition to see which group could build the best tower made out of straw, based on criteria such as height, aesthetic appeal and the amount of weight it could lift. In my team was Jeremy, Hannah and Borin-and we all set to work. We first decided that we'd just go all out for height-so we put straws in each other to make really really long straws-but then we found out that it must support at least 1 of the weights to be in the competition, so we bent them around to form like a dome shape. So we kinda scrapped the goal of making the tallest tower towards making it as strong as we could-it ended up being quite dodgyish, unbalanced, but at least it was.... um-'flexible' and 'adjustible' =P and Jeremy with the last few minutes just decided to wrap lots upon lots of sticky tape all around our tower-kinda mucked it up but anyway ^^ it ended up being neither tall or strong...it just ended up looking more like a volcano than a tower lol-actually we didnt do too badly-we came 2nd last!! yay!!    Tuesday - Day 2       This day was absolutely crazy-if u havent heard of it before, the 'confusion curve' is a curve that describes confused ANCON ppl are throughout the camp-and Tuesday night is usually the point where everybody is the most confused =S the morning session was relatively straightforward, discussing the gospel and ministry-how we may be tempted to change the gospel to make it more 'palatable'. However, the problem is not with the gospel-it is with the receiver- 'If the gospel is veiled or ineffective, then it is veiled to those who are perishing'. Although we may be frustrated, we should still present the gospel wholly, without distorting the message.   After lunch we all went off to the beach for the sandcastle building competition. ACES had built a big 'boot' for a sandcastle- loltho Borin didnt recognise what it was when we saw it completed :P the sandcastle that ended up winning was of a dragon-which at first sight I'd had thought was a stegosaurus, and Borin'd thought was an alligator..... yeah neither of us had noticed the wings lol >.  Now for the mind-boggling stuff at the main session-our salvation is via an act of God, not just a messageof God-this makes it such that its not by us responding to God that we are saved, as God saved us through this act.We learnt funky words such as 'immanent' Trinity, and 'economic' Trinity, the alternatives to Trinitarian Christianity such as Modalism and Arianism-confused yet?! I was!! Trinitarian Christianity postulates that  1) There is one God  2) Jesus is God,the Holy Spirit is God, and the Father is God  3) Jesus is not the Spirit,and both arenot the Father.   Modalism states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are God, who is just playing different roles as the Father, Son and HolySpirit. Why this doesnt work is then that we can't really know God at all-we just see God 'acting' in different roles, and cannot know whoGod really is.   Arianism states that there are 3 different Gods-tritheism. That the Father is God, while the Son is a lesser God and the Spirit an even lesser God. This removes the gospel-as it is not really God who saves us but a lesser God.   Other points we discussed werethat the Son is notjust an object of the Father's action. That he was an 'innocent bystander' punished for oursins. As such would be an'immoral salvation'. For example, ifthedaughter ina family had done something wrong, and then the son was punished for herwrongdoing, then such a punishment would be'immoral'.  As J. Stott put it, 'Wemust not then, speak of God punishing Jesus or Jesus persuading God, for to do so is to set them over against each other as if they acted independently of each other or were even in conflict with each other. We must never make Christ the object ofGod's punishment or God the object of Christ's persuasion, for both God and Christwere subjects not objects, taking the intiative to save us sinners.'   As you can see by now, quite complicated/deep stuff. Then we had a question time after supper, where the main session speaker, AndrewKatay, answered questions from the audience.Question time was reallygood=D withreally difficult answers from the audienceanswered very well by Andrew-learnt alot there too!!Questions about Triniarianism, Calvanism,etceterawere all answeredbyAndrew along with his good sense of humor =) i gtgout now - going out to eat dinner=D i'll finish this off some other time- l8rz!!
