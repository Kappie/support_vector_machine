[21:19] Eric: soon your life will be so light it will fly away and you'll be running after it! [21:19] Camden: good image. [21:19] Eric: and you'll run down the street yelling "Somebody catch my life!" [21:20] Camden: and then some big burly guy in a leather jacket reaches up, snags it, and tries to sell if back for fifty bucks. [21:20] Camden: at which point I'll tell him that's a rip-off. [21:20] Eric: And someone will interpret that as a cry for attention, and a beautiful lady will make her your love slave. She'll try to be your romantic partner, but you would have no life at that point. [21:20] Eric: or that. [21:20] Camden: No no, I like yours better. [21:20] Eric: ^_^ [21:20] Eric: Thought you might. [21:21] Camden: you know me well. [21:21] Eric: No. I know people well. [21:21] Camden: or, you know the straight-teenage-male stereotype well. [21:21] Eric: ^ that was me being deep. Be impressed o_O. [21:21] Camden: am impressed [21:21] Camden: deleriously so. [21:21] Eric: what does being straight have anything to do with it. >_ [21:22] Eric: we just don't talk about it because then big scary straight men like you beat us up. [21:22] Camden: ah [21:22] Camden: my mistake [21:22] Camden: I beg your pardon [21:22] Camden: before I shall beat you for a pulp for mentioning that your kind has sexual urges. [21:23] Eric: no problem [21:23] Eric: after all, society has rules that must be followed [21:23] Camden: yup. [21:23] Eric: if gay people arent oppressed, who will be? [21:23] Camden: probably jewish people. [21:23] Eric: exactly [21:23] Camden: guess you're kinda screwed then. [21:24] Eric: or productive responsible reproducing members of society, and we can't have them being oppressed. they actually matter ^^. [21:24] Eric: Yea, I guess so. [21:24] Camden: ack [21:24] Camden: finals suck. [21:25] Eric: So I like to think of my daily beatings by the entire Paly Football Team as beneficial for society as a whole. Not to mention important for releasing the built-up homosexuality in them.
