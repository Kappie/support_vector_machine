So yea ummm sunday "B" Corps as usual we got some new songs and things to work on but its starting to come a little routine so Im used to it now... It is still the highlight of my weeks but being with the Renegades on sunday was amazing so i dunno i was kinda drum corps out but i did get a compliment from Shawn on my marching which was kinda cool. But this weekend we dont have to go so by next weekend ill be ready again. (if that made since), so im not too excited about my long weekend, on fri i have mucho music rehearsals for hawaii and for barbershop. FUN? i think not! On sat im singing to people and hanging out with Sadia, (not too excited bout sat, lets just say there something that I really dont want to do to someone) but ill leave it at that. Sun nothing due to the "B" corps break which means ill either sit at home or the "OREO" will strike yet again. Then monday dunno..the story of my life. So yea I will ttyl IM me sometime cya
