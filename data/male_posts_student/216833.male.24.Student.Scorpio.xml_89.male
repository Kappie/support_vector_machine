I watched a few good movies during the weekend, sat around the house most of last night, and have just been going to work at my normal time.  I read a bit of those books I got from the library. Evolution and history. The idea of evolution interests me. Unlike most people who go to public school, I was taught at home during my highschool years and my history and science books were religiously biased. Creation was taught, and the Christian agenda was splattered on every page. I was bright enough to see it, and I just went on. To me, I had to find out on my own both sides of that coin before I made a decision. I still don't know enough about evolution to make it totally clear that I could teach someone else. I think once you understand an idea well enough to pass on the information correctly, you know what you are talking about, otherwise, it is best left unearthed. I am feeling a little dull and bored.
