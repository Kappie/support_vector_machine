Meanwhile, Blogger had revamped their blogging tool and added some nice new tags such as the recent posts, comments, and profile. Hmm, just added the recent post feature. For comments I'll still use Haloscan. I've changed some of the links and add a few new blog. Take a look for yourself. :)  Planned to write about my trip to Kuching but I'm just plain lazy. :P Have to brush up client's website here so that made me a bit busy. Anyway I promise to write part of the trip especially the  'naik sampan'  part.
