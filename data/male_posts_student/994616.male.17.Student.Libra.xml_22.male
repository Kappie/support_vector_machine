I am so incredulously proud of my self. I am handing in three english essays tomorrow for english, Mrs Alderson's going to be happy. i am so fantasticlaly stupafied, im going to be tired tomorrow though, i cant get to bed untill about 11:30 DAMN YOU DARIA!  i spend all of last night figuring out how much i have to save a week if i want to be able to afford a mini, the answer my friend is $180. so im fucked! or if im lucky $160. so we all know what that means don't we? TIME TO GET A JOB. mm i know what your all thinking, pfft yeah mike work? pfft. well your probably right, but i'll try to get a job on thurs / friday/saturday. i mean if i can do 4 hours of studying then im sure i can look for a job.   i wrote out a description of my idea mini but it came across as pretencious so its gone. I have been carrying around the price list and manual looking at it every chance i get, i think i have a new company crush... although i already had a thing for bmw and everyone knows that BMW owns mini. thats why the mini is so safe (6 airbags) what i will say is that i want a red one with a white roofi probalby wont end up getting one they're too expensive... bastards
