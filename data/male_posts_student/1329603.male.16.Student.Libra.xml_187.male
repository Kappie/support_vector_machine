I am really, really, sorry, if anything goes wrong for any of you as a result of me existing over the next few days. I have a huge fear that something really very bad has happened and that I am directly responsible. I don't know the action which caused it, and I don't know what's happened, but I've just been completely overcome with a deep sense of regret and despair. I'm sorry. I love you all (those that I know read this) so much, and my brain isn't coping with the burden of an apparent massive guilt.  Love, Jon Roskilly
