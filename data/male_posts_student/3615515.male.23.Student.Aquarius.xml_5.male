What is it that will give me a sense of purpose? Fifty years from now, what would I like to refer to as the work of my life? What am I doing today that is in the direction of the work of my life? Does the “work of my life” only refer to starting up one’s own company? If yes, do I have the entrepreneurial spirit in me to actually go through the trials and tribulations of starting up on my own? And will I not be happy if I take up a comfy, well paying and secure job in some MNC and climb up the corporate ladder one step at a time and be content with a good happy family life?  It would be wrong to say that the only way to achieve a sense of purpose is through your career. Surely, there are other things you could be proud of. Is Aditya not the pride of my parents? Can they not look at his smiling face proudly and say that he is the work of their life? They surely can. I often wonder whether life is to be treated as a race or a journey. For most part of my life, I’ve treated it as a race and at times have found myself asking – Whom am I racing against? Am I racing against myself? There are questions and more questions. I just hope I soon find the answer to at least some of them.
