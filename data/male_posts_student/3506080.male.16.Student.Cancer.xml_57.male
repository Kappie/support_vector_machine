Unfortunately our old bandwidth provider for those worlds has suddenly ceased trading, and so we've had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  The worlds are being moved across now, to a different cabinet in the same building, and should hopefully be back up in a few hours time.  Meanwhile you can keep playing anyway, please just use another world, and I'll post again as soon as they are back.  Thanks Andrew  *Taken From  urlLink www.runescape.com   This does indeed suck.
