We used to have one of these a while back but it ended up dying out as people moved away or became too consumed with work/school.  So we are giving it another try.  It was nice because it provided an open forum to talk about whatever you like such as things going on , things  we don't like, upcomming hang out sessions, or just whatever the hell you want.   This is suppose to be a happy place for all so don't get excessively crude or mean.  If you do your posts will be deleted and you will be banned.  And just as a reminder to any of you who may be newbies:  make sure when you write a post to not only post it, but click on the "publish" button as well.
