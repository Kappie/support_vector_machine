Then this lady wearing a sailor's suit came out and asked us what we were doing and we just said "looking around the boat". So she walked us around the boat. Then all i remember was us in this kind of desert place and it had a consession stand (i know this desert has issues)and there were people from the boat out there with sonya and me. So then Sonya and I were standing in line and she was all " I don't wanna stand in the FREAKIN' LINE ANYMORE!!" Then there was this river time thing and the carton of eggs she has she threw them in there. Then the unbelieveable happened, these big green vines came out of the water and there was this guy closer to the water than us and it picked him up and detached themselves and transported him somewhere as he screamed. Then there were all theses other people that wanted to do it and they all started throwing stones and stuff in the water and they went along soaing through the air screaming and laughing. Then we were the only people left sonya, me, this model lady, and another man the threw this stones in the water.   {I've never had De Javu in a dream before so this was a first, i mean like i hada dream once that i was supposed to jump onto the vines after sonya hitched a ride with the guy that threwn the rocks, yeah it's kinda weird}  After the guy threw in his rocks the model lady hitched a ride with him and so did sonya and i got on with her. And at the top on the vines there was this big huge rock and it transported us to a place that looked like Greece and it was just beautiful. There was this one lady there and she was showing us around her little village type place or whatever it was kewl. So yeah then sonya and I were out of the picture and it went on to that lady that was showing us around her village and her roommate and they were ahving cookies and milk and looking at picture of high skewl boys and  she said " is it wrong to want to be with a high school guy?" and  then she was eatin here cookies in the bed and said what am i talkin about? But the thing about this is she then showed up at the school that the guy was at that she liked and she was lokingbaround  and she walkin into the gym and there were these two guys in a sleepin bag making out ( don't ask me why I had this dream i'm just the messenger) and uin the sleepin bag was the guy she liked and she said hi. Then after that she was the two guys got out of the sleepin bag and the guy she liked ( that's too long of a phrase i'm just gunna say "alan") started to talk toi her and she told him that she enrolled into the school, to be with him. And then they started going out and these guys wanted to beat up alan's ex like a week later and they then he had to stand up for him and he got beat up. Then the lady said ever since these two months  that i've been here all i've caused is trouble. And she wanted to leave and go back to Greece and the guy persuaded her not to got and he gate her this plate of peppered pepperoni and carrots with these black things on the side. And she said "I guess this dish'll have to introduced to Greece some other time"  then they all started laugh alan, his ex, the lady who was now a high school student and alan other friend.   I guess you could say they lived happily ever after, but i still don't know what this dream is supposed to mean to me, except that it was really weird.
