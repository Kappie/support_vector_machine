Buy it, or you shall perish! Ahahaha!  I also have the audiobully's album, but I don't expect you to have heard of them, because you think dance is $hit. (VICKY!) ahem.  That is good too. I also got the last Discworld Novel that I haven't read, and one of those cool  urlLink  Airzooka  things. It is very cool, but my dog doesn't like it.     In 2 days The Daves (like the hives, only different) and myself are off to Campedowne, which I cannot spell. There we will scuba dive, mong, talk and miss you all terribly. For those of you who wish to get in touch, our mobiles will be turned on on the evening, but not anytime else to conserve battery. If we do not reply, assume one of the following:       We have no battery left     We have no credit left     We are dead         Our phone has been stolen     We hate you (only joking, hahahahaha! Had you for a minute, but I can see we didn't fool you really, you canny bugger. :-D)    Anyway, you will be without us for 9 days! NINE WHOLE DAYS! We will miss you all terribly, and I'm sure you will pretend to miss us too.    Rob  xXx      >
