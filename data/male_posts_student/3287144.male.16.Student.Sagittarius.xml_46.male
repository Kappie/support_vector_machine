Anyway...  Today I got my hands on a copy of  Practical Photographer  which is a very interesting read, quite inspiring to me really... I just need to get a camera.  Among my revision I also had to happen upon some bhangra songs, they're not that bad to be honest, not my thing, but most certainly listenable.  My apologies for this being like a list in awfully short paragraphs, so to end that I have one of my dreams to write up; I find myself as a soldier in a kind of marsh area which we are attacking, after a bitter fight forward I board one amphibious vehicle and advance forward where after climbing what looks to be an embankment, the vehicle becomes a small yellow boat.  I find myself the commander of a fleet of similar boats and we advance on the retreating enemy, about half way across this ocean of sorts, I predicted that they would try to counter attack. In preparation I drew up the rest of my fleet and readied to defend which we successfully did, now they retreated with no hope of winning so I paddle furiously with my hands to another similar dinghy, on getting close the solitary sailor jumps over board and one of my men jumps on to replace him [where he came from I do not know], we then paddle back with the extra boat. Well just another day with just another dream.
