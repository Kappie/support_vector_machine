Also accomplished the inevitable Canadian must-dos of eating poutine and spending about a litre of Canadian change that somehow smuggles its way south. You hear me, Canucks? We don't want your looney money! I'm half-Canadian, but based on the exchange rate I'm now half-American and 40% Canadian. I think the other 10% got moved to Mexico. Muy problemo!  CD purchases $5 Canadian each!  Handsome Boy Modeling School, "So...How' Your Girl?" John Coltrane, "The Gentle Side of John Coltrane" Sonic Youth, "Goo" Primus, "Pork Soda"  Great albums all!
