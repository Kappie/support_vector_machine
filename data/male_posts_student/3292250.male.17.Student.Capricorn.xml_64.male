But I've seen two numbers performed offstage ( When I Get My Name In Lights  during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and  Not the Boy Next Door  on the Tony's), and I've got the soundtrack. Hugh Jackman plays an impressive Peter Allen and pulls off the production very well. Unlike his London performance of  Oklahoma! , he feels natural in this role. Using even more talent, he plays a surpassingly believable (and cute) gay man in the show.
