I have write an 'In-class Essay' tomorrow for English... It's dead stupid. 76 minutes to write something intellectual about  Othello ? I'd have better odds against a fool with a machete. Speaking of fools. I know lots of them. For instance; there was a car accident today at school. This kid who lives up my road (I think he hates my guts...) he probably screeched out of the car park, like most of the drivers try to do and got barrelling down the road off to some unknown restaurant in order to purchase some desired greasy, fatty food for lunch. And then, come storming back to school, in the company of foolish friends and finish up the rest of the day absorbing knowledge like a sponge. Not. It was funnu though because I was walking home for lunch (I like two seconds away) and I heard a tremendous clatter and instantly thought "Hah, it would be funny if someone went into the ditch." Only to hear ten minutes later from my thick as two short plants brother that someone had. Upon my return to school, he was sat on the bonnet of his faded red Jeep Cherokee with a solumn look upon his sunglassed obscured face. Indeed the noon-hour today happened with great incident.
