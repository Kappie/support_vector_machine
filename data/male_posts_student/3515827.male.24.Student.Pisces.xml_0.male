But every now and again I give in to the convenience and hope that this time, this time it will taste good.  With that said, I like Chick-Fil-A more so than any other fast food joint.  But I have always found it interesting that a fast food chain very openly integrates Christianity with their business plan.  They explain why they are closed on Sundays via a plaque as you walk in and on their  urlLink website .  (Read more about Truett Cathy, the founder of Chick-Fil-A, and his Christian principles on page twelve and thirteen of this  urlLink story .)  I just find this all very interesting for a fast food restaurant is all.  Now if they were pushing some type of liberal pagan screed, I guarantee that double chin O'Reilly would be calling for a boycott.    But it is also just a bit creepy to eat there.  First off, you're greeted with: "It's a great Day at Chick-Fil-A, how can I help you?" and when your order is complete, it's been their "pleasure"  Those poor children.  Probably making no more than a dime over minimum wage and they have to utter that crap at every customer.  I know I would never make it, but I guess they don't mind. The last time I was there, a couple of the employees along with their manager were quoting biblical passages back and forth to one another.  Now that was a bit much.  But what really makes me laugh is that when you buy a breakfast meal, you get a free copy of the Moonie Times.  What a tired rag, even if it is ran by our savior, Rev. Sun Myung Moon.  If the people at Chick-Fil-A even had the slightest knowledge of the blasphemous blather of this nincompoop, they would burn his paper on the spot.  To find out more about this loon, check out the following salon articles:  - urlLink Hail to the Moon king , all about his crowning ceremony in DC to celebrate his national tour of tearing down crucifixes across the US. -and  urlLink Bad Moon on the rise  where we find:  His gospel: Jesus failed because he never attained worldly power. Moon will succeed, he says, by purifying our sex-corrupted culture, and that includes cleaning up gays ("dung-eating dogs," as he calls them) and American women ("a line of prostitutes"). Jews had better repent, too. (Moon claims that the Holocaust was payback for the crucifixion of Christ: "Through the principle of indemnity, Hitler killed 6 million Jews.")     But I suppose Rev Moon can't be all that bad, according to him both Hitler and Stalin have endorsed him as  urlLink "none other than humanity's Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord and True Parent."   And that type of sponsorship you just don't make up.
