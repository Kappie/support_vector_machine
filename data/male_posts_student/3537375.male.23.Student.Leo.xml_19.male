Given I have no need for normal radio stations, I immediately start listening to talk radio. Uninterested in the current Rush Limbaugh tirade on liberals, I switch to public radio hoping for some classical music to sooth my soul. To my horror, the current broadcast is Michael Moore doing some sort of standup comedy. It was real weird to say the least. I don't know if he was in Bush smear mode or if he was genuinely trying to be funny. Being the open minded fool that I am, I decided to listen to Mike's comments. To say Mike makes broad assumptions is an understatement. He was complaining about 160 million Americans that did not vote for Bush in 2000. I could verify that # but I rather not spend the extra effort since he probably made it up or made another legendary broad generalization. I figure he extrapolated that comment from the 150 million people who choose not to vote or even register in the last election. Now that's an assumption, they did not vote for anyone so they did not want Bush. That rationale is easy to follow.   So Mike continued his rant about his publisher was oppressing his First Amendment rights by asking him to edit some passages of his book, ostensibly "Fat stupid white men" I think. Mike, your First Amendment rights do not include the right to have your thoughts published. Just like you, the publisher wants to make money and can publish whatever they see fit free from government repression. Note the publisher is a private company, no First Amendment analysis needed. Of course the next 15 minutes was Mike lauded his book as being in touch with America and hitting the best seller lists with impact. Mike, a lot of books become best sellers, a good portion aren't worth much. Nonetheless, I digress. I figure this is a great segue into my review of Bowling for Columbine (Bowling), which I recently viewed. Shout out to Ryan for loaning me the DVD.
