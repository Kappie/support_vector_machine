I'm assuming his black or a moreno or both.  It doesn't really matter.  The thing is between me and him we're the only colored guys in the class, unless Chad counts, but meh... Calling azns colored always feels awkward even if it's proper.  As a side note, when I use the word colored I usually mean anyone who isn't white.  White is a very general term though.  Some arabs could be counted as white, and the aryans who live in central Asia/India/Iran etc. many of them could also be considered white.  But everyone else, and I do mean everyone else  technically  is colored.  Middle Aged to Older black people will often use this to mean exclusively black people.  Anyway, I found the mass class situation interesting, since I've always been bothered by being the only colored fella.  Secondly, chruch, oh church.  It's one of the strongest enforces of memes it's kind of insane.  It can spread so insanely fast, and I just can't understand why education hasn't taken a few pages from religion, just look how easy it is to learn a religion and spread it to someone else.
