To kickstart this entry, FS was fun today, did basic Set Theory...its a nice feeling to have when u know how to do everthing...mwahahahahahaha. PSP1 was well...less entertaining...i am getting left behind in Java...guess i will try to get back on track after the violin exam which is not too far away...  Played CS with marianne, andrew, zaki, samuel and guohua aka Tearing Face...reduced gravity until we were flying around Matrix style...pretty amusing when we were flying around trying to knife each other to death!! Things got funnier when tiek hee joined in..soon we were firing off dual pistols Matrix style...with the flying effects and all! But what really cracked us up was when andrew and i, being Ct's, ganged up on tiek hee bywe two flying sideways in opposite directions while firingaway...it was  seriously  like a scene out of The Matrix...  Took a nap when i reached home..dont know why, but i was dead beat when i was in 154....i was seriously soused out man....and i dont think i really strained my eyes or anything....  Violin accompaniment went better than the previous two sessions...felt like i was becoming more used to the piano accompaniment..though intonation is still quite, quite bad......haiz....  Collected my new spec frames...then went home...let mei listen to Jay Chou's new single..then packed up and headed for yuhua. What else can you expect when u put the grads together in a bus?  Utter, Total,  MADNESS.   Got Shehui screaming when i let her listen to the new single by Jay....haha  Man...a thousand four hundred strong combined school chinese orchestra, further strengthened by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, it was a dream come true...many people find it funny that due to my very, very strong preference to English songs and given my violin musical background, its queer that i am a sucker too for chinese orchestral music...what can i say man...i am just going back to my roots yea? Oh yeeea....anyway back to the concert, could see it was a huge major event, with people like DPM Lee himself gracing the event! Music got me grooving...though i felt that in one particular movement, the special computer sound effects kinda spoilt the authentic oriental feeling that sends me reeling into ecstasy..well thats exaggerating a bit but hey, you get the idea....  Had supper at samuel's auntie's place again...and all i wanted was a Henny's! Shared a bottle with good ole george treatin me...wahahaha one fine day i will treat him to a pint of Erdinger...now  that  isone beer that youwill never everget in the coffeeshops yea?  Yea chatted a while until we hit 11.45, then we had to start heading for home...Ys and sam ever wary of my beer-induced rambling...especially when we were in the taxi..haha hey u gotta admit, its kinda fun to mislead the taxi driver.....yes? LOL  Thats all then...took a bath to quickly get rid of the alcohol fumes before dad or mum found out...and yeap, here i am now, blogging...yeap think thats all...need to hit the hay...wanna be in yuhua by nine tomorrow so yea, later people.
