But what if a simple sword, a cutlass if you will, could cut reality open, revealing its true secrets to the world. Could you truly alter your life to your pleasing, making everything happen your way? That brings me to my next point, your truest desires. Reality makes itself whole on creating these desires that are unreachable. Hence why reality isn't perfect. I truly cannot see what actually would happen to the world if reality would be in our power to control. I just cannot under any circumstances why we would want the perfect life. There would be nothing to live for, just a plain, expected world. Then, as my final word, take this into consideration-If you expect the unexpected, does the unexpected than become the expected? So long my fearless readers.
