This time he is angry because Halliburton doesn't pay enough taxes to 'give back' to the country that has been so good to them.  Once again, he goes into the 'no bid contract' that really was awarded before 9/11 for general emergency services to the Pentagon.    You know, when I have a good 'story' about corruption, no matter how juicy it might seem, occasionally the truth proves me wrong and I can't run with it.  There were a couple of Clinton scandals that ended up being false, so I dropped them from my standard arsenal of reasons why Clinton was the devil.  It seems truth has little effect on the Left.  They just keep repeating the distortion.
