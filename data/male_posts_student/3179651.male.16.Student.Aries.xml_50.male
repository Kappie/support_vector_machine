This is the reason I have never dated anyone younger than me, and I intend to keep it that way.      On to a more positive note...I get out of school in 11 fucking days. Hmmmmm...now just what can I do to shock everyone at graduation? Any suggestions?       Note: I thought I was in love when I was 15 and 16, but I was actually getting emotionally abused. Now that's love. I have still never been in love and look at how many relationships I have been in since then. Point expressed.
