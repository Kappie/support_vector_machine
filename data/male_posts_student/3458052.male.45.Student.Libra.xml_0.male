I was however raised in the greater Los Angeles area where they take driving seriously. In LA we invented the freeway shooting. Screw up behind the wheel and the slugs will fly.      Here in great Northwest, it's shocking. These folk grew up driving in rain and snow and on ice. Yet the worst drivers are here. It's a series of roads inhabited by lemmings. When one brakes, they all break.      Anyway, fellow cosmonauts, before I go on on should tell you three plus years ago I took up residency in an insane asylum. I live with insane people. I used to consider myself only slightly abnormal yet now realize the full depth of my damage. I must be the most insane person there because I have been residing there by choice!      Back to bad drivers. Here are questions and statements I have felt both compelled and obligated to say in the last 48 hours to those behind the wheel:   "Please do the planet a favor and do not reproduce"   " Sir, did you purchase your license off eBay?" Follow up to his profane reply: "Why are you wearing a bandana, are you a pirate?"    "Sir, your turn indicator is not functioning" Follow up to "Yes it is"    "oh, must be your brain that is not functioning"  No reader, I have nothing better to do with my time. The perfect job for me would be driving around and revoking on the spot the driving rights of the moronic.      And people wonder why all my friends are a**h*les!
