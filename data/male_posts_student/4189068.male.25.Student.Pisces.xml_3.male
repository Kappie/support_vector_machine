Upon entering the bar, I noticed it was filled with what appeared to be a hateful mix of gun-toting muskrat pushers and disenchanted farmhands.  I ordered a double whiskey neat and asked the bartender to keep the motherfucker full.  I had every reason to get drunk today.  It was Sunday and I am not religious.   I was coming off of a very nasty experience with cough syrup and vicodin, and a particularly bad night with a woman from Detroit, and if you've ever spent a night with a woman from Detroit, you'll know what I'm talking about.  So I'm getting hammered and I go to put something on the jukebox.  The only thing worth listening to was Johnny Cash, and I never really bought into the whole hipster-johhny-cash thing, but I thought what the fuck and I put it on.  This gap-toothed charlie walks up to me and asks if I put on the song.  I say "yeah," and he tells me, "I don't want to listen to this shit."  "Well, there are two more songs of this same shit coming on, so I'd get used to it if I were you."  That was a pretty fucking stupid thing to say, but like I said, I was feeling fatalistic and already a little drunk.  Cocksucker laughs at me, looks back at his cadre of braindead charlies, and asks, "what the fuck is a pussy like you doing here?"  "Getting drunk." I bite my tongue.   "Why don't you get drunk at some pussy bar?"  "This one's cheap."  He got up and went back over the where he was sitting, and then a minute later yells, "Don't put any more of that shit on the jukebox, pussy."  "Sure thing, chief."  I paid my bill and left.
