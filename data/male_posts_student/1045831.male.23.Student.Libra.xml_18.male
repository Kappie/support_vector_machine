I have thought about catching up and writing a bunch but I decided to forget about thatand just start from today.  Last night I worked and went to Fatso's for Jay's Bday and going away party since he is going to war in Iraq along with some other guys in our house.  I had a few beers then went home.  Pretty uneventful but I think I am going to go to the wheel to hang out tonight so that should be alright, hang with some nice folks.  Alright well all this writing has tired me out.  I need to get back in training but I'll write more later.
