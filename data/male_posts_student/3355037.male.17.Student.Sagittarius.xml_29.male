(dont worry, i am mentally healthy...) no but seriously though. i wonder what the point to life is at all. all life consists of is birth, growth, reproduction, death. dammit whats the point of it all?? someone tell me. eh. i think i am just in a depressed mood for some reason. oh well. have fun with this post.
