Israel is always pressured to give up land that it won in the 1967 Six Day War to the Arabs.  I think that all of the surrounding countries and Israel should give up some land for a Palestinian state.  Egypt could give up some of the land in the Sinai Peninsula.  Jordan could cede some land bordering on the West Bank, most of which would be given up by Israel, with the exception of settlements on the border on the Green Line which have now become legitimate suburbs of large Israeli cities.  I  think that this could be a viable solution to this urgent and pressing crisis.
