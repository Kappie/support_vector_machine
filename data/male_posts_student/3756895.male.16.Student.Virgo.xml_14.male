I guess I've got no skills left anymore. Lol. We then made our way to Darius's house to chill and swim(Again). We had fun again and did some stupid shet again. Love it when we do that. ^^  Well, I was about to go home when SC said that he was too exhausted to even walk. I've got no choice but to stay over at Darius's house again. Lol. Fortunately, Darius's dad wasn't home. But sadly, we didn't do much. Those 2 went to sleep at about 1am? Lol. I played SG at Darius's house from 11pm to 4.30am. Sorry Darius. Didn't tell you about it. =X  I went home yesterday at about 2pm. Slept again and didn't do anything. Time flies and it was this morning. I didn't go to sch cause I forgot to set my alarm. Damn, gonna get screwed tml. I had a LLLLOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG chat with my mum about Poly and JC stuff. I kinda made up my mind to go to Poly if they allow me to enter at this time. Life sux in JC. Sadly.  Then, I went to SC's house at about 6pm to talk to both Darius and SC about my decision to go to Poly. Darius promised to help me find out about the admission to Poly. Man, love how these 2 guys help me so much. I followed them to UE Square where they had their first lesson for dancing. Lol. Looked kinda funny. While waiting for their lessons to end, i went over to Liang Court and ate Macs. It had been 6 years since I went to Liang Court. Pretty much the same, prolly because my memories aren't as vivid as before already. Took cab+bus home and here I am blogging. Yawns. Time to sleep. Gotta go to sch tml. =(  Ciao.  sczwdar. wiggers4lyfe.
