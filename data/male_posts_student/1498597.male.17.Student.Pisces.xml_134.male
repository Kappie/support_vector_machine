Well, its kinda been a while since I've blogged, and no one is angrier than I am when I take a look at myself and see that I haven't been fuckin' updatin' my own damn blog, or the  Three Eye Witnesses  either!!!  What the hell is up with me anyway?!  I'll tell ya!  Its my fuckin' dumbshit school!  Can't ya feel how much fuckin' school spirit I have?!  Grrr...theres a lotta projects that  us ,  the students , or rather,  the slaves  must complete!  Trust the school to dump all this shit on us at the end of the year, when summer is so damn close, you can just....you can...you...AARRRRGGHHH!!!  I think I can vent for all of us when I say:   "FUCKIN' SCHOOL, FUCKIN' SCHOOL, DRIVE US INTO THE GROUND LIKE SLAVES!!!  OPPRESSION THAT CAN RIVAL THAT OF THE THIRD REICH!!!  YOU FUCKIN' BASTARDS!!!  DIE SHITHEADS, DIE!!!"   More to come...!
