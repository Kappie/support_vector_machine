But I can't, if it is a well made movie then it makes you want to say and watch, it makes you want to help the main character, it makes you sad, and you cna't help but smile when the entirerly too predictable ending comes.  The main character is always clueless and completely flat in character.  And in the end they will be better off than you, and you know it, but you still can't help but feel what they feel and know this is your story just with the ending you haven't gotten to yet.  You almost feel home, and no matter how much you tell yourself that it is a movie and a horrible one at that, you can't ignor the fact that so much of it is more believable than the life  you're living.   Not exactly sure what I want trying to say there, but I think I said what I wanted to say.   So... about 2 hours til my driver's test... hmm I'm kind of nervous, but I don't know I feel like as long as I watch my speed, stop before crosswalks, and dont' hit the curb on the way out, I should be fine... Whoo, driving is going to be pretty great, I think...  Hmm, haven't been playing my bass lately...  I won't be home until tomorrow afternoon.  Duck Tape... wow I haven't made even half of what I need for the Arts Fest... I'll have to pull an all nighter the next couple of days... What is your favorite kind of flower?  Well I've been random long enought, I'll be leaving now, try not to be too sad...  -Dan V
