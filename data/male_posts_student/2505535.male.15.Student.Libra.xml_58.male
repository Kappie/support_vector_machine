Last night was alot of fun, went round to Heather's where there were lots of people, we watched  urlLink View Askew  films; Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, by the time we'd watched all that it was 3am so I decided to walk home instead of staying the night and seeing one more (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) cos I was tres tired.  And friday I had an inset day, it wasn't so great, but in the evening Jon and Big Dan came back from somewhere, and we played Mario Golf, the term "Doing a Daniel" is now what we use for when someone completely fucks up their putting.  Don't think I'm gunna do much today, but right I'm talking to Brooke, he's very happy.. heh heh.. Then I'm gunna play some more video/computer games, as always, yay.
