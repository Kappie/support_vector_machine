And my heart is breaking in front of me, But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say 'Goodbye' anymore. -Maroon 5, "This Love"   The first was SO FUN! god, i noe april's fools is like a kiddie holiday, but i love it fo sho. i gave my grandma a heart attack by putting red food dye on my hand and getting a knife, saying i cut myself. ha ha ha. uhh shonick's class was really fun. it was good turning in my ABORTION REPORT! what what. english was kinda boring though...  friday was really fun. at the end of the mile my speed really kicks in. mrs. locke says this is because adrenaline surges out of your brains and makes you work harder. this explains why everyone was in such a good mood the last day before spring break. i spent my open planning my whole spring break, and in pe i worked my ass of during our "track" lesson. french was the funnest. i taped a picture of a fish on mrs keplingers back because she said that april fools day was like a fish holiday or something. dont ask. it was great though. then nathalie and i drew a picture on the board that said "Happy Spring Break!" it was tres cute.  SCHOOL'S OUT~!!  i spent the rest of the night watching movies and staying up late on the phone with tina and nat. just like things were supposed to be.  saturday- i slept. seriously. it felt orgasmic.  sunday- i totally did all my homework and caught up on all the hot gossip. my mom took me shopping and i bought gossip girls and new socks and wife beaters.. who came up with that name? i think it was stephanie hammond.. or jude law.  monday- after hanging out with nora i went to see eternal sunshine with jaye at the movies. it was HOT! and jaye looked hella cute in his abercrombie vintage t. after the movies we were gonna get jamba juice but i felt all hot and sticky from sitting for 2 and something hours. so i went home and tanned.  wednesday - nathalie and i totally busted out at the mall. we had tons of fun and lots of laughs. AND WE BOUGHT THE FISH!! and burger king! and we saw damon and he was retarded. but what's new? oh yeah, chris cancelled on me to see dawn of the dead that day. or did i cancel on him? so not hot for that boy anymore.  thursday - i went to the movies with dominic. he wore a PINK shirt. still, i give him props for looking so cute in it. haha.. we had tons of fun watchin lady killers. except the title is freaky and everyone died. then i went home and changed.. and i went to see hiltago with jack. but we skipped the movies and i ended up giving him a tour of soquel. RC's REAL NAME IS RAUL!! WOAH!! thats crazy. we did alotta craz shit that'll probably give me a boner radomly during class. then a security gaurd came. now i noe what anna felt like in the A list. mm mm mm  friday - i read all the gossip girls! so good! omg i am so in love with chuck! and blair is the coolest chica since annie ross! has anyone heard from gardenia?  saturday - it was a totally 80's day! nathalie, crystal and i went to the mall! it was awesome until crystal had to leave.. we got jamba juice and we chilled on her iPod! there was a HUGE cutie on a bike too.. woaH! anyone, we walked home in the cold and yeah.. i took a nice shower. flip flops on cold days = no. gossip girl spotted me and put me on her site! i also saw tina and sarah in the mall. it was cool! and sarah looks really good. tina.. well she looks the same..  sunday = easter. i slept a lot and my parents went over to my aunts and uncles. i didnt pracicularly want to go, so i slept in and they had fun and nathalie called.. i dont like eater egg hunts.. but nathalie had funw ith hers! i slept a lot and got ready for school.  monday back was great. i swapped stories with everyone and handed out hugs like it was graduation night. i dont remember much from the day except giving amber a HUGE hug.. and that's about it..  tuesday - counselors came in to talk to us during english. again, it motivated me. i found myself signing up for the same classes, minus piano and pe. i also added leadership. it felt good. shonick's class.. uhh.. i dont remember. OH I WAS STOKED FOR HEALTH.  wednesday- christina's cousin came and her and i hung out in 2nd quad reading today.. after pe i ran to the locker to get jack's card. it was his big big BIRTHDAY! woo! i kissed mesha on accident because i was so excited. it was chill though. uhh we got to harbor and nathalie and i jumped out of the car. we walked down the hill while everyone called our names. when we reached jaye we handed him the rose and card. he didnt want to take it cause he was embarassed so i shoved it in his back pack and nathalie and i hurried up the hill. two girls chased us, d'auria and stacie and nathalie and i jumped in le voiture (thats car in french), but not before chatting with elena rossman.  my mom drove us to jamba juice and nathalie got a yummy carribean passion and i god a razz razz razzmatazz. yum. jack called to say he loved his gift, but then again, how could he not :-P? we got back to school waaay after the bell rang. we walked from the circle parking lot around the side of the 1st building and up the trail witht he two trees that leaned agaisnt each other. then jenica called us from the girl's locker room. she came out and we walked to french together. we had a psycho sub and some chick who knew NOTHING about european history (JOAN OF ARC WASN'T HUNG JUST BECAUSE SHE WORE MEN'S CLOTHING. WHAT A BIMB.) gave us a lecture about fashion and how we should desgin and shit. ooooh chanel! yummy. well after that we had to do a worksheet on past tense verbs.. except keppie hadn't taught us that yet. how sad. the day was over and i went home and fell asleep. i think i should take this time to give a BIG SHOUT OUT to JACK! his birthday was one of the more entertaining days of april :-*  thursday was pretty boring, we had a sub in PIANO!? crazy crazy. it was really weird cause.. he was telling us his life story about african drummers and casondra and i just decided to fall asleep. friday was the same. elizabeth and i had a fun chat in pe about uhh.. jack's birthday? yeah.. and then french was boring.. like usual. i complained my ass off about the sub. what a crack head. AND WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT OTHER SUB IN PE?? HUH?? IS IT NATIONAL FREAK SUB WEEK. i swear. he looked like he was half woman, half fisherman. and fishing gear has totally been out since the 80's. duh.  FINALLY. THE WEEKEND. i made up all my homework and then i tanned tanned tanned. farewell to manzanar was pretty entertaining. even without jake there to explain everything to me. i watched a ton of movies and finished all my homework. and then it was monday. woo. back to school. to tell you the truth, nothing exciting happened this whole week. we finished up the six weeks as usual.  in piano cassondra and i practiced and played like crazy. we even stayed in the band room past the bell, by accident. those sound proof rooms are dangerous.  english went by like normal. we kept reading farwell to manzanar and we watched a lot of biast movies toward the governemnt and how they "wrongfully" imprissoned the Japanese. well at least gardenia was there to keep it chill.  tuesday was really cool! HAPPY 420 EVERYONE! rc thought it was childish.. but fuck him. no really, ;-). uhh my 420 was DOPE! we all had a lot of fun, even though i didnt smke or any shit like that. so proud. emily didnt either. im proud of her. tessa got really baked and we laughed at random things. anyone, it was all really fun. was that jack smoking over the phone? huh? :-P  pe was mega boring. fitness testing drove mrs. locke crazy. we did sit ups and push ups everyday like 200000000000 times and we ran the mile every time she could squeeze it in. track was super fun though!  on wednesday we had the track meet. shay was looking fine in his shades as i raced bach li down the hurdes and passed the baton off to david girr on the 4 by 100 hundred. HOT. elizabeth is my new favorite pe person. with gradenia and lizzette. la la la la la.  in geometrey.. FIRST PERIOD.. we took the math test.
