Marbles and i sat out in the garage with the back door and the garage door open and just listened.  beautiful.  i really do love rain.  it just makes me feel so good.  yeah.  i did somethin that i never really thought i'd do today... i read some old papers.  i'll  leave out which papers they were... but it was weird looking at them.  cute... but sad.  very strange.  goodnight kids... sleep well.
