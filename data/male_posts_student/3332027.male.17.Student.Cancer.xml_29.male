But you know, i couldn't so i was real sad. We ended up going to time square and watchin JoJo on TrL. Went to McDonalds and ate there. He called his new boi on my phone. It never bothered me before. But today it did. Him leaving and plus him calling him on my phone was just a reality check. He said its gonna be the same you know; he's gonna call me sometimes and he gone be back in August. I didn't have a chance to say it, but I wanted to tell him it's not going to be the same. He's gonna work it out with this new person from Rhode Island. He gonna be tight with him and he gonna talk to me less. We ain't gonna click like on that level anymore. there won't be anymore booty calls 'cause they is going to make it work. So my ex, if you reading this, I just wanna say, it's not going to be the same. ou is going to really move on and I'm going to be here still at the same place. And you might not even comeback for all i know. You could just stop talking to me and thats it. You gonna be a whole month away from me and you gonna have time to really distant yourself from me. Don't say it's going to be the same because it's not. People become different when you seperate themselves from another for a long period of time; especially when they is with someone new. I know, cause I've experienced it. That's why i was quiet and had that face. It wasn't only cause I was going to miss you but what you said it was just: (!BLaH!) That's that.  Here's my song for this blog.    Michelle Branch - Goodbye To You        Of all the things I've believed in I just want to get it over with Tears form behind my eyes But I do not cry Counting the days that pass me by   I've been searching deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old It feels like I'm starting all over again The last three years were just pretend And I said,   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light But it's not right   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time I want what's yours and I want what's mine I want you But I'm not giving in this time   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And when the stars fall I will lie awake You're my shooting star
