Anyway on to the good stuff...  On the Unwritten Law show last night:   It was much better than when they opened for Blink-182 at the UCI Bren Events Center 2 years ago. The show had a great music festival feel due to being outdoors on the student center lawn, despite the gloomy weather. Girls flashing and an awesome pit despite people not really knowing how to mosh. Not many punk rock veterans ( what do you expect from a school that's 60% Asian? ); however, everyone was there to have a good time, which is great. It was a good 1 hour plus long set of real hard punk with some pop-ish and metal-ish stuff tossed it. I had a great time and thought it was an awesome show. This is one of the times when I'm proud of going to UCI.    That's it from me. Off to work...  ****
