For those of you who don't know, UCSD econ PhD students have to pass at least two (sometimes three) qualifying exams in the core fields of macro, micro, and econometrics.  I took the macro and micro and passed them both.  The pass rate was just over half on both exams.  Therein lies my problem with this whole arrangement.  These exams test students' quickness in regurgitating a bunch of math learned during the first year.  But who really needs to log-linearize an ugly monetary business-cycle model apart from those of us going on to do macro?  Who really needs to derive the integrability problem on the spot?  Integrability is abstruse enough that our only exposure to it was when one of the professors had a grand mal seizure and bit one of the students.  True story.  These exams test the ability to take a test.  That's it.  They don't delve deeply into the skills needed to do research.  At the end of the first year I feel like I'm no more prepared to do research than when I started.  There's no guidance as to how to select something interesting as a topic.  Nothing about how to model effectively.  Nothing about the history of our profession apart from a few anecdotes.  There was one professor who'd use as a catchphrase, "We're all good mathematicians, so..." after which I'd audibly gag.  I'm not a good mathematician.  I'm an economist who can take a derivative and do some simple matrix algebra.  In reality this amounts to little more than hazing.  "I had to sit through Arrow-Debreu so you will too."  Wouldn't paddling and excessive drinking be much more efficient?  Surely less painful.
