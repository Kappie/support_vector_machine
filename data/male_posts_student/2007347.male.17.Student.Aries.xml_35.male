We spent out time here  Jamie, Chris and that other guy showed up. That was fun, I haven't seen Chris for ages. They're from Griffith doing music.   For some reason the girls launched into a lovely conversation about periods and other girl talk before the other fellows got there. So I was the only male with my screaming "WTF!!!"  Kate suggested we make something out of this every Monday.
