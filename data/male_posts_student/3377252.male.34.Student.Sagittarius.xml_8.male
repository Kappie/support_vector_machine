Just noticed I write 'well' quite a bit, must have some reaganisms within me.  I was not especially fond of our former president mainly because when he was in power I was rebellious teenager, now I am older I have adopted some of his principles and values, those who really know me though know I will hardly ever be classifed as a "conservative."  I find little in this world which does not need to a major shake-up.  This is one of the major reasons I proclaim Jesus as Lord, I do not belong to this world and I do not mix too well with the values and aspirations the world advertises.  I once heard prayer is the ultimate act of rebellion against the status quo!!!!!!!!!  I like that, let us perservere and strive to transform this nation, civilization and world into something which will resemble our Fathers world.   "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn    " `a man against his father,     a daughter against her mother,   a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--      MT 10:36 a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'      MT 10:37 "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38 and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.      MT 10:40 "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. 41 Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward. 42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward."
