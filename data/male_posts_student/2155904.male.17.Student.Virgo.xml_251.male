Tyke woke up at about, oh, noon, and after that he went upstairs and his bro was home talking with his mom and then they talked about his trip cross country to D.C. for law school.  He is driving himself all the way across the country and keeping his car there so he has to move everything.  It's going to be interesting.  He leaves on Saturday.  One week from today.  So Tyke is pretty soon going to be even more of an only child, even if he is going to be at Pullman anyway.  That will be quite a trip though.  Driving all the way across the country by himself.  Gotta admire that go-getterness.  After talking about that trip they talked about Tyke's college plans and his schedule.  They looked at possible changes to his schedule like trying to put in Com101 cuz that will be his major but it really doesn't work out.  Tyke should have a pretty easy time though.  But his second semester might be pretty hard.  It will probably be 16 or 17 credits as opposed to 14.  And right now two of the classes Tyke is taking he has pretty much taken before so hopefully that will mean he can really have a high GPA and excel early on cuz it is a cutthroat college of communications he wants to be a part of and to get in he has to be good.  Well after his brother left Tyke played some Hoyle Casino 2004 and he lost a lot of money.  He lost most of it on the horses though.  Damn that Purple Prancer.  Lost Tyke about $8000.  That should have been an omen for the night but Tyke didn't take it as one.  His parents left at 5 something to go to a friends' house for the night so Tyke went to Teriyaki Bistro for dinner and coincidentally ran into Dr. Phil there.  He was with his Cali friends and Amed was there earlier too.  After a little while they got a poker game going at Dr. Phil's house with Amed, the Cali boys, DCups, Macaroon, and Dr. Phil's dad.  It was a pretty damn big pot tonight.  $230 when Tyke left.  Tyke started off getting crap for a long time.  He spotted DCups 10 bucks and later got that paid back but Tyke still ended up being in 30 when it was all said and done.  He was even up for a little while thanks heavily to Dr. Phil's dad but that ended up going down the crapper.  A tough hand with QQ and A10 and then right after A10 Tyke got AJ and ended up getting outdrawn by Dr. Phil to take him out.  Tyke was pretty mad when he was out.  He usually doesn't get mad losing money but this is the most he's ever lost and he didn't lose it in ways he liked.  It just put him in a bad mood.  Listening to DC on the way home couldn't even make it a sad mood.  Instead it remained a bad mood and then when he got home it went away when he told his parents about the game.  First thing his mom said, "230 dollars?!?!?!?!?"  Yes, mom but I lost 30.  Tyke told his dad about how DCups got both quad Js and a straight flush off the flop in 2 of his hands.  And there was another hand with quad 5s later.  Then some full houses too.  It was just a big night really.  Tyke really wanted to win some money but he didn't.  When he got home though he took a 20 that his parents owed him but Tyke just decided he would leave it until now.  So he only lost 10 tonight and DCups still owes him 10 too.  Tomorrow it looks like there might be a basketball game going on so Tyke will probably join that.  Other than that he has no plans so give him a call and set something up with him.  He'd love to join.
