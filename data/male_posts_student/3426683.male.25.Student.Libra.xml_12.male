Bush went to war on advice of Vice President Cheney who consulted con man to neocons, Ahmed Chalabi. Not clear whether Quigley or Chalabi had better fix on reality."    urlLink Bush presidencies: two men, two roads  -- some food for thought:  "'Bush One was a reluctant but major architect of the successful effort to balance the budget, eliminate deficits, and create surpluses,' said Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office who worked closely on the 1990 budget deal under the senior Bush. 'Bush Two has taken surpluses and transformed them into large and persistent deficits that represent a more serious threat to our economy than did the deficits faced by his father.'  "The deficit hit a peak of $341 billion in 1992 under the senior Bush, was replaced by surpluses during the Clinton administration, but soared back to $353 billion in 2003 under the junior Bush, said Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Those figures are adjusted for inflation, providing what economists consider to be the fairest comparison. In actual dollars, the comparison is even more stark: The deficit reached a peak of $269 billion under the senior Bush and a peak of $521 billion under his son, Reischauer said."    urlLink Nine traits that predict great presidents  -- this includes: "Tender-mindedness, that is, concern for the less fortunate, predicts both presidential success and ethical behavior on the job. FDR and Lincoln scored high on this trait, while James Buchanan and Nixon scored low."
