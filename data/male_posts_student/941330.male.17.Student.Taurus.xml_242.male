THAT'S PATHETIC. hence, the nfl will never allow another mtv-produced halftime, and i say  urlLink good riddance , considering that the show was upstaged by the nfl players singing tomorrow. then there was that ridiculous bit with the  urlLink guy disguised as a referee  stripping on the middle of the field and doing some texas two-step deal. greg gumbel: "i think we've had an omen that the second half will be filled with lots of raw, naked football."  then i caught some  urlLink survivor: all-stars . memories of the first survivor! where's colleen! rejoicing in the dehydration of random bitchy rich people! lots of raw, naked richard! woo!
