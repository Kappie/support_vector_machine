It was full of ducks and Canadian Geese.  Ducks are very interesting to watch.  Afterwards we walked up to a Seven Eleven and got some chow.  Then we went home, thats it.  -  I haven't been online that much the past two days or so, because we were hit with an annoying trojan.  And, through the combined effort of my dad and myself, it got worse.  However, five minutes alone looking at it's behavior and digging up some stuff on it, I found out what it was and how to kill it.  ----------------------------------------------------------  CWS (CoolWebSearch) Infection  How you get infected - Certain porn popups from ANYWHERE, including clean sites, still unknown which ones, that exploit a hole in Java.  From what I've seen, this hole is only found in Windows XP.  Charateristics - Constant pop-ups, hindering activity by sucking virtual memory dry, the prefix "nkvd.us\1525" placed onto your default browser everytime you try to visit a site, and an attempted opening of ports for the attack "Newtear" through random masked IP addresses.  How to treat - Download "CWShredder" which can be found  urlLink here .  You then run it, do what it says, and it should treat the problem.  You can see the difference by using  urlLink HijackThis  (I suggest you ask an expert to look at the findings from HijackThis, because problems can be caused by deleting things that you shouldn't).  How to avoid - Well, if you don't have XP, I'm unsure if you can get it.  XP users, the hole can be closed manually, but if you have applied the Service Pack 1, it's been closed for you.  Also, use a program called  urlLink Ad-Aware .  It's a free program that scans for Adware, such as the infamous Gator crap we've all put up with.  ---------------------------------  Anyway, thats about enough for today.
