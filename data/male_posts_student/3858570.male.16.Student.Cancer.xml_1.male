Mark slept over last night and we played games and watched The Pirates of the Carribean, which was an absolutley fantastic film (my rating 41/2/5). Anywayz then the next morning we went to my 2nd favorite Burger joint (aside from LEE's of course) Bud's Broiler. Excellent burgers.    After we ate lunch we went into Kmart and bought candy and shit and got our long-ass reciepts. After doin that we caught I,Robot and noon(my 2nd time seeing it) Which is still a awesome flick. Then after we scurried ourselves to see Spiderman 2 and i gotta say i was somewhat dissapointed (3/5 stars).     After Spiderman 2 we kinda romed around Lakeside while admiring my EXCELLENT parking job :). Then we just went to the Esplanade mall coz we were bored.    Today was an awesome day and i look forward to seein more of my old friends. I realized more today than ever that i really miss u guys.
