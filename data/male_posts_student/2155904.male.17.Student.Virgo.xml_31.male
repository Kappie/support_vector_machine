(haha I am so funny because I used alliteration to say that last sentence...unbelievable!)  But seriously folks, Tuesday was good.  Tyke had Sub-Dub day (two subsititutes) which is always a bonus.  And right now a really good song is playing which makes Tyke in a better mood for writing this which means when he reflects upon what he was doing during the day he remembers more of the good then the bad.  Ahh yes, Tina.  Well today guess what she talked to Tyke about?  Yeah that's right...THIS BLOG!!!!!!  Well that almost got awkward.  No she has not read this, yet at least.  But she was like, "so I hear that you have a website?" and he was like, "ummm yeah who'd ya hear that from?" and she said Purdy and then asked what it was about.  And he was like, "you mean the url, address, or just what it was about?" and luckily she just wanted to know what it was about.  So he told her it was just his life and interesting stories and that he made up names and then he told her all the names.  But this was kind of a relief for him that she hasn't read these words he posts.  Because that could make a very very very very very awkward situation.  At first when he started the site he didn't think he would mind if she read it and he kinda wanted her to but after this scare it probably would be a bad thing to do.  Things are pretty good as they are and since he knows that all he is hoping for with her right now is a friendship if she reads the site and gets freaked out then he could lose her friendship and that would be awful.  Well, all for now because this is starting to be the opposite of happy.  Who let the dogs out?  TYKE DID!!!!!!!!
