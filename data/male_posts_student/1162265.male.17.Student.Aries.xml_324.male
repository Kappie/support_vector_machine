On Saturday morning my parents left early to go to Art's Fest in Baltimore. They do that yearly but they were going to let me and nia stay home alone. No problems yet. I was supposed to go over to Grandma's house at 10AM, I woke up 12 something. I figured she would have come by so I went down ate breakfast, and called her. She wasn't home. Fine, life goes on. Tom wants to come over, Tom comes over.   Grandama calls around 2 or 3. "Marcus I'm coming by." "Well Grandma, one of my friends is over." She comes by seems slightly annoyed that her, to quote her, 'Favorite Grandson' is playing video games with his friend rather then boarding up her windows. So Nia is glad to go, and make some money. Grandma calls around 2 or 2 1/2 hours later. "Where do you want to go for dinner?" "Tom is still over." "When is he going? I don't feel confortable with you having friends over when your parents aren't home." I just rolled my eyes, and told him he should go my grandma was acting psycho.  So we eat at Eagle Rock. She starts talking about this courtcase she was on the jury for where some kid invited his friend over and did something, she speaks far to generally to understand when she tells stories. So I'm thinking "Grandma, I'm 17, not 10. I should be able to handle simple things like this." But of course, you just bite your tongue around grandma. She said some other stuff that got to me, stuff about people's hair not looking right, and how Gennine wasn't going to get a job with all her holes in her ear, and her tongue pierced. Ironically she did get the with dyfs (whatever the acronym is), and is far more successful then Grandma would lead me to believe....  To much of a rant. But that's all I do isn't it?
