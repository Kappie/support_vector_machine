Of course I would rather have the reader think it is something else: like me getting inspiration at the wrong times--while taking a shower, for example--or my memory being so short term that by the time I make it to the computer thoughts are gone. Whatever. Just have it be something that still makes me feel like a "writer".  My perfect excuse is this: my graduation thesis is sucking away all my words. Yes! That one just works beautifully. Lets put the blame on school. I mean, after parents, there really is no many people to blame for this sort of thing, except oneself. And the first rule of life is to never admit guilt unless there is no way out--in which case it doesn't matter, so why do it?  Another thing I can do is claim embarrassment by my use of English. After all, writing in a second language is not the easiest thing. Even more, it is particularly upsetting to discover how I can mangle a simple phrase by structuring it in Spanish. The reader may not know this, but English and Spanish work in opposite directions. Thus, a red car is a  carro rojo  (car red). Even worse, however, is the fact that Spanish allows for double and triple negatives:  no le digas nada a nadie  (don't tell no one nothing), whereas English frowns upon this.  Just as well. Excuses are easy to come up with, but it is hard to hide the fact that as a writer I still have a long way to go. Nevertheless, I might turn out to be good at scribbling. Who knows?  Sadly, however, not too many people get to make much money out of scribbling (ahem! Not that this is for money). Ah... Lets just call it a first step on the path to writing as a real writer or something and hope that this blog of mine amounts to something a bit more inspired than this--just let me finish that darned thesis first.  PS: One thing is for sure, though: I know a bit more about typing than the person that programmed this "Blogger" thing to place contiguous sentences just one space apart, rather than the two proper typing techniques call for.
