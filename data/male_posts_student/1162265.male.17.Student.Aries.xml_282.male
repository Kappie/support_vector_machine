I still haven't gotten even halfway through the class reading so all tommorow is that book.  Then what else.... saw Van Helsing with my dad.  I'm sooo out of it.  What junior spends their weekend with their dad?  Whatever, the movie sucked too.  That added to the badness factor.  Besides all that depressing stuff, I'm not dead.  So I can't exactly complain.
