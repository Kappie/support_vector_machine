I worked on CoGo's Sumatran Express, (you know the train at the zoo.........whatever.) Well lets just say when you have to keep riding and keep saying the speech it........ 1. Makes your mouth dry (Too Much Talking!) 2. The Gas Fumes Get to you (Thats why the title is Fumed Up!) 3. Sometimes you get hit with bugs ( EVEN IN THE EYE! ) 4. The microphone to say the speech dos'nt always work (But your Boss still makes you say it*) (But you still like your boss*)     I worked with Molly (mycousion) and Tracey (well shes just Tracey.) There alot od fun to work with but not when Trace has her Air Jordans on!!!!!! Tommorow I work on the Train again with Doneika ( I think thats How you spell it ) It's gonna be my last full day with her cause she is going to Italy to study abrod. Ill also be working with Alica B. shes cool to work with...but im gonna scare her and say theres a bug on her!!!     On Wednesday I finally get the day off, but i have HighSchool Orentation and Its Donekias last day so were trowing her a party at work. Well gotta go get some rest.                                                                                                                           Nite
