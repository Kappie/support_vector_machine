Most fathers want their sons and daughters to be    a doctor or a lawyer ,  well, mine wants me     to be a mechanic   .  GEE!!!!! How lucky i am.       He doesn't understand that everyone has a dream, and he can't just plan things for people - people = me-. "Everything bad thing has a good thing on it", and   i'm looking for the good   things on it ,  and i guess i've found some : he'll have to pay the italian course, and i'm -almost- that he'll have to give me some money when i ask him to!      I'm a bit sad!   It could be worse  , hummmmm... let me think in a way that it would be worse, way worse would make me happy... hummmmm.... he could want me to be a beggar. "Go boy, be a beggar, the trade of beggins is growwing".   It doesn't have sence  .               PS: nothing against the mechanics or the beggars and homelesses, it's just me.
