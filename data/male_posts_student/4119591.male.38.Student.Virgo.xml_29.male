According to this Associated Press  urlLink article , a city in Ohio was dismayed to find out that they could not tax the winnings of a local lottery-winning resident.   The news came at a bad time for South Euclid, which laid off six workers and made other cuts to help bring its $16.5 million budget down to $13 million, Welo said. The city had planned to use the windfall to rehire some workers and improve parks and recreation programs.  I think I finally understand how it works. It goes like this:   A city collects as much tax as it can possibly collect, creates bloated, ineffective public schools (specifically lacking the math education related to statistics and probability) which in turn brings thousands of new potential lottery players into the economy as they come of age. The hope for each city is that their respective constituents will be stupid enough to play and to do so often enough that one or more of them will win, entitling the city to a portion of the winnings in order to over-fund more crappy public schools.  Just because a theory is absurd doesn't make it wrong. ;-)
