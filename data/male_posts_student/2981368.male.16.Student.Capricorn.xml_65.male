Stats show that the Devils play better away than the Flyers do anyways, so this is the most balanced match-up you're gonna get. I'm just hoping its gonna be another matinee start (1pm EST) so we can actually listen to it without having to stay up till godknowswhen.   Bah.  Yesterday was about as much fun as getting an arrow through the neck, then discovering theres a gas bill attached to it. It rained. All. Fucking. Day. Me being me, decided to put off the dog walk until 'it stopped raining, or at least lightened a bit'. Of course, it just got heavier and heavier. In the end I just had to go for it, and got rewarded by getting absolutely drenched. As in, it would have been easier to jump into a swimming pool, then throw my shoes into a giant pile of mud/shit.  And today doesn't look great either. Its not actually raining right now, but it looks like it will, and I have to go clothes shopping. With my sister and her friends. *FATEWORSETHANDEATH* Again, It'd be more fun to get a second arrow through the neck, with an electricity bill attached. Or possibly to have to teach home economics at a german convent school outside hiedelburg. And yes, all of this is blatantly stolen from Blackadder.   *More bahs*  Nice to see Nat back, and I gotta run now, sounds like my sister + evil friends are trying to dismantle the ping pong table. arrrggghhhh  *blackadder quote of the day* Blackadder - "Ok, if you crawl over any barbed wire, you must on no account go AAAAAARRRGGHHHH!" Baldrick - "Did you just crawl over some barbed wire sir?" Blackadder - "No, Baldrick. I just dipped my elbow in a blob of ice cream."
