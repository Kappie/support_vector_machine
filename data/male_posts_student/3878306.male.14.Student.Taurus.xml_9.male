He's only six but damn I hope I wasn't that annoying when I was young I mean he's not that bad but sometimes I can't stand him. Anyway I love Ashlee Simpson there I said it. I'm buying her CD when it comes out July 20. I saw the show and man it's a great idea for promoting herself. I already have an idea of which songs she is going to make singles. First "Pieces Of Me" then "Shadow" and finally "Autobiography". We're going to this water park place today and tomorrow I'm going with Ivan and Sara to the mall or beach who knows. (But they are Beach freaks so..) Now that I think about it Duke did a hole bunch of songs for Freq games. He did about 10. That's about 10/55. (you do the math on the percent) Anyway I was thinking about Terrah. I think destiny showed me her and was thinking "Here Steven here's someone who doesn't like the same music as you doesn't have to many things in common but this is the person you will like" and man it worked. Destiny is grinning saying "There you go, you're likeable you don't need Jessica" and I agree. It was only about four days or so but I really liked her. (I mean I  really liked her)    We ended up going to the pool anyway. I was relaxed and got my swimming skills back (Somewhat) anyway later we went home took baths and got ready to go to Keysburg it's a fair like place. Me and my cousin Nicole rode all the good ones but she didn't want to ride the one in which you fly up and tit takes you back down really fast. Anyway by then she was sick. There was a arcade there and there were some really craze DDR (Dance Dance revolution)fans. I'm trying to say a gay guy with extensions a midget with a amazing DDR skill and a freaks tall guy with a funny laugh. I didn't play DDR I really want to but it's fine. I met this girl on the last ride I didn't want to ride by myself so I got to sit next to two girls. She told her friend on the way up the ride the second time. "I like him more than then the other guy we met" we were on the Power Ride and if was just a little loose you'd fly over. It was fun but it made me a little home sick. It reminded me of my friends. I wanted to be there with my friends. I imagined what my friends would say.  I'm in Ivan/sara's house now and we're going to the beach tomorrow.
