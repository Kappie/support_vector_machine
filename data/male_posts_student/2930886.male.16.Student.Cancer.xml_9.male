I'm going to update on everything that has been going on, well lets see, I'm going to go back as far as I can think.  Sunday, nothing I did nothing really interesting, a lot of homework and stuff like that, i finished the scouting report for track. It took me an hour or two, but hey, I realized that I am varsity, in Jav with 113'6" and in shot with 29'3". Relay for life was fun. I played ultimate frisbee with a bunch of people, shit that was fun, i think i should work on my throws so i can get better and get on a good college team. There was a lot of sitting around and talking, not bad actually lots of fun stuff. I went home at  11 and looked around for the key in my garage, but I couldnt find it, so i went back because my parents would flip a shit if i woke them. Well i spent the rest of the night, since Friday morning i have had less that 12 hours of sleep, in 87 hours I think. During the week i had a lot of homework, god forskaen stuff tests and what not, pissed off about that, my teachers are giving me a lot of work for the end of the year and i dont know what to write maybe if i had more time to write i would do better but hey track ends soon enough. Took bad but ill do hammer too so that should be fun and if no one else from bunnell does it I should have a school record.
