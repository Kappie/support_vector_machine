You always give me a headache, whenever its my time you try to take. Can you please stop coz I'm suffering.  You never listen to everything I say, that's why I didn't insist that you'd stay. Making comments about the madness that we've been through. You tried to ruin my life, and all along you thought it was right. So now I'm staying away from you!  Why can't I stand seeing you like this crying and screaming your apologies while I don't believe in any of these because you and your words are full of infidelities!!
