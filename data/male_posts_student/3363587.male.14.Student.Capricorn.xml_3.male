It's hurtin' me as much as them, trust me. Woohoo! BAND TOMORROW!!! Can't wait...The new songs roxorz...but there's just this one thing...I'M GOING TO CONDUCT ONE OF THEM!!! This shocking sh*t smacked me in the face when my the P man announced it during the last band practice...Yes, I should be confident, but the skill of conducting leaves a lot to be desired. Take me under your instruction, Kenrick!!! Teach me to be like you!!! Or...maybe not. Just teach me how to be a great conductor... =p Well, about the relationship thing...I've made up my mind...to completely give up on it. Truthfully, I don't really see any future with myself going on like a love blinded idiot. Why should I torture myself with this thing when I can use the lost time to make up for what I have now? Didn't really see things that way before last week...I was truly blinded by love. But rest assured I won't let this thing happen for a long long time. I WILL NOT! (For the time being). And kudos to Lisa Cheng for tearing off part of my shirt pocket. Oh how I longed for the beautiful satisfying sound of cotton and polyester ripping apart. The great moment. The hanging pocket. Excellent...First my pants pocket, now my SHIRT pocket...what next? I'll leave that up to her to decide...The great Punut Pincher...Don't blame me for calling her that. Hahaz...I just realized something...why waste my love on someone unworthy, when I waste it on other people? I love my family, my friends...(Yes, I do have a great love, yes, I do mean love, for all my friends. Some are bastards, some are bitches, but, yes, I do love them as friends.) Okay, that's enough...OWWWWWWWWCHHH!!! Gettin a cramp in my little finger! Gotta go! =D
