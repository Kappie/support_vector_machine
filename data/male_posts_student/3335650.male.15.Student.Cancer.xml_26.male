"u want i cricket (correct, but with emphasis on our game) my spillin of words ( go figure..) cos, loz, u don't see two meanins in holidaze??? r u a teachya? letts forge-it all the lessons that lessens us!!! Police release me, let me go...( do i hav to put in brackets 'joke' or can i not just make a choke?)most or'll of us want to hear about singin."  Erm... no i'm not a "teachya", just a school-kid with a knack for spelling... But that's beside the point. If the singing lesson's what you want to hear about, that's what I'll tell you :) So... at the moment in our singing lessons we're doing a song which is called "Pastime with Good Company", do a search on google and i'm sure you'll find it somewhere. It's by Henry the 8th and, despite our singing teachers repeated insistence to the contrary, it's incredibly dull. As a result, we have to find ourselves something else to do... so we thought, which is something our class is rarely guilty of doing, and came up with an excellent idea which only need 3 things: A willing volunteer (victim?), a chair, and some computer power cable. While my mates collected the necessary materials, I talked to the teacher about various singing-orientated subjects, like voice tests, note ranges and some stuff I didn't deem worthy of remembrance, to distract him, although it seemed quite unnecessary as he seemed to be engrossed in his own little world of note pitches and what-not. Once the required hardware had been found, it was a simple competition to see who could design and build the best restraint device... and let me tell you, some were, well, rather "original".  Then we found a plastic bag, cut holes in it, and used it as a hood. The teacher was still oblivious as to what was going on, if you can  possibly  believe that... Admittedly, there weren't any orange jumpsuits or guards with dogs, but there's nothing like snogging a vacuum cleaner for a torture method. I hope you appreciate the story, as I wrote the whole thing on my phone, and it took me forever ;-) Laters! Loz p.s. god only knows what Lou will be doing skating: She can barely stand on a deck, let alone 360Â° heelflip one!
