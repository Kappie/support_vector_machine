Before I tell you that I have to say how crazy it is that my eye doctor's name is Robin Du tt  and Robin's name is Robin Du nn ... Funny, ain't it?  So, My day, Robin and Robin's rockin'ness... I woke up nice and early to go volunteer at Special Olympics.... Aren't I just the nicest kid ever? I was home about 12:30. Had to clean my room and stuff. Round 5:30 I left for Dollar General to get a birthday card for the Robin' who has turned 16 monday and got her permit today... while in the store I heard the sad news of Formal Presiden's Regan's death due to Altimers... Sad news though I never knew the guy... I'd have to say the card was pretty good... on the fround was  "This year I went all out for you..." Inside "...I got you this card and an evenelope."  I added "and of cource some party" If that last part makes no sence to you... I feel sorry for you and the fact that you missed the DC Spy Museume and the awesome buss ride home... I also included a small envelope of "party" also part of the DC Trip awesomeness...  I proceeded to Robin's house to party with the rest of them... pretty good party, great people, great music (a lot of the Who and RHCP, and 93.7 the BUS), gread volleyball and pingpong games, and of cource great cake.... hehe droped all but a bite of my first piece... sorry Robin's Mom... Robin got some pretty great presents...  Well thats why Robin Rocks today, most other days she just rocks cause shes Robin... If you don't know her, then you should...  If you know Robin's favorite flower that would be pretty cool of you to tell me... Thats all I've got to say to you as of now so adios, chao, and goodbye...  -Dan V
