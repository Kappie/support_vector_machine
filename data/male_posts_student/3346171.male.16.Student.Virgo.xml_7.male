Everybody got bad grades so he said he's not going to corect our test and will give another one on nect fryday, thank God. And I had geography on second class, my geo teacher is so funny and trully smart, i've herad that he's the best geography teacher of the state. And i've found that Espírito Santo has lots of important things, like : the marble in my state is the oldest on Earth, it's 2,5 billion years old and the jerwels that the Queen Elizabeth wears are from here. Here in Brazil when they talk about ES, they say bad things only, but everybody knows that the State and Vitória are growing faslty.   I'm still sad. I think it's adolescent's thing. I feel alone, thinking that i have no friends and no one who cares about me :(:{  Hope this feeling to end as soon as possible.
