I WILLY DO MISS MY MANDA! And just so everybody knows, I've been a pure little boy while she was gone! I haven't even looked at girl without thinking, "I wish Amanda was here...", In fact, during CHURCH! argh... During church today, I was eating a chocolate bar that reminded me of tootsie rolls! AND THAT REMINDED ME OF AMANDA! AND THAT REMINDED ME OF DUCKIES! And that made me sad...  Anyways, I've been good today, sept for the missin Amanda part. Very hyper I was....
