During your school years people would call you names and pick on you, for reasons you didn’t know. One day a kid comes up to you and calls you gay. You think “wow maybe this is why I’ve had these feelings”. For the longest time you feel unhappy, depressed, and oh so very confused. But you decide that you like the gay people, the gay culture, it’s where you feel welcome. Imagine if one day, someone came and said, no this can’t go on any longer. The sadness came back, slowly, but surely. This... is my mother, it could be the ‘leaving the nest’ theory or that failing sense of control. But I do know this, my mum is keeping me from my friends that I love dearly.  On saturday night the most amazing thing happened, it was a huge realisation for me: We had all decided it was time for bed at about 3 am, we all just broke off into groups, each to their own: Gracie and Guck, Chris and Richard etc. Because I didn’t have any other options, I slept on the floor (well, a mattress really, but it was pretty close to the floor anyway). Turned out that this was where Rohan was also sleeping. We kind of just lay there for a while on our backs until I turned my back to him and he laid on his side. Shortly after I felt a hand resting on my body, I slowly reached across and, after stroking his hand for a short while, held it and brought it over my body, we were now very close. His movements seemed so soft and beautiful, I would clutch his hand tightly and he would respond with a gentle touch and he would stroke my fingers. Soon he was right up next to me, skin to skin, his front to my back, it was amazing. It seemed he shifted a little when I stroked his hand, as if to give me the signal that he was enjoying it. After an hour he turned over and I followed. I lay my hand softly on his hips, he gently picked up my hand and ran it across his chest, coming to an end at his nipple. The morning came, and it was all over,  during the night, not a word was spoken, and now, this remained true. I suppose I was nervous to say this before for fear of criticism and judgement, but I still wondered if I was gay or not, even when I had come out. There was always that sense of ‘what if’. This night with Rohan confirmed all that I had hoped, I like guys, and that’s a fact.  Sometimes I wish that I didn’t have  a family, my brother being homophobic, my mother being over protective. Right now I feel like just going to sleep and forgetting all of this, but sadly, the reality is that when I wake up, my life will still be the same, my mother will still be over protective, my brother homophobic. Sometimes I only bother becuase of my friends, and to find that meaning I’ve been searching for. Call me stupid, but I’m very short sighted when it comes to life.   “If people were able to learn from the experiences of others 100% fully, then most teenagers wouldn’t do many things that they do” Yvonne Woodward  In my oppinion parents should lighten up, their kids wont stay forever, no matter how hard they try, and ultimatly, they can’t tell their children what to do. Take for example this situation: Susi, your daughter wants to go to a party tonight at 10 pm. There will be alchahol and there is a good chance someone will get laid during the evening. You can a) stop her then she will creep out later on, or b) Say ok but give here some guidlines and suggestions, rather than rules.
