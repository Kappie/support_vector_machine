It was that essay that took me an hour and a half to finish. I think that it turned out well. My mom read it and she didn't have any corrections, but of course, she hasn't read the book. The book is so boring, but it has to be read.  Today Dominique stopped by and gave us ice cream. It was so cute! She won't read this for a while, so I am allowed to say what I want. Me getting to see her was the best part. I also talked with her on the phone. She cheered me right up. It was so awesome, she is a really cool person.   One day, I was kind of bored, so I decided to go online and play a game at  urlLink pogo . I just sort of hit a random place to go in, and it just happened to dump me in a forties or older room. I was yelled at in that room. People told me that I shouldn't be in there, since I was way younger (I was like 13 or 14 at the time, no wait, it was before high school, 11 or 12). One person actually said, it's ok that you are in here. I don't discriminate against age. Than later she said, I am going to ignore that kid, he is such a brat. I found one other person really close to my age. I am never going to forget that day. It has always bugged me, just because I was younger and I happened to click on a button that puts you in a random room, people decide it's a reason to get on your case. If anybody has ever wondered why I hate age discrimination, there ya have it.  Anyways, I have to go now. *NEWS FLASH* Two guys who happen to run a small gift shop with all sorts of odds and ends tried to kill a cow earlier with two ceramic angels. It was the first ever alleged "Knick Knack Paddy Whack". G'night everyone.
