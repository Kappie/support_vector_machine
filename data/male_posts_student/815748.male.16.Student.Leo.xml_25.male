Later we were talking about the origins of our last names and Mr. Vignone called on Justin again, saying, "Wow, McGonnagle must be an interesting name." Justin said, "Yeah, it must be, but my last name's McConchie." Everyone call Justin Jason McGonnagle!  In Physics, I gave Mr. Nocera a dollar for a lab thing, saying, "I got this dollar signed by the Secretary of the Treasury!" Mr. Nocera replied, "Wow! This must be worth, like, a dollar!"  In Math, Ann (last name?) proposed something in a proof, and Ms. Green said, "Does anyone know where Ann got that?" and I said "from the dark recesses of her mind!"  Loren was over yesterday, and we were taking notes on the textbook.  Here are some direct quotes: "Official statements by the pope were called bulls....The bull of 1296 was aimed at the French king Philip IV....This bull declared that there were two powers on earth....Philip merely sneered at this bull."  In English, we were in the Mac lab, and Loren pointed out a sample bibliographical citation on the white board.  The author's name was "Charles Mills Gayley."  I know, it's homophobic, but hilarious nonetheless!  I'll leave you with one final thought: "Shakawho?"
