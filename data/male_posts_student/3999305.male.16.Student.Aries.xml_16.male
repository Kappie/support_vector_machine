Got me soo hot.. =P and i bet you were too right? abt my day..well nothing much..Studied abit,not much only half an hour but it was just to refresh my memory on what im studying..It's a sleepy day for me..just lying down then study again( Pricipal must study and have lots of stamina,Right ;) ) Me and my student are sleepyheads and we got lots of stamina! Now just waiting to call my dear "student" as i must talk to her everyday or i can't go to slp..talking to her is the closest i can get besides being physically with her.so its very impt..also miss her thats why.. My heart lies besides her..its in her..she got it between her fingers in her grasp so tight that its almost impossible to remove..in fact its just impossible..! My dear,my "student",my sweetheart..basically my everything.. :) i just love her for who she really is..
