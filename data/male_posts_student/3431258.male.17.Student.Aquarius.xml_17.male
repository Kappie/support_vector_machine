Also tweaked a bit of stuff and discovered that there was a huge amount of Custom Templates on other websites. I'll have a look.   Played a bit of Duke Nukem 3D. I love this game.Also tried to do a custom map in NetStorm, but it crashes to desktop,wonder why. Also i entered the online server to play a bit, i found 3 persons on ring 13.2 of these persons were level 43 and a guy named meteor was level 1 (As me). So the two 43 level guys proposed a 1 vs. 1 between me and Meteor, The upper levels would give us advice. After some quick speaking and action, i proceeded to beat the crap out of meteor. As my golem putted his high priest on the altar, my priest started the ritual and his priest was sacrificed to the furies! Enough babling, i got friend with the master player who helped me.   I guess that's all, tomorow is Gincana and i will probably chat on X-Chat or have a talk with some friends... May as well re-install Warcraft III and duel.  Regards,  Zephyr
