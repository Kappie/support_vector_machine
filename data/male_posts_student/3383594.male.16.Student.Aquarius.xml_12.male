"People might think whatever they want about themselves, but wad others think of them might be different from wad they think." And that is actually wad I said to some today. Haha, words of Shawn The Great once again! Hehe, so I've finally find the time to create this blog thing. Why? Cus the mid-yr exams are nearly over! Yeah! It's a slack day for me today, although I still haf my a maths and combined science paper tomorrow, but well heck about a maths. As for combined science, it's juz MCQ and not short questions or essay questions. And I kindda studied for it already, so... Yea I'm free! Hehe, but I might consider to study for it later in the night or something. But den again, it's American Idol night! How can I possibly miss that show? So Hmmm, I guess I'll juz haf to prioritize. Today was pretty much a slack day too. Exams exams exams... *sigh* BORING! But it went pretty well (shockingly), English was pretty easy and as for as Food  Nutrition, I think I can pass. If I dun pass, I can go jump off the building man! Cus I know tt it wasn't too bad and I can't possibly fail. Why? Cus I think tt was the best FNN test that I've taken so far. Hehe, well, after the exams I went to eat at the hawker centre opposite of my school wif a couple of frens. We were basically slacking and talking nonsense, I didn't realli haf much to say though. I took a cab home wif the pussy cat, who was suppose to pay for the cab fee! But as u all noe, tt never happens, so poor me had to pay for the cab fee wif my limited amount of money. Stupid fat pussy cat! Hehe, well I guess tt's it, juz tryin this thing out so Yea, tt's bout' it! Oh yea, do me a favour by taggin my blog ya? Ok! Cya around~ =]
