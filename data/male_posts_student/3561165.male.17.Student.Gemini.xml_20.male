Yep, if you hadn't guessed by the topic (which you'd have to be pretty retarded, or rock-encompassed to not do so), I am celebrating the wizardry and nigh pant-wetting excitement of Greece's victory! Woo! Anyway, my life is slightly better, my computer is debunked of spyware, and it seems modestly likely I'll be painting with my Dad in America this time next week, or next two weeks. I think college is still on tomorrow, not utterly sure, but I'll go and hang out anyway, if there are no lessons I'll just return home for some "we talk, uKIP".  Anyway, this is a horribly short update, but I have very little to say, no ideological ramblings or musings, no band-related hyperbole or enthusings. I guess Wimbledon was interesting, and Maria Sharapvoa is the most beautiful thing since Lemon Sorbet. Take care people.   Mood: Happy, for Greece, bit bored and mundane else-wise.  Music: The Vines - Ride; Pink Floyd - Have a Cigar; Daft Punk - Aerodynamic; (and for Oli) Goldie Lookin' Chain - GLC Leisure Wear Quotation of the Day: “There are three things that I know a bit about in my life and that’s QPR, my guitar and drugs. I know QPR are the best football team in the world, my guitar is the most beautiful thing I own and that I don’t take enough drugs to kill me. It isn’t drugs that I need to get rid of; it’s the demons that fill my head. Once I have come to terms with my demons, maybe I’ll be able to get clean.”  ~ Pete Doherty
