So what’s new?  Hmm…  This quarter is winding down in college.  Finals are just a few short weeks away and then it’ll be summer vacation.  In reality, I’d like to continue going to school during the summer, but I can’t afford it and can’t get financial aid due to the fact that I already have an AA degree.  At least I’ll finally be transferring over to WSU in the fall and away from this stinking community college.  A buddy of mine was recently promoted to manager at a local Game Crazy, and a few weeks ago he offhandedly asked if I wanted a job there.  The hours at my current job have been sparse lately, so I thought what the heck and went ahead and filled out an app.  Well, a few days ago I dropped in and he asked if I’d come in for an “interview” on Monday, so it looks like I’ll be working part-time at a video game store.  Fitting considering the amount of time I spend playing and writing about them.  The only downer is that I’ll be making a mere $7.50 an hour or something like that, but at least I’ll get to take home new games and get free movie/game rentals at Hollywood Video.  My buddy will be the one “interviewing” me, so I could probably go in tomorrow wearing a tattered tee shirt, shorts and no shoes and still get the job.    I’m stoked about the upcoming release of  Thief: Deadly Shadows  for the Xbox.  I’ve never played a Thief game before, but from what I’ve read of them, they seem to be right up my alley.  I love games set in medieval/fantasy type eras and I equally love open-ended gameplay experiences.  Needless to say, I have it pre-ordered.  I’ll try and get a review up fairly quickly, so check www.thunderboltgames.com around next weekend if you want to hear my overall impressions.  I’ll be hitting the books pretty hard over the next two weeks, but I’ll update this more frequently throughout the summer, since I’ll have the free time to do so.  Ciao!
