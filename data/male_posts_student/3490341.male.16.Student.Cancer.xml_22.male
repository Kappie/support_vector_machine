In the future these photos will be recently taken ones but for the mo, I’ll stick with my favourites for you to enjoy.  So now back to the subject of today’s post: Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. This is the film that everyone has been seeing this week, and with good reason, and I’d like to see a ticket sale for a different film this week. This film is quite thoroughly amazing to those that are familiar with the books, which is everyone except a couple of Norwegian moles that slept through this best-selling craze because they were too tired (“Please can’t I have another 6 months in bed”) and hit the snooze button sometime in 1998, as well as to those that are not. This review will not cover the plot of the story, I’m sorry a deep sin of reviewing to leave out the synopsis, but hey, everyone knows the storry already (see Norwegian mole comment). I am a self-confessed super-fan of Harry potter and felt very good after seeing a film which was very magical in its picturesque hogwartsy way but I felt rather let down when I saw the second film. The first book had that very cosy fealling to it and so the style of Chris Columbus suited it very well but the second is a much darker film but that is not really shown in the film because the happy go lucky feeling of the school seemed to take away from the dark of the forbidden forest sequence and the final sequence with the basilisk-snake. This film is totally different, but as that very annoying child from the Macdonalds advert has been telling us: “Change is Good”. Alfonso Cuaron has brought to life the film and has changed it from what was seemed to be a children’s film into a film that appeals on different levels to different people: the principal that has made the Harry Potter books world wide best-sellers. I liked the feeling of the last films, ok they were aimed toward the smaller of us, please no short jokes I’m trying to make a point, but the ambience was very idyllic and when I heard that they had chosen a new director and that he was going to change the feeling of the films to a much darker setting I was rather apprehensive because I felt that if he went a bit over the top with the ‘darkness’ it wouldn’t feel like these films are in the same series. I can thankfully report that this is not the case and that the film flows with the new more introrespective feeling but keeps to the magic that is hogwarts, even accentuating it at times with the movement of the setting of Hagrids hut to Scotland for example. This film deserves the caption magical and I advise everyone, and I am not exaggerating, everyone to see it. NOW!
