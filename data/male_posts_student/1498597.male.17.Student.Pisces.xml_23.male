I wonder what everyone is up to right now...No one is online, which is pretty off puttin', but I'll continue to blog no matter what.  Last night (referring to Sunday night, since it is now past midnight) I watched a show about Hitler's rise to power.  It was kinda good, and I liked it.  I wonder if anyone watched it.  There I go wonderin' again.  You know, I haven't said any bad words in the past few blogs...thats gotta be a record for me, since I have one of the dirtiest mouths and minds in our little group.   Nick  has now begun the search for a "topic" for the blog, so I have a suggestion.  Why not just speak what is on your mind  Nick ?  You know, whatever is just on yer mind at the moment you happen to decide that you want to type a blog?  Its sounds like a good idea to me.  Not that the whole "life sucks" topic is bad, its just...remember in one of the editions of  The Punk Rock Editorial  how I said that "variety is the spice of life"?  Well by havin' random, unprepared topics on the blog that we could make this blog a lot more..."colorful" they might say...we can still have planned topics, but I kinda like the "expect the unexpected" sorta thing and it show that we live up to our blog's name, the  Three Eye Witnesses . I'll show you what I mean...A witness is someone who sees or experiences a random or spontaneous event (it can be a planned one too but for the sake of it...) and by bein' random and spontaneous, we can make the readers feel as if they are "witnessing" our lives and the things that happen in them with us.  Anyway, thats one of my ideas that I just had to get out there.  You know how I am with free speech and supportin' human rights.  Anyway, you can catch things like that and more at my individual blog,  The Punk Rock Editorial   (punkrockeditorial.blogspot.com) , though don't be surprised if I bring over topics from there to here.  The whole point of this blog, and maybe all blogs, is to express ideas, thoughts, and opinions and the event's that occur in one's life, and share them with the public, or more precisely, people who are willing to read about that shit.  I'm fuckin' runnin' outta things to talk about for now, and I havta do some homework I've been dreadin' for the past fuckin' weekend, so I'm bailin' for now.  See ya...
