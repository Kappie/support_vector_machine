This sucks, yes, but it's for the better....i want to get most of it done by this weekend.    I'm watching Old school right now, and shit....i should try and get into a frat or something.....but then i think about how most of the guys are all boy-toys, so i change my mind   BOLD   Well, mad peoples took there road test today, and passed....it's making me that much more ansy to take it myself.  I fell i got a hell of a chance, but i can;t let that get to my head.  I have a nice car waiting for me.......And shit, i spoke to my dad today, as to what car i can drive while he;'s away in ecuador for a week....apprently NONE cuase he dosn;t want me driving while he's not there.  Watching oldschool right now has also made me want to have more fun with freinds.  It's very sad that all new freinds made at antioch are most likely going to leave.  Really sucks.  Thats why i think we should all chill, you know, get more memories.  Plus, i think i should get drunk.....  so, i'm looking at my blog, and realize i have ALOT of shit to say....some not important or relavant at all, but i still have to say it, it's fucking nuts.  I think i have more entries than all of my immideate freinds entried  combined.  I also appparently have 1431 visits already.  It's crazy.      YOUR MY BOY BLUE!!!!!!!     bye bye
