I will begin screening my music collection for files I do not already own on CD, and I will start deleting them.  I will dispose of all DVD copies of movies that I possess.  And I'm going to begin deleting ISO files of any software I do not already own.  It is the proper thing to do, and I need to live consistently with my own values.    I should pay for that which I enjoy.  It's the only correct thing to do.  I'm serious about this.  It's time.
