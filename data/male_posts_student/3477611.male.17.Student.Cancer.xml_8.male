Where have the good days gone? Those without pain or travesty? Those moments of freedom gone. An image of me lingers on. That “me” of then  Wouldn’t have to deal with this now, Wouldn’t have to feel your death,  He might feel free,  But that’s not me… I’m bound by the burdens of reality!  I see you always. I will not forget! You will never be gone so long as I’ve still got one gasping breath to breathe You’re no longer bound by the burdens of reality.  Your face, it’s right under my skin. It haunts me, entirely…eternity next to you. The best nightmare I have ever known. A ghost to everyone, but not to me, You’re here to stay… No chance to flee, When I’m still bound by the burdens of reality.  I see you always. I will not forget! You will never be gone so long as I’ve still got one gasping breath to breathe You’re no longer bound by the burdens of reality.   This burden of your bearing. It rips me from faith and belief. Your end is a fleeting misery. It tares and ravages. It parted you from me. But it can never take you, entirely, from me! These burdens won’t be reality!  I will constantly be thinking: Never hide away! Never go away! So I guess you will always be there. What an unusual beginning… To such a saddening story    here ends the love making session
