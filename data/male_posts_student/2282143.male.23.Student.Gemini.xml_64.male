And if so...if so...who answers...who answers...?" ~Pearl Jam, Alive  So today wasnt that bad.  I feel better but not complete on my issues that I have.  But the Zoo was fun.  Worked a wedding that took place during the day.  Weddings at the zoo are funny to me because I dont see how a zoo would be a good place for one, but we have good food and put on a hell of a party, so its cool.  Dont want mine there, unless my fiancee really thought it was a good idea.  I dunno.  Saw my buddy Maggie that wasnt there last year, but did end up coming back (all because of me she says, but she was just kidding... made my day though).  Sue was there and she is so cynical its hysterical.  Tom N. was here today too, and he is funny in what I call the "Tony Tatina" funny.  He doesnt really talk too much out of conversation, but when he jumps in, its usually pretty damn funny.  So since my buds was back, a few of us went out for a beer at an Irish pub like place right off Harlem called James Joyce.  It was fun.  We just relaxed, caught up with each other, and had a good old motor safari time.  Was good to see old friends again today.  Especially since the weekend was so busy.  Work was busy, my mind was busy, my body was busy.  I can only see myself as emotionally and physically drained from this week and weekend.  On a side note, I have a nice sunburn and some color.  I think my body was craving the vitamin D.  So much time indoors and finally some release, to be outside and to be happy to be there.  I also cant wait for next weekend.  Sam comes home and I get to spend some time with her.  Im really looking forward to just being with her.  So much I miss and so much to talk about.  I need this week to recover.  Get my thoughts in line and be myself for a bit...  However I do think I have already made a huge decision about my future...  More to come later as this develops (dont worry, this is a good thing!)
