Today was a fun day, I went to bed at 3:45 this morning, and woke up at about 1 this afternoon, after I woke up I wandered around like a zombie for a little bit, then was chartered by my parents to take my little sister to the house of her best friend, who lives pretty far away, in a house that is so huge you need a house speaker system to communicate with each other, this house was more wired than me after chugging a pot of coffee after a chocolate eating competition.  After that I went home and got ready for work, worked for 3 hours, made 25 bucks, and went home to have another boring night, instead my night turned out awesome.  The Night:  It started around 9, my good friend Saysan called me and wanted to know if I could pick her and her awesome friend Kelsey up from the mall, I obliged and went on my way to get them.  After I picked them up, we decided to go back to Saysan's house for a little bit to figure out what to do for the rest of the night. At about this time my good buddy Maher called, (him and Jennifer are back at I think, which is good, he was depressed)he said he was going over to my house to swim in my pool with my Kenyan brother Marsh and Jennifer, I told them I would be at my house in half an hour. Saysan, Kelsey and I decided to go to McDonald's to get some food and figure out what to do after my house. We go to my house and just sit around for a little bit, there were some awkward moments, I mentioned skinny dipping, but it was a little to cold, and our sauna wasn't burning so it was a no go.  So with the Saysan and the Kelsey who were supposed to "go home" we kind of ditched Maher and the crew  (sorry about that), and went back to her house, while the M-dog and his posse stayed at my house, without me there.  Back at Saysans house we got the idea to go to IHOP (I love thee IHOP), so they changed and got ready, then we decided to straighten my hair, which got crazy!...and I told Saysan I would let her give me a makeover sometime soon, (she wants to dye my hair blonde!) then we set off for IHOP, and planned on meeting the Maher crew there.  At IHOP we ran into some friends who were stoned and drunk, they were pretty funny, of course its only funny when you arent stoned or drunk, even when you want to be but there wasnt anything left.  We got our food and talked then I dropped off Saysan and Kelsey at home and came here......  it was much more fun than it sounds on the glowing screen in front of you, believe me....but what did I say about making my posts less exciting...   To Maher: I'm sorry about ditching you twice tonight, but I had fun and that's what matters.   Latest news:  I am getting my hair trimmed tomorrow, wish me luck, I doubt it will go down without a fight.   Tomorrow night, after work, that great Russian comedian from Branson is coming up, yes I'm talking about Yakov, he is coming to party with a bunch of my parent's Russian friends, this phenomenon is also known as an alcohol fest, when you get this many crazy Russians together, vodka quickly replaces the water in the body of most and great times ensue.  This is awesome, I will get to meet Yakov, drink with Yakov, tell jokes with Yakov, possibly have sex with Yakov (I'm just kidding don't take me seriously), and then when all the Russians are totally trashed, make off with about 12 bottles of vodka, which they wont notice missing...    The zebra moth disappeared tonight, I fear it is dead.  Starting next Monday I have no hours for that entire week, those god damn ass-clowns are starting to piss me off with the lack of hours.  George W. Bush is a fucking moron  My check engine light came on tonight, not good news considering I have a road trip next weekend.  (Thank you Jon, your car is a piece!)    I love you all, peace, Sprint
