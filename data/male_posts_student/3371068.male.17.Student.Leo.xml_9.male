I tried to get a hold of Chelsea to go but I only had her old cell number ( and she has no home phone). So we went to the movies only to find that the movie we were going to see wasn't in. That sucked so we wandered around for a few hours. Saturday morning, Chelsea calls me and bitches me out for not going to her house and grabbing her despite the fact that I tried to call her and we were in a rush to go to the early show and couldn't make a detour. After making me feel like a piece of shit for a while she proceeds to tell me that she wants to do something on Sunday. Ok. Im good for that. That night I went to my friends house in Bowmanville and got plastered as well as saw Chronicles of Riddick.Good fucking movie. Sunday rolls around and Chelsea said she would call Matts at 11 because she was at her sisters house (?). She doesn't call so Matt myself and lil' Amanda hang out all day. You can bet im gonna get bitched out over this event though it's not my fault. Im gonna just stop giving a shit. She isn't my girlfriend anymore and as mean as it sounds, I dont have to answer to her anymore.    I can see you but you cant see me. I could touch you and you couldn't even feel me.
