Awesome is a word I try not to use too often, because to me that word is reserved for something from God. But it is the only word that could describe the way I experienced God over that weekend.  As I have mentioned previously, my wife and I separated at the end of last year, and it appears unlikely that there will be any reconciliation. For a long time I have been down about this, especially as the end of my marriage also meant the end of other aspects of my life. I had to give up my position on the leadership of my church, and people have been reluctant to use me in other areas of ministry. In most cases this has been more out of not wishing to overload me, but some people I think have not wanted me involved because of the impression it would give. Certainly this was the case with my leadership role.  I was concerned that my involvement with youth ministry was going to be at an end. I hadn't been able to lead a small group for some time, because of my work hours, and now that my work situation meant I had the time, my personal circumstances seemed to exclude me.  I felt like God was not going to be able to use me anymore, that my usefulness was at an end.  Another concern I had was that I had lost a lot of my trust in others. I used to give people the benefit of the doubt, people would have my trust unless they showed that they didn't deserve it. Now, I don't trust people until they earn it. In a lot of ways I have found my heart has hardened, and it wasn't something I liked.  At Easter Camp one of the speakers was a youth pastor whose wife had had an affair, resulting in divorce. This guy went through the same issues I had been dealing with, feeling that his ministry was over, that his usefulness to God was at an end, and at one point even felt as though he wished his life was over. As he was speaking, I was amazed. It was as though he was outlining my life, going through all the things I was feeling. It was as though God was using him to talk directly to me. He went on to explain that God still has a Plan A for my life, that He is still able to use me.   He also talked about faith, about how your faith when times get tough is more important in God's eyes than your successes or failures. Listening to this started me thinking, and opened my eyes. And this was only the first day of the camp! How much more was God going to challenge me?
