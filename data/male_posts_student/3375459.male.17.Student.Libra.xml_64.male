I wonder if death in love is a typical Korean movie ending, it really is a story about the love of our live. Some were some how, some one could have been having a crush on you, even holding onto that though of ending up together silently without you even knowing. It is a nice thought to hold on to, I wonder… Nah, who would have a crush on me man? I’m just a boring, cheapskate, lazy crap who only loves to sketch. Should I touch a little on my crush? YOU WISH!! HAhahhahaa!! Its only for her to know one day, one fine day went she’s ready know.  *Note: by then, it might already be too late*  Well, I don’t know. Maybe I’ll just hold onto the thought and continue with our separate lives until time itself. Yes, time which everything, everyone have to pass through. I shall mark a spot on time, no matter what the ending, that day will come.  Hey, for now I should bury myself back into studies man and get a good job afterwards. I mean, which girl would want to go out with a guy without a secured job? Am I not right to say that? I’m not saying all girls are after rich guys with high post, but I’m sure all of them want to find a sense of security in their man won’t they? Aiya, crap, must be the movie’s doing. Anyway, I don’t have time to analyze this, post your comments ok? Time to get my head banging into concrete, HEhee…
