Then you realize that you are at work, and you are pushing carts for $5.50. You notice the plastic bags in the cart are like a yellow haven for heat. The customer is being a bitch and you have to put up with it. So you push the cart to the car and unload the packages.The guy looks atand ...........and...and, he says thanks and tips you 3 bucks. Wow life kicks ass.................... then you walk back in and as you start to work you just think about what to do with the green cash. Thongs, Cars, Overpriced Digital Clocks, or a Supra MK3.The thought of cash makesyou think of all the free stuff that you have gotten thru out yourlife.................for me it has been an American Airlines Headphone set that is madfrom Styrofoam. (Cheap ShitSuxs, reality is acold pill named "Bitch")    P.S. Being a Cashier is the easiest  job ever, just stand there and  push buttons.
