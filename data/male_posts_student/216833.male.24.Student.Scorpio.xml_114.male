       
      So I am all situated in the livingroom of Alex and Eric's apartment. Things are going ok. I am just looking for jobs like mad, trying to get this school mess done with and hopefully find a job in California. I really want to get out there with MiMi. I am starting to miss her terrible. Esp. since I feel like the odd man now. Alex and Eric are all chilling with their ladies and I am alone with a cat and ferret. :) It's cool. It's only for a short amount of time. I am going to go to a show at Nick's house tonight and yell profanity and take a poop in his yard. Should be a mess of fun.  Things are going well, I am really itching to get back to school - hopefully this next spring 2003 I can enroll and start with that mess.  Peace   current mood: accomplished current music: promise ring - wood water
