Btw its 6 47 now .. and .. forget that clock under my post .. doesnt work .. hmm .. or maybe it does .. its set wrongly .. maybe .. :P .. hmm .. aah w/e the truth is i dont know how its set.  Aah so .. where were we .. hmm .. all happening .. yeah .. Actually .. its so much that it feels like i am on a fast train, or mebbe I am a fast train and i dont know when will the tracks stop..  I have a few bleak conceptions, like ok .. I have to do this .. THEN .. and that THEN .. but when .. will this speed ride stop .. or .. crash (hopefully not :P) .. I dont know! ... DAMN YOU SPIDERMAN .. come save me .. :P.... hmm .. wait a sec .. IAM SPIDERMAN .. damn .. life can play tricks on you .. :P  I like staying busy, and well I know I am gaining alot of experience points here.If the opportunity is good and legal .. grab hold I say, and well thats what i am doing now days, prolly thats the reason i am so stuffed all the time (not with food god damn it! .. with work ... and ... hmm play sometimes .. :P)   Any ways ... All i know is that i needrest .. and for some of the people who know what i am into .. will know why as well. But then, if i pause for rest .. i feel so bored .. coz there is nothing to rest onto ..andin the end i end up bored. So much for rest.  Stoopid CS still doesnt go on low ping! I am kicked out all the time, with a very nice polite message, Sorry your ping is too high please try agan later. And in that sweet sorry i can see a smile/grin of some terrible idiot who thinks its so UBER COOL to kick me out .. grrrrr... 238 - 300 latency .. I mean comon .. mein nay kya gunah kiya hai .. AllI wanted to be was a terrorist .. (ALL PUNS INTENDED :P)  And now out of the blue the PC starts functioning like a Donkey with ME sitting on it! ..Moreover, yesterday the net wasnt working .. proper .. and i had some real important assignments to send .. and ... well i was so pissed .. I slammed my mouse 2times .. and now i feel sad .. Myintel 3.0 ... the one i bought from MY OWNMONEY!!(ok yeah .. it was second hand .. SO WHAT .. :P .. ?)  Anyways, Ifeel so lazy ... and .. HEAVY( yeah .. VERY HEAVY .. :P) and i dont wanna do anything, but then idont wanna be bored .. so i do something .. :P Oh man i am totally not making sense here .. Sorryto all you folks .. who have taken my nuisance .. and thank you as well .. In the end .. Alls cool . (I hope so) ..  K den .. bouncin Ma3salam LuDa
