Although I hate to admit it, I like almost exactly the same music she does. Well, actually, I like almost everything, which is probably why I like the same as her. But a lot of stuff she listens to are my favorites. Her laugh. The sound of it, the way it feels when I have my head on her chest or belly. It vibrates my head funny. I love it. The way she kisses. Soft, slow, then all of a sudden right there. Tingles in my stomach. The way the things I don't like about her make me like her more. Late nights. Early mornings. Sleeping in. Watching TV. Going out. These are just a few of the things I love about her.  urlLink  postCount('loveabouther');
