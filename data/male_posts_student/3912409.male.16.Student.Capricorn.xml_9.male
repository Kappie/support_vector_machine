We also had a new kid join the club today and he says that he has only been playing for three days, if thats true then he is really good. I think that he is as good if not better then Wes, who has been playing for maybe three months now, and when I told Wes that he got mad at me :'(... lol but meh.    Apparently a couple days ago the forecast for this weekends weather was supposed to be 35°C and then yesterday they changed that to 37°C and now there is a heat stroke warning for this weekend. So thats really not going to be fun playing a tennis tournament with a heat stroke warning. BUT.... that means that we get to stay inide the club house and watch the TV!... but it doesn't get any channels.... it only has a black screen with the top half all purple (YAY! fun).    I still have my S-cry-ed Vol. 2 DVD to watch, I guess the main reason that I haven't watched it yet is because I don't have my DVD player set up to my new tv yet. It's not really hard to do.... in fact it will probably only take a minute, but then again..... it's still work. I guess since I'm talking about anime I'll just say that I finished watching Naruto episode 92 a couple minutes ago, and it was good but I think the next one will be better. O yeah, I have to either go fix my downstairs computer which has the DVD burner on it so I can burn all of my anime on my computer to DVDs or else I have to start deleting a bunch soon. I have 35 gigs of anime  and I'm getting low on gigs left on my computer... well not really, 'cause I have more then 20 gigs left, but it still seems low to me :p
