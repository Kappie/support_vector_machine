I could go through and delete it, but I've changed my mind real quick like and decided to just post this now.  I've heard about how good  urlLink Blogger  was, but I never actually got into blogs until a month ago. Blogger wasn't reintroduced to me until today. Before that I'd been using  urlLink tBLOG  and I still don't know which one to go with. I love the templates on Blogger that they offer, but there is that ad at the top. And does it have all the same cool stuff?  Anyway, I heard about the new design on Blogger and decided to check it out. Now I'm thinking that the ad at the top really might not be too bad. I mean, it is free and I get all these cool things. Where as with tBLOG I'd have to pay to get templates, and the pre-made ones aren't (of course) as good as these. I doubt I'm very good at making templates anywhoo.  Well, I think I've pretty much typed enough for today. If you want to see all my old posts on my tBLOG account,  urlLink go here . I might just copy them all over tommorow so I can catch all you people up on everything that's happened. Anyway, toodles, and have a great day.
