But to have something that is so awesome that it consumes you taken away are teared down is the most horrible feeling in the world. It's not that it makes you feel bad (which it does), it's that it leaves you with the most aweful emptiness that is extremely hard to fill. You can say, well he's only a teen, what does he know what love is. If you say this, then I probably have a better idea of what it is than you do. Love is a gift and expression that you share with someone. Just talking and sharing your spirit with them is one of the most powerful things of love. Suprised? Well I feel alone among other teens for they don't know what it is, only adding to the emptiness. I try to mask it up and be happy so in turn everyone else is. But alas, this only addeds to the emptiness and leads everyone else to follow in their own happy worlds. I done with mask. I will act how I feel.
