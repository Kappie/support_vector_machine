I fell down like a hundred times and of course the kids laughed and made fun of me. Regardless, I loved being with them and seeing them smile for the whole time. I think they finally had a chance to be kids; away from the pollution and psyhological pain of home and the city. I fall in love with them in different ways every single day....  2. I was reading Anon 1's post and I just wanted to make a comment on the trivial moments and things of life. I do not think think there is much in life that is trivial, whether it is washing dishes, cleaning the toilet, or the shoes a person wears. I think these things add up to make the world a better place. It is just that people like me have been consumed in our rage and anger at the bad things in the world and that drives us to almost insane limits to change things. I think in our firey passions we burn the very roses and dreams that we want to build in a better society. That is why I think it is the people who remembered the trivial things that will be critical in reconstructing a better world after the "Big R" (revolution)... hehe  It will be there sense of humanity, laughter, and tears that will be the foundations of a better society. I believe that with all my heart. I know a lot of revolutionaries would laugh at me for believing such a thing, but I do not want to live in a cold world where it is too trivial to laugh to silly jokes and silly bloopers. Those things are what I fight for every single day... And it is those things that I try so very hard to make time for. It especially becomes important when dealing with family. I know in the past I did not treat my grandma good. Everything was too important except for her, but now I try always always to smile and listen and be patient when she needs a few more minutes and I revel in joy in those moments when I can be in wonder at how life proceeds.... so let us not discard the trivial things... in life...  lol :)
