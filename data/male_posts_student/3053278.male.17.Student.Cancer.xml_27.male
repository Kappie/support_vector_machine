Problem is that is also my great uncles 80th birthday. I hope the tournament is going according to schedule so I can leave in time for the party.  My second thing is getting other people out there at lilov. The prom excuse won't work this time so hopefully everyone will be ready to compete on Saturday. I know Idris can't make it but hopefully I'll get Mer out there on the sabre side. I really want the boy's foil and epee squad to compete. They need it. I need to do something with Sam. I feel like I owe him some type of training. I also need to send letters out to the boys team to advertise the club. The summer is less important to me but the truth is that in the Fall, I won't take no for an answer.
