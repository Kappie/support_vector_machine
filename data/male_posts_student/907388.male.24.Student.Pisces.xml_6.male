Who are Anne and Jisnu ? Well they were my batch mates in engineering college. They were one of the numerous "COUPLES" which wre formed within the first few months. But the important thing is that ... while many of these broke apart within the next few months, these twoo people are going to get married early next year. Now that's what makes them special as far as i am concerned. I meet them in order to convince myself that Love does exist.. ... it really is upto us to find it. Sometimes it happens that we meet sombody whom we assume to be our true love, but later it doesn't turn out that way. In such times we tend to believe that there is no such thing as true love. But it is not so. It does exist. Just bcause we met the wrong person who did not deserve to be our partner, it doesn't mean that love doesn't exist. It just means that we have to look harder to find it. I hope that all of you find your true love wherever you are. And I pray to the Lord that I may too do so.  Fall all those who believe in love, I have started a new Yahoo group caled Have Faith in Love. Please join the group and spread the message.
