I got dropped off near the mall and just was going to walk up to work, but I had a bunch of time to kill, so I stopped at Wegman's, got some donuts and a milk chug and was going to go up to Panera's to just sit down and waste time..so I get up to Panera's, put my skateboard in the booth along with my work stuff and food and goto the bathroom to wash-up. I come back, sit down and open up my milk and..then Eva Braun comes to my table and tells me, "I'm sorry, you can't sit here and eat food, unless you buy it from here." Uh..good one lady. I just wanted to say, "Hey Eva, there are about 10 people in here, including your [hot] employees, so it's not like I'm taking anyone's booth." Gesh..people are so lame. I should've gone up to the register and just asked for the cheapest thing, or else just told the lady I was going to eat my donuts and drink my milk, and then buy a sandwhich for lunch, then just..left. Oh well, I just got to work REALLY early and just sat outside and ate because the doors were locked. Eh.  So, work was super busy...or not. After 6 hours of work, I sold only 11 drinks. ELEVEN. It was weak, I barely had any customers, I almost went crazy. But I just made stuff and bounced some bouncy balls around. Anyways, I'm bored, tired and...want to sleep, so I'll go.  Er. Yeah.
