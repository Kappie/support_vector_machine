LMAO. when you go to the site you can see the lil miss *** and lil mr *** people all over the place. -___-;; i've also signed up for a photo hosting thingo so we'll have photos galore on this site in the very near future. i was trying to do my  hyperbola  homework too...failing miserably...the hyperbola's are so hard to draw! *yes i am unskilled aDr0~* far out...now i am trying to do my english feature article and find a topic to do for my japanese research.  sugimoto  restricted to being within tokyo which is really annoying since there is nothing, that i can find, which operates in tokyo and is interesting. so yeah...what should the shortened url of this blog be? hmm...now i should go to sleep ---  athletics carnival  tomorrow...need my rest to beat lanky ^__^ goodluck to  ipt people ...you should all quit. and as a last word, if you plan on choosing latin as a subject...be warned, there are serious  repercussions  >.
