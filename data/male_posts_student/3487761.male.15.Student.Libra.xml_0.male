Im a secondary school student in studying Singapore.Its my pleasure to start my own websiteand I wish that I would be able to continue writing here as long as I live ( provided that I do no forget about you).    Anyway, Im a skinny male with a height of about 1.8 metres. Wooooo..... quite tall isnt it? However, this had caused me to be terribly underweight (so sad), leaving my report book with an sarcarstic comment, " Need to refer to doctors for advices". Crap!    Before I stop typing, I wished that I could score an A1 for the coming O' level Mother tongue.    See ya...
