From now on we celebrate not my birth but the making of a movie that catwoman fans everywhere hate with a passion that consumes them. It's raining outside today, as it does on all of my birthdays as far back as I can remember. Which is good because I love the rain. It's mother natures little birthday present to me.    "I was on this planetrip this one time when the captain comes on the intercom. He goes through all the technical mumbo jumbo, we'll be flying at 35000 feet, shit like that. Anyway, he sets down the little speaker thingy but forgets to turn it off.He turns to the co-pilot and says; "All I need right now is a blowjob and a cup of coffee." Just like that. The flight attendent goes wide eyed and runs to the front ofthe plane to tell the captain he left the mike on. Some wiseass in the back of the plane yells after her "Don't forget the coffee"."
