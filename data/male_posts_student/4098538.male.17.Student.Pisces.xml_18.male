Went to the pub with some friends on Wednesday. Puked on the bus home because I didn't eat that day. Went to Jilly's on Thursday night with Mandy, Adam and his new girlfriend Kelli. Thatwas fun/confusing (at times) because she was tripping on LSD. Mandy come back to mine and stayed untilyesterday morning. Seeing as she had the house to herselflast night I thought I should take advantage of it so I went round when she finished work and stayed over. T'was ace! I love spending time with her.
