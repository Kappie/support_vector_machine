The date they come to my area isn't till August, but I'm already getting psyched, and I ended up abandoning all other bands I listen to for the sake of learning the lyrics to every Rush song I can get my slender fingers on. I can't wait!  Things are picking up again, really this time. I dunno why, it's probably some kind of astral thing I'm not seeing. Well, as long as things keep turning good for me and the other people who don't suck, it's gonna be ill. I still can't wait for the end of the school year too, so I can stop being a lazy bastard, in most ways.   I've been doing alot of unnecessary thinking too, not so much about chicks as I used to, sheez they plagued my mind. Thank god it's over. Now, it's just more about trying to fit the most amount of possible things to do in the tiny amount of time I'm home from school every weekday, and managing that time so after this year, I'll be able to do it next year. Especially since Aqua Teen Hunger Force keeps me up laughing at night, and I end up sleeping in school, and at the computer desk.  Anyways, Mike out.    ......I'm takin you to court. You know who you are. *Evil snicker*
