First off, it's important to note that I have virtually no interest in any of the other NFL teams and watching any other NFL game besides one involving Dallas usually bores me to tears. The Cowboys are one of the few Texas ways of life that I have adopted in my 19 years here. But back to Quincy. I've always thought he had great potential and could end up being a good QB for the Cowboys, so I was really looking forward to watching him play this year. It turns out, according to television reports, that he tested positive for cocaine. When I heard drugs, I assumed roids or weed, but looking at him and seeing that he was pretty skinny I decided it had to be weed. But cocaine? While it sucks that he was doing that drug, it surely explains a whole lot and points to a bright future for him! I mean seriously, think about it. He was so damned erratic out there. One time he'd throw a great rope to a WR on an out route, but the next time he'd attempt to pass the ball and it would literally fall behind him. He was on and off...almost like a person who uses coke a lot! Perhaps he was like DH from  Playmakers  and constantly had to get his fix before the game. If he can really rehab and get off the stuff, he might be really good in the future! Too bad stuffy old Bill Parcells cuts someone if they are a minute late to practice...I mean come on, it's JUST cocaine! That's enough sports talk for now.  I saw  The Village  last night. I figured out the plot halfway through, but while watching it I enjoyed it a great deal. Then, I got home, and began to think about the movie. I realized that I was duped partially by great camera work, I think. While the movie is shot in a way that is quite pleasing, the premise, as Roger Ebert expounded in his review, is laughable. Even before I went to bed I was still thinking about the movie, and thinking that I liked it. I woke up at 5 a.m. in a cold sweat, and the first thing that came to my mind was "that movie sucked." I still can't completely explain how I was manipulated into thinking it was a good movie while I watched it, but I was. M. Night needs to do better than this next time.  I think he's a director who is still living off the fact that he made one really good movie.  I just started working out again for the first time in 3 weeks, and man is it painful. I've got to stop getting out of shape. The prospect of being on a beach in two weeks has made me workout again. Fortunately, I assume that the only people in Destin in two weeks will be old people, thus minimizing embarrassment. On the brightside, working out at home I don't have to deal with the various douchebags that populate the gym at school. Unfortunately, I also don't get to see hot girls. Oh, well.  Well, back to working on my lit review that's due next week. Only 18 of 18 pages to go!  Peace out! Alex  P.S. I'll try to blog more.
