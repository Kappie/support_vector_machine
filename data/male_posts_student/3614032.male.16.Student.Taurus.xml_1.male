People are dyeing, sick, fucking sheep and all I can do is live and never help. Im 16, and Im 83...I'm stuck in a poor family where we blame each other for our problems, so I go to my friends house, Where I can look but not touch his and his families problems. Look but dont touch...look but dont FUCKING TOUCH!!!!!!! I only had ONE saving grace, ONE person to find happyness in, ONE person who cared to pick up the phone and call me when I was popping the sleepy time pills. Now she's gone. After two years of my shit she packed up and left. And I'm alone in my head. Shes not coming back, she's to far gone. She is now out of my reach, and no matter how hard I try, I can only stretch my arm so far. Alone. I have friends that I can see, that I can hear, but I cant touch them. I know they try to care, but they have their own stress to deal with. I can feel the howlers, they are comming for me now, but I wont go down without a fight. Something will die.
