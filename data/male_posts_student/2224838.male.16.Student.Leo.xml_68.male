For some reason the page divison is not exactly working.  I also don't know how to make the sidebar division span the entire length of the page. But I am just a simple fool. If anyone knows how to fix these minor errors, please give me a holla.  Now that I'm actually set on a layout, I need to get back to posting stuff...
