I don't see why anyone would want to use pop3 to get their Gmail mail, seeing how incredibly awesome the webmail GUI is. Nonetheless, there's still a good use for it.  You can use it in conjunction with a "new email notifier", or include it in a  urlLink Samurize  config  (which is what I intend on doing).
