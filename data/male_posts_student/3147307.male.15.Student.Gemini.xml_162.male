It is called the  urlLink Hilly Hundred  and it is a 50 mile a day weekend bike trip in the hills of southern Indiana. The hills are steeper than most in the Rocky Mountains - they are just not quite so tall. Our ride to Michigan was very, very flat in comparison. I've been down there twice for the ride, but have never actually done it. It's kinda a Hart thing to go down there. At least one, and up to 15 Harts have been down there every year for 30 years. One interesting story (i'm bored by the way) from the Hilly in '98 (I was down there), Dad had just finished, and as he was walking away he was the only witness to see someone back their car over a cyclist who was laying down. The cyclist was severly injured and sued CIBA - 2 years later Dad got a phone call and had to go to court as a witness for the case. anyways thats the ride Im doing next. Anyone else wanna do it? Cross country practice officialy started today - we ran a 1-mile warmup, a 2-mile sprint, and then a 1-mile cool down. Today was the day we heard the speech from coach (no drinking, drugs, mooning others while running, etc.) - very boring.   urlLink Meant to Live - Switchfoot  - this is a rare exception, I generally don't like Switchfoot at all, and the song is stuck in my head thus becoming the song of the day.  "It's not me who can't keep a secret, it's the people I tell that can't." - Abraham Lincoln  "Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow." - Genesis 41:2
