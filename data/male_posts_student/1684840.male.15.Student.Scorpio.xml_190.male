I woke up around 8am by the bloody noisy phone by the bed (Grandad phoned us from his room to wake us up for the hotel's early breakfast times!) The hotel breakfast was really nice and you could help yourself to a large selection of cereal and hot food. In total I had a full english breakfast minus the egg, a bowl of Cruncy Nut Cornflakes (ludicrously tasty) and three glasses of apple juice.  Not long after we set off out into the mega-city that is London. Grandad got us a couple of bus passes each for today and tomorrow and then we walked with Grandma to the Edexcel head office so she could do her work. Me, Dan, Ryan and Grandad then found the nearest bus stop to take us to the Tower of London. The bus journey was about 10 to 15 minutes in total, taking us past St. Pauls Cathedral and a few buildings which stand out on the London skyline, such as the 'egg' building (the Swiss Gerkin) and the Natwest Tower. Nice messages on the bus such as "Treat all abandoned baggage with suspicion, GUILTY UNTIL PROOVEN INNOCENT" (risk they might contain wild gerbils on canabis, or a bomb or something)  The Tower of London was quite good. We got to see the large ravens prowling around in and around their cages on the grass inside the fortress. In the white tower where the Kings and Queens were help prisoner, there were lots of exhibitions of the armour used in battle and models of the whole tower etc. We then saw the crown jewels which were absolutely amazing. They were so sparkly and very, very beautiful. We had to go through a secure vault door to get to them. We departed the tower shortly after this in search of a drink or ice-cream as Ryan wanted. Standing behind us mightily was the great Tower Bridge.  We went up and around the Tower Bridge taking tons of photos and admiring the spectacular views from the walkway above the road bit, then watched a couple of short movies about how the tower was built and how it worked etc. Afterwards we saw the old pumping and engines for it which lifted it when a large boat sailed along the Thames. After having an ice-cream, we went across the bridge again and boarded another bus all the way through Westminster and into the West End. I have never seen so many people or shops in my life! God this place was busy. I snapped a couple of pictures from the bus frantically as we passed because there was no way we were going to stop here! We went passed Piccadilly Circus with its giant lights and signs and past Soho.  We took the bus near to Buckingham Palace and then got off for a short walk around the Queen's back garden because no buses could go down to the palace itself. We arrived to find another large crowd perched around the Queen Victoria monument like pigeons with dead legs. The palace was quite cool, Big Ben and the London Eye could be seen in the opposite direciton like two big giants. We finished at Buckingham and left via the Mall and through the arch at the bottom. We passed Trafalgar Square and made our way to famous Leicester Square. There were movie theatres on all sides of the area where they have the London movie premieres and stuff. We sat down to eat at Garfunkel's, even though there were about 4 Pizza Huts in the area lol.  After that we took the veyr hand bus service to Covent Garden where there were loads of little shops and market stalls selling cool things. There were a few open caf√©s with singers etc. The atmosphere here was very pleasant and calm despite the masses of crowds. I bought lots of little British goodies from a market stall to take to America with me. I bought a few flags, a cap and various little keyrings and things. After getting back to the hotel, my camera card bursting with pictures of our adventure across London, we were relieved to be able to flop down on the bed and relax, looking through photos with Grandma who had returned from work. For tea we set off out to find a Mcdonalds and we found one a few blocks away from the hotel. I ordered a Big Mac to try out their free music download offer (what, I gotta have a go!)  We were then suprised to a night visit to Westminster. I got my camera out and we waited many minutes for the 91 bus to Trafalgar Square to arrive. We got there in minutes and departer to the brightly lit streets of London at night. Traffic lighting and floodlights for the monuments created a brilliant atmosphere all around. We got to Big Ben just in time for the Ten PM chimes which totally brought the whole experience to life. The large clock was illuminated entirely and stood magnificantly on the riverside. I took a few pictures of Westminster Abbey and then we crossed over to Westminster Bridge to sneak a few of the beautifully lit London Eye and more of Parliament and Big Ben. After snapping loads of photos we went back to the hotel.  Today has been so amazing, and yet again I am yet to believe it really all happened. Here I am sitting here in the early hours of Sunday morning reporting to you my amazing day across London and seeing some pretty amazing stuff! I better go and get some rest now because tomorrow, or rather today, is our last day here and we are going the the Natural History Museum, the London Science Museum and then hopefully, the British Museum. Good night!
