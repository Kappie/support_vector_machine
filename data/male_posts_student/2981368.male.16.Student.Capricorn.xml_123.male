England had chronically bad repeat descisions against them (to a sickening scale, like Vassel trying to head a long pass) and in particular, getting a perfectly good goal by Sol Cambell disallowed in the last minute of normal time. A goal that would have put us in the semi finals. The ref was miles away, and couldn't see. The linesman said the goal was ok, and the official UEFA regulations say in that situation its up to the linesman. Somehow we managed to drag it out to a penalty shootout, which we might have won if the penalty spot didn't crumble every time anyone tried to kick the damn ball.  If UEFA have any sense they'll put this right and ban that bastard from refereeing any big matches for a year or two. Or even put the rightful winners into the semis. I'm fairly sure they can overturn his descision and do that. Either way, Ernst is now on the list of the biggest assholes in the world. He makes Mara-fucking-donna look like a devout England fan.  Bah. Anyways. Today was book-takey-back day...in other words, an opportunity to spend the morning chatting with Holly, Nat and Jack, every now and then signing off from a few teachers. So...I'm signed off, and could (if I really wanted) go and get a full-time job. Erm, woohoo?   Only  really  interesting things that happened today were:  - Nat trying to sorta frontflip off the stage in the main hall - Mum cutting open her hand and needing a tetanus jab - Everyone discussing how much of a complete git Meier is. Yes, even the people who I would never have thought would care had an opinion on this (as they generally dont like football) -  urlLink A vending machine in a Texas Hospital exploded and started spewing out toxic gas  -  urlLink US Vice President Dick Chaney told a senator to "fuck off" and "go fuck himself"   Oh, and once again: "THE REFEREES A WANKER!"
