       
      Fraudcast News will temporarily stop covering news beginning today. This is mainly because I, as the editor, will have other priorities during the summer. I will not be able to dedicate the time needed to come up with and post satirical and fake news.  Look for new postings beginning in the first week of August. I will make a post a week or so before I will start posting.  You still  may  see a few new stories here, but don't count on it.
