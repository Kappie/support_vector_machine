Some people say Britney is crap because she makes pop music, and it's written for by someone else. Of course because she didn't make it herself it's not good, and because lots of people like it it is crap. Well, Christo merely designs an artwork (wrapping pont neuf it may be) and then he gets other people to do it, does that make his art any less valid? no. Shakespeare was popular at his time, does that mean that he was bad? no.   With all of the artistic areas (visual performing musical...) i think there is two layers, one layer wich is the artistic explorative, the stuff normal people don't get(why does the curtain only go up half way, why are they just a random sploge of paint etc  And then thereis the area for the common person, stuff that is there to look and sound good.Britney, Anything from Hollywood, posters and advertisements,   in conclusion i think there are two levels to art the high art, which is meant for artistes and the common level things which arent normally called are, but are pretty similar, poster adds etc..  I'm listening to  Larger Than Life  from the album "Millennium" by Backstreet Boys for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5
