Some things you can expect to see: Me ranting about various stuff; reviews of various movies, anime, and manga; random nonsense;  the Quote Of The Week; bunch of other stuff.  Tomorrow I'm gonna attempt to review The Day After Tomorrow.  Or maybe later today.  I don't know.   QUOTE OF THE WEEK for 6/02 (Changed on Wednesdays)  "I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I don't swear.  Shit, I do smoke and drink.  Well, one out of fucking three isn't bad."  - Adam_The_Unpredictable
