I thought long and hard about how to begin this blog, some Beatles perhaps, or Beach Boys, James Brown, Clash, etc. In the end, I decided there were too many "classic" artists to choose from, so I just picked a band who I've been listening to recently. That band was Television.Their debut album,  Marquee Moon  (1977) ,  is aclassic to be sure- debatedly the bestalbum to have come out of the CBGB's scene of the '70s -but it's aless well known classicthan  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ,  Pet Sounds ,  London Calling  etc.   Television - Prove It (MP3s are taking a while to get working - should be done soon)   A couple of months back I remember XFM doing an "exposure" feature on  Marquee Moon , the three tracks they picked for the viewers selection were Marquee Moon, Venus and Torn Curtain. Venus won, though my own personal suspicion was it was rigged: I thought Marquee Moon should have triumphed, but at 10:47 it would have been far from a commercial radio station's normal choice.  At any rate my own personal favourite from the album is Prove It. Verlaine's (the lead singer) lyrics here are at their best and I find the snarling challenge: "Prove It" to be one of the most appealing moments on the album. The interplay between the guitarsis as solid andsimple here as it is on the rest ofthe album. That's what makes the album so special, in my opinion; the way the fantastic economy of the band works in conjunction with Verlaine's beautifully simplistic songwriting. Without a doubt Marquee Moon should be classed as one of the greatest and most innovative punk records ever.  The band went on to make two more albums:  Adventure  (1978) and  Television  (1992) though sadly neither of them really lived up to the impossibly high standard set by their debut. The band are still performing in their original form (I think) and were ironically featured in one of this year's major festival's- I think it was Glastonbury's -"New Bands" tent.     urlLink [Buy Television -  Marquee Moon  from Amazon.co.uk]
