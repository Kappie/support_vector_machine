To understand this story you must know two things:  there is this random storage building thing shaped like a barn in my yard and our lawnmower has headlights.  Because our lawnmower has headlights, I felt the need to mow the yard in the dark.  A short while ago my mother came outside and started yelling something to me.   What she was really saying:  "Put the lawnmower in the barn." What it sounded like she was saying:  "Add water to the porn." Yep, that's my story.
