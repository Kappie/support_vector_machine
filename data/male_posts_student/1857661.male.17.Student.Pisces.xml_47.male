Time passes so quickly until i didn't notice that I have so damn many unfinished homework especially the Interact Club's annual report. I have been a lil' lazy lately, sigh...  ~ Went to Petaling Street just now with my sister and her lover. I got myself the box II for GetBackers which means I only have one more box to get before completing my collection. Petaling Street is damn crowded. It is such a busy market from morning to night, attracting hundreds of tourists to that place everyday I guess. Lots of pirated discs... a guy even asked me whether I want some pornographic vcds or not. I wonder why that happens to me everytime I go there. It's either I look mature, or I look horny! Sigh...   Still, I had a great time there. Saw many gays there... or maybe they are just friends who are holding hands for the fun of it. Btw, there was one of my favorite food there which is fried wanton! It was expensive though... 20 cents for one. Bought ten, ate all. Thinking about food, it reminds me of some pictures I took last year. Can you guess where all those food came from?           If you have guess our school canteen, then you are right! Our canteen food has never look any better I guess...
