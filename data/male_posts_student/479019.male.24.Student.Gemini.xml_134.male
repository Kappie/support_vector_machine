       
      I had work this morning at 8:30 AM... picked up my cap and gown... watched the  The Fast and the Furious ... took a nap... finished my social science paper... and then watched RAW. A pretty productive day! It's only 11:43 PM, but it feels like it's way later.  Tomorrow I need to make some phone calls, turn in my paper, pick up my Humanities tassel, go to work, and then work on my note card for my stats final. It seems like I'll be pretty busy the whole week!   My plans for Wednesday are to work and finish my history paper. Thursday I have my final final for stats. I also plan on turning in my history paper that day. As for Friday, I have work in the morning, I need to pick up my blue cord for being in an honor society, and then I'm going out to eat with the Shadowfaxians from freshmen year. That should be a fun reunion!  ***
