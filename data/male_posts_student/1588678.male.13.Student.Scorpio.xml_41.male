Both were there, but then all of a sudden; The Cure! I knew that I needed a Cure album because I didn't have one. So I scrolled through their CDs and found a best of CD called Galore. So I looked at the back, and I read to myself, "Hmmm, Just Like Heaven; nice, ah, Pictures of You; cool, alright, Friday I'm in Love; sweet! So I had to buy it. Unfortunately, Barnes has a reputation for having shitty prices on CDs. I mean that by, this 18 track CD was $20! That’s good money, but what can ya do? After I bought it, I listened to it like 2 times last night, and once this morning. It’s THAT good!  Well, well, well. My grade for an album of this kick-ass status. I’ll have to give it a ****. It’s really good, but I’m not that into The Cure, but my goal was to buy this album and get to like them. I’m sure in the near future, I’d give this album a ****1/2 or even a *****! So if you’re into good 80s rock, that kinda stuff, go to your local record store and pick up a Cure album. Believe me, you won’t be disappointed.
