If Im not fencing, I'll be helping in the afternoons - schedule is as follows:   2-3 : help out with stuff in the afternoons  4th : helping in the afternoon, but with any luck it wont be the Div III foil day and the tournament wont last until 8 pm  5 : U-19 Men's Sabre  6 : U-19 Men's Team Sabre  7 : Div II Men's Sabre  8-9 : help in the afternoon  10 : Senior Team Men's Sabre     Div III Men's Foil  11 : Help break down venue  Okay - just checked for the fourth and all the events are team or age restricted...meaning they should be relatively small...hooray!  And you guys are welcome to come to some of the events if you want - just ask me about times and all  -mikeo  "Those who live by the sword, die by the sword"
