I'm so used to just throwing my clothes in the washing machine, dumping in a cap full of detergent, setting the thing on 'Heavy Soil' and having them pop out clean 45 minutes later. And now, I get these petulent little yellow splotches that just won't come out. I've put them through 4 - count 'em 4 - times, and all I have now are faded yellow splotches. Clorox has, so far, proven useless, though this may just be because I'm applying it incorrectly. I intend to seek the aid of the all-knowing mother in the morning (or rather,  later  in the morning.)  It was fun having a massive, torential storm for the 4th of July. They had to cancel the parade and the concert on the Capitol lawn (though they ultimately decided to go ahead with latter), and they came quite close to cancelling the fireworks, too. There was even some talk of postponing the festivities until the next day. What an Independence Day that would have been - Happy 5th of July, everyone! Heh heh heh...
