Our TBCM lesson was really interesting, talking about a scenario and the different interpretations everyone was amazing, each had our opinions but at times it was really funny and they say case study discussions are boring. And we ended early at 10.35 pm, which was like 25 minutes earlier.   After our UWOS practical, I waited for Terence and while waiting I was with Roger and we somehow met Fushun in Foodcourt 4, and we waited and ate desserts till I had to go. Today the ice was rather fine but not as fine as the ones in the local markets and what's more, they cost like 40% lesser.   I don't know why I eat so slow, even when I start eating first, I always end up last, is it that my eating rate is slow or I eat more, I don't know why too. Hopefully that will change in the future. After that, we went to the Toa Payoh Gym from 6.00 pm to around 7.10 pm, a minor work out, but it felt nice. I gained 0.4 kg in 1 hour, I weigh myself before the gym and it was 57.2 kg and at the end when I weigh myself again, it was 57.6 kg, amazing isn't it? And I trained for like 1 hour.   That's all for today, I wanted to touch on something but then again, I have no time, I just reached home at 8.30 pm and I got school the next day ...
