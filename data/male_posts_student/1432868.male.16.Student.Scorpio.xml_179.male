You like indie music, sure, but that's only part of it.  You'll listen to any old shit as long as it sounds good to you. You're not snobby about music at all, you  just like what you like. How boring. Curiously, this makes you popular with the opposite sex.     This has got to be off...I am not being surounded by adoring women....*looks left....looks right* damn remember if you want to date or talk about music e-mail me, plz? STOP RUNNING AWAY!!!!
