By that time all the treadmills are taken up, and I like to start my workouts with at least a mile run. That gets my heart rate up, and my body warmed up sufficiently before my lifting. The bikes just don't do it for me. Stair steppers are good for warming, but given my crooked knees the restricted movement doesn't feel so good. Also I don't want to wear out my legs when I have to stand for 6 hrs at work later.   For the record, I'm not much of a lifter. I'm not about maxing, or body building. I just sort of keep in mind general things like form, rest and eating protein before and after the work out. I lift more for general muscle endurance, so that I can carry gallons of milk to the car or push people out of my way in the pit.   It's a month and a half into summer, and still 2 months away from the start of a new semester. Binghamton feels really far away right now. I'm trying to read before my shifts at work, to keep myself academic.   ***
