Im single (still not used to iteven tho its been like 4 months... well im used to it, but im NOT reaady for another 10 monther) 2. girls are crazy (i have begun to realize that im not the ugliest guy in the world. it seems like a lot more girls like me now that im single from the evil clutchess of sophie. when i was younger it would happpen, but it would be like, when i had a girl, other girls liked me. but when i was single, "Hell nah i dont like him!" well thats what i assumed. so now its weird wehn you can tell a girl likes you.) 3. Phylicia and I are "whatnot-ing" (this is actually a cool part of my life, not so weird, wait, yeah its werid. like, there once was a girl named simone. now dont get me wrong... simone is still there and shell always be a part of the life of Superman to an extent. but things got messed up with that a little while ago. but yeah, with me and phylicia, its like we were there all the time, but we never got together. we talked for a little while, but it didnt work cause of parents, phone stuff, accesbility... other people. but i guess that stuff isnt a problem now. its like cool cause she seems to be the perfect girl. or one of the few that ive ever known.... crazy, open, pretty...sexy (lol corny), caring, affectionate, not Prudish. there are more, but i dont wanna write them all (it would take 18 pages). basically im in "trip mode" cause i keep thinking about this one girl. that doesnt usually happen. its happened one or two other times in my life. so now we are talking and its Great. there are still a couple or limiting factors tho. but whatever... maybe later) 4. Family/friends are changing (or maybe its me. its like weird hanging out with isaac and brad now sort of. its like with isaac, i might want to go to a girls house or to see a friend, and hell have to be there. but liek i dont ALWAYS want him to tag a long. but isaac is still my best buddy. with brad tho... its weird. he just seems to be getting different than me more everyday. he criticized me for hanging out with this girl, and hes even called me a "slut" (even tho i havnt done anything). its like, he doesnt talk to girls, jsut anthony and billy, then he is so unresponsive. he doesnt get excited about anything except for this game that he wants to buy. i cant go to parties with him cause he wouldnt wanna dance, and he would just get bored and want to leave. i dont kno if its me changing or him changing but i kno somebody is. its most likely me tho, i like hanging with raymond and antwuane more nowdays, and i really dont liek a lot of my family anymore. its like they are all mean and kuniving. i think everyone in my family starts saying that as they get older tho. idk... i think im just maturing.) 5. my grandpa is dying (this actually sucks really bad. hes been ill for a minute now, but it is just soo wack to know that its coming really soon. when i found out... that was the first time i had cried in longer than i could ever remember, but now its like... i cant cry about it, but it makes me just as sad. i guess he is pretty old, but he never seemd old until he got this colon cancer shit. man... its so depressing. but at least i kno its coming. if my grandma goes tho, thats gonna kill me too...)  well, my life is sooooo weird, like i said before ups and downs, and ups and downs, but somehow i can always give off the appearance that everything is cool. i guess you really have to know me to kno whats really up. ~~cya~~
