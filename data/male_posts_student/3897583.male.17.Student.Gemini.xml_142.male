I undertook the project about a week ago, when something Aurojit Panda said, sparked my interest in making this bot. It has gone beyond reporting status for people who have added OSI to their contact lists.  It now uses the ALICE engine to generate AI responses over the MSN network. Feel free to add her to your list.  The MSN id is "osibot@hotmail.com", minus the quotes ofcourse. You can enjoy OSI's benefits as soon as you add it to your contact list!  Enjoy.
