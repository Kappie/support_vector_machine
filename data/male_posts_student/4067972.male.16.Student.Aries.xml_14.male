We were there for about 8 hours.  My aunt has a booth.  She sells body cream and stuff "Farmhouse Creations".  She and her 'business partner' have a lawyer, an accountant, and everything.  I'll probly be over there tomorrow again.  My cousins are going to get an armband thing and ride the rides.  They want me to come and watch. I'm gonna be my mom's designated driver tomorrow.  She's having a pool party with some friends.  I have to take her in the morning and pick her up at 11.  At least i get the car all day. I'll see  you  at summer heat tomorrow. bye.
