I woke up at 12, and went on the computer, at 2:30, i went and watched a program about immigrants, then at 3, i went and got dressed and came back onto the computer. And all day, i've just ate, drank and spoke to people I don't even know very well. Its absolutely rubbish!!    Later on, I should get really far on Legacy of Kain: Defiance and then watch the end of return of the king.and sleep.
