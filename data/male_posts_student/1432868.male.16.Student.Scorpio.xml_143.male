As I was walking I was thinking about what to do  with college and all the other junk I need to start thinking about. Small school big school? what school? what to do with my life?  picking out what corner would be best to beg on when I lose my job.... that sort of stuff. :-P may talk more later.....but I think I'll go have a life now bye  oh yeah Was introduced to a great pic today   thanks Jeffrey :-)
