I mean sure you can have your little right to disagree with him and whatnot...but making shirts and memorabilia that mock his speech and looks is just kind of immature. Go ahead, dislike him and the way he leads and the decisions he's made...but lets all be adults here. Google is trying to take us as Americans slightly out of elementary school and I respect that.   On another not so pleasant note, I despise someone. They actually make me sick, but they are in my heart and prayers at the same time. Apparently this person thinks I will get a kick out of them mocking every aspect of my life. ie. my house, faith, friends, opinions, politics, and even my own future. Seriously, they think I'll find it funny. Thankfully God has held my tongue on many occasions. Otherwise I would forcefully verbally crush them into crud. This person went from being a life long friend to...I can't even describe it. It hurts though. Good friends are really, really hard to come by. I hope that anyone who is willing to be a decent friend to me will find that I will stick with them til the end. In this case though, I've been tossed aside, thrown into a stereotype, and then not even considered. They bring me down. I'll be there if they ever need me, and I'll let them know that, but for now...  Time to sever a friendship.
