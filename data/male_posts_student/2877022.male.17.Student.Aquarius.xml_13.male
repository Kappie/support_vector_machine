This is  elsa , ringleader of the mean girls ( im ringleader cos i started this whole mean girls thingy but we know the real mean girl is manda lah hor? ). this is my first time writing in a blog, or actually typing on the computer for non-hmwk stuff.Anyway, the main point is . . ."Mean Girls Movie" alert! All mean girls  MUST  watch after school next friday. Special attention to Nuria, shujun ( i treat u lah :), anyway u refused my $1 ice-cream b'dae prez, jus come OK? pls . . .),mindy (must pon ur cooking lesson like u promise kay?),wai teng (instead of giggling everytime i ask u to watch mean girls, why dun u ans me yes or no?).Manda, christina and elsa all can make it already so the rest must show support and loyalty when we plan mean girls rampages.     Oh, guys u can also come and join the mean girls and become mean  boys  (actually more like mean gays after u watch the movie, but nvr mind lah hor? as long as u accompany us and chaperone the mean girls).      Finally, pe today was actually  EXCITING  cos the gals won(!) and the guys lost.Yay! Sweet revenge! Future captain's ball sessions shid be played w these same rules but we can add some more such as girls can dribble and all "out" balls belong to girls no matter who touch last.  p.s. i got idea about (some of the) mean girls nicknames for blogspot. i know u guys already have ur own but anyway . . . CHRISTINA - Bao Zhu or Desperate MINDY     - Elephant or "Ah Sao" for chao fan NURIA     - Mrs Goh    Eh, shujun wat's the cheez joke bout ian? How come i said it but i dun noe? N who is nus?
