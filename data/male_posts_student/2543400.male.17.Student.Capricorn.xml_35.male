Ah well, friends are friends for life.  Noor, Cecilia, Stephanie, Thuyet, Jason, Fabian, and me went to see Shrek 2 and went out to eat at I love Teriyaki, forgot the damn pictures, and hella took out the camera too. I'm a fucking idiot! It was fun though. The waitress asked where Amanda was, lol, we do go there often though. Laughed seeing Shrek again, Ponicco rocks :p "I'm a real boy!" And Puss in Boots, man that was so cute, almost wanted to buy a cat.  Took my Physics and Math finals today, I have a feeling I did not do so well. There is no point in me going to class morrow. Nothing to do there!  Man I'm gonna miss everyone! :( And well this means I'm a senior now, lol, or almost.  Well all I want to write for now. Maybe more later.
