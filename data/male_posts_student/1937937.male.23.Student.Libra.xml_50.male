I practically live with her as it is, and I know that she likes having me around; I pay $500 to stay in a place that I don't ever sleep at, and she pays $650 for her place -- it seems like it makes sense to split the costs of living in just one place.  Instead of saying yes right away, she wants to go to dinner to talk about it.  So I have to wait until 7:30 before I can find out, and I'm no good with waiting.  I love her.  This is scary... I've never lived with a girl before -- well, that's not true, I live with Marcia, my landlady, but she's dating my roommate, so it doesn't really count.
