And started studing, i studied for 3 hours - is it believeble?-, grammatic, literature, termology and math. Then i went to the video store, anf got "8 mile", with Eminem.  I figured something really interesting about the party of yesterday. I met the math teacher and the gramatic one. And the math teacher started to say that i am, the son that every mather wants to have, that i'm nice, i work hard,i'm a nice friend but i don't like math. And the grammatic teacher affirming, that old bitch, she hates me! Whatever, it's the second that he - math teacher - does it. Perhaps he really likes me, a math teacher liking you, it's always good.
