Tonite i got into a major fight with my dad, and then had to go to work for a freaking half an hour, to finish up training on paperwork for a managers position.  I was already in a bad mood, let alone i had to put up with someone at work who would not stop talking to me about my previous boyfriends! Well then i went home and was waiting on rach to come over when my dad showed up at my mom's house!  We all got into a big fight which wasnt good!  Well then tonite, i was waiting on eric to get on the net, to talk to him b/c he is a really easy person to talk to, and i texted his phone and told him there was an emergency, joking around! well he took me seriously, and being the sweetheart he is, ran home to talk to me! Now i feel terrible that he did that!  I completely wasted his nite over a dumb joke! i am so sorry eric!  Rach come over tonite, and now we are watching mtv movies awards and being retarded doing crosswords!hehe! welp have a good nite everyone! -ash-
