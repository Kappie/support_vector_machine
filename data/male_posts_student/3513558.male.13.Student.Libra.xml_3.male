Almost puked. eurgh. What's more, i didn't manage to buy the CD player. Dad came up with the discounting thing when i am in school U.  well, i practised golf, chipped about 400 balls and that fucking gay fag still ask me to get lost coz i chipping with range balls. Oh yeah, wanna fight issit? can you see that your good buddy is whacking putting balls in the range? Ah FUCK. i walked away..  I started my southpaw training. quite difficult to get used to it, but it went quite well. Used batting gloves for catching for my right hand.  well, i ate and then i played soccer.
