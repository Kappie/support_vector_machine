Geoffrey Rush aka Barbossa as LeChuck the undead pirate captain? Keira Knightley aka Elizabeth as Elaine Marley the governor's daughter? Orlando Bloom as Guybrush? Hmm well I dunno about that. Orlando Bloom was less homo in this movie than when he played a pixie elf, until he got the musketeer outfit out. Muskeeters are 15th century and this movie is taking place in probably the early 18th century. Hey there was monkey and it was on an island!  Dig pirates? I recommend the book  The Many Headed Hydra  by Rediker and Linebaugh.  Books? Books!? Shit I have some reading and shit to do. I got some editting done today though.  Oh yea... before the movie. Janet, Julia, Naomi R. and I had some spinach alfredo and mushroom pizza with some ribs. I don't think that pan worked too well for baking pizza. I think thin sheet metal pans works the best. The basil was a nice touch to the crust though.  Work tomorrow, and then Vegas this weekend.  ***
