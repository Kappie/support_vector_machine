This morning, I have noticed a piece of software that have come across my way...Ad-aware...not the Ad-aware 6 everyone have being using, but Ad-aware 6 Speical Edition. So I decided to give it a download and it is GREAT!...it scan files much more carefully and it is able to pick up all different kind of adware and spyware...I would recommend it to everyone...you can go grab it at download.com...but...I need to warn you in fairness that it is kind of slow comparing to Ad-aware 6 and according to others...it some times delet the wrong files...but no problem at my end...so go grab it...  Even with all these great things...my situation of my handbook still haven't changed...uptill this point no one is able to give me something decent for the cover...Time is running out (since the deadline is the 14h) I can only wait one more day...if still nothing good, than I'll have to make it...err...I really don't want to go there...-_-  The weather here in Toronto have been very cool...unlike the last couple of years when it's suppose to be 30+....but this year in the middle of August is surprisingly...very nice  cool, I almost have no use for my AC in my room anymore, but I'm going to keep it anyways...just in case... ;)  All in all....it have been a good day...just wish someone would give me a decent cover page...oh well...nothing I can do...  Till then...  "Ignorance is Bliss"  Neo...
