She's had it for a month at the very least and I had only had it for a week before she borrowed it!  And she only watched the bonus DVD last night!  I'm listening to it right now.  Track 6 to be exact (Sick Sad Little World).  Yay!  Track 7 just came on (Pistola).  This is such a cool song.  Anyway just came online to check out  urlLink Jonathan's ,  urlLink Hazel's ,  urlLink Campbell's  and  urlLink Ramona's  blogs and thought I would post something new cos mine looked kinda neglected.  Actually Jonathan and Hazel have hardly posted anything, lazy whores!  Excuse the profanity.  PS.  You may have noticed that I've discovered how to create links, hence the linkage of almost everything!  'It's just another day in the life of apes with ego trips!'
