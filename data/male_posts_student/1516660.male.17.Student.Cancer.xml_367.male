Me, CQ, Gloria and HuiMin planned to eat dinner. Yes, we did eat dinner. SL joined us. How surprising.  After dinner, we met Janet, PY and Joyce and we proceeded towards YJ. FUCK. Okay. Enough swearing! Okay. En route, I noticed that some twigs resembled a dead rat's tail. So I pointed out "Si Lao Shu!". It made everyone looked and gasp. Heh. A few simple words can cause such a huge pandemonium.   Right. The concert. The first and last song, "Sing and Rejoice" and "One Song Many Voices" respectively, are what our choir is practising. Yes. It sounded quite nice, but the maturity ain't there.   I enjoyed each and every school's performances. They did a good job.  Yes. I have to comment on YJ Chorale. They are the reason (Actually HL is) why I was at the concert yesterday. YJ did well, although I almost fell asleep at some songs. Or maybe I was daydreaming. ;) (That didn't feel right (the typing) the second time round. FUCK! There goes the candidness of this entry!) Anyhoo, I felt the Bass section did especially well. Their voices were clear and good. I didn't hear much of the other sections, SAT, being so distinct. Yeah. Anyhoo, well done YJ Chorale!  Okay. When we came out, we were greeted by the fucking rain. Only three of us (all from Admiralty) and CQ brought umbrellas and there were 8 of us. That rounds up to an umbrella for every two of us. I ended up sharing with CQ, while I lent mine to SL and Joyce. We took the train and went home.    Today   Okay. We went out in the afternoon. We watched Tou Long Zhuan Feng. HAHA! (I feel so fake for putting HAHA! I am NOT in a laughing mood right now. Stupid hangs! Spoil everything...) Her quirkiness and fiesty attitude reminds me of XiaoYan Zi (Ooo! Her initals is XYZ! How funny!). Yes.   Anyhoo, I was also reading this HD slash-mpreg fic,  urlLink (Crying Over) Spilt Potions . MPreg means male pregnancy. Guess who got pregnant? Read and find out! Such a lovely story!  Okay. We went to AMK Central to eat lunch. Then we went to Jubliee Entertainment Centre to make my Popular Discount Card (Fuck again! It seems like my I/C number is written wrongly. The person wrote '7' in my temporary card, but put '9' in the register. Sigh. Have to correct the mistake. Okay. It looks like the cashier typed wrongly. See! Look at the efficiency of Admin people!! I am so never trusting them!) . YaY! I got the 20% Discount thingy.  I used that to buy two books, A Tale of Two Pipers (the last book!! Luckily!) and Artemis Fowl (finally!). That Mother! I placed the 20% discount thingy on the counter and the cashier saw it. My mother felt the need to remind her the existance of the big blatant discount voucher on the counter top. I am sure the cashier got annoyed. I can see it in her eyes. MOTHER!! I hate it when she does that. People have eyes to see! I am sure she will get terribly annoyed when a customer does that to her. I hope someone does (like put a $10 bill on the table and say "There's a $10 bill"). Then she won't do that to others again. Besides, I am the one making the transaction. NOT her. I can make transaction perfectly FINE, without annoying cashiers too, on MY own. Terrible embarassment! I am a firm believer of not offending other people and putting them down. At least not to strangers. If we don't co-exist peacefully, what will the world become?  Right. We went home, I watched Simpson, blah blah blah.  Right. I did no revision. Sigh. Whatever la. Crap.   I gotta get going. Tomorrow's MT. I am sure flunking it. Sucks la. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
