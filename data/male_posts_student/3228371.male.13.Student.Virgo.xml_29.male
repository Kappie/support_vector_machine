I wanna bring Nima Jr. to Sudbury with me but mommy won't let me. :'( I don't want Julie playing with it though 'cos it's my fav. :P   Well, at least Nima Taheri (aka Perfect One) will be there. Hmm, Julie's being weird. She keeps telling me she loves me and that she'll miss me. I thought she found me annoying? Haha! She's always like this when I go on trips that are overnight! Like Camp Wenonah, Kids Clubhouse tent-camping trip, Bethel tent-camping trip, and Camp Cooch. Now this. Haha... weirdo. Bleh, at least I know she really does care. :P  Hmm, I hope she respects me enough to take me seriously when I say DON'T TOUCH NIMA JR. OR NEMO! Meh, maybe I'll let her have a little hug from Nima Jr. before I go. Haha~! Iunno... meh, ish all good.  Well, I'm gonna miss my mommy and sissy and grandpa but its only for a little bit. I'm gonna miss Nima during the bus ride... and my guitar too! Hee hee~! Well, I'm off to bed. I wanted to talk to Nima before going to bed but whatever. He's probably in bed already or busy packing still. Meh, I'll see him tomorrow. Love y'all!  G'nite ye scurvy dogs!
