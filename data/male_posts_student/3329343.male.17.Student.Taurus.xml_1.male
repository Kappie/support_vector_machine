Gotta watch them man titties though, chicken can do that to you. I think I need another piss. Anyway I'm gonna go get my guitar and learn a few  Three Days Grace  songs. But first I will have to get some ice cream, and cover it with m and m's. I have one class at school tomorrow, I think I'm gonna go down to the music shop and buy meself a capo for my guitar.  Currently tuned into  Three Days Grace  - Wake Up
