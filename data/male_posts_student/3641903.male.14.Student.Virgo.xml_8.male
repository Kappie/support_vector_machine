Even though my school is mostly chinese, i have an indiann classmate in my school and even though my class is the worst of the worst(i think), we don't stoop so dam low and insult him well even in the NCC where different races mix, there is some racism in it, like a unit i know who scolded my juniors bloody chinese just because they are malays and are the ones in charge!!! ok i think i have to go to my aunties house now and if anybody wants to go out with me you can just give me a call or something and we will arrange a place to go, ok enough said already my mums screaming at me, bye
