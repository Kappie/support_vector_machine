"Ms. Atherlee has not been paying her rent... the lease contains a clause that says disputes are governed by Kansas law... Ms. Atherlee has never been to Kansas..." and some questions to answer... "Can she assert a defense for lack of personal jurisdiction...."  We have 1400 words to write, and a suggested time of 8-9 hours.  It's practice for the final exam.  And oh what fun....
