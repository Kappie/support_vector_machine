Suzuki Savage LS650. It's sextacular. It's so goddamn pretty it ought to be a she. Hm. Costs a lot of money, high maintenance, requires specific safety gear, loud to the point of dangerous.... it IS a she!!  So I'm going sailing tomorrow, here's to that not being a disaster.  Work has been utterly mediocre. It's been good, but like a nice does of crack, the highs have been offset by some stupid lows. There's an assclown that keeps emailing work because he needs an exchange. Well, wants one. I'm not going to really deal with him anymore cause, well, I just don't feel like. it.  Other folks have been utter stupid. Assclownery seems to be a new passtime or perhaps even a career choice for some out there. I think that could be it, you hit mid life crisis you either get a motorbike, a tattoo, bungee jump or become an assclown.  Guess I'm ahead of the game.  The stargazing's been kind of neat, but the weather doesn't really cooperate that much, we've had such a cold Spring (season, not stream or bouncy metal object) that going outside in the early evening hours to the mid evening hours suck donkey balls for drug money.  I fixed my Timex ironman today. Found it in a drawer, had the urge to fix it. Took it to work, cracked it open, popped in a new battery, flipped the reset and boom, new watch. I love technology.  That's pretty much all for this transmission. Don't take any wooden buckazoids.
