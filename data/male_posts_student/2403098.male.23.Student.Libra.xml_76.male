As my flight descended upon the middle-class mecca that is Oklahoma City this afternoon, I couldn't help but be a little sad.  There is nothing wrong with anything being 'middle-class' because God knows I have about 20 dollars to my name, but leaving my favorite city on Earth that just happens to be extrememly world class in nature only to return here makes me sad.  I miss Chicago already.  I felt almost clausterphobic while I watched out the window at the landscape below that had the words "YOU DONT BELONG HERE, MASON!" written all over it.  No, seriously, there were mobile homes lined up together in the shape of the various different letters in that phrase - spelling out "YOU DONT BELONG HERE MASON!"  I know, I thought it was weird too.  That's a lot of coordination just to send me a message, I figured they could have just passed me a note or something at the airport.  ANYfuck, no more Okie bashing, it's my home for now and a good place to live.  I'm not trying to contradict my previous "I love OU" post at all.  I just had a wonderful time, and now I'm even more antsy to move to Chicago.  I loved looking for places to live and found some great living arrangments.  Still a little too early to sign a lease though, but it was a great start to seeing what was out there.    The weather was fantastic!  A little cool at night, but just perfect overall.  I think I walked more on this trip than I have walked in my whole life, but it was great.  The neighborhoods are so beautiful near downtown with tree lined streets, brownstones laden with ivy, and people walking their dogs.  My favorite place I looked at was a beautiful little apartment on the 14th floor of an older building on Cedar street.  This place will be gone for sure by the time I get to Chicago, as it was priced quite nicely.  Really nice closet space, hardwood floors, overlooking a tree-lined street, vintage buildings, and just a couple blocks from Lakeshore Drive, and a couple blocks in the other direction from Rush street, which is a great area for hip little restaurants and corner bakeries.  Another perk is that it was walking distance from probably the 2nd or 3rd best shopping area in the US: Michigan Avenue.  I wanted to sneak into the bathroom and lock myself in to see if maybe the realtor would just forget I was there.  I'm sure when they did eventually rent the place out the new tenant wouldn't be happy to find out that the place came standard with a Mason.  When you looked out the windows to the left.. there was the massive ocean-like Lake Michigan.  Ahhh, I miss Chicago already.  No worries Mason, just tie up loose ends here, and be on your way.    Misson of my trip to Chicago:  To confirm it was where I wanted to live Mission Accomplished.
