I went to bed at about 2, so if you do the math that’s only 7 hours.  It seems as if my mind wakes me up even if I don’t get my 8 hours.  Odd, that is.  When I go to bed at 12 and I wake up at 7 feeling tired, I’m confused.  How does that work?  Maybe it has to do with there being light in my room or something weird like that.  I once saw a guy on techtv explaining a new kind of alarm clock.  This alarm clock had a light that had, I don’t know what you’d call it but dimming, for lack of any other word, mode that would turn on a light.  The light would get brighter until being fully turned on by the time you set the alarm.  The idea behind it, he said, is to have a more natural alarm clock.  It’s basically designed on the idea of the sun coming up and waking you up.  The one thing that’s funny about this is that when you wake up to this thing, at 5 in the morning, you go into another room and fall asleep.  The things also got a thing where you can put these scent beads that give off smell that’s supposed to wake you up.  Interesting stuff, I think.  Anyways I was talking about how I got up at about 9.  Right, well I did pretty much nothing up until football at 2:30.  I know it starts at 3 but I’m always paranoid when the clock turns to anywhere around 2.  I’m thinking… crap I’ve only got –x- long to do anything before football.  I’d like to officially thank the coaches for making me paranoid about time.  I’m probably never going to miss any important time in my life.  I’ll just get less sleep and my body will age faster, I’ll get gray hairs faster, I’ll get arthritis faster and I’ll die younger.  Thanks!  w00t!  Yeah, so I did pretty much nothing all day up until football.  Football practice went OK.  I think it was one of our best practices so far.  I’m glad it was because if we did worse than Friday, we’d have had most of our practice being conditioning or something callous.  Everyone figures it makes us tougher.. and it does.  It’s just a pain in the ass.  I’m complaining.  Let me stop now.  It’s a pain in the ass, but I enjoy getting it over with because I always feel better when I relax.  Tomorrow is week 2 of school.  Officially the 6th day.  I suppose we’ve only got another 170+ something days until summer.  Shouldn’t be too bad.  I’m actually looking forward to working hard in school and getting better grades.  w00t!  Anyways, in order to get my 8 hours of sleep, I need to go to bed.  Good night.
