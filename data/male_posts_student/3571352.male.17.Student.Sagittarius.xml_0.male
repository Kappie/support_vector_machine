Anyway my mom woke me up at like 5am today to say her computer had a virus... I was like Norton takes care of it.  She didn't believe me so I went back to sleep.  Then she woke me again at 5:30am and said she could not find the file that Norton found... That's because NORTON TOOK CARE OF IT!  She was so pissed off and she said she did not start working on the computer until 6:30am because Norton had to finish and it found no viruses.  She did not listen to me and I told her what to do.  Now she is all-mad at me because I did not get up and take a look.  Now if it was normal human hours I would have gotten up and looked but not at 5am!  So after I got up for real... around 10am I mowed the grass.  The lawn mower safety handle broke thus not allowing me to start it up.  So I had to rig it up to finish mowing, which was real fun. :-/  After that I left for the picnic.  I am at my Grandma's right now so I will post some pictures when I get home.
