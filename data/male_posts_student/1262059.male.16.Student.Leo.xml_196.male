C'mon, you guys shouldn't waste such a beautiful layout ^^ yes... it is indeed very good... good job!   Now, my random ramblings which I hope to cut short, as I know people find long posts tedious and boring and impossible to get through.    There's been quite a few failures recently for me... parents finally found out how far behind I am, which I shouldn't be in the first place. So yah, it means that I have to work harder. Basically it means less wasting time, and less MSN. Which isn't that bad I guess. Also, there was the entire thing about AM which was a total mess, but won't get into that. Then there was horrible goal-tending at 3-ball in our latest game... we manage to pull off a win because of Hanson's buzzer beater, which is good. I certainly hope I can do better next monday facing the winner of JR vs Kyle Bibby's team. Oh, and it was certainly a disappointment when BC lost today (13-9) *sigh* I was hoping that that team would win the championship. eh, and not to mention I left Lynn waiting on the phone for half-hour... =\    Despite this, I'm not really that depressed or anything, don't get that impression ^^;; for a change, I actually got some units done this week, and will start to wake up/sleep early starting today. Woke up at around 6:00, got out of bed at around 6:30 ^^;;   um... where were you guys today? (directed at keane and renae) I - nor a bunch of other people - saw you, so either a) you skipped, b) were both coincidentally sick, c) are dead, d) combination of the above. There might be some possibilities that I missed... but anyhow, I hope you guys are alrite ^^;; oh, and we saw Animatrix today.   ...which was unfortunate for Kwan and Jacky, as they both couldn't make it, and both wanted to see it. I thought that Animatrix was pretty good... they also did a little documentary thingy about Anime and its history at the beginning too... but eh... I saw the best parts of it already: Detective Story and Renaissance I and II. The other have "=\" animation, with the exception of "Program" and "Final Flight" which were runner-ups on my favourites list. The last one - "matricution" - left me with a "???" expression.    So much for keeping it short =P    ~ Chronos
