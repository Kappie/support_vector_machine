I spent the day in misery, with hacking coughs every now and then. So miserable. I felt like vomitting all day long, but I don't dare to. Heh.  Right. Nothing really interesting happened. Okay. I missed PE, because I can't run while coughing, or else all my vomit comes out.   Hmm.... Right. Today during choir, Miss Ong didn't come because she was sick. Poor thing! I hope she feels better soon. Okay. We sang  Sing  Rejoice  and  One Song Many Voices  all day long! Ayioh...I was unable to reach the high notes. Keep having to shut up on the high notes, which thankfully, is at the end of the phrases.  Yeah. Guess what? I got in the MDIS performance! HaHa. Well, there was no choosing la. All the boys got in. Guess there's a desperate lack of boys, eh? Gloria got in as well...weee! Okay. We learnt that MDIS's coperate song. So lame and corny. HaHa. You should hear the girls laugh as the boys sang that "management training" bit...it's like we have to suddenly cresendo and go high pitch at "meh" (it goes like: MEHHH-neg-ment"). HAHAHA! Yeah.  Okay. I managed to persuade Mother to let me stay home from school today. Yeah. I don't feel like going to to school tomorrow la. I came back at 9, ate dinner till 10 and I have virtually no time to do homework. Plus, I fell asleep. Yeah. I have no mood to mass PE (what if Mr Ang don't allow me NOT to PE??), and I haven't finished my Chem yet, and I don't want to face the wrath of Mrs Tay. O.O  Oh my god! How can I forget to say this?!!! I scored more points with Mr Jeremy today! First, he said he liked my English file and my comments for the articles.  Well done , he said! Ain't that something? *flashes wide grin* Also, I didn't participate in the debate, but I wrote points for everyone! I have written CQ's point, and guess what? Mr Jeremy said that CQ is the only one who touched on the topic of censorship is not nedded. His point, or rather mine, is that self-censorship is enough, and renders government censorship useless. Muhahaha! Double score for me! Take that, you idiot MCP (He has proven that he is indeed an MCP through and through. He supported the boys' group, which is us, rather than the girls' group,even though the topic we argued is not what he supports. Who wants his support? Eeeee!)!   Today   Righto. Today, I woke up at 8.30. :P to all of you who are in school at that time. I get to sleep late, and you don't! :P :P :P Right. Lets not make the masses angry (and jealous), alright?  Okay okay. Enough joking. I went to AMK to eat some ku meen (for refresher, it means mushroom shredded chicken noodles, aka the best noodles in the world)! Ahh! Heavenly! I can't get enough of them! KU MEEN!!!   After that, we brought some supplies, then went back home. I did my homework (drew 2 graphs..haha), came online for awhile, then went to eat lunch.   After lunch at Admiralty Place (kuay chap), it was to the doctor's. After getting MC, we went to AMK again to shop for hats and whatnot. I brought a pair of blackleather (I think fake one...but who knows?) shoes. My old one was too small, and childish I might add. Yeah.  Okie. The rest is not really worth mentioning. Okay, I got lotsa tidbits from CQ about today. Okay. Most interesting tidbit. Today in Chem, Mrs Tay got rather upset and scolded the class. Apparently, John fell asleep and that led onto a tirade that seemed to incriminate the whole class. She apparently feels that whenever she steps into S22, she feels like losing her temper. Is our class so hard for her to handle? Sigh...yue wang ar! I am so glad I didn't come.  O.O! We are supposed to go attend this SAF talk tomorrow. Apparently, me and CQ are selected by Ah Tham. Luckily, tomorrow we have this dress rehearsal at Swissotel for the choir and we can escape this nightmare. However, that CQ did not tell Mr Tham that the choir cats are not going. Neither did JunSheng try to save himself. HAIYOH!!! Qi shi wor leh! We are supposed to tell Tham ma...so he can select 3 other cats. If we tell him tomorrow, it will be too late to make last-minute arrangements. I felt rather upset and irrtated that CQ and JS didn't do anything lor!! It's like I everytime have to be the one who informs the teacher leh. Honestly! What's so hard about speaking to the teacher? Qi shi wor!! Ergh...   Okay...calm down. Calm down. Right. I think I gotta go le. Read a story. Heh. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
