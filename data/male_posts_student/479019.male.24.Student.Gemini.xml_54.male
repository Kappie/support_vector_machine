The mission was cool. It wasn't as impressive as anything I saw in Europe, and wasn't nearly as impressive as when I was a kid in elementary school.   Dude!  Manic Hispanic  is fucking hilarious. They are basically a punk cover band, but they put a SoCal Mexican twist on the songs they cover. For example,  Rancid 's "Ruby Soho," becomes "Rudy Cholo" and the  Descendents'  "Der Weinerschnitzel" becomes "Alberto's." This is funny stuff. I need to show this stuff to Brandon. He'd totally get a kick out of this. This also great because the band is from O.C. and has members from such history making groups such as  Agent Orange .  ***
