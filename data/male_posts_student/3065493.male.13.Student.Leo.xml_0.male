I am good at playing  Magic;the gathering  cards. So far, I have collected over  100  rare cards,  200  uncommon cards, and  50  common cards. I like to modify my deck. I usually played the pc version of the game.  I also like WWF cards. I am now still a beginner and I am stil learning the basic of the game. My starter deck now is  Eddie Guerero . This weekend, I am planning to buy the deck titled " Brothers of Destruction ".  I heard that it is a good deck.  I also play with my PS2.  I like the new games this year.  My favourite games are :  NFL streets, I Ninja, Onimusha 3, Metal Gear Solid 2 substance, and Dragon Ball Budokai 2.
