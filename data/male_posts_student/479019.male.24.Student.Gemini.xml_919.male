We hung out for a bit and then I was home again to get some more cleaning done before Melissa came over to hang out.  It was nice hanging out with Melissa, as we made a pizza and just sat around chatting. We talked about all sorts of different things and reminisced about the year. There were a lot of revelations, sick jokes, and deep stuff in those conversations. It was sort of a somber end to the year, as Melissa was talking about how she’s sad the year is over. I can’t say that I’m sad the year is over. I’m actually happy and look forward to the future. There was one very serious thing that we talked about, that does make the future a bit scary. I can only hope that things end up okay. However, aside from that the summer and next school year are things I’m really looking forward to.  ****
