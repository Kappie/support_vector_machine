Charming little flick.  Bob Ivey is unforgettable as the latex-wrapped, fireproofed mummy. His cowboy boots are a great touch, pard'ner. Who woulda thought the story of two old guys in a nursing home battling evil could be so engaging?  Filmed in 30 days on a very low budget, it's destined to become a cult classic.
