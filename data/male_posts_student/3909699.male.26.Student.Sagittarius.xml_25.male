Walking into town today, a gang of metal kids shouted assorted shit at him, like ‘Hail Satan!’ Being a priest is a bit of a liability these days. Later on, horsing around proves to be difficult – play-fighting with and swearing bawdily at a priest doesn’t go down with the old ladies. The only really good effects occur when John breaks character: in the local computer shop, one of the machines is running Doom 3, which both me and John are eager to try out. On John’s turn, the guy who works there comes out and is watching John as he explores the first level. Coming to a scientist who is trying explain something to him, John takes aim and shoots him in the face. The computer shop guy, who John doesn’t realise is there, gives a surprised burst of laughter. John tries to claim that he just thought he was supposed to shoot everyone and we leave. Excited by this foray, John is now noisily machine-gunning zombies in the next room.
