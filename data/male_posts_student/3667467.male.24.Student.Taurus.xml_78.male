Either way, the casserole from last night was left out uncovered for the cat to feast upon. I should have thrown it out right there, but after shooing the cat I put the rest on top of the fridge with the sign "Cat was eating the casserole."   My mother, who likes to keep a bucket of compost in the kitchen just a little to long as habit, responded. "Well I'm still going to eat it, I'm hungry!"  Today I came home and looked in the fridge. Day-old tomato soup. Browning salad. Hot dogs hardened by exposure to air. And a spider, sentry keeping watch over the Tomb of the Unknown Leftovers. I wasn't going to eat that crap anyway, but tonight I'm going to take a stand for sanitation. Something tells me I'm going to be much hungrier by the end of the week, or at least a much more efficient, single-serving cook.
