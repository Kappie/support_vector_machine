I was actually looking forward to go to wild wild wet earlier this morning, little did I know that what was gonna happen in the next 12 hours...  After the celebrations, I joined my friends to sabotage our maths teacher as it was her birthday yesterday. After sabotaging, I ran home to get a quick change of clothes, grabbed my slippers and bike, and off I went to meet (friend T) to cycle to Tampines. After 30 mins, we reached (friend M)'s house. All of us had already planned to meet at (friend M)'s house previously as Pasir Ris is just a stone's throw away from Tampines. After getting ourselves acquinted with (friend M)'s mum, (friend T) and me went straight to (friend M)'s room to find (friend C) and (friend L). Then, came a thunderous news. They told (friend T) and me that SHE and (gal C) is tagging along with us. I was shocked initially, refusing to believe their blabbering, but when (friend M) started to get into a phone conversation with the girls, then I started to believe all those craps that they have been spouting for the past 30 mins. After grabbing some lunch at (friend M)'s house, we started to leave for Pasir Ris as we're already late for 30 mins...  We took a cab to Downtown East, managing to persuade the driver to take in 5 of us. Immediately after alighting, we saw SHE and (gal C) walking in the distance. We stopped them, then we went to wild wild wet together. While waiting to pay for our tickets, due to (friend L)'s inability in maths, I gave him $50, and told him to include HER's and mine. I feel liked I'm being exploited. To me, it's not very common that friends give you a treat, and it is a basic manner to at least say a thank you when someone treats you. But, after treating HER today, SHE was so cold, SHE did not even say thank you like SHE did yesterday... Hell... SHE did not even say a thing after I treated HER. Well, I still could take it at that time as I was too indulged in the prospect of entering wild wild wet. After entering wild wild wet, that's when all my nightmare begins...  All of us had lot's of fun playing together, until when we were stnading in line for a paticular ride called 'slide up'... We queued for an hour, with (friend C) and (gal C) giving up the queue, and then the 6 of us continued to queue without them. When it was nearing our turn, we, then dicovered that we haven't choose our partners for the 2-player ride. As all of the guys, somehow, know that I'm in love with HER, they sabotaged me and HER by partnering each other up, leaving only HER for me, and me for HER. This was when my nightmare officially began. HER face turned sad suddenly. I realised that it was because of HER unhappines of our partnering. Then, I went from zero to, well, still zero... I offered to swop partners with (friend T), but he furiously refused, not realising that SHE was getting unhappy about the situation. Then I approach (friend M) to swop partners, who also blatently refused my proposal. After that, thanks to (friend Y)'s realisation of the awkwardness in the atmosphere, (friend Y) suggested that we pick our partners through the finger guessing game of "black or white"... I could see her sense of relieve right after her partner was changed. I went on to partner with (friend L), with a relieved yet heavy heart... Although the ride was pretty adrenaline-pumped, I felt numb while on the ride, feeling as if I could die from the rejection earlier. It was really a psycological rejection, but, anyone with a brain and a pair of eyes could see how sad SHE was previously, and the reason behind the sadness. I'm a totally changed person at wild wild wet right after the ride. Still, I went on to join them with a brave front, but I felt that I could break down any moment.  When we left wild wild wet, we went to a restaurant to grab our dinner as we were already starving. We had a wonderful dinner. Afer the dinner, we went to shop around in Downtown East. I went ahead with (friend M, Y and L) to the arcade while leaving HER with (gal C), (friend C and T). I went ahead because of the incident that happened earlier, but also a little attraction by Initial D. After some Initial D s, we went home. SHE alighted with (friend C) to board their bus home. I needed to go to (friend M)'s house because my bike's still at his place. I accompanied (friend T) to see (gal C) home. On the way home from Tampines, the images of her immediate change of face was still in my mind vividly.  After (friend T) saw (gal C) home, both of us went for a cup of drink to talk some heart-toheart matters before leaving for home. While at the coffee shop, (friend C) called (friend T) to talk about (gal C), but suddenly, (friend T) passed me the phone, told me that (friend C) had something to tell me. In the next few mins, my mind went from normal to blank. (Friend C) told me that while on the bus home with HER, he asked HER how she thought of me. SHE told him that I was ok. But when he asked if I got a chance of getting her, SHE said NO... I would've smashed the phone if it was mine, but thankfully, it's not. I was stunned, but not too surprised as I know that I do not have the criteria SHE was seeking... I had the compulsion of seeking suicide, but I thought it over. I felt that it would not be worthy to die for love, after all, I'm still 16. There's still so much of the world I'd not seen.  I could've gave up on HER long ago, but I chose to continue as I have this unexplainable soft spot for her. I could not bear to see her cry or get hurt, or even get upset. Now, I'm in a dilemma. I don't know if I could get rid of my soft spot for her, forget her to embrace my future, or continue seeking her acknowledgement, until one day when things would go the way that I dreamed it would. Without fail, I'm still thinking of her at this very moment, but with an aching heart...
