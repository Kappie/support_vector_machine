I went to school last night for about 1.5 hours and I was surprised with the amount of stuff I remembered. I am excited, but at the same time, I can see my self getting drained. Yesterday seemed to drag on forever. I worked my ass off, busy as hell at work. Went to class, came home, washed the dishes, collected the dirty clothes and set up three more eBay Actions.  Check out my eBay Auctions  I really don't know what is going on today. Robert is out in L.A. working on moving the Emerson warehouse to a different building. He has to be there to move the network equipment. I was here at 7:30am and was overwhelmed till about 11:30. James went to the doctor, he has only been here for about an hour and a half. I dunno when he will be back, but I am getting pretty hungry. Also, I dunno when I am getting off tonight. I know I won't be home until after 8pm becuase I have school. I will just have to wait and see.   current mood:  cold current music: face to face - over it
