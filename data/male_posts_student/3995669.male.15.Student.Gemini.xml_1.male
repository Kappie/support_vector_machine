I bought new white sneakers, and two pairs of jeans and a glasses case ... and Lacoste cologne, and I got a free gift with it.  I was wearing a less-than-perfect outfit so I changed in the Coffee  Tea place bathroom (where I purchased two drinks because the first one I didn't like). By the way - their bathrooms are really nice, a lot nicer than McDonalds, so use theirs next time you go to the mall.  Then my back was getting tired carrying all of that, so we went to Sears and I got in a shopping cart and Abby pushed me around in it in the center of the mall - haha. Then she pushed me, and let me keep going and her and Amanda walked away. It was so embarrasing. Then I pushed Abby and her fat behind crushed my shoebox.s  We took the CityBus back to Williamsport then ...  Today I went to Lock Haven for a few hours - there was a problem at the store, and I went out to eat at this good Italian restaurant, The Village Tavern. Their salad is so good. I am working Saturday there too.  Tomorrow I have to go to Lewisburg because my dad is getting his nose done - he has a deviated septum or something.  Right now I am listening to Variety ... it is the dance program, and it is really good.  Abby's name> Keisha  Random Thought: What will happen when we run out of plastic?  I like ... Neopolitan ice cream (especially eating it right from the tub, so I can switch between the three flavors)  I hate ... watching people eat ice cream and italian ice ... it's just really upsetting.  Feedback Question: Are you looking forward to school coming up?
