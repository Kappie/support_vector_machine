The Goat found it quite hard to chew, let alone swallow.  Isn't Peter Garret the voice of the Real Left?  The part of the Left that will never give up hope of a socialist paradise here in Oz?  No, Peter Garret, should he run with Labor, will be part of the Real Politick, the Pragmatic Left that smells of Blair and Clinton.  Billy Bragg signing up to run with Blair would raise a few eyebrows no doubt.  Garret has always had at least one small toe in politics though and almost made the senate once upon a time.  The Goat muses though...what if Latham can't force Kingsford Smith Labor branch members to accept Garret?  He'll be a leader that can't even knock his own party into line let alone the country, that's what.  Why didn't Garret run with the Greens?  The Greens got a huge boost at the last Federal Election and if they're not going to be a flash in the pan but a real minor party contender surely his "star" power would be an asset?  Ahh, elections, they always bring a whiff of feverish political burning of rubber into the air, covering the land in an acrid haze that no one can escape.  The Machiavellian nature of it all...the throne up for grabs...all the permutations and strangulations...eviscerations, now there's something that belongs in politics, get caught out lying and out come your entrails on national television.  Pollies wouldn't lie anymore, that's for sure...renage on a policy promise and out come the entrails on national television.  Future lies could be predicted by the tangled spools of gut...soothsayers would be back with a vengeance...Politics would never be the same again.  With society unable to read politicians guts for arcane secrets, we have to make do with the mumbo-jumbo of journalism, the soothsayers of the 21st century, the spin doctors have replaced the witch doctors and on rolls the beast.  The question remains, how is Latham going to spin the Garret issue?  The Goat has digested and will now predict based upon the regurgitated contents of his stomach.  Latham will bend, push and if necessary whip his party into line and maybe make a reference to lights on a hill reflecting off Garret's bald head.  The party faithful will once again cop it.  The rise of Garret will continue.  Garret's got a perverse desire to actually be in politics and perverse desires will out themselves eventually.  He's going to make his deal with the lesser of two evils.  His line will be the pragmatic - the ends justify the means.  Latham will retain his title of Caesar in Waiting and Johnnie Caesar will mumble his way through hanging his own staff over tortured Iraqi prisoners to avoid the blame himself while comparing D-Day to the situation in Iraq.  If I'm not wrong, WWII was fought because Hitler's Germany started it.  Not because the Land of the Lied Too and Home of the Bush decided forcibly to remove a dictator formerly supported and supplied by the Land of the Lied Too and Home of the Bush.  [The Goat went on ranting here but really, he's strayed off the topic at hand.  Half an hour later the Goat left International Politics and returned to Domestic Affairs]  Garret isn't fan of the Bush, obviously strengthening Latham's anti Involvement in Iraq stance.  The Goat wonders what the Government will have to say about all of this...No doubt, they will highlight the shafting of the local branch members...mutterings will be made about a lack of substance in bringing in a celebrity even though the Bush has just buried Reagan...and no doubt Garret will hug a tree.  Stay tuned to the Goat on the Mojo Wire hacks...
