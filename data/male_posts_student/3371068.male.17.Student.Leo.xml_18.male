Anyways, I haven't been paid for the long weekend yet where I worked all the fucking weekend. They have only paid me for 8 hours. I have worked 26 since I got this job. Fucking assholes. I finally saw butterfly effect last night. I was impressed. Just goes to show if you take a great story, even the worst of actors (the Kutcher guy) can actually do well. Huh. Anyways, I miss talking to Becca and want to hang out with her. I also have to make time to hang out with Emily and Mandy before they go (sob). Aw well, ciao.
