(I'm using immortal in the context of 'not having a limited lifespan') Or, failing that, at least find a way to extend my lifespan significantly. I agree that it is a far-fetched goal, but technology does have 80 or 90 years to develop before I run out of time. Besides real, physical immortality, there are other options, as well.   Downloading my brain to a computer is more realistic, but brings up the tricky problem of souls and consciousness. If the pattern of electrical impulses and neurons in my brain were 'scanned' and transformed into a digital simulation, would "I" still exist? Would "I" die, only to have another digital person born within the simulation?  If all else fails, I'd at least want to be cryonically frozen. Despite the major problem of cryonics (water in cells and blood freezing, expanding, and breaking cells and capillaries - essentially, freezer burn), there are workarounds being studied, such as quickly replacing body water with other chemicals. Even if it hasn't improved, I've got a better chance of being revived if I'm frozen than if I'm a rotting skeleton.  Another, more radical strategy for living forever comes to mind - time-traveling into the future. Despite common conception, time travel to the future is quite easy and feasible - it is time travel to the past that is considered impossible. One may travel to any arbitrary point in the future simply by exploiting time dilation in special relativity. If you were to embark on a journey of several years on a space ship with reasonable acceleration (one that will most likely be invented in our time), several hundred years would go by on earth. The point of all this, of course, is to eventually reach a time in which medical technology has advanced far enough to prevent death from old age. The downside to traveling into the future is that it's a one-way trip - so if you travel 500 years into the future only to discover Earth has gone through a nuclear war, leaving only dust and cockroaches - tough luck.       Evolutionary explanations for things have always interested me. Many people consider death to be a process inherent in biological organisms - this is not the case. If a creature had evolved in such a way that immortality was beneficial to its survival, it would not die of old age. The reason for death, then, is that we become useless to our genes once we reproduce. Evolutionarily speaking, the purpose of any living thing is to reproduce. In humans, reproductive age spans from about 12-45. Notice that there are no large-scale diseases endemic to that age group - this is because we have evolved safeguards against diseases that prevent us from reproducing. If one did not have these safeguards, it would not live to reproduce, and thus not pass on its faulty genes. Those humans that evolved protection against diseases  during reproductive age  did reproduce, and passed on those protections.  After humans pass reproductive age, any mutations that cause disease or decay the human body are allowed to continue on, as they have no impact on reproduction. For example, if a mutation is introduced in a person that causes cancer at age 65, it will not interfere with their child-bearing, as they have already had children (or the opportunity to have children). Death from old age is simply these mutations collecting, growing, and piling up over time, decaying the body.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.tastycicada.com/  how i died today:  urlLink crushed into a quantum singularity   [Listening to: Cocaine -  urlLink JJ Cale  (02:50)]
