I guess I'll get down to detailing the dream before I forget too much more of it.    ~~~  The Dream~  I start off in a colored dream, I'm not really sure of the place [forgot during the whole waking and time and all]. I remember there was something like a family reunion going on but I know it wasn't my family. This isn't the part that was strange even though... The reunion carries on and what feels like hours later I am walking up hill, in my town, beside the Hull and Hull morgue [I guess it could of been a funeral that I was at earlier in the dream?]. I walk along and up the hill and take a Right, which is mostly a dead end except for the two buildings at the end. I keep walking and to my left there are women carrying what look like artwork, from one truck to another, and back again. [Getting strange yet?]. I wander along down the road, in the -center- of the road. I come to the dead end where there is a wall/building and take a right, down a sharp drop off driveway. Down through a doorway I walk and back through some rooms with art and then down into an 'office' like room which is no bigger than a hall closet. The walls look like they are a painting, just made up of thousands of different paintings just hanging there. I sit at the desk which I don't know how it fit in that office or even got in through that small of a door. Sitting at the other side of the desk is a woman, [of course] nondescript looking and we start discussing something. [This is odd cause most my dreams if there is conversation I normally hear it but this time I didn't and it was in color so it was strange too...]. I woke up too early is what sucked, I didn't get to see what happened after, I woke when I was 'talking' to the person... So yea, crazy.   ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.
