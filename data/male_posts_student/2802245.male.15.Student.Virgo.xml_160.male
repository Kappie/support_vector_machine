Unfortunately, I haven't been able to finish my animation on time for the new deadline. However, the movie is still going very strong and I plan to finish it before August 20th. The temp. frums will have to do for the meantime, till we get our new invision one from ABP. One of the affiliates on the site should be BGS offical blog which would like to this! I also need to create a new 33x81 button for BGS and BGS Ofical Blog and some banners, plus a new logo :/ Hopefully, that will be soon. I will also create a new revision of BGS terms and conditions and a doc with Future Info as soon as I have free time. Otherwise, thats all from me right now.
