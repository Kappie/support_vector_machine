It's in much better shape than Reynosa, the border town I stayed in last summer. There are lots of shops, a mall (with very suggestive movie posters), and plenty of crazy drivers that will turn you into street pizza if you're not careful. Yesterday was your typical travelling day. I got up at five (pleasantly surprised to find that I was no longer "down with the sickness") and drove to the airport. I was expecting total mayhem, a line of over 100 cars getting inspected b/c of the code orange that we're at right now, but was also pleasantly surprised to find only one car in front of me. Inside, the line at the Delta booth was reasonable. My dad and I located my flight and then had over an hour to eat breakfast and lounge around. It was just enough, and I got back to gate A1 right as they called my row. My connection was in Atlanta. I met my uncle who's in the FBI at the airport and he showed me to my next flight. We sat on the runway for like 45 minutes but were only 15 minutes late arriving. Hooray. I found Martha and her family, choked a little on the Mexico City air, and then we drove to dinner, then to the hospital so Mr. Sanchez could see a friend, and then to Martha's grandmother's house. Later on that evening, we went over to her uncle's house for hot chocolate. We stayed there for like 2 hours. The adults talked, and the kids played poker and Uno. I suddenly realized how tired I was from my 20 hour travel day and nearly passed out on her cousin's bed. We went home, and I went to sleep. Today I got to see the Aztecan pyramids. Walking up them was quite a chore, especially since I haven't gotten much excersise since soccer ended. But, at the top I got my reward ;) Another one for the collection! Then we came home and my brain melted cuz I watched too much TV. Which reminds me, I've had a "Spanish Headache" and a brutal crick in the neck. My body refuses to be 100% healthy. Anyways, we ate dinner and then went to get some yummy ice cream. Then Martha and I sat down and talked for a long time about everything from anorexia to annoying people. She just got out of the shower, so here she is.   Martha: hello... yay! i got my Christmas present! JD is here in mexico with me... im not that happy tho bc my parents have been really annoying... he already tell u most of what we've done up to know... oh! but he forgot to tell u about is pajamas!!! he has ORANGE pajamas... he looks soooo cute weaing them!!! oh and when he was at the airport i couldnt recognize him bc he looked like a Backstreet Boy! well not really but he looked REALLY cute... hehe... as he told u already he isn't feeling 100% fine and i've been worrying about him and stuff... he met some of my mom's side of the family...  and my cousin the one that he met is the one that "approves" my bfs so ill have to ask him later whats up... haha...  i dont know what else to write... (sorry Brian about all this stuff im writing i know u dont like to read this kind of stuff)   JD:  Yeah... the parents. Hehe, it's funny. When we're in Charlotte, we worry about my parents. When we're in Mexico, we worry about her parents. But they haven't been that bad to me well except for they used to get mad at Martha for talking to me in english b/c my  dad  (once again, parents at the root of the problem) asked Mr. Sanchez and Mrs. Junco to only talk to me in spanish, but I didn't think they'd apply that to Martha.... anyways I kept getting really frustrated that I couldn't communicate with her very well, so I explained to them and they backed off. Now she's a little bit happier but still worrying a lot about me. I'm just tired and aching all over so I'm not my usual smiley self. Tylenol has helped some, but I think a good night's sleep will do even more. Tomorrow we are going to see the butterflies that have migrated to Mexico for the winter, so I have to get up early.... bah bah bah. Now I have to go make my sandwich. Good night people. Luv ya Martha :)   Martha: People i worry about him bc he is my guy! i have a good reason to be worrying about him!!! (now he will take a shower and put on his cute pajamas....mmmmhhhmmmmmmm) Good night people... i luv u more   THE END
