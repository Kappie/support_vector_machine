The 35-year-old defendant, identified as Pierre, was sentenced Tuesday by a court in this southern France city to a three-month suspended prison term.  The man he tried to run over was unharmed...  The victim, a man in his 30s, was able to run from the oncoming car, which crashed along the side of the street.   Talk about bad luck and bad genes.  That'd have to suck lookin like bin Ladin.  So, all of you other Osama bin Ladin impersonators/look-alikes, you better watch out.  Look both ways before crossing the street, and watch out for any of those crazy French.
