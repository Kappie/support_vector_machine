For $2.22 you get to indulge in 2 pieces of the Colonel's finest artery clogging fowl and small fry. Amazing! You can hardly buy  raw  chicken that cheaply at the grocery store, even before people cowered in fear from the Avian Flu.  So, as I sit here, finishing up  two  meals, I am one contented person. Thank God this special only happens once a week, because it takes about that long before you can even think about doing it again. Blech...   Currently gorging myself on horribly delicious "food."
