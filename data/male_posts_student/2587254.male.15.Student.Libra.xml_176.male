Oh well....savouring my last few days as gr. 10 hehe....today wasn't that bad. Late start dah =). Yup that means I wake up at 830 for school and I'm still not late =P.  SO got up this morning at 830, did you know the usual stuff. Eat, hygiene, get dressed, etc. and headed out the door around 840. Had to go there a wee bit early to rehearse with Niki and Kelsey for their solos today in music. So got there, practiced a bit...  And then the moment of truth. Yup...solos. I don't go till Thursday, but Kelsey and Niki went today so I had to do the piano. I think they did alright. I screwed up a few times, and when I played w/ Kelsey she came in maybe a bar early so we were out of sync for a bit. Oh well...other than that it went well =). On the whole, most of the class sounded good.  Science: we finished soil lab. Oh yeah did my speech today...it sucked haha.  Lunch...ahh for once I went out again. To Jasper's I went, where I had a philly steak wrap. Mmm.....so good....downed it with water since I ran outta money =P.  Bio class we started review. Hmm....yeah I think I'm screwed for the exam....I forget everything we are reviewing lol. I'm not the only one though. Our whole class forgot about hormones that help with digestion (i.e. Insulin). Wow I can't believe I'm talking about biology in my blog...*shudder*  English...finished monologues. I did mine...GOT 82% WHOO HOO! I'm not going to fail English...er Chinese Fail. Actually I've done that already....so I can't Joe Fail =P.  After school....worked on history project, played PS2, and ate and stuff. Yeah not much...mostly cooped up in here w/ the air conditioning on. It's scorching out there. Well was....right now it's night so not as much...  Anyways yeah....can't wait for the summer....started planning yesterday when I was bored haha. Yeah...Toronto for sure...Anime Convention doubt it now...since no one else I know is going. Paramount this year I'm hopin' to round up Jenn, Gerts and Ju and em and go...oh yeah plus the usual Gavin Dave and whoever else. Josh may come this year since he found out he can stand roller coasters. CONGRATS JOSH.  Anyways...to shower then study for bio and then plan out summer =P. Later.
