I just paid him 20$ I owed him and 10 more to go. I could have that money by now but my dad has decided that he isn’t going to pay me the 10$ he owes me. Today I saw Signs (Pretty good thriller movie. My dad didn’t like it because it mentions God, but that’s his problem.). We were getting candy for the movie from London Drugs. The usual, stuff as much stuff into your pockets because theatre candy is too much and it's more fun to sneak stuff in. Well anyway, he had told my brother and me that we could get what we wanted. So I got a Snapple, chocolate Pocky (or is it Pokey?) box, and a tube of mini M’s. On the way out I spotted some sweet Star Wars Pez dispensers and decided to grab a couple of those. My brother grabbed about the same things as I did. After we had paid and started to walk to the car, my dad informed me that I owed him money. Somehow my brother and I combined had spent about 10$ and he wanted his money back. He  told  us that we could take what we wanted and now he was saying that he was only going to pay for 2 candies, the cheapest ones and I owed him the rest. So that meant that he didn’t owe me any money anymore and that I was now out 10$. Now there is no way my brother is going to reimburse me so I’m stuck till I can guilt my dad into giving me the money back. Its either he gives me money or I'm never letting him borrow money again. What a family hey? Hopefully I’ll be out of the hole soon. Then I can continue being poor.  I was hoping that my pennies would survive until I was an old lady. That way I could go to the store and by something huge with only pennies and count them out very slowly, one by one. I have big plans for when I'm old. Bug as many people as I can. I think I might even pretend to go deaf and just never wear my hearing aid so I can see what people say about me behind my back.   Along with the fact that I don’t have any money, is that I can’t get a job because I’ll be leaving in less then 2 months. Nobody wants to hire me for 2 months now except for berry picking and crap like that. No thank you, but I prefer not to get heat stroke every day while working. I’m being sort of picky because I refuse to work at a fast food place or as a waitress. They get treated like less then crap and I’ve seen what those kinds of jobs can do to a person. I just wish that I could get a job and have money right now because everything I want to do involves money. Fly to see Louis ---> money, buy digital camera ---> money, etc. Why can’t money just fall into my lap and not have me do anything for it? Because the world didn’t want me to be one of those snobby rich kids, it wanted me to be a poor whinny kid.  In summary: I NEED A JOB!   - Dark Lily  0>--}----
