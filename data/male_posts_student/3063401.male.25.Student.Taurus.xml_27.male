 or: "It's a real cracker" - as Jonny would say...
 
 It's that time of the year.... Yanks vs. Sox. It's gonna be nasty, I am sure of that. I really have to look in the pitching probables. I might have seen Pedro's name coming up in one of the games, so it's gonna be really fun...
 
 And then the NHL playoffs will get serious tonight. Teams are facing elimination. When am I supposed to sleep??
