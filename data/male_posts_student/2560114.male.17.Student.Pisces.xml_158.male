It was sooooo fuckin windy that i played like shit and i jus got frustrated and i wanted to like kick my own ass, haha. Well thats my day so far, today im probly jus got redecorate my room cuz it still has all of the basketball stuff from my baller dayz, so i guess i might as well change it up. And probly today im jus gonna get a little boozed up for the hell of it...later dayz.
