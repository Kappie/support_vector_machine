I don't plan on adding links, but I'll link this from my other blog. I'm not adding a tagboard either - so please use the comments system. Besides, if there's long posts of criticism you can't fit them into a tagboard anyway. =P Or if you're really lazy you can just use the tagboard at my main blog...  It'll be a Harry Potter fanfic - with real characters, i.e. the characters are all people I know. So, erm, any resemblance to people is purely coincidental. =D I know I didn't ask permission to use your names for most people, but I hope you don't mind. I assure you, none of you are evil. And it is never, ever meant to be offensive. It's supposed to be good fun, so I hope everyone's okay with that.   Well, I don't think my writing's very good. But I hope whoever reads will like it anyway.
