I think I was a bit overtired yesterday at work, as I was much more talkative and hyper than I usually am. It's either that or I am bitching to go home because I'm tired - so I will stay with the overtired point.  I haven't really been writing much lately - I don't feel any sense to. Today however, when I woke up, I thought I may just write some more later as I think that now with everything levelling off in my life, I may have the perserverence to do so.   The other day as I re-did my thoughts page on my website, I edited a lot out and added some information in that I didn't have on my other site. My views slightly changed in some areas, but became much more specific than what they were in the original indications.   I just reflect on the changes my minds gone through in the last few months.... it's amazed me. I can admit to myself that I am true and that I have nothing to impress anybody else about. I love it though, I no longer need to waste my time on worthless matters that only end up blowing up in my face in the longrun. Life is much too short to dwell on what you can do to make yourself seem so much better than others.  The context in which "better" is used, shouldn't even be able to stand firmly for itself. It's not possible to be better than anyone. Everybody has their strong and weak points, and even though people tend to focus strictly on negativity - the positive and negative in each of us balances equally.   Equality, in my opinion is something that will never be fully accepted by everybody. I really dislike when other people discriminate against others for their race, religion, or beliefs. Who is ANYBODY to ridicule for such things? That's the problem with today - people are far too judgemental and ridiculing that if it's not done their way its automatically bad, wrong, evil or "uncool".  I tend not too care about what people say about me anymore because I rest assure each day that I am happy with who I am and I know that the people who wish to ridicule me for the way I think or for what I believe in, are obviously people I wouldn't be caught dead associating with anyway. Either way, I win in the matter.  A word of advice... your never going to be liked my everybody... keep your close friends close... and watch your back when your into a new crowd...  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Talk to you all later.
