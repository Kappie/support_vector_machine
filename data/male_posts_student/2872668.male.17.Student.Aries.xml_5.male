Then I slept till high noon, tumbled out of bed, and rewatched 'She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan 2003' (Legend of Condor Heroes). Meanwhile i completely forgot abt my hp....turned it off. When i finally finished the serial with the arrival of dusk, I realised my hp had a new message from her. 'Sebas?' That was wat it said. She must have asked to do somethin in the morn, but i didnt receive it. So when i asked her wat it was, she said it didnt matter any more...  Out of the blue, she mesg me to ask if she could call me then...then she suddenly changed her mind n said she'll call me tom., 'if not we'll be talkin till sunrise.' I'm sure...ha. Then she asked if i'll be home ard 12pm tmr. I said no...and she stopped messagin me altogether. I was wonderin wat to do...was I supposed to call her?
