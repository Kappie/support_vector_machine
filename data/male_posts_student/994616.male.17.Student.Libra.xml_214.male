I know everyone's over me steve babble, but you're going to have to take two more posts of it, at a minimum. Now when I set off to write this post, I wanted to make it beautiful, descriptive and sexy. Then I remembered it was two AM, and what I create at two am and think is beautiful, looks like a drunk lumbering beefalo that's rolled around in glue, tar and a box of discarded meat. (how's that for graphic?) Ok now that you've had that mental image, time to juxtapose it with The Steve. You're standing there, and you see him walk out of the bar, but you're on the phone to you can't say anything. Whe you ge toff the phone you tunr to your best friend and go "Oh My God THAT was STEVE" then you stare at him for a few seconds before realising he's coming back. You gather you courage and manage to say the single coolest line in the world "Hey Steve". You have been thinking about him for an hour a day, being awestruck at his beauty, and general coolness. He, doesnt remember you. That's ok though, because th eonly time you talked to him he was off his nut. As you talk to him you study his features. Pale blue eyes, perfect nose, dark hair 5 o'clock shadow (on a tagent why does the word o'clock even exist? It's the stupedest word in the world, it has an apostrophe as the second symbol, rather than second last. Did they think they were being ironic by doing it backwards? or maybe it was cool back then) a perfectly trimmedgoatee, sitting on a perfect jaw just above perfect pecs covered by an armani shirt (how sexy is money? just kidding) You say hi, and shake hands, you talk for a while, and shake hande, you talk a bit longer, shake hands you give him your cell number, you scream in your head, say see ya , shake hands, talki a bit longer, shake hands, then part ways. Wow Oh yeah, and there were topless male models...but STEVE!!!! steve steve steve steve steve steve steve!!!!!
