Dai Kai Sen!”  Tai Wu, “What in the world…?”  In just a flashing moment, Karean has moved and is now standing behind the scarecrow with her right hand bent forward while the left hand is totally stretched to the back this time.  Tai Wu, “What just happened?” he exclaimed.  Suddenly, the scarecrow’s whole body broke into half…falling to the ground with a large ‘crank!’ sound. Examining the scarecrow, Tai Wu realized that it’s not made of grass and straws…instead it’s made of many metal strips stuffed in it, cutting it into half would not be easy…yet Karean just did it with a sudden movement which eludes the eye.  Karean, “Pant…I’ve never like using that skill…it uses up too much energy.”  Tai Wu, “What did you just do?”  Karean, “This is Sen-Arashi, the current most powerful skill in this world.”All of a sudden, a silence click rang through the tunnel.Karean, “Ok, the lock is opened, let’s go in.”  Approaching the giant door, Karean push the door with ease…creaking sound of the joints indicated it.  Karean, “Haha, welcome to my room” She said smilingly. Next, she just walked into the room. “What are you waiting for? Come in.”  Tai Wu, “…Ok”  Moving through the door, a majestic seek soon welcomed Tai Wu. The whole room is made up of raw stonewalls with several sword traces and cuts on it. Sitting in the right corner is a big sized bed with pink covers and a drawer sitting while in the other is a small stool and table. There would just too little furniture to find in the room; overall…the whole room gave a very empty sight. A small window sat at the top corners of the room, giving off just minimum light and air.  Karean, “So how? What do you think of my room?”  Tai Wu, “Uhm…It’s big…hehehe” he spoke…the laugh didn’t seem convincing.  Karean, “Big…it’s too big! In my hometown, my room is just the size of one-fifth of this room. No televisions, radio…it’s pure boredom staying here.”  Tai Wu, “Televisions? Radio?”  Karean, “Oh…haha, well you’ll see it soon enough when we get to the town areas.”  Tai Wu, “Right…”   Karean, “Ok, I’ll start with the question…Are you hungry?”  Tai Wu, “Wha?…I haven’t eaten in days…”  Karean, “Poor guy…” She opened the drawers, took out a strange looking box and threw it towards Tai Wu.  Tai Wu, “What’s this?”  Karean, “In my hometown, we call this compressed food, various nutrients are squeezed into the biscuits inside…one biscuit can survive you for about one day.”  Tai Wu opened the box…inside are just small yellow biscuits and it looked rather plain.  Tai Wu, “ One of this can survive me for a day? You must be kidding.”  Karean, “Hah, don’t look down at the power of science and technology of year 2500. Try eating more than three of this, you’ll feel bloated.” She challenged proudly.  Tai Wu, “Year 2500?! You live in that time period?!” As he said that, he tasted the biscuits, its much more tastier than the biscuits of his time.  Karean, “Yeah, I can be said to be your ‘descendent’. In that time, people has already developed space travel and Mars is our second home planet.”  Tai Wu, “Space travel?? Mars??”  Karean, “…I’ll elaborate on all those, lucky I’ve learned on ancient history…”  With this, Karean began explaining of the whole history from the past to the future…it intrigued Tai Wu a lot…the development of guns, story of space and many others…  Tai Wu, “So…so much has happened…”  Next, Karean began on explaining the origins of her life. In the future, there weren’t much space for development anymore…therefore most landed property were mortgaged and high rise buildings grew in all countries. As for fuel, Scientist had developed a way to harness the burning of Hydrogen and thus fossil fuels were being kept and preserved. Science progressed at an amazing rate, and new inventions and discoveries like ‘compressed food’ and ‘Super Antibody’ was gradually created. However, crime rate grew at an overall high as the standards of life was much higher, also more destructive weapons were created and small scale wars broke out almost every month…the whole place is just chaotic.  Karean, “Sigh…well, stop talking the future. You sure have many questions now don’t you?”  Tai Wu, “…yes. What exactly is this place we are at now?”  Karean, “Well…to say truthfully, this is beyond my knowledge. This place seems to adopt the cultures of three major periods, the past, which is your time, the mid past, or mid future for you, which are around the 1990s, and my period. There seems to be no government, but instead the people around here with their own similar beliefs rule it. Altogether there is five different type of thinking and they’re labeled as; Gold, Fire, Water, Earth and Wood at each different positions of; North South East West and Central.”  Tai Wu, “This is almost identical to the five elements we practice!”  Karean, “Yeah, I’ve noticed as well…but there seem to be no link between this two sets.”  Tai Wu, “…then what’s the deal that some people carries swords and what exactly is ‘Fire Wielder competition’?”  Karean, “This is the part whereby we have to complete.”  Tai Wu, “Huh?”  Karean, “To return back to our original world, we have to win the respective competition we all have, Fire Wielder, Earthly Mortals, Water Hunters, Lightning Strikers and Natural Champions. I win the ‘Earthly Mortals’ competition while you stand victorious for the ‘Fire Wielder’ competition.”  Tai Wu, “What’s the reason behind all these?”  Karean, “There will be three more people from other time and world in this place now, and as you’ve guessed, they are the ‘Water Seekers’, ‘Lightning Strikers’ and ‘Natural Champions’. We have to seek them out and relate to them the whole deal, I’ve spent the whole week looking for them and I’ve only found you.”  Tai Wu, “Hmm…I get the whole picture now…so to return to our world, the five of us have to win our competitions… “  Karean, “Precisely…”
