So anyways, we arrive at Silver City and buy our tickets, and have like an hour to kill. So we go over to Starbucks. I have a new love, and her name is Espresso.....Well, more like Cafe Americano. So I buy a Grande Cafe Americano. I take one sip and love it. So later I bought another one, and the guy so rudely told me "Thats just espresso and water" and I look at him and say "I know". Bloody hell. What does he think I am, an uncultured swine? I know about coffee. I know what a cafe americano consists of! I am not J****! And now, I am actually sleepy! I am going to bed after this blog post (and one about the movie of course). Starbucks.....
