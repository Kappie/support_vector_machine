In other news, section leaders, drum majors, band council members, and the concept/music of next years show were announced tonight. Jack McCarthy is now a drum major, which is a complete shock and joy. The trumpets will now be able to run the band through a puppet regime! The tyrannical reign of John Trippy is now officially over with the crowning of Natalie Perry, Becky Boruff, and Georgia Kuss as our new section leaders. Alice is also now a flute section leader. No one else knows the other section leaders. Our show next year will be completely awesome, but apparently I am not allowed to share with you what its concept is. I shall tell you all at a later time. On further note, school is almost over huzzah!! Congratulations to Marten, Jonah, and Nathan for all making Jeckyll and Hyde! By the time you read this, I will be 16! Finally.... I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
