I would like to make it known that I now see the errors of my ways and plan on seeking treatment in an attempt to disuade myself from responding in the previous fashion henceforth. I know that I can't take back what I've already done, but let us all hope that it never happens again. Let us all learn from this mistake. People, Iemplore you... Read the instructions before you sign your John Hancock. Or in matters of Lenny's game, your abungas.
