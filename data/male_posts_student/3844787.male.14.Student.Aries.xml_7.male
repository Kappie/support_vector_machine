Anyways back too business, well, i enjeyed having James around, other than the fact that i got him banned from Msgplus!! I found it quite amusing this morning. Last night we went too my aunties house and stood in a shop reading Magazines, until of course we went toTesco's with my parents for some reason, so we hada lot of fun with trolleys, electric wheel chairs and freezers, its better than it sounds, although i stood on my jeans and now there is a rip up the back of its right trouser leg, which means i need too spend more money on clothes!! How interesting! So we spent all night on the PC and at 12:30am, we went into my lounge and watch starsky and hutch!!! It was quite a good film.   This morning we woke up, James was turning the tv on!! The bastard.. he woke me up! Then we went on the pc for 10 minutes and he went downstairs and turned on 'xXx', so we watched that for an hour and 40 minutes, then of course, I went on the PC, and i looked out of my window at him skating, it was quite amusing throwing stuff at him while he was ollying around on my patio!   Hopefully, I should be getting one new game a week, unless of course i need too save my money for such luxury's as CLOTHES!!! I'm not quite sure why i got a blog, i've been branded hippocritica by some people, but who can blame them! After all, i am the one that said I hated them!! Look !!!! You can see how lame I am! urlLink http://msgplus.mybboard.com/showthread.php?tid=28725page=1 !! How strange! I'm not sure why i changed my opinion on blogs so fast! Its just wierd i suppose!   Anyway, I'm out, see you!
