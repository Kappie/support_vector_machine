It's easily one of the world's most electrifying rivalries today, the prospect of which never fails to make basketball fans across the world salivate lustfully. Delving into the annals of history, it is quite difficult to find pairings of such comparable magnitude and consequence. One has to search back to classical times to find an equivalent event, like the Greeks with their thousand ships defeating the Trojans after a ten-year siege. With presidents, you have the pivotal Nixon vs. Kennedy debates. One could even go out on a very trendy limb to incorporate modern literature and count Harry Potter whipping the undead behind of Lord Voldemort as a similar rivalry. And now in the National Basketball Association, the home of dozens of legendary one-on-one battles over the years, we have a budding rivalry between superstar guards too good for college: Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant. However, looking objectively at their backgrounds, considerable accomplishments and obscene talent, it is quite clear that the man known simply as T-Mac in sports circles is more deserving of greatness.  All true legends have to start from somewhere, and even at childhood, Kobe Bryant seemed to have had a prescient knowledge that he would someday end up in the ranks of the true basketball greats. Born on August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bryant -- named after a Japanese steakhouse in his hometown -- inherited his amazing athletic propensity from his father and star point guard "Jellybean" Joe Bryant. Naturally, a confident Kobe was declaring himself a future NBA star at the wizened old age of three; unfortunately, Bryant's father could not find his niche in said league, and he ended up lugging his family to Italy to play. Throughout this trying experience, young Kobe was unfazed, still watching NBA games with a passion and latching himself onto the mesmerizing Los Angeles Laker point guard Magic Johnson, whose team Kobe would anoint as his favorite. This would inspire him to fervently study moves and techniques of his rejuvenated father and of NBA tapes sent from his grandparents, all bundled with Joe's patient advice at no extra charge. In 1992, Joe finally decided to retire and return the family to Philadelphia. While the reserved Kobe seamlessly integrated onto the varsity basketball team of Lower Merion High School -- 31.1 points per game, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists, all the while managing a B average -- his years of quiet solitude in Italy left him completely nonplussed in terms of dealing with American teenagers. No matter how hard he tried to become just an ordinary kid, his aloofness would prove to be an Achilles heel of sorts for him later in his career. Nevertheless, not even the coolly assured Bryant could contemplate the impact his future career would bring to basketball.  In contrast to Bryant's introverted personality, the tall, lanky Tracy McGrady found it nearly second nature to "keep it real," easily juggling his sports demands with friends and a highly loving family. Born on May 24, 1979 in Bartow, Florida, McGrady -- who had to move to nearby Auburndale with his grandmother because his young mom couldn't afford to single-handedly care for him -- actually found himself first drawn to baseball, where he wowed onlookers with blazing fastballs and bat speed. However, with the meteoric rise of the University of Memphis phenom Anfernee Hardaway, a flashy rookie point guard on the hometown Orlando Magic, McGrady was inspired to take his fleeting enjoyment of roundball to a new plateau. With this new goal firmly entrenched in his mind, his game witnessed a stunning explosion -- 23 points, 12 rebounds per game -- yet he couldn't transfer this passion off the court, where he was vilified as a habitually lazy student who would skip classes. (Indeed, like Bryant's sheltered childhood, this would turn out to be McGrady's ultimate shortcoming.) To drill this indolence out of the boy, his high school coach directed him to attend Mt. Zion Christian Academy in North Carolina -- touted as a highly successful boot camp for basketball stars -- for his senior year. It immediately paid dividends, as McGrady earned a reputation as a transcendent phenom (27.5 points per game, 8.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists) and lockdown defensive stopper (2.7 steals). With the body of a small forward, explosiveness of a shooting guard and court vision of a point guard, T-Mac's unstoppable talent would soon be put to a real test.  However, McGrady would have to wait for his opportunity to play with the big boys as the older Kobe Bryant was the first of the two prodigies to declare for the National Basketball Association. After a few deals and haggling on Draft Day 1996, Kobe found himself on the organization of his dreams -- in Hollywood, with the Los Angeles Lakers. Expectations were soaring for the "next Michael Jordan," and although he experienced a lackluster rookie campaign, his sophomore year saw him bringing contagious energy and double-digit points off the bench as the sixth man. Though rewarded with a starting position in the All-Star Game, his near-legendary aloofness reared its immature head as Bryant played one on five with the ball glued to his hand -- he was subsequently benched in the fourth quarter. So in the summer of 1999, to simultaneously rein in and unleash this burgeoning star's near-limitless potential, Los Angeles brought in legendary head coach Phil Jackson. Bryant immediately responded, exhibiting his newly-acquired defensive footwork and improved shot selection allowed by the free-moving triangle offense to help lead the team to an NBA Championship. Yet despite his amazing success -- two more league championships and murmurs of a growing dynasty -- Kobe continued to display his selfish tendencies on the court and trademark reserve off the court. A staple of his style of basketball, he would often be found forcing shots when teammates had wide open looks at the basket; he would practice alone, taking nearly a thousand jumpers a day; while his teammates were dressing and socializing before games, he would often be found in a corner silently bopping to music. Perhaps this was the downfall of his that led to his infamous Denver hotel stay and allegations of a sexual attack on a female employee -- could it be possible he had simply not learned how to handle this situation? Regardless of this outcome, Bryant has already had an illustrious NBA career, all the while winning legions of fans with his quiet demeanor and confident -- if somewhat arrogant -- game. However, another question continues to dog him -- how would he have fared without Jackson as a mentor and 340-pound Shaquille O'Neal as another threat?  Tracy McGrady's career launched from a much different, less Disney-esque path than Bryant's, as he was drafted on 1997 by a team he felt little connection with -- the brand-spanking-new Toronto Raptors. Unfortunately, as the injury-plagued team tanked in that regular season, so did McGrady's reputation -- Coach Darrell Walker was wholly unimpressed with McGrady's apparent lethargy, and as such rarely allowed his bench seat to cool. However, with their horrendous winning percentage came a coaching change; the new head honcho Butch Carter treated Tracy with the realistic discipline he needed, and the rookie started heading into practices with fire in his eyes. With McGrady gaining fifteen pounds of muscle, the Raptors' next two years were minor successes as the sophomore's scoring and defensive energy off the bench had risen tremendously. Highly desired as a free agent, he returned home to the Orlando Magic, where coach Doc Rivers promised to build a winning franchise around incoming superstar Grant Hill with Tracy as a sidekick. A season-ending ankle injury to Hill, however, forced McGrady to shoulder the burden alone, and he performed admirably, ultimately becoming the year's Most Improved Player. In subsequent years, T-Mac blossomed into a bona fide superstar, carrying Orlando to the playoffs three straight years nearly single-handedly (whereas Bryant's opponents were slightly distracted by O'Neal, a known initiator of solar eclipses) all the while showcasing a timing and affinity for passes that eclipsed Bryant. Through the years of exhaustive work, McGrady has never forgotten to reach out to the community -- especially children -- as he has donated extensive and unheralded amounts of time and money to adolescents in need in south Florida. While he currently exhibits a much-maligned laziness on defense as a result of being the only threat on the Orlando offense, T-Mac nonetheless has displayed the awesome talent, leadership ability, and humility cementing his status as a marquee player in the Association.   Quickly glossing over this post, one may have skipped over some vital differences in the histories of these two fiery young NBA superstars. While Kobe Bryant was born in the relative lap of basketball luxury, Tracy McGrady grew up with his struggling grandmother. While Kobe Bryant enjoyed personal mentoring from his father on all aspects of the game, Tracy McGrady was sent to a basketball school hundreds of miles from home. While Kobe Bryant had the stunning fortune to be coached by dynasty-creator Phil Jackson and teamed with mammoth center Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady was forced to make do with a second-year coach and literally no second scorer to divert attention. Yet, Tracy McGrady has led the league in scoring for two years in a row, and consistently leads his team in assists, steals, rebounds and three-point field-goal percentage. All of these accomplishments are accompanied by McGrady's loyalty to disadvantaged and directionless children in Orlando, as he never fails to bring smiles to their faces notwithstanding his fortunes on the hardwood floor. While Kobe Bryant may one day have to mull over his discomfort with life's temptations from the county jail, T-Mac has the lure of walking in Anfernee Hardaway's footsteps to credit for becoming possibly the greatest second fiddle in league history.
