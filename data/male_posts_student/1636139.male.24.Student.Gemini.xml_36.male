Kirill rolled down the window  fired an appropriately worded threat in the guy's direction but he proved incapable of responding with anything more than the verbal equivalent of his previously displayed gesture. 
  
During our weekly groceery trip on the way back from the gym, the cash register crashed while the clerk was weighing some of the produce I'd picked up. 
It was the 1st time I've ever seen a cash register rebooted. The device had a Phoenix BIOS so I guess it was powered by an x86 CPU, although it booted off the network  didn't run any OS I recognized.
