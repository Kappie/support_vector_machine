So when me and johnny got there ( he gave e the ride over there ) they were waiting at the disney store for us. then they said " we'll be right back " so we waited about 15 minutes for them to return. when they finally did we asked where they had gone.  they told us two that they went to go look for guys. . . . .excuse me? not only does that make a guy feel inadeqate, but what a stupid reason to go off and basically just ditch us.  well, me and johnny ( being the forgiving guys we are ) let it go. we hadnt even mentioned how we felt about that so we could still have a nice day. so then they say . . . . oh, we'll be back in a minute. welll, once again , we had been stood up. this time we decided not to stay. we went to borders and i picked up the album by staind. IT KICKS ASS!! well ..... it ended up being just me and johnny watchin the movie...it was a kewl movie but it would been kewler if that crap hadnt happened. then , as the movie ended, we saw them again. i at least asked for a hug b4 they left....shirley was about to, but hen that ass that i didnt know just pulled her away.... then i felt really bad.... and now im REALLY pissed at all 3 of them. i mean, they invoited us, why ditch us? wasnt the point of that to spend time w/ us? how messed up can ppl be?
