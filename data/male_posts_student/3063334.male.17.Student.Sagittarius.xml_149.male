That double test experience must've eclipsed any academic strenuous activity you've ever accomplished in your life. I can't even imagine how I would survive because I just went home and slept.  For me, the continued stress hormone pumper is still pumping strong doses into my brain, for I have four more AP tests to go, three MORE this week......Yeah I'm begging myself that hopefully I can survive like you guys too.. And have a happy stress relieving time in English class the next two weeks!
