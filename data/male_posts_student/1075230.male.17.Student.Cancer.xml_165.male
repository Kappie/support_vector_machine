I heard that if you don't finish at least a unit every other day, they'll kick you out. That's good I guess... keeps people from procrastinating ^^ demo... hope they can handle it. For people taking normal summer school (non-Ward summer school), well... have fun too ^^    Um... all my friends are taking summer school... that sucks. I'll be left with nothing to do *yawnz* um.. stupid math work dad gives me... *looks around*   Too bad I missed the fireworks yesterday... didn't have permission to go, because it was "illegal". @-@ ah well... the party on friday was cool, and so was helping sister move houses on sunday. Plus, I'm almost done the Circle Opens quartet... just need Shatterglass! Too bad I'm like 120 out of 135... something like that. Harry Potter and the O. of the P. is 4400 out of 4600 (estimation). Just reserved it for fun, as I've finished it already. Wonder how long my sister will take to finish...   Cool new layout btw... it's nice to have some change ^^;;    ~Chronos
