No more listening to someone drone on about Hindu veiws on abortion. Or trying to figure out curvy line algebra stuff. (apart from exams and whatever but oh well)  And most importantly, no more Mr Upward. Or Ms Harrison.  Monday will be interesting. Last lessons in IT, English, French, PoGo Science AND History. So, a whole day of not really doing anything. Yay!!!  Also, I have badminton again tonight after a few weeks off, next time anyone sees me I'm gonna have new glasses, and hopefully I'll have got a pay rise.   "Into the West" is cool. LotR music with some random person singing over them (from the RotK soundtrack) and it goes really well. Has lots of quotes built into lyrics as well. Like "all will turn to silver glass" talking about hope fading, white shores and all that. Ahhhhhh.   Over in the US last night, some mixed stuff. Philly lost 4-1 to Tampa Bay at home (yay!) But Calgary lost 3-0 at home to the Sharks. (bah!) Tampa Bay - Philly game 4 is at 3pm EDT on Saturday, so for once us English NHL fans'll be able to listen live.  ONLY 2 DAYS OF SCHOOL LEFT!
