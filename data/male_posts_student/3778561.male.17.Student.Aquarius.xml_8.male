Reality TV at its finest, Now I have been watching Big Brother  seince its prmier in season 1 with my fav character Chicken Man George. Now we are into the fifth season already and the game has changed over this time. Well they have family members in it together now whats next well they have Identical twins in it and they will be switching every once and awhile to shake things up abit. Then they have to unknown family member in the game well one of them knows now! He just have not told his half sister yet! I think that this is a bad way to do things but rateings is all that really matters. Also something I can see in the near future for Big Brother will be a All Star season or a Celebrity season or maybe even a season where people from all different televison reality show come together and compete in this one super Big  Brother I dunno. Well you know there in the works for up comeing seasons for like every reality TV show. Every show does it and why shoulent thay! I personally think these are the shows that are very interesting to watch. Well for the Amazing Race this season they have a former cast member from another season of Big Brother Allison and his boy friend  Donny. They seem to argue alot thats what makes them interesting to watch. Well the only onther thing that I can talk about is I have a Strawberry Festival Committee meeting tonight and well I look forward to that. This committee gives me something to do during the summer. See I do not idol that well so this gives me something to pick away at and I like to have things to doo. And well this is also just something else to do for me during the summer months while school is out. And well who knows I might just keep thos blog going when I go back to school because I kind of enjoy journaling all of my major activities and thoughts. I also watched the movie Butterfly Effect last night that was a good movie and I suggest that you all (By you all I mean anyone if anyone that read this go and see it!) go and see it! I also had another movie called 25th hour with Edward Norton he is a fairly good actor but I did not get a chance to watch this movie. Ahhhhh well thats all that you can do. Well that is all that I have to write about today. Until my next journal!
