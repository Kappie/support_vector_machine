SAVH for short. my teacher was the one who organised the activity called 'lunch in the dark' its basically eating while in an environment of pitch blackness. though it costs a hefty price. the xperience was worth it. and boy, was it filling, like i was eating a buffet. its so dark u cant see anything at all. even right in front of ur eyes. thats y its not at sum kind of other restaurant. oh yah, the money goes to help charity. about 20 or 25 bucks cant remember. there's a mushroom soup + bread... than xcellent fish and chips.the cooks were GOOD. and those waitress are specially trained to memorise the surroundings in the 'dark'. so they can navigate. those pple working there have vision problems. mainly being only able to see straight in front of them(no wide vision). and can see sideways without turing their heads. note: this idea was from a blind pastor. with the help of a swedish restaurant.  dessert was supposed to be chocolae cake but the teacher made the change for it to be fruits. so interesting. guessing wats gonna be in ur mouth next. dun worry, everything is edible ;) than there was ice cream + 2 hersheys kisses. dun ask me got what flavour. i cant see. its all mixed. thats y. we had to pour our own drinks ourselves. in the dark, and yes, there were numerous spills. they were sticky too. than they switched on the lights and we had coffee or tea. the room was in a total mess. that was expected. we had to spread butter on bread in the dark, use the cutlery, etc... in total darkness. most pple didnt bother but used their hands like ancient ways of (cave)men. so much food, that i needed to go to the loo after tat. lolz. only one thing to say about this. to gotta try it, to experience it. no words can describe it...cant miss sumfin liddat, man. its good, really. :-)  well, i'll love to tok more, but im damn tired. now i noe wat i've been missing lastime when did nothing but shake leg at home during the holidays. i shld have did sum useful stuff yea. well thx to the almighty GOD WHOOHOO!!! bbi frenz out there :)  okay i alreadi changed the settings but the time is still screwed and its making me mad... can u pple understand the time that i post? its in 24 hour time format. juz think about it, it is(and makes sense to)  p.s can any1 tell me wat is the meaning of ---> 'w00t'  time: 2204
