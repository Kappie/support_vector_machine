I think i am either been shocked by something.. I dont know what but something.. or im stressed out... my.. my mom, she is putting way too much pressure on me, like im some sort of a fawking super teen... now every fawkin' day I get nagged about my grade, and it is starting to piss me off.. it is like  no one trusts me anymore.  I have about and will confront my teachers soon enough, I think I will go insane!    24 Season 1  I love this season of 24 cause it is the first season of 24 I have seen fully... I need the 2nd season...  I love the third season  It kicks A$$... I love it, it is the most suspensful TV show I have ever watched.  If you watch the whole season back to back, (like what I did 12 eps. 1 day, last 12 eps. the next.) and it seems like a big movie!!! O, how I love it!!!
