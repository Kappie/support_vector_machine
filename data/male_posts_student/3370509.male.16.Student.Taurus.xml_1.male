I have a test in every subject tomorrow, and most likely I will fail them all.  I cant fail English so I am really going to study.  I also have an English project due Tuesday, which I didnt start on.  I got in trouble today.  It was funny though.  8th period my English class went down to the art show.  Braulio was leaving the show and Ricky was going to go also.  A bunch of kids were out in the courtyard, so I went.  When Ms. Murphy (My English Teacher) wasnt looking, Ricky left.   A few minutes later, she noticed he was gone.  She was writing him up saying that he cut class. (Speaking of cutting, I cut 1st period today).  Brian tried to cover Ricky up by saying he was in the courtyard.  She couldnt find them there.  I go back out in the courtyard and I was like "Oh! Ricky is in the tress.  It hard to see him but hes there."  She got pissed off at me. lol.  I keep fucking forgetting melissas cd in my room.  Shit.  Dont worry babe.  Ill remember sooner or later.
