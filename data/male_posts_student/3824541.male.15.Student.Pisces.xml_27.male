(7/04)  .Scene  4th of July was putting a considerable amount of stress on me, but now that it's over I'm trying to figure out where the stress came from. Ehh ;/ I guess somethings are just like  that . In Florida our firework displays were breath-taking, but here because fireworks are illegal my parents decided not to buy any. Oh well. So, we were fireworkless. :(. In fact, up until that morning we were peopleless too. My cousin and her six-year-old showed up. I didn't spend too much time with them though.   .That night...  After my cousins left I found Jason and Mike over at Mike's. Mike's cousins were there too. A week earlier Mike and his dad drove into Indiana to buy fireworks (once again, they're illegal here). He had a great assortment of them. A few houses down from Mike also had fireworks, but they launched them in the street. Mike and his family launched theres in the backyard. Anyways, behind Mike is a woman who works for the community patrol. They don't like Mike's family. So we were there having a great time eating and setting fireworks off. Suddenly we saw a police car. Mike's parents told us all to get in the house. We followed orders. The problem was the people across the street didn't get the warning. They got a fine for $50. We waited about 10 minutes, and started again. Then it happened. For a split second a head appeared in the blinds of the community patrol woman's house. A phone was to her ear. A few minutes later, sure enough the police are back. They once again miss Mike's house. Now, the lady's head appeared a few more times in the blinds. The people who got the $50 fine were no over at Mike's backyard (Their families are friends). They were extremely drunk, and began yelling at the patrols house "Shut the fuck up." "We'll get you back." "Karma's a bitch." Stuff like that.  The police came back once more and told us just to put whatever we had left back in the garage they had gotten a complaint. Before we left Mike's dad told us that Jason, Mike, and me would clean up the fireworks in the morning.   .Characters   My cousin  - My mom's cousin Melissa.

I kinda forgot about the whole 'help Mike clean fireworks thing.' Hmm... I don't wanna type my whole day out, but I went to the Fox Valley Mall, and I bought MMBN4. My gameboy didn't work for like an hour after I bought it, and I was really pissed. I had been looking forward to that game for a month. The strange thing is that after I called Mike to apologize it started working. Voila... Karma is a bitch.
