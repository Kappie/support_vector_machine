Heard my name was crawling, Don't know what you mean. Call your name and you'll see, You'll see what I mean.  Falling through this blackness, Waking sometime soon. I can see you crying, I can feel the blame.  Heard my name was crawling, Don't know what you mean. Call your name and you'll see, You'll see what I mean.  Deathly lost and lifeless, Holding all that hurts. I see you crying, I'm not to blame!  Heard my name was crawling, I know what you mean. Call your name, yeah, you see, You know what I mean.
