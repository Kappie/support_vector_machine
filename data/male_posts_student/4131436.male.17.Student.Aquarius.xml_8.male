I don't know how I got a distinction for my oral.. All I did was talk crap to the invigilators.. Hahaha! Guess they buy it! No matter.. Even though I got 4.. Which many of my friends said it's already a "good" grade... It doesn't to me.. I'm re-taking my MT paper.. Which is in November.. Well.. Wish me luck!! Hehehe! Hmm.. Nothing much happenings today.. Jenni never talk even though we smiled.. But Cheryl smiled a lot at me.. Hehe! *sIgHzZ* Nashir got 5 for his MT.. He'll be re-taking too.. Wish him the best too... Back to what I'm saying.. Right now.. I prefer to stay 'ALONE'.. Like what Janice adviced me last night.. Hehe! She's a cool girl.. Not into her though.. Just friends.. Sammie today like bad mood.. Dunno why.. Hahaha! It's ok.. She'll get over it.. Did S.S test today on Philippines and China.. Manage to do it.. Dunno whether I got it all perfect.. Wahahaha!! Maybe not..! :P Still.. After a day at school today.. It's very exhausting and tiring.. Hehe! Kept thinking of Cheryl's smile... Wahahahahahha! What a big laugh! But really.. She got a nice smile.. It's a compliment!! PEACE OUT!!
