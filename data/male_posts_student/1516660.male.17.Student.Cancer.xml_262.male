The girls backed out all of a sudden, and only left me, Ji and WQ to eat breakfast. WQ woke up at 7 (when I called), that lazy pig. Me and Ji finished our breakfast and he didn't get to eat at all, because we have to rush off to meet SL.  SL, WT and PY turned out to be 15 minutes late. HaHa. We waited outside the Hall for them, but we met them outside the school lor. We went to the gallery to watch (and was joined by lotsa Sec5s and 4s. They were terribly rude!) the performance. They was this dragon dance that went on for ages, but exciting too. The choir sang two songs. The first song was relatively unknown, but it was well-sung. The second song, Da Di Hui Chun, was very fast. I think they were too nervous liao. Cannot blame them la. After watching a few more dances, we went down to meet our teachers.  We first met Mrs Chua. HaHa. She invited us to her house to bai nian (actually, we siggested first, but she welcomed us all the same. HeHe). We are going this Sat. We then listened to the teachers singing. Mdm Huang was too high-pitched, and loud. She spoilt the songs. HaHa. Seriously!! Oh oh!! The Mr Kok was dressed up as the God Of Fortune and distributing (throwing, more like) chocolate coins around. HaHa. He came right to us and gave us the chocolate frogs. The juniors were all looking at us jealously. HaHaHa!   After that, we went to look for Mrs Jalil. Did you know she's pregnant? I sure don't. Ji told me she's about a month of so. No wonder la, can't tell ma. She was as friendly as ever. Mrs Tan and Mrs Chua joined us. HaHa. Mrs Tan kept telling us to come back for the Fiesta. Gurmit Singh is coming you know! Coolies! I said that we will sure come back one--to dunk the teachers! Muhahaha! We stayed on to chat more, then we left le. We (with the exception of SL and WT) walked towards Sembawang MRT and took the train towards Causeway.  We ate lunch there. I ate the mian fen guo. soon, HM and Gloria joined us for lunch, coming back from YJ. They then went to play pool, which I totally not intrested in (and have no money either). I went to look for Amanda and Wendy to wish them a happe new year and went back home.  I surfed the Net and played some games until Mother came back from work. HaHa. Some customers tried to come in after 7, but Mother refuse to let them come in ("They complain la, but we heck care! If they come in like that, how can we go back to eat dinner?"). Good job! We finally started on our reunion dinner, steamboat! It was a hearty dinner! Delicious!! Good good! Long time never eat le! The feast ended off with the drinking of sparkling cocktail.   We watched the movie on Channel 8, I went to bath and here I am (see...no tada today!)...online. Tada! (HaHa...I can't resist! :P) I found a new HP Interactive Site, MuggleNet Interactive. The site is so welcoming...and this time, I am actually using myself as the character (not a female one like Storm....hmmmmm). It looks real fun, and I bet I am gonna have fun. :)  Alright, I gotta end this le. I got a lot of things to do (mainly games playing) before going to to play with my neighbors. See ya tomorrow! Gong Xi Fa Cai, blog!
