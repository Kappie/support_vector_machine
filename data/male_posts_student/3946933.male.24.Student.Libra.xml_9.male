Cloudscape (that IBM has just released to the Apache SF):    There are several technical aspects that differentiate Cloudscape from other database systems:        Cloudscape is easy to administer. When embedded in a client application, a Cloudscape system requires no administrative intervention.       Cloudscape is embeddable. Applications can embed the Database Management System (DBMS) engine in the application process, eliminating the need to manage a separate database process or service.       Cloudscape can run as a separate process, using the Network Server framework or a server framework of your choice.       Cloudscape is a pure Java class library: This is important to Java developers who are trying to maintain the advantages of Java technology, such as platform independence, ease of configuration, and ease of installation.       Cloudscape needs no proprietary Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Written entirely in the Java language, it runs with any certified JVM.       The Cloudscape DBMS engine is lightweight. It is about 2MB of class files, and it uses as little as 4MB of Java heap.       Cloudscape provides the ability to write stored procedures and functions in Java that can run in any tier of an application. Cloudscape does not have a proprietary stored procedure language; it uses JDBC.
