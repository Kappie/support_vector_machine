Yeah, I think if too many people read this stuff, which I doubt they do (I keep all the good stuff in the middle, anyways ~_^ ), it might just cause the universe to implode. And we wouldn't want that, now, would we? or  would  we (ô_o)? It's been quiet around here lately. Just birds chirping and me eating. Yes, oh how I do love to eat. Summer reading has been coming along nicely, that is to say, not at all. Do you think I'm antisocial for not wanting to go out much? Maybe a recluse, but not antisocial. Wait. That doesn't make any sense (XD). Anyways, I do love talking to people, but when I'm feeling tired, I don't like to go out. Some times I expend so much energy during the day, the time meant for fun usually gets deposited into the bank of relaxation. I don't think I could go an entire day without talking, even just in my head. I need interaction, though. I feed off of that energy. It's what keeps me going. Otherwise, I don't know... what it is about socializing that I like so much. Perhaps because I can't stand not talking even just idle chit-chat or small talk. Or maybe I just need to get things off my mind sometimes. I know it likes to overflow, as you may have seen, and so letting out the dam a little bit every now and then maintains my sanity.  _It's a beautiful day, today. Too bad it's so damned hot. Is it wrong to wear sweaters on hot days? I have to keep explaining to people that it's not the hot air that bothers me, it's the sun's burning light that I don't like (vampire. lol). I don't care too much for any heat in the first place, but at least with just hot air, I can drink water or something. When the sun's beaming down on you, there's not much you can do except sunscreen or sunblock and shade. Shade isn't exactly available all the time; so, I guess the best thing to do would be to wear something to cover, not necessarily thick, but covering. The people in the desert do it (>_ _Super powers. I guess I thought of them 'cuz Comic-Con is happening soon, but anyways.... If I were to ever have superhuman powers, it would have to be telekinesis. Telekinesis ROCKS MY SOCKS! You know, like Jean Grey from X-Men? Moving things with your mind? The only reason why, is because I'm lazy and would rather have things come to me (XP). But yeah, I wouldn't try out that whole Spider-Man bit, where I have to save everyone's asses, and I wouldn't be an evil villain either. What would I do with them, I wonder? Probably just use them for my convenience. Hell, it would save a lot of money for traveling, and I could fly. Oh that would be so cool. And there would be no limit to "strength." You know, how like, Superman, sure he's strong, but there is a stopping point. Mental abilities, however, are abstract and far-reaching. Booyah! I might like telepathy, but if it wasn't included in the package, I wouldn't care much. Like, you could accidentally, connect with someone when they're on the toilet, doing the dirty deed, or hear something you might not like or misconstrue. And with telekinesis, I could get more things done at once. I could type up an essay, eat, draw, and wash the dishes all at once. I would also hope that other people could be telekinetic too, so I wouldn't be all sticking-out and people wouldn't get mad at me for not stopping a plummeting airplane because I wanted to watch "I Love the 2000's Strikes Back." Ahh, that would be so nice. But stopping to consider if ever super powers came into existence, I wonder: what would come first? the hero? or the villain? I imagine villainy would be a popular initial choice since other people would have a hard time stopping you, and being a super hero would come with so many complications. I'm sure no one imagines themselves as evil, but I know there are people who would definitely take advantage of any kind of power above another to get what they wanted. At some point, super heroes probably wouldn't even be needed were there no super villains. I mean, there are accidents and disasters, but a person, even a super hero, would have limitations. Having those kinds of superhuman abilities would attract too much attention as a hero or villain, which is why I would try to obscure mine as much as possible. *And yes, I realize that I am a total nerd for talking about this, but hey, I think about it, and this is  my  blog; so I'll do whatever I damn-well want, damnit! (>_ _Wishes. Of course, I would wish for telekinesis. The point of this paragraph has to do with that hypothetical situation where someone is offered a wish and they goof it up by saying it too vaguely. I thought I'd compose exactly what and how I would verbalize mine. *clears throat*:  Before the wish is granted, all of these words should be taken into consideration for the wish. Under no circumstances is my wish itself and not including its resulting products (as the products should have influence once manifested) to affect the universe in any way, except for the wish's subject in question, which is myself. However, this does not include any external or internal alterations that might change my being. The latter means that my body and mind should not require change in order to assume the wish's product. With that said, "I wish for unlimited telekinesis." I should be able to control all aspects of said wish at all times and possess knowledge and skill over how to use the abilities gained. The term "unlimited" in the wish itself should be defined as the impossibility of another force to resist it and for the powers to remain within me as long as I so shall live. And that's it. Why are you looking at me like that? That's just how I would go about making a wish. yeah. sure. I'm crazy, fine, whatever (¬_¬).  _Yeah, I realize this is a long entry, but I don't wanna forget anything. Anyways, one more thing before I go. About this blog itself. Do I necessarily retain any responsibility to it? I mean, yes, I committed myself to it, but no one really reads it. I guess the purpose for it, is so I can look back on how stupid I was. I do that a lot. I don't tend to forget my bad mistakes or instances of embarrassment so easily, and they'll come back and haunt me at random. Then I'll proceed to slap myself for ever doing whatever I did. But yeah, I get progressively dumber as time goes backwards. This thing though. What is it for? I don't really share it with anyone, and no one goes through blog archives to read EVERYTHING. Not much I have to say is really of any importance anyways. Hm... I guess, once the school year starts. I'll just use this for whenever I feel like it or just small day-to-day entries. Boy that was long. okay, buh-bye.
