Well, first of all, my name is Robert, even though about 1-2 people are gonna be reading it.  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/random/meheadset.jpg  That's me, lighting was bad, my face isn't that grainy and colorful, really you have to believe me.  I'm so sexy in my headset. I ride small bicycles  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/riders/mexup.jpg  And snowmobile  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/random/1b.jpg   And uhh, yea. I'll post some more bullshit next time that you're not interested in next time I'm bored. Possibly in the next couple hours.  -Robert
