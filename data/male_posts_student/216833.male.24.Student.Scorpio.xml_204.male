I had to be at work at 2pm and she came along to volunteer.  I forgot our lunch so we had funyon's and coke.  Also, a few cookies that barb made.  Work was easy.  Had one mean Barn owl that wanted to kill me but I overpowered him anyway.  Today actually turned out to be pretty rad. A girl said her hands were all sweaty when she was washing the dishes.  That was odd. Another frizzie-haired blonde pulled away in a taxi from the police station in petaluma.  I wonder how her time in jail went? or her visit?
