Thought I'd share a comment I made to someone about how video games are not unlike dating. When the peeps heard I'd left Egypt, was all like "what are you doing tomorrow?", you have to try this game I'm playing. Kind of funny but that's the commitment, good games require these days. I got my first film developed, pretty huge for me who for the most part has been avoiding pictures for 15 years. Deer Lake is almost pure serenity rain or no.
