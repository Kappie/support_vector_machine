I had three pieces of french toast, and an omlet. Thats five eggs and lots of cheese and three pieces of bread and lots of surup. So my colestral is probably through the roof now. But oh well, it was good. After that, I finally got in the shower and took my shower and then got out and was ready by like 11:30. Then I ate lunch, which my dad made spaghetti which was good. After that I just kinda hung out downstairs and then my half cousins came over for a little and then they left, and I started on my project for APS that I'm never going to get done. I still have my term paper to write too. But after that, my dad took me and my brother to church at St. Vincint de Paul at 4:30 and then we went to Spiderman II at the Rave. I've been really wanting to see Spiderman II and go to the Rave so it was nice. The Rave was amazing, the arm-rests go up, the seats leen back, the seets are very nice, stadium seeting, a huge screen, and too top it all off for going to Spiderman II you get a free popcorn and soda. It's a nice theater, very worth it to go to. Spiderman II was good, it wasn't amazing like I thought it was going to be, but it was still a good movie. I had to keep going to get a drink though during the movie because I don't drink soda and the popcorn made me very thursty. There was a lot of people there too, Spiderman II was playing every half hour and our theater was crowded, so I'm guessing the other ones were too. After the movie, there was a line at our bathroom. I got in there early so I was one of the first ones, but I've never seen a line at a guys bathroom, but I have today. That's how crowded it was. After the movie, we went over to that new American store. We looked at the digital cameras because I want one, my dad said I could probably get one for Christmas, so that's good. Then we just looked around at other stuff and sat on the massage chairs, you have to love those. I could just sit in there all day on those. It was nice. But sadly it was raining outside, because we were gonna go watch the East Peoria fireworks but, they got postponed till Monday because of the rain. It's suppose to rain tomorrow to. That's not cool at all. I am going over to my cousins in my Brimfield around 1:00. So hopefully its not raining then, for I can ride the gator and stuff or jump on the trampoline or go swimming. After that I'm gonna try to go to Eureka with Amanda, Nat, Whitney, Kacy, Andrew, for the fireworks and a thing for Amanda and Andrew's church. But I don't know if I will be able to yet. Well I'm tired. See-ya! Have a happy 4th of July!
