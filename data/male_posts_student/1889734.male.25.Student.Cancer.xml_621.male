I didn't really feel like I was wearing it, and my motions were much more natural.  I have to do something about the skates though.  Two years ago when I started playing in Peachtree City, I bought a nice pair of Mission blades, but for some reason, I purchased size 10 when I normally wear size 11.  By the time I questioned why I was experiencing so much pain, it was too late to return them.  I'm soldiering on with them now, but it can't go on without me ending up crippled.  The session went very well this time.  I managed about 75 minutes of play without taking a break, and most of that was pretty vigorous action.  I had a few dumb moments, like missing the puck completely when it rolled in on me as I tried to shoot it to a defensemen.  An another occasion, I missed a poke check by about ten feet and laid there like a beached whale while the guy stepped over me and shot into the empty net.  But I had some great moments too.  Some nice lateral saves.  Some very nice glove work that surprised even me.  I think I'm gaining some respect there, and I had at least two people arguing over which team I would be assigned to play on (they both wanted me).  So I think this is going to be a fun place to play provided the turnout improves.  Another session tonight, so I'll provide another short report tomorrow.
