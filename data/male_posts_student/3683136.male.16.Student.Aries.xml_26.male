I spent a bunch of time with Gareth, we went to the beach which was lots of fun and played on the awesome (and dangerous) new playground at Tower.  Then we headed over to the Fireworks.  They were a lot of fun.  We met up with Katie and Sarah, and we all went to the beach.  Sarah and I walked aways down the beach, and had interesting conversations.  I love the beach, it's the only place where I have really good conversations.  It's kind of odd.  I guess it's a nature thing.  I'm happy because despite my disagreement with Sarah's whole not telling shit bit, we still have good conversations about everything.  We talked a lot about simon and Sam, and about my ridiculous crush, and whether or not bisexuality exists and all that.  I should spend more time at the beach.  -Mike  "Make a whole with a gun perpendicular, to the name of this town in a desktop globe, exit wound in a foreign nation, marking the home of the one this was written for."
