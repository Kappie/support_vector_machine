Separatists have been fighting pro-Moscow forces in Chechnya for most of the past decade. The current war began in October 1999 as an intended quick Russian military operation that has unexpectedly met by stiff Chechen resistance.  It has since dissolved into a guerrilla war that continues to claim lives on both sides of the conflict on a nearly daily basis." -  urlLink Aljazeera       I feel bad for being so ignorant on the matter. I've known of war and death in the region, but nothing about the details. It's strange that this kind of violence and turmoil occurs on the streets every day in some places and goes largely unnoticed in our society, even in the days of advanced technology. No amount of technology makes up for bad journalism or a lack of compassion for people, even if they are total strangers. Really, the two must go hand in hand. Is that why Fisk and Pilger are so good? Is that why our school textbooks don't read like Zinn? Why must everything be a commodity? It makes the real world seem so fake. The mainstream media doesn't care about the people that make their stories happen, they're just selling copies.
