Once, long ago, i held it in my hand...  i still can't believe i was so young when i found it. i was just a small child wandering lost, surrounded by people i didn't know. i was lost and confused and...i saw something in the distance that caught my eye. i walked over and took a closer look...and there i beheld the greatest gift this earth has to offer.  Ultima.  i held it in my hand, it was as if it WISHED to be found by me. i never let go of it, i kept it for many years. It made my life worth living.  i was walking along one day and i just...let it go. i allowed it to slip from my hand. i didn't even watch as it rolled away along the ground, i didn't care.  i had no idea what it was worth.  i didn't really understand what it was.  sure, it was nice, but i never knew just how much that thing had meant to me until i had lost it.  but i knew in my heart that it was gone.  i had lost Ultima, the most sought after prize ever spoken of in legend.   it wasn't until after i had lost it that i knew what it was.  Ultima, it has many names, men call it different things depending on their own hearts. But i know now that it has no true name. No single word or set of words can ever hope to describe it. How odd that this thing so many seek only shows itself to those who have no idea what it is.  Ultima is pure emotion.  it is no thing of matter, and yet it matters far more than all other things.  I've lost it, I've lost that dearest of prizes.  it was so many years ago, and then i began to wander. i had no thought to look for it where i had dropped it, so i simply wandered the earth, hoping that it would be around the next corner.   i wandered so long that I've forgotten my own name.  i no longer need a name.  those without hearts have no need of names.  and i have no heart, at least not a whole one. That thing had become a part of my heart, when i lost it a part of my heart was lost as well. I'll never need a name again. One as lonely as i has no one to speak to, and thus a name would be extraneous.  my wandering was fruitless...  i came to the point that i gave up all hope of ever finding it again.  and then an old woman told me one day that she had seen it and knew where it was.  i asked her where, and she pointed up at the sky...  i looked and there it was, shining brightly in the heavens, forever beyond my reach!  and yet, somehow, a theif had taken it and claimed it for his own. perhaps he is no theif, erhaps he is the rightful owner after all, but i just can't help but be jealous.  and there it is in the sky even now, and yet the clouds of time obscure it from my view. it is so rare for me to catch a glimps of that most beautifull of beauties.  i wander under that sky now, i try to follow the star that Ultima now is to me, but i am lost. the clouds hide my guide in their darkness. and so much of the time i simply wander.  i will seek it all the days of my life, i will seek it as a ghost after my death.  it has given itself to another yet it is still bound to my heart. or rather, my heart is bound to it. my wandering is filled with pain because i know that i will never agin hold it in my hand. i will never again gaze into the truest of mirrors. it is not that i will fail, it is taht i HAVE failed. i faled all those years ago when i first let it slip from my hand.  i won't let go this time.  i will hold onto it untill i am burned to death in its flames.  it made me the happiest man to ever live, now that i have lost it am am the saddest...  i was a prince once, long ago.  now i am just a wanderer...  a wanderer...  without a name.
