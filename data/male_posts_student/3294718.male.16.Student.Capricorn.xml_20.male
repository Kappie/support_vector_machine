Allin, and everyone left feeling that their Halo habit wasn't quite fed yet.   On Saturday, I woke up unusually early. I got up at 8:30, and I felt really horrible. We had plans to go down to the show later on, but first we putzed around Brainerd for a while, I called Erik a "corporate whore" for eating at McDonalds, and then we went to my moms. When Goat found out that we had been playing Halo, he foolishly boasted that him and four of his best Goat buddies could defeat me and seven of my Halo-playing companions. That's right, 5 vs. 8. Which sent me, Chris, and Erik into paroxyms of laughter, and I agreed that our team would would destroy their team at a time of our convenience. Oh, and another thing- he wouldn't talk to us. He sat there with a smug look on his countenance while my mom (he is thirty-something years old and he is having his wife challenge a bunch of kids to a video-game match) conveyed his ill-thought out challenge.   But it isn't just Halo.  It is me vs. Goat, young vs. old, right vs. wrong. I won't claim to be right 100 percent of the time we argued, but it must have been at least 99.97564 percent.   It is about the future, the next generation, knocking over the complacent who are arrogant in their age, who think that just because they are older, they know more.  We are free of the prejudices and doubts of our elders, and I intend to prove that when I pick up my S-Controller and kick the bejesus out of Team Goat. It is time for them to step aside for us.  Maybe you are reading too much into a video game, you say. Maybe I am. But anyway, here is what I am thinking for the roster: Myself Chris  Erik  John  Hobe David Miller (the alleged "Driller") Houley and one more who I haven't decided on. I'm not sure who is the next best. But some people on the list are on it because they also deserve a chance to humiliate the Goat, like the Oselands.   After the asinine challenge was handed to us, we went out back and started jumping on my sister's trampoline. She ordered us to get off, and I yelled, "We don't need your fascist trampoline anyway, Bailey!"  I'm starting to think my sister is a secret agent for Goat. Also, I like exaggerating and calling things "fascist."   After said events we hung out at Bryce's house for a few hours. That was pretty fun, I always enjoy going to Bryce's house. Bryce got the sweet guitar from Honest George that I was in love with and stupidly tipped him off to. It is really cool. I would talk about it more, but I am really bitter about it and I'm just going to try and let it go. After that, it was 'round six, and we hung out in the parking lot for a while. Nate Lucas showed up and chatted and played hackey sack with us, and then we went into the show. There was the normal scenesters there, but there were a suprising number of sophomores and TV Pro kids there too. Yeah, it might have been the first social function I've ever been to that I knew everyone. Joe's band wasn't bad. They were talented (by "they" I mean mostly Joe and Tom), but I found their music uninteresting and lacking energy. I'll just chalk that up to first-show jitters, and I'm sure that their next concert will rock 12 times as hard. Oh, and I taped the show.   After the show we went back to Bryce's place for some Halo. We were all pretty pumped at the prospect of beating Team Goat in Halo, and we played for a long time. To be specific, we played from 8:30 till 4:30 in the morning. Me and Chris and Bryce got the worst sleeping places, with me  and Chris on the floor and me using the dog piss blanket, Chris on the floor kicking me in the head in his sleep, and Bryce sleeping on top of the pool table. Erik was lucky enough to get the couch and Dustin was long asleep in Bryce's bed by the time we quit Halo. The night was really rough on the floor with Bryce's hyperactive dog stealing my pillow, Erik stepping on me in the middle of the night, and Chris kicking me in the face. I slept about 2 hours, and I am pretty tired right now.   Some random miscellaneous things:  When people use the word "tweens" it really bothers me. It is the worst word ever, because you know anything connected to it is going to suck. It also connotates that the aforementioned "tweens" will grow into teenagers, and then you better watch out, because you know teenagers! I hate being called a teenager. Being lumped in with my peers at BHS bothers me because I am so different from them. I don't suffer from their boring emo teen angst or listen to their hip-hop or speak their ebonics. I'm sure I offend them too.  Last week of school. Wow. I don't really know what to think about that. Let me just say one more thing:  ONLY THREE MORE HOURS OF FST AND CHEMISTRY, THE MOST ILL-CONCIEVED AND POINTLESS CLASSES EVER MADE! HURRAH!  Wow, that was long.
