I went to the zoo again today! i like zoos they're so much fun! but i still think it's sad that they have some of these animals in enclosures that are way to small for them. like the polar bears that just pace all day or the wolves that do the same...it's kinda sad. i wish zoos had more money to be bigger. -Matt
