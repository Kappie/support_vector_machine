Firstly, while waiting for CQ in Woodlands Interchange,I met SL. Now, SL asked me "Why haven't you made up with WQ?". Everybody's asking me this question you know! I really wonder why. Not really. I think WQ told everybody he's no longer angry at me or something.......and now everybody's asking me why I aren't friends with him. I am really confused lor. CQ told me WQ said he preferred we aren't talking, but everybody thinks otherwise. Who is right? Should I get my hopes up high? But one thing for sure, I am not gonna talk. Seriously. Yes, even though i am wrong in screaming at him, he used violence on me, and humilated me in public. That, I cannot tolerate. I hate people using violence on me (then why do you think I am actively against WWF and violent scenes?). It's his fault if you use violence you know. He could have asked nicely, without resorting to violent means. He used violence, then I screamed. Even though I could have not screamed, but I was provoked by violence. See the full story? Sigh! Not that I don't want to be friends, but I refuse to be the one to speak first. Ayiah, see things as they progress along la.   After Phy (ayioh...feel like sleeping, and she assigned us homework) and Bio (I always fail my osmosis experiment!!), we went to Causeway Point to see the cost of ingredients for making SuPing's cake. But first, me and Amanda went to shop for mooncake. So little shops selling snowskin mooncake! We finally went to Bengawan Solo to buy our mini mooncakes. I brought a mini durian snowskin mooncake, while she brought a mini baked lian yong mooncake. We ate a bite of each other's mooncake (and gave Wendy some bites too). We still preferred out own snowskin and baked versions. HaHa!   We brought the cake mix and the Hundreds and Thousands sprinkling thingy there. I paid fully for my part, and so has Wendy. So many people are paying. We are cooking in Yvonne's house on Monday, after our jigsaw fixing! HaHa!I am supposed to bring back the cake mix and spinking thingy. After buying, I went to Wendy's house to do homework (oh! Tuition tomorrow, I mean, today).   There, I completed my Physics and English homework. While doing so, I started reminicising about my friendship with Siva. I think we grew further apart these years. And I am like, very sad about this. These years, I did not interact with her very often. I always leave her for my friends.....and I feel so guilty about it. I really miss the days we walked home together from school. After choir every Sat, we would like go to Shop and Save in 883 and buy bars of chocolates. Then walked around 883. I really miss those days man! Me and Siva were like very close back then. Talk about almost everything in the world! Yep! Hmm... maybe, this is a sign of moving on? No! I certainly don't want to. Me and Siva would always be friends forever. :)  After that, we started talking about our good old days, our primary school days. I learnt quite a lot of things about Wendy...very hilarous! I feel very much like visiting Mr Shah, but I don't know where he's posted to. Hmm...must inquire from friends. Ahhh...the good old days. So much memories.  And hahaha! I keep laughing throughout the day! You see ar, while walking to her block, she was telling me that she's very disheartened, because she didn't recieve a prezzie from her angel. She said it seems like the angel doesn't care about her. Then, at her desk, I rummaged through a file! And guess what? I saw her prezzie from her Angel! I started smiling funnily. There she is, complaining about not receiving a present, and her prezzie is in her file all along! She asked me what I am smiling so crazily about. I told her "your stupidity" and refused to say more. Later on, while walking to 88 with her, I told her why I called her stupid. She was like "Really? HAHA", and she said she never checked her file. that made me wonder how long was the prezzie inside file. HaHa! The present was cute...and original! Never thought of that! Ha!  Okay, I gotta go to her house le.....see ya later tonight, blog! Bye!
