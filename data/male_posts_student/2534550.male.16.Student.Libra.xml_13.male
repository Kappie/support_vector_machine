Since a narrative has been done, random thoughts will proceed: -Seeing old faces was a lot of fun. Except for one. Cough. -I was surprised at the numbers of the hornline, namely the, umm, proportions. But seeing as how there was a sudden influx of C corps members, it is understandable. Perhaps a few kiddies will switch to smell-o-phone? -I haven't yet formed an opinion on this year's show music. I anticipate that, like last year, our ballad will be changed.... three times (?). I'm not thrilled with Chase the Clouds Away, and a former BD marcher predicted bad fortune would come of the B corps if it's not changed. I have yet to look at our opener closely.  -Reuniting with my old horn was very bittersweet. After getting more than my share of love from it, I think I'm ready to move on to a case that does not have bus tire marks. Although I did like the fact that my case matched the baris and mellos except for the minor size part.  -While I am confident that a lead position will be filled by yours truly, I was rather surprised at the lack of above-the-staff notes. Once again I hope that music might be changed (or at least that things will be different in the closer).  -I love the idea of going to Oklahoma, not only because tour will be longer but because of preliminaries and more competition and all the benefits of travel. -These DVDs do sound like a must-have. I'll get those within the next week or two.   Okay Chelsea, your turn!
