Did exchange some heated words but nothing that will actually create hatred among us... Just smsed him and told him to steer clear of me and I will too... Until I get over him and such... Lolx...  Still talking to Wan Xin and was feeling much better... Dont know why but I just love to talk to her and tell her everything... We are going out on June 3rd with Wenfong... (Knew them from my first part-time job) Really a blessing to know them. Nice girls... Friendly too.. :) Going out for? We are going to do hair... Yay!!! Finally can get rid of the ugly 'grassy' hair I had for erm... like 2 months le... It's like a long time since I meet up with them also le... Looking forward worz...  Im downloading from IRC now... Waiting so anxiously... It was a song by Toro... I didnt know he have new works until two days ago when I went to HMV and found Toro's name on one of a album where 5566 and K-One worked together... 5566 and K-One sucks like hell... Lolx... Dont really like them... Wonder what kind of song will it be... The album cover describe the song as a Hip-Hop kind of song... How nice...  Starting to feel comfortable with this blog now... So my day today actually isnt bad... I actually wake up at around 1 pm and used the computer to like now! My parents didnt even whined! What a miracle! Lolx... Was just gunbound gunbound and gunboung the whole day with Lishen and Daniel... We really dominant other people with the 'Misses' gimmick... Lolx... We will be making a reputation for ourselves soon for being so 'heel' and we were like swearing the whole time. I didnt reliase that Gunboung can be so addictive at time after you had lost interest in it... Lolx...   Before that, after I've lunch (Just plain Maggi Mee which my Mum helped to cook for me which I cant finish it, lolx...), I watch Sailormoon Live Action whcih I have already downloaded for DAYS already... A really nice show... Sailormoon always was my favourite anime beside Doraemon... I know Im childish... Lolx...  Before that (just when I just woke up)my Mum called me to go downstair and helped my parents carry somethings back home... My Dad actually bought a new Vacuum Cleaner and a new Cordless Telephone... Was so shocked! What a waste of money. I just used the cordless phone and found that it isnt very good. Maybe some cheap phone... Lolx...  A very mixed emotion day... Lolx... Got such decription de mahz?  Well, time to move on with life... School will be starting soon on June 21st and Orientation should be around 17th and 18th... Dont really care... Stupid orientation. Waste time only... Lolx...  So I gotta go sign off now. It is so late now... Got to sleep before my parents whine at me for using the comouter the whole day.   Signing off - Ronald
