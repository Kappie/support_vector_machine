After breaktime, i had a Math test, so eaaaaaasy -Thank God- and after it, a wrinting test, easier than the Math one, beacuse after the math test i met some guys of the other junior class and we traded our tests, so before the writing test begin i knew all about it.  And when i was going home i met a friend and we traded our homeworks, i gave him my litersture home work and she's gonna give me the chemistry one. Watched Friends, went to gym, took shower, thought about somethings... And here i am. Tonight i'm going to eat ice-cream, i'll try to brake the last week's record: eat more than 900g of ice- cream. Cheer for me folks!
