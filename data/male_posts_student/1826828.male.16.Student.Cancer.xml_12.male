I had no idea until today that anyone other than my close friends even knew about this rather pointless webpage, but there you are... It seems I was wrong. Go see  urlLink Eirene - R.a.v.i's blog . He's somewhat more philosophical in his blogging than I, spending time with less inane ranting and more pondering of the darkest secrets of the universe. Or, at least, something like that.   Since I now realize that someone is reading this, I'll have to make a special effort, which becomes difficult given the expected 2 weeks of isolation from civilization (it's not that bad, really).  My new phone came today. I can now say that I have tried most of the major phone producing companies, and Sony Ericsson looks to be ahead of the game, simply because that is the latest one to grace my pocket. It's a T... erm... 610. A T610, whatever that means. A reasonably priced, and yet featureful phone with  Bluetooth . Bluetooth is required because it will mean I can finally use some of the more useful features of my palmtop. Yay, yet another piece of electronics I have to carry around, but this should mean I can blog from wherever I am!  In fact, the necessity for one to carry around multiple pieces of complex electronics is one of the most irritating things I have come across. Apart from small screaming children and Dolly Partridge, of course. The fact that my palmtop is totally useless as a communications device without a suitably enabled phone, and my laptop totally useless without a suitably enabled human is a source of extreme irritation. Ah well, should have got one of those O2 PDAs then, you know, the ones that act as phones as well. Note to self - "Get bigger pockets".  I haven't done any proper programming for a few weeks, this is getting worrying, and always happens. I find some rather pointless and yet interesting project to work on, and work feverishly at that, but choose to do so at a particularly important time in my schooling. Holidays, the perfect time to pursue such interests just don't seem to come into it. I mean at some point to test the theory of my IT head, that the best code is written at about 1am.  Go learn  C++ , you know you want to. At some point expect a large ramble about why I think it is the best language under the  Golden Orb , also including, for one time only, a massive go at VB!   And, whatever you do, don't waste time downloading Opera, go for  urlLink Firefox  instead. See below for reasons why!  -- Dom Out
