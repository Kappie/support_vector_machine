Woke up, went into town with Scott, gave him present, he liked, saw Phil's daughter Cerri with Joel, bought Simon the Sorcerer, came home, washed my trombone, did some practice, went to Les Mis reunion/random workshoppy thing, talked a lot to Rhiannon and the Johnstones, played on Simon the Sorcerer, came online.  *sighs*  How do I feel after that?  I'll get back to you on that one.  Quote of the day: "California, California, You're such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed. California, California, So much to plunder that I think I'll sleep instead."  From Rufus Wainwright's   California   Love, Jon Roskilly
