I mean, not that I can't handle them, it's just that there's so much going on in such a short time.  Anyways, Something Corporate's music just makes me feel great.  And it's weird, so does she.  She doesn't even have to try, and she just brightens my day.  It's really amazing.  And these nights I get high just from breathing. When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real, like that firework over the freeway. I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel.  Amazinggggg.  That's all for now.
