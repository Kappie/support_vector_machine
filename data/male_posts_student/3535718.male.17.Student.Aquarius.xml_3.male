Our site got shut down because apparently someone found out about an upload script I had been writing and used it to upload some not-too-legal things. So here we are at blogger. I am not sure if alifedivided.com will ever become a full-out website again as it is a lot of work and blogger has a lot of nice features to it. If only I was able to create other sections with just plain html... Anyways for now this is where it is at. If blogger ever opens up it's pay thing again I will deffinatly go for that as I hate that thing above the blog just as much as you do (thank god for admuncher :D). I ordered some sweet new stuff for my computer which I will deffinatly post pictures for when I get them, it is some really sweet stuff. Well, until then take care.
