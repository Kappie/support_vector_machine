Well my parents make me work for them while they worry about me being to active.  Really to me its all just another step towards the end.  All of it is busy work, some pain, and a way to keep my mind off of things.  Life has lost a lot of point.  I have a few theories but each seem to only work up to a certain point. Another random thought is why do we have names?  I mean its a cool way to show personalities and all, but really its just a way to lable people.  if we were all just numbered wouldnt it be easier.  there would only be one 1239485.  Rather than 3 alex's and 5 davids.  so its just all so stupid.  like cold. there is no such thing scientificly speaking.  cold is what we call the lack of heat.  we just give names to describe things.   names.  something that seems so simple but aren't. Now its time to take a deeper look in life.  Everything we do is another step down a path.  We have to treat life like a race.  that gives it some point.  But between all of out problems, good times and bad times, there is just the right amout of everything.   We just dont like the amout of evil there is.  We cant do much about it though. All we can do is try to minimise it in our lives.  You cant ask for much more. Finally i'll talk about love.  Talk about an amazing thing.  An unseen power that can get us to jump off cliffs, or out windows for that matter.  We think we need it because thats what instinct tells us.  But who knows what love is anymore?  extream affection for a person?  how could that be, that could be a best friend.  i'm lost as to what it means. even the dictionary is confusing.  there are 10000 different meanings.  Heres what i think, love is what you want it to be.  i'll leave you with Mr. Webster and his opinion:   1 a (1) : strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties   (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests   b : an assurance of love
