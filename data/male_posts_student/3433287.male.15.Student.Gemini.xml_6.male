Im slowly making my way there, learning martial arts, ordering a sword, but it isnt the same, what has happened?  Where have the days gone when instead of shooting someone you battle it out with hand crafted unique blades of steel using your muscles and skills to win...not the pull of a trigger.    If anyone has a damn time machine, you better hook me up.    I do admit now a days isnt so bad, but in the ways in which i wish things are, now a days sucks ass.  We have technology, oh whop de do, fuck that shit.  I would gladly trade everything i have to go back, to the times of the old.  People these days are so fucking stuck on materialistic shit they dont even know the meaning of life....
