Last night I challenged him to a boxing match, and he accepted.    I really want to do this scavenger hunt with you guys.  I may be driving my Grandpa's old truck, just to Put miles on it before my Grandma sells it.  I like the truck and it goes pretty fast.  Also this Sunday/ Monday I think I may be at my cabin.  I got a .22 and cant wait to shoot stuff with it.  Let me know when the scavenger hunt is, if you decide to do it.  I have a car and video camera at my side.  My four songs are- Linkin Parks "Lying from you", Incubus "Megalomaniac", The Offspring "Americana", and The Blue Man Group "The Current"
