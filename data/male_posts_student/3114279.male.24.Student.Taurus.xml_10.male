      Spaceballs was a blast last night.  The place was packed.  I didn't mind that a very cute girl sat next to me and laughed with me and even ended up kind of snuggling up against me.  I'll never see her ever again I'm sure, but those sort of little fleeting moments are wonderful, even if they are only temporary.  Everything is temporary, I guess.  Very tired today, lost an hour last night due to daylight savings.
