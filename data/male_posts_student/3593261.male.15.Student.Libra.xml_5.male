"Thanksgiving and praise are due to God alone, we seek aid from Him alone; and we beseech forgiveness of our sins from Him only; and consign ourselves to the protection of God against the evils of our souls and against all offenses. Truly, whomsoever God guides on the straight path -- and He puts him only on the straight path who sincerely desires to walk along that way -- no one can lead him astray. And whomsoever God deflects -- and He deflects only him who yearns to be deflected -- no one can put him on the straight path. And I bear witness that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the bondman of God and His Messenger  "O Believers, Fear Allah, as He should be duly feared; and die not save you be Muslim" [Koranic verse]  From Usama Bin-Muhammad Bin Ladin to his brothers and sisters in the Islamic nation  God's peace, prayers, and blessings be upon you.  My message to you concerns inciting and continuing to urge for jihad to repulse the grand plots that have been hatched against our nation, especially since some of them have appeared clearly, such as the occupation of the Crusaders, with the help of the apostates, of Baghdad, the house of the caliphate, under the trick of weapons of mass destruction. There is also the fierce attempt to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque and destroy jihad and the mujahidin in beloved Palestine by employing the trick of the road map and the Geneva peace initiative.  This is in addition to the crusader media campaigns against the Islamic nation. These campaigns show how malicious are the evils they harbor against the nation in general and against the people of the two holy mosques in particular. The Americans' intentions have also become clear in statements about the need to change the beliefs, curricula, and morals of Muslims to become more tolerant, as they put it. In clearer terms, it is a religious-economic war. They want the believers to desist from worshipping God so that they can enslave them, occupy their countries, and loot their wealth. It is strange that they want to dictate democracy and Americanize our culture through their jet bombers. Therefore, what is yet to come is even more malicious and devilish. The occupation of Iraq is a link in the Zionist-Crusader chain of evil. Then comes the full occupation of the rest of the Gulf states to set the stage for controlling and dominating the whole world. For the big powers believe that the Gulf and the Gulf states are the key to controlling the world due to the presence of the largest oil reserves there.  The occupation of Baghdad is only one practical step of what the United States has thought of and planned before. The entire region was targeted in the past. It is being targeted now, and will remain so in the future.  What have we prepared for that? The Zionist-Crusader campaign on the nation today is the most dangerous and rabid ever since it threatens the entire nation, its religion, and presence. Did Bush not say that it is a Crusader war? Did he not say that the war will continue for many years and target 60 states? Is the Islamic world not around 60 states? Do you not realize this? Did they not say that they want to change the region's ideology, which vents hatred against the Americans? They mean Islam and its peak after all. They know full well that they will not enjoy our wealth and land as long as we remain mujahid Muslims. So, learn this and keep it in your mind.    One message to everyone : Osama's a sadist.
