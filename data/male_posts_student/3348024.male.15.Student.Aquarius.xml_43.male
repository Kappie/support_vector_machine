Or ethical appeal, Cold's are morally unjust and illegal.  The virus also invades private property, that being the body, but because that argument may be faulty for people such as prostitutes who invite people into their bodies, I could also say that cold's are gay and they want to get married which is illegal in most states.  That's right, bitches, I went there.  Here's some logical appeal, They're just damned annoying and they're meanie heads.  Yeah, that's right, I said it, meanie heads.
