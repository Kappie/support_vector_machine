My castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you...(edit out a few lines)  I wait my whole life, to bite the right one, then you come along, and that freaks me out, so I'm frightened... Dracula's Wedding."  I know, I haven't posted lately. I apologize. I dunno... I somehow feel like I've strayed from my mission statement. I've said a lot of meaningless shit, and not been at all insightful. So maybe I'll try and rectify that. I really feel the need right now, more than ever in my life so far, to have some kind of significant other(meaning a girlfriend, heh). In keeping with the idea i based my blog on, I guess I oughta try and figure that out...  -- 10 to 20 mins later--  OK, so all i can think of are trite things.  "I'm just coming out of my shell.", "I'm tired of being alone so much of the time", etc.  And I dunno, maybe it really is one of those things. It wouldn't become cliche if it was never true. But maybe it's something weirder. Maybe since I've had so little interaction with my mom(by comparison to most ppl), I'm feeling the need to have a prominent female figure in my life. This one might take a while to get to the bottom of.   Well, anyway, I think I'm gonna call it quits for tonights blog.  Oh, BTW, Tim, you're the man for taking that rotating cursor thing off. I didn't intend to make anyone change their stuff, but it didn't go unnoticed, and i do appreciate it. :)  Aight, latas.
