I remember one moment were she was lying down on the blanket in the sand, and her hair just light scattered across her face.  And then the sun hit her red hair so perfectly, she was the most beautiful thing in the world.  I wish i had a camera.  But i can see it so vividly in my mind.  I wish I could tell her this and it hurts sometimes when I know I cant.  She's on my mind a lot, especially at night when I cant sleep.  I've been hanging out with her a lot, and I talk to her every chance I get.  She still has no idea :(  I still can't tell her until im sure.  I just wish that day would be soon.  Dearest friend, how do i find words for what my heart desires....  Im sorry if you people dont wanna read this, thats okay, its just what im dealing with these days.  Perhaps my blogs will be better in the future....
