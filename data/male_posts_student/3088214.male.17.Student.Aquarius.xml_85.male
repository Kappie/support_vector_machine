Rob, congratulations on the longest, most well-constructed blog in the history of blogger. The current debate topic of abortion and birth-control seems to manifest a rift between morals and science. The problem now is to recognize the difference and form opinions/arguments. Chris is certainly right-on when he talks of the moral similarities between taking the morning-after pill and an abortion. However, as the morals are similar, the science and event of each are so drastically different that it separates the moral argument on a scientific level. I would say that it would be much more demoralizing for a woman, perhaps her boyfriend and parents as well, to go through a surgical abortion. If taking a pill after sex allows a girl to not have to go through with an abortion this then reduces a life-changing experience to a gulp...And a swallow. Therefore, the repercussions of each event and the moral affect that those repercussions have, separate the two.   ~Holla
