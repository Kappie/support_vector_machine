Apparently there are 3 theories to alien life (Forgive me DV, if these arent fully correct):  1. There are no aliens from other planets, They are simply humans from the future that mutated due to nuclear radiation, or evolution or what not, and they found a way to travel back in time.  2. There are aliens from other planets, somehow they found a way to travel faster than light, which would disprove Einstein's theory of relativity. So they could make it here.  3. Aliens are beings from another dimension, sort of like a parallel universe. And they found a way to break into different dimensions.  That is over course excluding if you simply dont believe in alien life at all. I'm not really sure which to believe. It sounds very interesting though.  What do you allbelieve?
