It was from an old TomServo0 I used to use in my college days and had lost the password. Whoever took it over and sent out the mail should have considered, possibly, to not E-mail another address of the guy's that he took. Don't you think? Then I wouldn't have to find out about it and shut him down. The same thing apparently happened to one of my father's addresses and when we found out and checked, there were 999 E-mails in his outbox. In conclusion, it was nice that someone actually sent me an E-mail, even if it was from myself. It made my day so much I even wrote this little letter about it. Yay! Now to Chuck for the weather.
