Then went to school...Just like normal school days... It was raining a little and the wheather was cold... There was a "Tongue Twister" competition held in our class today... It was quite competative and everyone is good... The winner falls to one of my friend in next class... I must admit she was quite good... The speed and the pronouncation was really clear...Then at 1.30pm , I came back home...I was too tired so I rest in the sofa for 15 minutes... I was asleep and dreamt about her again xD~... I was walking and talking with her on the way to a class...Then suddenly her ex came and POOF , I woke up ! It was quite a weird dream though... Maybe it is a sign I should give up...But NO , I will not... I will not let this kind of things bring me down... I must continue till the end... Then , after my lunch , I went to sleep again... I took my bath at 6.30pm and had my dinner at 7.00pm... After finished watching Malaysian Idol , I went to study until 10.00pm... I was asleep again and I woke up at 10.30pm... Luckily this time no weird dreams for me... Then I continued study until 11.00pm... I guess I got to stop here now cause it is already 11.48pm... I need to sleep and continue my study tomorrow...
