A restauRANT I told my friend Billy I'd go and eat at where he works, a new restaurant that opened yesterday in the Centa. It's called Krazy Karry's. I was really excited, because I like burgers, and my friend would be making them. The only problem I had with the KK was that it took 30 minutes to get our food. I have decided I will wait at least a month, maybe two, before I go again. I believe the problem was that the 7 teenage workers didn't have what most restaurants have: rythym. But with Billy on the team, things will go ok Fo' Sho'.  Later, Travis's dad picked Noah and me up and took us home. Travis and Kevin were also there, but Travis's dad was the one who was coming over to hang out. My dad brought home a new projector from work and we spent most of the evening in there watching Mystery Men (synonymous with "wicked old skool flick"...) and playing Halo. Halo only lasted 15 minutes because the parentals needed sleep. Pfft! Fuck sleep! Noah's usual character was called "Jammin'", but Will, my brother, snagged it. So Noah, his usual avatar snagged up, took one that I think Siping uses; Noodles. I quickly forgot that Will had this nick and thought Noah had it as usual. I got fragged by my pueri de frato but thought it was Noah! We shat on him time and time again, all the while HE thought he was Jammin'! Oh the humanity!  Satwodae, Mawch Twerteenth Noah came over, we watched Kiki's delivery service. Played games. Stop.   Toodee I was found dead at the scene. Speculations suggest SAT prep is the cause.  Less on this story, sooner.
