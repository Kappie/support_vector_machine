Like... huh?  To much over the top stuff is starting to happen and it's getting pretty ugly.  Oh, and Degrassi Crash Course, JT finally looks like a man, rather then a ten year old boy.  Sort of like what happened to Roger on Sister-Sister.    Work at Grandma's tommorow.  She's trying to claim I'm learning something from this, but in reality, despite the fact she has money, and lives in a house that could house a 10 person family, she still wants me to do the shit work outside the house.  She may not understand, but I have school, and at the same time due to stupid black family values, I'm completely unable to say "no" to half the outlandish and crazy request she makes.  It makes no sense! None.
