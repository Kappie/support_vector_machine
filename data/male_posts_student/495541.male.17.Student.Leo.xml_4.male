I say this because if you read the last entry, you would know my mom told me to stay off the computer on Sunday and today is Sunday.  So I tell you this because I think you should know.  I think I'm addicted to using the computer.  It's either that or I just find it to be much more entertaining than sitting in front of the television.  Whatever the case, it's caused me to go against my mother.  So there you have it, I'm a sinner and you know because I've admitted it.  Sometimes I just hate the things I do, but after, I have no idea why I did them.  I think, what could have possibly caused me to be so horrible at that point in time.  I can honestly tell you most of the time, I can never figure it out.  It would be as if I had lost my mind completely at the time.  I'm not sure what I'm saying is completely true or sane for that matter.  I can only assure you of one thing... the things that end up in this blog come only from one person and that person is me.  That's all for now, I suppose.  Good night.
