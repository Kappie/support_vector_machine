Now, watching this documentary inspired me to set some goals for my life.  I was inspired by Galileo's insatiable curiosity for the world, and there was a time when learning something new was all the world to me.  I want to revive that attitude, and learn something new everyday.  When I see things now, I think 'How does that work?'.  I sit in front of a monitor, wondering how it works, and what 'liquid crystal' is.  Whenever I'm at an electronics store now, I wonder 'How do you get plasma into a monitor?'.  Now, when I see the stars, I will think about how I'm really looking back in time, because the light created by those stars are millions of years old.  I will wonder 'How does a gas giant stay together?', or 'Did a comet's tail really spawn life on Earth?'.  I feel that there is so much to learn about the world, and so little time.  So, today, I resolve that I will learn something new everyday, whether large or small, significant or irrelevent, I will learn and understand it.
