This time, Robert Grossman, Dave Rogers, Ali Tramba, Erin Looshel, David Antone, and Jenny Evans came along. Sometimes all the lines were busy and we had to wait for one or the other to get off. Having more people exponentially increases your chance of hearing funny stories--Rob had over 4 people talk about their miscellaneous injuries and maladies with him, David called someone named Myrlin (who we wanted to ask to put a hex on GW), and I got ahold of someone who was "on the road." David and I noticed how anyone who supports Bush always says " BUSH ." so definitively and defensively. The ones who say "Kerry" pause a little and seem like they're really thinking. I called someone who didn't register because she believed that all the canditates were the same. Anyone who says that is terribly uninformed. Yeah, Dems and Republicans alike do cater to big business, and there are some irksome similiarities, but get your head out of your politically aloof ass. Kerry has the 11th most liberal rating in the senate. He's great at speaking, actually knows what he's talking about, and has a plan to get the country out of the gutter into which it's climbed and prepared to die.  Saying "they're all the same" is just an excuse for you to be apathetic.  I saw this in someones profile: "I hate it when all these people aren't voting because they say that it'd be just picking the lesser of the two evils. For god's sake, pick the lesser!" (don't remember who it was from though). I don't think Kerry is really an anti-Bush ticket. He's got a good plan for a) getting our troops home while simultaneously balancing Iraq's turbulent government b) dragging our sick, oil-sucking economy out of the depths of defecit c) getting our civil liberties back and "ending the age of Ashcroft" d) backing up our ailing schools. I think he's harping too much on his Vietnam service, but we're not getting on Bush's case enough.  There's a huge difference between dodging the service because you disagree with war and dodging the service because you're a coke-blowing pussy . Oh, and that shit about Swift Boat Veterans for Truth--all lies. Check out  urlLink www.spinsanity.org  where you'll see the downlow (the headline is Spinning Swiftly, date 8/9). David and I are going to volunteer at the Festival of the Assumption and pass out literature. I expect we'll have lots of supporters, but some who will go on about Kerry's Pro-Choiceness. Hello people: Bush.  IS.    NOT.      PRO-LIFE  .  Think of all the people that man has put  TO DEATH  as governer of Texas. Think of all of the innocent Afghanis, Iraqis ( who are now in the 10-13 thousand range   urlLink www.iraqbodycount.net ) and not to mention our own soldiers. How can you call him a Pro-Life president? It's a non-issue, throw it out, don't let it decide your vote. Besides, it's absolutely ridiculous to hinge your vote on something like that. If you want, you can be pro-life UNDER KERRY who has all the benefits of being A MUCH BETTER CANDITATE THAN BUSH. And must we go spiralling into this debate?  Pro-Choice does NOT mean pro-abortion . Kerry just doesn't want to force his religious beliefs on others. And you know what? Sagging economies means less money to raise children which means the numbers of people having sex goes down...PFFF--WRONG. The number of abortions should go up. (I'm hypothesizing here, don't take this for absolute fact.) Who do you want at the helm? Someone who's "Pro-Life" and is responsible for terrible economic plight, or someone who's Pro-Choice and pulls us up to a position where people won't want abortions. Huff. Well, to end on a good note, here's a clip of GW getting totally owned at the Unity Conference (collection of all minority journalists who asked the President and Kerry questions, each of whom had different days. George got 5 rounds of applause including the ones where he got on and off stage. Kerry had 20 some--am I right David?).  urlLink http://poststuff2.entensity.net/081204/media.php?media=bush.wmv   ____________________________________________________________________  From Davy:    Yeah calling is a sinch and all, but man....all I have to say  is that the majority of the elderly people in Bay Village are a  CRANKY  bunch to say the least. Just because you're old and senile doesn't mean you have to moan and fart at me for volunteering to help make the country a better place for me AND you (some of you just fail to realize that yet). Other than that, the calling went fine. Called 100 people and I had more Kerry supporters this time which is surprising for Bay Village. Thanks to Steve for that link to the Bush vid. I watched all that live on C-SPAN and I've been waiting ever since for a clip of that ramble. Mark, from what I remember, Kerry got about 40 rounds of applause. Bush got AT MOST 10. Don't forget that half-way through Bush's speech a man stood up and started yelling at Bush in protest(thanks to C-SPAN for showing the dude). After about....say 5 seconds, the man was swarmed by the secret service and escorted out of the building (hopefully not detained indefinitely as an ENEMY COMBATANT). Let's just say that the UNITY Conference was just a sweet sneak preview for the debates in October.     'Bring it on!', George. Give em' hell, John!  Myrlin casts Lvl. 5 Hex Spell on GW! ROLL D20!  2nd post by David Edward Antone
