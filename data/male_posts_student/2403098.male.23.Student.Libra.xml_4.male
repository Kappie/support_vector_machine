I need to portray that my abilities are a result of my diligent work and a process of maturing and growth though trials, tribulations, and circumstances overcome.   The personal statement is almost done, and as it comes to a close I realize that the world cares mostly how you portray yourself, and that no matter how much you accomplish at this point in your life (23), the most important part is what you are perceived to be capable of.  I am no more competent to be a law student than the next guy, but I must somehow hook an entire committee with the bait of my words in order to make them see that I'm worth the while of granting acceptance into their institution.  It is very scary for me, but it's ALMOST done!  Woo.  Even in the years of my Marketing major, I realize that getting by, getting in, getting through is half (or more) of the process of success.  Not simply turning out grades through memorization.  I'm not saying I am lying in my personal statement at all, because I feel it is all accurate truth.  I just sometimes am struck with the realization that being who you are is not enough.  Being who you NEED to be in the eyes of those whose opinions determine your fate is what matters most.  Highlighting that which needs to have light shown on it, and making sure that you sell yourself for all you are worth and driving home your talents and abilities.  I'm a WHORE I am WHORING MY ABILITIES OUT TO LAW SCHOOLS.  I don't think that's wrong, it's just a funny concept.  Because really when we apply for jobs, when we apply to schools, etc. We get all dressed up.  Be it figuratively or literally, we make ourselves look as attractive as possible: on paper, in person, in interviews, in transcripts and resumes.  They have what we want, and we want to make sure they know that we are what THEY want.  Whoring is probably a bad example, but it's fun to think about.  We're literally trying to get them to accept us so that we can get paid!  I can only hope that when those law schools drive their car past my corner, they will roll the window down and ask me to get in.  Ask me to join them on a 3 year journey and pay me well with their education.    Now all I have to do is find a pimp.  I think my pimp has been so many people who have helped me get to where I am.  I'm just so excited to be about to apply, but still scared at the same time because I don't want to let go of my documents, and then suddenly realize there was a typo, an error, a missed comma, a line about how I was on Apollo 13, when really it was Apollo 12 (a much less exciting mission).  Anyway, thanks to all my pimps.  Please wish me well, as I put on my whorin' clothes and send these applications out.
