The uptown track of the 2 and 5 train line was out of service for a lengthy strip of track--beginning at 149th St.  Amy and Emily continued to point and laugh loudly and extravagantly.  They had met at mandatory workplace sensitivity training and instantly hit it off.  Life growing up on the upper west side had not intersected their paths until two weeks ago.  Emily revealed a camera from within her handbag and poised it before her right eye.  She proclaimed, "I have got to take a picture of this," causing Amy to let out louder fits of laughter.  They had just left a Yankees game.  The stadium, which stood proudly on 161st St.  Grand Concourse was just about the only feature of the South Bronx capable of attracting white people.   	"Emily!  I just had a  classic  idea! I'm going to pay this bum to pose with you in front of all that shit," Amy shouted.   	Emily was up for it; she replied with an affirmed, "Let's do it!"

He smells," Emily sneered with a beaming grin on her face.  The homeless man did not smile, and neither did anyone else on the platform.
