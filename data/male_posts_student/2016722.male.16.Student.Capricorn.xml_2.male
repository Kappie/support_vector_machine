The piece isn't that hard, and I've only practiced it a total of 4 days or so, but I had a lesson on it a few weeks ago which was good. Its also short. You realise how short it is when you actually audition. I'm not getting as nervous as I used to, I'm getting out of the teenager anxiety stage.  Madama Butterfly is so beautiful. My view of music was so messed up when I was younger. I would have called something like Madama Butterfly or somehting from an even earlier period "modern". I thought the Mendelsohn String Octet was modern the first time I heard it. It was actually lots of Eastman professors, including Ilya Kaler as first violin. Eastman should get him back. Anyway, now I think Wagner's operas are modern. I think I'm correct in assuming that. Of course, I thought I was correct before too.  Oh, I think I'm one of the "winners" for the "competition", because the director asked if he could borrow my score I got from Sibley. I hope Maeve got picked, because she's awesome, and if not her.. who? Not Addison, I beg of you.  Uh, track 5 first act, Madama Butterfly, heart breaks open on floor...
