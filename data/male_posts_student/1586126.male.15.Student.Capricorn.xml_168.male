Like most of you may know the U.S. don't wantsto allowpeople to pass through the border between these to countries.I really comprehend this action made by de U.S. since, among the average foreign Mexican in the U.S., there aredrugdealers and people you wouldn't likein you country if you are a straight presidentwith a high and strong moral. The problem I have with them is that they generalize making everyone look like a drug dealer. They complain about us being the ones that sell the cocaine, marijuana, and so on, but I wander who are the stupid that buy it? Where ever you go in California or Texas or any of those states that are close to Mexico, they see you as just another Mexican that came here because, either we cross the border to seewhat the land of the free is all aboutor ether because they are so merciful that sawyou and saw the miseryyou were living inyour tree house with a roof made out of palm trees' leaves. Mexicanswentthere because the U.S. crashed Mexican economy with their NAFTAstarve-to-death-agreement in the early 90's. Whether you are Brazilian, Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, or Nicaraguan they see you just as another pathetic-ignorant-country-music-lover-Mexican with noright to look at their pair of omnipotent eyes. These discrimination and indifference to latinos irritates us creating a situation just like the one you have with the black people. I wander why is it. Your politicians, they are making a fascist country out of yours and that's becauseyou discriminate,you are afraid of everything that is different from you, black, Latino, Chinese, Indian, all those so called "minorities" are just what you are afraid of because they aren't minorities and you know that.
