I thought i am suppose to be determine and have strong will power??? Why am i stil thinking of that person??? Sigh... Why is God treating me like that??? I can one just know me down and let me lost my memories??? I want to start afresh... Definately some one would say i selfish... If really got all my memories got erased, i would forgot my friends as well... Sigh... Then??? Can some one tell me what can i do???   I think i would just keep myself busy and forget everything... Just keep myself occupied... Thank you you two... Really make me suffer so much... Thanks... I've learnt quite alot in this lesson... Whatever it is, i'm determinesd to get rid of you two out of my mind! Mark my words!!!  Hmm... today have to go to go for barbeque later in the evening... So writing it now incase i don't have the time to write later at night... Tomorrow is English mock examination??? Oh NO!!! Hope it will be cancelled...  What to write??? Now very vexed... Down with flu, dreamt of that person... Bad day Bad day... Thought its over... But its not... Sigh... Now i will have to practice to resist temptation already... Hope i can do it... *cross fingers*  Having sore throat too... How i wish that person was there to take care of me and shower me with whatever i need... But its over... One moment of irrational thinking leads to this, making me so regretted with what i've done... But whatever has done is done... No point turning back time... Even if some one told you the profecy of yours, you still won't be able to edit it... You will just merely delayed it... It will still happen to you.. Sigh... What a day!!!  Sorry if i have dampen you guy's mood... I don't meant to... But i felt worse than you all i think... I shall end here now... HOpe tomorrow will be a better day for everyone!
