    
       Right now it's like the worst of both worlds.  There are the bad parts of summer, heat, humidity, and insects; but still the work of school.  Namely this huge research paper on Liberia on which I've still only done seven substantive note cards.  On the plus side, I feel kind of like a history detective because I've been using so much microfilm.  But then I messed up one of the microfilms and it caused a big fiasco with the librarians; oh well.  I also saw Jeremy at CVS; he tried to talk to me but I was still out of it on account of the heat.  At least I'll only have one real assignment left come Monday.  And then there's been a little bit of a resurgence in The Issue, but it's too hoooooot to think about that right now.  Oh, and I missed such a good opportunity today when I was asking Melody how her weekend had been and she was like, "annoying" "it's hot," and I should have been like, "yeah, I have that problem all the time."
