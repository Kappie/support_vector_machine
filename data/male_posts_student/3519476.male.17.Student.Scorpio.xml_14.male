Solitude  needed somebody, yet i was all alone by myself in no man's land all that i felt, left unknown where was the comfort in my time of need i tried to reach out but yet i couldnt speak no one was there to listen wat my heart wanted to tell i was left mending my own thots crying as i fell... is it too much to ask that somebody be here to ease my troubled mind by just providing that listening ear my tears seemed to be my only companion i tried but i could not stop maybe they are my only true frens the only comfort that i've got as hard as i tried my smile just seem to fade away my heart as heavy as lead makes a sad end to my day i just wish that someone would tell me its alrite that in all taht happens, he/she will be by my side the world in all its splendour yet a place of little comfort my tears seemed to have dried up but i still feel that hurt...
