Mine was to study the coefficients of static friction of a variety of materials and some other factors. Have to put a mass on a plane then increase the "tita" to a point where the mass slides down and measure the "tita". Have to change material everytime and all those bull also. Man my results we're all over the place with hugh errors and inconsistency. And to top it all we didn't have time to finish our reports ! Arrghhh !!! And to think that its counted for our total marks in PH ! Omg...... And everyone else had problems too. Next time i'm sure everyone will come to lab prepared for everything......   *** It seems only jolene bothers to comment on my posts...for everyone's info u guys can talk cock by clicking  on the COMMENTS button below every post. And if karen u're seeing this we can go lepak anytime , but its hard to contact u when ur phone is broken =P ***
