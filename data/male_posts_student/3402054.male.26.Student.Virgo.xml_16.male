Only opened two weeks ago. I highly recommend it to those travelling the Northeast Corridor.  I mention this merely because my lunch consisted of a  one-pound  hamburger. With onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  Doesn't look so big side to side, but it certainly sinks well into the lower bun. (Oh dear--no pun intended.) This was followed, of course, by some warm, rich chocolate dessert that only a Jansenist or an Atkinite would term sinful.
