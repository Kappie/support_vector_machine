Its a good job I can improvise (part of being a teacher I guess) still, only one more to go and its pay day Friday so guess who's going out. I had to laugh at the weather reports this week. Every day they've said that it's going to rain and as soo as I look outside the sun is beating down and it;s absolutely baking. Today, they've said that the weather will pick up and what o I see as I look outside... it's  raining .   Talking of the weather I was watching the first test yesterday. Well there's a promising situation gone right up the spout. Looking good coming back fromt the winter tours and asked to bowl, England managed the most half- arsed, pathetic attempt at anyhting I've ever seen. Unbelievable. Still, we'ver got four more days to make it up and if that fails we can always rely on the weather.  On sports of a more positive note, a Calgary Flames shirt and Canadian flag has just gone up in the window opposite. Fair enough, if you're going to put in the best post- season's performance since 19-- then I suppose you'd want to make the most of it. The finals start on the 25th, and I don't see me getting any sleep  that  week.  I've gotta go noe to make the most of the sleep I've got.  Jack
