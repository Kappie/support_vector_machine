I'm kinda on sugar overload at the moment. I'm takin pictures for the band video...beware...    The Time flies nothing more than a shadow countless chances extiguished by anger  Love dies lies and accusations wounds from a stalemate burn deep within my soul  God help me appearances decieve the truth distant covered by what is fake  I can't see the world blinds me things have changed their marks are on my walls  I don't understand why black soothes my mind why i wear a target of misfortune in which people place upon me their insults and hate  I stand before all forsaken land I stand for Jesus Christ who leads me from my hell  You can't touch me You can't break me for God will give me obstacles but HE will help me through them.  God help me now.    -Ames
