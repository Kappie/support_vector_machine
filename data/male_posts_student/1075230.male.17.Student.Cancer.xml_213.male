The newspaper special on the flood was pretty cool... i forgot that our school basement flooded until the newspaper reminded me =P    Along the lines of extra-curricular, dragonboat is exhausting... 15 mins running, 5 min formation running, push-ups, crunches, leg lifts, squats, "mission impossible"/"superman" (don't ask... they give weird names to exercises =P ), and if i stay for the after practise, more training ^^ all-in-all, i don't mind ... since the entire point for me to join was to get back into shape   Sorry for the long post... last thing i will mention is the focus debate. it really brought me back to the good ole ignatius days... i swear, everyone who's been in that gifted program knows that that place is *paradise*. And fittingly, any team who had ignatius people won at that debate... we swept the focus debates, go us! ^^ ah... i went all-out on my "worthy opponents" on that day... so fun ^^ during these formalized arguments thingies, i'm able to become more aggressive knowing there'll be no hurt feelings afterwards =P um... reminds me of CSUNA... but eh, the debate was cool ^^ good times... top debater for the two debates i've attended would be phil and carson.    kk, sorry again for the long post (then again, it wouldn't be me, if it wasn't a long post, huh? =P )   ~Chronos
