That was awesome.    I do have a question for all of the 2nd period, or 6th period kids.  On the issue of abortion, what do you all think of the "Morning After" pill?  I was talking to Bethany about it today, and I was just wondering if any of you had any imput on the issue.  Oh, and here's a random piece of info, for those of you who said that no one would want to adopt African Americans, or that the majority of the poor women who get abortions are black:  The amount of black women who get abortions is half of that of white women.  Black women actually have hugely decreased the amounts of abortions, and the reason behind it is because the African American Baptist Church has gotten so involved in enforcing abstinence. So..there's something to chew on for any of you all who had expressed that black women were having the most abortions in America.  I hope that you all are having a wonderful and fun weekend, see you all in school on Monday!    Kimber
