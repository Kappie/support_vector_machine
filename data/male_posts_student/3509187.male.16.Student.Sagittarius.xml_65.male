It's about a detective that got shot in the head and when he recovered (if you can call what he is now recovered) he was hired by SCI: Serial Crime Investigations (I don't think thats the exact right name, but you get the idea).  He is reall funny but also a great agent.  He has this insight that is creepy and awesome... If I had to compare it to other shows I'd say is almost like CSI with the investigation of Crimes, but not exactly the same.  It's really hard to compare, and there isn't usually to much of the victums.  You have to watch it and tell me what you think.  -Dan V
