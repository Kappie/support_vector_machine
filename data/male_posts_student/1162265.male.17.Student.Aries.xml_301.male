Jimmy is finally going out with Hazel though, does that prove A. being politcally correct by having the two black people date or B. even when they are in a horrible minority people of the same race always seem to be attracted to each other.  Beyond the point, Teri got knocked into a coma.  How's that for a plot twist?  And I'm rambling to all you losers who don't watch Degrassi.  So we have the graduation thing at church.  This dude B. Smith graduated.  I always sat behind him in church and wondered how old he was.  He really looks different.  The the eccentric Kevin Grant, who already knows Chinese, Japanese, French and German.  He spent a year in Germany (sophmore year?).  Completely insane.  Then the lovely Farrah, Nefertiti, and LaDonna were graduating as well.  Sad to see them go.  Insha'llah.  We went to this ultra posh resturant for Father's day.  The bill was over 700 dollars for 12 people, but I suppose it was worth it for the rich people food at The Manor.  My dad over indulged in Oysters saying they are really expensive, I had one.  It tasted like I remembered, like seawater.  More rich people food, and 2 hours later everyone is full so we returned home.  Dad says "Oh no, I left my bag at the place, Marcus come on, I need you to run inside!"  I sighed, a trek back to west orange.  So we get off 280 and stop at a light. My dad jumps out of the car in the middle of the street and is like "you drive!" so I quickly try to change the seat into a more comfortable posistion and all that jazz.  Then we drive off.  We get to the place, and my dad tells me to stop in an awkward place in the parking lot, and then runs inside.  So one of the guys is like "move your car more over there." So, I'm thinking, I'm about to break the law by driving without my dad in the car, but hell this guy doesn't know that.  So I pull across the parking lot no prob.  Dad comes back we do the long drive home (he was convinced going down northfield with me would be easier then going down 280, and considering how absent minded I am I suppose he was right).  Now he says I'll be driving part way to MV this summer.... GAH!!! It'll be like 2AM and I'll be 'shit-ass-tired'.  Whatever, as long as he brings the wireless card, I can use the 'net when he's driving.
