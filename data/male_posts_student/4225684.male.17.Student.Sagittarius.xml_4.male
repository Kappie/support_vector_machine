Many times in life, we are all guilty of using these simple yet powerful words. Not my fault that happened. Not my fault this happened.    Well whose fault is it then? Before muttering those words without thinking, do we actually spare a thought to think about whether or not the situation might have been different if our actions had been different? So does it mean that it is not your fault and that the situation will still be the same if you had done pursued a different set of actions totally?      Like it or not, whatever actions we choose to do, it will in the end, affect those around us. Suicide will only result in loved ones breaking down and mourning over the loss. Betrayal will only cause those betrayed to be bitter and teach them to be more negative about life which is totally unnecessary. And love, well it can be both good and bad.. Ultimately, our actions, WILL affect those who are in immediate proximity to us.      Think for your actions are consequential. A simple lie can lead to great disaster and misunderstandings. A frown can sow discord and break relationships. And on the other hand, a simple smile can grow to a beautiful friendship which can be kept till the end of your life. Will you choose to act selfishly? or selflessly.. Make the choice, take the plunge but whatever it is, dont regret your choice for things in life can come and go, but choices we make will stick and be with us till we lie in our graves.      "Saw your smile, felt your grace,   Entered a place called heaven,    wished it wouldnt displace.   Dreamt of kisses, Sensations of love,   Woke up alone, lying in that bed so cold.   The grip of that hand, the firm affirmation,   guides me closer, to what you call salvation.   My actions all lead me, all let me confirm,   that what i do is not entirely of me,   but totally for you....."
