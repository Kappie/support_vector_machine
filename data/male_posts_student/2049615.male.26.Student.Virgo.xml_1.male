Several years ago, probably about seven, I was walking around the Library Mall on the UW-Madison campus late one Friday night with a few friends when we were approached by a group of three people looking for the  urlLink La Bamba's .  When we explained to them (two guys and a girl, all dressed in a fairly collegiate manner) where it was, they explained, without being prompted, that they were students at Purdue, and that one of "the things to do" there was to take roadtrips out to eat at all of the various far-flung La Bamba's locations.  I've repeated this story to many people over the years, and their responses have ranged from bemusement to dismissal.  Since coming to Indiana, I have realized that for the most part, someone living in West Lafayette would not have too much trouble getting to at least five other La Bamba's locations in road trips of less than two and a half hours:  Muncie, Indianapolis (they have three), and Bloomington.  There are in fact seven La Bamba's in Indiana, compared with nine in Illinois, many of which are within striking distance of Purdue;  four in Wisconsin, and one each in Ohio and Kentucky.   At any rate, the idea that a group of bored Purdue students would take a drive of such a manageable length in order to gain the dual benefits of the camaraderie of the road and greazy-ass Mexican food becomes more plausible.  From there it is simple to suppose that occasionally, a few of them would get it into their heads to go on a  really fuckin' heavy-duty  La Bamba's pilgrimage every once in a while.  Like Khotanese Hajjis, the sheer length of their trip demonstrates a truly awe-inspiring devotion.  Considering this, it should come as no surprise that at approximately 3 AM this morning, I would run across two men, wearing Purdue sweatshirts and walking rather briskly up Indiana Avenue, turning on to Kirkwood, and having the following exchange:  "They're gonna be open, right?"  "Yeah man, I just made sure.  I called ahead."  "And they said they'd be open?"  "Yeah."  When they finally reached the steps up to La Bamba's they started whooping and ran inside.  I would call this sad, but about five years ago or so, I drove to Centerville, Iowa, near the Missouri border.  What motivated my trip?  It was far less than an indigestion-inducing burrito, friends.  I went there solely because it is the city nearest to the physical location referenced by the title of the  urlLink Wire  song, " urlLink map ref. 41ºN 93ºW ".  Not that the song has anything to do with Centerville, Iowa, mind you.  The song is essentially about geography in the most abstract possible sense.  The title was probably chosen as a random set of coordinates.  Therefore it is probably fortunate for me that the coordinates did not refer to, for example, the center of the Great Salt Lake or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.  There was certainly nothing in Centerville itself that pointed to the involvement of any late-70s UK art punks.  Centerville is clearly a Randy Travis kind of town, and far from an unrulable expanse of geography.
