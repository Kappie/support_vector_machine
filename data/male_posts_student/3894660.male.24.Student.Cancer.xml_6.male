She lied!!! @#$*!!@# Not to mention I found out that the theme park was closed!!! What the.....I was so angry n pissed off.....sorry dear, I was angry at them not u...  Yesterday I was so tired when i get back that i forgot to update the blog. We celebrated our 4 months together and we had a fantastic dinner thou as usual we couldnt finish the food. My darling had a very happy day shopping away, got herself a pair of pink pants and a tee. Yup Pink pants! Who would have imagine shan shan wearing pink? I also got moiself a pair of slippers! Almost didnt get it, lost my temper again at shan shan taking so long changing.... Guess what? My darlyng and me got same sized feet!!! Wah.......   Well once again i lost my temper tis morning. I realise its not her fault n now i regret flaring up, nvm later i make up to her by being super patient, luving, luvy dovy and attentative....wonder if I would succeed? Today i shall promise myself to be more patient and not lose my temper. Hope I have a wonderful day at the chalet??? Update when i get back!     Quote for the day: Do not take your partner's patience for granted, appreciated the effort they take in luving you.
