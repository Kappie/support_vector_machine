Oh well.  no one reads this anyways - cuz its not a live journal.  For me to archive anyways.  I have a hard time remebering things some time.  Maybe this will help.  I am a married man - happily married to mimi! So now married life starts.  Weird, but it doesn't feel that different.   Honey moon was eventful - most memorable recap would be snorkaling, Mayan Ruins, going to the grocery store, and getting robbed.  Some one broke into our rental car on the last day of our trip and stoke my watch and sony handycam.  FUCK! I am still a little bitter about the whole mess.  The wedding was awesome.  I should have some pictures any day.  I had a good time there.  I feel like an old man now.  At least I have the best body ever for a married man.  I love fucking pushing weights around, working out in the gym.  I think that is a good reason I was glad to be back in DFW.
