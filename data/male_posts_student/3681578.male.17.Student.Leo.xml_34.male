Still, the burden of service hours are futher lessened as I just did 6 hours kanina...so technically I have only an hour more to go but I decided to spend the bulk of my free time with COMELEC na rin so I have extra service hours...  It was kinda easy...you just sit there and assist...  Anyway, I am gonna flunk another math quiz...mainly because I was too tired to do homework yesterday...now, Doc Mara gave us a written homework so I have to do that...  There...I watched Bombita kanina and it was a smart and nice play...really...  I have two papers to draft over the weekend and I am gonna ask Sir Mark stuff about my paper for Lit tomorrow...  There...    --Logged Out--
