(needs to make sure my teenage legs fit in the back) Cars here are awesome they look small but they have a large amount of room inside actually. Its an optical illusion  This girl I met on Teesnspot.com is gonna meet /w me in dublin city centre on Sat. maybe something will happen. But at least I will have 1 friend in ireland.  Found out im not going to that school I posted about earlier. Now i gotta go to some other one. I think the site it www.oatlands.net .  Whatever as long as it's co ed.  Still waiting for my graphics card to show I wanna play d3 BADLY! I played it at the LAN on saturday and it was hella fun!!!!!!!!  Didnt get lunch until 4 pm and didnt eat much bfast. Meh...tomorrow will be better I hope.
