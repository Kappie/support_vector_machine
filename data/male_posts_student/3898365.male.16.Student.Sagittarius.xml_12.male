I saw a poster for it when we went to see  Eternal Sunshine  at Cinemagic, and Robin and I laughed at it over, and over, and over.   I went outside! Huzzah! Robin's daddy took Robin, Elise, Devin and I to.. Feyrer Park?Feryer Park? Something like that. It was the place that Gilford took us for the Ecology final. The place where that kid fell down the tree, only to be saved by Super Jenny. Yeah, that place. We swam in the river and drank Coke and played on the playset and had a jolly good tyme. We had sunscreen that smelled like bubble gum. It took all my willpowernot to try to taste the stuff, or to rip a chunk out of my sunscreened body with my teeth.   The presence of large Mehican (I spelled it like that purposefully. If they're going to pronounce it like that, then I'm going to spell it like that.) families was astounding. Each picnic table along the river had about ten people of hispanic origin occupying the seats.   Dude, okay, am I the only one that thinks changing a baby's diaper in public, unsheilded from all the people around is completely disgusting? Seriously, dude. There was a bathroom not ten feet away, yet there was some lady changing her baby right on the fucking top of one of the picinic tabes. Besides the fact that there were about fifty people in the area, and all were exposed to a smelly nude baby, people eat off of those tables. That's just fucking gross. Somebody needs to invent alittle fold out personal tent to hide things like that.   Haha, you know those boxes with the built in gloves that scientists use to handle nuclear or poisonous materials? It should be like that.   Whatever.   I've seen two displays of horrible, horrible parenting over the last week. The first one was at Blockbuster on Monday. While my father and I were waiting in line to check out our items, and there was a mother with her two kids in front of us. This little boy, probably 8 or 9 years old, had a rattail growing down to the bottom of his shoulder blades. Today at the park, I was done swimming so I grabbed Mr. E's  Beautiful Freak  and sat down at our table for a while. And there was this kid, couldn't have been more than two years old. He was wearing nothing but a diaper and sucking on a bottle. When I saw the back of his head, he had the beginnings of a rattail, only about one inch long, while the rest of his head was shaved down to stubble.   God, that just makes me sick. Who the hell thinks that is a stylish and cool looking haircut? Who?!? It's gross. Why would you want to punish your kids like that? Everybody already hates little kids that don't belong to them, so why give them another reason to be hated? Ugh. I swear to God, someday,  someday , I'm going to drive around the country with a pair of scissors in each hand, and lop off every rattail in sight. I will. I will. I fucking will.   eMule is my savior. It's a p2p file sharing program that just kicks so much ass so far. I leave for weeklong family reunion camping trip on Sunday, and I've been downloading all the cds I possibly can so I'll have a bunch of new stuff to listen to on the drive and while I'm there. That's where eMule comes into my life. On Kazaa, whenever I'm trying to get all the mp3s from a certain Cd, there is always one or two songs that nobody has or that take months to download. But with eMule I've been downloading zip files of whole cd's. After two days I've managed to gain  Beautiful Freak  by Eels,  On Avery Island  by Neutral Milk Hotel,  Tyrannosaurus Hives  by The Hives,  Yours, Mine  Ours  by The Pernice Brothers,  Franz Ferdinand  by Franz Ferdinand,  Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid by Elefant, and all three volumes of  69 Love Songs  by The Magnetic Fields. Dude, it's not like that. It's called  69 Love Songs  because it's three Cds, each with 23 songs. 23 x 3 = 69. Most of it is serious and pretty music, but some of them are just weird.   Dammit. July 28th only marks the opening of  Garden State  in New York and L.A. We have to wait until August 6th for it to open in other states. Bastages.   I want to get everyone together and go see  The Village  when I get back from camping. I want, want, want that movie so badly. I want to jump and scream and sweat and be amazed like I have at all M. Night's past movies. I love it.   Guys, I'm sorry, I like using Blogger more than Xanga. Things change. I love Xanga, and we got along fine, but I just need to move on. I'll leave my entries up forever, but this is where I'll be from now on, and this is where I'm staying.   Done, and, done.
