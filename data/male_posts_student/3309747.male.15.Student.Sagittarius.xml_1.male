Anyways, I've got some interesting things in my mind, that I'll pour out into this site. First off, if anyone knows how to play the card game Asshole (aka Janitor) then they should check out an article I'm putting up soon. I hope whoever reads this will appreciate my work and not critise it. This blog will also have stuff on books, philosophy, psycology, and just stuff that the average person doesn't do. New ideas, stories on our future, and my opinions on stuff.    BTW, I'm only 15.
