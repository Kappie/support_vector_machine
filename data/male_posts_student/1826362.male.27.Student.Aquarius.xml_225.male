It's battery seems to last around 4 hours or so, even with the wireless card running.   Once I re-learn all the keyboard shortcuts, I am sure I will never even think about windows again.   although a small part of me wonders if I like the mac so much because my previous os was windows 98, so maybe xp is as big of an improvement over win98 as osX is?
