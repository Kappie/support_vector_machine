Yesterday was interesting, went to Keane's house to practise some kendo.. it was a cheap imitation of the actual bamboo sword they use, plus we were just practising... but somehow I got slightly hurt ...*glares at von* ah well... pretty fun, even though we didn't get that much done.   Finish The Song of the Lionness quartet... I think I fell asleep while reading till very late... parents must've been wondering why the lights was still on in the morning... and why I was wearing my glasses... ^^;;    Course selection soon... I can't escape it, my dad is forcing me to take all 3 sciences even though the smart people at my school advise against it... --;; watch me fail and my parents blame it on my slackness.    Eheh, church was so empty today... must've been the snowstorm...   That's about all.. seems like I'm forgetting something.. ah, homework! Haven't done that in awhile.. must start soon... ja!   ~Chronos
