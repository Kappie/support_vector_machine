He was gonna see a movie also, but he got there late and it was packed so he didn't go. So I was waiting out there for maybe 20 minutes, the movie we were going to see had started, so I thought she was running a little late. So, about 5 minutes later, I call her and she says that she can't come. I'm thinking, Oh great, I'm stuck at the movies alone. So, I kept calling my house and after a while when there wasn't an answer, I decided to walk home. So, I'm leaving the parking lot and theres this car following me, then when I'm almost at the exit, the guy in it goes "Are you parked anywhere near here?" So I go "I don't drive" and he goes "Oh, well I wish you did" and then drives away lookng for a spot. I was like, ok. So, I'm walking and walking and walking, and when I was about at Target, I finally got ahold of my dad, so I tell him about what happened and said hurry home so we can get some supper. So I made it home a little while later. So, then we went to Kellys Roast Beef (not Rileys) and I had  supper. Then I had this soccer kick around with my team and another team. Then I came home and here I am!
