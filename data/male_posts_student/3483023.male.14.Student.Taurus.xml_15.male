We Eventually Got So Bored We Decided We Needed To Thank Of Something To Do. We Decided To Head Over To 'Frontier City' (Amusment Park)... That Was Fun. We Rode About Every Ride There, But There Was Like 5 Rides That Where Closed, That Kinda Pissed Us All Off. After Frontier City We All Just Headed Home, Watched TV, And Then Eventually Went To Sleep, Fun!
