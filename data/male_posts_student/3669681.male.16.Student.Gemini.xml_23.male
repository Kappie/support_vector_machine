It is text-based with a graphical interface. To play the game you use commands such as get, ask, talk, use, and give. The object of the game is to kill Trogdor the dragon because he has burninated your cottage.  The game was made by Videletrix for  urlLink HomeStarRunner .  Homestar is a flash animation  site.  It is my favorite!  The best part of the site are the  urlLink Strong Bad Emails .(Strong Bad is a character on the site). Be sure to watch some emails before you play the game. This will give you a taste of what the site is like so you will enjoy the game that much more.   BE SURE TO WATCH THE EMAIL CALLED  urlLink DRAGON !  IT WILL MAKE THE GAME MAKE MORE SENSE!   Have fun playing this throw back game. Remember things aren't always as they appear. If you need help with the game or just have a general question leave a comment and I'll help you.  HINT:  Try typing the word die in a non-critical part of the game.  HINT2: If you REALLY need help check out this   walkthrough  .   Happy Dragon Slaying +Matt
