Take me for example, I was once told by someone on the scene that I had great potential in mountain biking. And now here I am, 3 years later, with nothing more than a hundred dollar jacket and a bike that I don't ride.   I went to see the movie "Sweet Home Alabama" tonight. The character played by Reese Witherspoon reminded me so much of Amanda. Great fashion sense in a town full of rednecks. All her childhood she longed to get away from the small town, move to the city and find her calling. Once in the city, however, she realizes that nothing can compare to home, and that nothing can replace what was once took for granted.  My mother. She wished my brother and I were still 3 or four, still dependant on her. She tries frantically to get us back there, but she cannot do the impossible. She cannot find her way back there, no matter how hard she tries. This could be the starting point, the crack that makes her what she is today, and could lead one day to her possible insanity.  Yes, we wall have something left in the past, something lying there, waiting to be re-discovered. And just like the movie poster says, "Sometimes what you're searching for is right where you left it". But then again, maybe the today you want to escape will one day be the yesterday you long to have back....   urlLink  postCount('sweethome');
