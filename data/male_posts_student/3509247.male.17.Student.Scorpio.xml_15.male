I finally got things straigtened out with Steph for good (hopefully).  We now have it arranged where we're nothing more than good friends so there shouldn't be any more arguments.  How bout I tell you guys a little about camp.  I had a great time.  I met quite a few new people (many were girls).  I had a great time getting to know this one girl imparticular.  Her name is Thanh (pronounced ton with the 'O' as in song).  She's a friend of my sister's best friend, if that makes any sense.  Her family comes from Vietnam.  She is very pretty and very nice.  I don't mean to sound like I'm one of those people who likes someone new each week, but I do really like her and I think it will work out.  On top of that, she speaks perfect English, I have a good potential to see her quite a bit, and she kinda likes me too.  God really spoke to me in the messages preached at the camp.  Mainly in my closeness to him.  I don't think any of you knew this, but I hadn't been doing my devotions for quite a while.  Needless to say I wasn't close to God at all.  To use a meaphor, I was almost like a hired hand; someone used to do God's work at the price of an eternity in heaven.  What's the point in that?  God saved our lives from hell and all he wants is fellowship.  The part that I got wrong is that God would prefer fellowship over service.  For the first time I feel like I'm really a close friend of God's.  I cheered a lot while I was up there because I was on the red team.  We have to cheer frantically for our teams because we're on them and we want them to win (really confusing I know).  Because of that I lost my voice.  Unfortunately the weather was kinda cold about the time I lost my voice so I think I cought some kinda croopy cough thing.  Yuck-o.  In my cabin was some kid who only took one shower the entire week because some other kid made him take one.  He threatened that if the guy didn't take a shower he would physically force him (that's grosser than my croopy cough!).  Before I knew he didn't shower, he asked if he could borrow a long sleeved shirt because it was cold and he didn't have a longsleved shirt.  Well, after he wore it the whole day, the whole night, the whole next day and after he took a shower the whole next night, I let him keep it.  On the bus ride home I started talking with this girl I'd seen before, but always thought she was mean because she was never really nice to me.  So, we're pretty good friends, I just haven't talked to her since the bus ride.  I'm hoping I got her e-mail adress correct.  Her name is Phylicia.  Well, that's about all I can remember for right now, but I'm sure I'll remember some stuff later.  But as for now, this is Joshua Guynn signing off.  The dude returning from camp, JG gear
