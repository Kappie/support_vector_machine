Test and summer should never be in the same sentence together except maybe to say, "I better test this drink to make sure I put enough booze in it."  BUt i survived and I think I did quite well.  Then I went off to work and then home to hang out some and read some Langston Hughes which is actually pretty good.  I then decided to throw in Easy Rider a movie i have wanted to see for a long time but never got the oppertunity.  It was a pretty good flick.  Kinda odd but good.  I did get the feeling throughout the whole thing that I should be smoking a joint though.  Lots of drug use in this movie but it was cool.  Makes me want to get a motorcycle and ride it across America (my Mom would kill me if I ever got on a motorcycle).  Then I sat down to read a little and drift off to sleep which I couldn't do totally so i decided to update this little journal of mine.  Myabe entertain the millions of my adoring fans with some boring tidbits of my life.  But for now I'm off to try to crash again.  Got a busy day ahead of me and hopefully I will be able to grab a drink tommorrow.  Your Biker in Spirit and 21st century cowboy, Zeke.  I'll leave ya with a quote from Easy Rider since I'm in the mood...   Wyatt : You ever want to be somebody else?  Stranger : I'd like to try Porky Pig.
