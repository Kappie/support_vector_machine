Considering that I'm in Set 1 of 8 for maths, and I recently sat the bloody Additional Maths Paper (Question one: 'Prove by any means that the sides of a triangle that can be written as x^2, (2x)+2 (2x)-2 is right angled.'), it brings a warm glow to my heart when I see a question such as '48% of tourists holiday in England. What percentage do not?'. And I did the Chemistry Triple this morning. I didn't get onlt one question: 'How is ethene turned to ethanol for industry.' I didn't know. I still don't. I don't care. I never have to know or care again. Ahh... Gosh. What a dull post. Anyway, the ones in the holidays, when I have loads of spare time should fairly glow with wit and suprise. Goodbye readers!! (I know I have 7 returning visitors. And only 6 of those could be friends. So I have at least one fan. Go me!!)
