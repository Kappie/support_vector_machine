BeerBottle decided to have a talk with Spitshine there today. BeerBottle quit back in March and apparently he might be coming back. that's good cuz then he could take some of the stress away from the place. but TYRONE and Glick have yet to talk to Spitshine. they need to come back to the place.   ...  i meant to be at Adriana's graduation reception right now instead of here, blogging. but i tried to get a ride from TYRONE but he had already left by the time i called him. i didnt know of anybody else to call so, no going for me. i want my license. oh well, by getting it when i turn 18 i wont have to pay 400 bucks. yay. and 18 is only half a year away... the possibilities.    this summer is most likely going to turn out to be worse than i thought. i just got flipped on last night for my fourth quarter grade in Chem. dammit dont they understand that there is more to me than my f*cking GPA!!!!!!!!!!!!! arrr... (venting blog remember)  but anyways. i want to go skate again. that was so much fun, even by myself. it was great. i must admit i am a loner skater. but that's fine cuz it lets me skate without the psychological pressure of trying to impress your friends. well anywho, enjoy my posts thus far, leave a comment or two, then get the hell off of my site!! jk. mr. roboto... haha
