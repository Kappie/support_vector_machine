Anyway, it just means a long long time.  Hexic  is the name of the game, and I've top it (at least on my chart) Tara says she missed it, my guess is she have not given up beating my score my guess. Well, she's pretty close behind I guess. Next on the chart after me, she really can play hard man.   Then there was this other game we played,  Bejewel , a game I was totally not in luck with. I wonder if there was a trick to this game, she made it all the way to the top with out barking a sweat in one go. As for me, eight games and I didn't budge an inch on the chart. Did I mention that out of the eight games, five of them I was cussed with no more moves after jus seven to ten moves. So when I say she plays hard, I mean it.
