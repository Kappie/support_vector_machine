Having been recently elected to the Social Services Committee in my office, I had the pleasure of visiting a village 50kms to the south of NOIDA. It was wonderful to interact with the under-privileged children , some of whom had abundant talent unfortunately hidden inside the depths of Rural India . It was nice to see that there is a slow awareness on the need for Literacy  Dreams of making it big in hundreds of innocent eyes.                                                                It rained heavily on sunday in Delhi. But a few of us got together and played Cricket for 4-5 hours which was very refreshing  invigorating .
