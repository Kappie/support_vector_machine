It's the end of the school year, none of us care about school anymore (okay, I know I'm generalizing, but give me some poetic license here, people), and we're all ready to have fun.  Today was the day newspaper class (yes, all six of us plus Tony the Phantom Writer) threw our teacher Mrs. B a baby shower.  There are several reasons why this was oh-so-cool.  1.  Mrs. B is my favorite teacher.  She's also pregnant, which means I get to say "Aww, she's so pregnant!" 2.  Newspaper is my favorite class. 3.  Food is good.  Food is  very  good.  Food is good√≠simo. 4.  It's fun watching  urlLink Taylor  try (mind you,  try ) to lie.  He's getting better, but he's got a ways to go.  But when your subject is Queen Mal, you go from AP to Regular Lying.  Hehe, just joshin', man...and woman.  It's all in staff love. 5.  We saw Tony the Phantom Writer after a prolonged absence.  That's right, Tony.  Show up for the good times, man, and leave us high and dry when the goin' gets tough.  But hey, isn't that just the way life works? ETA: 6.  There's nothing like taking a you-think-it's-timed-but-it-turns-out-someone-didn't-press-the-timer-button-on-the-camera kind of picture.  Good times, my friends.  Good times.  The rest of the day was seriously nothing.  Of course, there was my Spanish teacher informing me that I had loads of make-up work to do (thanks, Sra. C).  Yes, I'm glad I'm not taking the class next year.  How sweet it will be!  Let me back track: I didn't do absolutely nothing (yes, a permissible double negative) today.  There was of course AP English in which Mrs. A and the senior AP teacher Mrs. M are still trying valiantly to work us into poetic analyses and vocab tests.  Come on, ladies; give us a break.  Everyone else realizes that school is practically over, so for all of your infinite wisdom, it's makin' you look kinda shady.  We're now showing our PowerPoint presentations in BCIS, and...um...hehe, this should be interesting.  My music's screwed up, and my slide show may not be long enough.  But am I complaining?  No, ma'am, because to complain would imply that I care, and quite frankly, my dear, I do not.  Poor Jenny, though; her whole presentation got screwed over.  All the changes she's made in the past week have been wiped out, so her presentation is down to a messy collection of cluttered pictures.  It's okay, Rho; the Super Friends will bail you out of this one.  Okay, enough with that.  Tomorrow is the AP US History field trip.  No, we're not going to the Empire State Building.  No, we're not going to Gettysburg.  No, we're not even going to the Texas Rangers Museum.  We're going to an old cemetery plot and a one-room schoolhouse!  Who needs US history when you can get good ol' Coryell County (which we don't even live in) history?  Hey, it's a day off from school (a Friday no less) and free food.  I simply cannot turn those two things down.  Well, I'm off to do homework.  Oh, wait, no I'm not.  Because I have none!  MWAHAHAHA!  Side note: No, I'm not high.  Just really excited that this crazy school year is almost over.  Intensely, magnificently excited.
