Just a normal day, still couldnt pick up my mood to do some stuff, i guess its really time i stood up myself and really head on to a fresh start.. things cant go on like this forever... i've still got my life to live, and my commitments. i cant let this mood of mine dominate me on and on... its just not right..  Messaged Aaron today. Was supposed to meet him up today at wadever time hes free, and was looking forward to a soulful chat with him. at least to let out my cooped up emotions, that i had in me coming to 3 weeks now.. Alas, this was not to be, when he didnt reply any of my sms-es, man, its like... if he couldnt, then just tell me la... not as if i was gonna flame him off for not able to.. just let me know... jeez. with that i stayed home the whole time, listless and disappointed. Hope i could get him out sometime nextweek,the bottling up felt kinda stuffy. At least in my head.  Gonna do some homework for now, and well, maybe head off to CS to buy another EA Classic, Renegade. I dont even speculate i might play at the arcade, i somehow spent too much on the outing yesterday. So, yeah, i guess thats it, dont know what to say too. Lost for words.  And so i keep on waiting.. for my loved one to come to me...
