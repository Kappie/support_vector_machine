Guns, Germs and steel is officialy the MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I read like 50 pages today, and so far of hte 135 pages i have read, i have somewhat enjoyed 1 CHAPTER. And the idiot author writes 20 pages on a subject, then procceeds to say at the end of each chapter "Each chapter can be summorized in one paragraph." So, im not going to put full effort into this, but im going to get through it.   Wow, what a boring day. I didnt go driving, i ate a lot. I read, I watched tv. um... i went on the computer. I played badmitten, and i went into the jacuzzi. Wasnt the most thrilling day, but yeah... The marlins won. Im on the phone with Brittney and Daniel. Yeah.  Well, i dont have anything to say, but it doesnt matter cuz only 2 people read my posts... yeah.  Bye.  CHARACTERS Daniel - Best friend ever Brittney - Best friend at Dreyfoos.
