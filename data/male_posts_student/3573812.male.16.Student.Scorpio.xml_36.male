Wednesday  I can't actually remember. Probably pissed around on the net like usual. Actually, that's exactly what I did, wasted the whole day on the net. Oooh, I started reading a new web comic,  urlLink Questionable Content . I'll credit that discovery to Campbellbecause I found the link on his blog. And I went to work too.    Thursday  Oooh, I actually did stuff that day. Went to town with Daniel. Returned the Nine Inch Nails CD that I got out from the library. Got a caramel frap from Starbucks. Bought a black jacket from Jay Jays. Put two shirts on lay by at Hallenstiens. God I'm a consumer whore. Then Daniel stayed the night. We had sushi for dinner at Chartwell. Then I ordered some Hi Top Red Chuck Taylors from Sterling Sports. I'm up to my face in debt right now. We watched  urlLink Cabin Fever  and  urlLink The Blair Witch Project . Cabin Fever was weird. Oh yeah, we watched the latest episode of  urlLink Mad TV  about five times. It's hilarious.    Friday  I woke up at about 11:20. Went on the internet like usual and pissed around a bit. Daniel finally woke up at 1:25. Didn't do much really. Went to work. It was actually quite fun tonight. We had some laughs. When I got home I rang up Jonathan because he was back from Whangamata. He's in Raglan at the moment. He was going to come in tonight so I could stay over but he's working tomorrow. He'll come in during the day though so we can catch up.    So that was my week. Not alot really. School starts again on Monday. Somebody just kill me now.
