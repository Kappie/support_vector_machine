Alright what's the longest you've ever waited before you did the nasty with someone after you met them?? What's the shortest time?? How long did you wait before you just gave up tryin to get a little. Okay personaly the longest I've waited with out getting further than a little touch and feel is over three years. Alright now we were on and off all that time, but come on I'm a man I need a little lovin. Why wit when I know I can go else where and meet a girl one night and be gettin it on later the same night. What's the longest you've known a member of the opposite sex and neither of you have made a move on the other. I'm talkin close friends here someone you hangout with frequently. Alright how soon is to soon though? I don't think there is a too soon if two people are diggin each other. Some people think that may be slutty, but I don't. I think waitin too long though is just fucked up though. Well that's what I think.   Remember: No glove no love.
