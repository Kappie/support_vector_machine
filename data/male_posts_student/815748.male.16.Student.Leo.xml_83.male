Tuesday I was PRETTY DARN HORRIBLE but the other team sucked so badly so I didn't look as bad.  Today I was decent, I was fairly good at articulation and whatnot on direct, and I only lost one one minor objection during direct.  During cross, I objected several times and a few were sustained; then I was not that excellent because I was flustered because I had no time to prepare, as there is a very short window for objections.  Plus, I missed a few opportunities.  But overall, I was much improved from Tuesday (when I was inaudible, missed an important piece of testimony, and didn't object at all), and fairly decent.  I certainly will not get a score perfectly comparable to Martin or Graham, but it was very good for me.  On Wednesday, I was sick, I had two tests which I hadn't studied for because I got home from Mock Trials (in Walpole) at 8:30.  Speaking of which, here's a little story about what happened after Walpole:  I needed a ride home from Walpole, but there was also a plan to go out to dinner, and I wanted to do that.  So I went over to the car I came in to get my bag with Matt Zimmer, but then I learned that that car wasn't going to dinner.  I looked around for Matt, but he had already gone to another car and I didn't see where he had gone.  So I walked around the parking lot alone, and saw that another car was on; it was Elliott's (the lawyer-coach's).  Matt Zimmer was in it; Elliott said that he was going to the restaurant but that he didn't have enough room, and to go check the third car.  They also didn't have enough room, so Elliott said to go to the car I came in again... they had left without me.  Finally, I went back to Elliott's car, and he put Matt in the front on the center console.  Later in the car I said, "Matt, sorry in advance if you die."  Someone asked Elliott what legal ploy he would use if he got pulled over; he said "The Doctrine of Necessity."  I don't know if that's real or not.  So we drove around, (during our driving we learned that the dinner plan was canceled) and Elliott took us to see the brand-new South.  It was stupefying.  There were such huge buildings everywhere.  Their gymnasium building was much bigger than ours.  Their science wing was bigger than our entire school.  And we could see that it was all modern and state-of-the-art, with internet in every classroom, offices for every teacher, and a student lounge on every floor.  Do we even have a student lounge, or any breathable offices?  I still argued that North was better, since it isn't the building that makes the school.  But DAMN.  Anyway, back to my missing school on Wednesday, I missed two tests that I am now going to take on Monday.  Four more days to study, that's pretty good.  Also, because I'm missing a couple of hours of school tomorrow, along with my "sickness" (though I plead the fifth), the Cold Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, two weekends, a trial, and the lack of E-block on Tuesdays, come Monday I will have had half of one history class in ten days.  Whoa.  The only other thing that's happening is that right after next weekend, I'm going to France.  I still haven't been able to contact my host family for over a month.  As the French would say, c'est mauvais.  Well, I'll see them when I get there.  To finish up, here are a few quotes from various places:  "I'm sorry I'm not a man." --- Melody Lun  "What was this for?  What was the big message that I was supposed to walk away from?" --- Ms. Heidlage  "I mean, he gets into the Jeep and he tries to drive it.  It's very hilarious." --- Ms. Heidlage  Oh, and here are a few things I wrote down when Ms. Heidlage was explaining Chinese dialects, which are orally unintelligible, and the differences between the Wade-Giles and the Pinyin transliterations, in which "Ch'" becomes "Q," "Ts" becomes "X," and "Zh" is pronounced like the first consonant in "Jacques."  By the way, Loren claims to speak Mandarin (that'll be useful information for the third thing).  -"X-mas" in Pinyin would be changed to Wade-Giles's "Ts-mas."  -Users of the Pinyin system, while in France, would say "Zhe m'appelle Alex."  -In response to "They [Mandarin-speakers] would not understand the words 'thank you' [in Cantonese.]":  Loren: Here's some bread.  Cantoner: Thank you.  Loren: HOW DARE YOU???!!!
