The new director is really cool...and I think he's going to lead us to great things. :-D  Me and Micah started our program today...I say our program because we did it last year. We want to mix fun with learning without yelling ;-D  I think we are going to do it quite well.   I hope Micah went home and wrote some warmups last night...cuz...well...haha Mine kinda sucks. I wrote one though.   Also...Last year we did alot of stuff with playing songs for the crowd for warmups....This year will hopefully be the same.   We already are working on "Yeah" from Usher...and some old favorites will return as well.   Its gonna be cool :-)  Only problem is... :-/ The rest of the band won't ever get to see them.
