I was going to update at 3:30, but I was too close to passing out.  It would've come out as, "Yousallz zselifz know wat I feel likew?: Yeahfl....."  so I decided to skip that.    Now, with my remaining day before class on Monday, I shall work as if I were getting paid for it.    Why do all the people who make excercise equipment act as if they were hopped up on crack?  Why do I care?  Why are you still reading this?  The only excuse for todays post is that I wanted to write something and couldn't think of anything to say.    As long as you're here, you should read what AJ wrote.......I know I said it was good before, but now it confuses me a little.  If you can tell me what's happening, email me at jnickgould@aol.com and tell me what I missed and I'll......Uhhhhhh..........Never mind.  Go america........When you have nothing good to say, say this.
