Someone tell me for the love of God it'll be better when I get back.  forgot that anti-Tag Board i used to have, so i'm jsut gonan get one. I have Live Journal, so it can conveniently link straight to thsi site!  Why? Because blogger is where is at!  jaysus this haircut....**makes i just ate a lemon face**  My arm itches....  At about 2 o clock in the morning Desi called and we talked to nearly three.  you know what i've noticed, (is hearing Hey Ya in backgorun) these stadiums in Portugal play AMERICAN music. And a lot of dance shit.   Today is Holland vs. Sweden, gotta pull for the man, the myth, the legend, the manc.   RUUD VAN NISTELROOY! Holland on the up. Greeks eliminated France yest.   Shayan's a retard. erm....  that's all I got for now I guess...more on my arm itching later.
