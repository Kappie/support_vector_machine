Not because the extra money could help. Not to show me the value of a dollar, help me if I didn't know that.  She's just being a selfish lil prick. It's almost always about her.    Tribute, because hearing the song makes things a little bit better.    The song we sang, on that fateful night, didn't actually sound anything like this song!
