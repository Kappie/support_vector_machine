Anyway, you're not here to listen to me complain about the internet, u wanna know whats going on in my life a.k.a. the Jamie show! (this episoded featuring a guest appearance by James)  So, yesterday. I was at work for most of the day doing crappy jobs for a pissed off boss. so you can see why i jumped at the chance to "go drinkin'" and it lived up to all my expectations!  We started the night in chelmer village, trying to get everyone to get off their asses in asda car park and go get some drink. After about 15 mins of everyone saying lets go, we went. The non-drunken walk into town was ok, but as always it took 4 years (y'know, give or take) but we passed the time by commenting on how every other sentance sarah says is a dumb blonde comment. (even though she has dark hair) Once we got into town, we decided to hit the co-op in molsham street, to try and get served. This was the plan -  Me and Mike Bignall would go in, pickup what we want and if they asked for I.D. i would say "i didnt think i'd need it" and mike would produce his fake ID.  yeah, it didnt work! they didnt accept that form of ID. so we went to molsham wines who, as paul so adeptly put it "would serve a 7 year old if he had the money" we got a crate of bud and some poffy drinks for the girls. The next destination on our bowl-fest was 24 hour tescos. We went in for more beerand i decided that it would look better if i payed for it on my own, so mike headed off into the freezer section and i went to what i thought was a nice young person on the tills. turns out she was nearly 40 and looked very good for her age! she asked me for ID and when i didnt have any she called her manager over who said "nah he looks like one or my mates, i'd say about 19" That made me smile! and naturally i milked it for all i could, saying that people always say how young i look for my age and such!  Anyways, after that we just went drinking in a field (john shennons or something) and not alot happened. Just some good old bonding and much photo taking. check out www.p00p.co.uk and this one http://www.p00p.co.uk/gallery.php?d=2004/06-June/26/=Bum-Boys.JPG  Good times!!  We ended the night with everyone going for cheesy chips. By the time we reached the army and navy, it was just me and joe.... so we went for more beer! all we could get was mankey stella though, so i didnt drink many, only about 4 or 5. We ate our chips on this boat, i think its the muddy waters, at like half 1 in the morning! it was great! The best bit being when the chef walked in on us (we just got on and drank and ate not their food) and just said   "........ i'll leave you to it then" and we were left there untill they closed!  The walk home took approximatly 4 seconds, and me and joe stopped on the roundabout and in a playpark (the playpark was great, spinning everywhere!)before stumbling in at half 2 in the morning. joe crashed on my couch, and i came down and woke him up real early, as is the custom after i drink!! I think thats all i want to put in here, check joes blog for details that i missed!  today was not great... i spent alot of it asleep and as a result, i will not sleep tonight!!!!  -(long post huh?)-  see ya next time, same veg time, same veg channel  Keep it safe,  Veg  P.S. Those of u who know about my uhh... problem i have, should know that i think ive made some good progress. its getting clearer what i should do.
