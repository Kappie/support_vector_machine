I had no tv. there wasn't a radio station i could understand - I never picked up a paper. I was totally isolated from the happenings of the world. or so it seems. I am so tied up with information that its hard to just look beyond all the 'news' and see how the world really is. I think they only way to do that is to go to places. I am really looking for adventure most of the time. some sort of new challenge. I will have to visit india some day.
