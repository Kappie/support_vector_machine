Attended my first lecture at QUT and I think the studying style here is quite different from Singapore.   Anyway, txtbook here is real expensive. Saw a "Digital communication" whichI used last semester for SC205. That txtbook cost AUD$98 here!   So, I am looking around for 2nd hand txtbook. Supposed to meet up with one student to buy a 2nd hand txtbook but he didn't meet up. So far so good, Michelle's (my housemate) friends are here for a week of holidays. They are leaving tom because school starts next week for them in Sydney n Melbourne.   Yun arriving on Sunday andshe is bringing over some of my stuff to brisbane. Really thankful to her. ( are you readin this, haha)Hmm, should I go fetch her on Sunday?   Internet connectionat homestill not up yet. I got loads of photos, finding time to upload into server so it will be available ya.   Been doing some cooking at home, making black beans n peanuts soup today. Now i realisedthe effort needed to do the cooking and the washing up. But i still enjoy cooking. Hmm, think will cook redang chicken one of these days.   Alrighty, got to go. Meeting another student to buy txtbook. Hopefully this guy turned up ya. See you later
