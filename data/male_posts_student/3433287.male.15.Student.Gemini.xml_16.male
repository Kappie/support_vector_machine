Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  yeah, something like that (The Beatles, A Day In Life) but except mine would go more like  shut up, im still asleep, ........................ ............................. ................................. ..........................  .......................... ..................... ............................ ............................zzz  well its 9:14, and i still ahve to get dressed and brush my teethand stuff before work at 9:30...hmm, maybe i should go do that....or maybe i should keep delaying:) 9:15 now, not to mention the fact that i am extremely tired, my lowr back hurts (if you have seen S2, feels like the part whre he falls through the clothes lines...) and have to dig all day, Yay! I love work! School is awsome! alright, i cant even subject myself to any more lies...damn...bastards
