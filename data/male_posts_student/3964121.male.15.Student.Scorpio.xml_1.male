When I was asked whether I was going to Klondike days, I answersed like this:   " Of course, I really want to spend a week searching for expensive unsafe rides and listening to bands that I wouldn't listen to anyways."  Though the last part is a lie (since I do listen to Sam Roberts, but that's it), I do believe all of this. Klondike days is a place in which unprepared rides are sold for ridiculously high prices. That is it. This was my rant.  The Protagonist is out.
