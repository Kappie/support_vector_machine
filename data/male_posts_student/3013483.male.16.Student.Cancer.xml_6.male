"Please," I ask this acquaintance of mine, "Buy a drink that will do it for me..."  I struggle to down it as I choke back the tears I had been with her for three whole years Then she walked out after firing some jeers. The pain she left me in doesn't ache but sears What I did to deserve this I just don't see.   This is another one from the old site that's just a "part of a whole".  I didn't end up finishing it 'cause I didn't really like how I started.  Anyway there it is.
