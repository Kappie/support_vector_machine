The camping week was actually very very fun and enjoyable. I really did like it. No, really, I did. But first, the bad things.  Because Baker Lake is so far away and some people in our family are drama queens and are stupid, my younger second cousins Catherine, Addie (Who I’m not related to, but is Catherine’s friend and has been coming to the camp-out for about seven years now), Maggie, and Justine that I always hang out with and have fun with weren’t there. It sucked. Camp-out and the family Christmas party are the only times I ever get to see those guys.  Friday or Saturday, I think, my brother helped my dad and my Uncle Mick do some little chore, and as a reward, Mick tossed John a Coors Light. My parents said that he could go ahead and drink it. Dude.... fuck. I’m 70% sure that it wasn’t John’s first experience with alcohol, considering his punk rock lifestyle, but just the fact that my parents were okay with their eighteen-year-old son downing a silver bullet made me want to kick them in the shins. Then, in order to be equal, my mom offered me one. I just... I just wanted to vomit all over her face. I’m sixteen! Six-fucking-teen! I’ve only been a teenager for four years and still have four years to go, and they offer me that shit? Ugh.  I’m sorry. Camp-out is basically one big drunk-fest, so I’ve learned to not care about my parent’s drinking, but dude...  Mosquitoes were not as bad as last year, but they were still present and still made it Itchfest 2004.   She talks like I know what she's talking about.   Okay, I know I’m going to make some enemies for this. I know some of my friends will completely doubt my sense of what good music is, but... Franz Ferdinand? I’ll pass. Okay, the way Kit and Natalie and everybody else in the fucking world talk about Franz Ferdinand, they make it seem like they are this godlike band that could make peace throughout the world by simply playing one note. But to me, they found themselves way way way below the hype. They just sound like another one of “those” bands. (Other “those” bands include Interpol, Rapture, and the Strokes). I won’t lie, “Take Me Out,” is fantastic and “Dark of the Matinee,” and “Michael,” are both special, but overall the CD just did nothing for me. Actually, it gave me a headache while we were driving up to Baker Lake.  I could lie and just jump on the bandwagon and say that I love them, but I don’t care if it makes me the uncoolest kid on this side of the Mississip’, I’m not gonna go to their concert. I’m in for BK, because it’s been so long, but Franz? Sorry. Nope.  Okay, but, dude, okay, dude, whoa. Right now, since I can’t do the real thing, I am hugging my two pillows and calling them Kit and Natalie. Why would I be doing this? Because of Charm School. By Bishop Allen. HOLY SHITTING JESUS! I love it. I love it all. I listened to the Cd nonstop during camp-out. Every day and night, there it was in my Cd player. I don’t think I could pick a favorite if you were holding a gun to my head. I love it all like it is my own. They’re coming in the fall, right? RIGHT? TELL ME! I’m in if they are.   A stranger thinking out loud in a foreign tongue.   Seriously, a lot happened over the week. So I’m just going to try and write as much as I can. It’s probably going to be extremely out of order, so just bear with me for a while.  John and Sarah came for the whole week this time. I really love Sarah. Not a jealous kind of love, but a brotherly kind of love. She’s really, a fun gal and I hope that John marries her so I can have a kick ass sister-in-law.  My cousin Megan brought her new boyfriend Jonathan. Again, I hope they get married. Jonathan is a musician and looks like what James Mercer would look like if he had red hair. I think Kit would faint at the sight of this man. He brought his acoustic guitar and graced us all to his music. His voice was crazy good. Kind of raspy and quiet and crazy pretty. And he was pretty shy, but when he talked, he was hilarious, so I loved him.  And another relationship paragraph. Adam, my cousin who I think I’ve talked about before brought his girlfriend Danni along. Before they showed up, his parents said that he was bringing his sixteen-year-old girlfriend. Adam? He’s eighteen. I thought that was a bit creepy at first, but she’s a really cool girl and they were cute together. Oh, wait, Adam is turning nineteen in September. Okay, that's weird. She's a sweet girl, though.   And while I knew she couldn't stay, I guess I never heard her leave.   I’m starting to have second thoughts about this whole dating thing. I don’t know, I hate feeling like I’m missing out on something, and not dating feels like a pretty big hole in my life. If I don’t have practice relationships right now, how will I know what to do when I have real relationships in the future?  Meh.  I went back to bed just now because I was getting sleepy and I wanted to think about that a little bit. I thought about it a lot, and I think the only reason I would want a girlfriend is for one thing: Having someone to hold in my arms while I’m sitting on the couch watching television. Watching movies and Tv shows and not having to talk very loud because I could just whisper in her ear.  Whatever. Let us move on.   I'm down with you, even on the eve of destruction.   I didn’t enter the horseshoe tournament this year once again, because I think that game is ridiculous and stupid. I did enter the cribbage tournament. Megan was picked as my partner and we lost our second game. Damn you Su and Karen. My brother and cousin Rachel were partners and they made it all the way up to the championship game. Then they lost. Ha. I learned how to play cribbage when I was eleven, and I entered the tournament and hey, I won. The youngest cribbage champ in the history of our camp-out, I am.   I met up with my common sense.   There was something really different about this year. Something that has never happened before. Bears! There were bears! On Tuesday morning the camp hosts found a Brown Bear cub sleeping in front of the store. They followed a trail back and found a lady who said something broke into one of her coolers. Apparently, that little bear cub opened her coolers and bit open all the beer and pop cans and drank as much as he could. He wasn’t sleeping in front of the store. They learned that he was actually passed out in front of the store. I laughed so hard when I heard that. It sounded like something from right out of the Simpsons.  By the time the Fish and Wildlife people arrived at the camp, the bear had stirred. He woke up and stumbled over to the area with the cabins and showers and climbed up a tree. He was up there for about five hours just lazing around while the Fish and Wildlife people stood around and stared at it.  Later in the day, Danni went down to the area to take a shower. When she emerged all clean and sparkly, to her left was the Mommy bear. Then the baby bear ran down to the beach and the people didn’t know what to do.  There were more encounters with the bears, but I want to move on once again.   At least ghosts are good company.   I won two 31 games which earned me about ten dollars in change. Perfect for poker on Saturday night. Lynn, Kim, John, Adam, Other Guy, and I were in on the action. We played some rounds of Texas Hold’em and Three Card Monty and 5 Card Draw. And I learned some really cool new games. Acey Ducey, Follow the Queen, and Shit On Your Neighbor. It was lots of fun, and I ended with about two more dollars than I started with, so Ha all over you. Friends, we need to play poker sometime. It doesn’t have to be for money or anything, I have some poker chips that we could use, and I’d teach you all I know. It would be dandy fun!   We kept playing the part where she's letting me go.   The ride home was so so so painful. Between Baker Lake and my Grandma’s house, the police had to shut down the freeway because two guys pulled over to the side of the road and started a fist fight. But that fist fight ended with one guy getting stabbed and the other getting shot. That added an extra hour to that part of the trip. Then after a quick stop at my grandma’s house, we headed on home. Unfortunately, there was a huge brush fire on I-5 and we were part of a complete stand-still for two hours. Everybody had turned off their engines and were just hanging out on the road and on the side of the road, waiting for them to start letting cars through. It was a pretty surreal experience to get out and walk around on a big freeway like that.  We had left Baker at noon and didn’t get home until 7:00PM. It was crap.   Every single day I swore we'd eventually be penitentiary bound.   I called Robin when I got home and once again, we were going to attempt to see Napoleon Dynamite. I was optimistic that we were actually going to make it this time, since I got to Robin’s at about 9:00 and the movie was at 10:15. But nope. Joel had to go to his house to get his mom’s SUV and he didn’t get there until about 9:30ish. And Joel decided to take us on an adventure and take every possible wrong turn between Robin’s house and the movie theater. It was hilarious, but eventually my head started to hurt and I was hella hungry because I hadn’t eaten anything since we left Baker Lake that morning.  By 10:30, we still hadn’t reached Fox Tower. And we were still getting lost. So we went to get food at this place called Pizza Oasis that was really heavenly.  I think we’re going to try to see the movie again for the fourth time today. If we miss it again, I’m giving up.   Because she sounded like a symphony when she simply said my name.   I haven’t seen Jenny in a long time. I should call her. I miss her.
