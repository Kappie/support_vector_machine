Back when I was a young lad  Jesus, Drew, you're not even 30 yet...quit acting like such a goddamned geezer , we had tons of "strictly tag teams".  So without further ado...   #1--The Midnight Express ("Sweet" Stan Lane  "Beautiful" Bobby Eaton):   This team had the coolest music, one helluva manager, and some of the smoothest scientific moves for a heel tag team.  Jim Cornette would always hit the ring first to introduce them, cuz no ordinary ring announcer could do them justice.  "Ladies and Gentlemen, get ready for the greatest tag team ever, twin brothers from seperate mothers..."  and stuff like that.  My favorite memory of them was seeing them defeat Tully Blanchard  Arn Anderson for the NWA tag team belts. I think I became a fan of theirs when they began their long, drawn out feud with the Rock n' Roll Express, who were nothin' but a couple pretty boys who deserved to have their teeth kicked in.   #2--The Road Warriors (Hawk  Animal):  Only because you can't mention great tag teams without mentioning them.  'Nuff said.   #3--Demolition (Ax  Smash):  This team still goes down in history  as the longest running Tag Champs in WWF/E history.  At first, they were considered the Fed's cheap ripoff of the Road Warriors. And to be fair, they probably were.  But over the months, they were able to gain the respect of fans like myself and the writers with their pure brutality in the ring.  It took a chair shot from Arn Anderson (there I go mentioning Tully  Arn again) to end their year and a half title run.  They would have a couple more turns with the belt though.   By the time they brought in Crush as a third member, it was pretty much over.  But it was great while it lasted.     #4--(tie)The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith  Dynamite Kid) and the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart  Jim Neidhart):   I consider this a tie because they were the top two teams in thier time.  I always enjoyed their matches.   #5--Lex Luger  Barry Windham:   This was a relatively short  lived team, but one of the loudest pops I ever heard at a live show ever was when they beat Tully  Arn for the tag team belts.  I still have pictures of that match somewhere.   The team broke up a few months later when Barry swerved on Lex, joined the Four Horsemen, and  handed the belts back to Tully  Arn.    #6-- The Mulkeys...just kidding...   #6--Tully Blanchard  Arn Anderson:   Of course I was to get to them.  I didn't realize what an impact on tag team wrestling they had until I started writing this thing.  Seems like a lot of my favorite Tag Team moments involved them in one way or another.  Either as members of the Four Horsemen in NWA, or as the Brainbusters in WWF, their no-nonsense, hard hitting style made them one of the best tag teams ever.  It's also worth noting that they were the first team to ever hold both the NWA/WCW and WWF tag team title.  (The Road Warriors were the second).   #7--Rick and Scott Steiner:   This was back before Scott Steiner bulked up and became The Genetic Freak.  Back in the day, Scotty was the master of all forms of suplexes, and practically invented the Frankensteiner (aka Hurricarana).  Scotty was the high flyer, while Rick "The Dog-faced Gremlin" was the brutal mat wrestler.  I'm sure they had a match or two with Tully and Arn, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.  (They were also the third team to hold both World straps).    I'd include the Dudley's on this list, but seeing as how they have plenty of life left in them, there's still a lot of history for them to make.  Also gaining honorable mention are the New Age Outlaws, The Hardyz, Edge  Christian, Beavis  Butthead (oh, wait a sec...),  and The Brothers of Destruction.
