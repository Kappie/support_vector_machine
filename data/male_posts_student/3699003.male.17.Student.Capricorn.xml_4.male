Johnson  I am lost in the darkness My eyes are blind, I cannot see Lord, give me a new found life So I can see clearly    Chorus:   Vision of beauty You've called me and led me Taken from darkness, brought into your light Vision of glory You've told me and shown me Revealing your presence The depth of your love   I am lost in the darkness My ears are deaf, I cannot hear Lord, give me a new found life Let me know you are near   Chorus   I am lost in the darkness My senses dead, I cannot live I need a new found life Lord, I know you forgive.   Chorus
