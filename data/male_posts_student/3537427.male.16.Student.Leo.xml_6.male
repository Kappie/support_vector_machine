There was one good part about the 4th and that was lightin 12 bottle rockets at once. The following are SOME of the things that sucked: WENT TO MY AUNTS TO SEE ROSS, HE WASNT THERE YET. IT WAS BORING. WE LEFT BEFORE HE GOT THERE. WE WERE GOING TO GO BACK, WE DIDN'T. WE WENT TO RON AND JULIES TO SWIM... I HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT SWIMMING IS NOT VERY FUN AFTER DOING IT FOR 18 STRAIGHT WEEKS. THEY HAVE SATELLITE TV... 999 CHANNELS, NOTHING ON. ONCE AGAIN, IT WAS BORING. SO EVENTUALLY WE LEFT. WE WENT TO WORK TO GET MY SCHEDULE... THEY FORGOT TO PUT ME ON THERE. WHEN I GOT HOME THE ANNOYING FIREWORKS HAD ALREADY STARTED  So I decided to go to sleep. I put in my new Thursday CD and was out before Understanding In A Car Crash came on.(thats about 33 seconds into the CD)  SO here I am on what will probably be the highlight of my 4th of July weekend. And thats all I've got.  Out like the fat kid in dodge ball, ...Ryan...
