Anyways, she's got her own little blog thingy I guess, looking at the site she included in her letter. I have no idea if I should look at it or not. Again my head, the one containing my 'thinking' brain, tells me one thing and my heart screams another. WTF should I do!?! God help me. I don't think I'm gonna look, part of me thinks there's more bad in it than good, and I'll learn more bad things about myself from her than I already know. I think I just blew a couple braincells cause suddenly my head hurts. Oh, well. I'm still not sure what to do about Lauren. again my Head(thinker) and Heart are screaming different things. Kinda like the angel/devil on the shoulder thing. I really can't wait for school to start. Seriously, and I can't beleive I just said that. I wish I were a bear. One of those ones that those "manly guys" hunts with a big gun. Then all I'd ever have to worry about would be eating, sleeping, and being in the wrong place at the right time so I can get shot. Oh how fun. I'm still tired, and I have no clue why i just can't go to sleep. I tried about an hour ago. Do I still have feelings for her........no, I couldn't,..........could I? ( god, would you please cast downa stone and be sure it hits me in the FREAKIN HEAD!!! )
