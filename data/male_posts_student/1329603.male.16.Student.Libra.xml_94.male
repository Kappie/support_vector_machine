I believe I put more effort into this than most people. It's like writing an essay about my life. "The alliteration in this sentence shows that I was bloody narked off."'  That was possibly the coolest thing I've EVER said in my life. Seriously. Heh, I used to be cool. Where'd that go...  Love, Jon Roskilly
