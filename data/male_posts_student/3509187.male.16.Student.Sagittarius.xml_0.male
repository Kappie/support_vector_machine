I was looking at my page and saw the comment at the top under the title and decided Miss Pangborn would be very proud of my wandering mind... or as she says meandering thoughts... and when I thought of her I thought of this movie thats coming out June 11 that looks like one of the funniest movies in the world... Napoleon Dynamite... its going to be great... go to http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/napoleon_dynamite.html to see the preview... you will pee your pants it so funny... If you think its funny then let me know and we'll have to go see it when it comes out. Umm I guess thats all I had to say, maybe I'll find some pictures now...  Dan V
