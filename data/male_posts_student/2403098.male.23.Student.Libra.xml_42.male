You know, a link to a page that contains some pictures, maybe updated at times, some fun stuff posted about myself, etc?  Yes? No? None of the above?  I might work on that. I might also not work on it and allow it to be like folding laundry: something I say I am going to do in my spare time but never seem to get around to caring about.
