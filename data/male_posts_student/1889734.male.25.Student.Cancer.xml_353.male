The fifth book is only out in hardcover, which is well beyond what I'm willing to pay, so now it is time to switch to a new series.  This is another one I found on the Baen Free Library, and I've mentioned it before.  It takes place during the reign of Justinian (530ish AD).  It seems that what Man has become in the far future has sent back one of thier own to try to change history for some reason still not known.  They set themselves up in India, and use that as a base to destroy the Holy Roman Empire.  An opposition force has sent back what is essentiall a super computer inside a crystal (small enough to be worn on a necklace) to try to oppose the Indians.  This finds its way to Belasarius, one of the greatest generals in world history.  From there we are into standard Really Big Wars and Technology Out of Place in Time (TM).  Entertaining, but in a guily way.  Just like the Ringo books, it reminds of some of the mindless stuff I read as a teenager.  Great escapist stuff.
