I cannot help it, it comes directly from my thoughts. Enjoy these two new poems I have written :)    Mindful Warning   A shred of light, as it tears me apart, A feeling of courage with all that is myself, To be given the strength to go on each day, Relies strictly on my focus and effort  An indication of reliance, what is the point? Reliance is strictly trust, and trusting oneself can break apart. An imaginative highlight of the mind, a deathly pull on the soul. To encompass a true vision is somewhat impossible  To subconciously change a thought to what you want it to be, Is severity in it's worst form, and is meaningless devotion. A wish of paradise, searching for the likes, Affection is nothing but a pointless emotion  Depriving me of a thought I wish to share, On a level of intellect, I can search and find it To criticise my style, and way of wisdom, Is nothing but pure atrocity.  To animate the lives of everyone, To switch points and turn it against oneself, Is what makes this world, what it is, Disappointing misery, a changing toll of life  Mistaking a lie for truth, and mistaking the truth for the reality, Guilds us and bounds us to this place we call home, Surely it does seem the way that can be bad, Who is one to tell the difference?  Everything is overrated, everything is a lie Lying in bed at night, thinking of what will happen next The hill is growing steeper, We don't give a damn.  © 2004 Tyler Kuhk  This poem basically expresses my disgust, in not only everyone else, but myself as well in that we do nothing to improve society and all of it's many flaws.    Doomed   A blissful realization; a tempest of doom Reactions are different; visions of gloom Pocket your thinking; notice the sight, Everything is melancholy; nothing is right, Escape from the fury, return to the hell, See through its lies; seek and do tell.  Atracting its prey; tolerating its movement Adapting to change; accepting it's testament Illogical messes; justifying grace, Virtuous fiction; leaves us with a chase Skeptics cause dysfunction; an imminent trait, Caressing the thought, we are nothing but bait.  Gracious contemplation; a result from the thought, Is that of a wise person; a wise person taught. Understanding the depression; comprehending the hate, The future of this world, relies on nothing but fate. The destroyed forces within, interested in our well-being Shouldn't care anymore, for what they have been seeing  We've gone to far, and dug ourselves in, too deep. With the effects of our actions, others, now weep.  © 2004 Tyler Kuhk  This one is along the same lines as the first. Showing our struggle with reality, and the world itself, and how our actions affect everyone else.  I guess that's all I will write for tonight. The contemplative mood is still evident, as I can feel it. I will definately write some more poems later today.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Talk to you all later.
