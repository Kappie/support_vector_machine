It is made from the extracts of dead sharks, but more research is needed to find the actual repellent molecule. Dead sharks have been known to repel live sharks for a long time, but now there is a repellent called A-2 that is being studied. It is so powerful that it can even repel sharks in a feeding frenzy. So far, "Tests have found the repellent effective on four species: the Caribbean reef, blacknose, nurse and lemon sharks."  I really hope that this receives adequate research and a product is distributed as soon as possible. I feel a little put out that the scientists want to protect the sharks first. Forget saving the humans with this product, let's work on a way to save sharks with it. Sheesh. That's for another post though...
