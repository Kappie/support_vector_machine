You see at first I thought one door led to the destruction of the matrix along with Trinity and the robots but saved Zion and the other door led to the destruction of Zion but the saving of Trinity and the Matrix, and 23 people would be able to restart Zion. Now I know, the door Neo didn't choose was the door all the other ones chose, the door to the restart of Zion and the Matrix and 23 people from the Matrix to restart Zion. All the ones had to deal with love but never loved their love as much as Neo did and Neo believed that he could save Trinity along with Zion if he picked the other door. So he picks the door which leads to the complete destruction of the human race but saving Trinity. This would also lead to the destruction of all robots because without humans or sun, the robots cannot survive. Then again the architect did say there are other means of survival for AI. Neo picked the door not traveled because he had faith that he was Jesus, you saw him in the real world, he destroyed the sentinals in the real world which doesn't prove there's "a matrix in a matrix" for all you assholes out there, it proves Neo is Jesus and that he can save Zion and destroy every robot.   General Summary   - The First door leads to the destruction of Zion and restart of the Matrix, 23 people from the Matrix to restart Zion (not including Trinity and she dies in the Matrix)          This door was chosen by the last 5 "Ones" - The Second door leads to the total extinction of the human being which leads to the end of AI (Architect said there's other ways for AI to survive)          Neo picks this door - Neo is the only one who picks the second door because he was the only one who loved someone so much and had so much faith (He's Jesus) - Neo kicks ass in real world too... which obviously means destruction of robots, saving the world - The dude in the end of Reloaded on the table was Agent Smith inside Bane (Dun Dun Dun!) - Neo and the rest of Zion now have 24 hours in Revolutions to wipe out the attack on Zion and shut down the matrix... screw all the people living in it!  Wow, ok I got that out of my system. That's what really happened. Now I'm done.
