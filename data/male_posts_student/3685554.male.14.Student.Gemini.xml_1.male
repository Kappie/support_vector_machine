Notably and claimed as a free thinker but in a way a christian I was quite surpriesed and irked by the way this book depicted Christ and about the Holy Grail. Who knows whether it is true or not but I being christian, I'm quite against this ideology that Christ was not divine but just pure human. But then this book certainly could cliam its righteous position of #1 International Best Seller for its great contenta nd suspense. A thumbs up for it. Religiously, it's different.
