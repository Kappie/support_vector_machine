The day of the elections I knew the name of 2 of the main candidats. Not more. I was not obsessed by the elections, but I watched enough tv to have been able to know them all if their promotion was decent.  Ofcourse, you should not vote for people but the groups who support them. I'm a left winger but what the left wing groups did not have anything to say. They said "this is wrong and that is wrong" but they didn't give solutions. The right wing groups did the same. But they were giving solutions. But I don't think Holland should leave the EU nor that there should be many rules to keep foreigners out. Don't get me wrong, the right wing politicians weren't very clear about their points of view but clearer than the left wing politicians.  There were other groups too. Some guy who didn't have anything to say except that everything was wrong in Brussels. He got more than 7% of the votes.  But there were even bigger losers. The Party for the Animals. Their points: European constitution? As long as there are animal rights in it. No more animals used for entertainment etc. etc..  If I will ever meet somebody of that group I will kick my foot through her (most of the members are female)ass out of her mouth. I mean please, you can be ignorant but these people add a new dimension to it. When was the last time an animal (except a pet animal) did anything good for you except providing foot and milk? That's right, they made you laugh. In the circus or on television. For the rest nobody gives a fuck about those animals. Thank God those wankers just got 3% of the votes (they needed 3.7% to have the right to send one person to the parliament). I want to fuck those pussies up, you know. Perhaps the last thing I'd say to a party member (before I'd treat them like dogs) would be: I want to fuck you like an animal...
