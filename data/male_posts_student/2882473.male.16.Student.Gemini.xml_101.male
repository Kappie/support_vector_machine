Today was an ok day; seeing as I actually went out. In the morn I went to Bromley with my mum and oldest sister to look for a suit for me to wear next year at school. We had to look round for ages, as most suits were at least size 40, and those of you who know me will realise that I am nowhere near that. So, after looking in Marks and Spencer, Next, Burtons, BHS and Debenhams, we eventually found a nice little shop in the heart of the Glades Shopping Centre called ‘Suits You’, as you know doubt have already guessed, a suit shop. With loads of sizes! We settled for the smallest one they had, a size 34 dark navy jacket and trousers for… £150! £150!!! Can you believe that?!?! Sooooo expensive. But we were all fed up and tired, so that’s what we got. Oh, and I also bought some new swimming trunks, even though I still don’t like swimming. Oh well, I suppose it’s just something you need even if you never use them.   Came home, and didn’t do a lot else. However, there is a little good news in the generally depressing life of Dave. I finally convinced my mum that dial-up internet is not really practical in this day and age, so together (with the help of good  urlLink Megatrobe ) we ordered BT 512K for £17.99/month (I think) for the first year, then £25.99 after that. So fairly good. The modem should be arriving one week tomorrow. What’s the betting that something will go wrong? I reckon at least evens. But if I’m very lucky, in a week and a day, I should be blogging through a nice reliable fast internet connection. Whether it will turn out to be either of these waits to be seen :)   Also been learning Esperanto, as you all already know. Oh, and if some strange foreign person who I don’t know in the slightest who found my blog whilst searching for ‘Harry Potter’ or something just as random can also speak Esperanto, please leave a comment or email me. This doesn’t include you nonnesuch, even if you do seem a little strange at some times; I’m fairly sure you’re not foreign.  :)  Dave’s done for now. (Hm, maybe that should be my new finishing phrase, like dickybod’s ‘G’[insert random time of day]’, or Stompp’s ‘Stommp out’   Weather:  Some cloud, some sun  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves (wow, they've both been going a while)  Listening to:  Robin Hood's 'Oo-de-lally' :)  Watching:  Old Friends, Malcom in the Middle  Confused about:  Why they don't sell small suits  Annoyed with:  Suit makers  Mood:  Ever so slightly peeved
