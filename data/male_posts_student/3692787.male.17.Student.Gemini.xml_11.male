I've listened to it for the nth time this morning and it's still stuck in my head. It's not as deep or thought-provoking as, say, Stellar by Incubus or She Will be Loved by Maroon 5; it's fairly straightforward. I like the violin though, it's a nice touch, it adds a nice melancholy feel to the whole thing... Hay naku, makinig nga kayo ng Yellowcard! Sana gawin nilang single yan, you'llknowwhat I mean.  Pupunta dapat ako ng SM North ngayon para tumambay (hopefully with my out-of-school buds fromThird Year who do nothing but smoke weed and play video games andparticipate in orgiesall day long. Oh, I'm not into stuff like that, I'm just in it for the games. It's all about the games, people), pero tinatamad ako. Merong sportsfest ang MMC ngayon at naimbitahan ang lahat sa block namin, pero hindi na ko pumunta, tinatamad ako.  I just wanna stay home, log on every so often, lie down, play video games, and listen to Yellowcard and Dashboard Confessional. Is that so wrong? I hope not.  completely wrong thought of the day: ARGH! My enter key sticks!
