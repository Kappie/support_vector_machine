Now it's out of the way and I can enjoy my day with no impending sense of deadlines! Well, at least no fitness-related deadlines (work is another story). I don't like doing my exercise at night. It means I can't relax at home; I'm always watching the clock to see when I have to get to the gym. At night the gym  interrupts  my day, and keeps me up late; in the morning the gym  jump starts  my day and gives me energy.  I don't think there's a question here.  Before pic is up (left column, scroll down). I'm pleased to see that I don't look nearly as bad as I did in the 2001 Before pic. I look much closer to the after pic -- and, comparing it to my 2001 interim photos, I most resemble week 7 or 8.  :-)  So I don't have to do too much to get back to where I was. (This reminds me of high school. Over summer break you forget everything, and then spend a couple of months in the fall reviewing.)       Today's Meals    Protein drink, bagel, little bit o' cream cheese Turkey sandwich Protein drink, red grapes Turkey sandwich with spinach Steak burrito from Panchero's ("Cheese?" "Un poquito!")
