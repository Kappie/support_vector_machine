So Tyke should probably talk about his day now seeing as that is what this blog is.  Well today Tyke had to get up early of course cuz he was going to go make up days for weight training.  He got a little over 7 hours of sleep cuz he had the concert and all last night but Tyke is someone who needs about 11 hours to really feel good.  Even though he is still tired then.  Hmmm...whatever.  But today there was no make-up days for weight training so Tyke and Macaroon were left out with nothing to do.  So Tyke drove them to Krispy Kreme/Farget and they ate and listened to music.  But Tyke has been listening to his Val Emmich CD all day.  He really likes it.  The tunes are stuck in his head.  In a good way though.  Ok...back to the day.  Tyke and Macaroon came back to school and then the day began.  It was a easy day with it being Wednesday and all.  But in weight training Tyke didn't get to go out and play because he is smart and everyone else is stupid so he had to help people figure out the math for what their goals are for their maxes.  At lunch Amed and Dr. Phil joined Tyke at Mickey D's for some good McFlurrys and then it was off to the rest of the day.  Tyke finished a project for the first time in like a month in Graphics (he started it yesterday as well) and then he went out to roam like usual.  The junior girl (who was "sad she couldn't talk to him much in weight training") was out so she talked with Tyke for a little.  She's pretty cool.  Annnnyway the rest of the day went by fine.  After school was the time to pick up cap and gowns for seniors and that was a pretty long line.  But Tyke passed the time with Kinker and Macaroon and Triple Threat and then Tina joined in too.  After picking up the stuff Tyke and Tina went to the counseling office to pick up some stuff for her and then they walked and talked for a little about some stuff but nothing too long.  Then Tyke went home.  And he did laundry, prepared his speech, and found out some news about prom.  Since another person can't go to the hotel after the dance Tyke and Amed starting thinking about what to do.  It was stressful and annoying but they finally just dropped the second room they are getting and now it is one room for the group.  Macaroon helped out some in the decision but again Tyke and Amed made the decision by brute force.  That took a little while and pushed Tyke's practice time back too.  Cuz he had to help his mom out with stuff.  And he also put his cap and gown on and damn that looks pretty cool.  It looked like he was about to graduate or something.  But yeah Tyke practiced his speech for his mother, cuz she made him, and boy was it bad.  He told his mom that he was more nervous about doing it for her alone than he was for doing it for the panel.  She just kept looking at Tyke and she was like 2 feet away.  It was freaky.  So it was the worst and fastest he's done it ever and it was still over 9 minutes so he's fine.  It's gonna be easy.  But then Tyke spent about 20 minutes deciding which tie to wear with his suit.  He is now wearing a red, or power, tie with the blue shirt and black suit.  He's ever-so-handsome.  But then came the time when he had to take it off and blog.  So he did so.  Tomorrow Tyke gets to show his video for English and also do his presentation.  Then he is picking up his tux at 4 and if he can't get the fedora there he is gonna go to Northwest Costume in Redmond to get the hat there.  Yep, good times.  All's well now.  All is well.  Let's go.
