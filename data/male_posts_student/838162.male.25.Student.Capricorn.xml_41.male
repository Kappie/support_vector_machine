Studies are coming along although I’m a bit behind, especially in assignments. I booked my driving theory test, should be a piece of cake since, in a way, I have passed it before. Been exercising regularly and feeling good.  However there are a few low points; if you recall I have been getting strange computer freezes for the last two months or so. Now this is not healthy, for the computer or for me. I have narrowed down the problem to two areas, the power supply or the mainboard. But I needed to test my theories. So I moved the system outside to the main hall and used a power point there. Since I have already changed the power supply inside the system to no avail, this was the only other alternative. I then tested the system for 8 hours and it suffered no random crashes. My fears come through; there is a problem with the power supply from the wall socket of my room. Now I’m in a fix as to how to solve this. Should I just get the electrician to check the wall socket in my room? Or should I get him to install a new one closer to my system so that I don’t have to use any extension power strips? Any ideas?  Another low point was when I answered a somewhat personal question untruthfully on impulse. I consider the person who asked it to be a good friend and I had no intention to be dishonest with her. I just answered the first thing that came to mind, as it caught me by surprise and it was the easiest answer to give. Now I feel that I need to clear the air with her although she is unaware of my error. Perhaps I should call her.   >
