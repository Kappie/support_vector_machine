I also got an autograph and a death threat from Jason (Luckily for me, he didn't have a Minbari fighting pike with him at the time).  I did not buy her a tribble, although she did buy a tribble for her mom.  Ashley told me she likes me better than her birds, then Richard Biggs (B5's Dr. Franklin) asked me if she was my Lady.  Anyway, with all that, we're together now.  You can meet her at the speech meet on the tenth, or I  might  bring her to youth group sometime. Micheal: That only makes it funny when you're on Caffiene, which most of us aren't at the moment.  Also, what the heck does Schlammes mean? Jonah: I have a statue of Emperor Palpatine.  Would you like to borrow it?  Oh, and cornblog is a stupid idea. Lara: Where can I get a copy of your book?  And will you sign it?
