But, if you know me at all, you'll know that I'm almost always either listening to or watching music. And, when I'm watching something other than music, there's almost always music playing in the background. No CD player around? Not a problem for me, because well...there's usually one of my favorite songs running through my head.        I guess before I get into why I listen to so much music, I should explain what music I tend to listen to...and there's no easier way in doing so then typing up a list of CDs I currently own. My fingers are going to be hurting...       :: Aerosmith- A Little South Of Sanity    :: AFI - Sing The Sorrow    :: The All-American Rejects - The All-American Rejects    :: Anavox - A New Voice    :: Audioslave - Audioslave    :: Blues Traveler - Four    :: Blues Traveler - Live From The Fall    :: Brand New - Deja Entendu    :: Breaking Benjamin - We Are Not Alone    :: The Calling- Camino Palmero    :: The Calling - Two    :: Steven Curtis Chapman - Speechless    :: Steven Curtis Chapman - Declaration    :: Creed - Human Clay    :: Creed - Weathered    :: Daredevil, The Album    :: Dashboard Confessional - A Mark...    :: Default - The Fallout    :: Default - Elocation    :: Earshot - Two    :: Evanescence - Fallen      :: Finch - What It Is To Burn  :: Finger Eleven - Finger Eleven    :: Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left To Lose    :: Foo Fighters - One By One    :: Fuel - Something Like Human      :: Fuel - Sunburn  :: Fuel - Natural Selection    :: Good Charlotte - The Young And The Hopeless    :: Goo Goo Dolls -A Boy Named Goo    :: Goo Goo Dolls - Dizzy Up The Girl    :: Guns N' Roses - Use Your Illusion    :: Guster - Lost And Gone Forever    :: Hoobastank - The Reason    :: Incubus - Make Yourself    :: Incubus - A Crow Left Of The Murder    :: Kutless - Kutless    :: Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory    :: Linkin Park - Reanimation    :: Linkin Park - Meteora    :: Linkin Park - Live In Texas    :: Live - Birds Of Pray    :: Lonestar - From There To Here, Greatest Hits    :: Lonestar - Let's Be Us Again    :: Lost Prophets - The Fake Sound Of Progress    :: Lost Prophets - Start Something    :: Matchbox 20 - Yourself Or Someone Like You    :: Matchbox 20 - Mad Season    :: Matchbox 20 - More Than You Think You Are    :: Matchbox 20 - EP    :: Dave Matthews - Some Devil    :: Modest Mouse - Good News For People Who Love Bad News    :: Muse - Absolution    :: New Found Glory - Catalyst    :: Nickelback - Silver Side Up    :: Nickelback - The Long Road    :: Pearl Jam - Vitalogy    :: POD - Satellite    :: Puddle Of Mud- Come Clean    :: The Punisher, The Album    :: The Rasmus - Dead Letters    :: The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Greatest Hits And Videos    ::The Red Hot Chili Peppers - By The Way    :: The Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication    :: Relient K - Two Lefts Don't Make A Right    :: REM - In Time, 1988-2003    ::Revis - Places For Breathing    :: Saliva - Every Six Seconds    :: Saliva - Back Into Your System    :: Seether - Disclaimer    :: Shrek Soundtrack    :: Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream    :: Snow Patrol - Final Straw    :: Spider-Man, Music From And Inspired By    :: Spider-Man 2, Music From And Inspired By    :: Staind - Dysfunction    ::Staind -BreakingThe Cycle    :: Staind - 14 Shades Of Grey    :: Stone Temple Pilots - Purple    :: Story Of The Year - Page Avenue    :: Switchfoot - Learning To Breathe    :: Thousand Foot Krutch - Phenomenon    :: Three Days Grace - Three Days Grace    :: Trapt - Trapt    :: Unwritten Law - Elva    :: U2 - Joshua Tree    :: U2 - Achtung Baby    :: Velvet Revolver - Contraband    :: WoW 2000    :: The Wallflowers - Bringing Down The Horse    :: Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue        So there you go, that's my CD collection as of July 16, 2003. As you can tell, most of it is rock...with the exception of a few country CDs thrown in there. Alli got me into that group, Lonestar. I listen to them whenever I miss her, like now, or whenever I'm feeling upset about things that are going on. But, I also listen to 'em to remind me of the great thing we have together, especially the song "Amazed" when it comes to that.        Anyway...rock. A lot of the real heavy or depressing rock, I'll listen to when I'm just that...depressed. If I'm really angry about something, or really sad about something, I'll put in something I can scream to and let loose...it usually helps. But, there is some rock (usually a little on the lighter side) that I listen to when I'm in good moods too. But, all in all, I usually just listen to it because I like how it sounds.        So, there ya go. I really didn't have anything to write today, so I just thought I'd get my music obsession out in the open...not that it wasn't already.
