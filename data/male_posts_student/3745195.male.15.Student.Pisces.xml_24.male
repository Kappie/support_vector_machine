Asian guy is totally hilarious and also Darius Miles is in it [from the Blazers]. Oh and the main character's name is Kyle so that was kool too.  Afternoon: Talked to Anisia and read "The Wedding" for a bit under my tree.  Night: I decided that I should go to church last night instead of waiting for this weekend and then I'll be leaving for camp. So I went last night and I showed up early so I sat down on a bench and read a couple pages from "The Wedding" and then Matt [the pastor] came up and told me I came at the most peaceful time and I agreed and then he said that he didn't know my name so I told him I was new and he got really excited. Then about fifteen minutes later Samie, Anisia and Tony showed up. So I gave Tony money to get some food from the barbeque and then after mingling with some of the kids for about 30 minutes we went inside and I just went inside and shot around until the service started. Then we all went and sat down and started singing. Then Matt got up and asked some of the kids to come up and share what they got out of camp. After everyone finished Matt went up and started speaking and then we all prayed and I got saved. After we all prayed we broke off into other small prayer groups. So first I went up with a group of older kids and they prayed for me and then I went over to Samie, Anisia, Tony and Josh [i think] and then we all prayed together and then Tony and I just walked around for a while and then Samie took me asides and prayed for me [Thank you Samie that meant a lot to me]. The we all just kind of hung out and then it was time to go, but I couldn't find my bag so I got a little scared, but eventually I found it and it was kind of funny because I realized that I had walked right by it before. lol Oh well so my mom called and ended up picking me up because it was dark.I feel like a big wheight has been lifted off of me.  Today  Morning: I went to Sunset for conditioning. Lavelle and Blair we're there. I kind of set pace, but lavelle was doing that mostly. Then I came home.  Afternoon now I'm here reading "The Wedding" and I might go see the Notebook today [if anyone wants to go then call me] I'll also be calling people that I would like to go. Well that's it for now.  Bye
