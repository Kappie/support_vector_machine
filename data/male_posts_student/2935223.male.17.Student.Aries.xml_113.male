I've been having a WONDERFUL day so far, sure I've only been awake for 1/2 an hour, but, gosh-darnit, I feel good. hm...it seems that this little incedent has affected WAY more people then it should've. If you are not directly involved, I wish for you to go to Brendan's blog and read his choice words of advice. I'm more pissed at myself now then any one else. I need breakfast.  Cinnamon Toast Crucnh sounds good.......Mmmmm*drool* oh ya, I leave for Utah in less than two days!  I don't wanna go, I'm gonna be really frickin' bored, meanwhile everyone's gonna be havin' fun back here in good ol' River Falls.  Dangit, I don't wanna go to Utah...I just wanna hang out with my friends. :-( Such is the price for being an ass hole.
