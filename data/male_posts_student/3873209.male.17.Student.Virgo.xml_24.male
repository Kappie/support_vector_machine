And of course, Eric just had to eat chips right in front of Fi who has a stomach ache-aren't we nice ppl? :P then we ate some spaghetti, fruitand drank some soft drink for lunch-with icecream for dessert which we all ate in front of Fi (mwahahaha!! no icecream 4 u!!) - wasn't the icecream great?! mmmmm yum!!  then we went thru making the 3 skits we performed today-haha kinda last minute but oh wellz -- if u dont know what it's about its about 2 kids (E and Kat), and Kat's listening to Ghetto Superstar... then E comes along, doesnt like the music and so takes the CD out and breaks it in front of Kat-yeah i told u we were nice ppl ^_^ then we had 3 different hilarious cut scenes where they forgive each other, dont forgive and the last where they pretend to forgive each other. I think performing these skits were the highlight of the forgiveness workshop today-yeah E and Kat are really funni ^^  As for the workshop overall? Well we kinda started 10 minutes late and the studies took a tad longer than we thought-the game were nice and humorous-(with some last minute modifications), which illustrated the principle of grace quite well. We didnt end up symbolically burning pieces of paper at the end-but otherwise the workshop went along pretty good :)  Yeah-was a good experience leading-and yeah now I'm bak home-kz bb!!
