Ever have that feeling like if you jump off of a building, you could fly? Well that is how I feel right now!  I get my car! My parents are getting me a 1990 Honda Accord. It is gold, with a brown interior. It is soo cool! It has less then 75,000 miles too! As a comparison: Our 1988 Subaru Wagon has 180,000+ miles on it, as apposed to my 1990 Honda Accord with less than 75,000 miles. It is owned by a little old lady who drives it to and from the store. I'm sooooooooooooooooooo in love!  So I spent the day cleaning out the garage with my mom. We are making room in our garage, so we can park all three cars. My dad was like:  "I don't know how we can fit three cars in here."  Um, it is a THREE car garage.    "I don't know people that park three cars in their three car garage."  Um, most people don't have as much crap as us.    Come on people. Do your parents collect papers? We have news papers from like last year in a stack in our garage. Does my dad read them? No. Why keep them? It is old news. Anything news worthy, you already know, and has passes. WTF? Why do people have to be so thick? Well, that was my day. OH, Blockbuster.  I hate Blockbuster. Why do I hate Blockbuster? I hate Blockbuster because they lie. They advertise, we will have it in stock or it is free. This is what I thought, so I go and want to rent American Wedding, because I'm a movie nerd and never get to see movies in the theater. But Iâ€™m getting better at that. So I yell at the lady at the counter about false advertising, and she said    "Well, it isn't a guaranteed movie." "Why advertise a guarantee if it isn't good on anything?"  She just stood there dumbfounded. Ugh. I hate Blockbuster. I will NEVER go there again. I will add it to my Don't Shop at List. Wal-Mart is also on that list.  Well, that is my day. Tomorrow I think I'm gonna finish my room. You can see the floor now!    Why doesn't Ryan get that I like him?
