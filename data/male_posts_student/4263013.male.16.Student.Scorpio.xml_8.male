Guy: Then tell me u Love me.  Girl:Ok, I Love u. Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.  *Girl hugs him*  Guy: Can u take my helmet off  put it on? Its  buggin me.   In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had  crashed into a building because of break  failure.   2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived. The truth  was that halfway down the road, the guy realized  that his brakes broke, but he didn't want 2 let  the girl know. Instead, he had her say she Loved  him  felt her hug 1 last time, then had her  wear  his helmet so that she would live even though it  meant that he would die. Now if there is anyone on here that you love and  care for that much, say to him or her I love you and be sincere about it...
