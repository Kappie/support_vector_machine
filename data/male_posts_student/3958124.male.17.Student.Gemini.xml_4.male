Do we really need to see that many snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, phirrana, crocodiles/alligators, sharks, whales, dolphins, monkeys, birds, kangaroos, and large cats? Honestly. Why do they have so many? I think it's all the animal sex that keeps people there. Animal shows have even penetrated the country's favorite mid morning talk-show, Regis and Kelly. I was watching the special episode this morning that showed all those wacky (their word, not mine) antics (their word) that Reg' and Kel' took part in this year. A tarantula crawled over Regis's head. The audience screamed a lot. Was it a "wacky antic"? No. It was a dumb white guy who doesn't know that if an animal can kill you, it's best to stay away from it. Now he's right up there with all the other cock blocking "croc' hunters". Big deal Regis. I wanted to be a Millionaire - you just didn't call on me.
