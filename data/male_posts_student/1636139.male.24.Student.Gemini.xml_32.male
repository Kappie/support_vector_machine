My roommate Kirill  I walked around to explore the complex. There are 3 heated swimming pools, none of which are very deep. The gym is not very good though, consisting of nothing but stationary bikes  treadmills. 
We only get a single parking spot but that should not pose a problem, since I don't drive anyway. 
  
The downside is that I live close to the San Jose airport so the sound of an aeroplane either landing or taking off shatters the air every couple of minutes. Fortunately, it hasn't interfered with my sleep. 
The neighbourhood is very much a suburban one, so the only thing with any semblence of civilization nearby is a tiny shopping centre. 
  
The bike I'd requested was already in the apt. when I got there but the tyres needed an air infusion so I biked over to the closest gas station last night. 
There's nothing quite like biking the wrong way on a highway in the dark to get that adrenaline flowing ;-)
