That's probably what we'll reminisce about, heh. Seriously though, they make data entry tolerable, and that's saying something.  Dave Matthews has the capability to do the same, though I haven't brought any of his albums up here. I need to.  Brian, post a comment that will tantalize my readers with your new campaign idea. It sounds bad to the bone (I'm a fan of 80s expressions. Radical!) I'm thinking I'll either play the mystic theurge from your Cormyr game, or a dagger-throwing superspy (think a good version of T'kal's minion, The Dagger, with less homocidal tendencies), or possibly a spiked chain-wielding finesse fighter... though with that last option, I'm not sure where he'd come from, why he'd specialize in such an odd weapon, etc etc. I'll go through the FR Campaign Setting book and see if any of the countries or organizations leap out at me, for him.
