Doesn't it seem like you can have more fun in one good conversation than in all the parties you go to combined?  If a large portion of inventions just end up causing more problems than they solve, shouldn't we just cut our losses and stop inventing things?  Is it OK to be intolerant of intolerant people?  Which would you prefer, everyone liking you or everyone respecting you?  Aside from obvious scientific changes, how would the world be different if there was no night?  How do we know that that we don't have impaired vision and color blind people are seeing things how they really are?  Is life so complicated just because we make it that way?   -alex
