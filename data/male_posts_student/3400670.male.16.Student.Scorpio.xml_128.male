Actually here I want to say thank you very much with my deepest appreciation for your great care and effort you put in as a teacher and administrator to support and help the Skyview students, and your efforts to make Skyview a better place.  Yeah and since this is the end of the AP test and, I have to say that this year has been a great experience in your AP US history class. I have learned and grown substantially both as an academic person and a contributing member of the Skyview community, thanks to the support of you and all of my great peers.  I know you will be leaving us next year, and I wish you the best luck as a vice principal and I'm sure all of my peers and I will miss you very much.    Yeah anyways Ms.Clark, you have been a GREAT AP US HISTORY TEACHER AND A GREAT ASB ADMINISTRATOR! I'll certainly miss you very much next year as I continue my journey through the Skyview storm.  And I'll come up and visit you sometimes.
