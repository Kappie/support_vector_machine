The resevoir is soo cool is so big and watery and still. We counted something like 17 ducks and to remote controlled airplanes! Water is so cool i sometimes wish i could be a water molecule and fly around in the sky and get drunk and stuff it would rule! Paul (my guitar teacher) didn't come for some reason, i guess i will haveto ring him in the morning. I have decided one of my lifes aims is to go to Japan at least once before I die, the gimicky, flashy tackyness of Japan just appeals to me. The people are really cool too. I wonder how many times im going to say cool today i have already said it 5 times :/ My washing machine is ignoring me today so i think i will make friends with the dryer and make it jealous, muhahahahahaha(cue evil laugh) it'll come crawling (or whirring?) back to me yet!
