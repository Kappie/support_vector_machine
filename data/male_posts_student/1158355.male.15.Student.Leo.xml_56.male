Normal come home, no track, and lay down around the room until Saturday morning. Good Bye... Wtf nobody even reads this. So I can be like I LIKE PEARS and nobody will read it! Hahaha! YOU SUCK! HAHAHAHA! Well if you are reading this, just to inform you, you're reading a geek's journal... that's right... I am a geek and I'm PROUD!
