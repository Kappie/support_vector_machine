The music, the acting, and just the general vibe was phenominal. I'll always be a fan of that show, especially with the original cast. I have mock-trial for the Crucible in my English class tommorrow during second period. Im the lead defnese attorney, so I have to come up with an opening statement before 8:25 tommorrow. I dont know how much ill write or how long ill be up blabbing but it will probley beingt something worth seeing.   Homecoming was last night and I had the best time ive ever had at a high school dance. Sara, if you have/get/read this: Thanks. You made last night awesome and put up with my textbook case of chronic white-man syndrome. Just going and hanging out with you was great, and even though Brandon was being a bit of a punk it was one of the funnest nights ive had in a long time.  I wrote a short story a while ago, something that i'm preety proud of but I havent really given it out to anyone so i think im just going to post it here.                                                      The End of Innocence, The Coming of Fire                                                                       By: ************** 	The young man is sitting in the potato fields, silently dozing, while hiding from his driving brothers task mastering. The smell of freshly tilled earth is all around and he breathes it in. His clean white shirt is covered in dirt and his pair of brown overalls is a little muddy. The trees of his father’s farm provided good shade in the summer, or in this case, during the winter they provided something to climb into and keep warm (warm being anything other than the cold ground). These trees planted in the potato fields farthest reaches are a species of evergreen nicknamed "Bed Leaf" by children and soldiers that would camp out in the trees huge leaves for a dry, warm, if not overly comfortable place to sleep. 	This particular day, this particular boy (who's name happens to be Nickoli Ronsiov) has conveniently "forgotten" his choirs and his assigned toils to go and sleep in the crisp, cold, winter air. His older brother, Vladimir, has been left to do the choirs around the farm. He doesn't complain, but you can be sure that if Nickoli shows up before eight o'clock tonight his brother’s foot will be introduced to his ass. Nickoli knows this. All sixteen-year-old boys know what’s in store for them when they get home from going off without telling anyone where they’re going. Some parents think they enjoy the feeling of a swift kick in the tail. In reality they just weigh the positives and the negatives of disappearing for the day, and miraculously the positives always outweigh the negatives. In short, they just don't give a damn. 	Nickoli looks at the night sky and wonders the things he will see in the years to come. All men in the Galactic Federation must serve a three-year military term at the age of twenty and Vladimir, or Vlad as Nickoli likes to call him, is shipping out in a little over two months. He wants to spend as much time with his brother before he leaves, but considering the fact that Vlad is, in Nickoli's opinion a "lovable, cuddly, hard ass.” he felt today would be the most optimal day to have some "me" time. Today being the last day of harvest and seeing how they had miraculously picked the potato fields the last week, Nickoli seized the opportunity. The young man sat staring at the clouds wondering about a few things. What would war be like, or for that matter love? Would he live through one to see the other? Many things are unsure in the galaxy right now and he is worried. 	None of this matters now though. His worriers melt and meld into the seamless shapes in the clouds. The leaves on the near by oak trees are blown off the ground and drift down to land on Nickoli's face. A cold wind blows down through the field and sends a shiver up Nickoli's back. He gets up and runs down from the raised hill that the tree stands on the in the southwest corner of the field. The wind at his back and the moist earth beneath his feet the young boy gallops over the field towards the swimming hole that is often left unused during the winter for the obvious reasons. As he reaches the dock he begins to shed his shirt and overalls. He steps towards the edge and jumps.  	Just before he would have hit the water a strong arm reaches out from behind him on the dock, grabs him and places him back on the dock. A shrill, whining voice erupted from the thought of Nickoli, "Vlad! Why do you always have to be such a asshole?" 	"Well, little brother, if you did you choirs and didn't leave me to do them for you then I would have to be such a asshole, as you put it. By the way I didn't do them for you this time and seeing how mad Mama and Papa get when you don't do your choirs before dinner, I suggest that you run your scrawny ass off and get home. Dinner is in half an hour." 	"But, I can never finish all my harvesting in a half hour without my arms falling off! That’s three whole fields!" 	" Then you had better run, shouldn't you?' Vladimir said as a sly smile covered his face. "And don't go naked, I’m sure the ladies in the village don't want to see the "little trooper" very much now. Considering the weather it wouldn't be too flattering for you either." 	With that, Nickoli rose to his feet, quickly got dressed, gave his brother a rather impolite gesture and started off running towards the village and the fields. All his brother did to this is smile and yell at the small figure moving off into the distance "Run little one! Run!" Nickoli never heard this but he go the idea. He was screwed. Fucked six ways from Sunday. Damn it, Vlad. I'll never finish this and if I do I’ll be so tired I won't have enough energy left in me to eat supper. As he rounded the corner in to the village square he noticed something odd about the way the people were moving. Some were huddled together, talking in hushed voices. Others were visibly scared shitless. 	"Mrs. Troski, what’s going on?" he asks the old woman in the window of the bakery, the largest store in the square. 	"Nothing, Nickoli, darling. Go Home. Hide and warn your parents to stay inside." the old woman said in a hushed, concerned voice, a voice of concern and worry. Suddenly fear overcame her face. "Run Nickoli. Run!" 	Why she wanted him to run he did not know, but he was so scared he did not question the old women. He took off down the small dirt street toward his farm so fast that he could not even hear the cries of the women yelling at him to run as he passed by the old folks home, or the swear words that came from the market place. It had become colder since he left the swimming hole, so much so that the sky began to snow. The boots he wore crushed into the fresh layer of puff that lined the street. He exited the alley onto the paved streets of the farming communities. This is where the farmers and their families lived and plowed their fields. The community field and the area for livestock were at the other side of the town. The farms are not exactly close to each other but they are close enough that one could run from one to the other in about fifteen to twenty minutes without being winded when he got there. As he rounded the corner of the street he could hear the sounds off gunshot and fighting coming fro the square. Scared for his life, he simply ran faster. Nickoli approached his house and saw his mother standing at the doorway waiting for him. The snow was really coming down now and he could see the concern on his mothers face. "Where are your brother and father? Vlad left about forty-five minutes ago to go find you. When he didn't come back your father left to get the both of you. Where were you today, my little lazy one? I noticed that your fields didn't get harvested today." 	"Sorry mama. I forgot about them. I won't do it again." Nickoli lied. "Father and Vladimir are not back yet? I haven’t seen papa since this morning but Vlad was out in the potato field wit.. Getting me. He should be back soon." 	His mother eyed him with one of those looks that can make you piss your pants. She turned away from him and walked into the house. Nickoli turned around for a moment to see if he could see his brother or father coming up the road. When all he saw was snow and pavement off into the distance he went into the house. The Ronsiov home was not spectacularly large by any means but it was large enough that the four of them could live in peace for the few years that they actually did live together. The house was heated and air conditioned but the generators that powered most of the house and the barn had really bad power converters so they broke all the time, but today the house was nice and toasty compared to the outside condition. 	Nickoli trudged up to his room, which was in the attic. His mother yelled up at him "Nickoli! Wash your hands and face and come down for dinner in about ten minutes, ok honey?" The teen aged young man brushed her off with the typical groan that is a trademark of his age. He hurried up the stairs to the second floor, which contained everyone else’s rooms and the bathrooms. He passed them by and pulled on the small cord dangling down from the ceiling. A door opened from the roof down and a small ladder came down from on top of it. He climbed up the ladder and into his room. 	  His room was a maelstrom of papers, sheets of music, dirty clothes, instruments and (somewhere in the mess) his bed and desk. He is a talented musician, not the best at his school but he tries harder than anyone else. His real passion is writing and politics. He is not a very outgoing young man, but when you have earned his good graces and his friendship he will talk your ear off about politics or his latest poem or story. Recently he has developed a passion for researching the history of the first planet in the confederacy, Earth. He enjoys reading economic theories of the great analyses of the days. Marx and Engels, the political calculations of Fronc, the economic ponderings of Chreza and last but not least the overall works of George Scott King. He loves debating with his friends why these theories of great men and great countries failed. His friends blame it on the easily acceptable viewpoint of the majority:  the socialist and Marxist theory does not work. The existence of free trade is a basic human need.  	For the most part he does not question this assumption made by his friends and peers because he knows that, for the most part he is the only one that has examined the theory. They mistakenly call the soviet countries in the 20th century truly communist in nature. None have read Marx, few have read Chreza and Fronc outside of history class, and there is only one other person that Nickoli knows that has even heard of George Scott King. That particular person is his one true intellectual equal and his main source of debate. Charles Jeos is his rival, friend and collaborator. As Nickoli walks down the stairs to greet his mother properly and eat dinner he thinks of a discussion of little importance that he and Charles had earlier in the week. 	"Momma, there was a commotion in the streets when I was walking home. Mrs. Troski told me to come home and not look back. As I rounded the corner onto our street I heard gunshots coming from the village. Do you know what’s going on?" A look of open curiosity was on the young mans face and a parallel image of dread and discomfort came over his mother. 	"So." she said as she backed up a few steps slowly and fumbled behind her for a chair. Grabing the nearest stool from table she sat down. "So, this is how the government repays us for feeding their damn soldiers!"  Tears began to well up in her eyes as she began to speak faster and louder, almost at a yell. "Bastards! Raze our lands, burn our farms, destroy our lives and kill our families, then just go off and cover it up as if nothing happened." 	"Momma? What is going on!" the distraught Nickoli pleaded with his hysterical mother. 	"The Galactic Federation Army son. They come to our planet every 20 years or so, steal the sturdy men, burn the crops and loot the buildings. The media doesn’t get involved because its controlled by the government, the other planets don’t give a damn because they are to busy staring into their own navels to give second thought to off-world problems. They let the Federation handle it, even when the federation is the damn problem! And on top of all this the supposed upper class, those fat, wine sipping bureaucrats that run the mines and factories encourage the army because after people die they tend to lose their main means of support. That means they can pay you as little as they want." She got up and, with a dazed look at her son; she walked towards the front door. Looking out the front door you could already see the flames rising from the town square. 'Papa didn’t leave to go get you and Vlad. Vlad didn’t even leave to get you to do your choirs. Your father left to fight the damned. Your brother left to find you and get you off the streets where you would have surely died." 	As the words came from his mother's mouth Nickoli couldn’t believe what she was saying. It was treason! Yet, he couldn't deny that he knew it was true. The G.F was never very kind to them and he always felt they were the secret enemy. "Momma. Listen to me. Go to the Boyurs down the road. Give me the keys to the house and the closets and go be safe. I will find papa and Vlad and well all come and see you by the morning. Ok?" 	With the dazed look deepening and here realization of what was going on outside increasing she nodded in agreement, handed him her key ring and walked outside. After he could tell she was gone, safe down the street and close to the Boyurs farm, he locked the doors and took his fathers gun from the rack that was in his parent’s room. He locked the front door and walked down the street towards the pyre that was his home and city less than two hours ago. 	This town square was designed just like most others. It may even resemble the one in your town. It had one large, open area with four roads intersecting, one from each side. There was a large statue of Cyser Gestl, founder of the Galactic Federation, planted smack dab in the middle. Unlike your community, most likely, it was in the engulfed in a civil war. Nickoli approached fro the southern corner of the market. He could see lines of federation troopers lined up like the ranks of stone that built the buildings in the city. He fired a shot from his small 22-gestyr rifle into the files of soldiers. One fell dead, right in front of the other soldiers. All they did was knock him out of the way and continue to shot at the small bands of rebels fighting to the north and the east. He continued to fire into the rows of soldiers, all the time the only person that ha notice him shooting from the other side of the center was dead. Nickoli had placed a shoot of pure energy through his temple.  	The forces on each side of the battle began to grow thin. The G.F troops had suffered far more casualties at this point than the colonists had, yet they had now just begun to even out in the number of actual men. Then a grand roar rose up from the eastern battalion. The leader rose from his makeshift trench and ordered his men to rush the general line. A sea of bodies ran towards the area that the G.F stood. Nickoli could not see who had given the order to rush the enemy line but by the time the actual rush had begun he could see the two that were out and in front in all the fighting. They were his brother and his papa.  	His father, being a rather large and well-built man, was cleaving the bodies of men in the crucible that had been created in the center of the town. The troops in the northern corner of continued to inflict casualties from their protected position. Nickoli protected his kin from the would-be "heroes" that were aiming to kill them. Then, it happened. His shoot missed his target and hit a trooper standing in front of him. The G.F warrior followed through with his step and ran the length of his bayonet into Nickoli's father's belly. The soldier, who from looking at his build could have been much older than Nickoli himself, pulled his weapon out and continued to fight.  	Hatred boiled up inside of him. His thought became dry and he couldn’t speak. He raised his gun right toward the head of the soldier that had just butchered his papa. The young recruit turned and saw Nickoli. And Nickoli saw him. For a split second they connected on some psychic level and the only words in the mind of the small farmers son was "Die mother Fucker." The connection broke and Nickoli pulled the trigger. The battle slowed to a crawl. You could see the movement of the bolt as it burned the ozone in the plaza. When the blast finally got close enough to the soldier’s head his eyes opened wide and you could see his mouth form "Fuc..”. Then his head was gone. From the base of the neck to the top of his head he there was nothing, were 5 seconds beforehand there had been a living breathing thinking being. 	As Nickoli was focusing in on his fathers killer a sniper on the other roof, a G.F. troop, had gotten him in his sight. Just as Nickoli had pulled the trigger Vladimir Ronsiov noticed the sniper and his target. With a yell of "Nickoli!" Vlad jumped into the direct line of the sniper. He let out a load howl of unbelievable pain. Imagine the loss of a leg to a thousand small knives and then imagine those knives being coated in iodine. That is a fraction of the amount of pain caused by an energy bolt. The sound of his brother’s death wail brought Nickoli back to reality. Turning and raising his position he shoot the arm of the sniper clean off. He turned and stared in a look of pure disgust at the boiling stump that used to be his arm. 	And then, it just ended. The firing stopped, the bodies fell and the men calmed themselves. All the G.F troops were dead. Nickoli walked forward to the center of the square, where a hush and silence had befallen all the men that a moment before had been bloodthirsty monsters. Nickoli was the only one that was moving. He stopped, looked at everyone in the plaza, turned and took aim. He pulled pack his trigger for the last time that day and shoot the head off of the statue of Cyser Gestl. He looked at the men again, walked to the statue and began to clime. All was silent, not a man spoke. Then as he reached the top he let out a yell of mixed victory and sorrow. "Viva la Revolution!" he cried out so that all men in the city could hear him. All the old farmers and young men, now soldiers, yelled with him. Then what had been a little boy began to cry. He sat on the top of the statue and cried into the night.
