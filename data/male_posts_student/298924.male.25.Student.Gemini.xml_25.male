There is nothing like conversation with a woman who has knowledge of self....if I some of these ladies I interact with here could gain that last bit of essential character, I might be able to do the impossible and find a wife....  Lastly....I don't know why this popped into my mind....but I am kind of saddened by the disintegration of the once mighty Wu Tang Clan....I think back to when I was a die hard fan of the Wu and really thought they were invincible....now they are nowhere to be found....OJ where have all the heroes gone?
