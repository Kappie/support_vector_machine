LOL  After that,we met SHAWN,the KING of CRITICISING.We watched Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban..   Meanwhile,in the cinema which was like a freezer,Nick sat beside a gal who looked like a duck.There were 3 girls who were around 18 yrs old and they were all very FAT.They made coments like "OFF THE DAMN TORCH LIGHT LEH!". LOL,STUPIT FAT TOADS.then shawn once in a while go n scream "ha..ha" LOL.When the show ended wich appeared to be nice to sam and boring to nick, shawn picked up sam's drinking straw,and shot it @ a mother's face.It flew like a missile before "THUD".The woman gave a stern look and muttered sum GOD KNOWS WAT SHE'S SAYING words. For our dinner,we had it @ LONG JOHN SILVER.We ordered 3 combo 1,and it tasted like shit.So,we ended up with sum left-overs - 2 pieces of chicken breasts.We took the breasts,went out to the openin outside Macdonalds @ the ground floor,aimed the breasts @ the window of Mac @ 2nd storey."PIAK!" the 1st breast hit the glas,meat was dispersed,wad a success!."TOK!" the 2nd breast mised the glas,it ended up lying on the floor on story 1 - Flattened,what a sad case it was.But after few minutes of thoughts,we picked up the meat wich was on the floor,and threw it real hard @ the signboard of LONG JOHN  MAC.WOW!I LOVE IT! Went our ways home and now im siting in front of the comp writing in thirsty HIPpO.
