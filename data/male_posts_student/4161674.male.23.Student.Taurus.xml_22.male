You know, the whole "give those couple of bucks a week to charity" and "pray for the hungry when I was craving a Coke" sort of stuff. Anyways, I was driving back from Buffalo very late on Tuesday night and picked up a Pepsi at Kwik Fill. I noticed when I got back in the car that it was 12:00 am on Ash Wednesday. That plan lasted long!
