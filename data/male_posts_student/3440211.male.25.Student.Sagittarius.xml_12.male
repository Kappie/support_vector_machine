This is a carrot soup in a few pictures:  We start by frying a choped onion in some olive oil.        Then add some dried Ham     Then the carrots... and after a bit the red pepper     Cover in water and bring to the boil...     When the carrots are soft take out of the fire and use the blender...     Thats it.....
