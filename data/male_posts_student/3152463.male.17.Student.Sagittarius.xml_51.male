I have, in fact, been to Walt Disney World in Florida, which was very enjoyable.  My favourite of the four Disney parks is EPCOT, the main feature of which is pictured below.       A very impressive site at the front of the EPCOT Center, indeed.  There is actually a ride inside it -  Spaceship Earth  - which is a history of mankind, featuring animatronics and 'time-travelling' vechicles ... Don't ask.  Another great part of EPCOT is  Test Track  : a fast-paced ride in which the riders are supposed to be crash dummies for car testing.  The tests are performed indoors, but the highlight of the trip is a 'practice run' at 80 mph around the outside of the building !  That is a truly incredible experience !  Highly recommended.         Also in EPCOT's Future World is  The Land  - an example of how to grow crops without soil etc,  Mission : SPACE  - a disappointing simulation ride of space flight,  Universe of Energy  - an animatronic show about the creation of energy,  Imagination !  - an area about 'your imagination', featuring Dr. Nigel Channing  (Eric Idle) , a strange character called 'Figment', and the cast of 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids',  Wonders of Life  - about the body,  Innoventions (East  West)  - a world of exciting interactive experiences - hosted by 'Tom Morrow 2.0' and  The Living Seas  - seemed a bit of a disappointment ... About fish.  The other half of EPCOT is called  World Showcase  - a journey around the world, featuring pavilions of Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, The USA, Japan, Morocco, France, The United Kingdom and Canada (all include people of these nations, and local food etc.)  There are of course three other parks in Walt Disney World, but EPCOT is my favourite, so I'll leave it at that.  I will however mention a extremely enjoyable ride at the Animal Kingdom, called  Primeval Whirl .  It's basically a roller coaster, but with not as many turns as the usual kind.  The difference is that the carriages spin around as they go down and over bumps.  It is a great ride, and I would recommend trying to get on it twice in one day, as it's over quite quickly.  The queues don't tend to be that long though, so it's not too long a wait.  If you're in need of music, DVDs, videos, games, books, a cinema etc. while you're staying in Disney, there's a  Virgin Megastore  at Downtown Disney, along with a cinema, a guitar shop, night clubs, restaurants etc.  Sadly, I found no trace of Tintin in Florida.
