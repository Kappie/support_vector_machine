Great, now that I’ve got that out of the way I can start spewing random babble that nobody probably gives a rat’s ass about.   Topic 1: Calculus sucks   Let me just get a few things out of the way before I start.  I’m 26 years old and still in junior college.  Since I graduated high school in ’95 I’ve been working for places like Hewlett Packard and Shin Itsu, all the while spending my money on frivolous stuff and embarking on mini adventures like living with my girly friend in Japan and the like.  I never really had an academic plan, other than to earn a “general transfer degree” to a four-year university.  But about a year ago I made the decision that it was time to roll up the ol’ sleeves and get that damn degree, and pronto.  So now I finally have my AA (i.e. 2 year) degree, but need to take a few more classes in order to transfer to WSU’s computer science program.  One of those classes is calculus.  Which brings me to my main point: calculus  sucks .  Not only is it tons of work, with daily homework and frequent quizzes, but it is just plain boring.  The sad thing is I still have Calc II and III to look forward to… ack!  Oh well, I’ll persevere and keep writing so my creative juices don’t dry up in the face of such a hideous subject.   Topic 2: My Gaming Life   Videogames are obviously a big part of my life, so I thought I’d give an update on what I’m playing/looking forward to at the moment.  Basically,  The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edtion  is my gaming priority.  Since my previous saved character was on a different Xbox I had to start all over for  GOTY , but I totally enjoyed it because I did things much differently.  I still think it is one of the best RPGs ever created – right up there with  KOTOR  and  FFII  III .  With the Super Bowl just around the corner I have found myself motivated to play some  ESPN NFL Football , which is also a great I might add.   Dynasty Warriors 4 ,  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! ,  Metroid Prime  and the ever addictive  Animal Crossing  are a just few other games that have been the subject of my attention lately.  Obviously the biggest game I’m looking forward to is  Halo 2  (thank you Bungie for bringing back the weekly update!!), but  Ninja Gaiden ,  FF: Crystal Chronicles  and  Fable  are also up there on my Most Wanted list.
