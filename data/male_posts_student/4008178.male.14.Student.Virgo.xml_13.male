"Aguante"it'slike to confront something with brave, so you can guess what does "aguante la'07" means (for the ones that couldn't guess it, it is like "you can do it generation '07"). Generation '07 claims to be a united and powerful generation in which everyone is animportant part of the generation '07 society, kind of like communism, including the dictatorship part of it since if you are not part of it they want to kick your ass up to your face as you could see with the rant Felipe did about Friday's party in Pablito's house (if you didn't then do it). Now the truth is that this unity is as true as George W. Bush being a "peace president". On our generation (or class) many people is bullied everyday (in school days), like Gay J (he deserves it since he is annoying) Patricia, Mow Mow, Tatiana, Oscar... And the list goes on and on. I personally have being bullied for abouttwo and a half years, which means I have being suspended and have had to fight some of the persons who bullied me. The curious thing about it is that some of the people who bullied me now are trying to be nice and sometimes it pisses me off, because I think I have more friends in other generations than in this generation '07, and when someone who bullied mefoundme talking to someone from other generation they start being hypocrite and start acting like they have always being my friends. Now you can like have an idea of how is our generation. These doesn't means there are good persons in the class, but unfortunately there is more bad than good in my opinion, like for every 5 persons 2 of them are cool. This ratio is not objective since it is my opinion. Now back to the main theme. If this generation is united then why the bulling? That's because it's not true. If someone deforms your face no one will care about it in fact they will just stare a you wail they do it. Our proud generation also comes with its own home page:  urlLink  www.tuleparty2nite.4t.com  . At the beginning it was owned by Tufo, Fabro, and Chris (friend of us). Then Fabro left and came in Carlos, there it start the reing of stupid polls. They first made a poll which said: Who is the most freak in our generation: in which featured Felipe, Gurdian, Tatiana, Daniela Montealegre, some other persons I don't remember and me. This poll was made by our hypocrite (according to what people have told us) friend. Then it came another poll in which it said: Did you went Patricia's party, options,I wasn't invited, No, Yes, I don't fucking care. In the comments they start to making fun out of her. Finally I post a page long comment complaining about this generation and our friend Chris delete the poll. Now the web page is mainly owned by Chris since Tufo doesn't care about it and Carlos left the web page. I think mainly that's the main stuff about the problem and with that, you reader, can see our opinion. Thanks.
