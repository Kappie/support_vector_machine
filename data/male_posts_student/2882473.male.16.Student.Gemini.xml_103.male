(Deserving at least 3 exclamation marks). Although sadly, however, it is not currently in use, as:  1) There is no MS Office on it, so nothing to write my blog in. (I write it in Word, then copy and paste to blogger, saving as I go. I have an unpleasant experience of writing straight into the blogger box. Yes, I could use notepad, but then see point 2…)  2) There is no internet on it yet, so again I would be unable to use blogger. My mum does promise however (something she rarely does, preferring to use a good ol’ ‘maybe’) to get some BT discount broadband, which she hasn’t got round to ordering yet.  So I am using the old computer, which is just about adequate for the purpose of blog writing. Anyway, more about the new one! It has 256MB RAM (still not quite sure what that does, but the higher the better I was told), a 2.7 GHz processor (some sort of speed thing, I think), and more hard drive capacity than I can ever see myself using (80GB to be precise, but as I am doing just fine using 10GB on my old computer, this should be plenty)  Anywho, the day went as follows. At 0800 I woke up from a nice long sleep, 9 hours in fact. I ate some breakfast, and then discussed the possibilities of taking a trip to PC World Croydon with my mum and sister. We also needed a new fridge, so decided that we should order it in the Argos near-by. So, at 1100 we left for Croydon, on a stifling hot day. We arrived, and decided Argos to be first as we missed the turning for PC World. Ok, we didn’t actually miss the turning, but I figured I needed a slight amount of humour in the blog. So, we went to Argos and qued… cued… waited in line for a while and then placed our order of one £220 fridge freezer, to be delivered in the next 10 days. This done, we made our way to PC World, and took a look round. Eventually we found a nice one, for only £400, without a screen (the one we were to buy). So, the sale assistant took us to sit by a computer where she tried to sell us a 3 or 5-year guarantee for £100 or £150, which my mum flat out refused. The sales assistant then ordered me (didn’t even say ‘please’ – total rudeness) to go to the front of the store and fetch a trolley, which I did without difficulty. We then waited while she took the trolley and fetched our computer. We then bought a £30 printer for my sister’s laptop, which she will need in university next year. And then we came home. Phew…  Arrived home very hungry, so I made my sister, mum and me scrambled egg, which actually turned out very nice. Also had some crisps and half a mango. Next I unpacked the new computer, connected it to the old monitor, and changed the horrible Packard-Bell wallpaper to one of the preset nicer ones. Then realising there was little to do on it without internet or Office, I turned it off, and connected the old base unit to the monitor again.  What a good day it has been.  Ta for now.   Weather:  Very hot, very sunny  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Matrix Revolutions soundtrack  Watching:  Unbreakable later tonight  Confused about:  What RAM is (tell me again please, in the comments)  Annoyed with:  Nothing! Great day!  Mood:  Very good :)
