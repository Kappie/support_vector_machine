I jus feel miserable, i dont wanna do anything anymore, i dont wanna go to school (like i do...yeah right), i dont wanna play vball, i dont even want to do anything, i jus want to jus b by myself for a while, i like helpin ppl out and stuff and i wish everyone for the best but i jus wanna find my faith and my drive again, cuz its totally lost and i cant go on wit out it. Damn...i cant believe i feel this shitty, i cant even find a way to stay positive.
