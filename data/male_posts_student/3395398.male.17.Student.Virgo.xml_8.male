You will never know. How much you change me.  You will never know. How much I am afraid of letting my heart get hurt.  You will never know. I am looking forward to see you.  You will never know. I let my heart to keep all my feelings towards you, deep and deeper into my heart.  You will never know. There are only two choices lay in front of me. To Fight or to Give up.  You will never know. The day i go for TOEFL exam, i was thinking about you all day long.  You will never know. I like you.  You will never know. Maybe one day of many years and years later, somewhere on planet earth, I will be thinking of you again, and tell myself, I once like you. You will never know, and  I like you still.
