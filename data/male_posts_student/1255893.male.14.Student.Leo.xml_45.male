I could swear they have fetishes or something. It didn't get much better because I had to go through my third day of the CAT6 test. I finished early(as always) so I fell asleep for a few minutes(try 2 hours of sleep in class). This is where it started to get good. It turns out the teacher, as well as everyone else, thought I was dead. They kept poking me and screaming at me, but I just wouldn't get up. I scared them alll when I woke up. Afterward I played some basketball and won. This shoked me so much because I am incredibly bad at the game. It got even better when I went to eat at Carl's Jr. I don't know why, but it just felt really good to sit down and eat there. The day is now ending. I'm watching the original X-Men movie. So I guess that's pretty good. I think I'll go to sleep now. L8R!
