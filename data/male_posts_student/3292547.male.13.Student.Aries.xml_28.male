We were halfway back to the car when my mom called and said that she had told Allyson (my sister) to meet us at the end of the parade route. (She was in it too for being in Junior Miss- I'll tell you more about that when it happens) So we had to wal all the way back to the end.  Right before we left I was thinking about telling ya'll I was leaving (Boy can you tell I'm hick =P), but changed my mind. I did, however, find out that we had a site on it. If you're interested, and don't happen to be one of my friend's that lives here, Here's the  urlLink link .  That's the Tennessee Strawberry Festival for those who are wondering. I know that when I was searching on  urlLink MSN Search  for  urlLink "Strawberry Festival"  it turned up a bit. So did the  urlLink results  from  urlLink Google .
