Atif, Dan, Josh, and Monica came to do service too (they have the same project.) We played volleyball most of the time, and then went inside. Me, Atif, and Monica chatted while Josh and Dan played some ATV game on the PS2. I still think the project is a waste of time, but its beats the alternate assignment (reading Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy...about 720 pages long.) And it all ended with me getting Whataburger, which I never get tired of. The chicken tenders don't taste fake and spongy, the fries are topped only by McDonald's, and the drinks are  ginormous . Yeah, it's kinda expensive, and you always end up waiting like 10 minutes, but it's all worth it. And that's about it kids, be sure to show this one to your math teacher:
