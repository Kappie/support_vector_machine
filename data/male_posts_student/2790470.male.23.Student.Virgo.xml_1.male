He said, I am going to give this $20 to one of you  but first, let me do this. He crumpled up the $20 dollar bill and then asked, Who still wants it? Still the hands were up in the  air.      He replied, What if I do this?   And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind  it into the floor With his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty.  Now, who still wants it? Still the hands went into  the air.     My friends, we have all learned a very valuable  lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it  because it did not decrease in value. It was still  worth $20.      Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We may feel as though we are worthless, but no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.      Dirty or clean, crumpled or creased, you are still priceless to  those who love you.      The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by who we are.      We are all special - don't ever forget it.      And remember: amateurs built the ark ...professionals  built the Titanic.      If God brings you to it - He will bring you through it.
