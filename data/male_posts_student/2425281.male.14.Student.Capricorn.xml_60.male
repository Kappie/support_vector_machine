LoLz. i'd just like to mention that in some cases, you make a mistake and it turns your life upside-down and there's no turning back. that is all. on a more  normal  note. subject selections handed in. had to get to school at 8 this morning for macquarie cup meeting. turns out that we are going to the same place on friday as we did last week for jap. meeting was interesting, podmore can actually express herself to a point where she is easily understood unlike that guy who was supposedly coaching us for hill debating. it sucks how podmore changed the debating teams though - now jack, bibhu and weller are split up. jack isn't in a team anymore and has to chair, bibhu is with edward davison and michael koziol and weller is with year 9's! (i think it may have changed during the day) first period was * no talking * maths. i'm actually doing work in maths now thnx to someone ^___^ but seriously, indices is getting annoying. when are we doing logs?! hmm...latin was the usual boring unknown stuff. the latin vocab we learnt today was a tinsey bit sexually inclined (>. jason's mobile .  badminton was good - sort of. didn't play kiong of the hill but me and york beat jeff and miyoko (that's how you spell it right?) miyoko's actually really scary when she smashes the shuttlecock down, lolz. spent the rest of the time listening the ian's mp3. i don't think i'm going back there anymore,  try-outs for vball  should start next week. farewell willoughby leisure centre and buses with really weird willoughby girls high ppl. *shiver* at least they weren't on the bus today. but a random sat next to me and kept asking me where chatswood was. -.-;; we were practically there. oh, and i saw ian and his mum walking to get his L's.  go ian ! hehe...he can drive now. i have a feeling it won't be the sports car - knowing azn/honky mothers. lolz. i have no idea how i went on for so long but i shall conclude here by saying that i missed out on the chem olypiad registration date because i was at japanese excursion which means i won't do the exam. w00t! =)
