Probably the coolest thing that I got was a  urlLink Canon AE-1 Program  camera system with two zoom lenses. I should really have fun learning how to use it. I've crossed out everything that I got from my  urlLink Christmas wishlist  below, but I got many things that were not on there. Again, I want to thank my family for a great day together. Special thanks to my mom for all of the awesome food. Mmm...turkey...
