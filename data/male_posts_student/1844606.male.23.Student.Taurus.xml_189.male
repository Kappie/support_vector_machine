I was less than 5 feet from Patton playing insane conductor and Dave Lombardo playing the trash can and the cymbals with a violin bow.  Best performance I've ever seen.  Now all other music sounds boring.   Cubs offense needs to be consistant to win.  G. Maddox needs some control.   I have 19 pages of rough draft ready to rock for the thesis.  I might actually enjoy the Cubs game Fri.
