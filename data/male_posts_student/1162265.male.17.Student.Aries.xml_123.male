I don't plan on finishing it all before I go to Virginia beach next week, but I at least want to have all the damn essays done.  I'm the master of CP time....  Whatever though.  Stuff'll get done.    Also, has anyone else started to feel old yet?  I can already feel the slight pressure from the years pilling up, and I'm what? Sixteen?
