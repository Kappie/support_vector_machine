As soon as I woke up, I logged onto Uproar and started playing Acrophobia. And from there, I've been hopping to other games on other sites. Hearts, Family Feud, Strike a Match, Password. I can't help it man, this shit is fun! If you've ever played Acrophobia, you know that it possesses addictive qualities similar to heroin. They give you a series of letters, you make an acronym out of them, everybody votes on which one is the best, and the one with the most is the winner of the round. And when you start, there's no stopping, at least for the next few hours. If you would like to play,   urlLink here's the link . As you've no doubt guessed by now, my life is not very interesting.
