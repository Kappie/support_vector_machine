I went to Borders, Walden Books and another rink-a-dink book store in search of this book that I really have no intrest in reading. *shrug*, So is life. O well. Maybe after I pay back the 2700$ or so its going to cost to fix my car I'll be able to get around to reading Clinton's memoirs. Hopefully thatll be sooner then later.
