It feels so great to feel the freedom! I've been sleeping so well lately, cuz of the lack of worries and stress. It's truly hard to avoid stress when you're in school because if u dunt worry about your work then you dunt care about it and you're just setting yourself up for bad grades and lotsa trouble! Man, my iPaq has been amazing lately! No trouble or conflicts and it just feels so satisfying to set schedules and to actually follow through with them. The thumb typing(thumbing) has also been great. Luckily I don't have huge fat fingers or else I'd be pressing 4 letters at once and just confusing everyone!   With life being so nice and relaxed, I've sought after a Summer job but to no avail as yet. I'm trying to get a job in the golf industry,but it has truly proven to be quite difficult! Not even at the miniputt place! Jeez! Well I better take up less of your time... thanks for reading though!
