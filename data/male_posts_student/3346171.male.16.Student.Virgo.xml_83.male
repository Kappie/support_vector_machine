And after the test some friends (  adam, natália and isabela ) were waiting me at the amusement par... we spent.. humm... 30 minutes standing.. and Adam got an idea " why don't we check if there's someone we know standing in the line?" .. the line was giiiiiiiant. But we didn't find anyone.. Natalia decided to get in the head of the line - thank God she did that-;    The park was cool.... but last year it was better.    We got in one machine, named "Ranger"..    Wow! It was like a swinging chair, but of course that wasn't a chair.. it was like a jail ( or we would fall and die) with a chair to sit and a bar to hold us... that thing started spinning, and spining and over and over.. and it turned everybody up side down!!!!! Wow..... it spined for 3 times, in the 4 time.. we stayed for about 6 seconds with out feet up and head down... AWESOME!!!     And after Ranger we went to the "Pirate Ship"... that was relaxxing..   i   felt my stomach on my mouth and my balls on my liver.. but that was relaxxing!    After that, Natália felt sick and we understood... we couldn't let her feeling hungry and cold.. she was pale and.. ok.. let's go to the mall!    Adam had to liave because his mom and dad wanted to go to grandpha's place... I think he didn't had to go.. but it's ok. Me and isa had a hot dog , and natália said she would eat at home!!!!        The day rocked!!!
