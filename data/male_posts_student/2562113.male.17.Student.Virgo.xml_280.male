For us we leave north rockland to go to college but we gain freedom and do what we want. Darin will be leaving North Rockland for merchant marine, where free time will be limited and when it is granted he'll probably still not be able to do anything he wants. We must make sure he spends all of his time left with a smile on his face.  I think we definately need to get some sort of beach house vaca. thing going, and also Darin, goodluck, because u MUST break that curse before you go....  Let us all make things [SMUT]ty for mister Rupinski in every way possible
