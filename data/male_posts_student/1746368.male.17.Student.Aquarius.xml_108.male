I will do it before I go to bed. I am thinking about plugging my computer back in tonight, just before I go to bed, and then not using it tomorrow (since I will be gone anyways) and then see if I even remember it on Tuesday. Eh, by writing it down here, I probably will remember it. Oh well.   Today I pretty much did a lot of nothing. I went over to my neighbors. They just got Finding Nemo, so I was watching that (yea, I had seen it before with Dominique, but it's still good). I don't feel like having a "Topic o' the day" today. The first one didn't work out, and as far as I know nobody has still commented on the second one. I don't really see the point. Come to the new group blog  urlLink Four cool guys . Lookin' at a thing in a bag.
