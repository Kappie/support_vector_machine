We all know your dad. but in your post, how do you solve a problem like maria, You just went on about things that had no relevance to anything. we dont know amanda, drew, jane, katherine, and some other people we dont know. Well, we might know katherine, but thats beside the point!  I don't mind you talking about speech meets, or spell bowl, or whatever, but when the whole thing is described in great detail, It gets rather boring, especially when you talk and complain about people who, to the perception of the majority of the blog, don't exist!  Why don't you post your dream here? If it was interesting....   Thomas: Its not censorship.  Its editing. No seriously though, I'm not deleting anything he writes, I'm just complaining about the boring stuff he writes about people unknown.  There is a difference. Some on, read some of those old posts, do you want more like that? The time one, that was interesting.  Sophia: thanks for the support  Jonah:  sorry about claire, I think.   A response to the second attack right now would make the post too long
