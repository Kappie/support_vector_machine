The jobs ferrets have had in human service have been pest control, rabbit hunting, pets and laying cables in tubes for example when building aircraft and ships or TV cables under a cathedral floor. There are also indications that they would be very proficient at finding socks.   Ferrets can become up to about 10 years old and place great demands on you in some respects, so you don't get one without being well prepared!   In case you do decide to add one to your family, be aware that you can only do it if you're able to do it if you can make long range plans, that you must be the right kind of persons to enjoy living with ferrets and vice versa and furthermore that it is always a matter which concerns the whole family.   information gathered from http://www.canit.se/~griffon/ferrets/#info
