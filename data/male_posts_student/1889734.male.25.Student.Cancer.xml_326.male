The systems appear to be healthy, and the rover is sending troubleshooting tones back to earth, so it seems to be physically in good shape.  They are focusing on memory corruption, which would be understandable considering the craft spent eight months in space being exposed to radiation.  It's designed for that, but memory is easily corruptable.  So it might just be a matter of uploading the software and rebooting the system.  That will take some time, but as long as they have power is should be doable.  These things are designed to be robust, so the recovery process is not as touchy as it might sound if you're used to your own Windows .dll problems.    I'm feeling better about it!  Don't forget the second rover lands late Saturday night.
