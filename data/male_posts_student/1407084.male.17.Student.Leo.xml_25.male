I know I should, being the section leader and all, but I tire of band. Jarvis is such a blockhead.. there's no real explanation that can describe how he is. He wants our band to be like the marching bands from Pipestone, and all those incredible shows.. those people dedicate their whole life to band it seems. Jarvis wants us to be able to compete with them someday, but he just doesnt' realize the John Marshall Band doesn't have the potential to do that.. not without having all members not participate in any fall activities other than marching band, anyways. Not gonn happen. Our field show sucks. Die. Let's have another Trombone Barbeque... this time.. let's bring a spatula.
