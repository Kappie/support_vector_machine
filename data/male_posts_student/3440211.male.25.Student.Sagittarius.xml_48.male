There is just atone of minute details to look at moving out puting my stuff on storage sharpening my CV looking for another job or academic position... what can I say life carries on and the enrgy is required. My girlfriend is really standing by me and I am very gratefull for her support. However I am leaving Brimingham on the 29th for a month and that will not be easy. A month is a long time and a lot of  things can change in my life... yet I am sure of one thing... I like her and I would like her to stay in my life. It does not appear to be simple yet I am sure something good will happen. My resignation will be the best thing that happened in my life... it may not appear so but I am more and more certain of it.  Mood: Up beat and lookingto the future with tranquile eyes like looking at the mediterranean sea...
