Is not an easy mood. Some of us ( my classmates I mean ) have been there at school just because we have to show support and be sympathetic, but enough is enough!  In them lays the truth, they are the ones that never showed up to class, they did not present their essays on time, they failed the test, at the end they did not deliver. An example:  On may 24 we were told we had an exam ( by our teacher ) on may 27. Months earlier, we ( my team and I ) knew we had a presentation the same day on another subject. We talked with the first teacher and explained that if the exam was so everyone had another chance to pass, we had already a passing grade so another exam would lower our grade. He agreed with us and decided no to press the exam on us three ( my team ). So, we had our presentation and everything was ok. Sure enough, that same night the first teacher told us some classmates had got angry and decided that if WE were not doing the test, THEY should not do it either or else WE ALL should do it. At the end we HAD to do it. That same night, we had to study and present the exam next day in the afternoon.  Now is ok to defend your position. I'm OK with it, but only if there some basis to it. That people that got all mighty and righteous were flunking. My team and I were with more than passing grades, we were above the rest, we had 10's ( A+'s ). Surely at the end, most of them had to take a fourth test to pass and WE ( MT )were the only ones that had 10 again.  It's the same this time... I'm there just to support, but at the end the ones that flunk are the ones making all the noise.. all the crying...
