Our landline is (6354)4753054. I doubt you'll be able to reach me there, though. I'm either asleep, out, or doing something else, especially with school starting next week. *sigh* I don't wanna go to school yet! If you forget, search for Midnight Delusions in yahoo and you'll get to my site wherein you can find my profile with my number. Yes, it's stupid to do such a thing as post my number in my website as well as my address but I'm not rich and famous yet so I'm sure nothing bad will happen. At least I hope so. Hope springs eternal, right?  Pablo is busy with getting a new computer, printer/scanner/copier/whatever and his own laptop. Busy busy busy that guy is. I'm in complete envy about the laptop but heck, he'll probably get it infected within a week. Heh heh! Bad me.
