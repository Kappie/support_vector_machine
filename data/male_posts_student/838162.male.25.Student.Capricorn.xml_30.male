I'm not a big fan of these online personality test, but with the current hype of this long standing series and the strength of the characters in the original book. I figured that this one would be suitable to showcase.  You can find it here:  urlLink Lord of the Rings Personality Test   Here is my result:    You are most like  Frodo Baggins, Son of Drogo  With many acquaitenances, Frodo is deeply attached to a few people, like Bilbo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam. His high ethics come out in his treatment of Gollum and Saruman. Frodo has pity on Gollum and believes that change can occur. You have a strong personal morality. You are committed to relationships and their growth. You tend to be an idealist, believing the best of the world around you. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. While providing compassion and being considerate, you may have the tendency of being soft-hearted or even "too emotional" You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits.   The Orcs display the evil side of this personality with their lengthy torture methods.  Traits: Empathic, benevolent, looking to the future. On the dark side you could be sadistic.    Happy Holidays once again, may you find cheer and joy in everything and everyone around you. God Bless.  >
