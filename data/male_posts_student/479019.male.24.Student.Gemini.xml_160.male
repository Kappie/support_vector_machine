       
      I have no idea why I'm still up. I tried to go to bed, but I couldn't. You would think that with only 3 hours of sleep last night, that I would just collapse tonight. I guess I have a lot on my mind. It's more contemplative than anything though... stuff like reflecting on my life. Truthfully... when I look back at events from the past month or two... or maybe even back to a year... it feels like part of my life is coming full circle and that chapter is closing. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just something that really makes me think. Although it's interesting stuff that I'm thinking about, sleep would be nice.  ***
