But as you can see I have changed the template for my blog and added some links.  nothing major I know but I feel good for it.  the links take you too.. 1. The BBC news website 2. Albino Black Sheep - a website devoted to all those that have to much time on their hands.  I recommend watching the re-enacted by bunnies series. 3. Red vs Blue - an animation made using Halo.  Very funny. 4. The Quicktime Trailer site.  May put some more links up to deserving sites later...
