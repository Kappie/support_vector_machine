(dc was fucking hottttt! humidity at 100% means your clothes STICk) to you  yes. that would be the one serious (!!!) drawback of the east coast. massive humidity and massive heat combine for - biblical conditions where you wander suffering delusions and mirage from lack of decent tasting water and shade. dc itself is very nice and clean. nothing compared to the hideousness that is san fransisco where the crack zombies and needles can be found side by side in front of any buidling. in dc, i think they  shoot  their homeless people if they get too close to the nice buildings. oh sure, there are crack zombies in dc, butthey are all in one little zone far removed from where tourists are. sirens blare all day and night, and secret service mobiles drive by interections without stopping (or looking out for pedestrians) escorting black tinted blue limosoines (?) full of peoplewho seem important.   as for me. i kicked it in the (oh yeah! jay-z eat your heart out)  executive premier  level of the capitol hilton. sippin' on french bubbly sparkled water that ive never heard of but looks cool and spending hours a day in the jacuzzi tub with more bottled water with sharpie written "cristale" tagged on the side. oh yes, even though i dont quite look the part, it was fun having the bellhops and other people bend to your desiresbecause... youre a customer with money! suckaz. as Evasion says, "i was  living  a gansta rap song!" well, that and having to walk milesupon miles a day in the heat, but you know... the hotel was worth it in the end.  the rest of dc was nice. all the momuments and buildings,and i must say,i am glad that i went. went through the white house which was ill, and the capitol, and talked to what?! random congressmen!? how did this happen?! yeah, had to meet some of those too, whom my uncle apparenetly has some mad connex with, and as a consquence, was able to hook me up with all access passes (not really, because they dont exist) to meet the president!~ ha. now im lying. but running up a 578$ bill at a 4.5 star restaurant certainly isnt... and having a congressman pay for it all... hey, i guess that power really does have some cool points. that guy was really cool. my guess is that he wrote it off of his own taxes or something so he didnt pay for it either, which leads me to believe that... the taxpayers did!!! now i  am  important. i used taxpayer dollars to order a 25$ dessert that i got to set on fire! how cool is that?! ah yes. i love dc. but most of all, i love its people... i think we all know why. and when the dust settled and it was all said and done, my overarching lesson for the trip was: become a congressman!  god bless the u.s.a.
