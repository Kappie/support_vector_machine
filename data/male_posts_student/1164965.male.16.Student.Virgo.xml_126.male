Having read both Gatsby and Catcher, I find it kind of fun to play along as you get to know Holden and slowly resent 20's life.  Right now I'm reading As I Lay Dying, and it's like nothing I've ever read before.  The style is insanely unique (albeit a little difficult to get used to) as Faulkner switches narrators from one miserable member of the Bundren family to another with each passing chapter.  Faulkner gives real personality to the characters not by description, per se, but by narrating  as they think.  For instance, Vardaman is the youngest of the characters,  and his narration is distinct for his simple vocab and run on sentences that accurately depict the excitement of a child.  Darl on the other hand is viewed as a deep thinker so his vocab is more expansive and Faulkner really tries to play around with language and philosophy under the pretense of death.  While I rejoice that my classmates enjoy their respective novels, I'm slightly disappointed I have but one compatriot that can share the sentiments of my novel.  If you have some free time this summer, AILD will keep your mind engaged.  Keep up the great work as the instinctual countdown in your brains approaches june 23!  Love Rob
