It's the last day of college and I've just had the most nightmarishly horrible key skills presentation (God knows how you can call it a presentation when Steve is interrupting you on a second-ly basis) but I managed to come out in one piece so now I'm happy and looking forward to Thomas, summer and a bit less one way criticism from Dad about work. Oh, but alas, that can't be since Mother decided to do a "Rachael" (and no I don't mean turn into a closet lesbian) and cry over the littlest thing, which obviously, as everyone knows,  WILL  be my fault, even if it was because she can't handle menopause, like an achoholic lightweight can't handle 10 pints in a minute.  I presume that this will be my last ever blog from the LRC, which is sad considering I actually like the solitude in here, if not the slowness of the broadband.  Eraser  is gently screaming through my ear lobes, so I guess It's of to read what Giles Smith has to say in  The Times , or was it the guy with the beard? I'm not sure; anyway, many things to discuss tonight once my brain is in a farther wider frame of contemplation xBuBzx
