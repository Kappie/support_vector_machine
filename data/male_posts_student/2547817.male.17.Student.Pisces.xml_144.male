There is a wet breeze sprinkling on my face and I'm leaning on something closing my eyes. It isn't dark out, but there are raindrops on the window and I'm thankful for that. Right now; I am at peace. I want this to last for the next two hours.  It's funny how we sometimes get what we wish for, but in a slightly different way. I'm lucky today I suppose. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me down to lie in pastures green, the quiet waters by.  Yesterday was funny. Spent the whole day at the youth park. Was supposed to be henna drawing and body painting, but that didn't work out coz I can't draw a proper circle. I did publicity work and read Journey's end instead. Met Anand, the UWC boss man, and I was happy to see him. He's sincere I should think. I saw Leon Toh yesterday and that made me happy too. I miss him and it's sad. This whole happy sad thing is bitter sweet in reverse. Khin came by and I was real happy to see her too. She looks great as ever. Truly someone to be happy for. Leon and her were walking and I was happy to see them happy. I watch couples walk by sometimes and I think about Zel and it makes me sad but yesterday was different. I guess it's coz I love them. Was happy for Laura and Chris too. Met up with Shyama and Fauzi too. They're not going out, but they should. I admire their platonic ways.  Did crazy things yesterday. Suddenly stopped and screamed in the middle of a walkway at orchard. Crawling under imaginary barriers in public. I used to do that with Jolyn. I'm not sure what things are between us now. Mixed signals. Maybe I'm making it out to be more than it really is coz my mind's always in hyperdrive. Makes me a bit of a paranoid android.  We walked alone to the MRT station and she said goodbye as she boarded the train. I tried to look at her but I couldn't really. It's like the movies. I think I smiled and nodded at her, but I can't be sure. I was around Dawn the whole of yesterday but we didn't even say hi. It's awkward huh. I suppose I should be thankful though, coz I've only got 3 people that I'm sad about.  Sitting by the window is a bad thing sometimes coz I begin to think about Zel. Then again, is it really a bad thing? All I've got left of yesterday is a peeling, black, white and grey "thinker?" on my right fore-arm. It'll be like this for the rest of my life.
