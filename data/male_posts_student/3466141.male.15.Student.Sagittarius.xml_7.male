Eat, taste my flesh, Chew my brain, don't stop feeding, That sound is my soul, gently weeping, Close, shut my ears, Deaf to screams, I'm not hearing, Thats still just my soul, gently weeping.  Fly, turn away, You won't care, I'm still leaving. Thats just my anger, slowly seething. Run, get away, I have gone, you stopped breathing, These are my words that you're reading.  And you and I, We don't know why, It has to die,  We have to try.   So, havn't said anything for a while, life had a bit of an uppy downy type thing going for a few days back there, but I'm back on a constant level of bleh. The best of my few friends said that she liked my singing, I thought she was talking to someone else at the time. Im going to have to put a stop to that, probably over lots of cups of coffee that I have to learn to like, stupid caffine junkie canadians.
