I know that he said that he was fine but right now he is Lebanon, and that kinda scares me what with it being in the Middle East and all. Maybe I'm just a worry-wart but I don't know. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to him. The loss would be too great.  (Just look at the third scrolling quote, and you'll know why it'd be too great of a loss.)
