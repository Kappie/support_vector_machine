Plus a few other things that made the past few days below average: 1. I got a 26/40 on a math test (that's a D), which I had never done before. It dropped my grade quite a bit, and I don't know if we're even having a damned final. 2. My parents got pissed at me last night for not practicing instruments for a few days. grrrr...and then I have a piano lesson tonight. I always seem to manage to pull off accomplishing a ton with only a few practices. 3. I didn't do my english homework last night, so I spent today's class time reading. 4. I have a piano lesson tonight, which I'm not really looking forward to.  Plus, this Friday's concert is the final concert for The RANDOM. Tommorow is our last practice of the year too. *tear* yeah...kinda sad. I already did paint a piece of posterboard for the bass drum at the MOA concert, and Craig's working on the letter design. Should be kinda 60's-70's looking.  eh, its either walk the dogs, or clean up the dog shit, so I'm gonna go walk the dogs.  And by the way, Iowa sucks. Its just a piece of crappy flat land with stupid people that came up with the Iowa tests.
