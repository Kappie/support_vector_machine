Especially for me, every morning that I oversleep I have to deal with task of eye-crust extraction which takes a bit of time, taking longer if I am doing other things like posting in a blog. You have to switch from doing whatever you are doing to rubbing your eye a bit, each time scrapping a small amount off, still leaving a sizeable annoying amount. But after awhile it becomes second nature, switching from task to extraction as a weaver weaves in and out with needle, thread, and piece. When finally reaching your goal of an irritatant free eye you can go back to your work with a bit more efficienecy feeling accomplished and relieved.   I can't find a reason to eye-crust either, only that it is one of those inconsiderate things that just get in the way and make your life harder for no particular reason.
