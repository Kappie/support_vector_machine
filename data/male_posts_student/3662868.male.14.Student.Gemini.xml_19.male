Any other time I pwn his ass so bad there's a trail of blood that follows grimes around for days. That's why his mom was cleaning his basement. CUZ OF ALL THE ASS BLOOD! HAHA! Anyways, it's almost impossible to get good kills in a laggy game. It's not worth even trying. He knows good and well that I can take his ass in RS3 any day...
