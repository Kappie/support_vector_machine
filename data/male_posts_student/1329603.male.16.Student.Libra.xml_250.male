Apart from suicide. That's not an option, too many people rely on me at the moment.  The band practice went pretty well. We started a kinda new song. The lyrics were like this; "Only you can help me find my home, Only you can make a path through my dreams. Only you can change the world in motion, Only you can stop the flowing of streams." And I got hit for wanting to call it "Only You". What the hell...  I love Deep Purple now. They're my favourite band all of a sudden. So, yeah. Love, love, love etc.  NJaN have now got about 3 songs that are completed/near completion through jamming, and 4 in total. Which rocks. Well, only 2 rock - "Hopeless" and "What is Love?". "Only You" *punches the rest of the band* and t'other mad acoustic one are nice and sweet. Aw. I need to sort out the lyrics to the other 2. The rocky ones have already got lyrics. "You Say You Love Me" is coming on well too but I'm not sure how well it'll translate to being played live. With any luck, brilliantly. But we all know these things very rarely go according to plan. Heh, I'm the lyricist! I never thought of that before. Wow. I rule... well, I don't, but I'm quite pleased to have that revelation. Forgive me for buzzing about NJaN but I'm pleased that all of a sudden we're getting somewhere. I thought we were going to have to call it a day a while ago, we seemed to be grinding to a halt. Actually, 'A Day' might be a better name.  I look quite a lot like a woman. Who looks like a duck. So kinda a female duck. The female thing is v.v. useful for goth stuff. The duck thing is v.v. useful for working on a farm as a spy...  Quote of the day: "Believing in you seems like a whole new religion, Which is why I have to make a decision. Do I believe in our love at first sight, Or is it time for me to stand up and fight You?"  From Not Just a Number's   What is Love?   Love, Jon Roskilly
