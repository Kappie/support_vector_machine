I was really looking forward to going to PCW. Now, thanks to her, I'm not going.   Julie, Rachel, Pickle, and Mabel are all going to Anime North.   I'll be stuck at home ruining my eyes in front of my computer, tv, games, etc... Instead of being outside in the "killer rain" *rolls eyes*   Don't mind me. I'm just being me in my ticked off mode. I don't understand it. No matter how I look at it, I really don't see why rain should be the reason that I can't go. Rain can't hurt me, kill me, or do anything to me! It's like if you pour water on me. *mock horror* Oh no! I'm WET! Now what?! *mock horror ends* See what I mean? Geez, I get really dryly sarcastic when I'm pissed. (wait, who isn't?)   You know what's worse? I'm "not allowed on the computer for the duration of June and I can't go out either... to anywhere." Great! I can't go outside and have some fresh air and enjoy the great weather and I can't ruin my eyes on the computer either! Does she expect me to wake up everyday and play on the guitar and watch TV?! If I watch TV, she'll say I'm lazy. If I play on the guitar, she'll say I'm being too loud and that she's trying to sleep. If I go online, she'll say I'm supposed to be grounded. If I clean up my desk, then I'll be done within 5 minutes and have nothing to do. If I clean up the house, she'll tell me to not to because I'll make things worse. If I go bug my sister (for entertainment) she'll say I'm misbehaving. If I talk on the phone she'll say I talk on the phone too much. She's ruining my fuckin social life. I don't think she realizes that. This would be the perfect time to run away from home, you know that? But I can't miss my Sudbury trip so I'll wait until after that.   You don't see anybody else's moms fussing over the "rain" hurting them at PCW! But nooo! MY mom has to fuss over it! If my friends aren't gonna get hurt from the rain, I'm not either, "MOM"! Geez...  I know that when my sister gets up to eat, she'll ask me why I'm not at PCW and I'll point outside and say "*in mock voice* It's raining. *rolls eyes* I'm gonna get sick from the rain." and my sister will say "But it's not raining! (my guess is that the rain will hold off until tomorrow)" and I'll say "No! Can't you see?! It's raining sooo hard! (notice the sarcasm dripping off every word)" and that'll piss my mom off so badly. Do you know what'll happen after she gets pissed? She'll yell at me and ground me from anything she can ground me from. Probably make me stay in my room all day except for meals. Oh joy. It's not like I can do anything in this house anyway. I can't go anywhere. I'd go to Moca's but she's working on her costume. Otherwise, I'd be more than happy to do band practise at her place.  If it doesn't rain at 12pm, I'm gonna try making my mom drive me to PCW and call Kryss to tell me where they're at so I can catch up. I'd do ANYTHING to get outta this hell. Boring me to death.   Wasting so many seconds of my life. Life is SHORT, you gotta enjoy every single moment of it with every opportunity you get! Now is one of those opportunities. Wtf...  Fuck this I hate her.  My sister just came into my room. She asked why I wasn't at PCW. I told her it was "raining". She didn't see any rain either. It's semi-sunny outside... just a few clouds. Geez... I hate this. For once, she's on my side.
