Microsoft has 56,000 employees, but its research group, with 700, is separate. Google has 1,900 employees, and no separate research group, so all 1,900, effectively, are charged to "boldly go where no one has gone before" (its words).    They also get 20% of their work time for working on projects of their own, which is why they innovate so much.
