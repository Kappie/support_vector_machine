FUCK off man, perhap that hacker should look at himself and reflect, cos i bet he aint any balls. damn. dont let me find out who he is. tim...stay cool....and take care.... oh ya. i really hope desmond and jonchua can go for the YEP. their absence would really mean alot to me cos i know the trip will be damn different without them. but jon chua said something which is true. he would not want to go for the appeal and look at those interviewers again. seriously if for me, i would not want to go thru that again. i think damon feels the same too.  hey man. i think the dragon-boating team ROCKS!
