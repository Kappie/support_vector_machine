Althought i am at my dads right now which rules, because it is usually super fun.  Today i did like nothing, the day went by extremely fast.  I have exams on monday, tuesday, and friday, then i am done school...for 2 months or however long it is.  In britannia today i did not do much, pretty boring day, one of my plants bloomed which is pretty awesome, and i am nearly done selling tons of stuff i stole.  I am going to sell other expensive stuff later and then just steal it back haha.  I found a cell phone on the ground today and charged tons of ringtones to it, hahah sucker!  I am going to break the cell phone later.  I am going to miss that one girl that I like it kind've sucks.  I cant even believe i am making the slightest deal about it, i have talked to her like 2 times, and said like 5 words because i am a big wuss.  I usually talk to her on msn but i think she blocked me or got a new account....oh well.  This weekend I am probably going to goto the beach it will be pretty awesome, I will see all the babes and still get a tan haha. My pe teacher is so dumb, mrs kilby is her name.  I will never forget her because i hate her so much, i cannot walk in pe without announcing that i hate her so much.  I hope that she gets shot and i never have to speak to her again, she wants to fail me in pe, what a fucking bitch.  At least i have c-  so she cant really do that.  I am going to bed now and i hope i have some form of happiness in my dream today, if i even have one.  I havent been getting much sleep lately anyways, it really sucks, i look like shit. One thing i realized today is how awesome technology is.  I mean i am not talking about little shitty cells that take pics.  I am talking about pocket organizers, that can be recorders, mp3 players, organizers, movie players, internet browsers, and cameras.  I mean its fucking awesome.  They are working on technology to work computers with your mind, just started.  in 3 years they will have tvs you can sew on your shirt i will love it haha, practically play videogames on my shirt in class haha.  Well i cant wait for spring break, im out cya  Chris listening to: nothing thinking: Whether or not i will get A in math feeling:  too many feelings to explain
