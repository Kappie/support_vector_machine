I think I want to have the halloween party this year... if my parents say blah... blah blah blah  What also pisses me off, other than the fact that he lied, is that he capitalized the word 'anything' like he was trying to make it strong. So he didn't had ANYTHING to talk about? BS, he had a Halloween party to talk about. Today's title comes from 'Blink182 - Rollercoaster' My favorite song :). So, I'm talking to Bri right now. Go me! It's weird because we never knew how much we had in common. We can relate to each other a lot which is always good. I hope we have a lot of classes together :. If she would drop that waste-of-a-class "women's history" we might. I could get through that class in half a quarter. just kidding Bri ;\.  Hmm, so far today, I did the first two journals for The Odyssey, and hmm, played RCT2. Check out meh park:   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     The second one is a picture of club beach, and that's meh favorite mart of the park :). See the boardwalk?  Anyways, Bobby put me in the mood to throw a Halloween party. I'll look into it. In fact, if you live in IL, and you would come, leave a comment. I might be able to pull it off. Candy, music, pool, big screen TV w/ movies. Hey! The more I think about it the better it sounds.  Also on the horizon is the fall play, which I'm trying out for :D!  We tried so hard to say goodbye...
