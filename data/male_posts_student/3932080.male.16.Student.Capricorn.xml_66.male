Answering a recent question,  Hilton's  post-bruise comment was simply that she is "so happy to  be single right now," obviously incriminating  Carter  without direct accusation. Harshly refuting all attempts at blame,  Carter  has done little but deny. "I'll tell you one thing: I didn't touch her. I'm not that kind of guy. I would never [hit  Paris ]." He continued: "But as for the gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and herpes, I'm your man!"
