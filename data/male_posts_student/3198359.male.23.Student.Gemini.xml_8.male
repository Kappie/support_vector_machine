Well, to make it interesting, lets break down the article; that always brings a bit of lively entertainment ;-)  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A32934-2004Apr21?language=printer (Free registration required (no, as long as you don't select any subscriptions, you won't be spammed))   Family Values - Randall Terry Fights Gay Unions. His Son No Longer Will.   By Michael Powell, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, April 22, 2004; Page C01   His father, Randall Terry, was a wavy-haired charismatic possessed of a mellifluous voice and proudly extreme politics, a Christian warrior from Upstate New York who founded Operation Rescue, appeared regularly on national television and denounced murderous abortionists and demonic homosexual sodomites.   Sounds like a nice chap to invite around for Devonshire teas with the folks to talk the awful liberal media, how ignorance is the greatest weapon against pregnancy and how "rump riding" is destroying America [Please insert here the necessary scream followed by the hands thrown in the area with the traditional "Praise the Lord" as the banjo playing bible thumpers are worked up by our little show man]   Randall Terry adopted Jamiel, and Jamiel became his adoring son. He rose to his father's defence during an unsuccessful congressional race. And he joined his dad in taking up the rhetorical sword to fight against homosexual civil unions in Vermont in 2000.  Theirs was a righteous narrative of father and son. Until Jamiel decided to write a new chapter.   Yes folks, we all know where this is heading. Remember the saying by Chris Rock when he was performing at the Apollo, "Whoever you hate WILL end up in your family. If you're homophobic, you gonna have a gay son." Oops, I've give too much away already ;-)   "It's hard to point to one moment when you begin to come out to yourself," Jamiel begins his essay in the May issue of Out magazine, which appears on newsstands this week, "but if I had to, I'd go back to a night seven years ago when I was 17 . . . in my old bedroom at my parents' house . . . where my friend 'Johnny' and I had just finished fooling around."  This was the moment, Jamiel wrote, when he realized he was gay.   And this is the moment when hell, fire and brimstone was sprayed down on their house by the ever so caring and loving father [insert rolling of eyes]   Jamiel, 24, has close-cropped hair, mocha colouring and a stud under his lower lip. He's handsome and articulate, with the preternatural ease in the spotlight found in celebrity children. He lounges in a white leather chair in a friend's house in suburban Charlotte and talks of his decision to bear public witness to his sexuality.  He wrote his article, he says, to help children of Christian fundamentalists deal with their own sexuality. Maybe he also wrote to help his father understand him. Or maybe he wrote to make him understand something else.   Sounds like a noble cause, but lets remember, the ultimate cornerstone of  every  fundamentalist; be it Christian, Muslim or Jewish, is ignorance followed closely by arrogance, which keeps the ignorance in check (ever notice when you challenge a fundamentalist Christians belief, their first weapon is defence, followed by slander with screaming and yelling coming a close third) and denial.  If people are bought up in this sort of environment, the likelihood of them actually acknowledging their sexuality is very low, and this compounded by the fact that home schooling encourages this insular attitude to the world around them, the chance of them seeking help outside the family unit is even lower.  Its the equivalence of these children living in North Korea where they're taught to praise Kim Jong Il and never question decisions "made by the peoples workers party or our great leader".   A few years back, Randall Terry divorced his wife, Cindy -- who once said her husband was touched by the divine -- and married a much younger woman. (Terry's ex barely speaks to him anymore.) Their four children say they still love their father but the relationship has frayed. Terry recently barred one of his adopted teenage daughters from his house after she got pregnant out of wedlock for the second time. Another adopted daughter also became pregnant as a teenager and later converted to Islam, a religion Terry has described as composed of "murderers" and "terrorists." (The couple's lone biological child, a daughter, is in college.)   Oh, there are the juicy bits. So Randall Terry moves from being "faithful and loyal husband" to "dirty old man looking for better slap 'n tickle in the bedroom".  As for a "religion composed by murders and terrorists", how interesting that his ilk is quite happy to promote criminal activities like  urlLink Army Of God  which approves of the actions of the now convicted murderer Paul Hill.    The night before Jamiel's interview with The Washington Post, Randall Terry drove seven hours from his Florida home to visit Jamiel in Charlotte. Theirs was not a pleasant talk. Why, Randall demanded, didn't you tell me you were thinking of writing this and committing an act of betrayal? I could have helped you with a Christian cure for homosexuality.  Jamiel hikes his eyebrows as he recalls the conversation. "I told him: 'Dad, how was I supposed to tell you? Look at who you are.' "   Oh, goodie a "cure" like "walking classes" to teach one how to walk in a "manly fashion", "voice deepening classes" to curb that campness and let us not forget the hand holding and guitar playing classes where they all sit around talking about their feelings whilst claiming to each other they're receiving the "holy spirit".  Please, the success rate of these "clinics" are so dodgy, I've got a better chance of training my cat how to woof, and even if I did achieve this feet, it would change the fact that it is still a cat. Denial is a wonderful thing, and it is one of the three cornerstones of fundamentalism (as mentioned previously).   'My Prodigal Son'  You pick up the telephone and there's Randall Terry, as folksy and pained as could be.  "I'm distressed, man," he says. "This is absolutely the most gut-wrenching thing I've ever gone through. Man, I'm grieving."  You're a father, he says to the reporter. You know my pain. I tried, Randall says, to talk my son out of going public, but Jamiel paid me no heed. I tried to explain the ramifications, but Jamiel turned a deaf ear.   What ramifications? the fact that it could possibly affect his (Randall's) empire building? the fact that he could possibly have a happy son who is secure with knowing who he truly is rather than being told what he is by his father.   So Randall, 45, did what made sense to him as a father, not to mention to a man who harbours hopes of regaining a leadership role in the Christian evangelical and antiabortion movement. (The pastor of his previous church -- the Landmark Church of Binghamton, N.Y. -- unceremoniously tossed him out when he divorced his wife.) Before Jamiel's article could appear, Randall wrote his own, and titled it "My Prodigal Son, the Homosexual."   So in other words, this was all part of Randall's empire building game; great the model family, have the perfect wife and children; if he plays his cards rights, he gets top job in the local "we hate women having a choice" foundation.   He posted this essay on several Web sites, including his own, RandallTerry.com. He wrote of his love for Jamiel and his son's gifts -- his keen mind, singing voice and cooking skill. But Randall cautions that one must understand this about his son: The Terrys rescued Jamiel from a very dark home. Jamiel was born in jail, a victim of "crimes and treacheries" too terrible to spell out (if not too terrible for a father to hint at). Jamiel is a liar who's led a double life.  "My son's life," Randall wrote, "is a shambles."  As open letters go from father to son, it's quite extraordinary. Did Randall wrestle with doubt before putting such an unsparing document on Web sites and later publishing a version of it in the Washington Times?  "It about tore my heart out to write that column, but Jamiel prostituted my name," Randall says. "The truth is that Jamiel is not trustworthy. The truth is that his life is one long deception. May God have mercy. May Christ have mercy."   When in doubt, slander the gay. You'd think that our old friend Randall would come out with something a little more original, but hey, we live in hope.   Family Affair  Families surely are a most inscrutable product of God's hand. Who should know this better than Randall Terry?  Randall came rambling out of the capacious lands of northern New York. His grandmother was a civil rights activist, his aunts were strong feminists -- one would later serve as spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Rochester. Randall, as this aunt once noted with intentional irony, was raised at the knees of feminists.   Hmm, and using this, he should have turned out to be a genuine, tree hugging, pro-choice, gay friendly and open minded individual. I guess nurture doesn't always have the final say on matters.   Randall, though, was sweetly oblivious. He played a mean guitar and piano, and smoked bodacious amounts of herb. He was going to be a rock-and-roll star. A bright kid, he dropped out of high school a few months short of graduation, stuck out a thumb and disappeared into the West.  A few months and boatloads of dope and magic mushrooms later, he washed ashore in Galveston, Tex. He had his epiphany in a diner and that was that. Randall Terry never had much trouble divining God's will after that -- the transmissions were crystal clear.   Translation; he saw an evangelical one night on television screaming hell, fire and brimstone and thought, "f**k, anyone could do that, and going by the expensive suite and hair styling, he must rake in the cash! oh, and check out that music set, what a show man".   Terry returned to Rochester and began talking of God and hellfire, and selling used cars. Once he fell to his knees by the side of a highway and beseeched the Lord to forgive his sins. He enrolled in a Bible school, where he met his wife, Cindy. They talked of serving as missionaries in Central America. But "God interrupted" and delivered unto Terry a vision of a battle plan to fight abortion.   Translation: There is a new opening in the God reselling business and it appears to be in the anti-abortion screaming section! great, these people are nuts, have money and it'll provide me with a nice little thing to do and won't require me to do any real work apart from appearing at rallies, scream the rant and go home. Not too bad for 4hours work each week.   Terry read civil rights tracts, including Coretta Scott King's memoir, and slowly hatched a plan. In 1986 he founded Operation Rescue. This would become a significant moment in the history of the Christian right, the first time an evangelical general would wield the tools of civil disobedience in the service of the antiabortion cause.   Translation: Randall needed a more formal organisation for his business venture to work, so he formed the Operation Rescue Corporation with its sole aim to suck cash from its supports, scream and rant about topics that 95% quite frankly couldn't give two hoots about and keep bringing in the sheep for more indoctrination.   In 1988, Terry and his legions started standing in front of local abortion clinics, screaming and pleading with pregnant women to turn away. They tossed their bodies against car doors to keep abortion patients from getting out. They waved crucifixes and screamed "Mommy, Mommy" at the women. When Terry commanded, hundreds went jellyfish-limp and blockaded the "death clinics."  In 1989, a "Holy Week of Rescue" shut down a family planning clinic in Los Angeles. More than 40,000 people were arrested in these demonstrations over four years. Subtlety wasn't Terry's thing -- he described Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, as a "whore" and an "adulteress" and arranged to have a dead fetus presented to Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. (He also opposed birth control and divorce -- "Families," he wrote in his 1995 book "The Judgment of God," "are destroyed as a father vents his mid life crisis by abandoning his wife for a 'younger, prettier model.' ")   The old Christian Fundamentalist Pastors excuse for everything, "the rules don't apply to me because I receive devine revelation!"   A few years earlier came a day that looms large in the Legend of Randall Terry. Terry had stopped a troubled young woman outside an abortion clinic and persuaded her to bring her pregnancy to term. The baby, Tila, was born in 1985.  "After I saved Tila's life, we helped her mother out with baby furniture and clothes," Terry recalls. "We became more and more involved with her family. The children stayed with us for summers, holidays, weekends."  In 1987, Randall and Cindy agreed to take in Tila and her older brother, Jamiel, then 8, and his older sister, Ebony, as foster children. In 1994, they formally adopted Tila and Jamiel. The children are biracial. Their biological mother, who was white, has since died.  Randall circulated a résumé at the time that described his family. "Children: One by birth and three black foster children."  Terry's fame arced high during this time, his days and nights a blur of airports and appearances on "Crossfire" and "Nightline." ("Did you see my sound bites?" he'd inquire when reporters called for interviews in the late 1980s.)   Well, operation, "I have a nice perfect family" is now working, now onto step two of "theocratising the United States".   The family lived in a Victorian home set in the rolling farmland outside Binghamton in south central New York. Randall was the outsize patriarch, his energy inexhaustible, his laughter infectious, his control considerable. He read everything, sang like an angel and played that piano. At night, he'd tuck in the children and pray with them.  "I idolized my dad. He's a very magnetic person and my best friend," Jamiel says. "He was running a major national organization, we'd have all sorts of guests -- Jerry Falwell came by.  "Our life was never boring."  Randall takes pride in saying he shielded his family from the media spotlight. But the membrane between public and private life can be porous for a movement man. When Randall ran for Congress in 1998 and faced charges of racism, Jamiel stepped forward. Identifying himself as a person of colour, Jamiel demanded that his father's opponent apologize.  It's hard to know after talking with Jamiel and his sisters how much of their narrative is reality and how much desire. They insist their childhood was happy even as they say their parents' unyielding moral code allowed for few adolescent stumbles. They were to study the Bible and live its word. They were schooled at home and in fundamentalist schools. R-rated movies were out. So was divorce and any talk of sexuality.  "My parents were very strict and sheltering," recalls Tila, a startling 18-year-old beauty who is unmarried and now pregnant for the second time. "They were very loving but we never talked about anything."   Interesting to note; Tila was almost exclusively bought up by Randall and look at the net result of it; a daughter, 18 years old and pregnant with her second child; it speaks volumes in terms of success, or their lack of, of their "no sex talk" philosophy.  As I said previously, their whole existence is based around the tripod fundamentalism; Ignorance, Arrogance and Denial. Denial and Ignorance play a big factor in a fundamentalist family; they assume if they kids don't know about it, it won't happen. Using that logic, if they don't watch someone getting punched, they won't punch someone, which is crazy as like sex, there are ingrained things people already know, it is the duty of the parent to teach the child acceptable ways to control/use those ingrained things.   Ebony, now 28, left home when she was 16 and became pregnant soon after. "When you get out of a family with very strict rules, you are exposed to so much," she says. "You discover how easy it is to make the wrong choice."   Yeap, and this is the negative spin off of the tripod of fundamentalism.   When his parents divorced, Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years. At 16, Jamiel was a summer intern with the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by the Rev. Pat Robertson. Afterward, Jamiel announced that he wanted to become a chef.  His father was not amused.  "He told me I could leave his house at that very moment," Jamiel recalls. "He wanted me to be a lawyer, a judge, in the movement. He told me he'd cut me off cold if I became a chef."   Interesting how this is part of Randall's whole empire building game; "Stuff the kids, screw the the wife, I want my empire god damn it, and I want it now!". Sounds like another money and power hungry individual who is more concerned with control and manuplating those around him for his own "grand plan" than actually listening and being the supposed father figure he makes himself out to be.   Awakening  At the time, Jamiel was beginning to wrestle with a far greater inner conflict -- his own sexuality. Asked if he tried to broach this subject with his parents, Jamiel returns a look that suggests you're on crack. As he noted in Out magazine: "When you grow up in a house where to be the thing you are is an abominable sin, you tend to try and shed those behaviors."  He practiced deepening his voice. He avoided anything hinting of the effeminate. And he dated girls even as he fooled around with male friends in his bedroom. "It was so secret and so hidden, I don't think I even felt the weight of it," Jamiel says.   Haven't we all tried that? Heck, I remember back when I was 14 trying to deny that I was gay; from trying to act tough, to talking with a low voice, heck, even tried to take up "tough" sport to prove I was a "rough 'n tough bloke" when in actual fact I was a "pretty fairy who preferred public speaking and debates".   Sometimes he'd sneak into his father's library late at night and look at his collection of books on gays and gay life (Terry maintained the collection so he could speak with authority on such questions).  "I looked at the pictures of shirtless men," Jamiel wrote. "I even picked up some useful knowledge about safe sex from these volumes."  An air of cognitive dissonance attends to this voyage of discovery, to his navigation between nights of desire and days of self-loathing. A 20-year-old Jamiel did a stint with the short-lived Steve Forbes for President 2000 campaign. Later he repaired to Vermont to help his father campaign against gay civil unions.  It was an awkward reunion. Randall Terry recently had separated from Cindy and taken up with a young former housekeeper and aide. He was shunned by many friends and activists in the antiabortion movement. Randall moved for a while to Nashville and tried his hand at country music. (He recently cut a second album with Ronnie Milsap's band. "It's to die for, man," Randall says.)   About the only thing I can say here is good on those who shunned Randall after the divorce, especially after he screamed about the evils of divorce, abortion and homosexuality.   "My father kept saying, 'It's no one's business that I got divorced,' " Jamiel recalls. "I'd tell him: 'Dad, you sent out 100,000 Christmas cards with pictures of our perfect Christian family. You led Christian workshops on being a good husband. That's why people are disappointed.' "  Randall conceded that Jamiel had a point.   Yes, and maybe you should also recant on your comments regarding homosexuality and abortion as these both can be classified under the "It's no one's business that I got/am [homosexual/abortion]".   Now Randall plunged into his second act, as an anti-gay-rights crusader, heading an organization called Loyal Opposition.  "The Bible," Randall notes, "doesn't condemn divorce, but it does condemn homosexuality."  He opened an office in Montpelier, within sight of Vermont's gold-domed Capitol building. One day he walked outside the capitol during a legislative vote and shook his head as though to dislodge images too horrible for words.  "It's hideous in there, man," he told reporters. "It's unbelievable. It's demonic."   When in doubt, and lost all credibility, move to a new state and start a new hate crusade! Btw Randall, the bible does (according to most in your ilk) condemn divorce, according to the Catholic Church, which for 1500, before the Protestant reformation, claimed that a divorce as immoral and even then, there are still Protestants who believe that divorce is immoral.  Then again, we're talking about a person who makes the rules as he goes along. When they affect him, he'll change/tweak them to suit his agenda. He is like the populist politician who changes with the wind.   Jamiel felt a little queasy about the whole undertaking. But that didn't stop him from staying on in Vermont. Jamiel isn't particularly good at articulating, what, precisely he was thinking.  "I felt very hypocritical," he acknowledges. "I would get these angry phone calls from gays and I wanted to say: 'I know, I know, I'm gay, too!' "  Soon Jamiel quit and headed south. Many months later, he told his family that he was gay. His mother thought he was having a nervous breakdown. His father offered to send Jamiel away for a three-month Christian cure. Jamiel declined the offer.   And I say, good for you. The only thing you would get out of this so-called "Christian cure" is the ability to play the guitar, a few happy-go-lucky songs and possibly some new acclamations one can scream out when at church whilst claiming you're receiving the holy spirit.   "I'm going to be at your funeral," Randall told his son. "You'll be dead by 40."   Don't ya just love good old-fashioned Christian forgiveness and love ;-)   These were months of deep struggle, a time during which Jamiel thought more than once of suicide. Eventually, he came to a point of calm and thought of writing about his struggle. After a fashion, he sees himself acting on his father's teachings.  "We were taught that if you saw pain in the world, you should speak out," he says. "I knew that because of my name I could get published and help young men and women who are gay and struggling because of their religious upbringing.  "I was raised in a family where it's immoral to see a problem and remain silent."   That must be about the only thing one can say that Randall taught that was actually a useful skill.   Randall's Lament  "The only reason you want to talk with me is because his last name is Terry. He's playing you and he's prostituting my name."  So the father talks about the son whom he raised to adulthood. In a long phone conversation, Randall Terry says his son is lost, a drug user and a liar who has written bad checks. Randall says Out magazine paid Jamiel $5,000 to write the article and become its "homosexual poster boy." Randall says the magazine's editors "put words in my son's mouth."  (For the record, Jamiel and the editors of Out say much of this is wrong. Jamiel says he sought out the magazine because he felt an obligation to help those struggling with their own sexual identity. He was paid roughly $2,500. While his account was edited, Jamiel claims ownership of the words.)  In Randall's view, most -- no, make that all -- of Jamiel's problems arise from his formative years in his biological mom's home.  "Tragically," Randall writes in his online essay, "by the time we got him as a foster child, he had already learned a lifestyle of deceit. . . . My hope was that providing a loving safe home, his life would be spared. . . . Unfortunately, my hopes and prayers were not realized."  Randall, by turns, is voluble and pained at what he says is a media intrusion into his privacy and that of his family. Then he puts his mother -- Jamiel's grandmother -- on the phone to talk about Jamiel's problems. Then Randall gets back on the phone and demands to know: Did Jamiel tell you what his biological mother did for a living?  The reporter replies that Jamiel and Tila describe their biological mother as more child than adult, a thoroughly lost woman of the street.  Randall exhales into the phone, disgusted. "Dealing with Jamiel is like dealing with his biological mother -- you never know when he's playing you," he says. "I will tell you for sure: Jamiel's mother was a prostitute."  "God rest her soul," he adds.  Brick by brick, Randall dismantles the House of Terry. He says Jamiel has been bounced from three colleges and tries to suck up to wealthy family friends. Randall had to bar Tila from his house because, he says, "to quote an AA phrase, her life just became more and more unmanageable."  As for Ebony, she left home as a teenager and became pregnant. But their relationship is good. At least, he says, she's honest.  By the way, Terry adds, you do know that I never officially adopted her?  Since leaving the Terry home, Ebony has become a Muslim, a conversion she attributes -- for better and worse -- to her upbringing.  "We learned that, nine times out of 10, if someone is being persecuted for their religion, there's probably some truth to the religion," Ebony says. "And the Christian community is supposed to stand for forgiveness and charity, but my experience hasn't been entirely positive."  The irony is that Jamiel's essay is quite a tender piece. He describes a loving childhood, writes of his love for his father, and concludes with a vision of future reconciliation. Even Randall, who will be in Washington this Sunday protesting a massive abortion rights rally, acknowledges the essay could have been worse.  "Overall, the article isn't unfair to me," he says. "But that isn't the issue. He prostituted my name."  Hours later, Jamiel is told of his father's counterattack. He sighs. Jamiel acknowledges he's had a troubled time these past few years, with a drunken-driving conviction and some bad checks.  "Dad doesn't mess around with Tomahawks, he sends in the nuclear warheads," Jamiel says. "My father's first and foremost aim is to protect himself. He talks about how I prostitute the family's name, but he's used the fact that he saved my sister from abortion and rescued me from hardship in his speeches and interviews. What's the difference?"  Jamiel pauses and adds: "My father talks about how deceitful I am. But I was 11, 12, 13, 14. How was I supposed to make sense, in a family that didn't talk about it, of what I was feeling? How am I deceitful?"  "I still fight the thought that I'm committing a mortal sin." There's a moment of silence and Jamiel continues. "God knows my heart. Randall Terry doesn't know my heart."   So in a nutshell the children saw Randall for what he truely is, a power hungry man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He'll bend the rules, change the rules, start up new groups to get his own way.
