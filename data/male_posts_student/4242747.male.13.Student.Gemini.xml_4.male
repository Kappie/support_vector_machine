I don't like the band music E. I stepped in a huge ass wad of gum, now stuck to my k-swiss. F. Since James was sick and Brooke is gone i have rarely a chance to stirke up a good convo. BUT!!! 1. I enjoyed my walk to Covenant talkin to Kevin and listening to Early Days, (note the title of the post) 2. The opener for Covenant Connection was a good time. 3. I got to see Ross, Anne, Heather, and the 2 new people Nick  Laura. 4. I got a free meal. 5. The meal was good. 6. I had barely any homework. 7.
