I didn't get to write in my blog yesterday because of my stupid Japanese homework...so...this is gonna count as yesterdays blog.....because I will most likely write 2 today.....either way It's 6:25 A.M. and I've already been awake for 2 hours....ha ha ha....sux to be you sleeper-inners...I hate you guys. Well, uh.....I've been listening to Get Low for basically a week straight, except when I'm at skool, and I've come to realize, this song rox....but is kinda sick.....but that doesn't take away from its awesomeness.  I added another two people to my MSN list, Steph and Sam...so that brings the grand total to......35!  Wow, I didn't know that that many people knew me....apparently they do.....w00t! Man, this DDR/LAN tomorrow could be very interesting.....including spilled blood..which would suck.....because as far as I know, a few of the people going are having sum quarells, I believe I'm in one of them, but...I'm not a participant...I am just disliked....but..I don't kare, I'm going anyway, and I'm gonna have fun, and there's a few things you could do about it...but I hope you don't. I think I've run out of things to say for the moment...besides the fact that it's A SNOW DAY!!!!!! Peace  Spense
