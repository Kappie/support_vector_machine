As Christ is a divine person, He is infinitely holy and just; hating sin, and disposed to execute condign punishment for sin. He is the infinitely just Judge of the world and will not at all acquit the wicked, or by any means clear the guilty. Though His justice be so strict with respect to all sin, yet He has grace sufficient for every sinner, and even the chief of sinners."  Excerpt from "The Excellency of Christ" preached at Northampton, 1738  Jonathan Edwards
