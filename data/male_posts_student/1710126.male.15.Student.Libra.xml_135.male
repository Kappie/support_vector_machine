Decisions. Actions. So complex...what would have happened if things happen differently? Would i have been born? hahz. Relationships. Do ppl always fail at them?  Do ppl really understand relationships and their own emotions? Am i gonna be juz another brick in the wall...another person who spent his entire life trying to find the secret to relationships with frens lovers acquaintances enemies? And failing...  How do u define a successful relationship? or issit ever changing. what would have happened if i didnt do tt? a betta life? a lasting relationship instead of a failed one.  Small actions. Dire consequences. Small mistake. Big losses. I wonder. If problems to relationships will ever be resolved.  How do u even know u are not simply lying to urself?
