Just the same old thing. I woke up (*gasp*), and I ate, and I watched TV, and I rode down to Katie's, and I came home, and that was it. I did see a few good things today. I saw I love the nineties and The Assistant. I reccomend both. The Assistant was the best thing I've seen on MTV in awhile. And that was today. It's funny; I've just summed up about 14 hours of life in two-and-a-half paragraphs.
