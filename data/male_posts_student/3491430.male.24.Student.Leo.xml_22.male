Because I have been to Paris and Rome, there were not so many exciting places for me. But Venice was a nice place to me, although I lived in a terrible hotel.   In Paris I saw the national firework. It was a fairly splendid thing, although the firework is not new for Chinese. We waited for 2 hours without dinner to see that firework. My mother became not patient. Later at around 10:30 the firework began. At the beginning it was just so so. Later it became better and better. But when we came back, the crowd was like a chaos. Hundreds of people went into subway station. People were like fishes in a can. I was really afraid to lose my mother. Thank god, later we arrived the platform together. We arrived our hotel at 1AM:(.  When I was in Paris, I missed Romain and Julien. I was thinking what you were doing when I was wandering in the crowded street in Paris.   Venice is a nice place. I regret that I had been there so I can not have an exicting honeymoon there. Anyway, I suggest you guys go there with your girlfriends and enjoy the water town.   If I have time, I will write more and better articles for my travel.   The only experience that I got in the travel is that home is always the best place.
