I kno this may seem lyk an english essay but I'm gonna write it neway as I'm bored (unlyk andy wen i try to express things which r hard I don't ramble on in canto ^-^, I write about it). This may hv bin influenced my the watchin of Mean Girls but here it goes. also andy feel free 2 delete this if u feel it violates ur rights in ne way or sum lawyer mumbo jumbo.   "I feel" Andy is turning into a girl "i have this weird feeling in my stomach" its called LOVE (insert a certain special sum1 here). "I fell very moody" again this highlights my earlier claims of Andy being a girl... its a sign of PMS and also js general bitchiness. The notion u get from the text is similar to that of a song with whiny lirics. It brings a sad and dreary tone to the text and highlights the changes going on in a persons life. "I've never felt like this before" this is because of the ongoing emotional changes which occur in an adolescent male or female. "life's changed and its so hard to get used to" its changed 4 every1... js slightly differently 4 Andy :P. "you two are the best" the fact that he spills and is comforted by his 'girlfriends' (not in the lovy-dovy kind of way) emphasises the inclination of Andy.   "i feel regretful." this is a common emotion in those suffering from depression and trauma during the teenage years. However this syndrome is temporary and cures when the sufferer attains a new level of maturity. This fact is recognised by the author "i'll be fine. just need some time to think about my life." Another quick but temporary fix is an "ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCHINO".   (>.  shows the emotional changes that go on during the teenage years. The author "Andrew Yeo" tries to express his views using personal experiece, nonsensical whining, the repetition of the word feel and peotic devices to convey his message to the lifeless readers hu visit this blog. He is turning into Annie Yeo, or mAndy as Mrs. Tam puts it :P  Well i cud go on, but i won't   This is totally untrue and is a sadistic attempt by me 2 "blog here to blog, no matter how meaninglessly boring it is" and also to improve my english skills.  note: i cud give u a psychologists view of Granmaster chowy's theory of y this has happened to Andy but I won't. This theory of mine holds true in many other cases... including myself but in slightly different ways, u hv 2 kno the person 2 apply this theory... and also hv certain otha special characteristics so I won't post it here. I believe there is another reason y Andy is suffering this sickness but I won't post it here, its quite simple tho and may surface another time.  Jono
