Here I am at the computer listening to  Damnation and a Day  (I seriously can't stop listening to it) and I am watching VH1's countdown of the "Most Metal Moments".  This has to be the most abhorrent countdown of "metal" I have ever seen.  There has been countless mentions of bands that I would never (and will never) think of as metal.   Motley Crue  is not metal.   Poison  is not metal.   Bon Jovi  is not metal.   Def Leppard  is not metal. (Although the drummer does deserve some credit for losing his arm and coming back to play again)   Stryper  sure as Hades is not metal.  Bands that dress up like women with make-up and teased hair and wear multi-coloured spandex   ARE NOT METAL!   They sing little girly songs with flashy pyro and dancers and little girls in the crowd ogling over them.  They play music that retarded monkeys could play.  The singing sounds like a squirrel who got his testicles caught on a fence.  Yet VH1 still decides to kiss ass and mention these soulless, tasteless wannabes as metal gods.  Metal Gods?   Slayer  are metal Gods   Anthrax  are metal Gods   Pantera  are metal Gods   Exodus  are metal Gods   Megadeth  are metal Gods   Motorhead  are metal Gods  A  Slayer  fan takes a knife and carves "SLAYER" in both of his forearms.  That's metal.   Pantera 's "House of Shock" is metal.   Anthrax  making an MTV appearance and trashes a fan's house is metal.   Gwar  getting in trouble for their bloody stage show is metal... well... sort of.  All of these are very notable metal moments.  However, VH1 had to include at least 10 entries about groupies alone.  I hate to say it, but groupies are not metal.  Any musician will at some point or another get a bunch of groupies. (the exception being  Clay Aiken )   Other entries that did not make sense at all were:   Poison  revolutionise information maitenance system with groupie database.    Ace Frehley claims he was abducted by aliens. (that is not metal, that is just pure lunacy)    Bon Jovi  marks the beginning of hair metal. (in my opinion the darkest day in metal history)   Poison 's C.C. Deville goes throws a fit at the VMA's.     Poison  screen potential groupies with a video camera.     Motley Crue 's Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee compete in a Stink and Scorefest. (a man named Nikki is not metal)    Motley Crue  making fans pee in a kitty litter box to meet them backstage.    Nikki Sixx sets himself on fire.    Here's the worst one:  Motley Crue 's Tommy Lee steers boat without using hands.  YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!!   That  is the #21 top metal moment?  I drive with out using my hands when I'm on the phone or when I'm changing the radio station or when I am trying to reach in my bookbag for a CD to put in.  Is that metal?  No, that's just me stupidly endangering my life because I am trying to do too many things at once.  As a true metal fan, that countdown sickened me.  I am tired of the old people at VH1 thinking they know everything about metal, having a countdown, and loading it up with washed up hair metal bands.  That's why I fully endorse the upstart music channel Fuse.  They are primarily a rock channel, but when they do metal, they do it damn well.  Their metal show "Uranium" is hosted by the beautiful and very metal Juliya Chernetsky.  This show plays balls out metal all the time.  You will see the bands appear on "Uranium" nowhere else .  When was the last time you saw  Children of Bodom  on VH1?  My point exactly.  The lovely metal goddess: Juliya    So after a while of watching that disgrace to metal, I went to Mickey D's to get food for me, my mum, my dad, my cousin, and my aunt.  I went up to the cashier (who was  very  hot) and ordered four salads, a happy meal, a #3, and a double cheeseburger.  So I was getting my drink and when I got back, I saw a huge ass bag and the happy meal and I thought that everything was there so I took it and left.  I felt like an idiot b/c I was struggling to carry all of that out.  I got home and discovered that the only thing in the huge ass bag were two salads.  So I had to go back, get the two other salads which were in another huge ass bag, the #3, and the double cheeseburger.  The cashier must have recognised me b/c she immediately said you forgot something.  I replied bashfully, yeah, I know.  So after sorting the whole mess out with the manager, I got my food and took off, but not before I thanked the cashier again.  She smiled and replied, no problem.  Oh yeah, she wants me. ;)  So I went home and ate my first meal of the day.  It was 14:45.  That's 2:45 PM if you don't speak European.  I was in a great mood.  I got McDonalds, flirted with the hot cashier, and in 15 minutes, the Fire game was going to come on.  I was enjoying the game when around the 38th minute ESPN commentator Rob Stone stopped his colour commentary to say that ESPN 2 was moving coverage to WNBA Basketball and the Fire game can be seen in its entirety later tonight.  I was absolutely livid!  Why did we have to get bumped off of the air for WOMEN'S BASKETBALL?!?!  And what caused this happen?  Well, President Reagan died, so I understood why ABC went to Breaking News coverage, but I was  insulted  by the fact that MLS got pre-empted by the WNBA.  I mean, I understand that the WNBA is a new league and they are trying just as hard as MLS to get attention, but what bites my bum is the fact that they get ABC airtime on a silver platter while we get cheap ESPN 2 airtime that is often taken away from us by tennis and the Little League World Series, and now women's basketball.  It really really sucks being a soccer fan in America.  If we were in Europe, a nuclear war wouldn't cut into a soccer match.  That's why I can't wait to get to Italy.  They are as passionate as I am about soccer.  I doubt they even care women play basketball.  I doubt they even  know  women play basketball.  Well I'm off to watch the Fire game on tape delay.  As for you ESPN, I guarantee a venomous e-mail is coming your way.  Especially now that you got the Metrostars v. Dallas score on your sports ticker thing wrong.  Dallas won 2-0 not 3-0.  You are totally soccer inept.  I can't wait to get my degree in statistics and flood your sports ticker with soccer stats from Botswana.  Then you will pay for your injustices against the beautiful game.   Bwaaa hahahaha!!!
