They were missing a lot of serve and jus makin mistakez, and we jus took it too em 25-15. The 2nd game, we jus came out flat and jus didnt play up to our potential, vance was bangin and we jus made a hella a lot of mistakez...so we ended up losing 18-25. Since we lost, i guess our whole mentality was jus...blah...then the 3rd game was jus terror, we kept on gettin aced time and time again by eric and then our serving was very weak...especially at my part...so we ended up losing badly 15-25...down 2 gamez to 1...casey told us the "two bullz" story...and he actually got it right...hahahah. The the forth game it was time to turn it up. It was back and forth and our defense and our serving won it for us 25-20...then the final 5th game...were it all comez down to this...we ended up wit an early lead 6-4..then suddenly we messsed on  a few thingz and it was back to 6-8...then jus kill after kill...it ended up 13-14...a long rally began, and it took forever!!!!...then finally i some how managed to block corey and tied it up at 14z...then corey messed up on a tip that gave us the lead 15-14...then for match point...another long rally happened and finally on the 2nd ball, i tipped it down wit my left hand to win the match and ensure us of 1st place...i couldnt believe it...i was so stoked and i thought i was jus gonna break down and cry...but im saving those tearz for CIF...then a guy from star interviewed me, and i sounded all professional...hahah...well yeah...it was insane...payce.
