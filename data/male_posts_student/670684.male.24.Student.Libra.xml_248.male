In Elementary School, I was too busy playing handball or finding other trouble with my Chaparral mates to think about girls...I remember my sister asking me to support her as she stormed the Principal's office and demanded that Chaparral Elementary allow its students to kiss...I didn't know anyone at Chaparral would be interested in kissing.    Even if they were, they weren't any good.    I had a lot of crushes in middle school, namely on Nicole Cruse and Laura Odeh, two girls who would later star in mid-90s alternative cliques, but at this point were just unique cuts against the flashy money grain of Southern California.  And I did kiss a girl, Jennifer Fjelstad, who I knew from years before at Violet Capriotti's day care (de do de-do!)...we kissed because "A kiss is nothing between actors," but Chris Garnier was right, it was my first kiss.  I moved to Arkansas at the end of my seventh grade year, passed up an opportunity to sit next to Cara Roop and wow her with my Californianess, ended up taking the seat in front of Jesse Hopkins instead, and worked from that disadvantage for several years of Rogers instruction.    The summer of 1993 rolled around...I had toiled through a pretty bad year of 8th grade, making a 3.5 on the skinniest skin of my ass, doing the least bit possible for each grade I received.  I longed for California, for the area that seemed familiar, that didn't smell like Tyson Chicken, where I got to go to beautiful restaurants on the Pacific Ocean, eat at Ben  Jerrys, gorge myself strip malls and all things commercial.  Rogers was where my mom's family lived, the family whose carpet was a relic of 1971 and whose family members went by Hoss and Shorty.  California had art, culture, pretention.    My mom and sister decided to take a vacation that summer...my mom told me that if I wanted to go, I would have to pay for it.  This was not her way of torturing her son in a gender-backward contemporary Cinderella...she had no money.  Paid $21.50/hr in California at the end of 1991, she took a job doing the same thing in Arkansas for $8.50 in April 1992.  Money was so tight that I paid our monthly phone bill out of my college savings, so I could talk to my dad once a week.    I wasn't getting along with the mom or her family, some because I was a hormone-driven new adolescent, some because I hated my mother for taking me from California.  I chose the free vacation with my dad, where he would buy me things and take me places and do things Disneyland.    I did the vacation with my dad.  He bought me things, took me places, and did things Disneyland.  I saw old friends Colin and Michael, who played lots of the famed Sega Genesis video game ROAD RAGE.  They even had nicknames based on the characters.  Life was back to normal.  I loved it.  I so loved it that at the end, I decided I would move back to California.  The only problem was that I had a committment with the University of Arkansas Summer Music Camp, occuring one day after I returned from California.    I probably put 20 minutes of practice into my music, getting curt replies from my mom about not being prepared and wasting the school's money.  It didn't matter.  We pulled up to Pomfret Hall, she unloaded my stuff, and I moved into my dorm room.  I don't remember if she helped me.  Maybe.  Yes, I think she did.  And I think she drove me up to the Band Hall for my audition.  I waved, she dropped me off, and I counted the days until Arkansas would be a memory.    The sound upon opening the door of the Band Hall (I don't think it has a name...where we rehearsed that year was called Kimpel Hall, and later I would rehearse in the Walton Arts Center, but our auditions and my Timothy Thompson private lessons during my senior year of high school were in this unnamed band hall) was innordinate din.  Flutes, tubas, euphoniums, oboes, percussion...a medley of poorly tuned, poorly prepared players greeted my arrival.  Kids were huddled against lockers and in corners, positioning their music in the most feasable position to get the last strand of practice in.  At this point, for the first point in my life, I felt unprepared musically.  I found a cubbie, got out the horn, and gave the beast a go.  It was working alright, but a month of no practice killed my endurance, something I couldn't fake in the audition.  Somehow I knew to just go and play, rather than wait an hour hoping to find glory.  I went in, played my piece.  She asked why I hadn't practiced.  I asked if it was that bad.  She said no, you're a good player, that's why it's obvious you haven't practiced.    I meandered back to the dorm by myself.  It was a beautiful day, and the walk from the band area of campus down to Pomfret is one of the great Arkansas walks...you start up a large hill, cut through a forest, and pass behind Kimpel to come out near the union, from where it's down a small drive past Brough to the band hall, as well as the Chi Omega Greek Theatre.  I never make that hike when I visit Arkansas, and I should.  Here is where the memory lacks.  I played grabass for a while in my less than happening room.  My roommate, Kyle McNitt, a great guy whose current claim to fame is that he was my first friend to have a colonostimy, had Sam's Club flavored waters and even a poster of the UA Golf Team above his bed.  I had my plane tickets from California, and a number for the Jim Rome show, which I planned to call religiously, providing Rome with the Arkansas Account on the world of sports.    Somehow, we met up with Tim Moser and Jackson Jennings, two yonger guys from Rogers, and the four of us decided to meet up with some other Rogers folks, being Dana Bamburack and someone else.  If it was Nicole Villarreal, the story would come full circle.  But I don't think it was, even though she was Dana's best friend.  Dana and I got to talking.  She wasn't attractive...yet.  She had Sally Jesse Raphael glasses, squinty eyes, chubby cheeks, and a complete lack of breastage.  But she had promise she would fulfill.  And she was attracted to me.    I remember that I was warned about some little man who was dating Dana, a man that I thought of and always consider to look like  urlLink Jonathan Lipnicki .  And I didn't really seem to care.  I wasn't jealous, I wasn't afraid...I was just having conversations with Dana Bamburack.  We would talk on the phone, sometimes so much that Kyle would get upset with me.  We would talk at lunch.  We would never hold hands, but we would position our bodies as close to one another so that we could sometimes accidentally touch.  She was interested in music, dance, and a bit in education.  She liked my jokes.  She didn't like my pranks, causing me to come up with my favorite quote of mine until I was 15 and learned how to come up with a good quote,  80 percent of what I say is in jest, and the other 20 should be .  But she forgave.  And she sat next to me.  And we looked at each other.  And my mouth would dry, my hands get clammy, and I sometimes stammered.  I felt like I had known her forever.    And this all happened over two days.  She went kind of nuts, we broke up that Tuesday (Band Camp started on Sunday), tried again Wednesday, failed, and I danced the last slow song with a crying Dana at the Friday dance, to Eric Clapton's  Tears In Heaven .  That fall, we would start dating, date maybe a month, and break up for no apparent reason, other than I was in the 9th grade, I didn't really care about having a girlfriend, and it seemed like the best thing at the time.  Dana moved at the end of that year, I dated a different friend of hers years later, who I failed to kiss, and I am sure that now Dana Bamburack is an effervescent, hot 23 year old college graduate engaged to a frat guy.  I wish I could say that I hoped she would help starving children or follow music, but I don't remember...in all of the great conversations Dana and I had those two days, I don't think we ever learned anything about each other.  And months later, walking to Elmwood Junior High with Daniel Harr and Chris Faulkenberry to play in the Elmwood Pep Band because Beth Carter asked us too, Daniel mentioned Dana.  And we all laughed a bit.  And somehow I remembered that before that Band Camp, I was ready to move from Arkansas for good.  And somehow Dana, this girl that we all made fun of every time we'd see her at Corn Dog 7 hanging out with the skater kid she used to make me jealous, was the reason I was still here.
