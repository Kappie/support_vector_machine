The guy doesn't even remeber fucking up my car. SO, I told him I wasn't even going to consider dropping the charges until I get my car back, fixed and in my possession. For covering my own ass like that I get called a "bastard" and a "douchebag" by his friend, who happened to be in the car with him when he pulled this shit. Doesn't make sense to me. It's now all MY fault. Bullshit. If you want to sit there and call me a douchebag and a bastard, you can fucking kiss my ass. Zeke doesn't realize that this whole situation could have been avoided by him NOT FUCKING drinking. Sneaking Malt Liqour into a movie, getting so wasted that you don't even remember the last half of  it, then stealing your friends car and fucking it up. Throughout this whole process I've been thinking "Who does that kinda shit?" I know who does, and he's not a good friend nor a good person.
