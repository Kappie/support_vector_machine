Well, Jien likes it, and that's good enough. *grin*  ------  whispersmurmersemotionalflickerings toss and tumble, light up the night midnight past and still they dance through silence serene, through love and laughter to pierce my soul, to bind in truth demanding utterance, burn and dance.  burn and dance. the tumbling of truth in clumsy phrases that demand their voice for what would love be made in quiet choice if we were afraid and silent shame reigned instead?  daylight spent waiting, nights frittered in dreams new longing in waking new twinges, new achings a meeting of souls, to mingle and fuse to stretch, to blossom to grow in hope, to grow in truth.  confusion that hovers in peripherial whirlings, whirling and wishing, silent and waiting tingle to see, in this inbred uncertainty.  freed from me; to live, to be empty, yet filled; incomplete, yet whole in you.  12.8.2004
