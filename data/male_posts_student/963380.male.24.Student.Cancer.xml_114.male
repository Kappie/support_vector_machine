Thankfully it was his desire to do so; he did give me some insight as to how things work higher up the ladder. Getting to the point where I'm fairly sure it's not what I want to pursue - even in the short term. That's rather sad.  There's a swamp in my basement. A lake. A reflecting pool if you will.  Thank fuck I'm out of here shortly. The couch is up on blocks. Life vests are issued to those heading into it's confines. All hands, abandon ship!  Season 2 of DS9 came out today. It's a great series and I'm looking forward to actually getting to know it for the first time.  Zelda continues to be one of the most fun video games I've ever played. I wish every video game experience were like this. Nintendo - you may not have the fastest system or the largest selection of games - but as long as you've got Mario, Samus, Fox McCloud and Link, I'll be buying whatever system you put on the shelf.  Exception being the Nintendo 64. I was on hiatus from videogames at that point, I do apologize. Then again, y'all made the Nintendo64, you should be apologizing to me.
