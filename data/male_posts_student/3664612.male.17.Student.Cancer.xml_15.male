Anyways it wasnt much fun so ill talk about yesterday.  Yesterday was alright nothing big happened except for the dinner with Annisa's family and some Indonesian staff again.....This time I think was better than before, since there was less people. But the food sucked, and I mean really bad, since the food had a bitter after taste o.O. But the view was great. Since we ate at the Sydney Tower which was pretty cool the view from the top was incredible, we could almost see the whole of Sydney, it was the highlight of the evening for me.  Also yesterday was the day I gave the presents I bought for all of my friends in Cita Buana to Annisa. I think I bought presents for Damien, Christina, Annisa, Michael, Zio, Angie, Monita, Angel, Jen, and Yoshi. I only had enough money to buy for those people, so I didnt get the chance to buy one for Jisnu, Will, Michelle and Krisno. Well at least I bought presents for those people. Another reason why I didnt buy presents for them was I didnt want to trouble Annisa too much since she's the one bringing it to Jakarta. Now the thing is about the dinner is that, i had that thought again (for those who want to know the thought please read laughable) I still dont know why it only happens when i see her, i mean i spent most of the time trying to make the thought go away. Argh!! what does it mean! Does it mean i still have a bit of feelings for her or i regret breaking up with her. Bah, i think those two answers are wrong anyways. Maybe its just because i never expected her to come to Australia, and actually meeting her. So ill end it here, fudge out.....
