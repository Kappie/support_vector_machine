If she doesn't have an email adress then I'll either have to do it in letter form or get her phone number. Brilliant, isn't it? Ah well, quite proud that I found out otherwise. I did go through Alice to do it but when she's sitting on the outside...  It's nice to see Sam's blog returning to some state of usual-ness. Normality is probably the word I'm looking for. Hooray. I smiled quite broadly after reading the bit about killing the Roskillys, I like the fact there's some kind of normality coming back to life.  Despite not wanting to cast any darkness on Sam's blog (which I have become excessively pleased about), I have to comment on her remark about funerals, namely; "Why, when someone dies do I have the urge to laugh at everyone's belief that by giving them a funeral it will help them go to heaven?" I do not mean to criticise her finding this strange, given her new-found atheism. Call it a revelation if you will. Myself, I have never seen funerals as a way to help someone get to heaven, I always see that as slightly far-fetched and shallow. Personally, I believe that funerals are the last great act that people close to the deceased can give to the person pushing up the daisies. The final present, if you will. For me, it is not a bargaining system with God, more a tribute to the life of the person who died. Even if you're a complete dipshit, you must have done something good for someone during your life. This is remembered at your funeral.  On that topic, Mr. Kellie has allowed me to go to John's funeral on Thursday. I'm pleased about that, I really need to go. What is it about funerals and people thinking they need to go on an emotional basis? I don't know. But I do.  Anyway, I'll blog later probably.  Love, Jon Roskilly
