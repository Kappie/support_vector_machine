So DT, my laptop customer the other day brought me a bag of stupid. Not his, no he's a pretty cool guy. Instead, the bag of stupid is care of someone who's apparently the smartest person on the planet - cause good god damn, the fucker works at RIM. People, please be aware, just because someone works at a purveyor of technology, it does not equate to them actually having any sort of knowledge in related fields. Translation - DT's buddy created a PPPoE VPN to connect to rogers. Wirelessly. Through a broadband router with a broadband wireless adapter.  If you don't get what goes on there, essentially all you need to do to make that shit work is plug it in. Apparently DT's RIMjob didn't quite gather that. I mean, it's only common fucking knowledge, how should he have garnered it? I swear, at this point, people should have to obtain licenses to reproduce.  Paul's graciously letting me use the WYSE terminal in the tech room for my rant, as I will not be participating on the sales floor today. Frankly, I had it up to the top of my dumb metre only minutes after the store opened. Pity - as I was in good spirits post wakening this morning.  Roz needs to use the computer, so I'm loggin out now.
