(i know becasue i tested it on my AWESOME windows 95 computer) yeah, nobody really needs to know what that means, but it pleased me. and in other techno-babble news my bloody enormous Morrowind download finished. looks like my 2 peers came through, granted they did have like 50.3% average each, so i was all set. and then i left it on to seed! how cool am i!..and that game is going to rock.  also i went to annoy the people who i want to hre me again so that they wouldnt forget me from yesterday. that was loads of fun. now i hget to hunt down some guy in the zoo named mr mikey or something like that. why is getting a job turning into a mystery novel? meh.  it has just occured to me that mabye i should only write in here when something interesting happens. but wheres the fun in that!  yeah, also i spent the remainder of my time thinking about all the time where i was having more fun than i was at that current moment. meaning that i thought alot about my birthday party, which was the single funnest thing ever. yeah, pretty much makes up for any badness in the world i think. mabye thats the meaning of life, hey, to have one incredible experience, and then using that as motivation bring others that moment. well, made sense in my mind anyway. and yay for me, this is the LONGEST entry ever! and we get pizza tonight! so yeah, today was pretty good.
