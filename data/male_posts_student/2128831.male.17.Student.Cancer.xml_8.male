Our young hero is suffering from a constant fever of 103 degrees with an incrediably horrible cough and a sore throat the size of Texas.  His small issue of not sleeping because he is bound and determined to learn all of the music for "The Nutcracker," for his school has slowed him down, but not to the point of stopping him.  His attitude always positive looking ahead, not behind.  His sexy green eyes aglow with passion and desire, he knows what he wants, a spot on the show.  A chance to live out one of his dreams.  Four days in California to prove to himself, he can do whatever his mind wishes.  And, you know it boo!
