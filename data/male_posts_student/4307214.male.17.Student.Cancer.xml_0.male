Long-exposures of cars at night ranked among my favorites. Once I got my camera, I absolutely had to try my hand at them.   urlLink     This is the first long-exposure shot I took that I felt was good enough to keep. On my way home from the mall one night I pulled out my camera and shot about 20 frames of cars passing by a plethora of locations. This was before I got a tripod, so I was resting the camera on concrete barriers, the ground, anything I could find that was more stable than my own two hands.   For this particular shot I set up the camera on a metal pole (the ones that are about 4' tall - I don't know what they're called) at the side of a quieter-than-most-Hong-Kong-roads road, set the shutter for 5 seconds and waited for a car to come by.  Car! Click.  I was immensely happy when I saw the shot - it turned out far better than I expected. The blue headlight streak is, I think, way cooler than the standard yellow/orange color. Also, the blurriness of the leaves (it was pretty windy) add an almost surreal characteristic to the image.  Since I was basically a complete novice of a photographer at that time, I hadn't anticipated the streetlamps to come out so strongly, and especially not in the awesome star-patterns that they did. The brightest lamp really keeps the left side of the shot from being too dull.
