Quarrels after quarrels, just wad is e meaning of dis, i can't reallie get 2 know wad u exactly wan, Jane? Noe y i didn't go ans ur call in e afternoon, cause i was injured, in pain, den dun wan u 2 worry, cause when u were calling it was obvious 2 tell tat i was in pain. When Yu Feng called den i was better, so i ans his call. Dun understand y u were angry just like tat. Jane, i think we r drifted further n further apart le, dun u think so? i certainly think so, even though u sae u were luvin mi more n more each day. Y, Just in e hell y must dis happen, can anyone plzs tell mi y?? Jane, think u have lost trust n faith n luv in/4 mi le, i somehow feel dis way, dun understand y. Even though u wanted 2 meet mi, but it's like only 15 plus mins only den u need 2 go home, den wad's e point, i rather u go home, have a bath n enjoy urself at home, li dat u will feel more comfortable ma, isitz it so?? I'm now seriously considering about our relationship, seriously....Dis post is specially written 4 u 2 read Jane. MAybe i'll cool down after sometime, i just totally upset, depressed n devastated dis few days despite mi crackin some silly jokes in class everyday. Wad e use of always puttin up a brave front n laughter in front of everybody when i'm actually totally upset n depressed deep down inside mi. I'm totally confused rite now, thinking if we should continue our relationship
