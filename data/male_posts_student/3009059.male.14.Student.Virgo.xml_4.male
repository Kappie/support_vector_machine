He denies the fact that Tanniel turns him on, and always says that Tanniel is one of the solar system members, the sun.  I think, Ivan is nuts.  You know what, I believe Ivan is nuts.  Ivan is an annoying fucking bastard.  But as stated, Ivan always goes hot near Tanniel.  Since October 2k3, we already know that Ivan was attracted to subject Fiona Tanniel, for attempting to ask her to watch  The Rundown , by Dwayne Johnson.  We never knew though, subject Ivan was HOT near object Fiona.  This is a very erotic school story, and must be further researched based on observations in upcoming weeks.
