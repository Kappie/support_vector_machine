Now, I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because I AM recommending this flick to any who might not have seen it yet.  In a nutshell, it tells the story of a VERY self-centered radio 'shock-jock' (think Howard Stern - but with a harder edge).  Jack has the 'perfect life' until one of his cold-hearted bits of advice to a regular listener results in disastrous consequences.    Racked with guilt at what he inadvertently causes as a result of his mean-spiritedness (a mass murder and suicide), Jack ends up on skid row.  In fact, if it weren't for the tender mercies of the woman who takes him into her home and into her heart, he would be totally out on the street.  One night, after getting particularly 'liquored-up', Jack ends up on the wrong side of town.  He is accosted by two young hooligans who decide to douse him in gasoline and set him on fire.  Fortunately, he is rescued by the not-altogether-there homeless guy, Parry (played brilliantly by Robin Williams).    The story continues by telling the tale of how Jack tries to 'make it up' to Parry, whose wife was lost in the aforementioned murder/suicide.  Jack actually becomes a compassionate person - perhaps for the first time in his life.  He (for a time at least) ends up meeting and helping out others who, not unlike Parry, are less-fortunate and/or down-on-their-luck.  By way of review, I've got to say right off the bat that this is by no means a 'perfect' movie. It definitely could have done with a bit of judicious editing here and there, IMHO. Nonetheless, it was a brilliant story and had some great performances in it.  I thought Mercedes Ruehl (as Jack's girlfriend) was particularly good - which makes sense, I guess, seeing as how I understand that she took home an Oscar for her trouble!   Beyond all that, I thought that the themes explored in the film were exceptional!  In a lot of ways, this movie dealt with some of the basic tenets of Christianity (compassion for others, true love vs. superficial love, forgiveness, self-sacrifice, redemption, etc.), however I doubt you'll ever find it on the shelf at your local Christian bookstore.  ...Which is sad, really.  It bugs me that 'Christian entertainment' always has to be so antiseptic and whitewashed.   I wish the Christian filmmaking industry could get off their holier-than-thou butts and make some movies that would really speak to the people.  Here's what I say...meet people where they live and stop making it look like that in order to be a Christian you have to come from a smiling, happy, well-dressed, successful, middle-class, two parent and 2.5 kid family - one whose biggest 'adventure' never takes them too far out of the 'burbs.   This is where my own attitude has changed in recent years I guess.  I used to buy into the idea that all Christian media had to be 'wholesome' and have strict 'family values'.  Now that I'm older and more mature - and have been through some rather painful life changes - I realize that we as Christians need to admit that this is an imperfect world that we live in; and that to ignore the hurt and pain and suffering that are going on all around us is to deny the true message of Christ!   Jesus didn't hang out with the wealthy people of his day.  He wasn't hanging out in the suburbs with the middle-class Jews, enjoying some delicious backyard barbecue and Canaanite Cola out by the pool!  No...he was hanging out with the lepers, the prostitutes, the down-on-their-luck, the sinners!  How we as Christians today have gotten away from that simple truth, I REALLY don't understand.   This is where I butt heads with those who want the church to be a 'museum for saints' instead of a 'hospital for sinners' (as my favorite radio preacher, Pastor Greg Laurie, would put it).  Some pastors and church leaders want a tidy little whitebread church where they can show up every Sunday morning seeing well-scrubbed, well-dressed middle class white folk sitting in the pews, hands folded neatly in their laps, waiting to absorb every word that he or she 'brings down from the heavens'.   Meanwhile, some of us (including the extraordinary people behind this 'blog') see the hurt and the poverty and the neglect that is taking place all around us - and we want to reach out in Christ's love to those who are affected.  The gospel, after all, is a message of hope.  Those who are comfortable and happy don't really need hope, now do they?   All right, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Guess I just got all fired up after watching "The Fisher King".  Whaddayaknow...I guess this film touched me pretty deeply.  Amazing, isn't it, that God can use a secular movie to make me feel like I need to seek after him more closely?  But then again, that's His style, isn't it?  ...Using the 'foolish' things of the world to confound the wise?  (1 Corinthians 1:27)   Check this movie out sometime.  See if it doesn't make you think (at the very least) or maybe even change your worldview (at best)!
