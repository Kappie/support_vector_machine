Our final performance was tonight, and we struck the set and props and costumes afterwards while the actors went to eat.  From the sound of it, it wasn't a GREAT deal of fun, but I don't think it was horrible.  I really enjoyed my time here, one way or another.  I met some really cool people.  This is the part of this business that I dislike most of all. Saying good-byes to people I get to know and enjoy spending time with.  I'm almost sad to go back to the real world.  Not only have I made some new friends, but I've really connected and feel like I have some friends that previously were only bosses and supervisors to me.  I have enjoyed their company immensely.  I have really enjoyed working and feeling like I am doing something to work towards a goal, with a team.  This show was something I was pretty proud of.  I enjoy doing this.  I'm tired of college.  I can make money doing this, and I'm making contacts left and right.  ARGH!  Any advice?  Any thoughts?   No?  That's right, you're a computer.
