It was awesome though, I improved my "sexy" tan.   I am so refreshed as well, I slept until 2:30 today, a sleep I really needed. To catch up over the past few days of my insomniac ways.  I have to be up for 7 AM tomorrow, as I have to work at 8 AM. That's an extremely early morning for me, I am going to be pretty burnt out at the end of the day. But oh well, the more money for my trip, the better my trip!  I start my holidays on Wednesday, so I will have a nice break from work, and the best part is, my trip is in 12 days! Winnipeg is going to be awesome, I get to see some people I haven't seen for awhile and have a good time with nobody around but a few friends. No family, no drama, no work, no home, no nothing. Except relaxing and fun :) Everybody needs one of those, you know what I mean. :)  Anyways, I am going to go now. Short post, but I thought I should write something!  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Later all.
