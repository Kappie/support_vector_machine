Fuck I forgot what happened. All I remember is Chris making me crack up like usual. Good old Christopher.  August 3rd - Paul came home early and fucking surprised me while I was sleeping in my room. Then we biked to Heaton's to do the same. Then we went to Matt's but he wasn't home, he was at his cousins and I'm such an ass I forgot he told me 90 times. Us 3 went to Ricky's and hung out with him all day, played Halo. Paul slept on Ricky's couch because he hadn't slept in 2 days. Mike and Paul slept over. We made a kickass movie, Paul should be putting it online soon...right Paul!?  August 4th - I recorded some funny stuff of me and my sister dead smack in the morning way before Paul and Mike woke up. When everyone woke up, we finished making the movie, Heaton went home without telling us...well he told Paul but not me because I was doing Jackass stunts (crashing into the curb on my scooter and flipping over and smashing my head on the floor) in front of cars down the block to make cars stop and ask if I needed help. Then Paul and I got Ricky to come over and surprise Matt. It worked successfully with Matt confusedly saying "You're home?!" Not any where near reaction as mine...I slapped my face a million times and screamed. Ok, so back to surprising Matt...jesus I almost forgot how to spell surprise. So, Matt could only stay for like an hour, then he had to go to soccer. Then Paul and I hung out with Erin and Courtney at the beach. Erin sat on Paul and Erin started elevated...hmmm I wonder why? Paul put a happy face on my back with sun tan lotion but Erin smudged it all in an hour later! ERIN!!! Haha, ya then Paul and I ate my Dad's kick ass Chili...(Paul and I were beafing up the night) and we slept at Matt's. It was crazy, Matt's older brother Tom had his friend Bryan sleep over. At first it sucked because we had to watch skateboarding movies but then it was great because we watched the Family Guy Season 1 and 2 DVD. Then Paul, Bryan and I couldn't fall asleep until 4. Paul kept saying random words that made Bryan and I crack up. Especially Grandpa Benson or something.   August 5th - We all took a jog...well Thomas, PJ (Baby Kaiser or as Paul says "Germy") and Bryan rode bikes. We all went to 711. Then we got back to Matt's and my back like ripped. Paul kept showing Matt and I Stacy's Mom video from Fountain of Wayne and claiming it the best video ever...so I showed him Zebrahead's Playmate of The Year video. I remember seeing FoW in concert a long time ago with my cousin as an intro to The Smashing Pumpkins. Paul had showed this video to me from the first day he got home. Anyways, my back hurt alot, ruined my day. We all went home. Matt got in big trouble for something that doesn't make any sense or have any relevance to Matt. I feel you Matt, I feel you. I had a fight with my whole family at night over dumb 13 Ghosts about how the guy jumped LONG, not HIGH. I was right, they were wrong. Their so dumb. Oh well...everything's cool now...well now it is the night of the 6th.  August 6th - My back felt the same in the morning but out of nowhere it healed instantly while chatting on the computer. I listened to a shitload of music today. Mowed the lawn without my parents having to tell me. I mowed before they came home and I wore a gas mask for giggles. Tehe...they were all proud of me. Then I beat Splinter Cell before I had to return it. I took a bike ride, drummed a bit, went to Carvel, returned Splinter Cell, went to Baskin Robbins for my sister's ice cream, came home. And that's it. I got a Carvel shake, but their not as good as they used to be. Depressing how teens can't make anything good. We suck haha. Maybe it's just us lazy American teens. At Baskin Robbins my dad parked in the back alley, so I hid under the car seat to hide from any wankstas, god I hate this generation. You can't trust anyone. )= Ah shut up Tom.
