I can bet you Kobe is pissed and is gonna own it up next year.  From what I understand the Mavs play the Spurs tonight.  I'm going to bet on the Spurs because I think the Mavs are a lot like the Lakers.  We'll see how that one goes.  Other than that I really don't have much to say.  I've been bored mostly lately.  No basketball, or anything just off-season lifting and stuff.  School sucks as usual.  Oh well.  Peace.   Listening to: Beethoven - "Presto Agitato"
