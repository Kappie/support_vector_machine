The guide led us around the floor, pointing out the various machines  explaining their purposes. Apparently, ever since the rolling brownouts 2 years ago, the factory has had backup power generation for all critical systems. 
  
In other news, the 15-inch Powerbook I ordered last week has finally shipped :-)
