Wait, no one reads it, my bad. Well, if you happen upon my own little world, go to this one instead -  urlLink Monkey blog  because it is so much cooler. Probably the only blog I ever really read on a daily basis. So, back to me. No, I'm not being all vain and stuff, it's my blog, it has to be about me, I have the right to make it about me. With that settled, back to what I was on about. Karchan is boring, so is Hollow. RL ain't too hot. I'm moving, a nice house over in Upper Milford. I'll be going to East Penn, I know some kids that go there so it won't be that weird. I'll have my own room and stuff, but we're not moving there until August 27th. Right now I'm pretty much helping everyday to keep this house looking real good, so when people want to look at it everything is decent. Mowed the lawn earlier and weedwacked. You know the problem with East Penn, I'm friends with this one kid, but I hate his other friends. I guess now I'll have to like them. Funny story, I was talking to this girl that I know likes me, and she asked me to the movies. I don't feel the same way about her, but I didn't want to say no, I'm not that mean. I sorta just danced around the issue, got on to other subjects. I know, loyal reader, you probably hate me now. I'm not that mean of a guy, really. 867-5309. Call it.
