Perhaps he smelled alcohol on my breath for the last 2 weeks of class, figured that I didn't care about contributing to class discussion unless absolutely imparative, or perhaps it's because I didn't follow directions on a few poems.  That being said, it should also be noted that I turned in at least 3 extra assignments than were necessary and that my comments were of the highest quality I could muster while dealing with the dog shit of the others in the class.  Whatever.  I've graduated with a 3.79 and that's pretty good, honors or no honors    PS I've decided that trying to download and convert Wilco concerts is too much a pain in the ass and takes up the precious little memory I have left
