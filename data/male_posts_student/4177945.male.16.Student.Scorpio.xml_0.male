Hmm there was suppose to be a  seminar  that day after school.. but unfortunately one of the speakers of the seminar was sick.. so it was cancelled.. most of us was picked to help during the seminars as  ushers,photographers or mcs .. when news was passed that it was cancel,we were so pissed off esp those who had already wore formal clothes to school for the seminar.. so they feel kinda stupid wearing it for nothing.. a good thing i was clever enough to come to school in outside clothes instead of wearing my formal clothes straight from home.. so i wasnt affected that much just that i was so eager to wear the blazer but in the end i was disappointed.. hmm after that me  Joan Peishi Angeline junxiong  Amy  Jane Beeleng and Joanne  went to  Junction 8 .. we all went to the Food Junction first as they were hungry..  me n Junxiong  did not eat as we had ate in school.. after that  Terissa  meet us there..  Amy's  middle finger had a cut.. so i went to buy  Pooh plasters at Watson .. hope she felt betta as she like Pooh.. haha..  Jane   and Peishi  went off first as the rest of us accompany  Terissa  to  Mos burger  coz she had not eaten the whole day.. after that we wasted lots of time at there.. we could not decide where we wanna go.. In the end we decided to go to  Little Guilin .. haha.. of all places..  Joanne Beeleng and Joan  did not follow us as they were busy.. So only left  Terissa Angeline   Amy   Jun xiong and me .. haha cant believe they bought  Vodka  to drink during daylight.. Crazy.. Coz of that also  Amy  got hurt as she tried to open the bottle cap of  Junxiong's  drink.. 3 of her fingers on her left hand was cut..i felt like  razorblades  pierce through my heart the moment she was cut.. we quickly help her wash her wound.. fortunately i bought those  Pooh plasters  earlier on.. so 3 of her fingers had plasters on.. haha so cute..after that we had a fun and relaxing time there..had lots of laughter.. we saw a  couple making out  there like noones business.. also saw  a guy  so enthusiastic trying to fish there.. and we made lots of  jokes about the lake and the tortoises .. hahaha.. We also made a name for our group.. we call ourselves 'The GLG sickos'.. muahaha.. perfect name for all of us who are sickos..End of the day , we had a great time there.. Lots of interaction.. we went off at 7pm.. i went straight home.. i slept that day while worrying about her fingers.. Seeing her hurt is like  Razorblades  cutting me up...
