So i realized that i haven't really done anything productive this summer...this came to my attention when my father asked why i don't have friends or a boyfriend..haha...he really needs to get over that boyfriend thing, i'm intent on staying with  amanda  for as long as humanly possible :) i also just realized that i totally forgot to do my video documentary of this summer, starting with me speaking at graduation and proceeding to get wasted that night and then jumping into college creek while wearing my cap and gown.....how could i have forgotten such a monumental moment in my life? haha. So my UVA departure is nearing, I can't wait until i am away from bitch and my father for a while..maybe we'll start to like each other when we're all away from each other for a while...at least my dad won't be around to tell me i can't go see my significant other (i felt like using a different word there haha) i got a brilliant idea to make soy milk ice cream and market it to the lactose intolerant population of the world, but maybe soy milk ice cream already exists...if it does i'd probably be a dumbass and put whipped cream on it anyways, thus defeating the purpose of soymilk ice cream. i envy people that can freely enjoy milk without the devestating effects of being lactose intolerant. I would like to eat ice cream for just one day in my life without throwing up; i'd probably eat like 6 gallons of it and throw up anyway haha...i think that's enough of my random as hell thoughts for now, although i could go on forever, but i'll wait until i write my bestselling book, Spilling the Beans, for that haha
