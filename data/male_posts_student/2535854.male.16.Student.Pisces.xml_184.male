I met Chaman at MPH and we went by Irish and met Loong,Ryan,Jin Yip, U-Waye,Izwan and a bunch of my old seniors were there...we watched Ganesh and Adrian play foosball...damn mad dickhead that Ganesh..shot so fucking hard til the ball flew outside and landed on the road...crazy..haha...Anyway watched Ryan and Loong play pool...and I played against Chaman..yikes..I ahte hate British pool tables...so sucky..and when I hit all my nice shots, no1 looked...when I messed up,everyone was laughing and watching.Bastards. Anyway we were stuck there since Modesto`s had people still occupying the damn tables. Harlots.  Well then the show had some dances and fashions shows obviously...the dance were pretty good and stuff..buncha nIgGa`s getting high next to us...'Mc`diver' as Ryan calls him, was there as usuall looking like stoned fuck. By the way... 'Mc`diver' is this guy in Bangsar whos like either drunk often and crap...Haha..Interesting characters that we have here in Bangsar...anyway they screened snippets of Putri Gunung Ledang...looks interesting...and the sound at the show was powerful..almost as rumb-blAiY as New Year`s Eve 2001 commin into 2002....  Anyway I went home at midnight...not much..just there for the fun of it...they had free Sprite Ice there so didn`t need to spend cas at Coffee Bean of something...And also cause mom let me out :p ...So why waste the oppurtunity? Anyway I was online from 12:30 am - 3:30 am...nothin g almost nothing happening..sigh...sad.Exams next week and other things are on my mind so can`t really study..yikes..Next week? oh dear the 9th of August that is..
