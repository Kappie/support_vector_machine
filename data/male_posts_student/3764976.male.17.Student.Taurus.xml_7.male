Yes, that's 17+ years of poop experience and I just took the biggest of them all.   The new Senses Fail record that will be coming out soon is just what I expected: good, pounding dark music, screaming, and some oddly simple yet catchy lyrics. Some people don't like it, but I really am getting into it. Dan Trapp is a really good drummer for only being 17. He's done his practicing obviously to play in a band like that.   The band front is just what it has been, working on a new one. Possibly might even be using an old name and a former bandmate too for this one. We will be playing Hardcore too, because, to be frank, I'm sick of playing pop-punk for right now. I want to play music that moves me emotionally, and doesn't just make me smile for the time being. I really am getting into that and more emo right now.   One band that I've been into since they came out on Drive-Thru Records is The Early November. They are really musically talented and can really get a crowd feeling the music deeply. I heard a few songs from Matchbook Romance and I like them a lot too. The drumming is graet. Avenged Sevenfold is a hardcore band that really caught my attention, mainly because of the drumming, but the guitar work is really cool too. Adelphi is a new DTR band and I like what I've heard from them too.   I recommend everyone listening to as many of these bands as you can get your hands on. What's the worst that can happen? You might end up liking them. I almost forgot hellogoodbye. They're an innovative band. I can't even describe them, just listen and learn.   Oddly enough, I've been in a good mood lately. I really do not know as to why I have been. The other stuff comes and goes still, but not nearly as much as it had been. I was a wreck for a couple of weeks there. I seem to begin to think about things late at night that I really shouldn't be thinking about and it keeps me awake. Then I get a real panicky feeling, like whatever I want to tell someone or do simply cannot wait. I'm more worried about the things that probably won't happen instead of the things that do happen. See, I'm usually what many call a "procrastinator" and I put things off until there is nothing I can do about it, then I try my hardest to do something and I fail.   I also make snap judgements and decisions without thinking about them. I can remember one time that a girl wanted to go out with me and I automadically said no, like it was a planned response. I went home that night and realized I had made a huge mistake, and tried to take back what I said. I really did want to go out with her. She said that I was an ass and, in conclusion, I was fucked over by my own actions. God I am such a loser. If you need proof of this, look at how large this post is. I am a douchbag. Well, a cuddly, lovable douchbag, but one nontheless.
