IF people say, "Since you broke your arm, you cannot play anymore. Well, we are sad too". Hang on, i disagree with that. I will come to that later.  Well umm... we got the shortest day in history. We had our maths test and game over. Quite an easy piece of work with questions like: What is 4a + a - 5b + 3b. Well, i guess it's primary school stuff... slept after 10 minutes.  Went home and slammed guitar and play com. A guy called Jinba came to my house to play. he missed all my fu*k shots in my games. nvm.  Went to eat in canteen. Menu was curry rice.   We later went to the city hall for my visa renewal. That was the FILTHIEST building i seen in some years, and it was a  city hall .   ...  Well, we went out. I went to the batting centre along with dad. Managed to hit some balls. also played the arcade games over there. what a boring waste of time i realise, and money, not to forget. I hit those 110km/h balls hard. then i swung my bat and felt it was alright. I went to the softball machine and noticed one card still had credit. BleAk, took it and set it to 100km/h. Not bad, but got some air balls and can feel the wind. lolzy  okie, went to  BOOK OFF  and well, read  MAJOR  and it gave me the incredulous motivation to spur me on. I read almost about 8 volumes and I realised how wonderful the fighting spirit of the little kiddos play baseball in Japan. This isn't the realm where books dominate. Brains are in fact a worthless organ in studies but a precious computer chip in the game. Strategic thinking acts as a wonderful web to cling everybody in the pitch together.   The protagonist,  Gorou Honda  was an arrogant but miraculous player during his primary school times. He was a pitcher and pitched wonderful balls that travel at 110km/h. Imagine that talent on that pitch. However, his route to succes is taunted by his thought of  one man show . he later learnt how to work with each other in his club  Mifune Little and finally, they beat the best primary school team in Japan,  Yokohama Little . His strong rivalry with  Toshiya Satou  urges him to work harder and harder if not he will catch him up. Satou was a typical nerd in the block but Gorou helped him to undersatnd the interesting game. He then became the ace Yokohama Little. Imagine the  ACE  of  Yokohama Little .  Their rivalry was not stopped even in their Secondary schooling. As a result of their clash, Gorou damaged his shoulder which is essential for the pitcher. Depressed, he could not over come his sadness and had to join the soccer team. However, his stepfather encouraged him to be a Southpaw. "...Even if the result wouldn't be as marvellous as your right hand, i am sure you wouldn't want to leave the mount at such a young age. Sure, if you really can't continue, you can still be the world's best slugger"  By transferring to East Mifune, he met his old friends who were in Mifune little. The center fielder had his dream of being a J-leaguer and didn't pursue his baseball career. The only female outfielder,  Kaoru Shimizu  was in the softball club and with the foundations set up by her early baseball days, she then became the captain of East Mifune's softball captain. That leaves only one boy,   Daisuke Komori , who was yet another simple minded boy. He was the catcher for Gorou but after their secondary days, they had to bid each other farewell as they go for their dream high school. After Toshiya and Gorou's clash in the finals, Gorou emerged champion and the top high school wanted to enrol him. However, they had to go through a gruelsome test. Their first test was to run around the track as many arounds as possible and the first person who laps the guy lagging behind will be disqualified. The mass number of people will be eliminated to only 5 people.  Gorou, Daisuke and Toshiya managed to pass the first round. The second round was to complete a thousand squats which again eliminated much people. Toshiya and Gorou began to feel the real pain of the tests. Daisuke, with much difficulty, finished it too.  The third test was nothing related to physicals. it was to eat 5 lunches from lunch boxes within 30 minutes. Gorou finished it first. Toshiya came in second. Daisuke wanted to give up. However, he managed to finish it in the last minute. His fighting spirit deserves a round of applause.  The fourth test was to play Penalty Kick. Hang on, not with the soccer ball but with BASEBALL. The goalkeeper will use  no gloves . Gorou booted the person he faced. the second pair was the pair that nobody will expect: Daisuke and Toshiya. At first, their jaws dropped wide open. However, Gorou asked them to give out their best. Toshiya turn out to be the better. After an emotional farewell with Daisuke, Gorou and Toshiya were in for the final test, along with 20 people  With 20 people, Gorou and Toshiya splitted up to form 4 groups. They were expected to play baseball with only 5 people. Gorou and Toshiya formed an invincible pair but Toshiya insisted Gorou to be Center fielder. He had no choice but to let another normal player to pitch. After conceding 2 points, Toshiya ordered Gorou to be shortstop. However, Gorou was not happy but agreed. Upon reading the batter's swing, Gorou began to move to various places people would not expect and caught all the grounders. People were amazed by his analytical ability. Toshiya completed the art with a homerun to help them into the finals.  The finals was against another perfect combo. The pitcher and the catcher were as good as Gorou and Toshiya. However, this time, the pitcher on Gorou's team was unfortunately hit by the ball and injured his arm. Gorou's dream finally came true. He went to the mount and pitched his super fast pitches and struck the pitcher off. Toshiya again touched up the victory by a Homerun at the last innning.  Gorou, Toshiya and their team were in the High school. however, they still had to go through the test that everybody, not just the baseball club, but the whole Japan must take: The enrolment test. Gorou couldn't cope and wanted to quite. However, his stepmother's words were enough even for the teenager to start his mugging nerves working.  "Are you going to lose to books? I know you don't like losing"  Gorou managed to get the hang of the books, thanks to Toshiya. He also became more serious in his work and during lesson time. Although he did not do very well, he managed to get in.  I also want to be like Gorou. I am no different from him. I go to the batting centre often. SheEz. I am not an ordinary boy. I am from ACSi and i went before the best baseball high school in Japan. I will be a southpaw too if i get injured. I will be the best slugger. I won't lose. I am Matthew Ge.
