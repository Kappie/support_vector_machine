So I went down the hall, took a right, then a left and wound up in a room that looked like a hockey changing room (with that black plastic stuff on the bottom too). There was only a few people who were there before me. After awhile more and more people came in and then our teacher finally walked in and started talking. I don't remember what he said, but I doubt it was that important. Then he either opened this door or they just appeared, but I saw all these monitor lizards. Then he opened a door that lead outside. Then after about 2 more minutes of the teacher talking, one of the lizards went outside. Everyone, including the teacher, just stared at me. I guess I was the one who was going to have to get it. So I went out the same door, and found the lizard just sitting about 10 feet away from me. I started approaching it, then it ran up and tried to attack me. Well I think that, because it didn't' really bite anywhere bad, it was going for my neck, but not viciously or aiming to kill. At least that's what I think. Then our teacher came out and got the lizard off of me. Then slowly the rest of the class emerged with their lizards on leashes. But it was weird, 1) I was the only one without a leash on my lizard (was I special?) and 2) they attached the leases backwards. The loop that you're supposed to hold was around the lizard's neck and the student was holding the metal clip. I guess that since there was no collar, they had to attach it that way. Well now we're in the schools back field. I think it was spring because there was still snow out there, but it was melting and the air was quite warm. I don't think the snow bothered the lizards. So I followed my lizard around without a leash. He took me to the side of the field, where there was a ravine and a deep creek running through it. My lizard decided to jump into the creek, regardless if the ravine walls were too steep. So I tried to jump into the ravine and land on a little part beside the river to get the lizard. I realized that I screwed myself. The walls were too steep and muddy for me to get back up. I turned my back to the river, jumped up and tried to grasp something to pull me up. I don't know how (well I do, dreams don't have to make sense) but I saw my lizard staring me in the face. He hissed at me like he was planning that kind of fighting or play game. I called our teacher for some help, he restrained the lizard and helped me out. Then he finally gave me a leash, but I found it quite awkward to hold and keep it from slipping out of my hands.  In my short time in the ravine I decided that I had to name my lizard. I named him JoJo. So without much time, JoJo pulled on the leash and with a bit of a stuggle on my part, he got away and headed for the part of the creek that was level with the field. There was a group of kids near the edge and as a walked closer, I found out their lizards were digging themselves into the creek-bed. Of course JoJo decided to join in. I let him go in a bit but then, with quite a bit of struggle, I tried to pull him out. He pulled harder inwards, the leash slipped and somehow he climbed out of a hole in the field. I grabbed the leash and led him around the perimeter of the field with the teacher. I'm pretty sure we talked, but I forget what it was about. So we reached the other end of the field, which was a bit darker from the clouds and I found out we had, well used to have, a hockey rink in the snow. After walking the perimeter we headed back into the school and into the same room. I let JoJo run around the room off leash, but he just sat there. After awhile a couple more people came in. Then JoJo went into the hallway. He started "attacking" this garbage can that was on wheels. The teacher started laughing and told me to come and see this. JoJo bit onto one of the wheels and was pulling the can around the hallway. It was quite funny, but then I had to go get him, then the dream ended.
