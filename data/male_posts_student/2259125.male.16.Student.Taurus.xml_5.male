It was published in April, obviously during the school year. I am no longer on the newspaper staff, thank God. I'm just glad that I got the article out there for people to read and think about. A lot of the stuff under this is stuff I wanted to write in that article but knew the editor would never let it be published.)  I have been thinking about this for a while now, and it is time for me to go off. I have a friend (and yes, for future reference, we are actually very good friends, although it is beyond me how that came about because we are so different in what we believe) who is "homosexual." We argue about this issue frequently. He sometimes says that "God is an invention of people in power to keep the people they wanted to control in check." He tells me this almost as often as he tells me that the only reason I think "homosexuality" is wrong is because I have been told that by my parents who were told that by their parents who were told that by  their  parents, and so on and so forth until you get to some silly, old-fashioned, close-minded priest* somewhere who had somehow gotten the idea in his head that oh my goodness, "HOMOSEXUALITY" IS A SIN. Well, it is, if you take the Bible at face value, which you should. (Read Genesis 2:24 to see what God says a family should consist of and Romans 1:26-27 to see where God says that "homosexuality" is not natural.) But my friend doesn't like hearing that someone out there isn't afraid to disagree with him.   The reason I put the word "homosexual" in quotes is because personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as "homosexuality." There are no "homosexuals." This is because "homosexuality" is NOT something you are "born with" and it's not something you can't change. Sexual orientation isn't determined by your genes or an unbalance of chemicals or   The whole idea of more than one sexual orientation in the first place is something that was created by man to justify their actions. Different people have different stumbling blocks - some lie to get out of whatever trouble they've gotten into, some are kleptomaniacs, some succumb to the temptation to look at or watch pornography, and some gravitate towards members of their own gender on a romantic level and say "it's natural."  A "homosexual" is (and this will sound harsh) just another word for someone who is living completely in sin... much like a drug addict or even a murderer. Now don't get me wrong, I am in NO WAY calling people living "homosexual" lifestyles druggies or murderers. There are definitely some relatively "good" people who call themselves "homosexuals", I can attest to that. As many times as my friend who is "homosexual" threatens to run me or other people who occasionally irritate him over in the parking lot with his car, I know he won't. But murderers and druggies can change the way they are living their lives in the same way that anyone else can stop giving into the sinful nature of their humanity. I'm no better than anyone who says they are "homosexual". The only difference is that I have given my life to Jesus Christ, and through him I am rescued from any sinful desires I may have... and believe me, just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's any easier to resist them. But at least I can know for sure that God will provide a way to escape the temptations so that I can stand up under them. (1 Cor. 10:13) People who don't have that relationship don't have the ability to stop living in sin and are going to try their very best to convince everyone that their favorite kind of sin is a perfectly normal thing.   "Homosexual" activists constantly argue that "if God says we should love one another, then why don't you? God loves me the way I am, he made me this way!" First of all, yes. God loves you. God loves you so much that he gave his only Son to die for you. Don't ask me why, we're really special to him for some reason that I will never fully understand. But think of it this way. Your parents love you, right? But if they find out you're shooting heroin in your closet, they aren't going to be too happy. If they're good parents, they're going to try and get you into rehab and to get you to kick the habit. It's sort of like that with God. He loves you more than anything, and yeah, he will take you as you are if you're willing to come to him and worship him, but he doesn't want you to keep living in sin. Jesus didn't die on the cross so you can say "wheeee, God loves me, now I'm going to do whatever I want because it's the way I am." Yeah, it's the way you are, but you DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY, and if you don't want to change then you haven't really understood what it means to be a Christian. Jesus died on the cross so that you can have a way to escape your sin nature. He doesn't WANT you to keep living in sin. And he clearly defines what sin is in the Bible, so you can't get away with anything. He's going to forgive you if you ask him to, but if you just go and do whatever you want because you know you'll be forgiven, you are abusing his amazing grace. If you truly and honestly love the Lord, you will strive to obey him and please him. People who are not truly walking with the Lord should not be able to get away with saying "God loves me the way I am." God loves you the way he created you, and he created you to worship and love him. If you're not doing that, you are instead dishonoring God's intentions for your body. What "homosexuals" do is not what God intended for them, therefore the argument that "God loves them the way they are" does not apply.   Because some "homosexuals" are Christians who have fallen for the worldly lie that says they are "born that way," the rest of the "homosexual" community believes oh, well THOSE must be the real Christians, because they love us for who we are. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. The truth is so rarely heard anymore and frankly, I'm tired of being the only one defending what the  real  real Christians believe to my "homosexual" friend. We got in an argument during my science class one day and we were practically screaming at each other by the end of it, and all the other Christians in the room that I knew were listening were just sitting idly by, watching and listening. Maybe they thought I could handle it, but still, some support would have been nice. Or maybe they were afraid he was going to cuss them out, which could very well have happened. It happened to me practically every day. The world has been trying to get Christians to shut up for forever. There is always someone out there who is going to throw everything they've got at you. Get over it. It comes with the territory (John 15:17-19). There are worse things than being ridiculed for believing in God. Like, all your friends going to hell, for example. Keep that in mind.   *I'm not Catholic, but some of my ancestors could very well have been. My dad has researched our family tree for as long as I can remember, it's sort of a hobby. We're not Mormon either and he's not looking for names to baptize into the church. I think we had some Mormon ancestors though. This has been your useless Sarah trivia of the day.
