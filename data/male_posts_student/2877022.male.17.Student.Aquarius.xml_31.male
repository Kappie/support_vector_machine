PHYSICS and CHEMISTRY. how very interesting. well basically today was slack just that special mention goes to chemistry prac where i supposedly 'bossed' around the class to their respective groups. oih la i am chemistry rep and if you people don't get there on time i am the one in trouble la. o_0 silly shu jun. nvm i forgive my mean girl x) okay so anyway for chemistry prac my group went to CM44 which happened to be where s5I was at. well basically chemistry prac was fun for us because, we finished earlier than the class there because we cheated. so we spent half the time 'gossiping' and trying to make the teacher let us off early. well we succeeded la but not before we sat through 45 mins worth of going through the entire experiment calculations. heh then mindy, sj and i sat at one corner and ostracised elsa because she was MEAN to mindy! hahah we basically acted like stupid kids till we were let off. i think we are one crazy but united class man. props to us ;) oh and special mention goes to mindy leow for filling up her burette with HCl till it overflowed from her burette onto my chair and shoes simply because she just placed the filter funnel on top of the opening without leaving a gap in between to let it go down faster. her look on her face was h i l a r i o u s. but nvm we still love our canoe babe for doing these kinda funny things don't we? oh and qian jin!! we will miss you!! come back soon! preferrably with lotsa chocolates and goodies x)
