But... it was fun, and the pain is temporary. Yay.  I think i did a good explanation of this one scene in the concert... although I don't remember where I did it... church or school... I was talking about how, after the Complex song, the 3 blue men come out with blue welders masks, and they take em off and "repair the damage," and it seemed a good way to explain it in real life. I dunno.  I'm gonna goto bed now. I have another useless day of benchmarking and web mastering to look forward to.  BlueBlueborrito IMed me and made me remember that I still want to make a signature for the Blue Man Message Boards. I guess I'll brainstorm possibilities in the morning/at school.
