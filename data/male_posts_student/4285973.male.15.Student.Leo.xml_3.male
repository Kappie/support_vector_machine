Bush      Any questions?  Still not convinced? Let's have a look at a few highlights of each candidate...   John Kerry:  A.) Lied about being in Cambodia on Christmas Day... so much for being "seared" into his memory B.) Is so afraid he is going to lose this election that he is working to prevent an independent Ralph Nader from getting on the ballot. If he doesn't want the constitution held up, where any man should be able to run, do you want him as your next President? C.) Flip-flops on most issues. The list is endless folks...   Ralph Nader:  A.) Not a Democrat and not a Republican...where does that leave him ? B.) Second best choice- if for some unconceivable reason you can't vote for Bush, then vote Nader (unless of course you live in a state that the Democrats have succeeded in denying Mr. Nader basic constitutional rights...then don't vote for anyone)   George W. Bush:  A.) Has tracked down and fought a large majority of the terrorists responsible for MURDERING thousands of Americans on September 11th. B.) Increased government funding to schools so we can help improve future generations of Americans. C.) Increased our military so that we can fight those who wish to threaten our nation. This list also continues with hundreds more reasons a vote for Bush is a vote for America.  So... let me sum this up for you in one sentence:     ON ELECTION DAY, LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD WHEN YOU VOTE GEORGE W. BUSH BACK INTO OFFICE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF STONG LEADERSHIP!
