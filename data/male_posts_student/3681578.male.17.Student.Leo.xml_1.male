I have an early first class tomorrow so I might not post later...I have to get enough sleep so I can wake up early (without being grumpy)...and eventually commute to ateneo, reaching CTC by 7:15 am with just enough time to drop by gonzaga for a drink...   Come to think of it...I'm somewhat bored of having to go through the same process of commuting everyday...well, not as bored as I can be...mainly because I am only required to go early on Mondays and Tuesdays (I have 7:30 classes)...the rest? oh, Wednesday is 9:30, Thursday is 10:30 and Friday (with Intac) is 8:30...not much pressure but I usually arrive early at school and just do my homework at the library, I'm less distracted by temptations there unlike in home where there is pc that needs to be opened and a blog entry that needs to be posted...   Hmmm...the library is now somewhat a place of respite for me...there is now a "Physics Block" spot in the lib where we usually stay when we go inside the lib...wala lang...   And there's something else that is boggling me...well, not really boggle...   well...its just how people (my riscianthirdbatch people) are doing? are they fine? ok? wala lang...  btw, I do hope their ok...  I still haven't finished the readings for Hulagpos...but at least I have braced myself for the worst in my english and literature classes...  and I'm still thinking about Intac...like what is happening there? wala lang...I have this very shrewd idea, we will be asked to memorize the blue babble cheers and the alma mater song (ito parang mas relevant) and then our test will be fill in the blanks (or worse...write the cheers and/or lyrics)...  and for practicum, we are required to yell with the crowd in a UAAP game...hehehe...lol...  anyway...I'll try to post tomorrow na lang!   mwah!
