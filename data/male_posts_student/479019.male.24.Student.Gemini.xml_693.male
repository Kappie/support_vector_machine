I think this one benefited from Tyrese's charisma. He was just a really cool character in the movie. If they make another movie, he's gotta be in it.  I think I'm gonna go have some soup, before getting productive.  Should I read some Derrida, Durkheim, or something else from another course? Or should I write?  I should do more artwork for this site and the Traffic website maybe after I get some real work done.  Now playing some  Weakerthans ... who's name sounds like Wheat Thins... but yea, "Our Retired Explorer (Dines with Michel Foucault in Paris 1971)" is a quirky song.  Oh you're so very sweet Thank you for the flowers and the book by Derrida But I must be getting back to Dear Antartica....  ***
