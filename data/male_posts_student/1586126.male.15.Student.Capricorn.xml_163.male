"oh i heard that smoking makes you forguet your problems" it doesnt. it only delays it a bit and then fucks up your health. and guess what? youre a fucking sissy piece of shit if you cant even control your own emotions. ooooh im so tense i need a cigar. you lame piece of degenerative crap.    second, everyone just acts like a total asshole. im getting bored of you all trying to act to some stupid rule of society, and deep inside i know that none of you are like that. stupid two faces, bunch of motherfuckers. heres a little secret of my own: I hate you all. im just waiting for the day when you will die so that i can live my life happpily ever after without having to worry about your stupid prejudices. sick of your dirty looks, of your inching away, ASSHOLES.    so yeah, the world is going downhill and im staying on top of it to watch it fall. maybe its just for the kicks, i dont know, but i surely dont wanna be part of this thing you call "being cool". jesus.
