Very simply, my bed broke. Nigel sat on it.  It’s kinda nice being on the floor. It gives a new perspective of my most familiar surroundings. It’s like given the chance to have a fresh view on something we take for granted.  For example, I have a few glow-in-the-dark stars pasted on the ceiling of my room. They are centered around the light it my room so that they would get maximum exposure to the light when it is on. But since my bed is in one corner of my room, I don’t really get to appreciate them. There are not that many of them. But now…my mattress is in the center of the room and when the lights go off, I find myself directly under them.   Lying there, I find that it no longer matters that there are only a few of them. It is enough to shine like beacons out of the darkness, to show that I am not alone in this big murky world, to pour out on me the light that was poured out on them until they fade away, having shared with me all the light that they had.  It makes me wonder about the time I gave a few bags of these stars away. I had brought them back from far away. I wonder if they where used as attended or if they were set aside in a dark drawer, never to see and share the light.  A gift of stars is a wonderful thing. Go out and lie on a grass patch, somewhere away from the city lights and just stare at them. Imagine the stars in the sky as gifts, made millions of years ago, millions of light years away, just for you in that one instant. How long has the Light traveled to reach our eyes. And ponder on the stars themselves, as big or bigger than our Sun, yet burning themselves away to shine for us. Just a fraction of the glory of the One that made them for us.  This holiday season, go out and receive the gift that was given from the beginning of Time and so may it remind you of the Gift that was given to you 2000 years ago, born under the sign of a star.  Happy holidays   >
