Theres about 35 or something of them, and thats all you'll be able to see about my life this week due to the fact that I have to do some photo work for another website.  I actually ditched Sea World because it was lame as hell!  I went to this place called Belmont Park and rode the Giant Dipper.  It was pretty damn good.  It was like built in 1925 or something.  Anyways after that I went to Knott's and rode some coasters and crap, took a few pictures of things there too.  Anyways I'm hungry as hell right now.  So I'm going to eat some food.  Ta.
