Note to self: stop. I am hoping to get my lip ierced soon. I researched it. Sounds a bit yucky. If there's a will there's a way though. HAHA.   If people have a problem with piercing: piss off, I don't wnat to hear it on my comment thing. Mood has currently changed. I am now enraged. I love everyone currently.   I just went to town and got some rather nice cords. Rather splendid infact. Gooooo cords.
