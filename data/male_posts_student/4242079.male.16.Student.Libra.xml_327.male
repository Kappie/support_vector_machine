To scrape knees. Raw. As you fail. Fall. Fail. Fall.  I didn't know that wine could sour And this bread has long been stale. From the outside looking in. I can see the strings. I can hear.  You and Dayven. Have worlds in common. Imagine. They can make themselves feel anything. It's all in your head. Hoping for something else.  I've taken a few more days. We've broken up. Like radios through snow. Ears frostbitten through snow. Raw. Raw. White.  So bring your reward. A bag full of toys. They'll behave for you. They'll be. Have. Give. For you.  It's the coal that keeps us warm.
