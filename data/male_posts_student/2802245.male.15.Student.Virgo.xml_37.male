I'll just have to sit there going "awww" while he points and laughs. great! :( Damn them ceapo canadian currency. I wish I could buy a Geforce 6800 Ultra to get back my revenge, but it is around Â£400 out my reach at the moment, so I think that will be no, somehow.  Just discovered the profile thingy. I entered my birthday correctly, but it says my star sign is virgo, while my true star sign is libra. "Erm, blogger, sort it out!" I thought. Then as i thought about it, i realised something.  The date is month/day/year across the pond, not day/month/year over here . I changed it, and it came up with Libra correctly. tsk, trust them americans!  The new colour scheme is waaay better, if anyone else agrees. But no one probably reads this so oh well :/ Apparently, Simon might start blogging. This could let onto a big blog if simon bothers his ass and posts regularly...  tribute to l33tn3ss  Jamie
