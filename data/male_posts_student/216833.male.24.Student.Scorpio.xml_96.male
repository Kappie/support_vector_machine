Went to bed early.  On Saturday morning, woke up around 9:30am or maybe t was later. After mimi went to work I drove up to school, but they wouldn't let me work - they said my time had expired and I was supposed to meet with one of the directors. He stood me up. So I called Alex, he was asleep. I went home and got on my computer and talked to Kevin from Shreveport. He convinced me to come out to veggie garden at 2pm to eat and hang out. I had no money( I do but my account is frozen until I get my money back and my rent paid) but Nick hooked me up and now I owe him lunch. I got home around 3:45 and Brian called. He came over and hung out for a while. mimi came home around 5pm and we just sat around. We were all waiting to go over to Alex's casa and hang out. Left my house around 7pm - stopped at sonic and got a soda with quarters that I fished out of the bottom of the Mortal Kombat game.  Got to Alex's house and looked at the wedding pictures. They are awesome - THANKS ALEX! I was super stoked out all that - means alot to me to have a friend like him. We watched Brian play video games, played some 2 player Tony Hawk while mimi fell asleep. After all that - it was around 11 and everyone was asking me when Nick was going to call - so we decided to watch one of the many great DVDs that Eric and Alex have. We watched Pi - that was a kick ass movie. It made you think for sure.   I wanted to go dig for books behind the Half Price Books - it was 1am - mimi was tired.  Sunday was ok - we went to Denny's for breakfast and it was packed - not pleasent. I played some GTA3 until about noon and got ready to go to Sommer Shockley graduation. We were there for a while, after that mimi had to go to work for a few hours and when she got home, I had dinner ready for her and we watched the simpsons and some of the basketball game. Damn Lakers!   Watched 'The Seige' on TV last night. That was kinda weird to watch after Sept.11th.
