Yesterday I went to the mall with Brittney, James, Miguel, and Daniel. Those guys crack me up! I got a shirt and a keychain that both explain a lot. I also got my ticket for  Warped Tour  yesterday. Which means I need to find a ride. Well, I might have a ride but I'm not so sure Chante would be the nicest person to me. She's riding with Tim and so is Brittney. Tim thought I wasn't going so he offered his friend Joe a ride, but Joe might not go. If Joe doesn't go, then I'm going with them.  I don't know if I can take anymore of Chantes bullshit. First, she posted a blog about me and Brittney and how we start drama and deleted us off of her friends. Brittney flipped out and wrote her a long note telling her that  WE  (me  AND  Brittney) were just joking around with her. Then Chante, being the moron that she is, added Brittney as a friend again and not me! To top it off, she apologizes by saying "SORRY DUDE S " but blocks me as a person! That's just messed up! Now she expects me to beg her for forgiveness! I don't need that or her! EWWW! Now I'm all angry again!
