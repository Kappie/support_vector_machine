It looks more like a Dream Team. Alongwith the NY Yankees,the LA Lakers symbolise the enduring Sporting Legacy of Wonderful Players,Loyal fans  unlimited fame.                      The Western Conference Winners have for the last few Years been the winners of NBA Title too ( The Western Teams are so very superior to the East that the Semi-final loser in the West can beat the best East Team !).So the Shaq-Kobe Domination continues in-spite of On-field Rivalry  off-field Legal Battles(Kobe).
