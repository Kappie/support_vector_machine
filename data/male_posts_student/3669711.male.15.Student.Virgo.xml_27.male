Great game, very addictive, i'll tell you about it.      This game was developed by Gravity Corp. in about 2002.  Its realitivily simple to get in to, point and click adventure, killing things and grabbing items and leveling your character up.  It uses 3D background models and 2D character and enemy models.  Quite interesting and beautiful when you look at it.  And on top of all that, the music and sfx are all excellent too!      There are about 19 jobs you can be, starting out by being a novice, progressing into first job classes, then onto second job classes.  With each branch off, you get more choice into what you want your character to be like.  And of course the model is different with ever different class.      Sounds pretty cool, no?  There's one thing better than all that.  It's completely free!  That is, if you do it right.  There are several free servers out there, such as NovaRO, SilentRO, AegisRO, MattRO, just to name a couple.  All the servers play the same as well, the only real difference is the amount of people and who is on.      With that in mind, i think i'm going to play some right now!     Lates
