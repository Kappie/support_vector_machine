I've been telling everyone like a pompous ass about my 100 on the physics test, which you've probably heard unless you've been living under a rock or you've stabbed yourself to death after hearing me saying it so many times. I didn't forget any homework. Chicken tenders for lunch. No class seemed to drag on too long. Leftover pizza in the refrigerator when i got home. Amazing days like that are few and far between.  Anyway, I've now fulfilled my legal obligation to talk about shit in my life that nobody really cares about. Back to the good stuff.    Whaaaaat is the deal with people who make sarcastic jokes and then retract them immediately after they make them? I'll bring out my good friend SomeLoser to demonstrate this absolutely annoying trait.      SomeLoser:  so anywayz  NerveStaple: yeah? what's up  SomeLoser:  i gained 300 pounds today.  NerveStaple:  hehe  SomeLoser:  no i really didn't, i'm sorry.  The only way to properly describe my feelings at this point is to use the following phrase:     WTF?!?!?!!!!!?!       Seriously, people. You don't need to dumb down your jokes for the benefit of the ignorant. If someone doesn't get it through their thick skull that the completely outrageous and wacky thing you're saying in a SARCASTIC TONE OF VOICE is SARCASTIC, then they deserve to get the wrong impression.  And I hate you all. Not really, i'm sorry.  End Transmission.
