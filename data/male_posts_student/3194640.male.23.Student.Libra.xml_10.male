Because you're nice (and you didn't get a gift reciept), you'll keep it for a while. When it gets "lost" (sold) you know you're happy to be rid of it, but at the same time, you feel horrible when the person who gave you the gift asks you how you're enjoying it. That's kind of how I feel. I'm happy there's little-to-no work to do, but I feel horrible because I feel like should be doing something better with my time today. I can never win because I'm never satisfied.  If I feel like it, I'll post some more later.  Word.
