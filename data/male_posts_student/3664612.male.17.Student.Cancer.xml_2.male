Well I thought I did a pretty crap speech, but everyone kept telling me it was good. I hate it when people do that. They say you did a good job but deep inside they thought you did a really crap oral. Pisses me off so much. Any who, my prediction was correct, Netherlands did beat Latvia 3-0 and the Czech Republic did beat Germany 2-1. Well tonight is the game, England vs Portugal. But im confident that England will beat the host nation, reason why is because this England squad is the best i've seen in a long time. With the young striker Rooney I believe that England will be too much for Portugal. Right now im too lazy to write, so ill end it here. Ta-ta for now
