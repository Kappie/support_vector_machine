This is why, among other reasons, thompsonian*NET hasn't been updated regularly (or at all) lately. Anyway, let's not laugh at me, let's laugh at the on-line support I get from school (I will not name the school).  The on-line instruction page says:   The actual class will start Saturday February 14th. When you log in on Saturday, you will see your list of available classes. If you do not see your class or you are having login problems, please call the office M-F, 8am-5pm for help, 1 800 XXX-XXXX.  Does anyone else see a potential malfunction here? What happens if, for instance, I log in on Saturday for my first class and I cannot get in? Apparently I should wait until Monday to ask about it. Fun. My school offers courses in Information Technology Management. I won't be taking any of them but, then again, I don't think the ITS staff has either.
