It pains me to see Bipasha Basu, Aishwarya Rai and the other Bollywood glam-sham joining the torch relay when honourable sportsmen/women like PT Usha be given a chance of the prestige and honour of carrying an Olympic torch. This is nothing but sheer disrespect of sporting culture and heritage, especially when it comes to Olympics. And then we complain of a population of one billion not being able to produce champions who can win medals for the country.   I won't complain about cricketers taking part in the rally, although instead of bringing in hordes of cricketers, they could have asked a select few to join in. After all they are themselves symbols of courage, bravery, and discipline in the nation's unofficial top sport, never mind if it's not a part of the Olympics. But what is the Bollywood gang doing here? Do they have even the slightest of ideas what a dishonourable act they are commiting by agreeing to take part in the relay? I sincerely hope they do! Aishwarya might be the darling of Indians, but as a citizen of India, she does not, and should not, deserve the right to don the Athens colours and carry the torch. Does she even know what it means to be a part of competitive Olympics? No! Nobody knows, except for the men/women who have actually competed. Aish and the entire filmdom has let us down, bigtime! And the next thing I cannot imagine is people thronging to see her (yes, only   her  ) making that 100 metre dash carrying the torch. Now, am I pissed off or what. I have seen the 2002 Winter Olympics flame pass through Colorado State University, and a very memorable event it was; not only for the University, but also for the few hundred people who had gathered around the picturesque Oval inspite of falling snow and cold wintry conditions, to cheer the torch-bearer.  What a sad day. We have fallen in the eyes of the entire sporting world. Shame on, India.   P.S.: Harsha Bhogle, brilliant as ever, hits the nail on the head in his  urlLink article  in the Indian Express
