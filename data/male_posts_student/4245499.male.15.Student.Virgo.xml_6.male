That was nice.. I'm gonna do that again. I watched Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle today, and I think that was the best movie I ever saw! I am now motivated... I am now inspired... to live out my life to the mother fucking fullest (while I'm high [or while I'm full...]). Poor Asian-Americans.. met with so much adversity and roadblocks. And that korean guy... developing multiple epiphanies throughout the movie, each getting shot down by a greater dissapointment. But in the end, they came out winners.... INSPIRATIONAL, I TELL YOU. And now to go on my adventures... and the road to victory and happiness. And that road starts with a fuck load of pot.. and will end with a fuck load of little tiny burgers. Join me and my quest for greatness.....   And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
