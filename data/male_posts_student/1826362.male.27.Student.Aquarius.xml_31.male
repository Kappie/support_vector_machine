Trying to get everything done in time to watch the Patriots play the Eagles on sunday.  cuz I like drinkin' and watchin' football.  Which is a nice segue into a letter I got from a reader this morning:  Dear Dreamy Steve, When I go to bars, I see all these people drinking fun looking drinks out of oversized glasses.  I want to join the "in" crowd and order a pretentious beverage the next time I go out, but I'm not quite sure how to do it.  Can you help? -Pretentious Ambitions in PA  Well PA in PA I know that all those drink choices can be daunting if you don't know your way around a trendy bar.  have no fear, Dreamy Steve will help. Martinis are a great choice if you want to appear pretentious.  Having said this, I should warn you that many people think they taste like lighter fluid.  But you don't have to actually drink it; we're just going for appearance here. Go to your favorite dive bar, get good and lubricated, then stride confidently to a hipper, trendier bar, and order a Bombay martini, dry with olives.   Carry this around with you for instant pretentious cred.  And don't worry about drinking the damn thing, you'll spill half of it just walking from the bar to your group of new friends. Hope this helps PA.  have a question for Dreamy Steve?  leave it as a comment.
