But after school, I was suppose to conduct sec 1 sectionals. But I told YZ that I had to leave at 3.45pm. Then just when I was about to start, I received a call. ZQ said his coming to fetch me soon. Then I continued. Just 5 minutes later, he called back, and said he'll be here in 10 minutes. Then I had to go la. So in the end, I didn't conduct. hehe...Then went to buy phone, yeah!!! Then my sister took so long to decided. Cause she didn't know which Samsung phone she wanted. Somemore they were all so expensive. Then I went to get my GD-68 at the Singtel shop la. Took sometime, at first didn't like it. But now, I think it's very nice. Can record voice as ringtone somemore. Then I went with ZQ to Heartland mall. We were supposed to meet some of the Student Coordinators for dinner, but in the end many didn't turn up, while the rest were late. Then was like touring about the SC with ZQ. Then we went to church for the facilitator training for this saturday. hehe...so exciting. Hope jie's coming. Then we went thru the game ourselves. As for now, I can't say much, cos some YFers come here too. So I'll just leave it to this saturday. Then I woke up today, and started setting my phone up. It's so cool, somemore got color, altho it's only 256, but it's nice la. Oh well, gotta run along. It's Vesak Day today. Nothing much to do. Actually all church stuff, but it's more relaxing la.
