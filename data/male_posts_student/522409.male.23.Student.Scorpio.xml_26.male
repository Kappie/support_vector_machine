Well, whatever the reason, I got pretty much everything done for my Berklee application, and so I'm really excited.  I had to call the College Board to have my SAT, SAT II, and AP scores sent, and had a rather disappointing experience.  See, because I took them more than a year ago, they were in the archive.  Archive.  They told me my scores were in the archive and I couldn't help picturing my scores on yellowing, dust-covered pages.  I know I'm not that old, but I felt old.  Having your College Boards forwarded in what should be my senior year in college... eh.  Whatever.  I have no complaints about the way things are right now.  It was just... amusing.  So the really exciting part was writing my personal statement.  That was my favorite part of applying back when I was in high school, and it's still the best part of the application.  There was no open response option, so I answered the question about career goals and how Berklee's curriculum and environment will help me attain them.  Woo.  And I wrote a song yesterday.  That was theraputic.  All these emotions that have been building up over the past 4 or 5 months, and little snippets of songs floating around... I sat at my piano yesterday and got it all out.  I think that helped, too.  lyrics, lyrics, lyrics... I love lyrics.  Here's a good set...   Moonlight Serenade- Kurt Elling Understand the night, when she flashes her sparkling eyes at dusk, she flirts with twilight. When the noise of day dies away, the night and twilight stay and stay making quiet love up high over the clouds. And the gentle twilight gives his light, making a queen of night. If I could, I would write a sonnet of the night as a rememb'rance of your eyes, And if you'd promise not to tell, I could whisper the words in the dark like a lover. We could count the stars--the shooting stars--and talk of lovers through the ages who had lived out of their dreams. Such will and spirit, courage they needed to live in a dream. To burn with every breath so serene, as if they had been the first to find love at all, Like night and twilight--they were the first of lovers ever. Could we be like them?  Hold on to one another until dawn comes?   Then we'd fly off and dream until night and twilight kiss again...  My love, my one and only love,  let me take you out under the moonlight, and show how the twilight loves the night,why he lives for an hour of loving through lifetimes of longing, and sings his moonlight serenade.    Good song.  Kurt Elling, man.  That guy...  So I'm worried that a friend of mine is upset with me.  I'm not sure whether this feeling is based in any way on facts, it's just a feeling I've got.  But I get that feeling a lot, actually, without there ever being a reason for it.  Blah.  Today's weather is disgusting.  It really is.  It's the kind of weather that could kill your motivation entirely, but it won't kill mine.  I'm going to go out and do... stuff.    For now, I'm also going to close this blog entry.
