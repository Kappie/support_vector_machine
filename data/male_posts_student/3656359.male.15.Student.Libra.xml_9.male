I sometimes think its what i have to do, and other times i feel how can i?, after all shes been through. And i said id be different, what a crock of shit.  So bradshaw beats eddie guerrero, the same belt that has been worn by Flair, Hogan, Hart and Austin, now worn by freakin Bradshaw, that made me depressed to start. That and the wierd paul bearer concrete thing, makes me glad i didnt fork out 15 quid for it.  Gettin me Beavis and Butt-head videos tommorow, looking 4ward to that.  Should be a good tennis game tommorow, serena v the fit russian with a kool scream.sharapova.  and thts about it, im drained, emotionally and physically, im no longer a school student, we had our ball yesterday, and i suppose that made me open my eyes too, i enjoyed havin the feel of playin the field again, Im 16 for fucks sake. I danced wit me mates, we was all tryin to look kool, and i dance wit amy eli and sarah, everyone looked gorgeous, and i looked ok in a tux, betta then i thought i wood be!  newyas im gonna sleep, l8er m.c
