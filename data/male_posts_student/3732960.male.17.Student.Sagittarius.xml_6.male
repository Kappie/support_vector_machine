(which is exactly what she said to him). Then i hear he's bitching because me and my brothers dont do his yardwork anymore. my ma says he said something along the lines of "Im not doin all this yard work myself, those boys dont do anything around here" or something to that effect... ok, me and my brothers are no longer 10, 12, and 16 years old anymore! we're 17, 19, and 23! we all have more important things to do LIKE OUR JOBS than his yard work. I have summer school every day, and then most of those days, i have to go to work a couple hours later! and then on the weekends im either working one job or the other, or both! i dont have time to do that shit and he knows it. seriously, he just likes bitching and acting like no one is useful except himself, and its really fucking annoying. Im sick of him telling me how im useless and getting a "free ride" because when i was younger, we busted ass helping him with stuff. Sorry dad, that we have lives now.
