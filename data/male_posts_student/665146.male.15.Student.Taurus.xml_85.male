All I can really think to write in here anymore is, "Oh my God:  SOTA blah and SOTA drugs blah."  And who'd want to read that?  As if I'd have the balls to post anything I've written either.  At least, nothing I can't defend with a braindead moment.  But hey, come to our performance October 10th.  It's at 7 at the SOTA auditorium.  Please, support the arts.
