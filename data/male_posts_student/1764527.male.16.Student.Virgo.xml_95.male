Enewayz, I actually think I did very well.  I thought the math was very easy, almost simplistic.  Which of course had me asking "is this too easy? Am I missing something?"  I hate it when I start to second-guess myself when I think I'm doing well.  I think something that really helped was the fact that I knew the format of the test and knew better ways of taking the test.  I didn't read the directions; I knew that the harder questions came after the easier question; I knew that skipping questions made less sense that accepting the gamble of an incorrect answer; I knew that one of the sections wouldn't score (it's used as a key to make sure the test is scored fairly for the pool that took it today); I knew that the key section was one of the verbal sections, which hopefully means that my verbal score will be slightly better because I usually feel weaker in verbal.  I'm pretty sure that my knowledge of the test helped me perform better, which should hopefully translate into a higher score.  I'm shooting for a score of 1400 or better which would be a nearly 200 point jump, from 1230 to 1400+.  It's not unheard of, but quite difficult once you get into these higher scores. 
 I'm taking the ACT in two weeks and am shooting for a two or three point gain, from a 30 to a 32 or 33.  I want the 32 because that would tie with Ms. DeSha's score and a 33 because it would beat it.  My thirty tied with Ms. Daily which gave me immense satisfaction because I know I'm better than her and, well, it made me feel better about having to go into her class every morning last year.  LOL, I crack myself up. 
 Enewayz, I'm gonna go now and work on redesigning the border frames for the school website.  Ms. Purcell-Orleck wants me to use a  deeper red  rather than the  red that's in use now .  She wanted to use a maroon color, but I vetoed that because East's colors are  red  and white/gray and  not  maroon.  I also said I preferred the  lighter/brighter red  to the  deeper one  because East is flashier but the deeper is classier, so I'll try both.
