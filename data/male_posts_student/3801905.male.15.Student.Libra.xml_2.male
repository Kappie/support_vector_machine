Hugo, on of her kids, insisted that he wanted a green strawberry, after his mother's failed attempts at telling him they didn't exist, I told him that the kiwifruit was really a strawberry. He then demanded to have his strawberry washed so he could eat it. It really made me smile.  I think I've changed my mind about having kids, they're so much fun. I even sat down with them and made a llama out of lego with them. I then continued to make a tree and a shrub for the llama, all of which are now proudly perched on the kitchen mantle piece.  "Oh teach me how not to think" Romeo, from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Sometimes I wish that I didn't think so much. I know it sounds stupid but I seem to be constantly analyzing things. Take for example, years 6,7,8. During this time I did not know who I was. I'm sure you've all heard the phrase "Just be yourself". What if you do not know what is you, and what is not. What does a person compare to in this kind of situation.  Humans are very reliant on what is normal. Take for example, your mother. Now you would say, she is what all mothers are like, other peoples mothers are just other mothers, but yours is the real type of mum. The thing is, we don't have anything else to compare to, so well take that which we experience and call it normal. For some, ideas of normal can be inherited. Homophobia is a great example of this. Many parents are homophobic also pass it on to their children.   "The human mind can not stand too much reality" It's amazing how true this is, we see all the deaths in Iraq and other countries and lay there, lifeless, waiting for the next episode of friends to burst into our living-rooms. I guess it all boils down to what you want out of life. You see a poor man freezing on the street on a cold, rainy winters night, you can either walk past him and think nothing of it, give him a few loose coins to make yourself feel not so bad or take him in, get him rugged up and find a place where he can stay.  I was out in town the other day and passed a lady selling magazines to help raise money to save the forests. There seemed to be a general way the people would react, they would either walk as far away from here as possible or look intently at the pavement. The dismissal of guilt it really unhealthy, how can a person really be asked "could you please help save Tasmania's old growth forests?" and shake their head, they'd rather spend their money on some nice food for dinner tonight, or a new hair colour.  "Truth needs no laws to support it. Throughout history, only liars and lies resort the courts to mandate belief."  Even if it's just to make someone's day. Give them something to talk about "guess what happened today..."  Finish that sentence for someone, anyone. Don't de it because of guilt, but because you want to.  Go do something amazing today...  ~Paul
