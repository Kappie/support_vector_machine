SO not. so i was thinking we could make a game like the hot or not game.. like.. paul bridges? NOT! shay baldwin? HOT! but it had to be something funnier that people found.. intriguing.. SEX! so i offically made up sex or rape.. by senior year everyone will be playing it! heres how you play, its easy, if you like someone enough to have sex with them you say "sex" and if they are on you're "FAT, UGLY, STUPID, or ALL AROUND NASTY" list, you say "rape!" totally awesome.  geometry was fun.. crystal and i studied for the french test. i changed my french book cover, it's a now! hell ya! abercrombie Vintage :-* nathalie met us dans la hallway and we walked around and then i eventually went to the library.. NATHALIE LET ME USE HER iPOD! soooooo fetch. i listened to music and did homework and then nathalie came in and we went to buy food and then i went to pe. PE WAS CRAZY! we did this HUGE long run, through the park.. its a really nice park, down the creek (which smells like dominic's butt) and around the soccer feild. aww so many memories of the fire day.. i love the soccer feild. OH YEAH! we were locked out of the gym at the start of the period so ivy, krista, elizaveth and me played sex or rape. so great. stephaine hammond?

YEAH! he is so my white chocolate. ooh, lizette, gardenia and i came up with a new thingy..  okay>>>> which do you like best (IN ORDER!) white chocolate milk chocolate dark chocolate.  okay so white = white, milk = hispanic and dark = black. AND THOSE ARE WHAT KIND OF GUYS YOU LIKE! they should make oriental chocolate.. otherwise it isnt very fair.. but yeah.. it KINDA works.. unless you're allergic to chocolate.  uhh at the end of pe christine and i had a heart felt convo about homophobia. it was really funny. and she ended with an "i love ya brandon!" who doesnt? ryan austin back up into my groin in the locker room. weird? very.  lunch was devoted to french-ness and watching blake eat his sandwhich. and then nathalie and i walked up with carolyn and played the COOLEST GAME- sex or rape. WHOEVER INVENTED THAT GAME (me) IS A GENIUS!!  french was tres fun. we studied for the test and i thought about.. uhh... the test was easy, at least i thought it was. and the speaking/extra cred. was lots of fun. jenica or zenikwah as em calls her, looked really cute in her new skirt.

I LOVED THAT MUSICAL! im buying the DVD and then im moving to anatevka!  -------------TRADITION--------------  saturday i woke up pretty early for me. usually i dont wake up until after two, but i woke up around one-ish. i spent the day getting ready for a wedding that night. yeah, it was fun.  it turns out that jack didnt come to the musical cause he was too busy giving and recieving head from jaye in the back of a car being driven by lesbians. how cute :D. see, that's what real love is. uhh i was pissed at both of them.. and i told jack how i cheated with him.. a lot.. over the course of our relationship. but then again, it wasn't a real relationship! cause that's what he told everyone. i'm glad we worked through that drama.  i was kinda depressed, although i'd never admit to it, when i went to the wedding. it was fun. they always make me tearing and sleepy. my mom's friend carol married some peirce brosman look alike named Jim or Tim or Tom or something.. yeah.. the reception was fun and i had.. wine.. and stuff.. it was okay.  when i got home.. or when "we" got home, my dad passed out.. hahaha. i chugged a 2 liter of coke and then nathalie and tin tin called and we talked. i dont remember much of it. i made up a song though.  then around 12 amber came online and we talked for *hours*. it was so much fun.. we sent pics and gossiped and played sex or rape.. didnt we? oh well, i got a cute pic of shay hehe. and she got some EMBARASSING ones of christine and naomi =-o ronnie called (what else is new) and he was pretty boring. i think i fell asleep. my dad woke me up at like 5 ish and told me to go to bed. so i did.  in the morning/afternoon, i worked on my homework and then i thought i would go to the mall with jack. we had decided to stay friends, hes too much of a great guy to let go :-) even if he is just going to play me. at least ill always have the memories :-?  uhh he couldnt go because he had "work" to do. yeah, work do do with jaye. blah. i went to longs first and saw jaye.. it hurt to think that jack would do something like that to jaye.. i mean.. he never really showed much intrest in jaye. but then again jaye wanted jack a lot. i mean a lot a lot. like how when you're young you really wanna go on the caroseul, but then when you get on you feel jipped because it sucks.  well i bought gum and then my mom took me to GAP and i got a bunch of new clothes and flirted with this CUTE!! salesman! he was like "do you want to get a room?" and "if you need any help i can come in at any time". as mr. shonick would say - "WOAH NELLI!"  i bought a jacket, pants and two new shirts. well.. my mom did. she said she would take me to valley fair sometime to check out the selection there. i agreed. uhh we left the mall and i went home and slept and did more homework. I barely did the research paper for miranda. so pointless.. i went to bed early.. i think.. i dont really remember what i did. oh yeah but jaye got pissed at me because i showed my emotions and told him how much i liked jack and stuff.. psh, he's the one who blew my former and soon to be boyfriend while driving around the boardwalk. WHAT HAPPENED TO "I DONT WANT FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS" !? but i digrese.  oh yeah, i talked to chris i think.. he seems like a big asshole now, and he drinks a lot. not that i dont drink.. i just dont drink A LOT. yeah!  monday was so good. it is days like those when i realize i love soquel and would never under any circumstances go to another school. geo was all about studying for the test. crystal drew this picture of this guy but then it looked like soem creepy guy from a movie so she threw it at me and then i threw it back at her and then she threw it and it hit katia. haha. katia was like "HEY THIS LOOKS LIKE MY UNCLE!" only not that loud. piano was fun. CEG EGC GCE CEG C C C C C. uhh you noe who i think just SCREAMS fag? connor clark. hes got that whole femininness too him. plus he was looking at me funny when i went in the band room-ness. annie was the fifth person to notice my NEW jacket. crystal, katia, nathalie and carolyn were the others. WOO! annie said i looked like i lost a lot of weight. nope, i just cried, vomited and shit a lot. :) then in my open i listened to THE BRITNEY SPEARS CD! i rescued it from under my bed. aww it was fun and i read TKAM. SOOO GOOD! i guess i looked really attractive cause alicia said eddy was staring at me alot. that kid is too tan. and hes kinda gross.. with his weird ankles. im sorry, but im not a fan of the noodles ;) aww that was mean. HAHA scary movie 3 quote: i have a bad feeling like when you see an asian person behind the wheel of a car. HA HA HA! poor asians. well then it was off to miranda. where we took a fucking quiz. yay. then we talked about TKAM. and we got a new project. on top of the revolutionary essay. uhh. anyway, everyone liked my new jacket. even alec complimented me. aw. pe was fun as always with G and L! elizabeth noticed my new jacket (like everyone else) and was like "woah, JACKet JACK! haha!" and i was like "uhh.. yeah" i cant go anywhere with out hearing about him. jeez. lunch was tasty, shonick was fun (we studied for the test) and so was french. we just did p.p. verbs. HAHA if i werent in that clas sit wouldnt be half as fun as it is now. alicia was moved to the desk in front of the cabinet and keppie started talking so i was like "alicia! there's candy behind you!" and she liked hopped forward and pulled out the candy and she jumped with the desk and threw it to everyone. yum. then while mrs keplinger was trying to "contain" her i ran up and got a bunch of yummy sour worms and started munching on them. what can i say, im a rebel. after we were settled, alicia was eating this lollipop and she was all "eW! this tastes like shit!" and mrs k was like "thats prolly form the rats that pee in there" and i laughed so hard. haha it was great. alicia was like "i've tasted cum better than this shit! shut up brandon, you're gay!" haha it was so funny. christine started dying of a heart attack too and we both fell on the floor. it was sooo funny.   uhh afterschool my mom picked me up and i just went home and did homework. it was weird not having jaye around.. i do miss him. he was a great friend, and im sad that he is gone. but i must focus on other things now, like school and getting abs.  nathalie and i talked and i did homework and we studied and yeah. i slept. NIGHTIE!  math was fun. the test was hard but i knew it. at least i felt like i did. i dunno how i did on the last two.. how many lateral faces does an octogonal right prism have if you cut of the side paralell to the tangeted of the circle inscribed in the base. uh.. and is the diameter of the sphere in proportion to the cone in which it is inscribed if the cone has r 5 and the sphere has r 4? uh.. crystal cheated of me HAHA and they were different tests. nathalie and i walked to the lockers after the test.. then i went to piano and relaized i forgot my book so i went to the lockers to get it and i saw crystal. we walked together and waved at nathalie and kevin g. in enzwiler. yeah! and then piano was alrite.. ronnie texted me and threw my concentration off. and joe v. and i had a staring contest. haha. hes cute in a jock with no muscles sort of way. and hes REALLY smart!

The torch I bear is scorching me  Buffy’s laughing, I've no doubt  I hope she fries, I'm free if that bitch dies  I better help her out  'Cause she is  Drawn to the fire  Some people...  She will never learn  Both: And she will Walk through the fire  and let it...  Will this do a thing to change her?  Am I leaving dawn in danger?  Is my slayer too far gone to care?  What if Buffy can't defeat it?  Beady eyes is right, we're needed  Or we could just sit around and glare  All: We'll See it through  It's what we're Always here to do  so we will  Walk through the fire   So one by one, they turn from me  I guess my friends can't face the cold  What can't we face?  But why I froze, Not one among them knows  And never can be told  She came from the grave much graver One by one, they come to me  First, he’ll kill her, then I’ll save her  Everything is turning out so dark Going through the motions  No, I’ll save her, then I’ll kill her  I think this line is mostly filler What's it going to take to strike a spark? It's what they have inside  She will come  These endless days Are finally ending in a blaze  All: And we are Caught in the fire  The point of no return  So we will  Walk through the fire  And let it burn   ~*~  so while nathalie, chrstina and crystal were at the cincenria (i dont noe how to spell) i finished all my homework.  okay. here's the story.  nathalie and christina didnt talk and nathalie hated her for like.. two months?  and then crystal and nahtalie go to a bon fire at the beach, make out with some random guys, christina comes and gets drunk, nathalie offers to take her home and does even though christina protests a little. anyway, nathalie mom shows up and christinas like "DAVID YOU HAVE TO COME HOME!
