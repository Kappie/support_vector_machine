It wouldn't surprise me either if we didn't get anything and it ends up being 90Â° out. Meteorologists aren't gods. Plus they're wrong half the time anyway. We better go to the Y tomorrow. If we don't then you're lucky until we go next time. Which will probably be soon anyway, so whatever. You won't win femme fatale. Anyway today I was hoping for no school, but a delay was cool. Some things just never get old. WATERRRR WATERRRR. If you don't get it, ignore that. But wow that was great. Guess you had to have been there which most of you weren't so 99% of you disregard that. I should think before I write crap down. And no, unlike most of you folks think, I do not spend hours proof reading and editing my entries. It's all spur of the moment. Yet it still takes me a half hour to write this crap no one reads. I've been doing this blog action for awhile now. Maybe 2 months? I have no clue, but I think I've been doing it way too long. My thought process is this. I register to get a blog. I write in my blog. I see the counter rise slowly, so I assume people are viewing it. I realize no one is. I continue to write just for the sake of wasting time. It's really a sad pattern but what are you gonna do. There really isn't anything else to do in this weather. I don't like skiing or snowboarding. But i hafta push  you  off the ski lift one time.. I can't play basketball outside. Well I can, but I'd prefer not to die of hypothermia just yet. Plus today walking home, I had a sweater and jacket on and everything, yet I was still freezing cold. Stupid wind. I really can't wait until summer. No school, plus I can go outside without worrying about dying. All I know is, we better play basketball a whole lot when summer comes. I'm not waiting another (counts on fingers for a minute...) 5 months for nothing. Ok I'm gonna stop writing now. Wish I was too dead to care, if indeed I cared at all.. Listen to H.I.M.
