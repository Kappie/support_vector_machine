You can argue that Zim shouldn't have been out on the field, and that point is valid, but seriously if you're Pedro can't you merely side step the charging bull instead of "helping" him to the ground? -The assult in the NY pen.  Can't comment too much cause I don't know many facts, but if the Yankee's pitchers nailed the guy in the mouth and he had to go to the hospital for cleat marks on his back, something is seriously wrong.  I'm sure there was plenty of security/police presence around the place.  Call one of them instead of deciding to beat the crap out of some guy. -Yankees won, making tomorrow a must win.  But Boston has been in worse positions  On to brighter news  Cubs are one game away from the World Series.  Do I believe?  A resounding yes.  I hope it gets wrapped up tomorrow.  And I don't want to jinx (a word all too framiliar in the lexicon of a dual Sox Cubs fan) what's going on, but I have to like the Cubbies chances should Zambrano not be able to close things out tomorrow.  With Prior and Wood being the last two starts if they are needed, things seem to be good.  You could say I'm causiously optomistic.
