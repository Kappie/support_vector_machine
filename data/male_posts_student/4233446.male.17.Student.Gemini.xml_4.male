Three of us are all really feeling the same thing so it kind of helped for us to be around each other and just chill for a few hours.  At least it helped me.  I'm still really depressed, but not quite as lonely.  I know there's people that care about me but I just feel that there's no one there.  The one person that could probably make me feel better right now isn't on and oh how I wish she was.  *sigh* Oh well.  I'm just gonna leave it at that for the day.
