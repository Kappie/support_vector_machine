Well I have plenty of things to do, but they're not "nice". I can do research about Paul Bernardo, maybe find an ad to do my spoof ad assignment on. But... I don't wanna. As boring sitting here doing nothing is, there r worse things. Namely, hw. Sigh, I'm too tired to say anything or think anything or remember anything now... I'm gonna leave today like this... no interesting new topic, no mind-bogling afterthought, just a mental image of my very tired self: an Oriental kid, looks to be around 15, male, sitting with his ass sliding off a black ergonomic chair. His hair is all over his face and he is too tired to brush it away. His eyes r open only a slit, as if he's too tired to open them but too scared to close them. He's wearing a small black t-shirt with grey and white stripes along the sleaves. He's wearing black worn out Khakis with at least one hole in it, at the knee. His socked feet r under the desk in a rest position. His fingers and hands seem to be the only animated part of him, dashing back and forth across a dirty keyboard. In fact, from afar, the kid looks quite dead. He turns to look out the window and sees u... He screams... U scream... U run down the street, screaming in a frantic state. Because of ur current lack of focus, u run into a lamp post and hit ur head hard. U fall... And c the Oriental kid's face as u fall unconscious...
