Los Chicas!  *laughs*  We got the idea because there is a store named Chicos and it is a store for girls, but in Spanish, chicos means boys.  So, for our name we did the reverse, and just to screw things up we added a "Los" which is masculine, instead of "Las"...*laughs* I know...it's confusing....it's stupid...it's perfect....we don't want a normal name...we want a stupid name so people will be curious and have to check us out *laughs*   We also have all agreed that Ben will be the lead singer (our bassist).  We found out that I cannot sing....long story....has to do with volume and stuff.....and Ben has more balls than I do....So we are all set to go....we are gonna start getting serious now.  We also have our stage names: Ben Peters- Ben Jamin Mike Sochalski- Murhur Andrew Schultz- Shizults (I hate it, but...everybody else seems to like it)  We have 2 songs pretty much down.  First is  "Stupid Naive Little Boy" ...I wrote it about myself, and Ben is singing it, and if anybody asks, it's about me....I wrote it...Ben is just singing it...The only thing we need to do to finish the song is that Ben has to memorize the lyrics so he can play and sing at the same time. Second is the first song we learned....it never had a name...and we could never seem to apply lyrics to it...so it is an instumental song....we are going to add horn parts later to spice it up....and it will be called,  "The 1st Song."   Clever huh?  That's all for now....but man, I am totally stoked to see this crummy band finally starting to get somewhere.....Los Chicas are in full throttle!
