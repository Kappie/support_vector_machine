There were 13 year olds we started to it on, major fun. We stopped playing when Paul being a stupid jackass threw the ball from outfield to home to get James out but the ball smacked him in the ear. Turns out he needs antibiotics and hurt his ear and crap. What are the chances but I said that was gonna happen. I said it in the beginning, and I knew it would happen when someone was running home. It was Heaton James and I and we crushed them. Heaton made an astonishing hit to outfield, good job ol chap. After the game Matt Paul and I slept at Hoffman's. Poor James couldn't because of his ear and he had to go to his mom's in the morning and poor poor Heaton was really sad he couldn't come because his mom was paranoid and didn't know who Jason was. We all felt really bad for Heaton. He was walking all slouched over and sad. )= But anyways, the night was awesome. We played on Jay's Guns N Roses Pinball machine which is addicting and so much fun. And we all talked about mackin Jay's sister to piss him off only I'd really mack it fo weel. We watched part of Apocolypse Now and I pointed out Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) is very skinny 20 year old in the movie and everyone was like OMG. We watched alot of late night porn shit that Jay gets on his tv, lucky bastard. Then the Ring. We also wrestled. I actually took down Paul! Then westayed up until 4 in the morning crying of laughter.Next day, today...we just hung out and Matt and Paul went home and thenJay and I hung out and at night sawBorn IdentitywithJared and Ryan. It was fun. Isaw Mrs.Kalabza. Now I'm tired and I'm gonna catch up on sleep considering last night I got 5hours. Tomorrow Kaiser'sbeach party?
