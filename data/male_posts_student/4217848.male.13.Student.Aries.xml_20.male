They did skirmish with the two harpies who had escaped, but Tali deftly shot them from the sky, skewering them on the same arrow. At dusk, they landed in a forest for the night.   The tent was set; the canteens were filled; Helsing’s scales were shined. All that remained was to build a fire. As Tali’s golden cat eyes were specialized to see in the deepest shadows, she went alone to get the wood. Helsing flew to rest on a high cloud so as to keep a better vigil for harpies and their slaves. Kazoran entered the tent and lay down on his pallet.   He was madly in love with that nymph. She was everything he had wanted and needed during those lonely years in his father’s citadel in the Glade. There was nothing he desired more than to spend the rest of his life with her. How much longer must he wait to marry her and truly be one?     ¤¤¤   The witch had seen them coming, the nymph, the wyvern. All that interested her was the man. The beautiful man. The witch was an elf with eternal youth: youth that was bitterly spent alone in these woods. Few people had ever come into the forest. The witch longed for someone to love. She gathered her potions and summoned the nightshade.   ¤¤¤   Tali was mewing to herself contentedly. Chopping wood with her sharp claws, the nymph listened to the sounds of the forest. Suddenly, her ears erected. Something was moving. Something big. Kazoran was all alone at the camp. Talli dropped the kindling and ran. Hold on Kazi!   ¤¤¤  The nightshade was enormous. It was black as the deepest shadow in the ocean’s depths. Its eyes alone glowed red. It continued to lunge at Kazoran with lethal claws. Kazoran parried, lunged, and dodged with the Vorpal Sword. Yet the beast’s thick, armor-like skin deflected every blow. The creature’s size prevented it from matching the bard’s speed, but Kazoran was using much more energy than the nightshade was and would also tire before the monster. It occurred to him that the nightshade did not want him dead. It attacked with purpose, but did not use its full strength. Well, it wouldn’t have him. Eventually, the nightshade tired of the game and flicked the blade from Kazoran’s hand. It pressed him down under its giant claw and began to draw him deeper into the forest…   "Stop!" cried Tali bounding in front of the nightshade. "Sit. Release. Heel." The beast obeyed without a word, letting go of Kazoran and sitting as a docile dog might do for an owner it had known since puppyhood. Kazoran stood and pulled Tali close.   "Stop!" The cry rang through the forest a second time. The elf-witch materialized from behind a tree in the shadows. "I have lived alone in these woods for a millennia! My eternal youth has been lonely and ill spent. The bard comes with me, to love and cherish me."   To this, the nymph beast master had but one thing to say, and it was not to the witch. "Fetch."
