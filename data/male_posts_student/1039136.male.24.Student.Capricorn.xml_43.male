I've spent the better part of two hours facing alot of things I have buried deep inside because of the pain those things caused me. This included thinking back to memories both good and bad, reading some old letters, looking at pictures, all with a winamp providing me with a random soundtrack to the recollection of the last few years of my life.   In my last post, I spoke about how I felt like I was crashing and losing it, and didn't know how to stop.  I had some free time tonight and after watching the Shawshank Redemption, I was inspired to take this time I had and put it to good use. I realized I had to break free from my prison. "Get busy livin or get busy dying."  What I guess I haven't realized is that for the last few years, I have been alive but, I've been avoiding living...essentially I've been dying the whole time.     Kevin Carey told me the other night when I was near breakdown that I am too hard on myself, as I have mentioned in the last post as well.  After watching Shawshank I realized that mentally and emotionally, I, in a way locked myself in a prison. I've been through alot of hurt, pain, and just overall bad luck in my life, no doubt..but for some reason, I always carried this in a briefcase chained to my wrist...a briefcase of contempt, bitterness, self-pity, pain and remorse.      Tonight, I decided, would be the night to face those pains..because yeah, I went through alot of shit, but that doesnt mean I should have to every day wake up and be affected by the pain.   It hasn't even been directly that the negative emotions have affected me, since the "briefcase" was attached to my wrist, and not my mind or heart. Instead, these emotions had subtle effects on me..almost like they were whispering to me so quietly from inside the "briefcase" that only my subliminal mind could hear them.      So I did what I needed to do, I said, "FUCK THIS" and I went through everything emotionally painful imaginable...I took some huge wire cutters and cut the cuff that was binding the briefcase to my arm..I grabbed the briefcase and tossed it with force into a coffin.  With every tear I shed, every note I read, and every last bit of hurt, I put another nail in the coffin, and now it's closed.   I now have to bury all of this, for good. I would like to do that immediately, but i figure my subconcious and unconcious mind will best put it to rest when i'm asleep. So as of tomorrow morning, I am going to be free of a huge burden.  If you see a different me, don't be surprised, I don't have too much things to carry with me anymore.   I'm as wide eyed about my future now than ever. I'm hoping for the best to come in the future, and I know it's not all going to be easy, but from now on i'm going to face every hardship the same way I finally faced my "briefcase". I have to stand up and face it instead of locking it away somewhere inside.  The only thing left from any future pains should be a receipt saying, nice try life, John says, fuck off.      I know that I have to keep my mind in the right spot, and as long as i'm successful at this I have big things in store for me in life.      I really feel good about myself, i'm 24, about to graduate from college in less than a year, i'm good looking, and most of all, i'm refreshingly different.  I have strong desires, strong wills and a good heart.  I'm going to make alot of money...I'm going to land myself a beautiful wife in the future, and be a great father to kids who I am going to raise to be more succesful than I will already be, and to make things of themselves that I couldnt even imagine.      "It's funny how life turns out..the odds of faith in the face of doubt..camera one closes in..the soundtrack starts..the scene begins..  You're playin you now ...take a bow"
