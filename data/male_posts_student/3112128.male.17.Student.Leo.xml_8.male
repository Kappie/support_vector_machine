The first method of censorship is obvious and not often denied, but the second form of censorship is much more subtle, devious and (ironically) ignored. It is the method often employed by religious institutions and other organizations, lacking in the ability to suppress information. Sometimes, an establishment will employ both methods of censorship.  It is by euphemising and devaluing the importance of issues that ignorance can be encouraged and censorship achieved. It is almost as though the organization is 'dancing around the issue', by diverting attention and creating a facade, suggesting that the issue that is to be censored is of less importance than it truly is. This is the most aggrevating and wily form of censorship.  The most interesting form of censorship is the combination. By suppressing only select information, an issue does arise and is solved quickly and with the general impression that it is of little importance. Dealt with and over, people move on. The issue is made public and dismissed in an instance. However, without  some  issues occurring, sceptics arise. By letting minimal amounts of information be circulated about an issue, there is less chance of scepticism and more chance of general approval- a very likeable situation. Just enough for there to be an issue, though minimal enough to allow the issue to be dismissed and ignored.  Do not be ignorant and do not be afraid to question the information given. A sceptic is wise and a passionate sceptic- a hero.
