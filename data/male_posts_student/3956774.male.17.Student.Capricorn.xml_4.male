I shall rectify this insubordination ASAP. Hmmmm so what have I actually been up to??? A load of bugger all if you ask me, oh yes we went to Laurens yesteryear for a video evening which turned into just chatting and we neglcted the video, which I suppose was for the better, after which we left in the Early Hours and rolled home thus. But my chums I must away for I am being dragged to the Dungeon to start my training for Eclipse...ooooohhhhh...TatyBye
