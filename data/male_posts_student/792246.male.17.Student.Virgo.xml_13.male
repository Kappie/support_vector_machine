[01:02] CireOfNamellef: I only remember two things about spain [01:02] CireOfNamellef: my game gear got stolen [01:02] CornTOWM: that's only one thing [01:02] CireOfNamellef: and we were staying a month with some friends in a house belonging to their friends in the middle of nowhere and we ran out of water [01:02] CireOfNamellef: so we were all like, "where is the water!?" [01:03] CireOfNamellef: so I decided we should drink pool water cause I was stupid and 8 [01:03] CireOfNamellef: and they were like, youre stupid [01:03] CornTOWM: and eight? [01:04] CireOfNamellef: and then one of us spotted a moving object(a rare sight) at the bottom of the ginormous hill we are on and took out binoculars and saw the water truck and we all danced [01:04] CireOfNamellef: as in my age [01:04] CornTOWM: yeah, i got it [01:05] CornTOWM: but you said you were stupid and eight and then people were like "you're stupid" so i thought they'd say "and eight" too [01:05] CireOfNamellef: except my mom didnt dance, because she was puking every 5 minutes because of her late stage of pregnancy. so if she danced there would be puke everywhere and wed need lots of water to clean it up and we had just gotten the water [01:05] CireOfNamellef: ah [01:05] CireOfNamellef: i think i tell stories best at 1 AM [01:05] CornTOWM: that story was beautiful [01:05] CornTOWM: yeah [01:06] CireOfNamellef: but the worst part was my game gear was stolen [01:07] CireOfNamellef: along with my dads 2000 dollar company laptop that contained "confidential information"(which was usually just my dads way of feeling important. I think I even tried to find confidential information but I couldnt get past the 8 million and 2 passwords [01:07] CireOfNamellef: but its all about the game gear [01:07] CireOfNamellef: oh and all our clothes were stolen too(cept the ones we were wearing) [01:07] CireOfNamellef: but again, game gear [01:08] CireOfNamellef: the moral of the story is, spanish cops suck [01:08] CireOfNamellef: they never got my game gear back [01:08] CireOfNamellef: whores [01:08] CireOfNamellef: i should write a book [01:08] CireOfNamellef: hell, i think my future book is currently writing itself   One thing that I don't think ever made it onto the site is that Gabe and Jessica's very brief relationship had been dubbed by me "Coitus Primus". Just a fun fact to tell your friends. Note that it's Bun-Bun's old screenname. But damn, I was funny back then. I'm so cool.
