Well, over the weekend I successfully managed to gain a bad sunburn along with a touch of sun poisoning. All in all though, it went pretty well. Shot off a few (hundred) fireworks and had a great ole' time. I'm still waiting for a few people to actually call, I'll let you know if that happens. (If - key word)  Not much else to say. The new Taking Back Sunday CD comes out in about 22 days. Go rush out and get it when it does.
