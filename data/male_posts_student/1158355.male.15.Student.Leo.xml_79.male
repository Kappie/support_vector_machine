Yesterday, I did came home from Pat's, went to Paul's to hang out with him and Heaton. We watched Harry Potter... I hate those damn movies, they don't have a bit of revenge. It's just so dumb how Harry in the first and the second movie, kills the bad guy by either stabbing a book or giving him a face lift. It's so lame, if I were to make Harry Potter, there would be guns and explosions. There would be heads flying in the air, and bullets soaring through people's bodies. AND JESUS CHRIST, Robert Weasley's little sister was killed and the boy has Harry avenge her death for him. If I was Robert, I would pull off the matrix on that mother fuckin snake. Also, I'd stop using magic. It's so lame, it makes kids think they're so cool and magical. Well... anything to get kids away from gangsta clothing. Now little kids dress as wizards, not wankstas. Ok, so after watching Shitty Shitter: The Shitter of Shitlets, we went to Heatons and if you read Heaton's blogger, IT IS ALL WRONG. We watched The Animatrix and all of 9 cartoons were awesome. Maybe it's because I'm a Matrix fanatic so it amplifies how much I like something that has the word MATRIX on it, by about 10x. I kicked Paul's ass in Tony Hawk 3. I didn't want to go in the pool because I hate pools and it was freezing and I didn't have a bathing suit. Also, Paul and I weren't humping each other, I was kicking his ass once again. Mike's brother Billy brought us home and I was bored the rest of the night.  I must know. Is this a real world where some time in the future we will fall into the hands of our own creation... or am I actually dreaming right now and the future has already occured. I must know because if I am dreaming, I can believe and belief is fate, fate is the truth, and the truth leads to the ability to awaken oneself.
