Out of my FOUR friends, 2 were mostly gothic, 1 was more of a fedisher (for lack of a better term) and the other was the only of us that didnt wear dark clothes, the artist. Myself, I've kinda always been the middle man, a cross of all my friends dipped in acid and covered in nappy curly hair. Well, My friends and I have all had our problems, typical teengoth probs really, depression, relationship trouble, lost religion, lost reality...etc. None of us ever did drugs. For the most part we are all against drugs. Then one of my friends, the artist, met a guy. This guy was a big time stoner druggie, but despite his drug problems, we were happy for our friends for finding a guy. The guy managed to turn our girl into somewhat of a wreck. Ive heard rumors, and witnessed myself enough to belive he turned her to drugs. The artist girl started treating one of the 2 goths like shit, and practically mocked his problems, not cool. Now my artist friends has pretty muched gone away, and I'm left with only 3 friends. To my artist friend, Please, get back on the right path, I understand your disagreement with goth friend was deep, but it can be fixed, try to end this crap.
