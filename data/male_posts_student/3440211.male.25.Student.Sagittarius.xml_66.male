We shall see what happens in between... they show hints... as to those hints being enough that is another story. but who knows...  Research is like that I guess... you just get hints to pick up on....  Any how the week-end has landed and as usual i have no clue of what will happen who nows... hopefully something exciting....  Mood: average who knows... Anger still inside as no news have arrived... just have to bear with it I guess....
