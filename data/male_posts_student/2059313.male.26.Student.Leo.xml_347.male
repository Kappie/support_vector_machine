Now, I haven't been eating out or doing a lot of stuff because money is REALLY tight for me right now.  I went to eat with everyone but I was just going to have water and just go and hang out.  My friend and her new roommate conspired and bought me food without my knowledge.  Now, it was actually the roommate (who I barely know) that I later found out actually bought my meal.  I had tried to keep it low key so as not to attract any special attention or anything... I didn't want (and I didn't want anyone else) to make a big deal out of it.  I thanked her greatly.  On the way home, my eyes actually watered up a little bit.  No one has ever shown me that brand of kindness and caring before.  I barely knew her, and she paid for my dinner without a thought.  I guess what I've been brought up thinking really is true... God will provide.  She was just an instrument.  Thanks God, and thanks to my friend and her roommate.  Bless you both.
