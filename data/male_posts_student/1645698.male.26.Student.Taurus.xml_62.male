If I'm at all sarcastic to anyone tonight - I've had a very long evening, and would like to throttle most consumers at the moment.  I might make the suggestion that none of us ever work in retail . . .it's hard enough dealing with the ultimate stupidity of humanity on a daily basis; it's harder to fold their towels and smile while you do it. ^_^   XOXOXO
