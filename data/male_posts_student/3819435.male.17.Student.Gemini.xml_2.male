Then, I was trying to drive home so that I could shower and grab some black socks, but my car ran out of gas at the corner of Marion and 26th (right in front of HyVee). Good thing I have AAA, huh? It was then time for the parent production of  Get Smart . That went really well. I got a lot of laughs, which is a good thing. Well, good night. Take care of yourselves and others. Lots of love!
