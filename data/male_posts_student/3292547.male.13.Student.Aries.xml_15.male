After pluggin the modem back in, and then the router, the internet worked! Wahoo!!  It wasn't too bad as I spent most of the morning watering flowers and getting to page 588 in my book. If you still don't know what book that is, then you are behind and need to catch up on the news =P  I just want to remind everyone that Msg Plus! 3 comes out tommorow! Don't forget to download it from  urlLink here  when it is released at 8AM GMT. The post can be found  urlLink here , or you can go into the archives and read where I posted what it said.  I will have a direct link when it comes out. Foir those of you in Eastern Standard Time (EST) That'll be 3AM. I may or may not be up at that time to post the link, but as always, it should be easier to just get it from there. You can also choose "About" from the Plus menu in MSN Messenger and then choose "Check for updates"
