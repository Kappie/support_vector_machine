So Bobbie and I went for like an hour long walk. That was a lot of fun. Bobbie, if/when you read this, I love you and want to be with you forever. I never thought I could feel this way about someone. I'm going to say what all Bobbie and I talked about and did, but we had some long talks, and yes, we did kiss. All the information I'm going to give out. Alright, I'm gonna go for a bit, I'll post again when I have some free time.  I love you Bobbie.  ~~~~~~My life has been turned into a dream~~~~~~
