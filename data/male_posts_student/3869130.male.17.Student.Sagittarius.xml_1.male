I've wanted to come here for a while so I can go visit people from belleville because I've been away for too long.  I got two of them to come up here (with a little trouble, nice driving ladies!) and we went to see Anchorman.  I enjoyed it because it had Will Ferrel in it but I don't think they had the best of times...Hey, if you wanted to see another film you should've said something... Well, any way I had a good time and I really wasn't sure if i would... It's hard facing someone you've crushed on from years before.  I'm really glad I didn't feel any residual weirdness.       I can't believe Geoff is gone!!! I'm so sad...  Why couldn't we send Pancho to Louisville instead?!! Well, 2 years may not be all that long after all....  Still doesn't make it easy     I hate weddings....well, er, particularly wedding showers that happen to fall on the same date as a LAN party that I really want to attend!!!  Why must the world try to destroy me?     I'm going to put the dreaded post back up and complete it, hopefully, some day... Mainly because I don't want it to be a mark on me...  I know this doesn't mean much to any of you but I'm ok with that.    Anyway, that's all for now  Stephen    //P.S. for you bastards who don't appreciate my blog....Go find a pencil.
