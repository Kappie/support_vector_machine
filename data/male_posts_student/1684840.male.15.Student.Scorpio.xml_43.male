I got loads of pictures, I used up two camera cards, and I made two sections from them, 'Pictures Three' and 'Pictures Four'.  Check them out now!  We went to the Alamo which is this big ancient place (we werent even allowed to touch the walls!)  And I got this cool strobe light keyring and a squashed penny with the building on it.  We then went outside and I had an American snow cone.  It was a cup full of ice they squirt juice on, which was quite refreshing :)  We then spotted the MSNBC news crew going around talking to people and doing reports and stuff (I snook a pic of them when they weren't looking LOL).  When I had finished my icy thingy we all headed off for fudruckers.  It was really cool!  I didn't know you could choose how you wanted your burger cooked, what cheese to put on it and everything!  I just chose a plain ol' hamburger, which did me fine.  We then went on this Riverwalk which was a really nice boat ride down the San Antonio river.  There was loads to see, it was so colourful and the building designs were amazing.  The tour guide said they dye the river green on St. Patrick's day!  We headed back home and that was the end to our cool day :)  Remember to check the Picture Gallery!
