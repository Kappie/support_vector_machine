So last night, Nino, DQ, Kyle (the alpha visitor from our central office) and myself went out to dinner at El Torero (I still prefer Dos, but hey, whatever) and polished off two pitchers of margaritas between Nino, me, and Kyle.  Then we proceed to go back to the Lodge and drink more after exchanging secret santa gifts and sit through the pledge's fireside chat.  So that finishes around 11, so we (now me, Gibbles, Pop, Neal, Gabe, and Kyle) go out to Murphy's (which had a line, mind you...) and drink some more.  Does anyone see where this is going?  So after Murphy's, Gibbles decides we should go to the Silver Bullet.  So we go see some boobies.  I still don't really like strip clubs too much...  Its just such a tease and there are rules, and its awkward, and I feel like I should be a fat bald 40 year old man while sitting and watching these girls do their thing.  It was funny cause Gabe and Gibbles are pretty much regulars and know a few of the girls there.  We decided to please Bill with what is called the "conference call."  All that is, is you tell a stripper to moan into the phone for the guy on the other end and scream his name a few times.  I dunno.  I think Bill enjoyed it, as I think we woke him up for it.  One of the strippers was all over one of the guys, and she was totally in love.  I mean, she told him her real name and she said we should wait for her after she gets out so we can go to a bar.  And so we're like, "ok, sounds great!" then proceed to bolt to our cars and drive off without her.  Yes we are nice like that.  So then we go to Brothers, meet up with the other Lodgers and drink more.  Went home, fell asleep on the couch.  Had fun.  It was a good night, and there is still more stuff to be done this weekend!
