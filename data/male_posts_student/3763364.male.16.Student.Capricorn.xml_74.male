Both sides dropped their weapons and halted, in awe of the free-willed beings. Each side sat in wait to see which opponent humanity would turn to. Eventually, they stopped waiting, and brought the battle to earth. The fight now was over control of humanity. They, alone, would turn the tides of the age-old war.  Are we really just pawns in the game of otherworldly beings?  BA! I've just being plaing to much Diablo. Seriously. At times I see a Devilkin scamper down the hallway. It feels weird, my eyes don't feel like they're there anymore. The world has an intangible, movable quality now.  Break? You say? No. Not a chance.
