We talked about Russia and Napoleon's Penis in Japanese, and I impaled myself on my monologue in Drama. See, this is why I don't try new things, It turns out they're either boring or I'm really bad at them. Carmela! Get me a Vodka Tonic and some lighter fluid. Daddy wants to fly! Yes I'm talking to you, you wayward Cabana Girl. Now Go!   Also I just found out that unemployed sitcom writers wear tweed. Who knew?
