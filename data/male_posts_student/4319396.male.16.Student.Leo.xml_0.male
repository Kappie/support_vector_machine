Got to chapter 6 and Ariuoch's side chapter. I currently have two weapons which i use (only things in my weapon wheel besides Caim's sword).  Deamonbane lv.4 (cool ass sword) Fheng's Glaive lv.2 (cool ass spear thing)  i got to talk with Michelle today, which i do almost everyday, so VWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!  um.. thats all for now XD (im bad at this blogging/journaling thing)  Sudeki
