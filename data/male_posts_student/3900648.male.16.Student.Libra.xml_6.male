My only previous sailing experience was a little bit in scouts, so I chose to enter at the beginner level.  Yesterday they taught us how to rig up our boats, and some of the basic terms and such.  Did you know that the holes the rudder attach to are called gudgeons?    Today we got to start sailing, which was fun.  The advanced-beginners and intermediate sailors left off on some trip through the harbor or something, while my beginner class sat around and discussed tacking.  I learned that tacking specifically refers to a U-turn during which the bow of your boat passes through the eye of the wind.  The opposite would be turning with your stern to the eye--that's called a jive.    So we got out to the water, and rigged up our boats.  They launched a chase boat with an outboard engine to cruise around and help out if any of us happened to capsize (I'm happy to say I didn't).  So after the chase boat was out, half of us were clear to launch our boats and try tacking a figure-eight around a couple of bouys.  Pretty soon I mastered that, as well as avoiding some of my smaller classmates.  I did have a near-spill when I had to swerve to avoid a kid, right when the wind started gusting.  I took on a few gallons of water, but managed to keep from capsizing (yay for bailers!).  So I've talked with the head instructor, and we've decided that tomorrow I'll go with the more advanced group, leaving behind my beginner class.  And if I do well enough I'll be moved up to the bigger boats, the Lasers, by the end of the week.  I must say it is quite a pain tacking when you're kneeling in a floating fiber glass bathtub.  More to come about the sailing class tomorrow.  Oh, and about my modem--my dad went and got a new modem from my ISP today.  Its the same model, but hopefully it'll work for awhile.
