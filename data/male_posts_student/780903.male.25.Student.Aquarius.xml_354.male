I only log on when I have legal research to do.  650 points buys a $10 certificate to your choice of chain stores, like Barnes and Noble and Pizza Hut.  So I've done about $15 of Lexis surfing.  I only have 380 Westlaw points.  That other 1l blogger has 3,005.  I guess I don't do very much legal research.    What a stupid way to make people use your product unnecessarily.  I use these things when I have a reason to, not for free gift certificates.  Is there any good argument for giving away prizes?  I'm going to use Lexis anyway if I need to do legal research.  Nonsense.
