I'm not sure what but in general if something negative seems to be happening it usually is, and it's usually my fault... hm... oh well.  There's a bright golden haze on the meadow... well, there isn't, but today has had much sun. It's been in actuality quite pretty. Very hot though... Gwen was toasted, which is strange, because usually she's the one that doesn't burn. I didn't. So, maybe the sun is liking me a bit atm? Actually, thinking about it, I was outside in sun for a grand total of about 3 minutes... so perhaps that doesn't count? I don't know.  Shez has given me his old mobile, so I have a mobile now... woo, thankyou Shez, you sexy beast. Now I can text people. And when people ask me for my mobile number, I can actually stop saying "Sorry, I don't have one, but I like you a lot, so do you want my home adress?" It has nicht so much ring to it.  Oh, I don't think I said, Becky did email me in the end, thanks to Jack being a star and asking Alex who is a friend of hers. The irony in calling Jack a star is intentional (He was Javert, ie. his main song was Stars). But yeah, he's über-nice and should go out with the woman he wants, name as of yet undisclosed. Cause, you know, him being single simply does NOT work. Anyway, yeah, I have little to nothing to report on the Becky front. We haven't discussed anything, so we haven't had any interesting conversations.  CAYO practice was this morning, which ruled, cause I got to see Jazz and Adele again... tho Jazz isn't going to be there next week *cries*.  Oh, and the NJaN practice got off to a really, really slow start (we had a stand-in drummer, Ben couldn't make it) but after a long break we spent an hour or so just jamming and pretty much came up with 2 songs. Ruleage! The idea for jamming came from Tobin but the riffs came from me. Obviously. Like musical inspiration is going to come from someone else, I'm the most talented man in the world. Here endeth the sarcasm.  Anyway, yes... um... heheh. I've got stuck in that phase of just searching for things to blog about. Yeah, I'm still feeling pretty insecure but I'm not unhappy.  Quote of the day: "Helen, thy beauty is to me   Like those Nicéan banks of yore, That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,   The weary, way-worn wanderer bore   To his own native shore."  From Edgar Allen Poe's   To Helen   Love, Jon Roskilly
