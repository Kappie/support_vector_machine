Yesterday was fun, went on a picnic thing in Beddington Park with Sara, Becca, Amy, someone who I can't remember their name cos I only met them that day, George (who I'm still not convinced actually exists, and also only met that day) Tom and Dave, we played poo sticks with cookies.  But after that we went back to Someone's for a party, it was excellent, lots of people were there, we played the "Tops Off Game" which involved chanting, and everyone with their tops off - as the name suggests. Also I don't recomend mixing tea with alcohol, both are nice, but not together, I am only glad I didn't try the bacartea.   For some reason I also have a new hat, it's black with gold patterns on it, and pink and green little ball-bearings stuck on, and in some places little mirrors. In total I spent about 12 hours out of the house, from 2 to 2, which was nice seeing as it was my kitchen duty day - yeh beat the system. Rock.
