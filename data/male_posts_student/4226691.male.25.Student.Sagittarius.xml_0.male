Well I went to my computer and started playing some songs….one of them being Grandpa “tell me bout the good ol’ days” by the Judds…yes the judds. I do like a handful of Country songs…and I think everyone has to like some country…you can’t just automatically hate every genre without some little inkling of appreciation. Anyway, I was listening to this song, and I thought of my grandpa, of the past, and I was filled with emotion and energy….when I am emotional, I can’t control my self sometimes. I was teary eyed, wondering if I had shamed my grandfather, my ancestors, if I hadn’t taken the right steps through life…how I was such a disappointment. I thought how happy I used to be as a little kid…or so I have been told…and how you lose that shit…why?? I don’t understand it! I hate this… I remember talking with my grandfather a few times, when I was young…he died in 1990. His name was Antonio Sanchez, I have his name as my middle name. I never really knew my other grandpa…he deserted my mom…sort of…I have been told that my family sort of ostracized him…at the time it wasn’t cool to have a birth out of wed-lock…my mom has said that she is a proud bastard. That pisses me off sometimes. Anyway, he would usually sit in his pajamas, drinking a can a beer. He would talk about the past sometimes, though he would usually just watch tv…I guess after so many years, you have this vision of people that isn’t quite what it used to be…but still, he loved us, and he was around, and he was this seemingly strong person…but then cancer came and then he died. It was the first time that I lost someone so close to me. And I was so angry at god….I was only 11 or something…but I was angry. I didn’t have an easy childhood, parents always worked, I was the loner at school, and we couldn’t really have too many friends in my neighborhood---due to gangs and such. But I believed in God, I went to church, I prayed hard, I became an altar boy…I did everything I could think of to insure that God loved me and would look out for me. I believed…. But there was my grandfather, in a coffin, pale, not moving. I had heard a week earlier that he had died at the hospital, and I still remember. We had come home from school, and my parents sat us down, and told me and my brothers about grandpa. I don’t think it sunk in at first. What does that mean? Dead? I guess it didn’t compute. But when I saw him at the funeral home, well it all came back and hit me like a freight truck. I was despondent, I had a number of asthma attacks in the next few days, and to top it all off, I served as an altar boy at his funeral mass. I tried to be strong, but it was too hard. I didn’t believe anymore. I know now that it’s part of life, but it took a long time to get that through my head. But still, I never fully recovered in a fashion, as I didn’t really believe in god anymore. What kind of god would do this? What kind of god would subject a person to this? At the time, I thought these things….that I had been good, that I had tried not to sin, not to hateful to those who were hateful towards me…blah, blah, blah. And yet, I was seemingly rewarded with the death of my grandfather. Now, I know better, that god doesn’t control these things…it’s just life. And I know that my grandfather is not disappointed with me…maybe not that much. Probably too busy watching the Duke on his heavenly tv set. But he does catch a glimpse of my ordeals from time to time…I bet he chuckles with his beer in his hand. Maybe.  for my grandfather...  I remember the life in the spring, in the light with the hopes and the songs that were sang.  I remember the life when the drinks and the food seemed unending, and the laughter went to the dawn.  I remember the life when time was not daunting. To be at one's prime, in the summer, before the twilight...  As the geometry of shadows nestle the fading candelight, the enfolding night embraces my memory.  But like a star's cry, I am vigilant, if apt to reflection, and I remember the life I once led.  p.s. T, sorry that my blogs on Myspace and here are the same now...it just seemed easier...maybe I should try to divide up my blog space...one topic here and one topic there....we shall see.
