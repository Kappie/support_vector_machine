But I guess that it happens to all of us sometimes, and while most people actually vent these feelings to other people when they come up - well, I pretty much just talk to myself and jettison them into cyberspace (i.e. write them here).  You know, I've come to realize in the last couple of days that I really have nothing that I admire about myself, nothing that if someone came up to me and asked, "What are you especially good at or what quality do you think you're especially strong in?", I could give them an honest answer and feel that I actually was strong in that area.  I daresay that anyone has ever described me as "fun" or "outgoing," least of all myself.  I'm hardly handsome or dashing, especially lately.  I'm certainly not a sociable person or someone who even makes decent conversation.  I'm not really all that bright (something becoming more and more clear to me), and what I think I do know I usually don't.  I'm not especially caring or loving, don't have a significant amount of empathy or selfless concern.  I'm not very attentive or outgoing.  I'm certainly not very wise or discerning, at least not in ways that are practically useful, and I can never seem to find the right thing to say at the right time.  I'm not really very eloquent, don't seem to be able to fully grasp what people are saying all the time, and I'm not really a very good listener.  I don't make friends easily, don't take charge of situations very often (and I don't lead very well), don't plan things well when I do think of something, and don't tend to be the best follower, either.  I'm not an especially hard worker, don't think of the most efficient ways of doing things, and am not especially strong in my morals, beliefs, or convictions (what few there may be).  And I'm not confrontational in the least, so whatever "beliefs" or "convictions" I might have are solely my own and not something that I would ever share with anyone (which makes for a very frustrating worldview).    So I guess things are looking (and feeling) a little bleak right now.  Some people might say that there isn't anywhere to go but up, but those people have never gotten in a position where there doesn't really seem to be any motivation to do so.  I guess the best summary of things is that I'm miserable and wallowing in it; I know that the right thing to do is to snap out of this and try to change things, but I just don't seem to have the heart, interest, or energy to do so right now.  Call me defeatist, depressing, or just a downright loser, but that's the way things seem right now.  I mean, what do I have to look forward to?  Law school?  From what I've heard, it ain't exactly one big party.  So what else?  Sad as it might seem, nothing else comes to mind - I don't really have any close friends (daresay a "significant other!"), don't have any significant projects or hobbies to distract me, don't have a job that I can try to bury all of this by working a lot.  I've heard that some people become "gym rats" and just work out all the time - that's an option, but I've never really gotten into the whole working-out thing (even when I was playing sports).  And besides, I know in the long run none of these things will dull this void in my spirit or emotions or id or whatever you want to call it, the void created by a lacking of people and beliefs in my life.  One of the things that I've always believed is that people and relationships are the most important things in life, but my utter paucity of them feels like a crushing condemnation of my own hypocrisy.  Right now my mind, my emotions, and my spirit are all crying out for something, for a real touch from someone or something, for someone to tell me or for me to realize that I actually matter in the grand scheme of things, but I have no idea where any of that is going to come from...
