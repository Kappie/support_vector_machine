Low and behold, Computer Man (aka Joe) came to the rescue and saved my computer.  Many thanks go to Mr. Scoffinger. Pity that the man isn't using these valuable skills more.  Just a thought.  Much has gone on since the last post.  I'll try to parcel it out as to not overwhelm anyone.  So, here's a starter:  As rumour has it, a certain Filipino bartender we all know and love is going to be going to the river with a certain young Monrovia police officer.  Now, I don't know nothing about nothing, but word on the street says that perhaps a marriage proposal is in the works.  We shall wait and see.  Oh, imagine the children....what a site that will be......
