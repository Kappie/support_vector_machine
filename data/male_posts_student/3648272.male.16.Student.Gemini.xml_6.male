Yes, at 6:30 i did wake up and go to the gym for an aerobic workout...2.5 mile jog on treadmill (w/ incline ofcourse) and 10 mins on the bicycle. It was tough as hell but worth it. I felt energetic for the rest of the day. I guess workin out in the morning kind of temporarely boosts your metabolism for a short time.   Anyway, after that I decided to relax. I went out for a little while but it was really hot, so I ended up staying in most of the day.  God, I can't wait till the pool opens (which is tomorrow btw)  I spent most of the day at home. Fuckin weather was brutal. I was watching "007 Die another Day". Not a bad movie at all, and that's comming from someone who really doesn't like James Bond. Afterwards, I loaded like 50 more songs into my ipod...took me like an hour to sort everything out.  At 9:00 PM, I went back to the gym to lift weights and do my usual ab workout. It was pretty intense, but like the morning jog, it was worth it.  Anyway...that was my day. Nothing special. One issue that I want to address though is Lies, scams, and deceptions. This has really been bothering me lately. I feel like people are continously lieing to me, telling me half-truths, or trying to deceive me. And what's worse is that I keep catching them at it and they still refuse to come clean. I'm going to conclude this post by giving everyone some friendly advice, ALWAYS WATCH OUT FOR SCAMS AND DECEPTION. You'de be surprised just how many people will lie to you in a given day, and it may come from people that you already know. No one is who they appear to be. That's it for now. Take care and tune in tomorrow for another post. Same time, same channel.
