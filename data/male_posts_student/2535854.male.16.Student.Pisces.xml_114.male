Ok I admit I left home late for school,but when I got there..everyone who was like late ekan tahan by the prefects..but we werent getting fined.They just said that we wait there so we can like go to assembly at the same time as all the other students so Datin tak marah...stupid..and Cheryl was there to and said she left her bag in her car...haha..sounds brilliant to me!And at assembly was at the back with Lingesht and Idzmil who was also with me kena tahan by prefects..haha...and they gave some crap to those fellas that were at Sukma and Cheryl was angry all she didnt get any recognision although she was there!I guess I was surprised as well but what to do..dumb school :p.  Ok I passed out an undone Compo 1 exercise book with idzmil and Zainul which means we`ll die..blgh.....ok ill fast foward though the oring school hours >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...  Then after school was talking to Alia and Zia and like those guys called or referred to as 'the twins' that are from Cempaka are actually from Cempaka Cheras...their names are Shaznin and Shazli or something..appearently the word 'cute' and 'hot' or something are associated with them by girls there so seem to be following them all over!But according to Alia,they aren`t cute and are dumb!haha..And she says they are like 'posers'.But a different version.A version of a poser except that they are nerdy and geeky looking fags with their pants pulled up to immpossable heights!Haha!So I told Yii Ping and she was like maybe were just jealous and I told her that girls said that and shes like 'aiks!'.haha...  Then had to go to Ampang and pick up mom and dad from the doctors palce since its my moms monthly check-up cause she has high blood pressure and stuff now...So it took like fucking long to get there!Jammed like crap...500 meters away oso can take like 15 minutes to get to!Anyway picked em up and avoided the jams and went back through Damansara..  my brother Jal came..and brought lotta stuff from grandma`s house in Taiping..and had nasi briyani for dinner..heh...the paper thats used to bungkus the nasi briyani plastic packet had the thing about the YKLS singing that Rodgers and Hammerstien..was thinking about finding Cheryl in the picture..and I think I found her and conteng her :P :P :P.Lmao.Decided dinner sounds better.Lmao.Oh yeah it was the Malay Mail even..now what date I dunno..maybe i`ll put it up later...
