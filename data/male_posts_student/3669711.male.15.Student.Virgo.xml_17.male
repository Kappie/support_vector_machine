It was a good movie, althought i wasn't as enthralled with it as the previous Bourne Identity.  It was good, but it wasn't that good.   One of the things that didn't make it as good: very little dialogue.  The story was mostly Bourne running away from an enemy that he didn't know about, for a crime he didn't commit.  Thats all i can say without spoiling it for you.  As i said previous, it was good, but not that good.      Another fun thing was that i got to play and borrow Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes for the Gamecube.  Now thats a fun game ^_^  Gotta love solid snake, and his cool matrix moves.  And you also have to love that he knocks guys out when he rolls into them ^_^ Great for tight spots.    Well, thats all i can say for now, my mind has gone blank!    Lates
