The places that interest me most are   Starbucks  Aunty Anne`s Pretzel`s  Cinnabon  Nando`s  Laksa Shack..err ewww?   Other than that, theres a Toys R` Us, some grocery store which looks better than TMC, some Organics food store, buncha nice looking and likely not the cheapest restaurants...and MPH is soon to open but it`s storelot seems to be very small...unless its deep..doubt so...The Starbucks there is damn nice...not any places outside considerably yet, but there`s sofas near the windows and all...quite nice...I wonder what else will open up there..  Err tuition was fine. I little mind-boggled here but i`m A-o-kay! haha..Anyway I grabbed a arlic and also a Cinnamon Pretzel at Auntie Anne`s Pretzels and a Apple Bean with whip cream Frapp at Starbucks..quite nice..maybe a little sweeter and it would be nicer..along with a bit more apple essence...ya think..Anyway i`m gonna charge everything to my dad...nyeh nyeh!  Oooo I love Sarah`s new tetsi on me!I`m actually missed by people? Amazing!
