Damn Canuks, they need to be a little more creative than "lightning", 'sides they were blaming the ConEd station on 14th, when it was only responding to the sudden lack of electricity!  I dunno Conrad dude, I wasn't listening to that 1010, I know better, the shit is, no other station could quite wrap around their heads just how to report, relying on Washington's PR for transmission space.  But I just loved it, it was so dark, it was great.  I insisted on shutting the door in my room and staying in total darkness, from the time the sun set to the time I fell unconsious, only to awaken the next morning in a haphazard position, clothes and hair in disarray. Kinda like a big hangover, 'cept without all the vomiting and the three strange women, all to whom I am now married to... All the while I blasted the greatest music on my mp3 player, having hooked it up to some comp speakers, and maxing out the volume.  I was very eager to go outside though, as soon as I heard about the black out, who knows how many old folks might need some help up dark stairs? Or were dehydrated? How 'bout people stuck in elevators? Or the subways? Man seriously, but my mother wouldn't let me out, said sumthin' about me looting.  That's another thing I wanted to go out and kick some looter ass, I've got no remorse, or regard for my own safety, might as well put my pathetic ass to some good use and help out.  I can handle most handguns, some knifes and such! Let me do SOMETHING, but I could settle for dark solitary confinement with some Iggy Pop blasting...yeah...  I'm Deadinside and that all for today.  "I hope you'll love this song just as much as I do, listening to it in total darkness..."
