Post problems that ordinary computer users encounter are just COMMON SENSE problems.  They DON'T REQUIRE THOUGHT.  Example -  Why can't I see video?   You don't have a video card!   Ok, well, maybe not that simple, but you get the idea.  Another problem that I have seen is when people have the information they need, but they have NO IDEA how to apply it.  Example -  I know what drivers are, I also know that they are usally required for hardware to make them work (allow my computer to see them).  Why won't my printer work!??!?!  I plugged everything in, but it won't print .  Again, not THAT simple, but you get the idea.  I'ts almost impossible to get people to understand.  It's like they can't even hear you.  Then, when they DO ask for your help, they won't LISTEN to your advice.  HELLO??? ARE YOU THERE? - yes like that.  I don't understand.  From now on, if I'm at someone's house working on their computer, if for just ONE SECOND they don't listen to my advice, I'm walking straight out the door.  Even if that means leaving them stranded with a screwed up computer...  I'm just sick of it.   urlLink This  describes my pain perrrrfectly.  From now on, my only clients (even if I don't make a profit from my work) will be people who are WILLING TO LISTEN.
