Cottonwood High forces a fluent-English speaking latino student into ESL classes -  http://www.sltrib.com/2004/May/05172004/utah/167365.asp   While they're at the "English Only" movement, why not adopt a similar "White culture is superior initiative" or "Latinos are equal when they learn our language" policy?  Both (like English Only) without any substantive effect on actual law or regulation.  Just you know....to make it "officially" clear.  Then they can justify it (like English Only) by explaining that they're trying to help the minority cultures become more...well...like them.  Right.
