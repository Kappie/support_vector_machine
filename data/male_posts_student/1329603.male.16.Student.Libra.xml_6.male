Marcus' blog is beginning to annoy me, apart from him going on about losing Sam which is about as likely as me getting her back, his constant pessimism makes it a lot harder for me to be optimistic! Arghifarghy.  I don't know whether it's rebound but I'm beginning to fancy some of the people I thought were just friendly before... I'm not going to make any moves while I'm not sure. Actually, I'm probably using it as an excuse, because I am on the whole a complete coward. In the movies where the people go for a wonderful adventure, I'd be the bloke who was thrilled with the idea but when it came to it ran off crying.  Love, Jon Roskilly
