We were supposed to do work, but we just laid on blankets on the ground and talked and slept. lol. we had hotdogs, hamburgers, baked beans, and stawberry shortcake to eat. there was also elvis, and garth brooks impersonators. it was HILLARIOUS! the best part of the whole day is that we got out of school for a day. I got a little sun burn too. well i g2g because my sister needs to use the computer. cya all later!
