You’re finishing school.   Duh .  I don’t want to be this person forever; my face will change before you know it.    Waltzing above conversations, I overheard the question, “Where do you see yourself doing, how old, when you die?”  75 years, in my death bed.   Crazy .  Road loadin’, tomorrow.   Pft, you should’ve road loaded long ago.  You ugly .   I don’t see myself living past tonight.  That’s how I see things.  It’s all about here and now, and if not, well it’s obviously in the past or future, and there’s not much I can do about that.  Let me define “future.”  The future is college and an ultimate career, settling down, and smoking marijuana without a sack of guilt; according to the “big picture” folks.  When you look at your mother and go “I told you,” After all those long years, “I’m not a failure.”  You welcome the long anticipated expression, the one given so many times before.  You know the “you go first” look in a long line to jump off of a cliff.   Me?  Right now, yes the me right now; the future is this week-end.  Will I have a job?  Will I finish school?  Of-fucking-course.  Will I have a good time doing it?  Of-fucking-course.
