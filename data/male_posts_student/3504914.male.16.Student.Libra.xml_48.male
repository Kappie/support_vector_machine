Im the type to do things at the last minute, for example assignments, essays etc. Also i cant seem to study, and by the time i have a test i fuck it up. How can i change my attitude towards studying and doing assignments before the due date.   __________    Aw, I hate serious questions like this, but I guess I will try to do my best to answer this. Let’s start.      You claim to be a smart person, and lazy. This is actually a major problem with smart people, they feel they don’t need to study shit because they’re smarter than everybody else, and therefore studying would, technically, be degrading.         Now, there are two approaches I can think of approaching this with, neither can I assure will work (Because for each individual there is a different solution, and nobody can give one single cure that will work for all, blah blah blah, so you have to adapt what other people say to fit yourself)       First Approach     Think of all the negative aspects of your life. This may seem highly stupid advice which a pale-faced Goth would adhere to, but by doing this you automatically cancel out the whole smart thing. But don’t do this until you get depressed, we don’t need any more idiots dragging themselves around. Anyway, after this effort at being more realistic in your outlook on life, you will find that no matter how smart you are, it’s usually the people who work hard who end up reaping benefits. I can think of a few people who aren’t smart, so to say, but they’re a hell of a lot better than me regardless.      So yes, simply put, think of all the things that you don’t know about, and try to put an effort into the things you DO know about to make up for your lack of knowledge in particular fields.        Second Approach      I don’t know where you are in life, but when you say studying I’m put in mind of high school and university. If you’re in the former, my advice is to simply think about aiming your highest so you can get into a good uni. If you’re in uni, think about what you want to become. Doctor? Well like fuck a hospital will hire somebody inefficient like you when there are plenty of other choices.      The short-term pleasure of not doing stuff because you’re lazy is worth fuck all in the long run, where you’ll be walking around begging for cash. Whereas though you don’t get to lounge around right now, you can become rich later on and spend your time as lavishly as you want then.      So which would you rather be? A young bloke/dame who does nothing and enjoys it right now, or a slightly older man/woman who cruises the seven seas in search of BOOTY! In either sense, I guess xD  __________________      Alas, my headache prevents me from thinking more at the current time, so will that do?
