The string whipped around, hit my left arm, and left a nice thin red curved mark from my wrist halfway to my elbow. I guess what bothers me isn't so much that the string broke or that a part of my arm stings like hell though, but that now I have to go out and buy new strings. This is like the third set of strings I've gone through in a month and a half. It's ridiculous. And on top of that, I'm probably not gonna be able to get a ride to Guitar Center for like a week. Sigh.  Anyway, enough of my whining. Check this out (Pete sent it to me):  urlLink The American People Ruled Unfit to Govern   That is all.         -- Feanor
