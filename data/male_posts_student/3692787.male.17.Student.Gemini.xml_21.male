UR IN73LL3CT SUX0RZ. MY IN73LL3C7 PWNS. PH34R MY IN73LL3C7. PH34R TEH L337 T34CH0RZ.  yeesh. my inevitable destiny as a pathetic math major is unravelling right before my eyes. the cosmos damn well better grant me control over, say, a friggin' island or something, or at the very least guide me towards finding me "only one" soon...  completely wrong thought of the day: today's thought was partially discussed while sitting down somewhere in AS. thanks again  urlLink Jam.   boy a and girl b are sharing a nice day together on a bench overlooking a huge green field. both a and b are enjoying the day together. they watch a butterfly fly up in front of them, and silently they accept it as a symbol of their beautiful relationship.  now, jam and i were mutually pissed at different things, and we were feeling kinda trippy. jam clutched the butterfly in her hand and squeezed the life out of it, and i imitated the butterfly's high-pitched insect voice screaming, "nooo! nooo! don't kill me! i don't want to diiieee!!!" jam can only mutter "i hate butterflies!" through her clenched teeth of rage, while i laugh psychotically after finishing my lines. soon, jam joins me, and we both laugh like psychos while a and b run for their lives...
