It was quite an interesting vacation!Our car broke down on the waydown there. LoL We had to get a towtruck and everything. Then we were stranded at our hotel/condothing and we had to drive this"Dune Buggy" thing around.. it was like an extra long golf cart. It was hilarious. We went shopping....hung out on the beach... in the pool... watched the fireworks on the 4th... it was a lot of fun. I bought Mikey a little guitar thingy..I know what is' called but I don't know if I can spell it. LoL AUkalayle...lol noclue. Maybe one day when I figure out how to put up pictures on here I'll show ya. LoL Well 4 days after I got home from that I left again for Fort Worth for another 3 day activity. It was a Youth Conference. Something my Church holds every summer. It was definately fun. More fun than all the ones I've been to before! Well, things are going good here.  Mikey and I are still great. I love him so much... and it's not just the lustful boyfriend/girlfriend type.. it's the best friend, no1 else like him love. :) I'm so grateful for him.   Well I need to start working out... running and stuff. If I don't, I am going to DIE in two-a-days. LoL They are just around the corner too! Our new coach, Coach Libby, had a couple of practices with us the other day. It was tiring, but it felt good to run and stuff. He's definately gonna keep us running and in shape for basketball and volleyball.   Well, the other day I was talking with one of my friends from Fort Worth, he's going to BYU.. that's where I have always wanted to go. I think about leaving right after school's out though, and it scares me. I don't wanna leave Cathryne and Nathan yet, they're still young! I wanna go to their basketball and volleyball games and their trackmeets. And my parents, it'd kill me to not have them around anymore! LoL So I think I'll stick around for awhile. :)   I think I'm gonna go! Gotta get some stuff done today, maybe even some running! I've got volleyball games tonight at the G. Highschool! Ne1 who's interested needs to come watch! LoL AdIoS! ~ChRiStIn
