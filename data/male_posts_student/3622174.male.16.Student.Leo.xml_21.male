The news came at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in May. Magazines stopped the press to include this story in their next issues. Websites were flooded with screens and traffic regarding the game. But, not too much was revealed about this new game from Zelda's mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto when it was first announced.    When Nintendo originally said that a new Zelda game would be available in 2004, they also had stated that it would share the same graphical style as the previous game in the Zelda series, The Wind Waker. The Wind Waker featured a new, cartoony graphic style that was hailed as controversial to the gaming public, and was not popular amongst some gamers. Through it all, the game turned out to be one of the best Zelda games in the series, and now, they are looking to set the standard even higher with this new title.    Well, Nintendo lied about two things when they announced "Wind Waker 2" back in 2003. First off, this game does not feature the cartoon style graphics like they said it would. They took the graphic style that was shown at a Nintendo event back in the year 2000 for a GameCube technical demo, and they made it into one of the most impressive looking games that will be released on the system. Yes, even better looking than Metroid. They also lied when they said it would be out by the end of 2004. Hate to break it to you, Zelda fans, but, you're gonna have to wait until Spring 2005 to play this one. They expect to have the game playable at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May of 2005.    Many of the screens that Nintendo released to the gaming press when the game was announced suggested that there is a war going on in the land of Hyrule this time around. Link is much more mature in this installment of the game. In "The Wind Waker," he was the child Link that we see sometimes. In this new game, he looks about 17. That's a big step up for only a 2 year difference between games. Anyway, massive amounts of enemies were shown, in a formation that makes you think that the game might take place during a war. One of the big changes is that it looks like you can ride your horse, Epona, as well as attack enemies at the same time, a big feature that was missed out on in Ocarina of Time, which was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998.    This game looks to be incredibly promising. The graphics look outstanding, and even though we don't know anything confirmed about its story, its gameplay, or anything else that doesn't deal with graphics, I do know for sure that this will be the GameCube title to own when it releases in 2005. Be ready, because the unexpected may be coming in 2005.    Tomorrow on Digital Lust, I've got two Photoshop tricks for you, and then something else before I head off to Orlando for the week. Remember, I am looking for people to fill in for me and post whatever they want regarding gaming and technology. See the post below for more details. I need people by tomorrow, if at all possible, so that they can start early Monday morning.    Digital Lust will officially relaunch on August 9th, 2004, if you haven't heard. The format will be similar to this, plus a mix of the other stuff that you've gotten used to over the past few weeks. I'm going to be taking more of a focus on videogames, since that seems to be incredibly popular in the search engines (we went from 30-something hits to 65 in a day, and it was all for searches on Spiderman 2...its incredible!). I want Digital Lust to be a success, and based on the past couple days, I would say that it can happen. I'll see you tomorrow, here on Digital Lust, for a special Sunday update. Remember, until I return here tomorrow, you can check out Blog of Bagel by going to  urlLink http://bagel05.blogspot.com  for my nightly posts. I've been posting a lot of interesting things around there, including the new "Nerdular Nerdance" monthly column, and this month, it's on Yearbook Camp, where I'm heading to on Monday. Also there include the Late Night Bloggin' segment, where I go through Blogger, find some interesting blogs, and talk about them, either praising them, or making fun of them. And, of course, I post other things there too. It's all from the coolest nerd you'll ever know! See ya!
