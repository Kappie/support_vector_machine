It pleases me that people actually leave comments in here...specially rachel..and luke? good seening you man, but did i tell you about this? good snoopin! im proud.   i spent the remainder of my time untill now just going absolutely NUTS on the drums. sounded about as good as dying fish, but twar fun! yeah anyway its realyl hot here. meh. i miss people. at least luke comes soon...and your right, she said gihugic just the other day.
