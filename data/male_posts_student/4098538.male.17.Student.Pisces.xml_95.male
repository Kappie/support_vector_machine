Hey you, you're livin' life full throttle.   Hey you, pass me down that bottle.   Hey you, you can't shake me around now.   I get so lost and don't know how.   It hurts to care. I'm going down.      Forgot my woman, lost my friends.   Things I've done and where I've been.   Sleep in sweat - the mirror's cold.   See my face - it's growin' old.   Scared to death - no reason why.   Do whatever to get me by.   Think about the things I said.   Read the page - it's cold and dead.      Take me home...
