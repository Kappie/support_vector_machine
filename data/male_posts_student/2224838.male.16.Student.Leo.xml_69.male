Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.  -Alexander Pope     urlLink  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   shows the significance of memories in life through an unlikely couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), and their experiences with trying to erase their relationship from existence. I've already mentioned this movie a few times in recent posts, but tonight I was able to go see it for myself. The story is told, not in chronological order, but through an assortment of memories in no particular order at all. As Joel quickly loses every last memory of his relationship with Clementine, he rediscovers his passion for her and desperately tries to hide some fragment of her in the recesses of his mind. "Eternal Sunshine" is a collaboration of both Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, who together create an awesome story and visual experience. It is another great dramatic role for Jim Carrey, just as in  urlLink  The Majestic  , which many people overlook. This is just one of those movies that gets caught in your mind, rolling around and producing new questions, which in my opinion, makes it great.
