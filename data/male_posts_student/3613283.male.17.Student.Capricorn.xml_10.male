Oh no!  I am pretty sick of Saudi Arabia  and its thousands of Princes. Prince Bandar and the spokesman...hum...Adel? They're  hypocrits . I just can't stand them. Kids are taught that Westerners (Jews, Christians...) are  pigs who must rot in hell  and then they want to make friends? Oh no thanks!   Saudi Arabia is America's biggest enemy . After all, most of the hijackers of 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is a Saudi. The police forces there work for the gov't during the day, and at night, they put on their terrorist outfit. Let me tell you, there will come a time when the U.S. administration won't have to obey Saudi Arabia anymore and we'll smash them like a bug. Yes, they're the free world's biggest enemy. We just can't say it. Yeah, there's oil so  sshhh .  Don't ask, don't tell. Get it?
