We keep drinking and drinking and so by the time McKay shows up I am drunk and I get some Pizza and then we roll to the after party.  Well this after party is free beer and wine and shit so I'm drinking a beer and talking to people when I see this girl trying to open a bottle of wine with a knife.  I go over to help her open it.  We start shotting the shit and it turns out she's from Austin, so were talkin' Texas music and some stuff like that..  and then some dude comes and snags the bottle or whatever and I'm out of beer at this point so I say goodbye and go to get another beer.  As I'm walking away the guy who's place it is, I met earlier, Snags me and asks me if I knew who I was talking to.  I said Yeah, Barbara from Texas.  He was like Barbara Bush..  I said, "Thats a wierd name."  He said, "Thats the Presidents daughter."  So that was the story of me kicking it with the presidents daughter..  Tha is just one of the many stories from Yale..  The others soon to come..  "Zeke eat's soul food in harlem"  "Zeke Threatening Rich Kids with  a Bowie KNife"..
