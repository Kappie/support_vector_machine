I'm gonna try and get some people to play DDR tonight.  I'll just beat the ever loving crap out of them though, so I'm bringing 1st through 3rd Korean Mix in.  After that its the obligitory Bingo with prizes, and then getting wasted...(on my own time of course)...Mainly DDR though.  I'm actually pretty good at it now.  Especially since I practice on a softpad, which is harder than hell to play on.  Anyways, I wish you all a Happy New Year, and seriously, don't drive while drunk.  It's not cool.  If you do get drunk, don't drive.  Well, its been a great year, here's hoping for another great year! (and my website lasting that long too)
