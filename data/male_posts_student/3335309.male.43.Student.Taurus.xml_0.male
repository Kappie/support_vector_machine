It was he who told me during my freshman year, "Bill, there's nothing worse than a bad blowjob."  At the time I nodded in agreement, imagining that what he said was probably true.  Of course, I had nothing to offer on the subject at that time since my experience was limited.  You could say my experience was nil.  As the years passed and my sexual adventures increased, I came to agree with Randy.  But today ...  I can honestly say that there  is  something worse than a bad blowjob.  A bad massage.  It was horrible.  Beyond terrible.  It was dismal.  I felt like I was getting manhandled by an egg beater.  I got  on  the table a little tight and got off more stressed out than before.  I felt cheap and dirty and cheated.  Yet another of life's sacred pleasures ruined by a beast.
