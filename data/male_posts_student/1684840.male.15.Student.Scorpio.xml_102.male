Woke up to loads of sunshine (how can you not be happy on a sunny day?!) and eat breakfast etc.  At school we had the english exam (didn't like it that much but I tried my best!).  We had a cool english lesson; we all did a quiz because it didn't make sense to do an english lession straight after a 1:45 long english exam!  The weather is fantastic.  The sky is totally clear now and stars from all around are visible :D  Just finished playing Minesweeper flags with becx, gonna go have a shower and get an early night now... cya!
