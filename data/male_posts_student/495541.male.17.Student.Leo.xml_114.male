It's a Audi TT roadster.  It's excellent.  It was a diecast model you put together.  Real nice.  I put it together in a couple minutes and it's now sitting on my desk.  :-)  I wish I had a real TT though.  It would be wicked nice.  Also bought some network cables.  Our home network is now complete.  I hooked my Mom's old computer up with Windows 2000 a couple weeks ago.  I put my old 20 GB hard drive in it and we're now using it as a nice file server that all the computers in the house have access to.  That way I can put my MP3s up on it and everyone can listen to them.  I just wish I had network access in my room.  I don't.  Too bad.  Anyways that's about all I did today.  Peace out.
