Eerie in that David being a machine was so artificial, annoying, and scary in his displays of affection, yet you couldn't help but feel bad for him. I think the movie speaks a load about the human condition, in that so often we desire that thing called love, which is something we can't control. It's because it is something that is so tied to our sense of self. That is the things that we love define who we are and what we do with our lives. For David it was the search for reciprocated love from his mother. However, I couldn't get over the conclusion of the film and realize that David is still just a machine and his mother isn't real at that point (that is unless the aliens changed him, as he was crying in the end).   I spent most of the day today on campus downloading and I checked out the Lynn Spigel book on TV and the American family. I need to read the Rodney book seeing as how I need to present on it on Monday. Man... so much to do, so little time.  I think I'm going to stop buying that Walmart honey bbq chicken. It always seems like the first one is good, and each progressing thigh is worse. I dunno.   ***
