If there's something you find notable about law school that I haven't written a song about,  urlLink E-mail me  and I'll try to write something and post it.  2. If there's any questions about law school you'd like me to answer in my weblog, also  urlLink E-mail me  and I'll try my best.  Just figured I'd see what would happen if I ask my readers for ideas... :)  Also... I feel sort of obligated to post something -- or at least feel something, even if I weren't going to post it -- about the impending war , but, really I really have nothing to say.  I feel bad that I have no strong feelings going through my head, especially since it seems like everyone in law school has strong feelings about everything, but what can I do...  And, finally for right now... maybe if I link to this pre-law information site called urlLink  JD2B  , they'll finally know I exist.  Usually I'm cool with just getting discovered by whoever discovers me, but pretty much all of the other law school weblogs I know of are listed on their page, but not me.  Maybe the guy in charge of it read my weblog and decided he didn't like it.  Oh well.
