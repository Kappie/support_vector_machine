Good thing i've got the this or there would have been alot of trepidation about Uni cos ABCD is quite different to BBBB but I got in. It's quite weird because Downey ended up with 1 higher more than me and they knocked him back. Plus my personal statement was utter pish. Young Michael passed everything he got a C for advanced english which i must appluad the man for and getting an A in crash modies. i don't know what to think now Uni is cool cos well it's uni, going into Glasgow everyday real stuff and all that but.......... its further away and that means getting up earlier and I will probably have to give up that job before i even start it, plus Glasgow will get boring, and Uni will be alot harder than college woulda been, and architectural technology sounds well better than Arts n Social Sciences, that I'll be doing. But I am the first of my bretheren to go to uni so it is still a good badge of honour hahaha. So now young Michael is going to Glasgow to do English Literature, downey is going into clearing and will go to Cally probably, i am gonna do Arts n Social Sciences, apart from that I canny remember what alot of people are doin, Lisa n Pauline are also goin to the old Strathy, but so's a certain poofy fuckin wanker see another drawback. And Mr Mcallister that was doing everything the same as me had a bit of an appocalypse partly cos of me probably, i wrote that i put him off in geography and he failed it, no even one of these new fangled D's and I got an A so i extend my sympathies to him and Willhamima of course. See these pricks on tv, "Ooooh i got 4A's and a B I'm quite disappointed" pr1cks don't know how lucky they are.
