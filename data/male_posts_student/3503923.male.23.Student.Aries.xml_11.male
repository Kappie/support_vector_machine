A score of two from a perfect ten may entice you to sit down, watch and find out; what warranted even those two fingers to stay up. It may misleadingly convey that there is some merits to the movie. The ‘five shining stars’ scoring system, may be more effective in communication the abject failure of the entire movie. There would be four dull stars, and the fifth only partially illuminated, just enough to make you laugh at it for trying to be a star.  Bill Murray starred, very faintly, a bushel obstructing any light that would normally radiate from his stage presence. The bushel in this instance being a weak script and amateurish directing by Sophie Coppola. Her father’s advice about skilful movie making was obviously left spinning at the airport carrousel in Tokyo, leaving her with a lost cast, hopelessly attempting to salvage something of worth from a project doomed for failure.  Was it really that bad? The movie begins with an elongated still shot of a woman wearing underpants, lying in bed, motionless. The next couple of scenes also feature the underpants, or a woman cavorting in these underpants. The subliminal message of these early scenes becomes apparent when the finishing credits begin to roll, and you realise that punch line would never be delivered.  Bill Murray, a struggling Hollywood movie star, goes to Japan for an easy payday. While out there, he works on a few commercials, sipping on Ice-T, while a crazy Japanese cameraman snaps away, all the while, making sure that Bill’s facial expressions speak of the luxury of the ‘whiskey’ he’s enjoying. He also appears on a talk-show with Japan’s equivalent of Graham Norton –suited in garish pink. Murray comes to a point of career break-down ushered in by his mid-life crisis involving nights out dressed in orange shirts.  Bill can’t sleep at night; he roams the hotel at 3a.m in the morning, meets a red-head in the bar, or a woman by the pool. He rings his wife back in America, assuring her everything is fine, proceeding to have two casual relationships with women of the night. That is the whole plot in its entirety. No message of hope. The movie insinuates that during mid-life crisis when your career is experiencing a dip, you can travel abroad, and engage in some harmless fun. The movie positively encourages it, while trying to disguise it with airy-fairy philosophies, exotic romance, and the artiness of a smoky jazz-bar.  Verdict: Underpants.
