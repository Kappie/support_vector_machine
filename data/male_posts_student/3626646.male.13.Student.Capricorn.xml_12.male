"Vroom, vroom," the noise said.      I ran out of the kitchen and into the living room.  I looked out the window only to find a car that had stopped right beside our mailbox.   I figured that he was either    A) Stealing the mail    B) Giving us a pipe bomb or C) Asking for directions   I settled on A) finally and decided to figure out who it was.  I grabbed my handy dandy binoculars and had a closer look.   It was a red car.  It was sort of beaten up.  But, I knew exactly who it was when I saw the sign on top of his car.  The sign, of course, said MAIL.       It was the MAILMAN!!!  I couldn't believe it!  The mailman was stealing our mail!!   I quickly ran outside (with no shirt on) and ran up to the mailbox.  About half way up, he must have saw me and got scared because he drove away.   When I got there I realized that I had noticed him just in time.  I must have scared him just in time because he didn't have time to steal the mail.  I had scared him away before he even had time to  take anything.  The mail was in the mailbox!      So I grabbed the mail and ran back inside.  I then refreshed myself with a nice glass of water.     I felt a feeling that was so inexplicable that it was great.   The day had been saved (yet again) by JUSTIN KLINE!!!
