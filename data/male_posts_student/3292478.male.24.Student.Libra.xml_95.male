I was expecting to hear whether I was through on Friday 18th June by letter and so put it to the back of my mind. Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon the phone rings, expecting it to be my mum or my brother I answered with a lazy sunday " Yo ", only to hear the voice of the Lincolnshire Probation Service co-ordinator telling me I was through! Glad they weren't testing my telephone skills!!  Next interview is  Tuesday 13th July ! Got a presentation to plan for that in the meantime, so updates as and when required!!
