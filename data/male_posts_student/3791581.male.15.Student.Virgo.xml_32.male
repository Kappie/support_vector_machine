I can hear your conversations and she sounds like a very smart girl!"  On a sidenote, we play "I-Spy" during our walks.   I've been a stay-at-home mother for 5 years and this job is usually thankless.  Not that I expect the thanks and recognition, but it just feels nice to know that I've been doing something right along the way.
