Patti and I will be picking up the new tiles for the bathroom floors and also replacing the curtains on the door to the backyard. The guy who fixed the upstairs carpet (and put in the new carpet border downstairs) tore the curtains! We may be changing the tiles for the downstairs bathroom to something stronger and nicer, but we'll decide that when we get there.
