Every year my grandparents have a Barbeque at their house in Garden Grove,light off Chinatowns worth of fireworks out on their street, then walk down the street aways and watch the fireworks from Disneyland. Its always a hell of a time, and this is the first year ive really been able to invite people. Lots and lots of food, my oddball extended family and old movies. Nothing better. If anyones interested just give me a call on my cell phone or leave a comment. Hope everyone can make it. =)
