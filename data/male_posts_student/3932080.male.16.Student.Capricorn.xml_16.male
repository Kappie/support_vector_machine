This year,  Outkast's  "Hey Ya" and "The Way You Move" were both on their last legs after dominating radio airplay for weeks,  Eamon's  neo-soul of "F*ck It" was reaching a stalemate after a long run, and a series of second singles from popular artists were barely keeping the  Billboard  charts together (including  Ludacris's  "Splash Waterfalls,"  Evanescence's  "My Immortal,"  Jessica Simpson's  "With You," and  Maroon 5's  "This Love"). Then, seemingly out of nowhere, an amazingly hot track hit radio stations across America, called "Yeah!," the hybrid between Ludacris's clever southern drawl, Usher's soul vocals, and  Lil Jon's  crunk-R production. Surprisingly, but not regretfully, the track did not sound like an Usher first single. Yes, the high-strung vocals were there, narrating a late-night club experience, but the song didn't have the feel-good flute soul of "U Remind Me" or even the sly acoustic boy-band vibe of "You Make Me Wanna." "Yeah!" packed a sick buzz-saw beat, which was perfected in its chorus by demented pan-flutes fluttering around the near vocal-less chorus, something almost unheard of in Usher's past, seeing as how the majority of his hits have had multidimensional, layered refrains. Nevertheless, it became a hit, soon spending five comfortable weeks uncontested atop the  Billboard Hot 100  before the release date of the accompanying album,  Confessions.   Much of this album covers ground that Usher has walked many times before, but it still proves his worth as today's top RB man for soul and lovesick hits. For instance, despite synth strings, looped techno beeps, and an almost  Sadé -esque acoustic jazz guitar patterning, "Burn" cannot escape its destiny as the fraternal twin of "U Got It Bad," a fact only proven by Usher's near-trademark out-of-sync ramble verses strung together by an ever-saddening chorus. The case is the same with the song "Confessions," which pitches him as a sexier  Brian McKnight , from its direct imitation of counting in the chorus (remember "Back to One"?) to its production.  The truth is, while Usher does sound fine when he is rehashing his own material, his true inner-funk and grit come out when he is mimicking other stars, something he unquestionably has a knack for.   Take the evidence of "Caught Up," one of the true gems on  Confessions.  Sounding like what  Michael Jackson  would have put out if he recorded  Off the Wall  in 2003 with  Timbaland  as the producer, it hits hard with bass-driven horns and a well-written chorus. The best part of the production, though, is the funky bass line that appears twice in the song and seems like it was taken straight from  Beck's  "Paper Tiger." Similar is the "Rock Your Body" knockoff "Take Your Hand," which borrows the climb-up harmonies from the  Timberlake  song in its chorus, the same harmonies that were used almost 25 years earlier in the sing-back melodies from Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" (the "all night" and "sunlight" parts). The song's beat fuses heavy radio static-crackle with funk-fuzz bass and big band horn hits. Taking a break from the Jacko pastiche, Usher outdoes  Ginuwine  at his own game in "Superstar," the upbeat revival of "Take Away," Ginuwine's duet with  Missy Elliott  from 2001. While easily reduced to being a label-pleasing motivational piece, the song actually entertains with its stuttered drum beat and its upwards guitar spirals. And while Usher does do a good modern soul croon, he continually returns to his "Thriller"-era vocalization, which again comes out in one of the better slow selections on the album, "Simple Things." The cool keyboards from  Janet Jackson's  "I Get Lonely" are lifted to propel the beat, and Usher actually maintains MJ's intimacy from "Human Nature" throughout his inspiring delivery.  Noticing the odd title of this new Usher release (face it, if Michael Jackson named a future album  Confessions,  the world would gawk in worry with open mouths), it becomes clear that he doesn't know exactly who is he.  Cam'ron  classified himself as a dangerous pyro with his 1998 album,  Confessions of Fire .  Chuck Barris , the  Gong Show  host, was immortalized as a potential killer when a biographical  George Clooney  flick focused on him with the title  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . Hell, even  Lindsay Lohan  identifies herself as a teenage drama queen with her 2004 chick flick. Usher, on the other hand, simply "confesses," showing that he isn't sure whether he wants to be the next Michael Jackson or whether he wants to settle down and parrot  Boyz II Men  for the rest of his career. If anything, this album confesses that he can do anything he wants to: he can imagine a world where  Jimi Hendrix  plays underneath  Cooleyhighharmony -era vocals, which defines the near-psychadelia of "Throwback"; he can revive the flutes from "U Remind Me" and mix them with the lost sunny-day techno swirls of  Bone Thugz 'N Harmony's  "Crossroads," which is essentially "Follow Me"; he can even add to the library of RB songs based around a rock guitar riff ( The Root's  "Seed 2.0,"  TLC's  "Unpretty," Michael Jackson's "Black or White") with his own "Bad Girl."  Actually, Usher has done more proving than confessing here. His great vocal range and high-pitched soul struts come out (especially on "Can U Handle It?") better than they ever have before, and he sounds extremely comfortable to be singing over the beats that  the Neptunes ,  Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , and Lil' Jon (among others) have provided him.  Confessions  is a disc with only a couple of immediately disposable tracks, namely the confused ballad "Truth Hurts" and the over-glam of "Do It To Me." And as soon as Usher finally decides who he wants to be, he will be able to stop confessing and to start mesmerizing, while a world of listeners stops critiquing and starts fully enjoying.
