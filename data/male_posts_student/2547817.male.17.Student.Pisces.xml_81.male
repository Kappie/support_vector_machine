Sometimes/most of the time/ all of the time, too strong.  I went for dinner last night with mummy, daddy and mama. We went to this Turkish restaurant where the service was rubbish. I couldn't enjoy my food either coz I was to yolked.  ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************  I don't want to think any more.  I'm glad that I've got pati. She prayed with me over the phone about the little problem I'm facing now. I love her soooo sooo much. I remember I used to cry when I thought about her "leaving". I'm very frightened. I don't wanna loose pati.  I'd be really sad if anything happened to Zel's grandma too. Zel loves her a lot and yah, I wouldn't wanna imagine.  Ne'way, I'm going to meet Jireh at 4.20 and then go for Choir at 7. Will send Sarah home after that coz I dun' like the thought of her walking alone at night. Yah... well... will re entry later. Ciao
