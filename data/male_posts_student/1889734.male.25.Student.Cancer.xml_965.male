This is plainly not the case as this editorial shows.   It seems all that Bush wants to prevent is the growing of embryos for the purposes of harvesting them for stem cells. I disagree with his reasons for this, but I can accept a compromise that uses the already destroyed embryos for research.  This is the future of medicine, and I'm heartened immensely to learn that we are forging ahead in this field. I dream that one day we will be free of cancer, alzheimers, and a host of other ailments. Perhaps it is too much to dream, and the taxpayers should spend the money on paying unwed, unfit mothers to have babies.  What do you think about this issue? I say there is nothing wrong with paying women to grow a fetus to be used as medical material. I know this sounds wrong in some way, but it seems a logical outgrowth of the pro-choice position. Yes, I am pro-choice. The only condition I have is that an arbitrary stop point must be legally enforced as to when an embryo becomes a US citizen. Until then it is a part of the woman's body.  Back to the "Stem Cell Ban." Do you see how the Government's involvement in this issue (as funding research or not) has made progress less likely? Since they have been willing to fund it, they control it. Different politcal whims and expediencies could put an end to this promising new field. If the government obeyed the COnstitution, they would never been involved with this at all. Provate firms would pour money into it and breakthroughs would be more likely. Instead we have edicts from on high telling us what we can and can not research.   The government is not the answer to all of life's problems!
