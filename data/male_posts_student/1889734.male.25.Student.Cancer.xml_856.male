This will be the last time I'll point out things like this with regards to the passing of Reagan.  It is sufficient to be aware of scum like this, and maybe take a moment to sadly shake my head in pity over the state of their soul.  As for my thoughts on Reagan, I'll have some things to say, but not at the moment.  I just don't have the time to properly lay out what I've been thinking about over the past few days.  Tomorrow for sure...
