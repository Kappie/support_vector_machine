We have one year of Theatre overcrowded with people who don't want to be there, but need a fine arts credit to graduate, a program with no funding and a teacher who's opposed to backdrops and sets because they "distract from the actors".  You make every show by virtue of being male, and we still have to have one guy play Mercutio and Escalus.  And we can't even afford to give him two different costumes!  We're a joke.  Seriously, you have no right to complain about your drama program. The talent show went better than expected.  Which isn't all that good considering I expected it to crash and burn.  But it didn't.  Which is good. Show choir has me in a permanently comatose state.  I still refuse to yield to the coffee. Love the vest.  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!
