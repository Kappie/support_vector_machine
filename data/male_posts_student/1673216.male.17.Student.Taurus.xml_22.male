In fact, I do think about doing it but lately I have been chained to something that has fettered my life until this point. I can now make myself do things. I don't know how. I won't ever know how. But from now on I can have the self disipline to tell myself to do something, and I will actually act upon that. My life is going really bad right now, however. I lost the friendship of Lauren somehow (not sure how I f-ed that one up so badly) that could have at least been friendship, but instead it is nothing. Oh well, so much for a successful first try. Second times a charm? Nope...there is no second time. I don't know how I know this.. Somehow I knew over the summer that I would get a chance at this whole high school relationship, but somehow it got messed up and she chose to like someone else. Perhaps my mask has not been revealed to everyone yet. Nonetheless, I shall slowly unravel the stings that cover my true being. This shall be interesting! Help me out with this people..    Off topic, I have to get a job by Saturday for some reason or I get to stop being on the computer for a while. Less computer time = more control over myself = more power to me. I am glad in some ways, but really mad in the parental logic behind all of this.    Right after Tori left offline, things went downhill. My parents started getting mad, and I wanted to pick a fight so I did. I am very fluent in arguement when I have to. So that leads to one thing, and again and again until the domino effect reaches the point where I just want to leave. I just want to grab a couple of things and walk out the door. To the north, to toronto. Maybe I can stay with her for a while? Hah.    To my friends: Lets shake things up a bit, huh? Nothing new is happening. We are all sitting here in the bowels of the machine that is society plugging through one high school lesson after another. Something new is needed...And soon. Scott, are you workin on that revolution? I hope so...I could use one right now.   What else to say...Oh ya, good Echo you guys, I read most of the paper and it was really solid compared to the others. Way to go on three articles Janelle! Excellent ones, too.                The music .    It's been keeping me alive. Seriously, I would be so pissed 100% of the day if I didn't have some music to listen to. And you need the right type of music.. Oar does the trick, and I've been obsessing myself in them. I need the energy. Just how the entirety of the band feeds off the crowd, I am able to pilfer some of that energy for myself. I would like to research why this simple beat and lyrics are evoking so much emotion from me. It's almost all positive too. I am happy with the City on Down. I am delited with About and Hour Ago. I am exstatic with That was a Crazy Game of Poker. All of them in a chain leaves me smiling all school day as I hum in the hallways. I wonder what people think of me...I start laughing and or singing at such random moments. I hope they think I'm happy...I'd like to project that image. I wish my aura made others peoples aura brighten by the slightest of shades. That would make my aura get a bit brighter. A nuclear chain reaction is sure to ensue.   Out for now, hope I made you think about me a bit Captain (not a pompous title)
