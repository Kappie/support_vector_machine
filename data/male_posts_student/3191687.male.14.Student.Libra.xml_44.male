Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    mmmm chocolate.  Anyway,  Earlier today I was working on my mom's laptop that I had hijacked and fixed the wireless network on.  :D  She had been trying for a week or two now to configure her laptop so it would support her employers network, and I had been trying to help her some.  But w/ her hovering over my shoulder going, "lick here! I know its here.  NO click HERE.  GO BACK!  JACOB! If youre gonna work on MY laptop do as  I  say, now click here."  "*sigh* ok mom."   Soon she grew tired and left to work on something else and in five minutes I had teh wireless internet fixed (didnt bother w/ network / files) and was surfing  urlLink /.     Was then stuck there for another 3 hours, during which she decided to instal Windows XP Pro. joy -_-;;  that took nearly an hour w/  FOUR  friggin' restarts.  To steal a phrase, "oy"  Oh, but I did get a milk shake from Sonic out of it :D    Back home now, and should probably be working on the troops website, but I'm going to save that till tonight when my girlfriend's playing RuneScape. heheh.  Though she says she's trying to quit.     urlLink Today's   urlLink Penny Arcade  is the funniest.  The look on Gabe's face is hilarious.  Hmm, I reckon I should go do my work outside, but I don't really feel like it =\  *sigh*    /me drags himself away from the computer to go do his work.
