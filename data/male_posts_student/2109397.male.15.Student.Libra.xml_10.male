People will go "That was random" or "you're random" I really don't give a flying fuck who or wut is random and the fact that you people use that word so much to represent such a stupid comment pisses me off to the fucking max. You should all die.  THose who agree with this statement please supplement the phrase "out of the blue" or the word spontaneous for the bad word.
