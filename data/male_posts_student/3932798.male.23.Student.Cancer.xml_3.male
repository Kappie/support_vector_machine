We go through ups and downs like most relationships; however, she thinks that we go through more downs than ups.  This past semester in school, I had made a new friend who happened to be a girl.  Now my girlfriend thought that this other girl liked me.  (Granted that I did think this other girl was pretty) I didn't like this other girl so there shouldn't have been a problem.  To put a long story short... a lot of terrible things resulted from that situation even though I never cheated on my girlfriend or even did anything with this other girl.   Ok, back to what's been going on.  This week, my girlfriend tells me that "I went to the bars tonight with this guy from my class.  We hung out for sometime talking and  having fun."  Ok, while I can't tell her what to do...it makes me mad that she thinks that she can just go out to the bars alone with some guy she just met.  However, this isn't what gets me.  She has started talking to and hanging out with her ex-boyfriend a lot.  They  go for hikes together and dinners.  Oh, and he pays for them!!!  She thinks it is just fine even though he has admitted to liking her to her.  She tells me that what she is doing isn't worse than what I did with that other girl.  OK!!! For one, I didn't do anything with her.  Two, she didn't like me.  Three, we hadn't previously dated.   The situation just makes me mad, upset, and mostly scared.  My girlfriend has cheated on me four times before (that I know of).  I feel like this is going to be number five with at least one of the two guys.  And what makes it worse is that I can't stop it from happening.  I don't want to get hurt like I did before but who can stop  yourself from being hurt without not having a life.    Oh, well.  I guess I will just wait and see.
