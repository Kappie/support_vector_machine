I'm excited and you should be too - you're the one who's reading it! On to more important things...  Sorry, it has been awhile since I updated this thing. I apologize. I've been busy. Went to the Royals game last night (picture below) and had a very good time w/ Bonomo, Pfeiffer, Brooks and Palmer. It was good times had by all, and the Royals won.  I did find out the past couple of days (especially now since I spend most of my days inside my apartment) that Jim Lee is doing Superman now. Who's Jim Lee? Jim Lee used to draw X-Men back in the early 1990's then did a little book called W.I.L.D.Cats for Image back when Image had just started. He did Fantastic Four as well in 1996 to surge the sales of the book (yours truly owns all the copies of that work - it was awesome stuff.) Anyways, he's doing Superman now and it looks absolutley gorgeous. Take a look at some scans below I found, I think you will agree. I will be going downtown and snagging myself a copy tomorrow. I hope this sort of "multimedia" post today will please all of you "Sieckman-lovers."    Peace out, we'll talk to ya' all soon!    A page in the book- Superman #204, penciled by Jim Lee. (DC Comics, $2.50)     Thanks to "Severn" of BD Forums for the scan
