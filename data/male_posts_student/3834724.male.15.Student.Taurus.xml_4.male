Hmm, since I seriously got nothing to write about, let's just re-tengok what happened lately. Banner bAnner baNner banNer bannEr and banneR!! -_-' It was a torture, but in the brightside point of view, it is fun. ^^  Anyway, I hate to admit this, but I think I seriously get jealous pretty fast, or should I say, that's me? I'm not sure, blek, lazy want to explain everything in detail. Maybe it's just me. Bah, don't care lar. Anyway, John asked me to go to his house, with his sleepy face. But I said I need to do something with the banner and he goes, okay. So I said I'll call him when I'm back, I called him at 400 and he was sleeping, as usual. So, he asked 'You want to come?' I was like 'It's 400' He said 'Yealor' then 'You let me sleep lar, I call you tonight.' -_-" Oh my, thnk you John!! lolx. No comment. Don't care lar. He don't bother to call nowadays though. Blek. Anyway, the one and only fella who is reading this, please don't go to him and goes, 'John, call her lar.' PLEASE, no!! I'm lazy to explain why, but just don't! We both, or should I say me, made a big mistake by telling Anittah, Afifi, Hemma and Yucheng about we both coupled. -_-' I mean, I don't actually give a damn, but, what about you? -.-' oh well, no comment. Yucheng acutally tells out that she thought I coupled with John, which I think she actually believes me and you are couple, don't she? Oh well, go spread spread!! -.-' Soweee.. Anyway, you started it first. -.-' Oh well, I tokok tambah it. sowee ya. Anyway, mom is going to bake durian cake =.=" but she is lack of..dont know what cream. lalalalal, and today's cinnamon i brought to school from home is so not nice, but my friend said it was great, and ended up finished my food. Lalalala. I'm going to hate tomorrow as I'm going to take over 4A11 and I did not buy the bloody useless dicipline book yet, teacher said the dateline was Wednesday, didnt she? Blek, don't care.
