And you told me that you Would try to understand... And every night I wished you Were here, holding my hand.  I'm finding my footing again Just in case you strike me down I'm sure you couldn't but my Thoughts are spinning round and round.  You said you love me, and Hey, I love you too. But I think that you don't love me Like I love you.  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaa. Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, ohh.  I watch the programs on TV To see the world isn't just mine. I live alone, and don't you see, That with my talking duck I'm fine.  Of course, I'd like the company That comes with having you around. What do you mean when you say That I'm not mentally sound?  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaa. Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, ohh. Whoaaaaa-ahhhhhhhhh...Huagh. Ooh!  (spoken) Perhaps I've gone slightly insane. Oh well. It could be worse. I could look, smell, talk like... Well, I could BE Mr. Dubyah. That'd be hell, I'll tell you that now. Thank your lucky stars I'm not in charge of the world. I'd probably resurrect the Beatles. Even the 2 that are still alive. Eh, I'd find a way, I promise you. I could make Paul look less like Bruce Forsyth. Take Ringo back to the days before Thomas the Tank Engine. While I was at it, I could probably sedate Brian May. Give the wanker a haircut. Anyway, yes. (/spoken)  It wasn't you that turned me into me, I promise you now. I think I really need some help, I've run out of rhymes...      somehow.  Whoa.  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaaaaaaa. Yeah!  You couldn't hold me in your arms A moment longer than I kept myself there. I write myself a song to stem the paranoia, To let myself know that you still care.  Whoaaaaaaa... ahhh it's higheer. Oooh higher. Hiya!  Love, Jon Roskilly
