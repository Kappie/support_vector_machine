While I didn't actually  learn  a lot about free enterprise, I did get some good business tips from when I visited Fletcher Communications, a local PR firm.  I'm nearly certain that that's what I'm going to go into post-college graduation.  Not the financial/mathematical aspect, but the funsy/creative-type stuff.  I also had the chance to reconnect with an old Midway friend (circa 8th grade) who's more in the "popular" clique at school.  We spoke for the first day or two, and then she found the popular clique again, so pretty much rarely saw her again.  Don'tcha just love social stratification?  I did have some sort of epiphany while I was there, though.  I finally think I've finally discovered why most of my best friends aren't guys, or at least the "typical" guy.  My roommate and probably 80% of the male population at LIFE spent 19 of the 24 hours of the day talking about sex.  Yeah, guys, can we have conversations that are just a  little  more stimulating?  Intellectually, that is ;-)  I mean, true, someone may look "totally hot," but I don't think it's necessary to talk about it in the graphic detail that they did for most of the day.  Still, they were pretty cool people.  Oh, and I learned one more thing: people from Teague don't pronounce it like everyone else does.  It's not Teague-as-in-rhymes-with-"league," it's pronounced like Tig-as-in-rhymes-with-fig.  It was the strangest thing in the world, yet cool at the same time.  So I wrote my first college application essay just to see how it would feel, and it really wasn't that hard.  Writing within 500 words is extremely difficult for me, yet editing the essay has helped the Concise Factor of my style.  Right on.  What's on tap for the rest of June?  I honestly have no clue.  June has always been the slowest month of the summer for me, but I guess I shouldn't complain much.  Besides, it's thundering outside.  Reason To Celebrate #467.
