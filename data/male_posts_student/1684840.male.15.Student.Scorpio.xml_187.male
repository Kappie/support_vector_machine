We waited for a short while (a few obvious die hard Harry Potter fans there... reading the book!  Daft sods) and were finally let in.  There was a pretty mad rush to the seats and then we waited around 20 minutes for the production to start.  For about 30 mins there were trailers and advertisements until the movie finally started.  I won't ruin it for anyone but it beats the other two movies by storm!  It was so much darker and cooler.  I guess it was because the director wasn't a cheesy American dude lol.  I really want to go and see it again now with my mates but I havent got enough moneys lol.  Maybe some will magic it's way into my wallet.  After the movie (with aching bums) we head off back to Grandma's where we had chicken and ice-cream afterwards.  Just finished watching this SÃ©ance by Derren Brown broadcast on C4, which was quite spooky and interesting.  They called a spirit of this woman who turned out to be alive after the whole thing, prooving it was all in their heads.  I'm gonna get off to bed because I'm whacked.  G'dnight!
