Unfortunately, the new album will be pused back a month, so it's release date is October 5th. I'm also glad to hear that they'll be seting up downloadable previews of their newest songs and that they'll probably be making a stop in the Bay Area.  Well, well, well. I know you've been eager to see an image of the newest Cake album. Click  urlLink here  too see it.  See ya.
