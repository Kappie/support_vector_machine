Join 5SB for Chemistry, as I have to be their technician to handle the LCD projector. At noon went to Kuantan Parade to meet Doc Jamal and Mr. Asri. We discussed many things mainly computer-related stuffs.  After that went to the Clinic at Jalan Gambut for my Orthodontic appointment. Only at 6.15pm I went home with my father now packing my luggage for my seminar tomorrow and holiday. Yay!
