I eat. of course im not the one getting bored because i don't read my own blog. So in other words feel free to stuff your faces but you can't blame me because i am farwell... good. on the other hand i couldnt figure out how to work the term ghetto hooter bitch in so i might get it in tomorrow.  ok I'm over than. I saw hollywood Homicide last night... it was ok. it was an exponential comedy ie it started off kinda meh ish but by the end you were chocking on noodles.. the acting was good. plot good. it wasnt great and it wasnt crap so that lands it squarly on 5 .  i always forget hopw good it feels to make other people laugh.   1 up shroom: CK for making such comfortable underwear *laughs at gropssed out look on carolines face*  Poisoned Shroom: fruit chews. its noisy opening each in-duh-vidual candy thing i was embarassed to hell so i opened as many as i could before the movie started.
