When I arrived for my shift, I found the store full of oddly dressed high school students, some of them in clown make up.  That's right, we had an in-store appearance by  urlLink Zug Izland , one of the bands on the  urlLink Insane Clown Posse 's label  urlLink Psychopathic Records .  I got a chance to talk with them later on in the evening, and when asked why they were in Denver, it wasn't to do a show, it was to "spread the love to all the Denver Juggalos".  Needless to say, it was one of the most retarded nights of my life.  I have a picture of myself and the band, which I will post if I find the money to get the blogger plus.  The funniest thing that happened that night?  They asked all of us to come party with them back at their hotel, which Arianna (my co-worker) was down with because she likes the way their songs talk about "smacking their hos". (her quote not theirs, their music was blaring but I never bothered to listen to the lyrics after I heard something about a  urlLink Faygo  Carnival)  Oddly enough, the CD of theirs that we played had a cover of a song from the Lost Boys soundtrack.  I had a great night, and I want to thank Zug Izland and all the Juggalos and Zuggalos out there for making it posible.  You have discovered new heights of retardation, and I salute you.
