I need a glossary.  Moving on to some self-indulgent links:   urlLink My latest column  from the Sept. 11th Harvard Law Record, about casebooks, interviews, and Warren Christopher.   urlLink Last week's column  from the Record's career guide, which I posted the text of last week, but not the link, about the job search and dress socks.  And an article I wrote in last week's Career Guide about students who stayed in Boston for the summer,  urlLink Boston: Why Leave?   And some non-self-indulgent links:  One of my classmates has a  urlLink really interesting column  in this week's paper about his summer in Africa.  My awesome bankruptcy professor has a new book out called "The Two Income Trap: Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers are Going Broke."  It's a wonderful book, and I'll have a review of it up at some point soon (just read it yesterday), and you can listen to her talking about it on  urlLink NPR , or you can watch a video of her talking about it on the  urlLink CBS Early Show  (where there's also an excerpt).  You could also   urlLink buy the book , if you're so inclined.
