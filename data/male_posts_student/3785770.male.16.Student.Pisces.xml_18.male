Doom 3 is all about the story this thing will scar the crap out of you but in a way that will have you playing it until around 7:50 am. This is defiantly another must buy... or download.... As soon as possible but be warned at first even I was having trouble running this game at high resolution so be ready to make some tweaks.  urlLink
