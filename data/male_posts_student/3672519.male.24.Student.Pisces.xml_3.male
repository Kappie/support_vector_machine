Through 7 years of differing timezones and diverging lives we endeavoured to keep in touch. But yesterday, for the first in a long while, we met at the Esplanade's Garlic Restaurant for dinner.  We recalled teenage school afternoons in Ghim Moh Mac's, wolfing down nuggets by the twenties. We gossipped about old classmates, hazarding their whereabouts. We grumbled about the food. We strolled along the windy river, down Millenia Walk, and ended up at NUSS Suntec for drinks and dessert. Finally, we found ourselves at Darius' house, giggling over his Xbox. It was a perfect night, enjoyed all the more, I think, for its brevity.   In the car-ride home we tuned in to 93.3FM. Jeremy, in his astronaut's monotone, said :"I like listening to Chinese music late at night. They never play anything upbeat, only the slow, sentimental songs." I couldn't agree with him more.  Why will I remember this? Perhaps because 7 years ago, I would have just laughed it off.
