It´s no doubt that some of us will keep in touch forever but Im worrying about those I knew but wherent my best friends and I bet some others feel the same way.  This I would say is a rather good solution, everybody who want to post something would contact me and I will give you permission on this page to post here or wich I would rather not do is that you would send me articles and I post them. If we are like 20 people we could have up to 3 posts a day and that would be fun!  Also I will add in a comment system so we can all "take a piss" at each other as Mr. Aziz would say.  The subject of the posts dont have to be about us or Barcelona or anything like that, you can talk about the last time you went to the bathroom, what you think about chinese food or just something out of the blue.  Anyways I hope I hear from many of y´all.  Still in missing, Úlli
