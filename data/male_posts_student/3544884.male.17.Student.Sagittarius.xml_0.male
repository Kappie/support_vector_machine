So like her brother and some firends had turned off the computer so she went offline, like three minutes later she comes back online and she like doesnt understand me cuase i was still waiting for an answer. So she was like what did you ask, of course i had already told her that i asked her something but i told her i wouldnt ask her again so like in less than a minute she calls and she is all curious about what i asked. But i endup not telling her and she had to hang up cuase she is not supposed to use the phone. And i really was scared to ask her that, but i guess ill have to tell her sometime cuase i don't think she'll stop asking me.
