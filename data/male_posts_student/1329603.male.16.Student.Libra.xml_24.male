Unless she starts conversations or makes an effort to talk to me I'll take it as read that she hates me. I think that's the best idea. The reason I was talking to her was to try and make things less difficult but now she hates me it's making things easier if I don't so I won't Simple, non?  Love, Jon Roskilly
