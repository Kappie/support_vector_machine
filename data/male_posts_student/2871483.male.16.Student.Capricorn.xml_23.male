Beyond realizing that I had no chance with you know who, and that I've been swamped with schoolwork, I also haven't had much sleep.    And now, I will address to people who need to listen to me.  Brionna - Please stop correcting me, arguing with me, insulting me, or attacking me every chance you get.  I am really vulnrable right now, and I don't need to put up with that.  Felix - Please stop humiliating me in science, it really hurts.  For once, keep your goddamn mouth shut and let things go, it's not helping anyone to act the way you've been acting.  Jason - Stop being so hostile.  You act like we're not friends anymore.  Ian - Enough with the annoying physical harm, it's getting on my nerves.  Alicia - You keep talking condenseningly to me.  It's frusterating.  Please stop acting as if you are superior.  To anyone I didn't mention above - Leave me alone once in awhile.  Those things are just adding to an already overwhelming amount of stress.  If you guys think it's fun, it really isn't.  It's hurting me, and I'm feeling more and more antisocial everytime this shit happens.  -  I am so pissed off at Deus Ex: Invisible War.  I have been playing it upstairs, on my piece of crap computer.  No problem, just choppy.  So, I figure I'll bring it downstairs and see the glorious splender that is DEUS EX.  My fucking graphics card is incompatible!!  ARGHH!!  -  For those of you who were overly interested in why I was wear my shades all day, why don't you try not asking in a public place.  I don't want to openly talk about it.  -  In other news, I'm collecting Dew U points, so if anyone has some, give them to me.  -  Here's something thats bugging me.  Question - Would you be mad if somebody gave your name to somebody else?  I don't really think it matters, I mean, seriously.  With so many ways to ignore people, I figure if they want to know my name, fine, but thats all they get.  I know some people who freak out if their name is given away, even if the person it was given to really doesn't care what his name was, and only wanted to say hi.  Besides even that, your name will always be passed around anyway, besides people telling people.
