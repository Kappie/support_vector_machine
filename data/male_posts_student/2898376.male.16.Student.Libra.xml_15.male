Out of sheer boredom, and the fact that I can't be bothered to face 'Discuss the possible benefits and negative impacts of opening a caravan park (12)', I shall waffle on in a manner not unbefitting of  urlLink some really boring people.  (Aha. Just my little joke.  I should probably put some fancy stuff on here...but instead I'll fantasise. What would I like? 1. Have a giant floating sky fortress. 2. Have a massive submarine. 3. Have a really massive tank. 4. Have my own private army. 5. Have a REALLY big fortress, that I shall label 'The Nearly Impregnable Fortress', in accordance with  urlLink Peter's Evil Overlord List    Of course there is more. I can't be bothered with it though. I'm a member of the Apathy Party. Motto; 'So What?'
