It reads -     Wonders are many, but none          none is more wonderous than man.   Man moves over the grey sea,          using the wind and storm,          daring the depths and surges.......   Language and thoughts          light and rapid as wind          man has taught himself these, and has learnt          the ways of living in town and city,          shelter from inhospitable frost,          escape from the arrows of rain          cunning, cunning is man.   Wise though his plans are          artful beyond all dreams          they carry him both to evil and to good .
