I went out of town and I was talking to my dad's girlfriend and she was all you should apply to Boat'N'Net because their always hiring so I took her up on her advice and here I am now one of the many employed people in this country!! Well anyways I just thought I should update my blog and I got to get to work so I'll update again sometime soon. Peace.
