There's still the frustration with aspects of my life, that I have yet to find a complete and full solution to. I still feel a need to escape. However, those thoughts and feelings are now more on the surface and less repressed. That may or may not be a good thing... and with all things... time will tell...  I good thing to note is my worries about my digital arts minor has diminished somewhat. I checked with the School of the Arts and it looks like there are many options available to me.  I need to do something completely different tonight. I'm gonna go out for a little drive.  The song of the moment is Bad Religion's "Sorrow" from their  Process of Belief  (2002) album.  **
