Well, i wake in the morning, Fold my hands and pray for rain. I got a head full of ideas That are drivin' me insane. It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor. I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more.  I ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more. No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more. Well, he hands you a nickel, He hands you a dime, He asks you with a grin If you're havin' a good time, Then he fines you every time you slam the door. I ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more.  I ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more. No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more. Well, he puts his cigar Out in your face just for kicks. His bedroom window It is made out of bricks. The national guard stands around his door. Ah, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more.  I ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more. No, i ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more. Well, she talks to all the servants About man and god and law. Everybody says She's the brains behind pa. She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four. I ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more.  I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more. No, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more. Well, i try my best To be just like i am, But everybody wants you To be just like them. They sing while you slave and i just get bored. I ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more  -  I took a bunch of little quizes while I should have been working.  Interesting stuff.  -  Here's a good question for everyone:   Your mother asks you to watch her poodle, Muffy, while she's visiting your aunt Jenine in Ontario, Canada. While Mama is away, you never feed Muffy, and, malnourished and starving, she dies. Do you:    a.replace Muffy with a similar poodle, in hopes Mama won't notice  b.fake your own death so Muffy's seems inconsequential  c.bury Muffy in the backyard, and say she ran away  d.take Muffy to a taxidermist to immortalize her  e.burn the house down in a fit of rage, and when Mama asks, it was Muffy who did it, Muffy, that little bitch  -  Argh, stupid Mrs. Klaas.  -  This is a great time of the year to watch people, because it is without a doubt the most hectic time ever.  My favourite thing to watch is the classic "Due Date Mixup" which is followed by the "Fuck, I'm Screwed" which is soon followed by the "Rush to Get the Goddamn Paper Done".  Just amusing.  -  I just found out today that I'll have CATON for Honours Am. Lit. next year.  FUCK!  -  Next person to make a crack about homework to me is getting stabbed in the eyes.  No warning then, just one now.
