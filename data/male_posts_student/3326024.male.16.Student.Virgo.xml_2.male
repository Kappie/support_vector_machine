Some are more extrovert, others more introvert, but no matter, you can at least find one other person to relate to. And within these groups there are certain orders within them. Every group needs at least one leader, not everyone can be a leader. For a group to exist there needs to be a distinction between leaders and followers. Now back to the question, in this world, where do you stand?  For me, it differs. I have a two different groups of friends. First off is the group in which I am with a majority of the time. This is group of people that are my age, and I consider to be a leader in this group. I administer choices and make sure that the final decision appeals to everyone. But with my other group, which consists mainly of aquintances, I take a backseat and am more of a follower. I believe that this is because I am the youngest one when with them and am a little intimidated. I consider to myself to have an introvert personality, which the second group mainly shows.   But yeah, where do you stand? Do you like where you are? Are you a leader or a follower? Would you rather be the one you are not? What are you gonna do to change that?
