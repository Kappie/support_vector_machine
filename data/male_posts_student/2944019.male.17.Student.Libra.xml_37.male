I usually skip meals just to finish every assignment or study for the upcoming quiz. I also spend my money on surfing the internet for hours.  Well anyway, I had a great time eating. Here's what I ate yesterday... 1.The leftover adobo and large piece of biko for breakfast. 2.A footlong hotdog during my one and a half hour break. 3.22mL of slurpee at around 1.30 pm. 3.A glass of Pepsi and a few pieces of siomai at Siahara's residence. 4.3 pieces of palitaw and a glass of water at Siahara's residence also. 5.4 servings of rice and a bangus which was cut into two. I took the tail. That was when I got home from my humanities class which was my last class for the day (6:00 pm - 7:30 pm).  And after that, I do still craved for more. But I have to tell myself to stopeating because I'm already feeling full.
