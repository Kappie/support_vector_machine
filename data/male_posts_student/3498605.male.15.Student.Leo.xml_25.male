At first when he was cradling it looked like he was dancing. Then, while practicing dodges, I almost got hit in the same place I did in tennis. Furthermore, bflan was the dodgemonkey. Afterwards, we went to Taco Bell. On the way there we passed the infernal portal to hell AKA the Petco dumpster. It was hilarious, when I got home, I talked to the person who was supposed to show up, but didnt. This is exactly what she said, "OMG, that was today!" HAHA what funniness!  later, bradleyJ
