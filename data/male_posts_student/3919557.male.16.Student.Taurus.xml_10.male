I don't care, but they definetly won't be able to make me do it again.  After work I bought myself a side salad which was really good.  I put croutons, bacon bits, chesse, and chicken nuggets on it.  It was really tasty.   I came home and it stormed.  It was pretty bad too.  The thunder was really loud.  I didn't care, I love thunderstorms.  I enjoy them.  I practiced my trumpet which was intense.  Then I polished it.  It really needed it.  I need to get serious about music.  A lot of people think I am good but there is so much I have to work on before I go to college.  After practicing I got on the computer.  I started the CD I am making for Sarah's mom.  It's going to have a bunch of classical spiritual songs.  It will be cool, I am sure she will like it. Tommorow we have jazz band which is exciting.  I can't wait.  Maybe if it is nice I will go to the beach tommorow.  Well I think I am going to go.
