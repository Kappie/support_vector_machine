But anyway, Farrah was quite vicious to me tonight. She kept being so abusive, good thing I like it though. I barely got to work out tonight, which is probably a good thing as I've yet to get my little condition checked. I found out some nifty news, it's a secret though. I'm quite pleased with it, and hopefully this little tidbit will lead to better stuff later. Well I'm going to shut up now. I'll leave with a quote, as I so like to do. I've been listening to a lot of TOOL again so here ya go "I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this shit, blood, and cum on my hands." (I know disturbing...)
