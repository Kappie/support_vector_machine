I was eating at Burger King today w/ my parents ( I know how lame that sounds............. but I'll save THAT blog for a later date ) and they started talking about this one ass muncher that lives in our apartment. She used to be my widdle sister's friend, but a year ago she started to hang out w/ some girls that were twice her age ( the ass muncher, not my sis ) . That's where she started to become a walkin $2 slut. By now she is only 8 years old by age. Though I can't say w/ total certainty, she apperantly set crazy glue inside the door knob of a neighbor of our's. No freaking 8 year old brain thinks that up. They stayed outside the rest of the night until about 9 o' clock in freezing cold wind and rain. But the one thing that got me to my breaking point was what she did my little sis  ( nobody messes w/ my family but me ) . Her shitty little friends are always hanging around the center of the building. This is a private area and is literally punishable by law to loiter there if you do not live there. They were finally kicked out of the building a few days ago. So the that little llama rapist threw a tamtrum . This made the manager pissed since she has done this before. What the manager did was to ban all kids of our building from playing down there so they are unable ( or less able ) to fraternise w/ the older girls. Then the manager went to the apartment space of that shitty brat. She wasn't home but her parents were. The manager asked who allowed the girls to even enter the building. ( this is soooo screwed up ) . The parents said my sister was the one who always hung out w/ them. How messed up is that? Now you can see where she gets her assholeness from. They are screwing up their kid. I don't claim to be world's greatest father figure material.........but I know when parents go wrong. But like I said............................you don't mess w/ my family. Cus I'll hunt you down.                   On a lighter note ................... thanx for making me feel special AVE!!!!!  : ]
