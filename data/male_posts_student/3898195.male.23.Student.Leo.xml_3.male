I'm sure most of us don't like to deal with people. People are all different and from my experiences most of them are rude, crazy, and have some kind of mental problems. The rule of industry is: "Customers is always right". I'd like people to think about this too, we, workers are humans as well. I don't think anyone works that hard for money would purposely not giving you good services. Sometimes people just needs to calm down, think clearly, and have a little more patience.    You wouldn't believe what kind of crazy people I see everyday. There hasn't been a day gone by that I don't meet anyone that's not crazy... if any, but I can't recall it. I felt bad for the managers or anyone that's in that level of position. A typical worker doesn't know how to deal with customers and they go straight go the manager for help. I think they need to come up with some type of programs for workers to attend to sharping up their people skills. Managers are not the end-all solution to your problems. Most of the time is server's problems. I believe managers are there to coordinate and solve  certain  type of problems, not there to hold your hand to wipe your ass or warm the water in the swimming pool for your feet.    Overall you can make a lot of money working in any type of customer support related business. It's more about the attitude than anything else.
