I could live my whole life without sex for all I care. I simply put my crushes in sexual terms in hopes that others will understand them. In reality all I want is friendship. I like that word a lot more than the word 'love'.  Which brings me to another point. Friendship is the thing I care most about in my entire life. My friends always come first, with no exceptions. I would do anything to preserve and create friendship. I don't know why I value it so highly, but I do. When I was praying at a temple in Japan, I could only think of one thing to wish for, and that was "to have strong friendships for the rest of my life".  I'm not happy when I'm alone. As a rule. I despise loneliness. No matter how much fun I may have had, the second I am alone I am depressed. It's disgusting how dependant a person I am.  When I'm alone, I spend as much time as possible socializing online. When no one is online, I read people's websites. If there is nothing for me to find I search elsewhere for any sort of interpersonal communication. It's disgusting.  This is why I think I try to make as many friends as possible. Unfortunately, I'm also a pretentious whore who tries to convince himself he's better than half the people he meets. On the other hand, it means I truly respect the people who "pass the test" and are my friends. These are the people I love. I would do anything for them, and I like to think they would do anything for me, whether that's true or not.   A few of you I would gladly die for. I would spend the rest of my life with you and I would have no regrets. For me, that's what love is. And I already have plenty of it.
