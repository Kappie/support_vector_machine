I figured why not choose one of the best, "Detroit Rock City". Brian (my sister's boyfriend and guitar freak whom also likes  urlLink Kiss ) played Detroit Rock City with his band at a concert. They used face paint and all! It was so awesome.  Anyways, right now I am reading up a little on  urlLink Kiss . There is only so much a 3 A.M.  urlLink MTV  special can teach a person...
