Gas is over 2 dollars a gallon now, and even though I drive a civic, that is still alot of money to be pumping away. I have stores and stores of fat cells that can be used instead. The ride over there was about 12 miles, not bad, it took me 40 minutes and I just changed in the nine west bathroom. The ride back was in the dark, and I couldn't see all the time where I was going, haha. There was a monster hill that I tackled and a fucking cop flashed by me at like 90 and scared the living shit out of me. Yesterday was warm too, i think somewhere around 76 F and the sun was beating down, but today it is super cloudy and cool. Should be a pleasent ride. Work was boring, still hot on the pursuit of another job. I found a few good ads today, so I had mimi fax the resumes at her work for me this morning. Oh yeah, and that Pam lady, I went to her house, in my car. She has this old Apple Quadra 605 and she is not getting any display. I opened it up and she was shocked at how i did it so easily. hehe. She said the Apple people told her that a battery had probably gone dead, well I found the battery for her and told her to try replacing that first and we can go from there. She was surprised again, and agreed. I was in there for only like five minutes. Speaking of all that, mimi and I are going to the BRC tomorrow for our 2nd training shift. Should be fun again.
