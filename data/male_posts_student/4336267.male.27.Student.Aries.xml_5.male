And this 54Mbps is just the total throughput. The effetive throughput of the existing standards is further reduced (about 18 - 22Mbps), due to the various overheads in the 802.11 standards.   This high data rate may finally open the doors for real-time multimedia communication such as voice and video over the wireless link which would share the bandwidth with existing data transmissions.      Some of the proposed techniqies for increasing the data rates include using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antennas with a 2x2 MIMO antenna, (2 transmitters and 2 receivers) allowing a sata rate of 250 Mbps, and a 4x4 MIMO allowing a data rate of 500 Mbps. It would also employ OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) which exploits multipath (i.e multiple versions of the transmitted signal which arrives along multiple paths at the receiver), to increase the effective throughput.      The 802.11n will operate in the frequency spectrum of 5Ghz as 802.11a, which has suddenly brought this hitherto unpopular standard back into the limelight. It would also be made backward compatible with the existing b and g standards.       802.11n will be ratified as a standard by 2006. But products based on the same will be out by 2005. This is one important development to look forward to in the future.        urlLink  http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3379371     urlLink  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/12/802-11n_proposal/
