Several purchases made by Chelsea during the transfer market were needless. Goalkeeper Petr Cech was a good signing in a sense all the goalkeepers at the club are in their thirties. Neil Sullivan, Jurgen Macho and Marco Ambrosio should and will be offloaded in the summer. Winston Bogarde and Marcel Desailly should be offloaded this summer as well and there are too many defenders that should be playing first-team football regularly instead of warming the Chelsea bench. Emmanuel Petit, Jimmy Flyod Hasselbaink (32 this year) and Mario Stanic are players that are going to depart Chelsea this summer as well. Many people say that Chelsea are doing football a whole new good, but I think that they aren’t. Young players like Joe Cole and Scott Parker among others are supposed to play 90 minutes every match and not come on the bench in the last 15 minutes. So in a sense, they are destroying these players’ careers and the national team are going to suffer from this. Apart from that, every day in the newspaper, we will see Chelsea on the back page of every British newspaper. It will either be concerning a star player coming to Chelsea or a new manager coming in. This will be good for Roman Abramovich but bad for everyone else. I mean this is not about merely bringing in a Henry or a Beckham but is going to demoralize the other teams and going to unsettle his own team and the team concerned.  For example, take Liverpool. If one day the whole team heard that Steven Gerrard is heading for Chelsea for a record breaking 45 million euros, the whole Liverpool squad will be concerned about that rumor instead of focusing on the match. On the other hand, Chelsea fans will be overjoyed with the rumors but the players in the squad will be thinking who among us will be leaving Chelsea to make space for Gerrard and who will have to sit on the bench in order to make Gerrard play.  Many of the players have voiced their disagreement at Ranieri’s tinkering but I think he is doing a great job at Chelsea. I mean if he doesn’t tinker and stick with his starting eleven, many of the other players will scream at the lack of chances to play first-team football. Veron, Geremi and Crespo are a waste of money. I think without these players, Chelsea will be better off. The secret to success for a football team is stability. Arsenal of today and Manchester United of the nineties managed to dominate football because of that factor. A team with a settled starting eleven with 8 to 11 role players will be stabile and they will be able to play football without thinking whether they will make it to the team next week or not unlike Chelsea. I mean if Ranieri sticks with his winning eleven and doesn’t rotate his squad, not all of the star players will even step foot on the pitch for 90 minutes throughout the season.  I think the best policy is that Chelsea start all over again and give Ranieri the freedom to choose which players to offload and which players to be recruited into the Roman Empire. Let next season with the likes of Arjen Robben and probably a few more star him have his starting eleven and let him choose his role players and offload the rest. This is his first year as coach to the new Chelsea, so give him and his squad time to settle in and it is best to judge him on his performance players at the team. If you are not going to play some of the players regularly, then you might as well offload them instead of paying them grand-daddy money for them to warm the bench and let these players waste their time there. I still feel that young players like Glenn Johnson, Robert Huth, Joe Cole, Scott Parker and Filipe Oliveria should be playing regularly instead of warmning the bench. No one will suffer except the players and their respective national teams. These players are supposed to be star players when they mature as players and not bit-part players at Chelsea, and I still feel that Crespo, Veron and Geremi are a waste of money.  Well, this is Chelsea we are talking about and I dare not predict what will happen to them in the near future. A few years ago, they were almost on the brink of administration and mid-table mediocrity, last year Ranieri did a wonderful job by bringing them to the Champions League and looked certain to be guaranteed a job there, this year he is doing better by going to the Champions League semi-finals, second in the EPL and yet looked to be on his way out. It will be nice for us to see them relegated next year, club goes into administration, Roman Abramovich jumps off Stamford Bridge and Claudio Ranieri can laugh at his carcass.
