So that means the next day was Sunday...jorge's birthday.  Ok, so here's how it went down, on sat or friday, me and the guys played some  urlLink star wars roleplaying game, and during that, benny was like "i'm going to the mall on sunday, who wants to come?" so of course, everyong jumped on the band wagon. (everyone but  urlLink mike  went.  BUT, the dilema was that since it was jorges birthday, AND jorge has antioch freinds, it was either go with us or go with them. ahh yes, bow i remeber, this is a friday.  Anyway, saturday goes by...i end up doing something, prolly went to  urlLink jones'  house (AKA Home Base 2k4) again.  so ya, sunday roles by, and  urlLink benny  comes to pick me up around 1:20, seeing as i'm the nearest one. (I live on Cedar lane, he lives on havell street, it's like literally a five minute walk)  So ya, then we go pick up jones, he takes acouple of minutes to get all his stiff together, me and benny wonder why, blah,blah,blah, it's not important...and way he gets back in the car, and we call jorge, cause apparently he's at  urlLink rob's  house sucking his dick....not really, but ya, he was there.  so we roll over there, and there he is, he getes in, we exchange hello's, and ask rob if he wants to come..ofcourse, he says no, and we go.  So, me, being the smart one that i am  urlLink (example)  ask's if he's still gonna go with his anticock freinds.  Apperently, this sparked the COOL-o-meter in jorge's brain, and told us the COOL time he had w/ his freinds...lol, no, i'm exagerating, some SERIOUS SHIT happened.  He was telling us how he went the say before with them, cause thats when they decided to go, so they went to applebee's, ate some apples, and bees, and chilled at Joanna Rose's house.  (She goes to antioch too, w/ her bro mike...dun ask me how i know that...) and then that     urlLink hernandez  (a long time sufferer) had an asthma attack.  But hold on ladies and gentlemen, it gets better....apperantly jorge, being the swell guy he is, had to drive em' there on a PERMIT. (atleast thats the was i understood it, i could be wrong)  But wtf, at least he got em there, then he added that he satyed with him til about 2-3 clock' at the hospital until he went home and caught some heat for not even calling his parents.  Now, there are something i must infrom u of....Hernandez has a sister, a 19 year old sister (i think) i hot sister (so many claim), that has a perfectly VALID license to drive her poor bro to the hospital.  The way i heard it, she was being a bitch, and didn;t wanna drive, so thats why jorge had to drive em there.  I'm not saying i hate her or whatnot, i'm juss addin in some info.  anyway, and also, that jorge says he called, but it din;t get through, which is code for he forgot to, or i dunno....w/e, that last one didn't even matter.  but yeah, so we were like, holy shit, is he alright and what not, and according to jorge he was fine.  I would have called him to see whats up, but i dun have his number, and i can;t call jorge cause his dad is doing taxes, and i can't talk to hernandez's sister, cause them i'm gonna try to hit on her, and embarass myself...so yeah, if you reading this hernie, hope ya doing good, hope ta see ya soon.  OK, well, ya, so the epic quest continued onward, to the tapanzee, were there was alittle bit of a traffic situation...kinda looked like  urlLink this,  except that was the George washington bridge.  anyway, me being the co-pilot (my  urlLink i-pod  give me special advantages) tried to play my best tunes...when that failed, we kept on play "What is love?" by  urlLink Haddaway  I would give u a sample of his song, but all the site i treid to get it off of suck ass.  SO your juss gonna have to go DL it off of Kazaa or something.  Anyway, we ended up having a AMAZING QUEST at the mall.  Originaly, we had planned that we were gonna go to X-zone, a LAN where people play game, make international phone calls off computers..and more importnatly, waste money.  Well, before we did that, we wanted to head to    urlLink Dave and Buster's , but, if you read there  urlLink policies',   you can't get in by yourself if your under 21, with out a person OVER 21 there with you.  So ofcourse, i had a genius plan, in the food court, right next to that asian arcade thing, there was an alternate way to enter, another escalator that led directly into the ass of the place.  Well, everything seemed prefect, we headed up like it was no one's business, no problem, i ofcourse was going alittle quick cause i was excited, so i was ahead of the pack.  I assumed everyone was behind me, so i juss kept going.  On the way, i see this really fat kid, and a somewhat skinny kid juss sitting there, look at us, as if they juss tried the same thing, and that we were going ot fall into the same trap.  But i had a secret weapon...i ofcourse, do not resemble anything 10 YEARS close to my acutal age, so i knew i was gonna get in with out a hitch,  hell, i did it last time i was there to, the guards never thought twice, so i KNEW i wasn;t gonna get caught.  jones was sporting a growign beard, so he def. looked older, and ben, like jones, also was sproting the semi-there beard.  The only one that we were worried about was jorge, but since he was with three "older" guys, they would assume he's under some sort of "adult" supervision, and be let in.  well, anwyay, we continued until we weere all the way in, by that time, jones and jorge were all near me, and literally, we were about 3 feet away from getting in the arcade...once we go through those doors, we were dun.  but, all good things must end sometime, and unfortuantly they ended before they even began.  turns out, benny, who was behind by that time, was caught by a bitch as hispanic she-guard.  I think it was jorge who turned around and spotted him, cause if didn;t i was about to keep on going.  But anyway, we were all like "shit..." and i'm SURE everyone knew we were dun.  so i go over there, and saying shit like "whats the problem" and shit like that, praying that she'll think i;'m over 21, and say "o, i'm sorry, i didn;t know he was with you, go on". BUT, she caught the lie faster than jorge contracts illness's, so we were dun.  We were beaten, but we vowed (atleast i did) to come back , and try a second time.  Well, because D was on the 4th floor, we didn't have to walk along distance to get to x-zone.  we ended up staying there for an hour, played   urlLink Counter-Strike  the whole time.  after that we went back to EB games (we went there shortly before going to x-zone) to look around again.  once again, we didn't do anythign, cause we all didn't know what else we were gonna do.  Well, anyway, the main reason we went to the mall is so Ben can get a hoody sweatshirt, so we headed down to modells.  Well, he found his hoody's alright, but there was a SHIT LONG line to wait on, so we said fuck it.  I on the other nad, the whole time, was staring at all the  urlLink Under Armor  contemplating weather i should get the long sleeve one i wanted, or to wait.  Well, anway, since we were gonna try i diff store, i was juss like "if i dun find i better deal, i'll juss get it here" so we end up going to sports athority, right downstairs, and doing the same thing.  They wrre the same price, but i still didn;t buy em'.  Anway, yadda,yadda,yadda, we saw jorges parents, said hi, yadda yadda yadda, went to best buy, yadda yadda yadda, bought Jedi Knight: jedi Academy, yadda yadda yadda, went home, yadda yadda yadda, went to mikes... NOW....all that did juss happen, but not in that order..it's juss that i didn;t wanna type that whole thing, i've already spent almost 2 hours wrting this time.  anyway, the way we got to mike's house was this.....we had to get home early, so it WAS early..and we wanted to get a game of that star wars thing going on.  BUT....u must remmeber, it was sacred sunday, and jorgie had antioch, and wanted to go, cause they have fun there. anyway, so when we sropped him off, we didn;t know we were going to mikes, so he ended up going.  me, jones and ben end up going to mikes and watching  urlLink Pulp Fiction  (a AWSOME movie) and star wars, a new hope.  But by that, everyone had fallen asleep, so i had to turn of the Tv, etc....Now, lmee juss tell you...i am NEVER going to sleeep over mikes again, the mother-fucker snores like you would NEVER belive....it's fuking incredible...i ahve no idea how he;s little brother can handle it.  it;s fucking nuts. o, and lemme juss say...Sammy Jackson is a  urlLink Baddass.  ANWAY, so u can imagin, i had a pretty bad, and to top it off, i was real sick (and still am) so i didn;t really get a great sleep. (and sorry to whoever i get/got sick).  So ya, then we woke up, spent a-many hours playing   urlLink Soul Caliber 2.  Mike thinks he's good, but he has NO idea what he;s doing...well, anyway, then we got home, and decided we wanted to get a game that day to make up for the one we didn;t have last night, so me, mike, and ben ended up going to jones' house.  While we were over there, we learned that jorge was at hernie's house.  According to jones', he didn't wanna go.  See, thats why we consider jorge to be all our little brother.  Not in the sense that we love him, but in the sense that he;s annoying, and childish, and that everything he does is because someone else did it...he;s a follower, and always will be. No offense to him (and sorry jorge if your reading this) buts it's juss the truth. i mean, because of him, the 3 days at vermont we spent filming went to the shit cause of him, but anyway, ya, so he wasn;t gonna go to jones' any time soon.  So we wait, play more soul caliber, blah blah blah, and then jorge calls back saying he;s going to Sam Ash in White Plains with hernie.  So were all like "fuck" and we juss tell em' get here when u can, or something, and we decided to start with out him....the reason we wanted him to be there was because his new character was being introduced.  anway, it's about 5 minuted AFTER we introduce him, and he show's up wearing that hoody that looks HORRIBLE on em'.  anyway, we play until like 7:00, until mike has to go.  lol, i must add though, mike brought his   urlLink Metal Master  to show jorge and shit, and blah blah blah, when jorge think NO one heard, he's like "why dun i go over, ya know, sleep over, i canteach you new things, blah blah blah." See, thats wht i noticed, the only reason why he goes over hernie's and Mikes so much is to play guitar, and apprently teach them.  Kinda sad if u ask me, but w/e, i'm no one to judge.  but ya, they go, then ben, i stay until maybe 8 20, then go.  I get home, install Jedi academy, and play till like 12:34.  I wake up, and that brings me to today.  I've been home ALL day, mostly playing Academy, and watching tv.  Nothing else.  sabby called while i was sleeping to go to the gym, but i juss couldn't, i'm definiltly going to the gym tomarrow....i love it there, i can juss get rid of all my stress there,  urlLink andy  got me going there, and ever since, i've loved it.  we've pushed jorge and mike to go there, being as there like the only 2 in  our group acutally willing to go, but all we get is excuses from them.  Mike, apperntly thinks sitting on his ass all day, eating like 4 meals a day, and going to weight lifting class everother day for HALF-AN HOUR is gonna make him strong, but what ever.  Evertime he thinks i'm trying to show off, or he feels like showing off his "muscle's" he pretends to stracth his arms, and preetends that he;s doing something to give him an excuse to roll up his sleeves, and show of his fat.  ya, pretty embarrasing.  Jorge ont he other hand, is pretty damn skinny, always has been, always will be.  We want to get him in the gym, cause we all thought it'll get him in shape, and acutally give him some confidence we never see.  Plus, his muslce will show more cause hes so skinny.  anyway, he's apperntly ALWAYS sick, and all the times he went with me, it was a waste of a guest pass.  But atleast he went.  anyway, jones is gonna start going to which is awsome, and ben WORKS there, so he gets to go for free anyway.  But ya, back to life....i've been here...all day, did nothing...and just spent about 2 hours wirting this entry.  if you've sticked to reading this all the way down to here, i thank you, it shows that u really wanna read waht i got to say, and i really apreciate that.  Well, my fingers hurt right about now...so i think i'm just gonna go look at all my old love poems i wrote last year...I'll prolly talk about em' in the next entry...until then, Thanx, take care, and practice what you preach....
