Scorpion is deadly, and she is allergy to insects bites and there's a bite on the neck! She is a very easy going and talkable girl. She is really great! I almost cried when I heard that. She's really really a nice person (to me la, that's what i think of her). All of us are like very paniky and worried for her. We even dont wish to continue sleeping though we are tired, just to wait for the news. Then, Mr Ng and us started to search for the creature and we found a centipede. Some boys got it and split it into several pieces. Though is is violent but they enjoy it.... Then, Mr Ng started to talk about his fwen in the army... he cried, and i can feel how he feels, and without realising, my tears are actually flowing rapidly out from my eyes... I have this fear of losing someone (though Lynn might just a friend that i just made, but it is pain to feel that... if...). Then, I started to pray for her in my heart... ALL of us wait.... AND most of us.... fall asleep in the end... -____-"  When I wake up, I am so relieved to get to know that our dear friend Liyana is fine and is gonna to be discharged soon by this afternoon. It is not a scorpion, it's a centipede! andthere is no bites on the neck!! Wah Mr Ng hor.... *speechless*  We have a light breakfast, two slices of bread with butter and a hard boiled egg. After that, we changed our clothes and head to the RIC immediately. Hmmm... todae is slightly better, everyone is catching up with the pace, maybe cos' it is the morning? Maybe? Not sure. BUT, definitely got improve.  When we get to the RIC, we have our talks... on "Rainforest" and "The wonder of Flowers Garden" [in the RIC]. tehre arent as much pictures for us to see etc during their slides presentation. Howeverm they are quite detailed when they answer our questions.  After that, the Sepilok youths have their lunch with us at our resort. There is this youth call Denly. Erm... try to make friend with him, try to talk to him BUT there is a communication breakdown between both of us [Argh! So annoying!!] I feel so handicap. So, in the end, we just smiled at each other thru'out our lunch time [and it is so weird].  Well, the "best" part of this trip is that we keep walking to and fro from our resort to the RIC. What's more? We have more "walking" when we reach RIC: The Rainforest trail and the Garden walk.  Then garden, actually very interesting though it is not completed. There are alot of nice and beautiful plants in the garden. And the surrounding is damn beautiful!!   urlLink    "Hehe, one of the water lilies =)" urlLink     After that, we go into the forest. It's rather an eye opener to me. there are lots of interesting tress like the Belian, Shorea Smithia etc. Then, we are led to the place with the bridge. Haah!! The bridge is not like those brick or metal ones. Ir is made with planks of wood, ropes and wires-like thinggy. It is rather shaky BUT fun!!  urlLink    "Picture taken on the bridge...cool huh?" urlLink     Oh ya! Still got one more thing! We learnt a song from Ms Benn. It is fun and interesting! This is how it goes:  "Hey Hey Hey. Tombali Hey. (swing arms below)  Hey Hey Hey. Tombali Hey. (swing arms on top)  Tombali Hey-oh (Clap then "hi-5" partner with right palm)  Tombali Hey-oh (Clap then "hi-5" partner with left palm)  Tombali Hey-oh Hey-oh (clap and "hi-5" partner with both palms twice)  Tombali Hey-oh Hey (sissors, paper, or stones)" Then the winner get to massage the loser... lolx...   Well, todae... WenRong and ZiJian shared a secret. Well, you know, I am K-po type though it is not written on my face. So, I go forward and ask them. OKAE, WenRong actually "shoo" me away with a serious tone. They claimed that it's their secret, cannot/wont tell the third. However, I saw them sharing with weijie (jie). At first, I am like okie.... nvm... BUT during dinner, they actually shared with Cindy and Rebecca.  I mean, what is this?  Wow, they didnt tell the third but the forth and fifth?  I feel totally left out todae.  First cos of WR thingy, then i try to go to Clarence that grp... but there's isnt much common interest that will make me fit in.... *sigh*
