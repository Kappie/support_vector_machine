Who is the hero of the novel?  Huck or Jim?  What are the most significant themes from the book that affected you personally?    What about Toni Morrison's question:  "Yet the larger question, the danger that sifts fr om the novel's last page, si whether Huck, minus Jim, will be able to stay those three monsters as he enters the 'territory.'  Will that undefined space, so falsely imagined as "open," be free of social chaos, personal morbidity, and further moral complications embedded in adulthood and citizenship?  Will it be free not only of nightmare fathers but of dream fathers too?"  Have fun!  Remember to study for Monday's test.   :-)  Mrs. V-A
