When we first walked down those hallways, we felt very much like hobitts in a large town. Having everybody frown upon you and tower over you as you walked... Middle School is a complete opposite from elementary. You don't have to walk in single file lines when you left the classrom and you never have to sit indian style during school assemblies. You had many teachers, instead of the same boring, homosexual teacher you always had, for 8 hours...with his gay roommate...and his stupid poodle hair...and his constant grudge against me...and his annoying voice...and his non stop jabber...and his stupid grey shirts that were way too small for him...and his stupid shoes...and his constant grudge against me...Anyway...  Ryan Hewwit was my best freind in the begining of 6th grade, until, the incident... Some of my freinds out there might know what the incident is...but for those who don't here it is... My buddy Ryan...oh God bless Ryan! Ryan had a serious addiction with Brittany Whitcraft...He knew the poor girls locker number!  But knowing her locker number obviously wasn't enough for him...He sent me on a recon mission to find out as much info about her as possible.  One day, we were in PE. Brittany Whitcraft was playing basketball and me and Ryan were on the sidelines. Ryan told me to go out onto the court and look for her... Well I went onto that court but I couldn't find the girl. Just as i started to walk back onto the sidelines, a girl came running by an tripped over my foot...I tripped to and my face would've landed onto that hard, rubber, floor if that girls butt wasn't there to coushon it. Well, when I retracted my face from the organic airbag everything went so slowly...the only thing I could hear Ryans maniac demon laugh in the backround(mabye because it was so loud that it drowned out  everything else)Then I heard a girl sream and shout out " EEEK! BRITTANY! HE'S SNIFFING YOUR BUTT!!" Everything snapped back into place. Things went faster...It seemed as though everything was getting fastfowarding. I started to panic! Thoughts poured into my brain     brittany? Birrtany Whitcraft?!? Is this her butt!?!? OH MY GOD! SENTERFITTS GONNA KILL ME!!! It's all lopsided but i geuss it's oka-WHAT AM I THINKING!?!?! IT'S THE END OF MY LIFE! I Gotta get out of here!    My blood raced through my vains at a super fast rate as my heart beat faster and faster. I slowly stood up and walked very calmly out of the gym with Ryan, my hands shaking. Ryan was cracking up laughing as we walked. " It's not that funny Ryan!"  " Ya it is!"  " Lets just go play tag or something" "whatever...BUTTSNIFFER!!!" "Shut up!" A couple of minutes later. The double doors to the gym busted open and there was Jonathan Senterfitt... Walking very slowly towards me. Behind him was about every single kid in the gym, including Brittany and her freinds. It was   the slowest 35 seconds of my life. The angry mob gatthered and stopped when Senterfitt stepped up to face me. " I heard you smelled my girls butt..." He said blankly. "I-I tripped over h-her and my face landed in that p-per-perticular area" I studdered.  " YOU WERE SMEELING HER BUTT LIKE A FRIGGIN MONKEY YOU PERV!" One of Brittanys freinds said.  " Shut up! Now tell me why you tripped over her" " I-I was on th-the court looking for h-her" I said. " Really? You found her allright!" He said, his dark eyes staring into mine. " It was an acc-accident" " Why were you looking for my girlfreind?" " M-my freind Ry-Ryan has a huge crush on her and I was gonna tell her" " Who's Ryan?" " Him" I said, pointing next to me, but staring right back into those dark eyes. "Who?"  "The boy standing right next to m-" I looked next to me and there was no Ryan, I looked behind me and I saw him...Running like hell. " Thats Ryan" I said, pointing my thumb behind me.  Well Senterfitt finaly forgave me after a quik punch to da stomach. But Ryans little weasel escape really pissed me off and I didn't talk to him for like a year.  I met many many people in 6th grade that I would grow with and socialize with for the next three years. I met Eric Skinner and Yamik Gonzales, two freinds that would continue to crack jokes and have fun with me for three years. I met them when 6th grade went to the science mueseum in the beggining of the year. All the kids who didn't go had to stay with Mrs. Young...It was extremely boring...UNTILL I MET ERIC AND YAMIK!!!! They were really funny! It was goofy! Silly! CrAzY! FUNNY times!  Ok....i'm finished...Well Yamik, Eric and I remain freinds to this very day! Even though it's only been like 20 days since I last saw them...  I also mat Evan Berben, a kid whos styles and interests have changed every year. We were in PE and I saw this little srawney, skinny  beach blonde boy with a huge scrape on his forehead. He introduced himself and so did I. I thought he was abused and beat by his parents. So being the blunt, idiot I was I asked: " Do your parents beat you!?!?" The boy stared at and said, "...um, no...do yours?" "No" "Then why'd you ask?" "You have this huge scrape on your forhead and bruises all over your arms, I thought your dad was a drunken lunatic and he hit you with a beer bottle then your mom beat you senseless..." "Bike accident..." "oh...I was off a little..." "ya..." And for some odd strange reason he has remained my freind since that disturbing introduction. I think it was because he realized that I was creative. Well anyway, Evan has been in every single one of my Science and Social Studies classes since 6th grade.  Another heavy infuence that entered my life that year was Micheal Fletch...uh...nevermind  Mr. Gardiner! WOOO WEE! WHAT A CLASS!!!! When we were in 6th grade they put you in an elective for 9 weeks, just so you could get feeling of each elective. There was an A Day and a B Day. On A day  I had PE and Social Studies, on B Day I had an elective and Science.  ex. Monday I would have PE and Social Studies, and Teusday I would have Technology/Drama/Home-ec/Life Choices and Science. I hope you understand. (if not, post a comment or leave a message in my geustbook)    My 4 electives were: Drama, Home-ec, Technology and Life Choices  (guidance counselor, Mrs. Rist, taught it) The 1st nine weeks of the year I remember having Life-Choices, 2nd nine weeks I had Technology, 3rd was Drama and 4th was Home-ec.  Well Drama, Home-ec and Life Choices were all interesting but Technology was the most hated (yet anticipated) class of the entire 6th grade. We all heard that Mr Gardiner was mean...But we were not prepared for what we were about to encounter... The first day we entered that room he was siting in his office. We were lined up against a wall. He sighed when he saw us and walked out. " Hello ladies and gentlemen, please seat your selves in alphabetical order starting now, you have 30 seconds." I hurried and flopped myself into the first chair. I had the easy last name of Auffenberg. and luckily there were no Adams in the class.  Once we were all in place he said, " Hello, I'm Mr. Gardiner, there is only one rule in this classroom and it is as follows: It's My Way Or The Highway, if you have a problem with that rule please get out right now because i'm not wasting my time teaching you." Then, his stern, cold expression changed into a a grin and he said a bit more cheerfully, "Let me just say this is the funnest class you will ever have the pleasure of being in at this school. It's fun! In the course of nine weeks you will be given three homework assignments, if you do all three you get an A, if you do two you get a C, if you do one you get a F, if you do nothing you get a Zero. I'm going to teach all of you how to make the gizmo inside your head work" as he explained the guidlines and laws of his classroom, our happy, gleefull, no worries school year vanished in the most intimidating 45 minutes of the entire 6th grade...  Well... I got so many ASD's (After-School-Detention) and Refferals from Mr. G, my parents nearly took me out of the class. I defintely did not put Technology on my electives request form for 7th grade...  Another life changing person I met that year was Micheal Fletc...uh...no..nevermind...mabye someother time.       Mr. Bramlett! YA!!! ROCK ON!!! Mr. Bramlett was my 6th grade Social Studies teacher. He was realy cool. He was really funny. He gave way too many notes! Every day he gave three entire pages of notes to copy. first he gave us a Roman Numeral, or topic...then he gave us a capital letter, or fact, then he gave us about 12 lower case letters, or supporting facts to the capital letter fact... Each day we got to XVI...Thats 16 roman numeral topic sentences! Thats 16 capital letter fact sentences! Thats like 25 lower case supporting fact sentences! Thats like: 69 sentences all together!(somebody better correct me in my forum if i'm wrong... PHIL! Your the smartest person who visits this blog! you know my math skills suck. You tell me if I'm right or not! Take your time and figure it out Phil! Thanx!) It was crazy! We were just little kids! But besides all the notes, Mr. Bramlett was really cool. He gave us really cool assingments. Like Historical Imagination assignments...as you probably already know, I'm very creative! So I loved roleplaying and writing as an Chinese silk trader or something like that. He also gave us puzzles! Mr. Bramlett was my last class of the day. So I'd always walk with him to his wifes room (Mr. Bramlett's wife was Mrs. Bramlett...uh..ya), she worked as an 8th grade teacher at the school. So I'd walk with him everyday to his wifes room and we'd talk about everything. And then I'd go outside and wait for my dad to pick me up.      Another event that happened in 6th grade was Brittanys 2nd crush at O2b...His name was Ryan Clemmings I asked her to share her story...  Brittanys Story about Ryan Clemmings. My home diggity. As told by Brittany Filer:  "When i first met Ryan I was 12 years old and i was in the play village area, and I saw a guy who I hasd't seen before and he was surrounded by girls. So I decided to introduce myself to him.  I  fought my way through the girls and stepped up to face him. I said " aren't you a ladys man." Then he laughed and went "well thank you." And I told him who i was and he told me who he was and then that was that, I had to go out to snack. Some other girl also was attracted to that sexy hunk of man flesh, so I got very competitive with her. But we were still freinds. We thought of nicknames for him, my nickname for him was Ryry. So we went over to Ryan, he was in the costume area, and we went over to him and told him our nicknames for him. She told him hers first, which I forgot, and then I told  him mine and when I told him mine he told me that all his girlfreinds had that one. I was really happy. An so, I'd always hang out with him. And one time we were in the think tank and he told me that Cliff was coming, and i didn't believe him. And we got into a big fight and I got mad at him , so I climbed up the Big Toy and I could see Ryan from where I was and he was in the play village. Every now and then I'd shout "Ryan!" And he'd look p and I'd duck down.So after about an hour of doing this, I went down the slide and I sat at a table in the cafe. And he came over and he put his drink on the table, and then he picked it back up and said "I don't want my drink near you!" And put it on the table next to mine. I was mad at him for the rest of the day and the next day, when I returned I gave him a big hug. And he said " I thought you were mad at me" and I said " I can't stay mad at you" And all that year, I was in love with Ryan. Later on that year he ditched O2b and so I got really really really upset and then I saw him on a wednesday at the mall and it was christmas time and he got a job as an elf doing santa pictures, so I ran over and said hi to him. and then I didn't see him till the end of 7th grade... Sometime last year,dad took me,and my brother leno to a basketball game and  I saw Ryan and I gave him a hug...I practically cried when I saw him! I got over him for a while...but he returned once again...in eighth grade"     CRAZY NASTY GIRL!  Well, we'll get into more of Brittanys love life later on. Okay, moving on...I'm pretty sure I didn't go to O2b all of 6th grade except Hollyween. All summer long I stayed home and watched Ernest movies...And Mr. Rogers...And Giligans Island. You know I've been thinking...I think if they killed Giligan or the Skipper they woudlv'e gotten off that island in a week...Well I made a Poll about it and I urge you to vote on what you think they shoudl've done.   Whoever is reading this...SPREAD THE WORD ON KARLS BLOG!!!!!   Wells anyways, I will now dwell into 7th grade....please scroll up....
