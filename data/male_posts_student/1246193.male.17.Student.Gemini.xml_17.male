I planned my entire high school career around a nine hour day with early bird.  I have been completely screwed over! I love art and orchestra.  I hate strength training with a passion. Yet the government feels that it is more important that we all be a bunch of big muscular jocks than a bunch of intelligent artistic people who can express our feelings.  Why do they think that they know what is better for me than I do. Why isn't band or orchestra required? We would have much better math scores and live more fullfilling lives. I don't know what I am going to do.  I feel like screaming a whole lot of really inappropriate obscenities!  I have to go talk to my counselor tommorrow, I don't know what she can do.  Maybe she can give me a second early bird, no no, she will drink her coffee and say,"Oh I'm sorry, you'll have to drop a class" all the while thinking," When will this kid leave my office. I have some important solitare to get back to." That isn't fair. Mrs. Sawyer didn't do anything to me, I just am frustrated. No I'll rephrase that:   I AM FREAKING PISSED!
