Also on an unrelated tangent, I stayed up til 3 am last night with my roommate, going through  intricate detail of my harrowing ordeal two years ago.  Though the audience was biased, it gave me confidence to know that I'm not just wrapped up in my own little world and yes, she was in fact, a cold hearted beeeeewithacapital Byatch.  He believes I will forget all the bad stuff when I find the right girl and I essentially believe the same.  Cept its been 2 years.  The search is long, but I'm hoping the payoff is even greater.
