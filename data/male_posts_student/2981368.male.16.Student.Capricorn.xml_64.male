So now I need a cool new name prefix to go with 'monkey'. Like 'ninjamonkey'. Or 'kahrayzeemonkey'. Suggestions more than welcome.  Great Belgian English:  "Veynom: The suggestion of Tembre is good. I will now make sure that it works."  Mr Snyers d'Attenhoven will never let you down when you're on the hunt for bad grammer and sentences that don't make sense.  Anyways, I'm now off to beat the crap out of people with quality names like "Andre Siminski" and "Peter de Dijker". Awww man, these Europeans are funny.
