I fall behind and arrive in just enough time to see him get gunned down by two of LB's henchmen. (Laura Beth was the head of the bad guy secret police). After an ensuing gunbattle, I am taken captive. About the time that she finishes questioning me, the rest of my spys come out and are quickly subdued and captured. Then LB orders them to be executed, shoots me in the head, laughs an evil laugh, and drives off in her black bullet-proof Jaguar.
