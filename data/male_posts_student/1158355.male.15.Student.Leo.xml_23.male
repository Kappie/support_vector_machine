Try and read between the lines.  I can't imagine why you wouldn't Welcome any change, my friend.  I wanna see it all come down. suck it down. flush it down." - Tool  Tool is right. This world is full of fucked up people killing one another. We should be all washed away. You think we're peaceful? That's why we bombed their asses. Damn bombs dropping like raindrops onto their heads burning their children in front of their very own eyes. Death surrounding them and for what, for one man who didn't listen to the bully of the world, The US. I mean come on what the fuck, he's been threatening us since the gulf, the guy's all talk. This world is a shithole, you are a slave of them. Listen to me, we can escape this. We can all live in a world, with no rules, no boundaries or borders, a world without them. A world with peace. A world with true life. A world without fear. A world where anything is possible.  Sorry about that, it's my religion. I don't know where I am. Am I in the real... or am I dreaming? If I'm dreaming, I just want to wake up, if I'm real, I want to stop the Rennaisance... I cannot. Unless I have followers to this religion. There will come a time... trust me. I will be the reason we will be saved from them, and if we are dreaming, I can only posess ourselves into believing we're slaves. That's all for I am not the chosen one.  I'm really expressed my deep thoughts. Ok, today I had the gay track invitational in Amityville but I kept going to 711, I bought a alot of food and kept stealing slurpees. After track I went to Angelica's with Steve A and we basically just jumped around the trampoline the whole time... fun! Yea, the day sucked... the night was awesome. Tomorrow I'm having non stop fun with the neighbors.
