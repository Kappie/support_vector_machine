I have no idea what to do or what kind of stuff I'd be expected to do, but I can assure you that I will do this to the best of my ability.  :D  And I ALSO get to be a girl.  Wow.  I'm so honored.  And now I think I'll go shower...although you probably don't care.  Oh well.  Au Revoir, amigos...  The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
