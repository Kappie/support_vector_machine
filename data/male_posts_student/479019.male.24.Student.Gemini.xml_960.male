It was nice, despite the addition of 20 minutes to my drive home.   I like the gold and ochre colors of the chaparral more than the dark greens and browns of the east coast wilderness.  However, the vibrant greens of Scotland win over everything I've seen.  Lots of shows next next weekend, hopefully I can actually go to them.  Mmmm... beer...  Here's a little dialogie on beer: Me: beer feels clausterphobic in the box and wants the warmth of a human's love... like a puppy. Diana: how does it feel in the human's mouth. Crystal: you dont consume puppies, hopefully. ***
