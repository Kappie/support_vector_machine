Yesterday, however, Mr. Earnscliffe himself David Herle was questioned about the strategy by CPAC (heres a link to a CTV story on it):   Herle admitted in a previous interview on CPAC that cabinet ministers Judy Sgro and John McCallum were instructed to pursue and confront Harper at his campaign stops in Markham last week.   Good good, nice to see someone taking responsibility. Hmmmmmm, but it doesn't seem to jive with Judy Sgro's comments earlier this week:   Ms. Sgro, meanwhile, said yesterday she felt she had to stand up for her rights.....She said  she was not given direction by the campaign team . Rather, she sent an e-mail to her campaign manager describing what she had planned. That e-mail was in turn forwarded to Mr. Littler, who had no objections.   Ouchies. Is something burning?
