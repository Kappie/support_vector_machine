English with a funny old woman because Audouin had gone AWOL, then a good maths lesson to end the morning.  Games was cool, it was a bit chilly though.  Natalie wanted a mention, so there you go    After school me and Sam went down town to look at this Alton Towers deal thing.  We had a really cool time on the way, chattin' about stuff.  We got to the station to find that we couldn't do the Virgin Train deal to Alton Towers, however, the bus there and back is free!  So we thought "fair enough", and then went to McDonalds thinking about how we could get cheap tickets to Alton Towers.  We had a really good time, it has been the best day this week by far!    We went back to Sam's house and browsed the Alton Towers website and thought "Damnit, there are no cheap deals  ", then when we looked at the front page... £10 MISS THE MATCH DEAL!!!!!  PERFECT!!!!     So that's that!  Alton Towers next Friday, 10AM for £10!!!  I can't effing believe it!  It is going to be such a bloody good day as long the weather is nice.  Anyways, fun!  Theres a bit of an argument now because laods of poeple have suddenly got Blogs.  Here's what I say!     All hail the photocopier!
