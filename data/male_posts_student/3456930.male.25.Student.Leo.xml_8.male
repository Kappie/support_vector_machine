I hate people who play pokie machines. I hate the fact that I was only meant to be on for 4 hours, max, tonight but, because of 120 odd people in the bistro, I had to stay on and miss my last bus and have to fork out money for a bloody taxi.  Yeah, I know. I'm just complaining. But dammit, I think I'm allowed to. I'll just say that it was an absolute c*nt of a night.  On another note, it was good to see Jol and Jas this morning (even if I was still half asleep when they arrived). It was a case of....  J: We're 30 kms out of Newy. We'll be there soon.  D: Cool. Jol and Jas are coming. I'd better get up and - zzzzzzzzzzzzz!  *Car door closes and D wakes with a start*  D: Ah crap... stupid tiredness...   I would really like to thank them both for dropping in on their way up to Armidale. Thanks for the copy of 'Lowside', Jas. And thanks for the poster Jol. If any of you know me, you'll probably know of my fervour for the Crow movie (watched it 9 times in  a 24 hour period when I first saw it). Also, I have declined to donate my organs... just in case I, too, have to rise from the dead to avenge something or other. So Jol thought i would like a Crow poster for my birthday which is coming up on Wednesday. Now I just gotta find some place to put it...  Also, thanks HEAPS for the fleecy vest. It's bloody fantastic!  Anyways, that's me done for the evening. I am absolutely shot so I'm just gonna go to bed and sleep the sleep of the dead.   Lowman X   "Nothing! You say! Matters! To us!"
