It isn't something you want to prove to the world... just you want to see how far a limit you can push yourself to. Instead of proving to anyone, you are proving to yourself.  I've laid waste of my life for way too long... sleeping, watching TV, play games, slacking off pondering and day dreaming... etc. You know... the not-so-productive activities that everyone of us go through every single day. I don't want my surrounding people to call me a geek or anything by doing the usual 'geeky' stuff... like carrying and reading a book all the time. (I actually seen a geeky guy do that every single time he comes to my restaurant to eat... *shrug* What a fag...)  I've figured some of it out last night. Most of us can reconfigure our daily lifestyle just by watching out for the tinniest little things around us every day; mainly just organizing. When I get a book from my bookshelf, after I read it I just have to put it back. When I buy new stuff from store and very excited about it, just have to throw the wrappings and box away instead of laying they on the floor. Most important, a timed schedule... something not too strict but just a general idea of hourly tasks. I believe the hardest part is to follow your own schedule, because something always come up that's not according to your plan and ruin your time management. That's why I proposed a 'general time schedule'. Not down to very specific details but rather an organized time for myself.  Today would be the first day I'll try to make up a schedule and follow it, so wish me luck! ^^
