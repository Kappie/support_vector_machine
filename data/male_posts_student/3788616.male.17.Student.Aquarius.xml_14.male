Even though i can say that i didn't do much, but it seems to be that after Amy's brief visit to the class, everyone is communicating better now! heex... anyway, talking about Amy! it's great to hear from her again! haha... hey, i am sorry for being such a poor host, but anyway, sure hope that your experience here made it fun filled as well as that you have taken something away with you! sure hope to hear more from ya! haha... kind of miss you presence in the school though... like got a missing hole or link in the class now... so used to see you charming face among the 'Charlie Angels' in class!  Anyway, damn it... i've fallen sick again! Argh! why ah?! why is it that i am so particularly weak this year?! I think it's because i don't take as much time to exercise now with school ending so late and with stress piling on me as each day passes! Anyway, sure hope that i get well soon... don't want to miss school tomorrow and end up letting down the CO! I don't know why but suddenly, i have this sudden wanting and desire to make the CO better and bigger... fa yang guan da! I hope that tomorrow's presentation would be a success and that i would be able to draw more people to join CO! *crossing fingers* hey guys! Pray for me ok?!  Oh man! i am so frustrated! Man! Chris forgot to bring the present that was meant for Kelly! Argh! grr... was meant to... nevermind, can't reveal my plans now... but... wah lau... now i have to rush most of the things tomorrow! damn it! but it's ok lah, Chris, after all, i owe you a favour for helping me get it in the end! Oh well... anyway, really hope that can settle and get everything ready by tomorrow! heex... ;p  Kelly! you are damn lucky! i got an OFF for my terms! Man... i need to study harder and work harder sia! Man... haha... okok... i really need to buck up liao! Seriously! Argh! okok... enough is enough lah... really shouldn't whine so much... but can't help it! i pray that Li Feng does well and that the LORD would bless her! She seems so unsure at times, but let's pray that she gets the confidence as the experience builds up too! heex...  Kelly... i hope that her finger is completely healed, perhaps 1 day, you'll truly undertstand how i feel for you... ok... anyway, it might be soon lah... ;P okok... anyway, everyone! keep smiling and take care! ;p
