If the French couldn't understand me before, they certainly won't be able to understand me now.  Just three more months, then I won't have to wear it in school anymore.  Stephanie Kaplan says I should be a rebel and only wear it at night.  Yeah, a rebel with bad teeth who'll have to wear braces again.  I've decided to table the main effort of my plan for at least a couple of months, for a variety of reasons.  I may pursue the other option, though.  Elliott said yesterday that we should talk on the phone to discuss my performance as "The natives are restless."  I agree that my direct on Tuesday was horrible, but Thursday was a real improvement.  Unfortunately, Elliott wasn't in the room at the time.  He still hasn't called.  But now he certainly has stuff to complain about, given that I can't talk with this goshforsaken retainer.  Here are a few politically incorrect Ben Fong jokes:  Silly Negro, Trix are for kids!  -------------------  -What's the difference between a pile of dead babies and an old Pontiac?  -I don't have an old Pontiac in my garage.  -------------------  -How do you fit a hundred Jews in a car?  -Put two in the front, three in the back, and 95 in the ashtray.  -------------------  -What do you call a hundred white people running down a hill?  -An avalanche.  -What do you call a hundred black people running down a hill?  -A mudslide.  -What do you call a hundred Mexican people running down a hill?  -A jailbreak.  -------------------  -A black man and a Mexican are in a car.  Who's driving?  -The police.  -------------------  -Why doesn't Cuba ever win in the Olympics?  -Because all the Cubans who can run, swim, or jump are in the United States.  -------------------  -How do you get the population of Mexico?  -Roll a nickel down the street.  -How do you get the richest man in Mexico?  -Whoever catches the nickel.
