I have posted about that before and if necessary you may want to visit http://piratesblog.blogspot.com to see me explain a Bush fanatic why Bush is a monkeyboy and why he should be replaced.  Anyway, back to the movie. There are sites where you can find things that were wrong and untrue in Fahrenheit 9-11. I have scanned over some of those things and I'm quite certain they don't explain that 2 full hours of film only consists of lies. The makers would have done that if they could but even though not everything is correct there is too much truth in it to be tagged 'consisting of lies'.  Anyway, now really back to the movie. Moore has gone easy on Bush. He has only shown one Bushism (= a speaking error in a word or proverb made by America's glorious leader George W.. as Maddox said before me: the word Bushism is stupid. When any person except Bush makes a similar mistake we call him an idiot or moron. This guy is nothing different [no, this is not an exact quote]) in the entire movie.  Besides that the poverty in America was only used in a part about the recruitment of soldiers. While it actually could have been one of the major points in the movie. But I guess that if everything where Bush is fucking up would be highlighted the movie wouldn't have been 2 hours but 2 days.  What was it about then? First Moore was explaining how incestuous the relation between the Saoudi's and Bush/America is/was and how incestuous the relation between Bush (and some of his ministers) and the companies who are helping rebuilding Iraq is.  After that the Afghanistan war became highlighted. It showed how it was just used as an excuse to attack Iraq. That Afghanistan didn't really matter. There were people quoting Bush and Rumsfeld saying that Iraq was the only thing on their mind.  Anyway, next up, the Iraq war. Did Moore talk about the fact that international laws had been broken? No. Neither could he talk about the images from the Iraq prisons. The movie was released before that. Still, without those points, he managed to show everybody why George Bush should be stopped.  Anyway. When you saw Bush or heard a quote of Bush you were waiting for the inserted laughing of the audience like you hear it with sitcoms and such. Not waiting for a laughter like when Al Bundy says something cool. No, more like a laughter following a Kelly Bundy remark. The laughter didn't come though but perhaps I didn't notice it because the real audience could have drowned it out.  Yes. There were some bad arguments in the movie. Fuck that. Every Bush Dipshit will hold that and say 'hey lookie here, this is wrong, I guess everything is wrong then'. Fuck them, they're ignorant.  In the fields are bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning death and hatred to manking poisoning their brainwashed minds (O moore yeah?!?)
