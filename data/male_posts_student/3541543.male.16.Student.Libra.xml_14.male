Since by going to this you are obviously interested in knowing who I am....or you clicked on this by mistake and trying to see some hot chicks blog and hope for boobies. Well whatever the case your here now and that's all that matters. Right? Alright well enough small talk let's get down to business and I'll start off by telling you some things about me.  1) my name is Thomas something something. I'm sort of paranoid about identity theft, especially since those commercials I saw on the tv. The ones where some lady or dude is talking and it's like a totally different voice. I like the commercial, it has thoroughly (hope that's is how it's spelled) scared the crap out of me. So if you really want to know my full name I'm sorry because your probably one of those psycho identity theft people, I think no one really gives a care anyways.  2) My racial background is pretty abnormal I suppose. I'm half Korean, a quarter Greek, and a quarter English. Pretty crazy combination, I'm just glad I don't have squinty eyes and an awesomely flat nose. Since I put us on the topic of my physical appearance I shall give a somewhat brief/lengthy description. I am 5 feet 10 inches in height, not bad for Asians but that is pretty much it for me. I'm not going to grow anymore and will probably start shrinking very soon. I have tan skin, but I don't go to tanning booths because frankly I was born with tan skin and tanning in a booth I consider pretty dumb. We have this thing called the sun and you'll get less chance of skin cancer (I heard... I think I heard) and it's free. I'm all about free. Sorry, got a little off track there let's get back to business; I have black hair, brown eyes, ten fingers and ten toes, two nipples,two eyebrows (not one thank god) etc. nothing out of the ordinary. My hair is sorta medium in length, nothing extreme yet. I have all of my teeth haha. Oh yeah, I'm 16 and attending highschool. I will be a junior this fall. I live in Joplin, Missouri and have been for quite sometime. I'm going to have my friend show me how to put a picture of myself on here and hopefully it will go well with the ladies....I can only hope.   3) If you have gotten this far in my "blog" something is wrong and you are actually interested in knowing about me. So I'll tease you a little bit with my interests. I love soccer, it is by far my favorite sport. I play for my highschool team and some little rec leagues when the season isn't going on. I'm fairly decent at it also. Coach says I have lots of talent, I just need to get in better shape and stop being such a pussy (he is a great and encouraging coach). Today we had soccer practice at 7 p.m. and I wasn't last on one of our runs and I was happy and gave myself a pat on the back for a job well done. I also play tennis and just started my sophomore year. Tennis has been pretty fun and I had a good time playing even though I was second to last in the team rankings at one point during the season. Yeah I suck at tennis so what, as long as I'm better than sprint I'm cool with that. I'm also a huge fan of Incubus, I love their music and I have a couple of dvd's and most of their cd's. I am pretty selective about what I listen to, I mostly listen to: Incubus, Jack Johnson (he is a cool guy and his songs are totally boss), Pedro The Lion (very sad music which I listen to whenever I having problems), smile empty soul, kings of leon, lots of other alternative typ bands. I can't really stand country or rap or r or hip hop or ska and probably some other thing I've failed to recall.   Alright, well I'm very very tired and staying up this late or early or whatever isn't good for me. I'll finish this up as soon as possible. Besides this one post looks super long as it is and yeah that's it for now. see you later.
