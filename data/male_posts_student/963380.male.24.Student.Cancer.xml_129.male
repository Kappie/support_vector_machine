The emmigrators moved on to Alberta (you KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!! :) making my life a whole lot less busy and somewhat less interesting. Yes, that means I miss you. Shut the hell up.  My birthday came and went. I'm older. That's not a huge problem for me, I'm still mentally five years old. I've realized that I loathe people speaking in general terms about amorphous prinicipals while I'm trying to concentrate. In short, I need people to shut the fuck up when I'm trying to post. That means you mom. I'm a good child, I swear to god.  Finally got my car stereo installed in my car. John, the installer married Andrea - a girl I used to take the bus with in high school. She was and still is incredibly hot. I envy John, but I'll live.  Glennis (pronounced Glen-Iss, but spelled like Penis) is being a bit of a cockmonger at work. The past few days have been utterly priceless. Brownie is keeping track of how often he mentions his potential sterility to customers. We've also started a completely seperate but partially related tally of how often he tells customers he is going to get digital camera X, almost for free, cause I was fourth in Ontario last year quote endquote.  So we essentially have an egotist with a malfunctioning dick that somehow believes his life is relevant to someone elses, somewhere. I believe he's informing everyone in the rare occurance that someone might actually care - so far it's been a negatory.  I met a fellah not to long ago who looks like Agent Mulder. He's gay as the Jack of Diamonds, which kinda makes me chuckle. This kid, not Dave Duchovny. Dave is married to Tea Leoni, who is explicably and expressly hot, which I presume inferentially proves his utter lack of gayness.  Arnold is running for governor. I would vote for him without hesitation; even when the competition includes such sizable rivals as Gary Coleman.  BLACKOUT 2003 came and went. I was suffering from the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had (still am actually, props to Slamber who said it could last a month - 24 fucking hours my god damn burning asshole) - it appears Ohio is to blame, therefore Ontario > Ohio. Suck it up Drew Carey.  A good point was just made to me. At least if Glennis is sterile, he won't spread.  I hooked my Xbox up to my Big screen. that's really where it belongs. It's sexy over there. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is much much more of a game than Episode I or II were movies. It's a god damn fucking shame that Lucas' brain has been asphyxiated by the parasite that's slowly eating his body. If he had a drop of creative sense, this is the movie he would made. The only thing that makes me sad is that there isn't a dark force power labelled "Kill Kitten". I suppose I could use the regular  Kill power and direct it at a local kitten, but something specific really would have filled that void.  Glennis does have one redeeming quality, if I were dying in a raft, his corpse would feed me for many weeks. Quoth me. Thankfully he doesn't wear spandex. At least not that I can see.  That's some of what I have for you for now. I shall return, much like the Dark Knight, though with a hell of a lot less hot Robinchick and Battank.
