It's got a gr8 community(not to mention if you refer me when you get on, i get more therebucks!), races, paintballing, i might even let you borrow my hoverpack for a while. So sign up!  No, I don't work for There, Inc.  urlLink There.com!   Anyway... uhh... i think i've talked about everything i've been thinking about in recent posts, the most exciting thing i've done today is filter out the Bilge tank in the boat- almost hit my dad with the water when i turned it on! hahahahahah.  Well, i guess that's it for now, I'll post back later today if i have any more independent thoughts.
