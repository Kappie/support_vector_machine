'I never said I'd take this lying down,' and i won't there are people that i never want to let go of, things i want to forget but people who have stood there, never questioned, and still held my hand. I've never really realised untill ive missed it but seeta was the best friend i never thought i had, i guess i was too caught up wishing for more, i still am but i guess now its not there as much, im starting to miss the real things. oh well. im realising now as im leaving what a jerk ive been to people, you all know who you are, and im sorry. ive found friends in the last month that im just gonna lose.  this is a bit of a depressing entry.I had my german speaking today, which was complete bollocks, my presentation wasnt long enough, so i had 7 minutes of question, in which i managed to use the entire english dictionary, and 2 minutes of total silence. geeze. mailed the kkk today, told em what racist jerks they are. in this world we shoudlnt care whos got what colour skin, but what we should all do so that we can see another sunrise.  the words drip like honey, i guess this means something, to someone pleading,  to sing more sad songs, you start to feel cold like, the ashes on my bed, is what i said or didnt say, that kills you so slowly,  chorus well i guess this hurt more the first time, i hope you know, I'm not pretendingX2
