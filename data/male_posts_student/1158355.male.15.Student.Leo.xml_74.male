Let's see all the special things that happened, I went to Carvel, Paul announced he's not fuckin having a party after all so I can't perform with my concert for an actual audience. Have fun in Boston...)= Well, my band is still having a band practice tomorrow and maybe I'll sleep at Michaelis' tomorrow. Nothing good happened today, damnit... well I played drums for like 2 hours that's good but everything else sucked.  "Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it. You're going down, this is a war."
