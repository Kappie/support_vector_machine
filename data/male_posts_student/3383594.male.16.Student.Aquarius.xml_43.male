After that we went to west mall juz to walk around. Apparently some Chinese Band called F.I.R was there for an autograph session. Well, obviously the place was packed, realli packed. West Mall was never this packed b4. The crowd was juz overwhelming and LOUD. They simply went nuts when F.I.R arrived, screaming like they never screamed b4. Well, it was cool as I never thought West Mall will ever be sucha attraction. L0L! Apparently I'm wrong. The place was juz flooded wif ppl. It was hard to move around and when the 1st storey couldn't contain every1, the rest went up to another storey. The queue was like all the way outside the shoppin centre and it continued in circles and circles and circles and circles and circles. Yea, I had to squeeze my way outta there to get home. L0L!  Anyway today was a pretty slack day. I spent my time in school slackin and wastin time. There was basically veri little work to be done today. L0L! After sch, I was supposed to play pool wif Anwar, but I felt like watchin a movie. It was a pretty complicated situation seriously. So anyway, Wei Qiang wanted Sian Yang to meet him at the hawker centre opposite the school, so I went wif Sian Yang to find Wei Qiang. At the hawker centre, we had lunch and checked the movie timeslot. We realised tt the time wasnt suitable as the earliest was 5pm. In the end, I didnt play pool or catch a movie. Hmmm, well the gd thing is tt I saved my money! L0L! Anyway, Sian Yang spotted Lynn frm the hawker centre. Apparently, she was walkin to Clementi Interchange wif a fren. He got pretty excited and started chasin after them, so me and Wei Qiang followed. We mixed and mingled wif them all the way. Lynn's fren took a bus home, while the rest of us went on to the MRT station. There are some quick observations I made bout Lynn. First of all, she's fairer than me. Secondly, she's veri naive. She believed tt I wasnt Singaporean. Nvm bout' tt cuz Sian Yang spat out the truth. L0L! But the thing is tt she's pretty sociable and tt's a good thing.  Speakin of observations, I realised tt I hafta do my F observations shitz now. Damn, it's boring and tiring, but it's life. Oh well, guess I'll hafta stop crappin here for today. Cya soon~! =]
