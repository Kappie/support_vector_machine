I had fun  and  got to wear a kilt four out of eight days. We had great teachers too, such as bagpiping notables (they're actually  urlLink listed  as such) as Angus J. MacLellan and Mark Wygent, along with excellent teachers and performers Lyric Todkill (that is such a great name) and Patrick Regan, my teacher.  Some time soon, I can post some .mp3s of me playing, just because I'm that cool.   Cool Link for Today :   urlLink http://alphabetizer.com/   Worth adding to your Favorites.
