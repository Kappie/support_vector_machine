(They even have a level called hell :), which I haven't gotten to yet)  Many a times I've yelled and jumped out of my seat because of this game.  And the atmosphere and noises alone will keep you on the edge.  This game stresses me out..seriously, I'm really tense while I play.  OMFG it is the best.  Anyway, here's some screenshots.   urlLink http://server6.uploadit.org/files/logen99999-wallwriting.JPG   urlLink http://homepage.ntlworld.com/matrix787/Doom3/Doom3%20(26).jpg   urlLink http://bmxrenegades.com/yabbse/attachments/8.jpg   urlLink http://bmxrenegades.com/yabbse/attachments/4.jpg   Best game ever.  Yes, this is all I have to talk about because this is all I've been doing lately.  Jeebus I need to go riding or something..or maybe I just need to play more doom and forget about all that..hmm...:)   I'm wierd.  (IE)
