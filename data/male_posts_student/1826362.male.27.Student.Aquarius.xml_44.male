It should have a great kitchen with a gas stove, a large refridgerator, plenty of storage space, lots of counter space, and a dishwasher.  It should be cheap.   I've decided that I don't like roomates.  I don't want one or three.  I don't want a male rock star.  I don't want a female librarian.  I don't want a cat lover or a neat freak. I don't want a loner who dissapears into his room at 5.  I don't want someone who wants to tell me about his day at work, his trouble with his boyfriend, or the rash on his back. I want to know that when I leave something somewhere, it will still be in the same spot when I get home.  I want to walk around naked.  I don't want to be reminded of bills or the expiration date on the milk.  I want to leave dishes in the sink for a week.  I want to clean everything with bleach.    I want to use dial up internet service for hours and hours.  I want to make a diet coke can pyramid.  I want to escape the tyranny of other people.  I want to exist in a cocoon of individuality.  Like Superman's fortress of solitude.  I want to stay up till four in the morning reading ts eliot.  I want to play jazz and cook bacon at 9 in the morning and read the newspaper all day in my boxer shorts.
