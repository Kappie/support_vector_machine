Edwards has been accused of sheltering his income in a way to avoid paying $600,000 in 'taxes'.  In fact, all that Edwards did is incorporate his business as an S Corporation, which is a standard practice in professional practices.  An S Corporation provides a liability shield on personal assets, and also allows 'pass through taxation', meaning that the corporation does not pay taxes on dividends, so Edwards takes his compensation and then pays taxes as an individual.  This way, Edwards doesn't have to pay Medicaid taxes on dividends.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with this.  It's smart, and the right thing to do.  I'd rather see us be fair to Edwards on this one and hammer him on legitimate issues.
