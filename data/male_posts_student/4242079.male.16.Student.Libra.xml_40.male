It wasn't really all that disturbing, and I don't see the point of this hoo-ha that has been going on lately concerning her work. She's an artist, and this is her way of getting her message across. So deal with it.   I apologize to those of you who actually visit my site (which isn't many, I know), for my recent...neglect. I've been working on this new and fantastic site for most of the time I spend online. I sincerely apologize if any of you were upset by this absence, although I'm sure it cause little, if any grief on your part. I just really haven't had all that much to say. All around me I see change, it really, I have no opinion on it. Edward and Miranda. I don't understand those two. I'm sure they were married long ago, and have gone beyone that "happy couple" stage. Now I'm almost certain there in their mid-life crisis. Almost menopausal of them. Ashlyn and Brian. I've been informed that they're all but engaged. Good for them. It's an interesting match to say the least, but by no means a bad match. I suppose those are the kinds or relationships that are the best though, the kind where you never thought they'd end up together. It's those kinds of relationships that last because they were founded on friendship. Not alcohol or looks or clothes or any other factor. Just friendship. And that is what is most important in a relationship, is friendship. Sean and Leah...they're getting married soon as well. June or July...I don't quite remember the exact date. It doesn't seem that long ago that I went to cadets, but ended up skipping it with Sean. I think I was in about grade 7. We walked around downtown Red Deer, eating Subway and McDonalds. Those were the days when I didn't give any thought to the rest of my life. I could just go day by day, watching the world spin around me. I was by no means still, though. I was a raging whirlwind of hormones and rage. And then there's Crystal and I. The original plan was to buy her a ring with part of my inheretence money from my deceased great grandmother, and give it to her this summer after she graduated. That plan when down the toilet after one of her little spells when she told me she didn't know if I was the one, if she really knew that she wanted me around forever. So, if you look at it in one way, I am, at this very moment, typing on her engagement ring, becuase I spent that money on this computer instead. It's really kind of depressing. But when I think about Brian and Ashlyn, Sean and Lea, Eddie and Miranda...I know that I'm not ready for that yet. I know that Crystal is amazing, and I know that I want her forever...but I'm not ready for that commitment yet. Even being engaged...usually you set a date, and the deadline would drive me nuts. I'm not ready for that yet. If you do get engaged, but don't set the date right away, I can see it becoming easier and easier to put it off as time goes on. It only takes 3 months of living together to become common-law husband and wife, and in today's society, what else do you really need? Yes, I think it would be better to be able to know the date as soon as you become engaged. Does this make sense to anyone?
