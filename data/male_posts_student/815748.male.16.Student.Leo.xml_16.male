I'm doing fate, by the way.  I'm going to have an amazingly gouda argument.  I ALso know a gouda counter-argument, which I devised because it would be very depressing if we were just part of a cause-and-effect, set universe.  Not to brag, but it is my informed opinion that the opposing side is kind of  at a disadvantage because they don't have me.  If you haven't ALready heard, I didn't win the SFA election. I don't feel TOO bad, because Matt didn't win either, and I had no doubt that he would.   Eh.  At the first Mock Trials meeting, Alex Turner (who I suggested should be a podium) and John Garabedian were there, which was gouda.  It was virtuALly just a big promotionAL speech, which was very boring, and they said Mock Trials would be one's entire life if one got to be a lawyer, which was bada.  I'll still try to get a position, though.  I reALly should be getting to bed, so this is AL, signing off.
