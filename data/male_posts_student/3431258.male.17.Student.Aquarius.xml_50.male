Decided to give  Half Life  a quick spin, to remember how much it was a boring game. Did the single player part until that monster in the silo area. Also played a bit of  Specialists 2.0  with custom guns i downloaded yesterday.   Went to the kitchen to have lunch. After eating i watched t.v a bit.(Pretty Rare) 2 awesome movies were playing :  Predator  and  Predator 2 . I watched both of them and went back on the net to check my mails, so nothing special.   Today is my last day connected to the net until i'm back from  Canada . I will probably advise some peoples on  msn  of what is gonna happen. Can't wait to be at the appartment!  Regards,  Zephyr
