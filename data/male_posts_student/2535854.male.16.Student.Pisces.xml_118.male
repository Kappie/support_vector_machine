Well Farouqs parents werent coming but they knew his results.Afandi`s excuse was damn funny.He said he told him mom only that morning in the car as she was sending him to school.He very well knew she had a function and said nevermind,she can come and collect his report card the next report card day.and she asked when is it and he replied "after the year end exams" and she asked when is that,he said "in a few months".Walaumak!What a fucker wei!And his results were awful.Haha.When he tells it,its like so funny.Aheheh.
