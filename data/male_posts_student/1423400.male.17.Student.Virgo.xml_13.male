To be honest, my images of her are fading fast, and the only reason why I would want to see her right is now it to satisfy my memory and curiosity. No idea what i'm going to do yet, I guess i'll wait to see if she writes or calls back first. Yeah, I miss her. But what can I do about it, i've already started moving on. I've heard the phrase "don't worry, there's plenty of fish in the sea." Well, that may be true, but how many of them will I be able to catch, when I don't know what bait to use? I believe some of it is luck, and being at the right place at the right time. Hahaha, of course with me, it's always being lost in the middle of nowhere at any time. It's not that im not attractive enough, have personality or esteem issues, its just a matter of having the luck. I'm sure i'll catch a break soon enough, all patterns begin somewhere and eventually end.  _______ lied to me, and I think she's purposely avoiding me; because I know she lied, I know how selfish it was of her to do so and she probably feels ashamed. Boy some people... I always sensed she was mentally off, but tries to act stable.  Bleh, had work again today. It actually went pretty fast, working with Stephanie and Jen. I swear none of the faces I serve will I ever remember again, they just don't stick; i'd be useless after witnessing a robbery or something. I do know this one young woman, soy-milk decaf latte; she has wavy brown hair, a nice smile and just looks absolutely adorable. She's not as some may categorize as 'hot' but she is charming in a sweet way. I know all the 24 flavours we have on rotation...yay me! I'm starting to get the hang of this biz. I served this cute girl and her friend, and I was thinking where do I know her from. I asked her, "did you use to work at gulliver's grill?" and her face lit up as she looked up at me and exclaimed in surprise. She didn't recognize me in my spiffy new uniform; turns out Hayley is working at milestones now. She's a really sweet girl, that's one of the things I miss about gulliver's, all the servers and hostesses. Perhaps i'll return to the restaurant scene as a server myself when I turn 19. Note to self: Get in touch with Kimberly sometime.  My god, is anyone else worried about the age kids begin to desire sex appeal? These two girls who were barely 12 were wearing crop-tops and short-shorts, it really weirded me out. Another strange thing I saw was this couple, a girl who looked 13 with this guy who was at least 19 or 20. I had to try so hard not to look weirded out.  I am absolutely obsessed with having to buy some crazy gadget/mp3 player/cellphone these past few weeks. www.gizmodo.com has only been fueling that obsession with random things of no real purpose. The new iPods were released on monday. I'm reluctant to get one still, because of lack of additional features, like fm radio/recording, and extended file support. However the 12 hour battery life makes things a bit more appealing, just a bit. Which leads me into this week's cool thing of the week!  The palmone treo is looking mighty fine nowadays with its impeccable multi-day battery life...except it lacks the following: bluetooth connectivity, and a megapixel camera. Sorry but 0.3 mp just doesn't cut it. Oh yeah...and the fact that it costs freaking $800 puts a damper on my spirits. But toss in a 3.0 camera and bluetooth and I am SO sold. Whew...what a long post.  urlLink     urlLink
