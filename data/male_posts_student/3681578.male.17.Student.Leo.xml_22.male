(Sorry kung corny...lol)  Well...change topic...ayaw ko na ng orgs...  About kanina...the play Enemy of the People...[note disclaimers ahead...]  It was not as bad as I thought it would have been...talk about sarcastic huh?!...anyway, it was kinda nice...ok, I'd dare say I enjoyed it...It was not terri-terrific...but it was nice...  The thing about it that I like was the way TA adapted the play...the roles were well-played, I'm impressed actually...nice set and props...nice lighting and effects...  I just didn't like the way the setups were planted...I mean, they could have done it better...like making the actors seem like audience by lining up and not having to place special chairs for them...that way made it kinda scripted...too-scripted that it was not nice...but overall...the play went fine...  I do hope I can watch the opening game on sunday if and only if there are still tickets...  So there...I'd better sleep...I have INTACT on Bel-311 tomorrow...and my friends say its just GD...as in GD...as in GD...   ZzZzZzZz
