I feel that there are vast improvements that can be made to increase efficiency in the workplace.  I feel that these healthcare entities will be the most responsive and eager to change.  I believe in using technology to streamline business.  I also believe in having an educated staff who now their job and the role that it has in the overall mission of the facility.  I feel that simple changes in equipment and training can be the best investment a facility can make.  I will continue to post new ideas about improving the structure and procedures in the healthcare field as well as some interesting problems that come up along the way.  Changes bring about ethical questions that can not always be answered quickly and easily.  The goal is to continue learning.
