This is sad. What's more sad than that? The guy who's supposed to read it hasn't written back about my proposal yet. That's pretty darn sad. Sadder still? How about writing paying $50 application fees to colleges that don't tell you if you're accepted? Handsome people like me can't get a break nowadays.
