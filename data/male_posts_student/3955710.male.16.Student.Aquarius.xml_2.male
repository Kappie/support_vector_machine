Yeah. Please go on this website for some real brain gymnastics.       urlLink http://www.rotten.com/library/religion       And then scroll down and click on  Quantum Physics  for advice how to phone your future self. Strange like a lemming in the desert.      Question: Does anyone know what metaphysics actually is?      In other news, I almost had a emotional breakdown last nite because of my crap life but in the end I didn't. For me my depression isn't like a black dog, it's more of a black curtain which goes down over my eyes and everything gets dark. It's scary cos it gets worse and worse until it gets better. There's not too much to worry about at the moment, but then there is actually and I can't be bothered to explain it to you.      What a great blog it is! I could be all candid and confessional like Oli was in his blog, but I don't have the nerve to tell everyone what's going on inside my head.      I'm not sure why I chose the title today. It just sprang out of the air.      See Ya      THOM
