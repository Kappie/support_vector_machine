Jimmy my old manager is even more yucky than I thought he was 2. Anything that's not a star but has lights on it can be considered a UFO 3. If you do a little dance, a mosquito will just go away apparently 4. If you say any random word relating to color it'll make the smoke stop blowing towards you from a fire 5. Constellations are hard to find. (except for "that guy's belt" right Steph? :p)  Moving on to Sunday...  Got up, ate breakfast, did nothing. Waited for my mom's friends to show up.  When they finally got here, they followed us over to my godmother's house and we were there for like 2 hours.  Fun.  Went out to dinner.  Didn't have anything.  Got back here.  Did random things.  Went to sleep.  Here we are.  and I may have been slightly intoxicated last night so if I IMed you acting really weird you know why  --Aaron
