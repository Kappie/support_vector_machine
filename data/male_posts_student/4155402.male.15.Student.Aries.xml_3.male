Haiz.. sunday... its quite a good day today.. played two matches and lost the first one by a lil margin but won the second one like we are the god of cs.. man.. those pros really SUCKED.. we pwned em 13 - 2 like what??? Nak made up for my bludner during the first match as i wasnt really concentrating.. the second match we had EM , brian , zhi hao and those other pros as our opponents.. but we still managed to win.. haha.. we are the supreme!!!  Talked abt the possibilities abt us as frenz last nyt wif zh.. its quite scary how time can make frenz break up and make enemies.. how tym can make us realise what we did in the past are dumb things.. scary.. now i finally realised that i hav to cherish what i hab and not what i dun hab.. im now trying to cherish my family and frenz.. its no point crying and getting sad over things that are not meant to be urs.. ur gonna lose lotsa time... but i still cant help feeling sad.. but hey.. theres always an alternative right?? (how i wish that is sooo true...) gotta go now.. cya peeps
