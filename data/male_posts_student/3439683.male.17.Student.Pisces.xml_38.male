Got back from that camp this weekend. it wasn't bad, scenery was nice. my butt still hurts from the Hummer ride. Landed on Jordan's knee. We were going downhill, hit a three-foot mogul, I went up and he slid under me, and when I came down, well, you get the idea. The increased med's are giving me mood swings. Seriously, Saturday night, in less than ten seconds I went from laughing, joking around to crying. It was like that the whole weekend. Also, it's making me hyper, I can't stand that. if it gets worse when he increases the dosage, I'm gonna stop taking it. it's just not worth it if it's gonna make me like that. I cashed my change bag, I had about $80 in there. I needed the money, trust me. I wrote a new song, it's on my poetry blog. Check it out. oh, yeah, and in a couple of more paychecks, I should be able to afford an electric guitar, maybe even an amp.
