As interesting as it may be talking about going to and from work, I'll try to include more than just what cuts appeared on my hands at work or how sick I'm getting of packed lunches. I'll let you into the real me. You know, the part you knew was there, but always was afraid to ask.  Well, why don't I tell you about my day? Starting things off at 6:00 A.M. always leaves me bright and chipper, and this morning especially, my alarm scared the life out of me. I guess I must've turned it up accidentally. Next came the tough part of the day, 9.5 hours of work. The music really helps pass the day, without it, I believe I'd be going crazy. After work, I came home and showered and got myself all pretty and went and hung out with Jaclyn. We ate at Applebees and good times ensued. Preceding, I was planning to come home and play my guitar, but my tiredness gained control of me and I took a two hour nap (Which was interrupted by Sarah calling. Oh well, I'm not really a nap person anyways). Finally I decided to start this blog, which brings you up to the present.  Michael
