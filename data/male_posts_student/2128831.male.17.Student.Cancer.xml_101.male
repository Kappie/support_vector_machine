It’s half eleven at night, and all good wasps should be in bed. But this one was a rebel, an individual, a protestor against convention, so, as is usually the way of these things, it had to die. I emptied half a can of Raid at it and squashed it to a smear under the heel of my shoe. You may think this cruel, but wasps are evil and deserve everything they get. Imagine if wasps were the size of human beings. Just imagine. It was followed soon after by a daddy long-legs, but I didn’t care about that. Just as long as it doesn’t make off with any of my CDs.   The Bush Administration continues to shock and awe    I am yet in a state of shock and awe over the seemingly never ending revelations of highly undesirable realities that the Bush Regime is directly responsible for, including the brutal killing of Nick Berg; not so much owing to the behaviors, actions, and political maneuverings of Bush and his boys, nor the actions of the militant rebels, but to the widespread ignorance with which the average American citizen comprehends what has been taking place all along. There was a time when the only people not totally turned-off to the company of born-again Christians were either others who’ve been reborn, and those so lost and gullible that they willingly drink arsenic-laced Kool-Aide. Yet today, there sits in the Commander and Chief’s chair a born-again Christian who believes that he has been chosen by God to lead this historic grab at Global Rule, and people are okay with this! A raging dry-drunk on an ego-trip beyond his wildest dreams! I am disheartened, but not disillusioned, which me thinks the average American citizen is.    Oh Boy!  Of cell phones, signal quality, and loud voices.   I was watching TV today and saw this commercial for some company's wireless service. They were showing a train full of cell users with signal quality bars over their head and one guy had really bad signal. This guy was basically screaming into his cell phone. Now. There are 3 things wrong with this one. #1, I absolutely HATE people who yell into their cell phones. That's just a personal pet peeve. But #2 is that ALL modern cell phones are digital. Now if you didn't know, digital cell phones use error corrected packets of data to carry the voice signal. When the signal quality fades, the packets pick up large amounts of errors, and when the packets are too corrupted to correct, they are dropped. This causes breaks in the voice stream. Yelling will not prevent packet loss. #3 is the problem of over modulation. Basically because we're talking a digital stream, there is maximum limit to the sound intensity. If you go beyond this limit, the quantitizer maxes out and won’t go any higher. This leads to clipping (The squaring off of loud sounds) in the audio stream. But everyone seems to yell when they begin to loose signal. The part that confuses me ('cause I occasionally catch MYSELF doing it...) is WHY we do it... Ring ring!!!   More naughtiness:    A Good Way to Meet People. (Or) Panhandling in Suburbia. (Or) How To Get a Guy To Buy You Dinner.   Try, unsuccessfully, to walk through the drive-through of your local fast food joint. Ask the guy in the car behind you to order food for you. In exchange, you'll give him your credit card to pay for his food as well. Stand next to his window as he orders a late dinner for you, Person B and himself. Walk to the first window and try, unsuccessfully, to give him your credit card, while Person B vigorously searches her purse for money or a checkbook.  He'll look at you and say, "If you're hungry enough to try to walk through a drive-through, then this is on me."  Hand him a business card with "We owe you – me and Person B" on the back of it.  Laugh hysterically during the entire walk home, while eating your cheeseburger or salad if you are a vegetarian in Ben and my case.
