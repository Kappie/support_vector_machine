What's happening and what for!? Why would a man who has committed nothing wrong and not only that, who was giving valuable services to people who live far away from his home, get killed in such a barbarian way?? Why this extreme brutality and disgusting crime that has nothing to do with humanity and that doesn't fit with any religion or human morals? Why the persistence on using arms of the dark ages in this time and why insisting on spreading those pictures with the horrible details?"   Not all Iraqis hate us.  And it is nice to see the occasional Muslim speak out against those that hijack an entire faith.  As I've said before, we need to protect and amplify those willing to stand up against Theocracy.
