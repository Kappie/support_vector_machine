Know that they are now gone to a better place, whether you accept it or not.  They are away from all the terrorism, all the rapes, all the hate, and all the racisms of this world.    Like Tupac himself said, At worst, he is in a quiet place, by himself all alone.  At best… He’s an angel.  Death is so much more than you all make it seem.  Give it a second thought, a second opinion.
