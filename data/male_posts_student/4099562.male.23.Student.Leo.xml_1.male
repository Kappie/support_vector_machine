I'm fairly busy at the moment, what with my thesis and my "crazy"* social life. For those of you that care, here's how this month pans out  7th August: Mary's housewarming in Brighton. Picking Claire and Laura up on the way. 8th August: Last shift at the bar, will probably wake up still drunk and forget to come back home for this 10th August: VEGA interview 12th August: Hanne arrives from Norway, I think I'm supposed to be picking her up. 14th August: Back to the Future in Greenwich Park 15th August: Laura comes back with me to Cranfield for birthday. Double booked with Laurel taking me out to dinner. Oh crap. 16th August: Birthday. Possibly doing some work but mostly drinking. 17th August: Get up late.  Go back to parents to get car MOT'ed sometime around 19th August take Hanne back to Norway in Van. 19th August: on panic re: thesis 7th September: Thesis oral 10th September: Theis in 11th September: Move house 12th September: Visit Chris in Garmany 14th September: onwards on the dole.  All in all its a bit busy
