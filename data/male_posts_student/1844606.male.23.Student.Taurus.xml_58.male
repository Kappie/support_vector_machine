Things are pretty open ended as they stand right now, but I kind of like the poetic vibe I've got (or at least I think I do).  Sandals rhythmically slapping against heals, I follow her down the path.  Weather beaten logs act as steps and in the distance I hear waves crashing and can see the tops of white caps in the distance.  We settle in at our normal spot. The bluffs look like mirror images of the waves, water substituted for sand. Green grass peaks over the top like wisps of hair of a baby. A cove dips into the lake and sunbathers are stretched out as if they are in an amphitheater.  For the most part we are alone except for giggling kids a ways away. Adventurous kids, some who can't read the warning signs, and those who chose to ignore, climb on a man made isthmus of jagged rocks leading out into the waves. Neurotic mothers wave their hands in a helpless sort of way and scream for their child to come back in safely. The kids milk the situation and pretend to slip on the rocks, incensing the mothers and it draws a chorus of giggles from the co-conspirators who are wrapped up in challenging the incoming waves with broad motions with their hands.  Shrieks of children alert all to incoming waves and as they crash against the rocks. As the water retreats underneath the rocks, a slow slurping sucking noise is made sounding much like a belly swollen from drinking too much pop. I used to be one of those kids out there, but freedom ainâ€™t what it used to be. * * * The 4th of July used to be about the parades, the spectacle of deafening fire trucks, squad cars and marching bands, water guns, a hammock in a tree and a trampoline
