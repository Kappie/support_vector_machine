But of cos there are always areas that we can work on like making sure every stroke was 100% accompanied by the kicking of boat and the twisting of body.. Was highly motivated during the training despite the condition that i was in.. Panadol Actifast was good.. It took away my pain and the sickness for a short while. At least during the training.. With laoshi's comments on being able to win a medal.. We have high hopes.. Juz hoping that we can perform our best during the heats..   After training, me and xp went back to her house and cook maggie mee to eat.. haha.. was kindna broke le.. all thanks to the meal at Seoul Gardern.. lolz.. it was nice.. :D after which i felt kindna sick.. the effects of the paracetamol had worn off.. took 2 panadols and took cab home.. rest and rest.. zzz.. hope this illness will not undermine my performance tml..  Tml's the competition.. Its the heats of the Dragonboat Festival 2004 at Marina Promenade.. I'm going for the 24 men and 24 mixed competition.. Event 2 at 1.10pm and Event 17/23 at 3.40/4.40 i think.. not sure for the mixed boat..   P.S. History only remember the CHAMPS.. Runner-ups are nv remember.. I want to be remember.. I want to be the CHAMP..
