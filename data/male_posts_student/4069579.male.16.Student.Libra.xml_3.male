Well to tell you honestly, I could not sleep. What could be the reason for this? I just had my UPCAT test and now I should feel relaxed. Because it’s over. But no, there’s still another reason why I can’t sleep. My sub-conscious mind tells me to go online and check out my dear friend’s blogspot. I always think about this friend. maybe she's the reason i could not sleep. And indeed it was so timely that I saw what I needed to see.
