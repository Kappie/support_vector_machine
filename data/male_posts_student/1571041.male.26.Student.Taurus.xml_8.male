But, since I had those days cleared to use as days off, I went w/ the flow and stayed away from work.  Nothing really mentionable yesterday, aside from the everpresent heat that was unexpected.  It reached 90+ Degree Fahrenheit yesterday, and today too.  Okay, so I get back and find the last call back person has arrived.  This kid is cool as all heck.   Part Mexican and white I think?   He's just crazy to be around though.  We joke around a lot, and he meshes w/ the other workers too.  We fell back into our old ways of joking around nonchalantly, and laughing at our own immaturity.  He's going to school out in Seattle, and I also met the newest new guy on the crew who goes to school out in South Dakota somewhere?  We were supposed to do physical training this morning, but we had a class on working w/ pumps, both on and off trucks.  I think the one off rig is a mark (or Mach?) 3 pump?  I thought this was going to be dry and uneventful, but instead it ended up being pretty informative and interesting.  We did more hands on training instead of reading from a book or pamphlet while watching some outdated videos.  To top it off, out in the field we tried out a hose lay and stuff.  That was fine and all, but the instructor sabotaged some of the equipment.  So, we had to figure out what was wrong, fix it, and do what we were asked to do.  These types of things do happen out on the fireline what the instructor did to us, so it was interesting to see what happened.  Needless to say, we got through it all and got some praise for not losing our heads and not complaining out things.  Probably though, because we weren't aware these were purposely done.  After that, we all go on lunch.  I shoot a couple shots in the gym ( because this class was in the community center of that town ) and find the wonderment I was searching for all the time I was not trying to stay awake from monotone speeches about what is and isn't important for pumps,  the weight room .  Nothing spectacular, just an outdated weight set that has stacks of weights for bench, shoulder presses, and leg presses with some bars places for chin ups and dips.  But, there was a pull down machine, a bench, a curl bar, and some dumbbells.  I tried out the bench, first thing of course.  No warm ups at all, just straight 3 plates ( 315 ).  I managed one rep there, w/ very noticeable pain to accompany that effort on my part.  So, I go to pull downs, working the triceps.  No real pain there, but I notice the lack of work put on my big ole stomach and abs.  I'm kinda ashamed about the look I've developed, so I'm trying to get motivated to work on that part of my body sometime,  hopefully soon .  Then, I do some curls w/ the curl bar.  Nice, but could use more work.  I move to dips, and find I can still do those, w/ li'l notice of pain from my shoulder.  I try out  295  on bench, and manage 2 reps this time.  Again,  more pain , so I decide to leave the bench alone from that point on.  I do random sets of random reps for bicep curls, pull downs and dips from that point on.  I manage to call it a workout a couple minutes before class resumes.  When the class ends, we're all feeling alright, and we have about 2 hours of empty time.  Everyone lounges around, milking the clock for all it's worth.  I get to talking w/ the college folks.  We laugh about classes, money, and locations of schools.  Mostly I was cracking jokes about where I went,  SIPI , and they laughed more about things they've done at school.  It was odd though, talking to  a white guy, and a Mexican guy  about  college   without defending anything about where I went .  We know it's tough going through classes, tests, teacher's teaching styles, and trying to come up w/ some finances on our own to do things we want to do.  But, also, I was reading off some pamphlet about  "alcoholism, a treatable disease,"  or something to that effect?  A couple guys on crew, and a lot of those we all knew fit some descriptions in that pamphlet.  We laughed at that, but I wonder why it was so easy to do so, even though it is such a serious issue?  From there, though, the conversation took all different turns and twists, and we all forgot about school.  Did manage to notice that there are a lot of sioux natives on this ole colville rez.  A couple of them even live on the same street in town, but have never met each other?  I thought this was odd, but figure it's just a random set of events that will be corrected sometime down the road.  Tired though now, and might even go to sleep early tonight.  Yeah... Right...
