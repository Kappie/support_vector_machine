I only paruse it when I am bored, and torn between looking at that and looking at my once-glorious fantasy baseball teams, but since the baseballers ain't got no love since early June, I can't bring myself to look their way, so I log on to the 'ster and surf around, reading fairly dull, faux-glamorous synopses of twentysomethings who swim with the fashion current.  Yet I stop and take a closer look when they're A)  From Austin, B)  Hot, or C)  Both.  I'm not going to track these folks down because we both own copies of  urlLink Deep Breakfast ...in fact, by seeing them on  Friendster , the likelihood is that I would avoid any sort of meeting, the antithesis of the beta site's credo.  Yet I'm still fascinated at times, still surfing around, still checking out the locals, the hotties, and the local hotties.  One friend turns into 60,000, yielding sites like  urlLink this , that I'm not sure if I'm supposed to read or not.  Yes, she links to it, and yes, she's hot, but am I supposed to peek into her life as she sorts out her feelings about suicide just because she looked good in a buddy pic?  And then what?  I know some of her inhibitions, some of her fears, something quite personal, and I just cast the website away because she's young, not my bag, and not so great a writer?  Then there's  urlLink this girl , who in many ways I hope took these pictures off some amateur softcore site, but it's quite doubtful, and much more likely that it's her.  Exhibitionism is one thing, but when a need for attention spills into posting homegrown pics of yourself in states of undress, the problem seems manifest.  She reminds me of the girl I saw outside of McDonald's on the night of Bacchus during 1999 Mardi Gras, who was tracking guys down, kissing them full, allowing gropage of breasts and genitals, all for a handshake and a string of beads.  This girl had no friends with her...she just sat on the curb outside the closed Mickey D's, wearking a courduroy coat with a fur collar, eyes vacant of passion and full of fear, participating in the social ventures for no reason other than to pump up self image in the most derogatory way possible.    I do judge too easily.  Years ago I used to pride myself on my ability to psychoanalyze complete strangers after 5-10 minutes of conversation.  It was like palm reading, except I explained all issues in a way that involved some sort of sexual inhibition or problem with siblings.  I got facets right, but never people...I cannot be reduced to my dad's alcoholism (one thing that makes  Capturing the Friedmans  so great is that it uncovers multiple layers of complexity in the familial relationships...we don't associate just A with one character, B with another...) or my mom's nagging or my sister's uncompromising stances.  But I look at her and don't see an independent woman who is empowered by  urlLink Live Nude Girls Unite .  I don't write my post-porn screenplay yet because I can't write women.  Women were the best characters in my last two works, but only in their relations to the male protagonist.  The post-porn piece is more about the girl.  Can she stand on her own?
