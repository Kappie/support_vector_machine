The only drag of a thing is working 5 days this week, but since hanging out with friends, drinking, eating, and stuff cost money... 2 extra days of pay is a good thing.  I've been listening to lots of new music lately as well. Bessides discovering a new radio station... 94.3 Super Cool... I've been listening to some 88 Fingers Louie, Anti-Flag, Nicotine, White Stripes, Elvis, Four Tops, and Del Shannon. An interesting mix there eh?  I've noticed the whole garage sound is really getting kind of big. That's pretty cool stuff. There's just something about that sound. What I think would be really cool is if someone went back and brought back the sounds of doo wop and old Mo-town with a modern twist. Something like juxtaposing modern left politics with the retro sound of such a reactionary time?  In rotation right now is Anti-Flag's  Underground Network  (2001). I'm really digging the opening track, "Angry, Young, and Poor."  ****
