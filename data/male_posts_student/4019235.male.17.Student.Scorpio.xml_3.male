But noooooooooo, PsychoTeh wanted to keep us in shape, and he goes at length to make us suffer. I so want to rip his head off. Both his heads! Man! Looks like I have hell ahead of me. What is worse? Having PsychoTeh’s P.E or having P.E on an empty stomach, that after a fucking run, I felt so weak and sapped. Now I know what low blood sugar patients feel like.                   Enough of the melancholy, I bring good news. The prelims are still 13 weeks away. Wow, that is bloody long time. Long enough to keep me suspended in a daze anyway. 2 weeks per subject, reasonable? Okay, lets hope I don’t say “I have 1 week per subject” later on in the school term. Hey! 12 weeks is a long time u noe.                           I think I’m wasted, I’m talking shit and hallucinating about school-less life again. Man! These dreams I have on some nights are para-fucking-dise. Yesterday, I thought I was with this hot girl I thought I saw on a cover of Maxim. Whoa, I had forgotten most of the details already, but when I woke up this morning. Heck, big morning glory. Haha.     Sorry, had to say that.                   Looking forward to tonight I guess. Lol, duh! Well, this mundane existence has been made more bearable with such nightly experiences.
