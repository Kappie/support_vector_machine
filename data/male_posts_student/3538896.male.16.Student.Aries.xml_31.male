Trying to recall on what had happened on Saturday, erm... hehe... nothing much either... hehe... jus went out for basketball and arcade as always... but i feel its really meaningfull coming out every week as it keeps us in contact... right KaiChin?? hehe... of course to Dilyse too... i suppose we 3 are always to be together always wherever we go... agree?? hehe...  Ahh... Sunday... a lot of things happened... I specially woke up at about 9am to prepare myself for the church i always looked forward for... hehe... but my parents din know about it... i told my dad i went jogging which turned out to be going for a walk as my dad wanted to bring me to sembawang park for *my jog*... hehe... haiz... when my dad got my dog for a walk, i somehow *sneak* out of the house... hehe... went to Lorraine's house as planned to change my clothes... Den headed for the church... When i got back home which is about 12pm, my dad wasnt home at all... i was still worrying about my clothes which i was lazy to change back and the *sweat* i was suppose to have after a jog... hehe... lucky me dad wasnt at home... i called him and learnt that he was at the *rock world* having a picnick... so just told him that i got myself ready as in i *change* my clothes and went down... hehe... *got out of trouble through the lie* After that, we went to Sun Plaza... i was so so happy... i dunnoe why i felt happy but i am jus... glad... maybe because of the church i went to which satisfied me... hehe... so happy that i even bought a clothe for my brother which cost up to $19.90... my dad said i must be having a fever to have said that... hehe... back to the car where my dad sent us home, he asked me again on the reasons i bought the clothe for my brother... i couldnt say i was... happy because... my dad would further think that i am crazy... so i made up a story and tell him the truth about the church after telling him not to be angry when i told him the truth... i told him that the church taught us kinship (which din teach at all) and i learnt how impt it is... which is another lie la... or i couldnt get out of the question... hehe... thats what special happened that day...  Bout monday and yesterday, school was as for normal... bored lor... and i was somehow rushing on my D and T folio which was supposed to hand in on this thursday which is the day after tommorrow... haiz... now, sitting beside me... a war going on... a *fight*... haiz... now the small guy waiting for his *opponent* to get out of school before they start to fight again as the fight jus now was somehow calmed down by Miss Yuliana... haiz... stupid...
