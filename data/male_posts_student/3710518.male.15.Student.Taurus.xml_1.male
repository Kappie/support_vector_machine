To tell u the truth i have soooo  much to talk about but most of it i dont realy wanna say  so ill say the stuff i can. Today was allright i guess, i wasnt as depressed as i was  yesterday, thats mostly cuz i was up till like 11 pm last  night speaking to meeka on da phone.   i went to the beech westerday, god it was soo boring, but  it have me a chance to listen to the audio book i  downloaded of queen of the damed, it was pritey kool, man  vertually all vampires are gay, whats up with that?    anwyays i woke up this morning with the words pain in my  wrist, i still have it now and its killing like hell,  first up today i had visual arts and i couldnt fukin do  anything cuz my wrist hurt, at recess i just sat with  megan and tim in the library while megan sat there cutting  out these little multicolored stars. yeah i got kinda  bored just sitting there but it wasnt like there was  anything better to do.   i had math next and i had a fukin test , to my surprise i  ddint do as bad as i though i would do, lol, but thats  partially becuase me maida and bec were exchanging  answeres, the teacher didnt care he was helping au and  telling us how to do it anyways. after math i had computer  and i was so tired so i just sat there and closed my eyes  and day dreamed.   at luch i sat with megan, tim, aaron, and some other  people. megan was cutting out those damn stars again. i  was bored so i picked up the scraps that megan was cutting  and i licked one side and stuck them all over my face,lol.  damn i was bored.   after lunch i went to the toilets to get changed for sport  and i felt the depression kicking in again so i just  chaned my shorts and then just sat on the toilet  seat,everything was peacefull and quiet untill ben and  chris cam in i chould tell it was them just i heard there  voice, i kept sitting there as they started to get  changed in another cubicle. hmm.. and then they started  talking about me, why were saying this crap and i just got  pissed off and left.   my mum is making me peel the god damn potatoes so ill write more later.
