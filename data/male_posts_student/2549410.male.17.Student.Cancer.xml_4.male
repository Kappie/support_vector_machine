Well I told him I was going to tell him the many ways I love him .. this might be kind of long but i'll try to make it as short as i can ok everyone but this is mostly directed at christian. Hey sweetie well you already know the many ways I love you because I tell them to you practically everyday but I'd rather put it in writting where you can come read them whenever you want MUAh .. the reasons I love you are because you have made me very happy, You always find ways to make me smile, I know I can trust you very very much, You always seem to find a way to make me fall for you even more, And things of that nature .. SAY AWW EVERYONE .. heres some questions that I was asked.  Do you love him? I DO Would you die for him ? I WOULD What is he to you ? My monkey butt , Guardian angel, piece of heaven What would you relate him to?Why? A puppy, because hes soft, cuddly, warm, cute, and a lot of fun to play with Whats you two's song?

April 24th of course How do you feel about your relationship? Very happy ... I have no complaints we have had ups and downs but thats only made me fall for him even more How tall is your boyfriend? 6 feet. IF you could dedicate a song to him which song would it be? It would most likely be more than one song .. which would be Unchained Melody, Overjoyed, You're Mine, and Always and Forever If you were to die what would you tell your loved one at that time? I would tell him Since the first day I meet him I practically fell head over heals (although I dont wear stiletos) and that he'd be my first, my last, and my only   I LOVE YOU ...
