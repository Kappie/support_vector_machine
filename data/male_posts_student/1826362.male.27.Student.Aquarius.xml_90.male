Like when you really want cake, and the person passing out the slices gives you your piece first, and you feel lucky an special.  But it's also really short and dissapointing, like when they finalkly give out the last piece of cake to the last person who has been waiting patiently but thinking impatiently, and you have already finished your piece of cake an you are looking around jealously at everyboy who still has cake left.  Or does that just happen to me?
