This week is Blogger week, so all this week check out tips to make your Blog look even better, and I'm also going to throw in a couple Photoshop tips if I get around to it.  The new design is here, now all I need to do is get that new name thought up of, and we'll be set.  And now, onto today's site of the day, which is going to be the re-review of 1up.com, which got a bad score last week, and deserves a better score.  1up.com recently relaunched last week with an all new design, and an all new content system, and the site looked better than ever before, don't get me wrong, but, the site had some bugs in it, and it was making it look kind of bad.  There are two main reasons that I scored this low when I reviewed it last week, and they are:  A. Because images wouldn't load. 2. Because the message board users can be stupid, a lot.  But, they appear to have been working on the situation, and they have made the site's appearance look better, and now everything works just fine.  Images are loading great, though, the message boards are still full of idiots sometimes (but, they follow other sites like IGN and GameSpot who have tons of them on their boards, too).  The main attraction at 1up.com now is the user interactivity.  With a little more time to discover what the deal is really about at the site, I made the decision that this is one of the better gaming sites around.  Here are just a couple things that I like about the user-interactivity.   -Arena: Rate pictures that people post, and get points for them. -Clubs: You can start your own club, join it, and have a club journal, message board, and other things, including your own URL on 1up.com. -Collection: You can build your gaming collection on 1up.com.  While this still isn't as good as the collection builder on IGN, its still a pretty cool attachment. -Blog: You can create your own blog on 1up.com.  Don't expect to see bagel.tech there though.  I'm too addicted to teh Bl0gg3r!    There's all sorts of other things that make this site great, including the content.  1up.com is owned by Ziff Davis Publishing, who creates several gaming magazines like EGM, GMR, and Computer Gaming World.  They have their content so where you can read articles that are in the magazines, and then 1up.com's original content.  It's a great idea for people who think about subscribing to their magazines, and it will make up their mind.    Overall, I think I was completely wrong about giving 1up.com a bad score, when it really did deserve better.     Pros  +Great User-interactivity +Great content +Sweet design that now loads correctly   Cons  -Still can be slow at times    Score  Fun Factor: 95%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 95%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  96.25%- A GOLD   And now, on to today's second site review, GameHouse.com:   The Lowdown  Gamehouse is not another gaming site.  No no...it's a site where you can play games, like Collapse, Text Twist, and others, right on your computer.  Unlike Yahoo, Gamehouse actually created the games that I just mentioned above, and it looks great.  They are one of the leaders in game creation on the whole wide interweb, and every game has a level of uniqueness to it.  They have a lot of word games, like Word Flip, WHATword, and Text Twist, as well as Collapse and other games.    The thing that I like about GameHouse, is that if you are a fan of the games that GameHouse makes, you can play them all, and find other games that they have made, that may not be featured on sites like games.yahoo.com or Uproar.  Plus, you can sign up for their newsletter and get a free "super game."   This site is awesome, and it's definitely a fun one for anyone who is looking for a good game to play online.     Pros  +More Games +Nice Design   Cons  -Some games do suck, despite the fact that its GameHouse.   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 90%-A Customization/Controls: 88%-A Final:  92%- A    Up Next: Today's Download of the Day, Xfire Messenger
