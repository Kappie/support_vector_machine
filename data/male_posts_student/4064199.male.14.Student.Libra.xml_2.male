I've bought us a nice ship, and in about 1 hour we will be able to fly is ^_^. That's because that's when the skills will finish updating. That ship cost 14,000 Credits, and took me about and hour or two to get all that money.   Plus, if you start playing this game, don't let the auto pilot go unnoticed!! It's very very useful!  Oh yes, and the reason I didn't post yesterday, is cause it was identical to the day before, nothing happend.
