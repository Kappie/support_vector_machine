As you could probably tell, yesterday i was very frusterated and angry at all the computer problems that i was experiencing.  Well, today, instead of being frusterated and upset, i just tried my hardest to fix the problems that were at hand, and i did.   Well, first to my laptop.  Yesterday, Windows XP borked itself, and it wouldn't start up.  So, i did a handy system restore, and got it too the point where it was like i had just opened the box that contained it.  So, then i shut it down, and left the XP install till today.  On my desktop, i did many things that worked for other people to fix my nvidia drivers/xserver issues.  Nothing worked.  I mean, the newest drivers wouldn't even build.  Just before i shut it down last night, i paid another quick visit to the gentoo forums, searched for 4K stacks, and found a thread i found interesting about how you could get the nvidia drivers straight from the site.  I figured the files that i got from emerging were borked like the alsa files that i got.    Well, today, after eating breakfast and doing my morning piano, i installed Win Xp on my laptop, and installed about 15 programs, as well as doing windows update.  Well, the came church.  After church, i came home, and finished doing stuff on my laptop (which is doing an initial Norton virus scan) and i moved on to fixing my desktop.  Well, got the file from the nvidia site, and tried to build it.  It said something about the kernel not being in the directory, and therefore failed to build.  Then it hit me, the kernel i was using 2.6.7-r9, was too new for the nvidia drivers, and therefore none of them would work.  So, i promptly started researching kernels, and i found out that i could emerge the latest stable version of 2.6.7 another way.  So i did, and configured it.  Then, i booted it up, got the nvidia drivers, changed some config files, and it worked!!    Wooooooooooo, i'm so happy right about now!  I've had enough of linux for today though, i'm in XP currently, and am researchin iDesk for linux.  Cool little widget/icon thing.  Yeah.  The funny thing is, i got the new kernel to use my sound.. but i have no sound files to test if the new kernel with ALSA works.  Lets hope i don't run into more errors.   Lates
