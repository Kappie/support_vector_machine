Entertaining thoughts that I've the strength of those I yearn to be. Cheers and tribute greet the saviours. Reckless thoughts survive. Anachronistic and impulsive.  And what will happen? Will I dream? I am too scared to close my eyes. For a second please hold me. None can change in me these things that I believe. But I don't know what happens now. I am too scared to close my eyes.  © VNV Nation
