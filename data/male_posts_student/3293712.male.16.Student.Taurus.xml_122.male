After leaving Mr. Wanningers class I realized that I haven't really created anything with the knowledge that I obtained in that class, so I wrote a poem.  I tried to go as deep within myself as I could and this is what I came up with.  (feel free to analyze my poem in your blog)           PAIN  I feel it, the pain, it's running down my side. The blackness, the bane coming forth to consume me. Little voices in my head are driving me insane, always urging me: "do it, do it." Like little drops of rancid rain they fill me up inside. I swirl and swell without a drain, my seams will surely break. It is only I who know it though, it's entirely my strain; My outsides show no signs of grief. Therin lies the problem, I'm not a child plain. Why should someone help me, a child with a brain? Will I float or will I sink, when my sorrows fill the brim? When the vein pops I'll be slain only if it pleases Him.  That's all for today, ponder long and hard.
