Then like went to Mid Valley for a while..gave the Windows Recovery diskette to Yusri,the uy who`s fixing up my desktop...he says that the hardware seems to be fine..its just that the software is a bit screwd perhaps,so he`s re-installing windows..So gave the computer passwords to him so he could copy the files cause all will be lost of you use the recovery diskette just like that and stuff..I hope only the software is screwed...but it was long due for fixing up soon anyway..so nothing much else for me to say about this subject...  Then went to Pelita for dinner...had err naan  tandoori..not bad..maybe the naan wasnt that nice but boleh tahan la..Woah man..Porto wei on fire man...Carlos Alberto..Deco!,Alenitchev..shit man..my Porto choice team is more like...Baia,Valente,Jorge Costa,Ricardo Carvalho,then Dmitry Alenitchev,Costinha,DEco!,Maniche,McCarthy,Jankaukas and ewrr who eh ah..Ah!Paolo Ferreira..only Jankaukas isnt a regular..just dont like Derlei much...
