I spend a few hours most days trying to get a damn template I like in working order so people can comment on my blog, and it's terrible going.  Because of that, I don't write on this blog.  And I spend so much time grabassing with it.  Grabassing...a great verb.  Someday it will come along.  2)  Grabass is the order of the day for the next two weeks.  Yes, I ought to sub and make some cash, and I ought to pack, but it's more fun to go out like I'm going to write, and instead dick around with my website or, better yet, not dick with the website and rather play EverGrab.  Chinua is 30, Xhosa 20.  BTW, my characters are all black martyrs, political movements, or representations of the struggle against Apartheid.  The kiddies who play games have got to learn somehow.    3)  Odd dream a few nights...actually, a lot of odd dreams...I'll briefly describe those I remember:        A)    I'm driving past Marjorie Lyons Playhouse at Centenary, when Bob Buseick runs outside to his car.  I try to avoid him, but he sees me.  He is wearing a Dignan jumpsuit a la  urlLink Bottle Rocket , and suddenly we're in the green room at the playhouse, sitting Indian Style.  He looks at me and says, "You are a great talent.  I never want to see you again."  I shake his hand, and he leaves, with me asking him why.        B)   I'm in Melia Woods' dorm room, a la February 1998 when I travelled up there to make out with her and see if we had a future together.  The relationship was never consummated, and she mentions this.  So we decide to.  But as we start, her old boyfriend Ronnie Crupper walks in.  Melia says, "Why not a threesome?"   And they start going at it.  After a while I get tagged in, and we start, but she doesn't enjoy it, and asks for him again.    How many people put that kind of honesty in their blog?          C)   Well, I had a third, but it just floated away.  Fuck it.
