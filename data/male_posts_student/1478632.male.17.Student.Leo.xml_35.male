Today has sucked so far, and to top it all off, I have to go to work in an hour. Ugh. It's tuesday, so *hopefully* it won't be too busy at the Basket tonight. I stopped by last night after I dropped Laura off at her house and it wasn't too bad in there, and usually tuesday is a calm night becuase everyone is out of money (like me). Yarg. I don't have a whole lat I can do in an hour, so I'm just sitting here listening to Bassic's Daydreamer CD. He released it a little more than a year ago for free download off his website, so I got it. Then, he started charging for it and coincidentaly I had to reformat my hard drive soon after. So I backed up all my media to Seth's computer and He just burned me the CD again. *yay* Bassic is awesome. I love his EI song. A lot. Eh. Nothing else to write about at the moment. --Jake
