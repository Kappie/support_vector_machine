This time, I'll talk about my sleep talking, and then some other stuff that's just going to come out.   urlLink    Lauren and me. Lauren is my co-editor for the Student Life section (obviously, she's on the left). Don't expect her smile to stay all year though...we'll be down each others throats every day this year!  urlLink       urlLink    Me and Alex. Before Lauren and Alex started fighting at Universal (and I knew they would eventually), she took a pic of us.  urlLink          urlLink    The world famous Universal globe. Took this picture so that I would have something to do with my Photoshop class.  urlLink      urlLink    Lauren and Alex. At Universal, they took this picture...right before they started fighting.   urlLink      Now for a quick break before I start posting more pictures.  There's quite a few more that I'm going to post.  So, here's a couple stories from camp:    David the Sleeptalker:  Guess so.  Tuesday night at around 12:30 in the morning, the other guys (minus Adam who was asleep already) were talking about who was hot in their class.  Well, I had dozed off, and I woke up about an hour later muttering something about who was hot, and they all just kinda started staring at me, wondering what I was talking about.  Apparently, I was only muttering, and not saying any words (except for one, basically, and it was someone's name).  So, I don't know what happened, I had only done that a couple times before in the past, and it was a long time ago.  But, I wasn't the only one in Camp Orlando that did that.  Someone in my class had done it the same night that I had.  I guess it just happens to some people sometimes.    Aye, The Luck of the People Next to the Irish Dude:  I may have mentioned the whole security guard thing earlier, where the Irish Dude next door to us had kept complaining.  Here's the whole story.  Monday night, we were all bouncing around the beds (Jarrod and Jonny, is what I mean by "we"), and Mrs. Yearbook Advisor comes in to tell us that we have to be in our rooms.  The Irish dude next door came out and said that we were too loud (Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, specifically, which is just weird).  So, the next two nights progress, and then, last night, possibly when I was sitting there biting everyone's heads off for doing something bad, they called and complained again.  That's when the security guard came through.  Possibly, we should have complained about him, because we weren't  that  loud at all, and at 1:30 in the morning one night, he started slamming doors.  In fact, I thought we were pretty quiet for having 5 teenage guys in the same room.      I'll be back in a while with more pictures.  Until then, enjoy what you got.  See ya.
