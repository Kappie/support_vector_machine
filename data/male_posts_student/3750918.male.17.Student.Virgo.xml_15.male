I don't know if that's a good thing or not, I've never done something that ambitious, blog-wise.  Just as a primer for those new to blogging: Blog entries are for substance, for adding news items or proposals for protests and such, not for things like "kewl site, d00d" or "send me Half-Life CDKEY plz". Feel free to send me an e-mail if you want me to add a link or change the background or the font size or whatever.  I'll act as the administrator for the blog and kind of monitor posts and keep it real, etc. I hope to see and read some good things. That said, I'll leave you with a photo that I got a kick out of:      John Kerry at the shooting range
