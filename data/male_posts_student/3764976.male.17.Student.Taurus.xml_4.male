I watch the show because the host is fucking beautiful. Just had to say that. Actually, all of the female hosts on Fuse are beautiful. Fuck MTV, they don't play music videos anyway. Moving on, I've been listening to Matchbook Romance today and, flat out they have got to be one of the more talented bands in the post-hardcore genre. Their song, "Promise" is an amazing piece of music to listen to. I suggest that you all LEGALLY get the song one way or another. Indie acts rely on CD purchases and Live Shows to keep going, and as an indie band, they get a larger cut of all sales of their album. Listen to the song, get the CD, and enjoy the beauty that is Matchbook Romance. Um, been writing some music lately and trying to write every part as far as a song is concerned. I've got a couple so far and they aren't too bad. If anyone wants to hear them, let me know and maybe I'll give someone a copy of one of the songs. That's about it for now, later!
