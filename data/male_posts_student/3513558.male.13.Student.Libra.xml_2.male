Well, woke up latee and went to shop. AGAIN. wtf... nvm. ate Sushi for Lunch, walked around AEON for a while and bought CD player, Adidas shirt, sleeping bag (lolz) and a basketball. Quite "ouch"ful for Dad's pocket. lolzy  okiez, i shall tell my part, my secrets.  There is this girl, I met on the bus to Meitoku (Now stop thinking of finding her, she's in Japan). It was after school. Well, i sat in a cramped bus, yeouch. And then Nakajima introduced her to me as i was "strumming" my guitar. omFg. My first impression was: chio. A beauty she is. She is one year my junior. Perfect.  I wanted to ask her her name. Damn fuck Nakajima an irritating bastard come screwing up my conversation with her. well, that girl thinks i am alright. Waves to me when she sees me. I sort of... find her cute when i haven't had that feeling for years? lolz, but i muz say i give up lolz. coz i believe when she grows up, she will be in the celebrity circle. She has a pretty face and guess what? Golfer. Wtf. I think she will have countless boyfriends. DEH, better stop before i start to like her. Lolz  ah, well. Feel much better writing that  Thought of the day: 1 life, live it
