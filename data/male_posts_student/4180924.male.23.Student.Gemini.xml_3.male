I'd stop reading right now if I were you. Go watch  urlLink This Land is Your Land  (again). Check up on the  urlLink Braves  or  urlLink Dawgs . Get the latest  urlLink sports updates . Look at some fun  urlLink t-shirts . Go wash your car. Take a nap. Order some  urlLink CDs or some books . Have fun perusing the  urlLink pictures  on  urlLink my website . I'm telling you -- do anything to avoid reading this because I can tell right now that it isn't going to be very fun to read (now or ever). So stop. Turn off the computer and go to the gym.  Again, consider yourselves warned. I'm in rare depress-fest form tonight (sorry, morning now) and we all know how bad this can get.  I'm sitting in my room listening to stuff that isn't conducive to my mental well-being. I just got back from tha club. Well, not really, it was only Country Rock...and it was basically deserted...and it was a little bit lame, although we were the life of the party...but still -- it was fun. Well, unless we're talking about my emotional state.  The last two weeks have been rough...I'm not going to lie to you. Some of the roughest in recent memory, actually. And I don't know why. I just can't figure it out. If I could, well, I wouldn't be crazy. And we all know I am.  Honestly, the last ten or fourteen days have been a blur. They've all been essentially the same to me and the saying "same old shit, different day" doesn't even cover it. I haven't been able to sleep (which is why I'm sitting here writing this at 2am). I haven't been hungry, but I've eaten because one has to eat. I haven't been working out because I can't. The stupid moon boot prohibits that. It just ain't been pretty.  School started back this week, and my God is this semester going to be total hell. I have 8 books for one class, 6 for another, and 1 for the third. Books cost me $400 this afternoon. Graduate school, I am quickly learning, simply means that they continually pile work on you until you think you can’t take anymore. Then they give you a little more to make your life completely intolerable. Plus, football season begins in 2 weeks and I hope I can make it to some games. It’s going to suck, but such is the essence of my life.  And now, someone wants to start a relationship (albeit purely sexual), but that ain't happening anytime soon because she's married (in the initial stages of a divorce at the moment, which will certainly change soon, I'm sure). Since my parents managed to raise my crazy ass with some sense of morality, nothing is going to happen until both of their signatures are on the divorce papers. It’s not that I’m against casual sex (some of the morality didn’t stick very well), but sorry, but I'm just going to have sex with a married woman. Not gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent.  Cameron Diaz, Charlize Theron, and I are at the Country Rock tonight and it's karaoke night (names have been changed to protect the innocent). The host lady manages to talk us into singing a song (Sweet Home Alabama) and we weren’t that bad actually. Then I sing “You Never Even Call Me By My Name.” I don’t think I’m packing it up and moving to Nashville anytime soon, but I can hold my own on some karaoke. That song is a great karaoke song because everyone can get involved and have a good time. It’s a very interactive song. I drag my two companions up there with me to sing backup and some other folks crowd around us.  One of these people happens to be a pretty cute brunette who tells me bye and that I did a good job as I’m walking back to our table. Later, Charlize goes over to talk to her and brings her back to where Cameron  I are sitting. This is obviously a ploy to get me to talk to this unknown female, which (as we all know) RT sucks at doing. Charlize manages to get the two of us on the dance floor and I’m being myself – stuttering, searching for things to talk about, and just generally being the socially inept loser that I am when it comes to these things. As one might imagine, I didn’t have the courage to talk to this girl anymore, so that fell through.  This happens way more than I’d like to admit. I’d rather not talk to the girl again than to try to talk to her and be rejected. ‘Cause I absolutely cannot handle rejection. If I don’t go back over, then I won’t be rejected. I also won’t ever get a phone number, or a date, or anything like that…but at least I won’t have to suffer through the rejection.  All I can think right now is WTF? It hits me, as it often does, that I’m doomed to be alone. (It’s about to get real bad. You might want to go wash your hair or something now.) How in the hell am I ever going to find someone when I can’t even initiate a simple conversation, much less sustain the discussion for any length of time? The simple answer, albeit mighty disheartening, is that I won’t. It just isn’t going to happen. How the hell can it? How can I expect it to? To be perfectly honest with myself, I can’t.  But I still do. Some part of me still longs for the comfort of an actual relationship…some sort of companionship. And while part of me longs for that, another part just can’t take the possibility of rejection. That’s the part that wins out all of the time. And it’s killing me on the inside. And I don’t know how to fix it. Hell, I don’t even know if it can be fixed. This is the dichotomy that is eating at me right at this moment.  You might be thinking, “Why doesn’t this crazy ass just go to a shrink?” Believe me, I’ve been trying. Figuring out an insurance policy is about as easy as a blind man trying to decipher the Rosetta stone. Apparently, I have to call and ask permission to go to a shrink. Should that permission be granted, I then have to search out one who is in the PPO. It’s not only that, though, I have to find one who is actually accepting new patients. Plus, I’m limited to 20 visits per year. No, I’m sorry…my entire family is limited to 20 visits per year. WTF?  Insurance companies must hate me – I have surgery every year, I get sick at least twice a year, and I’m crazy. No wonder premiums are so damn high.  Okay, I'm done with this for now. Maybe I can sleep until 4 or 5 am tonight now...but I doubt it. The cable's out, too, which means that I'm just going to be lying in the dark watching the ceiling fan go 'round and 'round.  I love my life. Can't you tell? ;-)  Thanks for reading this emotional gibberish, although I told you not to. Oh, and I don't want pity - save that for someone who really needs it. I'll survive. It's what I do. I'll pick myself up, go to work tomorrow, meet my parents for dinner, and go watch my sister twirl the baton tomorrow night. Then, I'll go to Cherokee this weekend and watch some bluegrass. On Sunday, I'm going to a volunteer meeting for an  urlLink old professor who is running for political office . And come Monday, I'll hit the books and settle back into the role of the overachieving loser that I am. It's just what I do. While I do it all, everyone will think "He's just got everything so together" and other things of that nature which couldn't be further from the truth. It doesn't make life any easier, but it's how I operate. Always have, always will.
