This place is so desolate, and it is beginning to tear away on my soul.  I am tired of no trees and no elevation changes, too much sky makes it to easy to drift off and dream of a far off place where you can be the person you want to be.  I feel like I have all this responsibility and nothing to show for it, but time and patience will take care of that.  I wish I could utter the words, I am tired of life here, lets take a holiday in Spain.  I have had a hard time nudging Maria out of my brain.  She has such a personal side to her, willing to display her vulnerability to anyone with no reservation.  I wish I could let people know the real me, the one has his feelings hurt when friends let me down.  I wish people knew how much I genuinely care for them, but some things are better said through actions.  I don't believe she shares the same feelings as I have for her.  She has so many boys knocking down her door, I may have personality but that can only carry you so far.  Enough of this  There was a baby at the hospital today that weighed only two pounds and was carried for 9 months.  She was just tiny, but I looked as her eyes struggled to open from time to time.  I am reminded of what really makes everyday life beautiful.  Not materials, not where you live, or if you are doing great in life.  It is the common bond we all share, we are human beings that exist to help others to accomplish life. We all exist to give a ride in a bus, check out your groceries, pick up the trash, nurse back to health, Whatever the case may be, my rambling has no point other than I love to see people live their lives.   Damn the man, save the empire
