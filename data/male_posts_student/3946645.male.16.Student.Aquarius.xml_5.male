My exams are over so I can play games now and I'm also working on my site,  urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk    It's not finished yet, in fact I've hardly started it! If you are a web  master/designer then bookmark it for when it's done, it will have  resources and tutorials for you people like you! Also I might need help  with it, I mean I need people to submit some tutorials/resources as  well, as I can't manage the whole thing.   I am doing some tutorials as well however, and don't worry, I'll be a  professional. I'm studying a course to get the qualification "Master  CIW (Certified Internet Webmaster) Designer/Developer". I haven't  started the course yet, but I still know some stuff. I guess I'll be  starting it in about a week or two. However, I do know some stuff about  web design. I'll put what I learn on the Dark Rose site and share it  with the world!   Also visit  urlLink http://www.thewastelands.2ya.com .  It's my mates forums and it's full of nonsense!! But it's good  nonsense, please register and post, it needs more people like you!    Please feel free to add me to your MSN:  urlLink mrkill47@hotmail.com  I need to talk to people!    What else do I want... n00b serveres for Battlefield 1942 and Desert Combat. I bought it while I had exams and didn't get a good chance to play them properly, now I wanna learn em :P Post a comment on some n00b servers or something or e-mail/contact me on MSN.    Right, that's all for now, I'm thinkin of adding some abckground music to it, you know, for that more personal feel... But it will probably depend on the mood that I'm in.
