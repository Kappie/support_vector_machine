My computer seems to have been over taken with spyware, the ones i really like are the ones that open the CD tray for you, i mean how convenient, i always find some way to benefit from it, so ive been watching alot of DVD's lately on my comp...man, i sure am lazy.  Today we had a TKD tourney today and i didnt do half ass bad, it was my first and i didnt have any gear...soooo.  Lets just say things didnt go completely smooth, i used a friends gear and got Second in Form.  I then got my ass handed to me by Sam Wilson's sibling Shayne, Blue belt (im green, he is a rank higher) in my first match of sparing...im glad he won the division though, better than that girl who everone cheated for...but its all good, i got two trophies so im happy.  kaz ma I, it really does...shit nigga, it dont matter.
