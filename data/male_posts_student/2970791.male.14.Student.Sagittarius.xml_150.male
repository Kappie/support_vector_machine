Because I revealed the evil (not to say hilarious) prankster, we should not have the chatterbox post/blog post rule.  If that rule stays in effect, I will have to flood the blog again, and remember how irritating that got?  I wil also flood the chatterbox just to get rid of the great prank messages.
