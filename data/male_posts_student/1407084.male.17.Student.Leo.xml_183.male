Leigh you should give me your schedule so I can plan a saturday off. gimme a call, or something.   by the way, for all you people reading this blog, I want you to know that i hate each and every one of you equally. thank you. bye now.  Well, good luck building trebuchets, lifeguarding, dreaming, twirling your hair, guitaring, movie recording, eating, exercising, dancing, movieing, girl scouting, horseback riding, flirting with people, ice creaming, or whatever you happen to be doing. I'll be thinking of you while I watch tv for the remainder of my summer.
