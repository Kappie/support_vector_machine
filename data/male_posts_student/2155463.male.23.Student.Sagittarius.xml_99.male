For some reason people around here, when in large groups of cars, feel an urgent need to slow down to 5-10 BELOW the speed limit, thus meaning that those behind them have to slow down even further! I mean, there is absolutely NO reason (accidents and whatnot aside) why traffic should ever come to a standstill on a major highway! And perhaps the worst thing is that it's not usually one of those gradual slow-downs where you have time to see everyone stopping and ease into it. NO, around here everyone has to brake at the LAST second, meaning that I have to do likewise (which is a little bit trickier with my manual transmission, especially if I want to get going again quickly).  But the thing that is getting on my nerves MOST about Cleveland driving (although it's something I'm getting used to) is the way that all the major highways up around Cleveland seem to drive absolutely backward. I mean, most of the time the SLOW people are in the far-right hand lane and the FAST people (like me) are in the far-left hand lane. Nope, not around here. In fact, the right-hand lane is often the SLOWEST lane, whereas the left-hand lane is actually moving along the quickest. Now this is usually due to the fact that the left-hand lane turns into an exit somewhere down the road, necessitating a frantic merge back into the "middle" lane, but it's definitely NOT the way I was taught to drive!  Anyway, aside from all this complaining, I think that I found an awesome drive on my way back from work. Normally I take 77-480-271-8 on the way back, but the last couple of days I've been taking 77-271 and then a bunch of back roads. The back roads go through the Valley, so all the curves and hills are a lot of fun (personal rule: take curves 15-20 mph faster than the "recommended" speed ;). And the best part is that it only takes me about 5-10 minutes longer than the "usual" way (assuming that traffic on 77 isn't too bad).
