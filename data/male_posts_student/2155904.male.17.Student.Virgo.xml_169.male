It was so pleasant to bask out in the sun and even be able to just go out and play in it after school.  Tyke finished off a little math test 1st period and the sub in there is a royal bitch.  She is so annoying it really pisses off Tyke.  She sat on the heater right next to Tyke's table which made him think that she was just waiting to catch them for cheating.  Sure they were cheating but she shouldn't have known that.  Anyway, Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil all tried to get the class out of 4th period early with the usual bag ruffling antics but stupid Dyke-Bitch went crazy and got way too caught up in the stupid movie they were watching.  So they only got out of class 3 minutes early.  It was gay.  And really annoying.  It actually made Tyke mad at her.  Very mad.  Lunch at Subway was ever so tasty and the rest of the day just breezed by.  After school Tyke rushed home to change out of his clothes.  He had worn the awesome pink shirt he bought if you didn't get to see him.  Let's just say that it seems the shirt is a hit.  That shirt is so hott.  If he had 10 cents for every time someone said they either liked the shirt or that they liked pink on Tyke he would have accrued more than a dollar in wealth.  He might have had like a buck fifty.  That is the new favorite shirt of Tyke's even more than his Habitat for Humanity shirt which he might wear tomorrow if it is nice like it is supposed to be.  Not as nice as today but still pretty nice.  So he might bust that baby out as he hasn't worn it for quite some time.  Back to after school...Tyke went to Tibbetts with Skippy, Big and Little Twigg, Naan, Amed, and Piggy J on the supposition that they were going to play kickball.  Well nobody had a real kickball so they decided to just take stuff out of Tyke's car and use that.  They took out a soccer ball, baseball bat and tennis ball, and a frisbee.  It was pretty fun for a while and Tyke and Piggy J were gonna toss the friz a little more at the end but Tyke decided he would go home and eat cuz he was hungry even though he got a Jamba on the way to the park.  But it was fun, so there.  Last night Tyke was talking with himself in his mind and he made some decisions about life.  He really would like to not have any of the romantic feelings he has right now.  If it is so easy to be hit with these feelings, it should be just as easy to get rid of them.  Especially if it is unrequited.  Tyke isn't saying he doesn't ever want to be romantically involved as you know, he just wants to be able to control his feelings better.  Cuz he certainly isn't making anything better.  So that is this little addition to Tyke's Troubled Thoughts.  Something that would make his life much easier to handle.  Not like it's hard by any means.  Just frustrating.  Tyke might go to the baseball game tomorrow.  Not for sure, but he might.
