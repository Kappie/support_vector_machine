       
      Welcome to my new blog: Best Uses for Broadband.  Here I will post all the cool sites where broadband is required, or enhances the experience. I am dying to see them in their full, and will probably go though this list once I get broadband.  If you already have broadband and would just like some extra sites to surf to, don't hesitate to take a look at the links on this website. There should be some really interesting ones, and it would be quite kind of you if you would comment on the particular link in question.
