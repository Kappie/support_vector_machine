After school I did my routine physio treatment.  This consists of 10 minutes on and eliptocal and 10 minutes on a stair climber.  Sure, sounds easy to you people, but don't be physically active for a year and spend two weeks of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and get some of that good ol' muscle atrophy.  So, for me, it is pretty tough.  It is getting easier so that is a plus.  I was then awaited by Laura and Kendra sitting in my van.  I usually go straight home and do a work-out.  But instead, we sat around and talked for a good length of time then they wanted to play with Bowflex, so we did.    This afternoon I had received my windscreen for my bike.  So after dinner, I installed that for about 10 minutes.  Scott came and gave a hand.     urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 1   urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 2   urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 3  We then went to his house and played some X-box Live for an hour or so.  THEN, we took the Yuskalade (Yukon/Escalade) for a drive.  She's perdy I tell yeah... I mean, who in Shaunavon has '20's on their feets'? Please!  We went to his shop to look at his bike parts.  They are primed and need one more sanding session and are ready for powdercoating.  I can't wait for his bike to be ready!  It is said to be ready by the middle to the end of June.  Which works out great for me because it is when about I will start riding.  So this way I am not tempted to force my knee.  We also looked at the Yamaha R6 at his shop.  Spiffy!  But no SV... :D  He then dropped me off at home.   The day was good... It is pretty late and I still have to e-mail Laura so I will leave today's post with this in your head... How can I get better sleeping patterns?  Post them in comments! Thanks,
