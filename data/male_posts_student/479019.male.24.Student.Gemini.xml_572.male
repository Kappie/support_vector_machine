I've literally only been... eating, sleeping surfing the web, and drinking.  Last night was cool. Derek, Jon, Heather, and I went to Shooters for the free food. It wasn't bad considering it was free. Wings, fries, nuggets, chips, taquitos, salads, etc. What was really interesting was the biker meeting that was going on in there. We were a bit confused by all the Harleys that were parked out side and the dude playing with the mic. At least I can say I've been to a biker meeting now. Afterwards, we watched some TV at my place. We caught the second episode of  The OC . Alas I have no TV at school... I can't watch it there... but would it make me homesick?  I've been listening to the  Circle Jerks  as of late. I'm looking forward to seeing them in a few weeks.  I think I'll go shower, make myself some breakfast, do some writing, and at some point go to UCI to return a book or 2.  ***
