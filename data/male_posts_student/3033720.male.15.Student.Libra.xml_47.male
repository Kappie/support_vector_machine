I really wish there were some people out there to do stuff with, but hey, make the most of what you've got. The reason I haven't been posting lately is that I have been grounded do to unforseen circumstances. If this has caused any inconvienience, make me aware, and I will contact our manager promptly. As for the comments on the last post....I know one of the anonymous ones was Aleisa, as she hates my personality, though I'm not sure if she hates me. As for the others, well......I'm guessing one is Justin, and the other is Ponder...Though I thought he was more timid with such matters. Let me know if I was right, because if not I think I have someone visiting my blog that I really need to restrict. If you don't let me know who you are, I'm going to have to turn off anonymous comments, and if that doesn't work, comments altogether. Sorry, but once again, I think one of those people may be someone I really don't want on my site. With that note, I'm out.
