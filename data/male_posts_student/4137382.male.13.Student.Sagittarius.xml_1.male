The first part of every number is  his.  the part that is correctis mine.  read on   he claimed that this entire thing was filled with facts.  What a liar. a ling ling liar.   1.) Pikman is not easier to spell. In fact, when I ran pikman through my computer spell checker it said wrong, but no results were able to come up. Half Life is much easier to spell. Not that it really matters. Spelling usually doesn't affect gameplay.   2.) Wait, let me get this right. You must have innovatio. But when people go out of their way and take YEARS to make a new engine that will innovate it is bad? And yes, the gameplay is good. I had the privalege of playing the leek "demo" of HL2 and it was awesome.  3.) What?!!? I like all consoles equally with a little lean towards the xBox. Up until now I had not heard of Pikman 2. Not that you will listen but you can't say that it will sell better. you could say that you think it will sell better. But that is not a fact until both have been released. So that fact is more like crap.  4.) Bugs, powerful machine. Have you ever played a PC game? Some have bugs. Most have a few. However, I have never had to call tech support to figure out how to run a game. Even when I am modding I can figure it out. And I am running a Mac. You know how much effort they put into mac games. Not as much as the smae company would put into the same game for PC. That means less support, less patches and so on. BtW: PC games sell better than GC games. Nice factoid.  5.) Except for the fact that Hlo did innovate, and they are nothing the same you are correct. Halo innovated. Only allowing you to carry two weapons. Vehicles. Awesome graphics. That is what innovation is. Retard. And the only thing that is similar in the two is that you have guns and you shoot. Because, see, it is a first person SHOOTER. SHOOTER. YOU SHOOT. THAT IS THE IDEA. Saying that the games are the same is like calling Super Mario World the same as Castlevania. They are both sidescrolers so they are the same. LOL...LOL...  6.) Yes, half life 1 story was a little dull. However, hl2 does have story. at least I think it does. See it isn't out yet. So it better not have cutscenes, or dialogue, or any single player at all. Otherwise your "fact" is wrong. BTW: Half life came out before MP was even drempt up. That means that MP must be copying HL. You retarded monkey tail.  7.) It doesn't have zombies. Who cares about playing a game that doesn't have zombies. So, don't play MP or Mario, or zelda, or MK:DD. They don't have zombies. So they must suck too. You are a fucken retard. Just because you have some wierd fetish with zombies does not mean that a game needs zombies to be good. Also, you havent played it so maybe it does have zombies. Loser  8.) Tru, the HL2 did not look as good as Halo 2, but uhhm. See the pic from RE4 was a cutscene. Not actual gameplay. It was prerenered. The gamecube can't handle as good of graphics as the computer or the box so stop trying. You want a good looking game? Try Syberia. That is and old xBox game that oustrips the new GC games by a mile.  9.) WTF? No goombas. I refer you to the bit about zombies. Screw MP. screw Geist. screw all that. Everygame must have zombies and goombas and not have people in space suits, not use menus to start and must not use the same letters in their title. Also they must have fake innovation. Stop shooting yourself in the foot. It took me 3 hours to get good at haol pc. You have to spend a little time getting good at a game. otherswise it is boring because it is too easy. And it took me 15 minutes to install all of the sims gaes on my computers. And about 20 to install halo. After that, they ran easy as the cubes games. Ohh but wait. The option is their to mod the PC games. that makes them much more fun. Sure, you have to do a little work to get it modded corectely. But after that you have it home free. And it is much more awesome.  10.) Who cares about a "Seal of quality" You are just proving that you are fan boys. God damnit. Take your head out of the cube and play some other games with an open mind. you are not hardcore gamers. Hardcore gamers play lots and lots of games. You are loser gamers. you play only Nintendo games. get a life.  In other words, don't buy pikman 2, let Gabe newall live his own lifestyle, that is none of your business. And, buy a game that is much cooler than GCs crap. Halo 2.  specialest I think you have fact and fiction mixed up. I was able to prove all of your "facts" wrong. Go play some of the games you are dissing. Play them with an open mind. Pretend that you are play the GC port of them if you must. And than go get some counsiling.
