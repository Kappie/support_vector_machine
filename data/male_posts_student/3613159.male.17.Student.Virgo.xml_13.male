I saw coffee and cigarettes (by myself) and enjoyed most of the film. Highlights definitely being "Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil" and the one with Rza, Gza and Bill Murray. The theatre began shaking about half way into the picture and I first assumed the bass was extremely good but soon realized that it was an earthquake. So strange how the earth rebels beneath us and we can do nothing to stop it.
