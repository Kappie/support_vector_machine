Ironically, i had said i was never going to be interested in doing a blog as i was not that sort of "person".. Well i guess i did not even realise what that sort of "person" was when i said those words out aloud..    Why the sudden interest in blogging? Sleepless nights + Nobody to talk to (besides God) + lack of stuff to do = blogging... But more importantly, i felt i needed somewhere or something where i could express myself freely.. free of being criticized at the instantenous action of making a stupid remark or a careless slip of my tactless tongue...      I was once asked a question, if you could change anything in your life, what would it be... At that point of time i had not thought the question through carefully and just spurted out a simple answer of "Nothing." I felt the lack of need to change anything that has happened in my life as anything different would not have made me the person i am today.. Thinking back on that question, if i were to be asked the same thing, i would answer the same way i guess... I would like to use this chance to say a big SORRY to anybody and everybody whom i have upset in any way or any manner.. be it a small let down to a big disappointment.. I want to say SORRY for being an insensitive jerk and for being the sorry person that i am.. There is only so much i can express verbally and through my words but i can only learn with each passing mistake and look up to those in heaven and pray as i smile on this earth still today..      Once more, sorry whoever you are, whereever you are.. Sorry for me being me...      "Time whiles by, as i sit here today.    Dreams of you, offer nought but comfort to my mind.    Thoughts going wild, people telling lies.    When will we learn to abandon this foolish masquerade, to drop our disguise..."
