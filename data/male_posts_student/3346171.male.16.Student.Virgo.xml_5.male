In afternoon i watched a program about wrestlings, incredible what people do for living, 2 guys punching and kickin' each other like animals. And another program about Jacko, poor guy, but he's done lots of wrong things on his life, and the main ones are the cirurgy plastics he's done on his face, he wasn't that ugly, and the way he found to explaim the color change is so not believable.  When i sat on the pc chair my brother's says that he's going to the movies, and i say that i'm going with him, i don't know what happenned to my dad but he open his wallet in the first time a asked him some money. Getting in the movies, my brother says that he's not going to watch anymovie ANYMORE, that's fine, better be alone than with an annoyig one by your side, so i bought my ticket and we took a walk through the mall - we walked for about  one hour and a half- then he left and watched a fashion thing - thing means: those girls and boys waking with clothes that someone made for them, i don't know this word, HAuHAuHAuHAu, could some one teach me?!!!! - very nice, and little bit funny, there was this model walking like a gazel, jumping, i have this friend, she is a model too, and she doesn't walk that way.  Before my brother left he bought me a candy, named Fruitella, very good, Good lord my stomach by now is a bomb, I ate LOOOOOTS of that. And i went to the movies with my candies on my pockets, sucking each by each.  I watched "Troy", nice movie , but it's clear who's going to win the end, so i lost the insantivation to watch, but everything else is really nice!
