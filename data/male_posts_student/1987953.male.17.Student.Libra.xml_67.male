I have been doing a lot of work reorganizing my room, hopefully for good, including putting everything pertaining to Brittany into a big box for storage, thank God, listening to  Stay Gone  by Jimmy Wayne, one of my favorite Country artists. The song is identical to the story of Brittany and I told by my point of view. The lyrics are at the bottom. READ THEM!   I found out on Monday that there is no way my parents will let me go to prom in New Jersey. For those of you who did not know, I was trying to have my parents let me go to Jessica Aubry's prom in New Jersey. Jess is a good friend I met at camp when I met Kari, but Jess and I are not as close as Kari and I are. She asked me in early March if I could take her to her prom. I want to go to see her so bad, and would love to go to prom with her seeing that it doesn't feel right going to my prom at my new school since I know nobody but like 10-20 seniors and lots of sophomores. But yeah, my parents think it's irresponsible of them to let me go somewhere they have never been with people they barely know, so whatever. Jess knows that since I will be 18 in October if she wants to take me to her senior prom I'm there like swimwear. Well, I guess swimwear won't really be there, will it?  Anyway, I have to go soon. I have to call Jessica at 2:00 and go to work at 4:00. Thanks to all of the people who read this thing and are patient when I don't blog for a week. I am jealous of your prayers. Blog ya later!
