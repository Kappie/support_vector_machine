On that note, I guess I can move on....      My eyes are dry... maybe it's because my fan is on... but I don't wanna turn it off because then I'll get hot. So yeah today... I watched TV, listened to music... same ol' same ol'... yeah then me and my sister watched Jeepers Creepers which is really good, and then we played the boardgame Goosebumps: Terror in the Graveyard. It is quite possibly the best boardgame ever invented. Then.... David stopped by and let me borrow some CDs... The Killers, My Chemical Romance, Motion City Soundtrack, and Dashboard Confessionals, so that is really cool. I went to Andy's house tonight with a group of people. We watched Forest Gump. It was kinda for this guy that was in town visiting Codi, cuz she met him on a cruise. I think he thinks I'm weird, because when I first walked in the door I saw him and I was like "heeeeeeey!" and then he was just like  "hey"   so I derno, haha. Yep.. so I left his house around 10:30 and came home, thanks for the ride Saba. Now I'm home listening to all of my new music... I still miss Claire... haha I'm pitiful.... hahaha. I want her to get back so I can show off all of my new social skills to her, hahaha. Well that's it for now. PEACE OUT BRIZZONE... CALZONE! those things are crazy good
