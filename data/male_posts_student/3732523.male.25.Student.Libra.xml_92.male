I shoot the... er... crap with my sister rather frequently, because we're both on MSN messanger.  So I see her... usually once a week or so.  And every time I catch up on the gossip, there's always something new to report.    My sister was the third child in our family.  So I wonder if it's just an extreme case of the Pay Attention To Meeeee's or just some sort of bizzare, unidentified personality disorder. :)  The former, you would have think would have worn off by now... she's in her early 20s.  The teenage angst should be over with.   Anyhow, this all began when my sister decided she wanted to be an adult entertainer.  Since she's... um... extremely overendowed, and she says she wasn't into any of the darker aspects of the trade, supposedly this consisted mostly of dressing up as a cheerleader and jumping up and down.  Pretty harmless stuff I guess, and it pays the bills for a while.  Not too bad, I suppose, but not something you expect to be doing for very long.  Well, it's true it didn't last for very long, because she's got an attention span for careers that lasts about 3 days.  :)  Sandra decided to go into business with a friend doing "erotic" massage as a masseusse by the name of Satin Touch.  Again, this was supposedly fairly innocent as far as the sex trades go, and went sour when Sandra's friend decided she wanted to add some female escort stuff on the side.  So she was out on her own again.  I think the whole family was expecting her to grow out of the phase and go back to real work.  But that would have been too normal for Sandra :)  Sandra decided she didn't like getting naked for people, so instead she moved sideways in the trade.  She decided to move into the realm of S  Translation: she decided to try her hand at beating the crap out of men (and the occasional woman) for a living.  Now, granted, this sounds like every woman's dream job, especially when she's on the rebound :)  But rarely do people actually make the career choice ;)  She went all out, black leather and whips and stuff.  And she started joining the cast of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I'm having difficulty confirming what started first, her penchant for dressing as a man dressed as a woman in scary dominatrix outfits, or her work as a dominatrix.  I have a suspicion that the two are linked somehow :D    Speaking of which, here's a picture of her as Frank:  urlLink      urlLink http://denverrhps.com/ is also the site for the whole Denver RHPS scene.  Just for you, Steph :)  Near neighbors, geographically speaking.  Anyhoo, I thought this was about as bizzare as it could possibly get when Sandra recently announced another career change.  Sandra, possibly still suffering some post-traumatic teenage angst syndrome, had decided to run away and join the circus.  Well, I suppose it wasn't really running away, as they seem to be some sort of local group.  But yes, my dear sister has become, by her own volition, a carnival freak.  To be more precise, she decided to start a strong-man act where she lifts heavy objects with her boobs.  Like telephone books.  And somehow I had more difficulty convincing people that she had actually decided to do this than I did getting people to believe she was a dominatrix.  Go figure.  But now, ladies and gentleman, I have photographic evidence!  The naughty bits are not visible so I hope Steph doesn't get mad at me for this.  But really this was too priceless not to share.    I present to you: The Amazing Boobzilla!  urlLink     And yes, that really IS her carny name.  To boot, today I discover that she's decided to shack up with a fire-eater who goes by the unimaginitive name of "Crispy."  She says this whole group is his gig.  I guess he finds the idea of her lifting telephone books with her tits is really seductive or something.    Oddly enough, not too long ago (actually I think it was last week's news), for some reason my sister decided also to become an ordained minister.  I have no idea why.   But you know what?  Getting yourself married by the Amazing Boobzilla would definitely rate as an incredible thing.  I think it must actually edge out getting married by Elvis.  And you could hire on Crispy to spew some flaming vodka instead of doing that boring traditional crap like blowing bubbles or throwing rice.  I wonder if she performs the vow ceremony with telephone books under each tit.  That'd definitely present you with some unorthodox wedding photos. :D    Takers?  Anyone?
