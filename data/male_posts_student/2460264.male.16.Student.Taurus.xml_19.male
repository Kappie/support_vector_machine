There was only one problem, this girl... she left early and I didn't like it. Anyways, other than that it was cool. Tomorrow will be another boring day. I think I'm leading worship for the thing tomorrow at the Hutton's. Yikes, I dunno what I'm gunna do. I'm not good at that kinda thing, leading, and I dunno. I'm going to try and get Evan to help me and play with me or something. Otherwise, I dunno if I'll do it. I was watching a bunch of bands music videos and I found the best one. It's the music video for "best of me" by The Starting Line. It's really funny.       Tonight, my life doesn't go much deeper than that.       Goodnight      ~Timmy
