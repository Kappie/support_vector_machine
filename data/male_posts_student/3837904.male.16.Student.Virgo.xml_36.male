It was a hard knock as I seem to not be well added that burdon. Jieren was so retard with the stick. Not even taking the initiative to whack the ball once. Claiming that he don't wanna get himself all wet. Mother tongue seems to be kinda chaotic from other lessons. We seem to mock around more today. Pouring water on suman's file and emptying the hole-puncher in his pocket. And not to mention being the main culprit of damaging his file.
