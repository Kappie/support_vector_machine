I took out a large scissors from my bag and asked my friend next to me to kill me. She thought i was joking. I snatched the scissors from here and started to rub the sharp end on to my right arm. The girls around me went, "Den! stop it Den. Den you are a good friend. Please ah Den stop it ok." Syakilla turned around and asked what was wrong but instead tears started to fill my eyes. The girls that sat around me saw me crying. After that was M.T. (malay) no teacher entered the class so what i did was borrowed a Pen Knife from Syazwanie and took a packet of tissue from Azimah.   I sat at the back of the class and started to cut my self but i couldn't because my skin is very thick. Seri saw me cutting my self. She stopped me and asked me what was wrong. Then i started crying. Many crowded over me, i shouted and asked them to leave me alone so they did. I took out my wallet and looked at His picture. I felt like tearing the picture but i couldn't because  I STILL DO LOVE HIM . I cried alot in class. After that was Recess. I walked quickly to the canteen and ate a few breads and bought a bottle of mineral water and biscuits.    Left the crowded place and went to the Science corner which is a very deserted and dark. I started to eat my food. Once done i took out the pen knife which was in my pocket and slashed my left arm. It was quiet difficult as i have thick and elastic skin. Instead i slowly pierce my skin and scared it. Its just small slashes, two only. so don't worry k.  I got out of control, i couldn't stop crying, couldn't stop hating my self for what i have done to him.  Luckily Syakilla heard a silent cry and walked towards the corner. She saw me trying really hard to cut my self but lukily i already had, twice. She snatched the pen-knife away from me and throw it away. She asked me what was wrong but all i did was just kept quiet.   When got back to class i had stopped crying because it was Food And Nutrition lesson. At least cooking had made me feel better. My teacher, Ms Mayer Chan, had taken photos of me and my partner cooking and took a photo of my dish. She said that i have very good set ups and good in garnishing food. She was really nice to me. After cooking we had to do Evaluation, its when you write a small essay about how, what does the dish taste like, smells, looks and what imporvements can be made just like a critic. My teacher loves my Evaluation because i always evaluate in detail, Like Duh... she said i am the IRON CHEF of the school. haha.   After three periods of Food And Nutrition it was Biology, my favorite lesson. Little cheerful because i am her favorite student in the class hahaha. I always ask questions, get distinction during exams, complete my work, very smart... and so on... she sure mentioned about me alot inthe student report. Everyone in the class was making alot of noise. She was teaching about ourred blood cells. Like i too did not pay attention as i have read about the chapter way long before the lesson started. Instead when she mentioned about Virus i started to ask alot of questions.. like Why? What? How?... lots of time... every answer she gave me i would continue on for example, "Our body must be fit to stay healthy." and i would ask, "Why?", "because so that the system in our body can function properly."... and i would ask why, what and how a lot of times. Causing everyone to keep quiet and listen to me go on and on with my questions. Many started to giggle as i ask her questions.   The final bell of the day rang. Everyone was happy but i wasn't because i had to stay back to practice the final time for the Indian Dance Competition, which will be tml. After an hour of practice i sat one corner of the room. All of the sudden i started to think of HIM and began to cry. The gang crowded around me. I stood up and went to the toilet. Three guys from the gang came out a few seconds after i had left the room. Washed my face. I was drying my hand (note the dryer is really near to thedoor)when i realised that my shoe was untied so i bent down slowly,  suddenly the door swung open with a powerful force. The handle of the door hit my head really hard, then with the door handle like a pressing motion... it caused my head to hit the hand dryer. It all happened really fast. My friend, Uwise..from one of the three guys who came out from the room after i left,came in and saw me like going to faint and in pain, he quickly grabbed me and let me rest on his body for a while. The two other guys, Syariff and Ismail was like beside him asking if i was alright and laughing. Uwise apologised, i couldn't hear anything much because my ear was also affected from the incident. I went out of the toilet dizzy and could faint anytime, i tried to hold my self together.  Walked to the room like a drunk man, sat at the table and rested there. Many asked me what was wrong but i kept quiet as i was too dizzy to talk. All of the sudden everything went black out when i rested on the table. Seri woke me up by shaking me vigerously. They asked me to go home to rest but i didn't i requested to practice one last time with costumes. My costume is very simple. A singlet as a top, a track pants and two scarfs, one worn around me the other tied around my waist. Once done with the practice, i went home.   Well thats all for now. Till next time k. Bubbye.
