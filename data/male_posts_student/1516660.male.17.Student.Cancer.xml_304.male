Oh yes, before I talk about today, I wanna share my views with yesterday's Survivor. Rudy was voted off (I thought Ethan). Poor thing. Everyone were stuck with a choice (not Rupert, he didn't vote off his ally). Either Rudy goes, or Ethan goes. Rudy, even though he was liked by everyone, was weak and frail, setting the team back in challenges. Ethan, even though everyone wanted him to get out because he won before, is strong and useful in challenges. I guess the team's survival is more crucial at this point of time. Oh well....a pity.  It's a brand new Saturday! So meowingly meowful. Okay...got up at the same time, and this time, I only bathed for 30 minutes. Tomorrow too. I gotta rush to watch Digimon. Meow moo. After some online surfing, I went to watch TV and eat breakfast (chee cheong fun).   At 11, I came online again. I chatted with XC, WQ (for a brief period of time), then ate lunch. After that, I went to play my PT. I played that until 4, then continued surfing till time to bath (6).  After bathing, it was eating dinner while watching TV. Heh Heh. After the Simpsons, I came back just in time to listen to Rick Dees' Number 1 song. It's Hey Ya by Outkast (for 8 weeks). "Hey ya....hey ya....hey ya!"  Well, today seems kinda boring. Wendy reminded me that I owed her $13.50 for the Internet service. Oh well. I wonder how I am going to pay her back, when I don't have moolah right now (I am not going to school, Mother stopped giving me my allowances. Damn...). Meow! Find a way!! Yes, WQ owes me money. YES YES! KS owes me money! I have enough (plus some ltitle bit from me) to repay Wendy le. Meow!!!  Hmm... I gotta go le la. What an early blog, you say. Oh well. How meowful! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
