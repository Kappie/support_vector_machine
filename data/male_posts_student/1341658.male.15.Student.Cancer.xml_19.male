And then a little bit was because a lot of the movie was a lot different from the book.   Like in the book, Crookshanks oddly led them into the shrieking shack by way of the willow. The cat knows how to push on a certain part of the tree to make it let them through. Also it is involved in the scene that follows.   In the movie, The have to fight there way into the passage. And Lupin is seen later using his wand to enter the tree.   This leads me to believe that speculation that Crookshanks is an animagi is false because JK wouldn't leave an important detail like crookshanks having intelligence out of the movie if the cat would later turn out to be a person. (That is if JK has as much influence on the movies as I thought)   Or maybe it would have just taken too much screentime. Or maybe means nothing at all. Or maybe no one will read this.   Also Sirius entered the Griffindor House twice in the book. hmm...   Everything in the 3rd movie was more dark silver and less gold. Makes the gold parts seem even better I suppose. But, this director won't be back so we will just have to see what color it is next time.   Also, the firebird was sent by Black long before in the book.   I'm sure there are many more differences, but I don't want to take the time to think of any more.   Will movie4 have the same actors? yes...
