I've started watching TV again, which is bad because I already don't have enough time to do all the ~useful~ things I'm supposed to do.  Specifially, I watch reruns of  Angel  that my friend Dave downloads off the web.  Yeah: 2 years of watching almost no television, might as well go straight to the WB.   We start around midnight every night, and go till about sunrise.  It's been 4 days, and we're about halfway through season 2.  Every morning when I trundle into the office feeling like a thousand pounds of tired, I declare that the night before was the last night I'm doing this, and then Dave says something about how Darla is going to come back pregnant with Angel's baby, and then I have to watch more. Also, lots of the characters often wear cool knitted stuff and that gives me ideas for what I want to make.   The other reason I keep coming back is because it means 4 hours of huddling on the couch with my pal Boober, on whom I have a crush.    Finish my thesis?  Never!
