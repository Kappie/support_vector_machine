Trying to do my history project but a little something called ADD compels me to press every single favorite on my list, scan through all my emails i have ever gotten, click every popup ad i see, and search for random things on google. And its raining and damp out so i cant do anything there (not like i would). ugh, i cant believe mr. waite gave us a prject due one week before schools out...jeez, he like hates us. i guess ill just watch some monty python for the rest of the day and pu off the project till...uhhh, yahhhh ;)
