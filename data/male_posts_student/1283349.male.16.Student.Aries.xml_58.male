Anyways, I won't make any promises this time. One, two, possibly thirty posts a month, that's all you're going to get.  Here's the skinny: Finals are just two weeks away, and I'm stressing on some deep internal level that I can't access right now. Good? I hope so.  I'm going nuts with T'kal Zahara, the latest in a long line of my pure-bred D badasses. I'm reading tons of Forgotten Realms books (8 so far) for some extra experience points, writing a short-story-esque history for him, creating a stronghold and detailing it better than most small press companies would detail a product, creating cohorts and baddies for him, hell, even writing canon for his god. I'm over the top, I know. But damn am I having a blast with it. It certainly gives a good way to vent all of my destructive tendencies, through this treacherous little backstabber (6d6 damage worth of backstabbing, by golly!)  I'm stalling out in Imperian. I don't know what the problem is, I'm just not very enthusiastic about it today.  Brian got a new job as a teacher, so that's nice, he'll be starving shortly I'm sure, with a salary like that. Well, that's not true. He'll be in jail, after he eats all the kiddos.  Abrupt, Caleb  Thought I was done, didn't you? Not so. Just wanted to say: don't freak out, but I changed the template. Okay, freak out if you want. But I'll be tinkering with it for a while, to see what all it can do.
