So I was talking to my mother about being a woman at MIT in 1976-80. She said that the male to female ratio was about 10:1. She had many classes where she was the only woman. I asked if she got a lot of sexism in any way because of this, but apparently she only got nerdy freaks hitting on her everywhere she went. She actually liked it, because there were these 500 or so women, who were not very popular at their high schools, and now they were the center of attention. Apparently the most uncomfortable part was sitting in those classrooms where she was the only woman and knowing that every guy in that room was looking and fixating on her. But that was what my father was there for.  My PS2 is 100% brokenified. I'm renting one today from Blockbuster so I can at least play my new game.  Weekends are not long enough. But when you think about it, the length never makes a difference, it always feels the same when it's over. I wish I were Japanese though. It must be really exciting knowing that starting next year they're getting a whole 2-day weekend, EVERY WEEK! Think about how wonderful it would be if your weekend was expanded for the rest of your academic career. Let's just ignore the fact that it's being upgraded to match ours.  Speaking of which, how much would it suck to have 1-day weekends. That's one whole day for you to socialize. In addition, keep in mind that most students spend their weekend doing homework and studying. I would hate to be Japanese.  And sleepovers! Not so much now, but my childhood was fulfilled almost exclusively through sleepovers. Now, imagine if you could only have a sleepover Saturday night, and Saturday had to be spent at school, and Sunday you had to work. That would suck....penis.  Giboc and I are losers. We spent a good chunk of an hour yesterday discussing giant robots. In summary: a:Transformers was an American show. The movie may have been made in Japan. b:The robotics team is going to build us all robots. Namely:  b1:The Usaginator for myself  b2:The ROTOC for Giboc(Robot On Top Of Car)  b3:The Jewish Princess for Gabe  b4:The Hon Hon Hon Mistress for Gabrielle  b5:The Prom Dress Shopper for Lizzy  b6:The Dumper for Claudia(she's gonna kill me for that one)  b7:The Grammar Teacher for Jonathan  b8:Mega Radzinski(a giant giant robot piloted by the three Radzinski siblings)  b9:The Brahma Fighting Cow for Amanda Huggenkiss  b10: and something for other people too. c:Xenogears ownz j00 d:Cloud is sexy and gay e:I'm gay. f:So is Schmarc.   Good times
