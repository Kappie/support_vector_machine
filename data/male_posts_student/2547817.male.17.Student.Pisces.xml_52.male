Spoke with Joe for a while and we sang sentimental songs while Chris tried to play the piano. Somewhere out there, Right here waiting for you. If we hold on together...  While I was walking out of school, Eugenia told me that Zel was in class. I smiled in denial and quietly walked off. Till now, I wonder if she was in class.  I love this girl. I'm grown up now and I think I should know the difference between love and infatuation.  It's odd today coz smallville seemed to be speaking to me. Lana always reminded me of her. I know not why. 'Neway, she and Clark got into some riff coz she wanted to date someone else and he got jealous... And she was like, "Look, we're not together anymore, so deal with it". My life is indeed a stage.  I had to delete all my items from my old phone today. Came across a folder in my message section called "Heart". Inside were all the messages that  Zel sent me, that really mattered. The ones that I'd look to on a blue day. I ached deeply when I read the messages and deleted them one by one. She was my angel.  Wake up Tim.
