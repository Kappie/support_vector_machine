Anyways, I went downstairs, still in my boxers, and heard that 2 people had called: my good friend Jacob Fenton, and (Name Deleted). Now, I called Jacob F. and asked him what he wanted. He wanted me to spend the night. Oh joy. I'm free from dumbass calling me AGAIN. So I called him and said I'd be leaving to come over in about an hour. After hanging up the phone, I didn't even call (Name Deleted). Why? Because he gave me a phone number that isn't even his. Whenever I call it, I get a weird answering machine or somebody saying I have the wrong number. How stupid IS he? We'll never know.  Then I took a shower and posted in the blog. It's my new hobby, actually. After I finished I got all of my D books together, as well as some extra clothes, and headed over to his place. When I got there, his 12-year-old cousin Kyle was over. Kyle is an OK guy. He hasn't pissed me off, yet... He had these stupid ***** 6th and 5th graders yelling at him at the last school dance I went to because some other slut danced with him, and then she told her little friends to go ***** and scream at him about staying the hell away from her. So I'm like "WTF?" and start flipping out at one of her ***** friends when they were yelling at him. She walked away quite shocked.  So we jump in Jacob's pool. It was kinda cold, but it warmed up. Jacob, being an idiot, locked the doors on me and Kyle, after we changed and only had towels around our waists (Jacob has a changing stall outside where there are towels, and we're not allowed in the house with our dripping trunks). He ended up telling Kyle and I that there was a key under a pot near his front door. Man we were idiots. It turned out there wasn't a key, and 2 women were getting out of a car in his neighbor's driveway. They honked at us. We were pissed. Finally he let us in, after Kyle mooned him and started yelling. We dried off and went outside to take part in more idiocy.  Jacob told us that these 8th grade girls (not bad looking actually, they're considered freshmen since they've already passed 8th grade) were having a sleep-over in a tent. I suggested a panty raid, and explained to them both what that was. Kyle asked Jacob to get on his ATV and ride over to see if there was a tent. There wasn't. Damn.  So he and Kyle were riding around on the ATV for a bit, at one point chasing me (I was on foot). After that, Jacob pulled out his riding lawnmower, and attached a sled to it. He drove around the lawn pulling Kyle and I, suddenly accelerating when we were trying to get on, and dragging us through bushes and a pine tree with painful needles. One time, Jacob was pulling me around the yard around this large clump of tall grass, and got stuck. So he backed up at an angle and turned around in the opposite direction I was facing, and ran over my leg. If only the blades were on...  After that "near death experience", we went swimming again at 10:00 PM. This time Jacob and I got out before Kyle and locked him out again. I bet you can tell he wasn't very happy. Then we let him in, watched some Saturday night anime, American Pie, and went to sleep.  We all woke up at around 9:00 AM the next morning, and got dressed and went outside. We set off a crappy smoking tank firework, and went back inside and watched Dumb and Dumberer. Too bad I didn't get to watch the whole thing, since my grandfather picked me up in the middle of it.  In short, yesterday was a fun day, except for the fact that I could've got my leg cut off.
