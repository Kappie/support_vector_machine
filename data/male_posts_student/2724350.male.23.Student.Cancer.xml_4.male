Even her own mom was part of the team! Ended up I thought I was one of the worst victims cos my face was literally all white and brown from the cake. Found out from the party that I wasn't really a social creature cos I felt somewhat out of place during the party(maybe it was because I was the only Physiotherapy student there).  We ended playing Koala Bear(dun ask me why they call it that name). It's actually a game where out of a group of people, two people are chosen to be the koala bear "killers" and another person is assigned to be the angel, who will try to hint to the rest who are the culprits. It was a very interactive and creative game! The game taught me that in life, there will always be times when you thought that someone was the "culprit" for doing something that hurt you. As a result, the other innocent party will inevitably get hurt, without even knowing the reason why! That is why we should never jump to conclusions without the relevant evidence. Therefore, effective communication is the key to such situations. From the many motivational books I read, there is actually a core message:    "It is not what happens to us that changes us, it is how we choose to react that creates the state of mind we are in."   Confucius once said that the wise man is one that guards over his door of thoughts. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be in control, both mental and emotional, whenever something happens that threaten our state of mind. If all of us do so, there will be no hatred, jealousy and most importantly, violence between every living person. Then, a perfect stage will be reached whereby there is true peace where Man ives harmoniously with all things around!
