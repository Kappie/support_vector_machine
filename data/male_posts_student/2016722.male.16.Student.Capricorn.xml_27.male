Yes, it's that bad.) were walking through the park and somehow the Draft came up. The proposed draft states that men and women will be called upon, that college won't keep you safe, and that Canada is no longer a refuge. Arthur is in favor of both men and women being drafted, although not of the draft itself (I think). A draft that doesn't discriminate is attractive, especially when it comes to women's rights. Basic example: Want to vote? Then fight.  My English teacher from school once said, "The women are the mothers, and the men are the defenders." Probably many, especially liberal America, would disagree. I'd tend to agree more with her than with Arthur, and it brings up some important points. I haven't read the whole draft proposal but there's no way they would take a mother and father of the same family. Or even just one parent.. Imagine a working father with his wife gone and having no time to take care of his children. Again, I'm not sure what the proposal says. Also, when someone goes to fight for his country, what is he (or possibly she) really fighting for? Bush? The Glory of America? Oil? I doubt it. His family. Something you can identify with and love. Once you take both sexes into battle the whole atmosphere may change. I'm sure in war people "forget" some of their... Loyalties back at home (many from WWII admit it), because people need escapes in that kind of situation. In general I also think men have an urge to protect the women around them, no matter who they are. In any case, there are many different opinions, and none of them are valid until a draft like they are proposing is actually put into action.   Maybe Arthur is right. A bisexual draft seems inevitable anyway. Better sooner than later.  Good blog:  urlLink The Mesopotamian
