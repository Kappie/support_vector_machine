Now, if we lay out the rest of the day on a timeline, I can't quite figure out why we're leaving so early:  3:00 - Bus leaves HP 4:30 - Bus arrives in Sulphur Springs 7:30 - Game Starts 9:30 - Game ends/Bus leaves Sulphur Springs 11:00-11:30 - Bus arrives at HP  I do have to question the three hour gap in between us arriving there and the start of the game. We need 1 hour to warm up, so I could understand 90 minutes to 2 hours. But 3?? Hope I can find a way to entertain myself; I'll be needing one.
