I'm fucking sweating cats and dogs. I am quite literally shoving felines and canines out the ying yang through my pores, like some redneck earth goddess squatting out the next batch kicking and screaming into the world.  I'm hoping because I think it's hot as hell, but maybe I have a stress fever, which would be cool if only for the lack of stress. I'm under so little stress I don't know what to do, except for the increasing difficulty of Arabic with TA's who really may have problems teaching, and for my own imperative that I need to work out more which I still ignore. Maybe I am under some self imposed stresss that I'm only acknowledging out of my search for something to do and need to feel important enough to affected by something if anything and then so I can complain and be sure thatg I'm still alive because I'm loathing a portion of it. No, thats not true. I'm just loathing the portion of it that doesn't have to do with me, and forcing me to loathe all parts of it. What? I'm rambling, but the backspace key for weaklings. Though i just used it right now to fix a spelling error. There I did it again. Huh.   What the fuck are you bitching about boy? You got nothing better to do? You're just starved for human interaction because you locked yourself out for four hours to finish Catch 22, which is a brilliant book by the way, but everyone already knew that so why focus on that. The Outlaw Sea was also quite good for people interested in such banal subjects, though it sometimes becomes little more than inspired anecdotes at parts. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar looks to be quite good too - maybe this will last me more than a week.  You know why you finish books so fast? BECAUSE YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR ROOM!   That's not true. I just left my room a minute ago!  To get a god damned cup! To get a cup so you could go to the ice machine and drink this box of coke cans you got for free all nice and cold. Whoope de shit!   I have plenty of friends here, you self righteous prick. I'm not fucking lonely or starved for attention. I know exactly where to go when I want to hang out with people. Well, that last parts not true, as I often find myself with no place to go, but when I do the people are cool and I'm making friends and blah and blah so shut the crap up. That's not the issue here! I'm fairly comfortable with my situation here.  Then what is the problem you moron! You nearly cried because in that brief period when you went out someone tried to im you and when you came back you tried back but they were gone! You've essentially convinced yourself you're in love with someone just to make yourself feel better and give you something to think about. Don't go condemning people to perfection.  I was being melodramatic you stupid cock! Jesus christ, just leave me alone. All I need to do is satisfy my worry that I'm not doing enough and then I can go straight back to not doing anything. And don't throw around the l word - people will get the wrong idea. I have no romantic feelings for anyone here, and that will remain that way. I can muse all I want on others if I want. Things to do are things to do, damnit!  You should study more for class.  Fuck class.  Meh, might as well.   Read  urlLink this  and stay informed.  Read  urlLink this  and laugh.  Read  urlLink this , push aside the possible illegalities of the conflict for a short while, think about the people actually suffering, and debate whether compromise/realism is failure.
