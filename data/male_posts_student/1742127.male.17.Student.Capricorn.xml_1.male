I had to go move my Jeep in the middle of a test cuz it was starting to sprinkle. Pretty bad! Well then it cleared up and on my way home from town, running errands for the mommy, it started raining on me, but instead of freakin I just enjoyed it! Not many people can do that! So it was kool.  We're taking out semester tests today and tomorrow. BLahhhh! But the sooner we do it, the sooner it'll be over with. Cuz Thursday all I have is P.E. and I'm actually exempt, sooooo school can officially be out then. Fun funnnn! My mom's like, "RAAR JOB RARR!" LoL Just kidding, she's not freaking too much, she just doesn't like fishing out the money every week for gas. Not my fault! LoL I just drive to school and sometimes to Mikey's!!! :) My Mikey's getting his surgery tomorrow morning. :( I hope it goes well. I'm gonna go see him after school tomorrow, bring him some soup or something. :) Well words low! Adios! ~ChRiStIn
