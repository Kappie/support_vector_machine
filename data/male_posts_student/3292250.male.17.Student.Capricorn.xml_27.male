But when I'm given a you-must-do-this-many-notecards format, I get sick of it. I don't like guidelines placed on my work. I know the point is for kids to be organized and properly cite when writing, but I already do that quite well if I do say so. So 13 pages later (outline and works cited pages included), I'm done. The "recommended length" is 4-6 pages, but I never fit in such ranges. I write a lot, and I write to make a point. I  can  condense my writing, but only in a journalistic way. For a research paper  you need to explain and analyze. Plus, my topic (the freedoms and rights of gays in American government and society) covers Constitutional rights, social issues, and criminal law, and each one of those has 3 supporting instances (i.e.:  Lawrence v. Texas ,  Bowers v. Hardwick , and  Limon v. Kansas  for criminal law).  And now, at 2:19 in the AM the printer has done its work. Good night all, and I'll see you in the morning!
