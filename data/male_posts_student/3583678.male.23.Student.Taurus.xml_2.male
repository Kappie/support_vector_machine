To say the least, it feels great to be back, although I've lost a great deal of stamina since I started my extended break.  It feels good to be working with the club again though.  All of the ranks are doing excellent and they provide the motivation and excitement to want to go back night after night.  Now, I would have preferred having another week to get back into the swing of things before having to demonstrate a technique in front of everybody.  But, then again, Master Pak has the keen sense of knowing when and how to push somebody.  To say the least, the first attempt wasn't "Black Belt" quality.  It was more or less, "Rusty Black Belt been back for 3 practices" quality.  It took maybe 2 or 3 throws before it clicked.  But, it's almost like riding a bike.  Once you learn it, you don't forget it (at least for a very long time).   Check out the  urlLink club website here .  If you live in Ames, please stop by some time and give it a try or watch a practice.  If you have the strange desire to try and make your body do things you'd never think possible, then I think you might like it.  On a side note, most "Hapkido" schools and clubs don't study the same style as we do.  The vast majority of American Hapkido schools are actually much closer to Karate and Taekwondo.  The style we practice is much closer to Judo without the wrestling around.
