Has anyone ever driven an ethanol powered car?? I have. I drove it all though college (I lived in the Midwest). 90% EtOH/10% Petro. The car ran quite well. There was one drawback, however--everytime I filled it up right before work they thought I was drunk because I smelled like a damn brewery. Small price to pay to reduce our dependence on both foreign and domestic fuel. I mean, granted, the ideal situation would be cars that run on water and crap like that, but the techonology for EtOH cars exists NOW. Imagine the midwest turning into the mideast (in terms of wealth resources, not in terms of violence and anti-american sentiment....silly). Hell, right now we throw corn away....it could easily be fermented and distilled to produce a fuel that is cleaner, renewable, and a good transition from fossil fuels to newer fuel sources.That is the only environmental statement I want to make right now. I dont want to talk about forests and wetlands....I dont think I know enough about it, yet.
