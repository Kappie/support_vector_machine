Rotten Tomatoes is the premiere site to go for movie reviews.  They archive all of the major reviews that newspapers, magazines, and others publish for each movie, average the scores for each one, and it determines the movie's rating on the "Tomatometer."  There are two ratings on the Tomatometer, Fresh and Rotten.  If the movie has scored higher than a 60% average, it receives a Fresh Rating.  Anything under 60% gets a rotten rating.    They also cover DVD/VHS, and also videogames, which is nice for people who are looking for archived scores of games, similar to what GameRankings does, which I reviewed last week.  The Tomatopicker helps you find games, so you can check the reviews for each game to determine whether it is fresh or not.   The site also features something called "The Vine," which is like a blog service.  Wow, the things they do for these movie sites now.  Its incredible.  And now that Rotten Tomatoes has been acquired by IGN, you can expect more things to come for the site in the near future.  The site features a design that is quick to load, even on slow connections, and it looks great, too.  Its very clean, which makes it ideal for anyone who is tired of looking at cluttered websites.   urlLink    The "Tomatometer" tells you if the movie is fresh or not, and gives you links to articles that review the movie. urlLink     Overall, I think this is the best site that I have reviewed so far.  It's a lot of fun to look at, very helpful in deciding what movies to see, what DVDs and games to buy, and a great site all around.  This site receives my first ever "Site of the Month" award.  Congratulations.   Pros  +Nice design +Archives for movie reviews +Tomatometer tells you if its fresh or not +Also covers games and DVDS/VHS   Cons  -The fact that I can't find any cons!
