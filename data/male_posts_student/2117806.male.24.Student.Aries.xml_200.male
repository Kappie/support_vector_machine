It was your typical summer blockbuster/special CGI effects extravaganza, and about what I expected. Was worth the $1.50 I paid, but I don't think I'd have paid full price for it. It had the same spirit as  Pitch Black , but wasn't nearly as neat as that movie. Some of the CGI was too obviously CGI, but that's what you expect out of a flick like this. It's a good popcorn movie, and would probably be worth a rental if you're in the mood for Vin Diesel.  It's really...cool outside today. The temperature dropped pretty good yesterday afternoon when I went to go get my car out of the shop, mostly because it started pouring down rain. Even with my umberella (which I realized I left in Dom's truck), I was still pretty soggy just walking from my apartment door to his truck. But it did cool things off, and today's simply continued that trend. It's in the mid-70s out there, with a slight breeze, and about 80% humidity, so it feels a bit thick. But still, it's nice, if a bit too cloudy for my tastes. See, when it's cloudy, I tend to not want to get out of bed. That was the case today, as I didn't drag my sorry butt out of bed until 3.00 pm.  So I figured I need to draw a total of six comics before Tuesday so I have enough done for the coming weeks while I'm gone. I've got one done so far, and only a couple of days left to do the other five. But I've got the next several comics scripted out already, so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle getting the five done...I hope.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Dandy Warhols, "Minnesoter"
