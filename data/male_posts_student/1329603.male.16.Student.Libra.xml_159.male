Well... my voice is paralysed. Yes, peoples, with the Pates concert tomorrow, my voice has become paralysed. Hello Strepsils. I mean... seriously... fargh...  I'm also not feeling very well, to be honest. It's possible I've caught a minor version of Spanish fever - this sucks, especially because, as a lot of you will know, I don't like Spain. If you didn't know that, you probably think I'm a racist now. In actuality I have nothing wrong with the people. Just the accent, the language, the flag, the music, the way of life etc.  Les Mis, despite the fact my voice was deteriorating, was actually pretty cool yesterday. Got on better with everyone on the whole, and in fact made contact with some of the littler people, which was nice, because usually they just stand about 25 metres away. Got on alright with N'omi, there's not a lot to say on that matter, got on well with Joe, Barley, Jack, Phil, Josie, Christine and Liv. Although I'm still scared of Liv. She sat on my lap, and if you know anything about me then you'll know that's enough to make me run for the hills. Oh, and Ig, I didn't beat Josie up with a stick. I asked her and she said I didn't.  Oh, CAYO-wise, got on really well with Jasmin and Adele over the Saturday rehearsals and the bowling, so that was nice. It was better than trying to talk to Andy by going through Beccay who still terrifies me. I would have preferred if Jazz hadn't started telling people that I was in love with Adele, though. That's just... wrong...  Anyway, pretty tired, and sorry to give you this picture but I'm in a towel. I'm off to get dressed.  Quote of the day: "Her name was Eponine. Her life was cold, and dark, But she was unafraid."  From   Just after A Little Fall of Rain   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
