Then at around 11.30pm I noticed she still hadn't messaged me for a long time and I started to get worried. I text her a few times telling her to let me know if she was ok or something... but no reply. I grabbed some money and ran to a phonebox. On my way I got a message saying she is ok and her battery had run out. That explains it! I was on my way anyway so I carried on running and called her and told her I loved her. I think a lot of people don't believe the way I feel about Mandy is real because I have good things to say about my past relationships... they just usually end badly (my luck) but because I have good things to say about them they think things I say now aren't really meant... if you know what I mean. I know what I mean. And I know what I feel is real. I love you Mandy. xx
