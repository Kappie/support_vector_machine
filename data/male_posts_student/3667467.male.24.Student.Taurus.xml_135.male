The man on the other end identified himself as a Chief Operations Officer for the company:  Him: Is this Frederick Schrock? Me: Yes... H: How are you doing today? M: Good, good... H: We recently found out that you were traveling to Europe in the next few months, and we were wondering if you would be a Secret Shopper for us in some of our franchises there. M: ...Um, sure...It depends on where they are, though. H: Well, we have several locations in the area of Bielefield, Germany. M: Really? I'll just happen to be staying there. H: That's excellent! ... By the way, Fred, it's Ed. How've you been?  Ed called from Germany. I haven't heard from him for three months, and got my work number from a friend in Nashville. He totally pranked me, dude, and he did it from 4000 miles away. Is that a world record?   "So a pirate walks into a bar. There's a steering wheel attached to his fly. The bartender goes, "Hey, what the steering wheel doing sticking out of your pants?" And the pirate goes, "Arrr! It's driving me nuts!" --Tim Schrock, AKA DJ Middle Finger
