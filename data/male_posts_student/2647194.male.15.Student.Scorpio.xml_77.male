As for today, it went well, em, the school day did anyhow.  Biology: watched a movie on global demographic changes  Spanish: Watched "The Princess Bride". I listened to Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band, The Fire Inside, and U2, All That You Can't Leave Behind. Portable audio rocks...and I put a cool color scheme on the top, so now it looks good.  Study Hall: studied a bit for the social CE test, listened to some more music. I want the Evanescence cd though...  Social: the test was pretty simple, and I got a 48/50  After school: I went over to the Y to shoot pool, which is what I might go do tonight again. Oh yeah, and I know you'll all say "WHAT?!" at this, but Amanda and I aren't going out anymore. yep, its over, so you can kill me and not have anyone care...lol j/k. but yeah...  Kinda odd how they were playing Three Days Grace's hit song at the Y today right before I had to leave...
