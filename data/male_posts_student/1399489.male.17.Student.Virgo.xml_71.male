It all started out when i woke up at about 8:30.  i got up read my little purpose driven book and went down and cooked some breakfast, egg and bacon wraps to be exact. as i was eating i got a call from bryndan and me and my mother picked him up at wendys, along with my neice katie, on the way to sams.  It was at sams that we played with things, got free samples and finally, got the seniors presents.  after our adventures at sams, we came back to my hizzouse.  when we got home, my father was, once again, was alsleep and not responding, and at this point we left to go fishing, it was suppose to be with ben also, but he stayed at hannah's and disbanded us once more.  we didnt do a whole lot of fishing, we mostly just absorbed sun, which by the way greatly improved my tan!  after the lake we came back and bryndan was dropped off at steffany's  (sp?) house by myself.  after this i left, all alone, and began my journey to find a party.  i called callie, then lizzy, then bryndan, then hannah and i finally had the answer, two parties (mikey or marjory) i picked the latter.  it was great fun, me and callie rode together (less gas and safer driver) and the whoop juice was good, i was greatly dissapointed at the fact the jessica couldnt be there though (but i bet she is having a great time getting hit on at the frat parties), a few of her own friends were even there (casey, amanda, and sarah).  after the party i came home and that brings me to my current state and position at the computer.   HAHA i dont know why i typed my blog in that manner of speech but i just wanted to be different tonight and well it was.  ok well im headed to bed now.  Good night folks
