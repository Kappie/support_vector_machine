Tomorrow I have a Habitat for Humanity thing.  urlLink The Teensters . We are building homes with Habitat for Humanity. We start tomorrow. Then I will be going to the  urlLink Bite of Las Vegas . It should be fun. Then on Sunday I'm gonna enjoy my day off, and do some Physics homework. That is my weekend. Oh yea!
