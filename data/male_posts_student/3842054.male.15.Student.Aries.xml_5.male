Waking up at noon is weird sometimes because you look outside, you see the sun halfway up, but then you think, "There is no way it is noon." And then you look at your cell phone, and it is, and the day is wasted. Also what is weird it when it is four oclock, it is late in the afternoon, but you've only been awake for four hours. Yeah.    So, I woke up at noon. Then i took a shower. Then i played basketball.  I watched tv, and reallly  did nothing the whole day.  HAd a good dinner though, Grilled Cheese with Tomatoe. YEAH!!! Then i played more basketball, and ive basically been on the phone and watching tv/computer the rest of today.    I had a big conflict with the Warped Tour today, but it looks like its a definate that im going.  Another conflict is about this whole Dreyfoos starting at 8:00 thing... check out Alex Pouilles (sp?) blog... he explains it well...   urlLink www.dreyfoos.blogspot.com    Yeah, so if it starts a half hour earlier, that means i have to wake up earlier, and have to be in Kileys (Italion Class) class that much earlier.  But, i do get out of school htat much earlier... ehhh, i dont know. Who cares? as long as im there....    So, lyrics time...  You know what, i think im going to use the song that i used in my title today cuz thats like the only song i listened to today so yeah...    The Juliana Theory  Bring It Low    So tell me is it hard to see   The possibilities   That I am not the person that I seem      I'll show you anything inside,   Will you open up your mind?   Cause I'm more like you than   You may ever know      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      So baby was a shooting star   She crawled into my heart   But time revealed that she was fading out      Now choke everything you feel   And as it all conceals   and never heals   You always feel alone   We always feel alone      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      You'll play it again   You're gonna let it go   You never waited this way   No, you want it all      Noone lives [x6]   We're coming again      We'll play it again   We're gonna let it go   Nobody's waiting this way   We're gonna lose it all      I'm on my way   I gotta go   I'm on my way   And I want it now
