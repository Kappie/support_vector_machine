I enjoy a good Hell in a Cell match, but I don't want to see the concept overused.  And despite what you say, Pedro, I happen to like the Chamber of Elimination.  That's another concept I'd like to see done on a rare basis.  So anyway, here's my favorite Cell matches (I'm old and senile, so forgive me for not having the dates or PPV's):   Mankind vs The Undertaker:  C'mon...I think this is everyone's favorite Cell match.  Foley risked his freaking life in that match.  Jim Ross' commentary still rings in my head (along with several other voices, but we won't go there...).  Not only did Foley go off the top of the cell into the announce table, but he managed to battle back and climb the cage again only to get thrown though the top onto the mat.  I remember as soon as he hit the mat, a bunch of officials and EMT's hit the ring thinking he was dead (or something).  That wasn't scripted, it was pure shoot.  Foley was fine though and finished the match.  Pure classic.   Cactus Jack vs HHH :  This was Foley's retirement match, and boy did he go out in style!  Being thrown on a pile of thumbtacks, getting whacked with chairs, etc.  I hope when I retire from whatever I do, I can go out with that kind of bang!   Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar:  The reason I mention this match is not so much that it was a special match, but that it truly signalled the fact that Brock Lesnar is the real deal.  He had won the belt from The Rock a few months before, but I still wasn't sure about him.  In this match, he took everything Taker threw at him, got bloodied, battered, and abused, then showed up for work the next day.  That's when I knew Brock was here to say, and was truly a special wrestler.  (Was that a run-on sentence?)  All this Hell in a Cell talk reminds me of the NWA's War Games matches from back in the day.  Maybe I'll write about some of those someday.   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment
