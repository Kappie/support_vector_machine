He has the most fantastic eyes, I don't even think there is a word for the colour that they are. It's kinda like the colour of the ocean except really light. And he has the nicest hair, it's really dark brown - almost black. He keeps it hidden under a trucker ha, which is a similar colour to his eyes. He has a really simple goatee too just a parch under his chin. All of his clothes match his hat and his eyes. Well, at least i know he's gay *giggles*  This guy is so hot he defines the word Hotacular. If you type into google "Define: Hotacular" it will have a picture of him. If you type in just "hotacular" into google and then hit I'm Feeling Lucky it will take you to a picture of him.   Only problem is I think he thinks I'm a wierdo. I forgot to shave I forgot deoderant I didn't have paper / pen so I got the tutor to write her email on my arm I probably had a red mark on my face from leaning on my arm I'm Canadian
