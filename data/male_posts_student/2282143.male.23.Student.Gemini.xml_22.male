Crazy night.  Lark is getting arrested tomorrow.  Her law firm is being held in contempt (I think she said it was No Comply for all you law buffs out there...) so since she is doing nothing special for Christmas (as she is single and her family lives in Arkansas) she was volunteered to do the time.  And this is scary because if the judge feels like it, then she REALLY goes to jail.  26th and California.  County.  Craziness.  So I hope she doesnt go to jail, but she said I could be her one phone call!  Anyways, gonna hang out with Sammy.  Chill.  Oh yeah.
