Potentially a breed of the stupidest human beings on the planet, this particular strain of French Canadian (Fidous Frenchus Assholus Cocknockerus Homo Stupidus) is responsible for the throbbing vein now occupying space on my forehead. Worse yet, they've somehow decided I own them money(I don't) and at the same time they've decided that money is overdue (it isn't) and that they should send it to a collections agency (that may be the last mistake they ever make). So I get to explain to a bunch of grasping-with-the-language fucks about how I don't owe them money. They agree I don't, but still want me to pay it. Fuckem.  I swear to god, even this isn't wrapped up in less than 21 days, I'll do something drastic. Smoking fucking crater drastic.
