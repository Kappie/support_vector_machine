That little girl changed his life...she made him want to live again...He would have died for her...He DID die for her....Sounds familiar.  Yes. She saved my life. She pulled me from the throes of death. I have her to thank for my life. Was it her saving me that made me fall in love with her? Does it matter!?  Apparently, at times I make her feel like I'm better than her. I'm better than HER!? HA! I don't recall me ever saving MY life, now do I?  To whom do I owe my sucess?  To whom do I owe my talent?  My life!? HER!  She doesn't spin lies. She doesn't hate like I do. She's just as smart, if not smarter than I am! Bah. It's the whole self esteem thing.  Nobody is better than anybody else. Perhaps some people are better at some things than others. Lance Armstrong can ride a bike faster than I can, but he isn't better than me. Albert Einstein can build a device of mass destruction better than I can, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's better than I am. Bah.  What is perfection?  Perfection is intangible, it is unreal. And, as you can see, I am a rather big fan of reality. I take what I can see. Real. Much better that way.  Truth. Much better that way. I like to stand for truth, but then I went and told a bunch of lies and hurt a bunch a people. I'm a god damn hypocrit. Which rhymes with Hippie! AND I HATE HIPPIES! Ahem...ANYWAYS....  God, I can't believe it sometimes. I cannot even begin to comprehend the pain I've caused her...Jesus Christ...I tried to do everything in my power to make her happy, and I couldn't even do that, in fact, I ended up doing the exact opposite! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK GOD DAMN FUCK WHORE FUCK BITCH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK DAMN BASTARD PRICK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT DAMN FUCK SHIT DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT PRICK MOTHERFUCKER FUCK FUCKING FUCK SHIT SHIT BITCH SHIT BASTARD JERK PRICK JERK JERK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK SHIT FUCK SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCKING FUCK GOD DAMN IT!  Wow, I'm not angry. FUCK! I did what I did, and she gets really sad and upset, and posts this big thing on her blog about how I don't love her, how much o fa jerk I am, etc. And then I get angry at her!? Who the fuck do I think I am? As if I don't deserve to feel like shit.  I had what, like 4 friends, and I fucking threw that away. I don't deserve friends, I've come to realize that.  Should I just pick up my things and run for the hills? Seems that way, doesn't it?
