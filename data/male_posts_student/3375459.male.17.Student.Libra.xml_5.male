So many things I never take the time to notice before. I want to sleep for a few more minutes, but I can't seem to fall asleep. The sun's still rising, I'm still aching from yesterday, but like what people say, "no pain, no gain"  "shuo ting, kuo ting (if you stop working, you stop the feeding too)".  AHhhh! Its another day of work, another day filled in advance. Hopefully everyone does their job and we can wrap things up and get paid earlier. Heheheheeee..... Could we skip the commission thingy? For now, it feels good to work once in while, keeps me thinking "I should enjoy my holidays even more now that I've got lots of them". Ah, I'm going to have my breakfast. Chiao!
