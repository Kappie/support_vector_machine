I wasn't concentrating hard enough and managed to fully do only 4 out of 7 questions, with the rest barely attempted. I'm so annoyed with myself that I didn't take in any tissues and that I let myslef get so distracted. Hopefully I'll scrape in with a B. Anything less and I'll probably have to re-sit the exam. Grr..  I've now got two free weeks before all Hell breaks loose with all my remaining exams in a single week. The bastards have put 2 Geography papers, 2 Maths papers and 2 Computing papers in 5 days. I can't wait for this to be over with!  I think I'm going to relax this afternoon; sit out if it's sunny, play a few games and maybe write a review.
