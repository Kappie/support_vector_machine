I keep failing it and it keeps adding to my stress levels sometimes you just feel like giving it all up and quitting!   Again, it hurts me the way the subject is so vindictive! It hurts me! It goes all out to get me, revenge against me! but what had i done to it? It despises me as i despise it, it plays mind games with me, what am i suppose to do? I could be fretting for a test i had very little idea on how to do...and manage to scrape a pass one week and spend the next cramming and practicing for the next. And YET! again and again it stumbles me, i know the method, the technique but i just cannot get around the obstacle of horrible luck, you sometimes feel it is all an elaborate plot to get you!  I saw the paper and smiled fortune shone down upon me, i started at it furiously plannign on improving my grade on this test. It was rather smooth going maybe not all that easy but it was managable...then came the second question...(the paper is made up of two questions) It was such a give away....  I completed it in good time, what a relieve, and then i realised my graph was drawn backwards, all the numbers were wrong the axises were both wrong!arghhhh  I stared at the clock and my watch confirmed my fate... i had five minutes left... school was out, i had failed yet another test, my plans to catch a movie shelfed i left...annoyed, hurt and angry.  The mind heals but the heart is torn asunder...
