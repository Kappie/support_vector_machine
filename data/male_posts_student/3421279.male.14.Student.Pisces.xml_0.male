In the end, my friend found it at Century Square and helped me buy it.  I was so grateful.  Anyway, you can go get it now.  It costs $17.90 in Sembawang stores and it comes with a poster of her and a secret password to enter a contest to win tickets to her private concert.  Quickly get the album now, the posters are limited and the contest ends on 31st July. Signing off ;)
