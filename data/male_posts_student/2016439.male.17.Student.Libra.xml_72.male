The more things change, the more freakishly messed up, warped, and morphed beyond recognition they seem.  Case in point: I went to Gatesville with my parents today to attend church and visit with my grandmother for Mother's Day.  I never could shake this feeling of being out of place.  Mind you, I love Gatesville and I have many friends, young and old, out there; nevertheless, I felt so alien.  Was it the way they were looking at me?  Perhaps it is my own person that has "morphed beyond recognition"?  It wasn't one of those oh-my-God-I'm-an-anemone-in-a-sea-of-clownfish kinds of feelings, but rather just like a little gnat that persisted in slightly irritating me for the whole day.  However, I had a great time today.  Mother's Day is either one of the best days or the worst days of the year for me.  Luckily, it was one of the best this go-round.  I woke up and presented my mother with a quarter-bouquet of flowers and a card and got some things (all good) off my chest about our relationship.  It was pretty neat.  I often dwell on the negative too much here at home, so it was good to step back, take a deep breath, and start to look at the bright side of things at home.  Not everything is bad.  Well, everything except that I'm not going to be going to prom after all.  How's that for a clincher!  Actually, I found out yesterday, so it didn't mar today too much.  Due to a series of events, miscommunications, and mistakes on my part, I shan't be going to prom this year.  To tell the truth, I'm kind of relieved.  I've felt really uncomfortable with this whole prom thing this year.  I don't know if I ever really got into the whole "going" thing: I didn't ask anyone, I hadn't yet made plans to get a tux, and I really had no clue as to what our prom group was going to be doing.  Maybe it's best that it worked out this way.  I'm quite excited that we only have two real weeks of school left, and then finals week.  I'm ready to get into summer: there's a lot to do and a lot to plan.  When I spoke to my Division Commander (more Young Marine talk here), he old me that I'll probably be traveling with him to encampments in Louisiana, Kansas, and Colorado.  That's pretty cool seeing as I have been to neither three of those states.  Plus, I've gotta get a job.  Dear God, I  have  to get a job.  And pronto!  P.S.  I'm likin' the new blogger layout.  It seems so...primary school, and I just LOOOOOOVE primary school!
