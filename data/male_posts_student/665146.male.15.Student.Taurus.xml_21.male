Some gay guys hit on Katie’s dad.  It's what he gets for wearing a Hawaiian shirt.        "Only two types of people wear Hawaiian shirts, gay guys and big fat party animals, and Bart doesn't look like a big fat party animal."                                                                --Homer Simpson  Ok, so I've reached a new low by quoting the Simpsons, but I can't get much lower than that.  Please, find a better example of a Hawaiian shirt/Gay guy deal, and I'll put it there.  I just need some feedback for this place.   Man, I really hate the Powerpuff Girls...  It's like someone swallowed a glow stick, ate some marshmallows, took a heavy hit of acid, and took a giant dump.  As explicit as that sounds, that's the best as I can explain it.  They go around and kill people who don't look as cute as they think they are.  Cute?!  Where the hell are their necks??? Now they have a movie.  God, please send the Cartoon Network to the 7th circle of hell so that they may feel the pain the Powerpuff Girls have caused.  All right, so that went a little far, how about just setting fire to the Powerpuff Studios?  For those of you who do like them, I apologize for what I am about to say and mean you no harm.  I'm not saying any of this is your fault, I’m not trying to sound like a conspirator, but this just something I see to be created by the companies.         You have been brainwashed by cutesy subliminal messages and one day when the world is in chaos, you will all rise up as a giant, mindless army.  Legions of you will raid the land killing the ugly, the intelligent, and anyone with an opinion that wasn't created by advertisements.  Those you had left behind will be swallowed in the flames of ignorance.  A post-apocalyptic earth will cry out in anguish (I know I'm going a bit far, but stay with me on this one) as all life is wiped away to make room for and supply corporations.  After it's all over, the only use for the armies is fuel for the fire, and you will willingly march into the incinerator all for those cute, fluffy, little, neck less Powerpuff Girls.             Remember, keep your own mind, don't fall victim to what is said to be.  Like I always say, "If it's cute and fluffy, it's probably trying to kill you."  I know I had more to say, but I think I've gone far enough.    Go America.........  Cutesy cartoons need a home to plot the dumbing of the world.....
