I listened the Top 100 Countdown straight. You see, there's this contest la. Send in your prediction for the top song, and you may win cash and CDs. I sent in 3 predictions: Dido's White Flag, Black Eyed Peas's Where Is The Love and Clay aiken's Invisible. HaHa. When it was counting down from number 5 onwards, the moment is so exciting and tense! Me, Mel, XC and HM were furiously discussing the songs. HaHa. Soon, number 1 and none of my predictions appeared yet. So nervous! HaHa....then, suddenly, Where's The Love got number 1! YAY!! I have a chance! Now, I started getting real nervous. HaHa. They anniounced the winner. It was a guy. Oh my god....hope! They announced the IC number. S--8(oh god!!)--7(oh my god!!  heart was really thumping!)--4..... WHAT?!!! Oh my god! I nearly won!! I nearly won!! HaHa....I still haven't got over the shock of nearly winning.  After that, I watched Charmed (Necromancing The Stone. Nice episode! I love the wiccanning at the end!). Then, I went out to play with my neighboutrs, counting down till 1st January 2004. HaHa. We played cards and firecrackers. We long timed never played le. I miss the good old days. Yeah. We are playing again this coming CNY's Eve. Wee!   THURSDAY   Okay, I came back and looked at the chat transcript. Boy,I was so damn pissed off at Benjamin. Firstly, he called CQ *toot*. Then,. he expressed his displeasure at me not coming back on time (apparently, they needed me to discuss soemthing) by saying things about me and used an ugly emoticon to depict me. I wasn't really that angry with him for that, but the fact is that he insulted CQ right before he insulted me made me real pissed off. No one, I repeat no one, insults/hurts CQ. I simply won't take it lying down. That fucker. I sent a really spiteful email to that scumbag (actually, not really that spiteful. I was very tired le. It was kinda mild lor...). He actually dared to deny these! Excuse me, even XC also saw lor. That r-a-t. Stinko rat. Nobody insults me and CQ and gets away with it. I made sure they don't. He thinks he's so clever and noble. Phooey! If he's that clever, he wouldn't have lost to me for 2 years. Scoring low pathetic marks. He dissed me for going to sub science too....hao lian. Think you go into Pure Science so good issit? (The teachers who let you go Pure Science is either stupid or pity you so much or like you (ha! pai ma pi jing!)) Even XC is more humble. He did not suan Sub Science and think he's so much better than us. Ha! Loser!  Okay. I went to sleep and woke up about 6 hours later. HaHa. The morning was not so bad la...it's my last morning as a free person, so gotta enjoy it much. I watched yesterday's Ben Yue. HaHa. I even have it taped, because I wanna listen to the countdown.  In the afternoon, I watched the VCD How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.  The VCD had some cracks...so hyad to fast forward some scenes. HaHa. Overall, it's a good movie. Nice plot and all....HeHe. :D "Bullshit!"  At night, I came online lor.HaHa. Had this argument with Ben, and I didn't blog. Yeah....moo meow! I downloaded Dido's White Flag into my handphone. Ha.   THURSDAY   I woke up at 5.30. Woah! So bu xi guan....after many days of waking up late. HaHa. Hmm....took my father's cab to CCK MRT to meet my friends. Me, CQ, Hann, PeiYing,  Tina, LeYu, Kelvin, Johan and WeeKiat met there to go PJ together. We took a crowded 190 bus there.  Woah...there are so many students going to PJ. We Riverisidians were like such a small group. O.o!!! We were all in different Orientation groups. I am in Group 3....Woo!   We had to register ourselves and get the Subject Combi form. I was like quite annoyed. There were two particulars wrong. My religion is not Taoism. I want to strike it out and put "Wicca", but nahh....after all, you can incorporate Taosim into Wicca..... The next one is the most qi shu lin part! Due to me failing A-Maths, I have only two subjects combinations offered: Maths C, Chem/Phy and Econs. Stupid!! I detest Econs lor...I am appealing for Bio. I can't see why I can't take Bio lor. Stupid school.  Woah lao. The two hours of talk is so toturous, and boring! My legs were all numb, especially the right leg. It lost all feelings at the end of the two-hour talk...I can't barely even stand straight... how toturous. I only listened at the appeal part....that's the only thing that interest me and that I care about.  Groups 1-15 go down to break after the talk. Me, Hann and CQ were in these groups, so we met up la. Hann is also in the same predicatament as me. We decided that if our appeal turns out unsuccessful, we would rather quit school. I mean, we hate Econs and see no point in studying if we cna't get to study Bio. I decided to find a job, either at Metro, Shop and Save or Popular. HaHa. So fun! I was kinda secretly hoping to lose the appeal la....working seems so fun...but choy!  I wanna study also! Ha!  After that, it's ice breaker games. I found out that Ming Yao is in the same group as me! I totally can't recongize him lor. HeHe. He's so much more taller and slimer now. HaHa! Finally! I have somebody to talk to! HaHa!! We played ice breaker games, including the wacko. HaHa. They everytime call me one. Maybe Kelvin the name is too easy to remember ba! HaHa! We played games till12 lor...  After dismissal, I went to get an appeal form and appealed lor. I wrote a lot la. I forgot to write that I only lack 6 points to pass A-maths. However, I did suan Econs very badly lor ("I am sure PJC would prefer a student scoring well in Bio than a student scoring badly in Econs" and "I hate Econs from the get-go. I have totally no interest in it")  I expressed my great interest in Bio ("Bio is my life. It will be. It is so." corny, I know. But I am desperate!). HaHa!   We all go back lor. CQ went back. Hann and PY went to Sembawang, go back to school. I went to Causeway Point to look for Wendy. HaHa. Find her to talk la. I found her after few minutes of searching.   We went to eat lunch together. She eat something noodles, and I ate kuay chap. HaHa. We caught uip with each other lor. We can talk face to face...after all, these day we are talking through MSN chat. Not very personal. HaHa. We talk and talk and talk and continue talking while she work. HaHa. We made several trips up to the third floor linen department to get some stocks. (The escalator in Metro leading from the first floor to the second floor has a strong fried chicken smell. Wendy said it always has been there. Creepy wor! I think hor, the smell is there because a guy eating chicken slipped from the escalator and fell to his death...hahaha!! silly theory!).   I went home at 4+, because Wendy had to take stocks from the storeroom and be very busy.HaHa. Had a good time chatting with her. :)  Hmm...went home le, bathed and came online. Oh yes, Mrs Chew is not my brother's chem teacher. Damn!! I even slept for awhile. So sleepy. *Yawn*  Hmm...that's all lor.I think I end le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
