I only have four (maybe 5) front teeth that aren't filled (yet). Give it time.       I went to the dentist Monday afternoon as I may have mentioned in the previous blog. Every one of the 6 month appointments I have ever had has led to more fillings, root canals, apisectomies... let's face it, my teeth are not known for their robust qualities. In fact the dentist has said (more than once) that my fillings are stronger than my teeth. Marvellous.       This time I only had to have one tiny filling in a tooth with no nerve. Fantastic. I was extremely pleased (sad, I know). Unfortunately today I had a phonecall from my dentist saying that actually the X-rays showed another filling that needed doing.       Maybe dentures are the way to go? Knowing my luck (which seems to be bad verging on awful atm) I would have badly fitting false teeth that would give me ulcers. Maybe I'll keep my own teeth. Assuming that they let me.
