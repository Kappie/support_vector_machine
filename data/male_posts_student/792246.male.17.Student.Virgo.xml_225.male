Maybe Kelly is right, maybe I'm incredibly paranoid. I thought all these people hated me who don't, so I guess it's the only realistic explanation. I think I just don't know how to handle being accepted. It's a relatively new concept for me after all. It's that cliched you wish for something so hard and then when it happens you don't know how to deal with it. I think I just missed my chance as a kid to learn how to deal with people. My instinct with anything I don't understand is that the person hates me and I hide. It happened again today. Kelly and I ran into Zoe at the Stanford, I got a cold vibe, I assumed she didn't like me. These events happen with me all the freaking time. It's time for me to grow up and, I don't know, not be a big freak show.
