They actually listened to me, or at least prtended to.  Then I hung out with Laura.  A whole bunch of people wanted to meet me.  I had to go talk to her best freind and her grandparents.  It was cool, I kind of wanted to meet them anyway.  Then we went back to her house and just chilled there.  I had to leave her at 5 though, because I had to go see my uncel.  He is the coolest uncle in the world.  To start he manages 4 comic boook stores, and will end up owning the chain.  His comic book stores just got arcade games, and he invited us down to one to play them for free.  So, after he closed down the store he made it so that we could play them for free.  It was awesome.  Then I went to an Eagle Court of Honor today.  It was ok.  Then I just have sat around the rest of the day.  Well, that is all.  See ya.
