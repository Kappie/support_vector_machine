Loosely based on a poem i wrote many posts back with the same name.    The Piece     As the wind passed the curtain, Fraying crisp fabric, chilling warm air. Bygone notes, abandoned rhythms. Forgetting the piece you taught me how to play. Skirting past harmonic minor,  Barely reaching the one-half step. Remembering when fingers danced, On ivories and on a string,  Never mind forgotten dinners,  And tears which flew past in here. Sacrificing much for this piece, Not unlike Jason searching for the Golden Fleece. But time to leave this musty room, For etched between these keys, nothing, but endless gloom.
