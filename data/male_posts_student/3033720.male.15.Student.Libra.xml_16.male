I guess I should go do homework now.....people should call me, I get lonely. I'd post my number, but you can find it on desks at the school with the words above it, "For a good time call:", so you all can just get it there. Saturday Daniel is supposed to fight this GP guy. Like an idiot I'm gonna back the racist up. Oh well. So I guess I'm goin to the movies friday and saturday........  Look! A really big bass saxophone!!     Now that's what I wanna play next year.  By the way, we will all miss you next year Cassy.
