SCHOOOOOOOLLLLL!!!!.... yeah i forgot how much i hate it .. all of the politics ... all of the kids showing off and all of that shit... all of the stubborn teachers who can't accomodate you, even though you apply yourself and try and all... wow ... i think hell would be a high school called Hudson High... i dunno.. its not like i dont have friends... i have loads of them... its not like i am bad in school... i take AP classes... but i just hate it.... something about it... the smell.. the feelings ... the disgust... UHHH... school....  i am stuck im purgatory for two more years... but at least heaven is around the corner
