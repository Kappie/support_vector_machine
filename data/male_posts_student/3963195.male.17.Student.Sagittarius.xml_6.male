It has been two and a half week since they had come……….how fast did the days go…I feel very sad to leave them………it will take another three to four years for their next arrival to India……… 		Today amma and I went to their house. We did not play Uno or Jenga or play station as usual but just sat there staring at each other and taking about tomorrows long journey………..Actually I was very sad and I saw Vichu’s eyes filled with tears when ammuma told about their long absence……………
