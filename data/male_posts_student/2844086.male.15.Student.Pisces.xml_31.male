I know some people practice a lot more than that, but I'm really happy with an hour. I'd like to get up to about an hour and a half a day.  So anyway, here's my log:  Scales  - Sounded really nice today! I'm very pleased, though I stumbled on A Major a little just because I wanted to play A minor first I guess! :)  Cadences  - I really didn't want to play Cadences today, but I did. And you know they go by really fast once you start playing them. All were very good.  Hanon  - I HATE Hanon #7!!! It's like way hard. I mean I knew the guy was crazy, but he was just insane!!  Technic  - "Snowmobiling" is still in progress, yet it still needs lots of work. And I'm still practicing my inversions which make it easier. But broken chord inversions are just hard!  Piano  - I'm played "Reveille" perfectly today!! I mean I got all the turns and everything was on time! OHH! That makes me smile!   Spinning Song   - Ok I know I should have, but I did. I put my hands together. Hey don't worry it wasn't really practice, because it all fell apart. :) But I did practice it like I should. I hate practicing the left hand though, it's so redundant, and I lose my place ... and it's frustrating!  I've been thinking again. Since I am a voice student, maybe I should post that practice too. Which there's nothing really to that, but I could still do it. I'll think about it.
