(duh.) still.. i dropped physics as 4 sum of u know.. i  HATE IT TO THE CORE!!!  ]     so yeah.. chem realli kinda sucks now.. isnt that i dun understand.. wait.. actualli i dunt.. but aniwae.. it more of distraction.. everytime i start my work.. i get distracted by either the comp.. or the tv.. or my guitar and yeah.. other stuff.. still.. i try.. i try.. and still cant get myself to at least touch and memorise sum chem facts..    well.. wats passed has passed.. cant do much bout it now.. unless i invent a time machine which i cant cause i need physics to do that and a LOT of time.. which frankly speaking.. time that i do not have now.. oh well..
