What is the most common thread of life between everthing living, is it that fact that we ARE alive or that we will all die. I have been thinking alot, I have been drinking some too.   I went to the library today and picked up two books on human evolution and a book on the history of mexico. I hope I can find the time to read all three. The darwin book, i dove into it already, seems like some tough reading - interesting at the same time.   The course of my goals has changed over the years, and I guess I can expect it to change a few more times. Hopefully I can stay the course, see the end of the road before I decide to turn down a side street.   Intoxicated by all around me, I only know that who I am is who I make myself out to be. Understandably, that is what faces each of us. For some reasons, I think I shall like who I am very much..
