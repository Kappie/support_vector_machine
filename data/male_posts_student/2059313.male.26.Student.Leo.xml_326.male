A quick run down of the past few years of my life  [until this point]  would look like a lot of depression, hate, anger, hope, more depression, funks, crashes, loss, gain, more loss, and some good moments.  Starting in October of 2003, I became really involved with  urlLink Crossroads Christian Church .  There I re-learned what friendships and grace and compassion were, and that they do exist in more than just two people.  Thanks to a lot of people that I met there, I've learned a lot about myself, been given a lot of good advice, and am able to make it through my day without feeling like there's some impending doom around the corner just waiting for me to walk by so it can beat the crap out of me. Stephanie, my ever-faithful, beautiful, and loving friend has seen it all, and helped me through most of it.  Some of the folks from Crossroads that took me in or taught me some well needed lessons about life were some of the same people that I know read this blog.  For one, Patrick.  Thanks man, and sorry for the crap I pulled... I am an ass.  Aside from those two... Dave, Jon, Matt, Eric, and Ira have all been really awesome and helpful along the way.   Back to the story... EKU Theatre was a big part of all this crap... not the department, or the professors, or the classes, but the students.  Negative, negative, mean, bitter people. I started working this past week at the theatre for financial aid... federal work study.  It's great, I get paid for doing what I enjoy doing.  I haven't talked with many people around the theatre except the technical professor (my "boss").  I get a unique view of things going on in the actual theatre space while people are working because I'm 35 (or more) feet in the air above their heads on the catwalks working on the lights.  Nothing has changed... no body has any degree of a work ethic... people just goof off and flirt (I'm all about flirting, but if it keeps the job from getting done or people being ANY amount of productive, it's too much.  It makes me laugh SO much to think that I used to really care what a lot of those people thought about me.  I'm very glad I'm not in rehearsals with them, or in classes with them.  I'm very excited at how my life has changed, how much I feel I've grown.  I love my friends.  I love my life.  I love my God.  Because through my friends and through me, he has made everything possible.  And there's a piece of me that anytime I see some of the people there, I think... I've done this "out there", I know I can make it, will you ever make it?  And a small part of me hopes not... a bigger part of me feels sad knowing that most of them won't.
