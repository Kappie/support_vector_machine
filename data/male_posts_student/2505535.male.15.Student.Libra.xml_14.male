And today, I went to Croydon with Amy, Ben and Anna, it was cool, I bought, Fantomas - Delerium Cordia (which is really good, I'm listening to it now) and Dream Theatre.. can't remember the name of the album, but the songs are really good.  Alot of people are at the Cartoon, seeing Felix XIII and some other band - so no-one's online, partly why I'm finding the time to update this. Delerium Cordia is suprisingly good, I recomend it.. I think I need something to eat now.. pizza hut wasn't enough, and a cup of tea...
