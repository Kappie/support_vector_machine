However, I have not yet decided if I am going to pursue it.  Am I mature enough to be involved in a relationship?  Can I acurately judge my own maturity?  Is she mature enough to enter a relationship?  Should I enter a relationship so close to leaving for college?  What does God want?  Life is so confusing.
