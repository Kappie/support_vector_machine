I texted her later on to ask if she was coming out at all today, but she said she was 'with Emma'. Emma is her lesbian friend...but I'll probably write about that in a future entry. Anyway, eventually she rang, and she seemed really quiet... I asked her what was wrong and I knew something was wrong, but she said no, although it was reluctant. Then I heard a deep male voice. It was Jeremy. I asked her if it was, and she said yes, so I just said 'Gotta go, bye' and hung up. I then sent her a text saying 'If you were going out with Jeremy today you should've just said...instead of making excuses. It's your decision who you see'. She sent one back saying 'I know....it was wrong but I didn't want you two (me and paul) to have a go at me. I'll talk to you about it tomorrow. x.'. So I sent one back saying.... 'I wouldn't of had a go. I would've been disapointed but I wouldn't of had a go at you. At the end of the day it's your choice who you go out with, not mine and Paul's.'  Yesterday we did nothing but say how wrong he was for her, so we obviously pissed her off, but still, was there any need to lie about what she was doing. I'm really sad that she'd rather spend time with a druggie than me and Paul, who she claims to be best friends with.  :(      Jack
