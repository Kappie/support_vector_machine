As I watched, and later read, President Bush's speech  on this unfortunate event, I could only shake my head. Why? In all  my years, I have never seen such a terrible instance of misunderstanding.  I know this best from my father. Sadly, my father and I have a bad  relationship. Seldom a day passes now without my father and I getting into  an argument. This could be easily avoided if my father and I worked harder  to understand each others' point of view. In light of recent events of  insurgency and anti-Americanism throughout the world, I must point out something  obvious, yet true: everything is a matter of perspective. Whether it  be the color of an object, the weather, religious differences, or the war on  terror, it's easily a matter of perspective. For example, I recently  discovered  http://english.aljazeera.net .  While I do not agree with all their reporting, it's definitely insightful as to  understanding what really irks most Muslims and Arabs about Americans:  vigilantism. So maybe Bush Administration officials wll follow these steps  to ease tensions immediately:          Remove all American contractors from the Arab world. This is a    necessary first step towards protecting our citizens abroad. While this    will hurt some corporations in our country, this will serve three    purposes: getting our people out of danger, letting tensions cool, and,    in Iraq, giving Iraqis jobs to stem the 40% unemployment rate.     Give full soverignty to the interim Iraqi government. I admit, the    United States appears to be giving a good job of this, but heed my    warning: anything that makes Americans look like occupiers will give    ammunition to radical Islamics to keep hurting any Americans that are in the    Arab world.     Stop talking about this war in terms of "good" and "evil". Indeed,    this can be really tempting at some times, such as the recent beheading, but    the fact of the matter is that these ideas are relative; therefore, it can    make perfect sense to them to call us evil, which they do.     Most importantly, find out what makes certain Islamics declare America    evil. I have my theories, and you may have yours (and would probably    make a good topic for next week's column), but the most important step in    resolving any conflict is understanding why the other party feels how they    do. For al-Qaeda, the chances of this happening could very well be slim    to nil, but there are many other respectable Islamic clerics in the world, and    it is imperative to understand just what makes us the enemy.    These steps are only a beginning, but in order to finish any journey, you  must take the first step. I can only hope that America does soon, lest  this turbulence consumes us all.
