Just a few minutes ago I did one of the dumbest things.  At a stop sign I look, see a car coming and just I start going. My parents started yelling and I stopped.  If I kept going I'd be screwed right now.  I must have thought the other Things like this keep happening and its making me question whether or not I should continue driving.  But, what I need to do is just go on and learn from my mistakes, because I am sure that I am learning from them.  But enough of that crap...  I ended up seeing Dodgeball today, and it was really good.  I though I wasn't going to though, but after a lot of stuff happening I did.  First I thought Mike wasn't going because he didn't wanna spend the money, but then I get on this morning and he says he's going.  So when Luke came online Mike asked him if he was going but he just said he couldn't go and logged off real fast...  I don't know what going on with him right now, because he started acting really strange last night, and then the weird responses this morning...  Well, Mike was going to the movie anyway so I decided I would go cuz I didn't know what's going on with Luke.  If he's pissed that we went it's not my problem.  After the movie I just went back to Mike's and we played Soul caliber for a really long time.  I mostly got my but kicked...  And now that brings me back to now, so I'm done.  later...
