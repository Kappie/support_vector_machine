So that night was really nice even though most of it was spent watching the TV and erm... other stuff. I went home on Thursday morning and ended up coming back that night! I wasn't meant to stay but I went to wait for a bus and ended up waiting about 2 hours in the freezing cold and rain for nothing. But Mandy (being the amazing andbeautifulgirlfriend she is!) bought us chips and gravy (mmmmmm) but even though they made me feel sick they were nicccceeee! So we had no choice to go back to Mandy's. I did offer to walk home so many times but Mandy wouldn't let me! Mandy's mum wasn't happy... I hid in the kitchen while they were arguing in the front room! So she got her ass grounded! Great! (Sarcasm).I suppose it's my fault though. So I won't see her for ages now. Yesterday though, I went to meet her outside of college so I could see her for at least a little while and that was really nice I think. We had Happy Meals! No wait... she did. Like I'd eat a Happy Meal?!... lalala. And we spent ages watching people stand in a dead bird on the road, t'was so funny! Anyway, I am tired still, my sisters crappy dance music woke me up and I have no plans for today... maybe I will go into town and see some friends I haven't seen in a while.
