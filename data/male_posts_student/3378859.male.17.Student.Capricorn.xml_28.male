We're going to end up having to solve a murder using DNA testing, Hair testing, blood typing etc. etc.  Hopefully we'll end up  getting the right murderer...and then our local police will come in and take care of the arrest and everything...we're going all out...even though the murder is completely fake and all the dna etc. is supplied by VT.  look for a story about it in the Daily Press.
