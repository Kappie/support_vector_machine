She is an amazing person, but unfortunately, no matter how many times I tell her that, and reassure her of it, one person can come along and in one swift motion make her doubt most everything about herself.  I love my friendship with her, because even as I help her, she (unknowingly, more than likely) is helping me along the way.  Experience is a great teacher, but there are somethings that I'd rather learn from others experiences, and so I look to my friends, especially this one, and ask questions and just observe her in life.  If I could, I would totally and completely learn everything for myself and go through the pain if it meant that she wouldn't have to. She is kind, honest, caring, funny, beautiful, intelligent, compassionate, and loving.  I love her.  She is my sister.  She is inspiration.  She is an asset.  She is my confidant.  And she is my best friend.  I wouldn't want to be walking through life without her right now... or ever.  I thank God for the great gift of her presence in my life... and through her I can see Him working in so many glorious ways.  God is an amazing sculptor of my life... and thankfully he put us somewhere in the kiln together.    I never want to be without her friendship.
