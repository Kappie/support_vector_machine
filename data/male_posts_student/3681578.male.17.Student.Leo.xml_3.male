I mean, yeah, I know calculus alright pero the proving is just a shave to hard/confusing for me...  Well, I did prepare for last night and I do hope I go along fine...   Anyway, I haven't finished the 18-page reading for Filipino...oh shucks, its a LOT of poems...really...and its too damn boring for me...  And later I have homework for lit and english...hmmm...And I'm actually hungry but can't eat because of math...
