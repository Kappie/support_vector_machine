It was lots of fun in that it seemed like everyone there knew someon that knew someone. That made for good coversation and fun.  There was some crazy shit across the street though. There was a party across the street... loud music, the smell of weed, drunk kids... that's right kids! Actually that's not that crazy unless you take into the account that the parents were there hosting all of it. It's crazy that the parents let the kids get stoned and drunk. I mean the birthday girl was messed up!  ***
