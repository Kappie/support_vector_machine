Then we went to tomz crib and ate some food (his food is awesome...no doubt)...then it was time to unleash the fury on those camarillo scorpz...we lost the first game 21-25, cuz we were kinda nervous and wasnt intense throughout the game. The 2nd game was close the whole way, it was jus back in forth, damn im such a good actor...haha cuz we won 28-26 and i touched the ball on a block and i quickly said no touch to the ref...got em.
