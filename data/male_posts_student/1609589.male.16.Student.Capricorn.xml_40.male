I guess i found the reason I've been depressed all these years... Texas.... dammit! Oh well, another 3-5 years here, and that's it. Now that I know there are better places out there to live, where i don't have to live with the endless torment of christian shitholes that have nothing better to do with their time than make me miserable. Sorry, christian friends, but i just hate religion, and you all are gonna have to get the hell over it.  ALWAYS REMEMBER- HITLER WAS A CATHOLIC."  --I hate to break it down into religion like this, but really, thats what it turns into.   But enough about me. What about you? How do you feel that the whole world is run by an inescapable sense of insecurity?  Write a letter to your favorite christian-supporting politions(Let's say... oh.... George Dubya) and either tell him to:  1. Lead on, you are a great president and I wish that some day i could be as great as you! (*cough ASSHOLE *cough*) --or-- 2. You lying pretzel-choking piece of crap! Why the hell are you screwing our country over like this? You can shove that cross right up your ass for all I care!  Those of you who picked number two should be eligible for some kind of award. I should make my own. The Snider award. That'll show em. Give people an award for being different.  Speaking of being different, that brings me to another topic. a Hot Topic.  What was the person who created the Hot Topic chain of stores thinking? What he/she did was make being punk not creative anymore. I think Keith from the webcomic Mall Monkeys said it best:  "Hot Topic is a store that attempts to be a "Hot Topic" by being controversial. But, it's a business. They sell weird clothes and jewelry. They have a small selection of cds. Hot Topic removed the fun out of "being different". When kids no longer had to make their own spiked jewelry out of dog collars and such, a new generation of half-assed "freaks", hardcore kids, goths, and mainstream punks showed up. Ever since, Hot Topic, to me at least, has been the hangout for rich trendy kids. They're just as bad as the kids who shop only at Abercrombie and Fitch."  So it degenerates into the fact that the kids who are being "different" end up being the same.  I think Hawaiian shirts and Cargo pants work for me for now.  I can't believe i had all this to say at midnight.   Thank you all who read all this ranting of mine- the reason i have this journal is for my voice to be heard, and you are a huge step in that direction.
