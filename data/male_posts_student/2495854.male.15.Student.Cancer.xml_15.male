FINALLY! i kicked me feet up and hoped for all a's! THE BEST WEEK EVER WAS WAY FUNNY! and nathalie and i had our own i love the 80's marathon!   on saturday i was working hard on my abortion report when nathalie called me and told me to come with her to the mall.. so i met her there and some weird guy was talking to her and it was creepy.. well we walked around and then i called jack and told him i was at the mall! and he said he was there toooo! so nathalie and i walked around and we ran into him at american eagle but he couldnt talk to us cause he was with someone "cooler". nathalie and i went to radio shack and looked at the picture phones and then we JAYE-walked across the street to longs where we asked the lady to call jaye cerruti to the front. so he came. and i bought the april teen people and some gum and we walked over to mcdonalds. i gave him a HUGE hug and then i went inside and we had MUGGETS! did ya noe those things are made with white meat!? i didnt... AND THEN WE GOT THIS TOY IN THE HAPPY MEAL AND IT WAS A SOCCER PLAYER!! ;-)  well we walked back to the mall and met up with jack and then him an di hung out while nathalie wandered around gottchalks.. it was nice :-) . then nathalie came back and we ate fries and i went crazy with the salt _like always_ and yeah.. well she left and jack and i decided to walk around the mall some more and then go to his car.. and then we saw nathalie outside and she came in with us. it was alotta fun! nathalie was the dj and jack and i sat in the back talking.. then nathalies mom came.. and my dad came.. so we left.. but overall it was a good day.   sunday.. i slept. and then finished my notes for history. oh, and didnt we have french homework?   monday was cool. the weekend left me in a good mood.. and um.. we didnt have to run the mile, so that was good.. didnt we play badminton again!? i dunno.. i think i just slept.. oh and we got our grades for math and mine was an 89.1 % because i missed so much school!? what the fuck!? well to mcconnell, attendence is 30% of the grade. freak. i missed shonick and french though, i left school at lunch to get my braces tightened and my bands changed, although... they didnt really hurt after.. maybe it's cause they didn't give me a steel wire... well yeah!   so um.. tuesday! in english we watched the FUNNIEST les mis. movie!! this lady like fell down! oh and i started bring 6 bottles of water to school everyday so that i would be hydrated.. mmm water.. in shonick we reviewed for the test. and the britney concert was that night! jack and nelli went.. and other people.. yeah.. i'll wait til she comes this summer.

SO FUN!   we got hit by that handicapped door going back into macy's and we saw carolyn there! well then we met up with christina, got some fries, saw mr. michael grass who REALLY needs to cut his hair. oh we saw cassondra too.. then nathalie bought this shirt from expressions and there was this really coool music video playing! i like died! it was the best.. well christina left after we all gave her a big hug and then nathalie's mom drove me and crystal home in the COOLEST CAR! I SWEAR!! the handles to open the doors are WAY COOL! its like a *LIMO!*!! haha.. so then i went home and talked to dominic while rocking out to I LOVE THE 80's STRIKES BACK!   friday was less eventful, we did hurdles in pe and mrs. locke was a maniac.
