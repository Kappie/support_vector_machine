I hardly did anything after that, most of the day was spent on the phone or sleeping. I went to McGrady's last night. I drank two beers and left by 12:30. Decent crowd. Saw Angelo, Joe Ward, Jen Fischer, and came with Seth.   Today I am going to work around the house. Dani should be stopping by later. Not much else going on. No craziness last night, just a relaxing night. Andy called me, he's back from Japan. I guess he is finally going to dump Jackie. So he says... She was crying because he hasn't seen her yet, instead he is spending time with Liz, his new fling. I was with him when he met her at Finnegans (she's the whole blow job, hiking, weird old man story). I can't wait to see him.   This weekend I have Army crap to do... Not really looking forward to that, but whatever. Sgt. Toth is trying to set up an interview with a Special Forces unit in Maryland. I will have to do ANOTHER indocrination if I want to try out. That means one month of training, yuck!   Four weeks left here, and one down south. Time is going so fast.
