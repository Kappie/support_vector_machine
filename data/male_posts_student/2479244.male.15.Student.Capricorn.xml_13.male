This is nothing that is widely mainstream public. This is not a person, a place, or a thing. It is something beyond anything that exists, because it is the force that encourages, ends, prolongs, and even destroys existence.  I myself have never believed in such a thing as God, and to be honest, I don't think I ever could. The idea is so farfetched and unproven to me that I simply cannot see the logic behind the existence of such a creature. However, I will not deny that I can see unexplainable patterns and forces in things that many professionals explain simply as "nature." Well, potentially, nature is a very broad topic. It could be anything from the elements, to natural selection, even to chemical reactions.   I always look at things like trees, for example, and I wonder how such an elaborate, yet unique bark pattern forms on the tree. No two trees are exactly identical, but they all have a common look about them. That is to say all bark will have a similar base, but not similar detail. Okay, I've always understood this. This was not a concept that was beyond my grasp. But what is, and is to everyone, is how bark decides to patternize itself. Why does it suddenly decide to jut to the right at this part? Why will it split at this part? For what reason will it make a loop here? Why is this ridge straight? If I were to give you a simple answer for this, I would tell you that it is the Will of Nature.  Now, I don't want you to starting e-mailing me questions about "What does Nature look like? How does it choose? Will it talk to me? Can I talk to it? Does it control me?" The fact of the matter is that I have no damn clue, but this is simply observation and speculation, none of which should be interpreted as bare-bone truth.  With that aside, I would look to make some opinions on what I believe Nature to be. Nature, unlike the ever-so-popular concept of God, does not take form as a single entity, and it is not possible. Nature is not a tree, a forest, or a continent. It is not a leg, an ant, a person, or a community. It is nothing that exists on Earth that is tangible. The only thing that I believe Nature to be is an abstract concept and force behind everything that exists. The difference between "tree nature" and "abstract nature" is that abstract nature does not, as I said before, come in any tangible form. It simply influences everything.  Now, I'm sure you're all brewing up thousands of inconsistencies about my theories in your head to prove to me why I am wrong and your Bible, or whatever for that matter, is correct. To be honest, I am not surprised that there are inconsistencies and unanswered questions. Nature is not a simple concept. Nature is not a concept that can be grasped by my mind, or any mind. It is something so far beyond us that we will never understand why it chooses to do what it does. By that, do I mean that it is intelligent? To some degree, yes, I do. I believe Nature makes choices in order for the universe, as we know it, to chain together.   Why do I believe this? Well, scientists have often said that there is such a tiny chance for life to spark on a planet, that we are an extremely lucky world. They say that many planets potentially hold all the recipes for life, but some simply do not pull through. This is why Nature is an inconsistent, unexplainable concept. It does and it does not. It chooses what will exist and what will not, but not always why. Everything I can explain about it will simply be open-ended, illogical phrases, but that is all that I can put it as, from my own point of view. I see it as a non-tangible, intelligent, choice-making force that will do as it sees fit for whatever reason it sees fit.  That is to say... imagine you have a rectangle of empty circles. It is 400 circles high and 10,000 circles long. You are to choose, for whatever reason you deem necessary, which circles will be filled in black, and which circles will not. Sometimes nature will choose a pattern that will repeat, sometimes it will choose a method of chaos. Sometimes it will choose a placement that suits the rectangle to fit in with its environment, and sometimes it will choose a placement that distinguishes it from all others. However, unlike you and I, it seems as if, for the most part, Nature is constantly aware of the ramifications of the placements, and the possibilities and advantages of other types. That is to say, it will not make a polar bear blood-red when it lives in a white environment. That is also to say that if a fish, at some point or another, were to require the ability to walk on land, Nature would see this need as necessary or not necessary.   However, many people will not be satisfied by that. Why will only some fish sprout legs, but others will simply remain as fish? This is one thing I cannot even lend human logic to. Nature will decide what it decides, and we are all under its influence. Just because a human will see it fit in their minds that wings are necessary, Nature will not always deem it so. It will choose as it needs and it will need what is fit.  One thought that comes to my mind is - what did Nature just spring up from? Has it always existed? Was it some how created? If so, what by? Why? The one flaw (or perhaps greatest design) that Nature has put in humans is the insatiable desire for an answer. Humans will not be satisfied by answers like "because" or "it is the truth." A human being requires logic behind rules, and without logic, they can easily dismiss the subject.  And that is why so many people will disagree with me that Nature is the force behind existence. But that, for one reason or another, is just what it wants us to do.
