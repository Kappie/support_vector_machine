After a summer long of Blogging, Yearbook Camping, Driver's Ed-ing, and wasting time in New York-ing, I think I'm ready to get back this year.  My schedule, like I've noted in the past, is not hard at all, and should actually be pretty easy.  My brother is going to be around, and just his presence is going to ruin me, but, after the first couple of days, I think it'll be alright.  We have to at least try to get along like most high school siblings, and though I doubt its going to happen, it's worth a shot.   At long last, I'm finally NOT riding the bus. For the past three years I've had to deal with that kind of torment, and its just not fun.  So I found a ride until October, when I get my license.  My good friend Melinda is going to take me.   Pre-school preparations are completed, and I am all set to go for tomorrow.  So why aren't I at Busch Gardens, like originally planned?  I don't feel like it.  So I'm just going to stay here, and go next weekend.  I'd rather go to Universal, but, that's not for a while.  So today, I'm just gonna chill around here, play Top Spin, maybe win another tournament in that game, then, I'm going to probably watch a couple DVDs, and then, I'm going to go to sleep, wake up at 6:30 tomorrow morning, and begin the 2004-2005 school year without being too tired.  I'm already used to getting up early, since I've been at school almost every day last week, so, it shouldn't be too much of a bad thing getting up to start in the morning.   So, about this Gmail contest.  I STILL do not have my invites, and it's kinda ticking me off a bit.  They said about 2-4 weeks after you sign up, and its now been six.  I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, they're going to be launching the final version soon.  But, we'll see.  If I don't have anything by the end of the month, I'll just call the whole thing off.   That's it for now.  I'm going to go get my laundry going, and then I'm going to play Top Spin for an hour or so.  So, be sure to check out Blog of Bagel later for more crap for you to spend time reading.  David out.  Later.
