In fact, I was one of the first people to buy this game, I got it on the day it was released, mostly because of its high quality parentage, Rockstar Games, those responsible for GTA, it is an incredibly good game and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but now fewer people can. Now, everyone thinks that the teenage killer was copying the game, and I’m not going to deny it, in fact it the details sound so much like the game that I’m almost certain that is what he was doing, but does that mean that the majority of people should no longer be able to enjoy it, I’m not one of those people that say games never affect anyone, but there’s maybe one in a billion people that actually acts based on these violent games, for the rest of us, the thought never enters our heads. I think this is really stupid of Dixons, its nothing more than a blatant attempt to win some kudos from the poor delusioned parents desperate to blame something for the fact that their son was essentially just the one weak guy in a sea of stronger people. The very people that now suffer because of it.  urlLink http://www.rockstargames.com/manhunt/
