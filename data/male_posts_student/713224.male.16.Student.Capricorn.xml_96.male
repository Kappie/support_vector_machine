The way they tell the different stories from different times and make them so cohessive that it seems like someone dipped the screenplay into a vat of rubber cement. There isn't much I can say on the down side other than that it didn't leave me all that entertained, but I didn't feel like watching it was a waste of time, in fact, I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good mystery/drama. In the end I give it:    ****  *
