To wit, some new(er) friends have recently discovered the band Massive Attack.  For those of you out there who are not familiar with this band, they are what was happening in the club scene in Manchester, UK when grunge was (supposedly?) happening in Seattle.  Because of this, few Americans were ever given the opportunity to hear their music because corporate America music decided we needed to hear some angst-ridden heroin addicts deride the evils of corporate American music.  In a voice that echoes the '90s, "How con ven ient."  Who would argue?  They sold millions of discs.  But time flies and few of my friends, if any, still listen to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees, Alice in Chains, etc.  The grunge thing just doesn't sell 10 years later.  But Massive Attack does.  They are a seminal "studio band" that learned early on that the sound is more important that the band.  With this philosophy, they cycled in lead singer after lead singer.  They embraced reggae, dub, gothic, r, soul, gospel one and all.  Whatever worked.  Tracey Thorne (Everything But the Girl), Sinead O'Connor, Elisabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins), Nicolette, etc.,  all took their turns at fronting this chameleon band.  They even spawned their own brand of music:  trip hop arose out of band member Tricky's mumbled, soulful, bizarre poetics.  Today's project was making a Massive Attack greatest hits CD.  I love a challenge, especially when I get to toss back a few brews and burn a CD that I hope a good friend will get years of enjoyment from.  Not easy when it comes to Massive Attack.  They started out r, moved onto beautiful pop/trip hop melodies, graduated to haunting reggae/goth grooves and are now somewhere in the ether with Sinead O'Connor.  I arrived at the following:  Angel, from the Mezzanine CD What Your Soul Sings, 100th Window Be Thankful, Blue Lines Protection, Protection Karmacoma, Protection Three, Protection Safe From Harm, Blue Lines Sly, Protection Heat Miser, Protection Teardrop, Mezzanine Unfinished Symphony, Blue Lines  This list is heavy w/cuts from  Protection   BUT  if I were to choose their best, I'd go w/ Mezzanine .  This is just my wild ass theory but I imagine that the title comes from that in-between space between the reggae groove and the gothic/dark space that is cultivated by Massive Attack on this CD.  Don't believe you can be reggae and goth at the same time?  Buy the CD.  You won't be sorry.
