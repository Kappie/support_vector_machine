But still some of us think human have choice in their life. Frankly I am one of those people who think we have choice of our life, but in another way. I mean I divided whole decision things in to some  different levels or categories  such as  Less Important decisions or High Important decisions . Human right is to choose somewhere in the middle of this imaginary diagram. Although what did happen to the Less and High Important things.   First  Less Important : these things are done by system itself, like autopilot. Interesting isn’t it. It doesn’t matter who you are, depending on your situation system decide something happen to you, like you accidentally fall in the middle of a lovely walk without any reason, it don’t hurt you and may make others laugh but it happened for reason which you don’t know it and it wasn’t your choice neither.  Second  High Important : let’s talk about these later; remember to think about it, what things would be high important decision which is not you choice?
