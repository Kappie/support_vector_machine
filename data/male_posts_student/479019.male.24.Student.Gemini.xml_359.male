It's kind of comic book style... with a narrative.   I'm not really satisfied with myself right now... because I've been a total lazy ass since coming back to school. 16 hours of sleep a day is so unproductive... my goal is to get my ass up early  every  morning now.   For my aural enjoyment right now.  Suicide Machines ' SOS.  ***
