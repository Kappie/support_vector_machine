I realize that it will more than likely be close friends of mine that read any of the content here, if they care to take the 30 seconds it takes to come and read one post. It is because of this, that I was forced to reconsider my original post, which has been deleted. Don't expect to see things in here that will be too revealing to my actual life. I'm going to try and make some changes to the site over the next few days, however, it may take longer than I would like, as I'm still getting used to HTML and there are many things that I don't know how to do yet. I have a lot of ideas, and I'm catching on quickly, so hopefully it won't take me too long to start producing. I'm going to be gone for 5 days this weekend, starting Thursday. I'll try and update the site via my cell phone, which I believe is possible. But I suppose only time will tell.  On another note, today was a good day. To my complete surprise, my English mark raised 4%. Believe me when I say that was a shock. It won't likely last long.
