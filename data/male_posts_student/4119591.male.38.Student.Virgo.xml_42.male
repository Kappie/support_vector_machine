But, hey, I'm being negative again and I previously said I wouldn't be so down on everything. Stuff blows up; lots of people die. Thousands of Agent Smiths cause trauma for Neo. If "more" is better, this film is great. Work it out for yourself.  On a more positive note... remember, I'm endeavoring to be more positive... Tania and I also went to see  Spider-Man 2  recently. If you're a fan of the comic (we are not comic fans) you might find it lacking, but if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one even better. It's campy, fun, and full of ambiguous characters (neither good or bad, rather a mix of both) just like real life.  And while I'm on the subject of films, I would also recommend  Twelve Angry Men  (1957) starring Henry Fonda. I watched it as part of a discussion topic for a social psychology class. The movie depicts an example of minority opinion having sway over a majority.
