It goes really random, from gardening to horse cock. i went to kels blog just now ( yes i read it mate ) and i see "teen porn" on the top. And when i take it away it keeps coming back on the next load. Sheet, ad aware helps, for a day. It keeps coming back. Yepp neeways its 11.20am in the morning on a MONDAY and im at home listening to dragonforce while others are in school. CLB rawks. Ah shit, my dad just called and he asked me to study, maybe i'll go to watch Shrek 2 later, anyone wants to go? lol :D~~ bored, go study le...ciao!
