If your thinking this could cause a problem, you're right. I only have a few blog entries to begin with, much less what'll happen if I delete the ones I already have.  I also decided to change the colors and add a picture at the top where my name is. I'm thinking that when I turned 13 on Sunday, something went hay-wire in my brain and now I'm trying to fix everything up. What's really strange is that I've cleaned out my contact list and updated birthdays, addresses, and phone numbers. To top that off I've gone in an downloaded a calender and have put the birthdays in with reminders and everything. I even added when school ends and crap!  I hope this doesn't last long, or else I might be cleaning my room up. And it's already clean as it is. I'm afraid I'll start dusting and never stop. Then you'll see 'Kid starts cleaning spree and hasn't stopped yet' on the New York Times, and I don't even live in New York!  Save me!!!!!!!
