Its really sad that I didnt go to sleep last night. I was tired at 10 but refused to close my eyes because a new episode of the dead zone was on. Then it was all down hill from there. I started o watch one of my favorite movies eva'  What about Bob  on Tv and then i got hungry. I made a chicken sandwitch. Then somehow it was 2 and the power went out for a few seconds and my grandpa's air machine went off (its kinda funny). It wouldnt stop beeping so i started pushing buttons and it turn back on, then i was afraid that i might have activated a reverse air process (a vacuum) and would accidently implode gramps so i check in on him...........he was ok. Lets see...... Oh me mum woke up and we just chilled about on the sunporch till like 5:30 watchin the rain and telling stories.   Last night I went and saw Napoleon Dynamite and it is completely halarious. It is so dorky that its great. I wouldnt mind seein' it again. OK so on Saterday i hung out with my seester and first we went and ate at  my big fat greek resturant  and cried about the homeless teenagers. After the nice sob we headed to the movies to see Anchorman. For the third time. This is the most i have ever seen a movie in theaters, I'll make a list in order of most most seen.  Anchorman-3 Spiderman-2 Jurassic Park2-2 Finding Nemo-2 (soon to be seen more than once) The Village Napoleon Dynamite Sky Cap'n and the World of Tomorrow  And i do believe that is it. Lets see............. Im going to do my own version of  Vh1's best week ever's buzz saw................................................................................      This week on BUZZ SAW      Katherine Gilstrap proves that manners fade with age as an over drugged Eldery women gives her the snap in her own hood.
