It's funny, when we moved into this house in 1996... we knew that there were cat5 cables built into the walls and a hub in the closet of the master bedroom. We haven't taken advantage of it until now, we even had a cable modem for a few years as well. I guess it was a bitch to go from room to room and figure out which cable went to which jack. It took me about 2 hrs to do that on Sunday afternoon. Anyway, so  urlLink Stan  and I spent the afternoon doing that.  After that, I more or less went to go and hang out with  urlLink Crystal . We went to various places so I could check out frames for my diplomas, and then we ate at El Cholo. It was funny, because we got there just as the manager was locking the front doors at 9. He let us in though. Our waitress was a bit frustrated that we were let in, and she didn't hide it. She wasn't overtly rude, but it was obvious they wanted us out of there.  Anyway so I woke up this morning around 6:30 AM and went for a 2 mile run. I haven't done that particular route since high school (when I was cutting weight). I started feeling nauseous when I was on Meadowwood though. Afterwards, I did some light lifting, made breakfast for my dad and Stan, and watched  The Rundown .  I feel productive as of late, but alas the productivity isn't directed toward things I feel are important... things such as reading, writing and possibly artwork. I'm going to go to the grocery store a bit later and probably pick up frames for my diplomas. I'm going to  try  to finish that Amin and Thrift book today.  ***
