In fact I am having such a great time that very few things bother me nowadays.  So much so that when the person that I had tried so hard to forget is making a comeback in my life and it is not bothering me. Maybe its because that this person was one day my biggest strength, and today she is my biggest weakness. A person whom I couldn't stay without seeing for a day, today I can't stand to meet her. Maybe its because I have changed a lot.  Maybe its as much my fault as her that it didn't work out. A relationship which lasts 7 years and then never ends .... is as much my fault as hers. Maybe if I had tried a bit more.... maybe... But I will have to spend my life saying " Maybe......  Apart from that, and the fact that I was able to take this unexpected bolt... Things are swell. Just had this mail from a cousin... who recieved it from a paramour... hope you people  like it.... I am sure all of you will feel that you can identify with it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end, Yet the days go by and weeks rush on, And before I know it, a year is gone. And I never see my old friends face, For life is a swift and terrible race, He knows I like him just as well, As in the days when I rang his bell. And he rang mine but we were younger then, And now we are busy, tired men. Tired of playing a foolish game, Tired of trying to make a name. "Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on Jim Just to show that I'm thinking of him." But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes, And distance between us grows and grows. Around the corner, yet miles away, "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today." And that's what we get and deserve in the end. Around the corner, a vanished friend. Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what They mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time it might be too late. Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
