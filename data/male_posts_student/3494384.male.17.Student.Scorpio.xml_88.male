Fancy us being the same age but he's like more mature than me and such. Hiaz... Childish me...  He told me about 'clicking' and such. He said: If you can click with a person means you can click le and if you cant, means you cant le.   Dont know why bahz... Aiyahz...  How dare later got test. Networking shit. I going to go in the room and flunk this test. How stupid. Cuz I didnt study. :P
