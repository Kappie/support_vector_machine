But this is a far cry from  urlLink Pak Adib's  blog. At his 100th post he already have 19514 visitors! COngratulations!  By the way, the  urlLink Great Malaysian Blog List  ( urlLink GMBL ) had also reached 1000 blogs with  urlLink Azra's  blog being the 1000th. As the news is displayed at main page of  urlLink GMBL  her number of visitors increased rapidly. Unfortunately her PC is down, so she can't make any new postings.  Hmm, the number of visitors from Singapore had surpassed those from United Kingdom. The link at  urlLink Ruqayyah's  page had been contagious with more of her friends put a link to both  urlLink Azra's  and my blog. Nevertheless it's a good developement but after this I have to resurrect  urlLink My Palm Guide  - number of visitors had dropped due to the lack of updates.   - Sound of  Bidadari  by  Rabbani  -
