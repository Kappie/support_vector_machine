I'm thinking maybe it doesn't.  But I liked the idea.  I don't know.  So if you read it, let me know if it works or not?  Thanks.

[clip from behind-the-scenes tour]  BRUCE BABBITT This is the Green Room, where they provide coffee or tea for the candidates, and give them a place to make final preparations before the debate begins.  Across the hall is the media room, where the candidates will make statements to the press after the debate is finished…  NARRATOR And, if you order now, we’ll throw in a limited-edition Joe Biden for President bumper sticker, and an autographed photo of Democratic Leadership Committee chairman Al From.
