Guess that's just more time before the inevitable. Well anyway...  Crapasscartoons is getting a facelift! We've moved to a new host for more flexibilty and no fuckin' banners. The link on the toolbar on the right'll still get you the old site b/c we haven't told the .tk router the new address. We've still got some work to do, which I hope to get done tomorrow, er..today, now that the SAT's've been postponed. I'll post again when we've got the site fixed up so that we can have a new cartoon there on a regular basis, along with other crap, mebbe.  That's all for news crap, uh lemme think....yeah...should be it...     The Offspring - Self Esteem   I wrote her off for the tenth time today, And practiced all the things I would say. But she came over, I lost my nerve. I took her back and made her dessert.  Now I know I'm being used, That's okay man cause I like the abuse. I know she's playing with me, That's okay 'cause I got no self esteem.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  We make plans to go out at night, I wait till 2 then I turn out the light. All this rejection's got me so low, If she keeps it up I just might tell her slow.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  (Chorus): When she's saying that she wants only me, Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends. When she's saying that I'm like a disease, Then I wonder how much more I can spend. Well I guess I should speak up for myself, But I really think it's better this way. The more you suffer, The more it shows you really care . Right? Yeah-hea-ea  Now I'll relate this little bit, That happens more than I'd like to admit. Late at night she knocks on my door, (She's) drunk again and looking to score.  Now I know I should say no, But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go. I may be dumb, But I'm not a dweeb. I'm just a sucker with no self esteem.  Oh way, oh yeah, yeah-eah oh yeah, yeah-ah, (x2)  (Chorus)    That's all for now, you bastards, I'm Deadinside, and I hate you, 'cept maybe in the way that I don't really...aw..man..how fuckin' feeble was that...I'm getting old...I can't find my joint medicine...  "OH NO!! ITS  TOO  HOT! PULL OUT, PULL  OUT! "
