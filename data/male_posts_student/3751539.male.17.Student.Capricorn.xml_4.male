I am passionate about archetypes.       2. What challenges do you face as a learner? How do you hope to respond to those challenges at BYU? How do you hope BYU will help you respond to those challenges?     I am easily distracted from learning. My course of learning also lacks direction and an end goal, which makes it easier to be sidetracked into less important things.       3. What sort of habits do you need to develop to become the sort of person that God wants you to become?    I need to become more efficient and waste less time. I also need to stop putting off working on my short and long term goals and love people more.      Obviously I have work to do. (Like finish answering the questions.)      When I attempted to answer the second question, at first I mentally replaced learner with student, which changes the question dramatically. I would have responded to the question by mentioning that I didn't really try in High School. Without working too hard I was able to do well. At college though, I intend to be relatively perfect. I intend to master the material and produce papers that are the archetypes of an excellent paper. I hope to find people who will work with me, but if I can't, I intend to work ahead anyway.    The BYU website states that, "We hope that these questions, in addition to giving us the opportunity to get acquainted, will help you spend some time in serious reflection on the significance of what you will do and become at BYU." I think they succeeded, because I did spend some time in serious reflection. I had thought a lot about what I want to accomplish at BYU, but before I wrote an answer I needed to come to terms with the question. I needed to mentally define passion, challenges, and habits, which was only semi-difficult. Passions are the things that I get excited about, challenges are the reasons why I might not learn as much as I should, and habits are actions that are repeated on a regular basis without conscious thought.   Now that I look back at the third question though, I realize that I did not really answer it.  (This would be a good time to go back and look at the third question.)  I   was supposed to answer with habits (repeated actions) I need to develop, so the verb in the answer should be the habit. Becoming more efficient is not the habit I want to develop. Being efficient is the habit I want to develop. Wasting less time is not the habit I want to develop. Not wasting time is the habit I want to develop.   Can "being" be a habit? Is it a series of repeated actions or is it just one action? If I somehow got the point across that I need to be efficient, stop being efficient, and then go back to being efficient, then "being" could be a series of repeated actions. I believe it is implied in my answer that it is just one action though, a constant state of "being", so that is yet another way I did not really answer the question. The same reasoning also applies to "not wasting"; it is implied that I need to constantly be "not wasting time". I guess I'll just have to rewrite my third answer.      As for the being passionate about archetypes, I just discovered that while thinking over what gets me excited. I do not fully understand it yet, so an explanation of that statement will have to wait for a later post.
