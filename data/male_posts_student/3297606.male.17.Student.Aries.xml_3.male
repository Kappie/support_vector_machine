Jerry was there, and when Jerry is ANYWHERE you know fun times are soon to come. man, i dont think ive laughed as much or as hard as i have this weekend in like one million years. i could sit here an write all the cool things that happened, but if you want details youll just have to talk to me in person. the bottom line was, this weekend was awsome.  there were like 9 ppl over today to continue the ping pong revolution, but we did more than ping pong, there was eating of pizza, there was watching of movies, there was filming of the camera, there was shooting of shotguns.... great stuff.  so im not going to school tomorrow, neither is tyler mike or jon.... welll mike MIGHT i dunno. but the reason for this is this: there was a threat of a shooting tomorrow! oh no! well thats really just our excuse for not going. there actually is a threat, but it doesnt really scare anyone, its just a great excuse to stay home. if there WAS a ashooting i would be kinda disappointed that i missed it. hopefully the gunfight conitunes down willow street liek a parade so i can watch from my front window. that would be good. they need to do that sometime. yea.  i think people should start doing arranged marriages again, then i wouldnt need to worry about this stupid EMO CRAP! dang it. yea i said im getting over it but what i really meant was its just loosening up.... i dont know if its possible to get over it. anyway im not going any further in depth because i would rather think about HAPPY THINGS like mike dancing in a dress of flowers!  have i done John Hansen yet? well if i have then im doing him again, hes just that cool...  John Hansen - COOL COOL COOL. he just started REALLY hanging out with us (us being mainly mike and i) and i never realized how awsome to the max he was. i always knew he was an intensly cool guy, but now i know, he is like a good template. His hair is crazy awsome, yea it is. John is like a parchment of gold... think about it for a while and then youll understand.   current good movie: paycheck current song you need to herar right now: seether - broken (featuring amy lee)
