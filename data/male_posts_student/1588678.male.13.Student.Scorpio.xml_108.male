Oh man, this film had thrilling and bone-chilling scenes-creepy-ass costumes-and the Oscar-winning Adrien Brody playing your typical village-idiot! I mean, how awesome is that?!  Okay, I wish I could share a lot with you, but it's hard cuz I'd have to give away lots of good information about it, and that'd suck. So, I'll keep it zipped.  You gotta see this movie. It's so great! I mean, if you've liked Shyamalan's previous movies, you'll love this one! And a lot of people I've talked to said that they didn't get the ending. If you pay attention and aren't high on cocaine, you'll get it! I did! If you see it, drop off a comment with your thoughts on the movie.   Well, see ya for now. Go see The Village. It's worth the stupid 7 bucks you (unfortunately) have to pay  . . . Such bullshit!
