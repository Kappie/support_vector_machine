I have always wondered what that small moving light was in the sky or that weird little man in my dreams who kept telling me to look in the sky at midnight on the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the 3rd year, well guess what?  I missed it, yes I did not look at the sky last year on March third, but then I wonder.  What if the weird little man meant the 3rd day after I saw him and then the third month after I saw him and then the third year, but who knows.  He might be talking about the third day after I realized that there were others and that on the third month or you know it might be the third day after I get stoned and see him again...hah hah I am just joking with you...he was a tall man.
