This does not mean, however, that you now need 3-5 servings of french fries as the food pyramid would suggest.  Rather, the classification is actually for commercial reasons only.  So why would I even post this mundane story?  Because the Agriculture Department said that it does not consider an order of french fries the same as an apple in school lunches.  Okay, so my only reason for posting this story is this:  Does the Agriculture Department actually think that an apple is a fresh vegetable?
