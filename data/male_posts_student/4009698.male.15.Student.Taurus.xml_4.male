At the board meeting, the likes of Dermott Brereton and Jason Dunstall along with club president Ian Dicker, decided that the club need a new figurehead.  "The board felt it was in the best interest of the club to establish a playing and coaching staff that will be part of that long term strategy." Dicker said.   Schwab, in the pre-season, was ambitious of winning the flag. Pity that the opposite has happened...  Does this mean that Schwab will be one of many cuts to Hawthorn? I only see one cut needed, and that's who's directing the club.  With that said, I put it to you now to voice your opinions. Tell me what you think...
