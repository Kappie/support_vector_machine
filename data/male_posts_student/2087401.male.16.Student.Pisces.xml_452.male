Paul would like to note that his computer was most likely designed to to torment his imortal soul.  He relishes the idea of climbing on his roof and throwing his computer in the air and shooting it with a shotgun or other projectile weapon.  But, if he did that he would have no computer, plus climbing on top of his house with a computer over his back is too strenuous for Paul.  Anyway, I am glad to be in the blog to rant about my plans for world domination and Paul's titanic struggle with his neighbor's cat.
