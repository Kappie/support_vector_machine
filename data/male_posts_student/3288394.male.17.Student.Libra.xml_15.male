My hackerphobicmom just bought Norton Internet Security and it's slowing down the comp like a.. like a... grrr! stupid non-functioning brain! I can't think of a non-profaneword to put there! Anyway, I don't like it. We already had Antivirus 2003 which was fine, but  noooooo - we needed something  newer . It freaking won't let me use MSN messenger or Trillian! It blocks internet radio and who know what else but I can't figure out this stupiduselessproxy junk!  I'm not in a good mood right now, can you tell??  My job is slaughtering my social life and wiping it'snose on it's corpse! I hate it but I need the money, which suddenly has so many drains on it! Grrr! I want to save for a paintball gun, a computer, camp, Magic cards, and for parts for my car! It's gonna be at least $230 for the gun and the accessories, at least $500 for the computer even if the guy I know gets the best deals, about $150 per part i need for my car, $63 for the Magic cardsI want, $350 for camp and I only get about $300-$400 a week! I know I shouldn't be complaining with that kind of paycheck, butmy jobsucks- I have at least 6 different bosses that don't know how to communicate with each other and I work more than full-time! I'm at work from 7:30 in the morning until anywhere from 4:30 to 6:00 at night on weekdays and from 7:30 to 1:00 every other Saturday. My friends call me less thanusual because they know I'm almost never available and they hardly ever call me anyways! I wish there was some non-brain-damaging/non-stupid/non-drug-relatedway to turn my brainoff and forget about all this crap I have weighing me down. I need a really really good friend who understands me. No offense, but none of you guys out there right now are doing much for me. Except maybe J-Fresh. Man, I never get to hang with you! I need something, and I need it bad. But first I need to know what it  is .
