It's deffinitley no  urlLink PoP , but it still stacks up well.  I would like to know what mario would do if he came into battle against the prince, mario wouldn't have much of a chance, not being able to control time and whatnot, but if our favorite plumber were to pull out a star, that would be a whole nother story.  however, annoying little fara wouldn't stand much of a chance against  urlLink peach  (umbrella slap).
