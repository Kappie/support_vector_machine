I guess one of the reasons that I stayed there so long is because of my bosses. Scott and Venee (my bosses) own the restaurant. While they were my bosses, they were much more to me than that. I truly love them and think of them as close to my real family as anyone can be. Over the years, they have done so much for me that I don't know how I will ever be able to repay them for it. I will hopefully keep in touch with them as my life goes on.  Related to my last days at Blimpies. This week, one of the regular customers who seems just to come in to see Cindy and me. (Well, since Cindy was not there this summer it was more just like me this summer) Anyway, she came in to say good-bye to me this week. She stayed there and talked to me for a little while. She told me that I was one of the great people out there and that she was going to miss me. She also told me that she hoped I had a good life. It was a really nice thing for her to do and I really needed to hear those things right now. Before she left, she asked for a hug, which I also needed during this time as well. I am really going to miss her and all of the other regular customers at Blimpies. I pray that their lives are filled with happiness.  It is sad to think that I probably won't be going back to Blimpies to work ever again. I am really going to miss talking to Scott and Venee. Their stories were always interesting and funny. They always cared for me and did a lot for me. And their personalities and love helped brighten up my days no matter how down of a mood I was in at the time. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank them for that.  Well, it is getting late so I must go to bed now. Tomorrow, I head back to Laramie. I start law school next Thursday and have a lot to do before that day comes.
