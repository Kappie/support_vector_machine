Reading "This Present Darkness" by Frank Peretti, really good book. Aiee, gotta get dressed, eat lunch, I just spent fifteen minutes on hold on the phone trying to get a hold of Jessica to see if she could work for me, but she can't so I'm gonna have to take Shannon up on his offer, wish I didn't have to, he's only a trainee, but he said he would if I couldn't find anyone else, and since three other people are out of town this week, it was only him and Jessica that could possibly cover for me. Food time, I'm shutting up now.
