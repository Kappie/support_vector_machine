The new Iraqi President doesn't want to turn this symbol of Saddam's repressive regime into ashes because he says it cost 100 million dollars and Iraq needs money.  Would it be a good thing to destroy the prison? Yes. But, is it a good thing to see the Iraqi President speaking out against Bush's proposal? Yes. Why? Because it shows that the Iraqi Interim Gov't really is independent and to the eyes of the Iraqi people, this is priceless. Is the regular Iraqi guy going to figure it out? Maybe not.   urlLink Reuters: Iraq President Won't Destroy Abu Ghraib Prison
