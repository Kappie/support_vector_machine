She has this uncanny knack of popping up every now and again just when I seem to think I’m over it. Will we always friends C? If I vanish someday ... Will you find me? I try not to think of you C. Believe me I don't want to think of you, because every time I do, I still think someday that we'll meet ,some day things will be as us when clearly there is (was , start with in the 1st place) no us.  Keep having this weird thought of leaving everything behind and going away.Probably one of those strife or crime filled places ..like Phalestine, Iraq, Afghanisthan, Turkey or any of the south American countries.i can take physical pain .. its the emotional women related ones that I cant handle.  I don’t feel like speaking to anyone off late. I just want to alone. I’m not downstairs when Lisa is in the house; I kind of keep telling her that I’m stuck with a problem that I can’t fix... So I can get away acting as though I’m sulking... It gives me lots of space. Its contradictory emotions, wherein you wanna be alone, but you don’t wanna be alone.  I guess that I’m just gonna try and wait these 3 weeks and be done with it. I think I look forward to going home as a way of recouping...in a way I dread going back home.  There is nothing there, besides Mum, which is more like I have to do it because she's Mum.
