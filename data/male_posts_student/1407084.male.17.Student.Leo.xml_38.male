I especially enjoy when there are different people from different cliques, it engages you more with people outside your group, and again, helps you learn what other people do in their free time.   I need to wax my skis.. And get new windshield wipers.. that reminds me.. I gotta work tomorrow. Darn.   Story Time!   There once was this guy who liked this girl. For 3 years, he contemplated telling her how he felt, but since it had been so long since he had talked to her, or even said hi, he felt like there would never be a chance. This guy wished he could tell this girl how he felt, even if she did not feel the same way. To this day he wonders what could have been if he had had more balls. The end. Maybe someday there will be more to this story, but don't count on it. This guy is, in my opinion, too wussy to ever finish this story. This guy will always dream, though...
