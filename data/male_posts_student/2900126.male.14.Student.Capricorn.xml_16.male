They said the reason why they had and 8th grade grauation was because alot of kids weren't graduating from high school I can see why they did it. Yeah well there were kids crying and stuff i guess it's because of joy, some people were moving, and others might not get to graduate from high skewlor maybe they just will miss all of their friends and the school. So yeah i got a whole lot of money and a new watch and I'm supposed to be going to Disney world in july with my aunt and uncle. It should be fun.   Yeah I know i'll miss all the friends I had this school year and next year I'll make new friends but i don't wanna lose my old ones that i have because I feel I can really trust them with anything, even my life. But yeah chichi and sonya are really good friends they are like the best friends i have ever had in my life. So yeah well I don't wanna forget any of the friends I made this year or any of the ones I already had. But yeah I was supposed to learn to swim and play tennis but I have to go to my aunt for some of the summer. oh well.  congradulations to all
