First off, for those who don't know (if there are any), Evolution consists of Ric Flair, Randy Orton, Batista, and, of course, Triple H. They were formed a few years back. The name goes with the members. Ric Flair is the past. Triple H is the present. Randy Orton and Batista are the future of Raw.    Evolution has dominated the Raw roster for as long as they have been formed. They are the essence of a heel faction, good wrestlers who talk the talk, and walk the walk.    Eventually a breakup will occur, however long this takes, nobody is sure. For now, though, they are working hard to stay on top.    I will now break down the Evolution members.    Ric Flair    Ric Flair is a sixteen time World Champion. He is the history of wrestling, and arguably the best wrestler of all time. He is also in his sixties. His prime is over, and his chances of winning the World Heavyweight Title are slim. He is there to teach, and to piss off the fans (though many still like him).  Randy Orton  Randy Orton, like The Rock, is a third generation superstar. He has always known his future, wrestling. I belive Randy brings back some of the "old" stuff, actual wrestling. He isa great wrestler, knows holds well, and I don't believe that he is credited enough. He gives the WWE a bright future, and with a large feud with Edge forming, the WWE's future gets brighter everyday.  Batista  I like Batista. A six foot six monster, he is a great power wrestler. Also holding a bright future, Batista just needs a feud to begin. This feud is to be with Kane! Why can't the WWE see? Make one of them a face! This would be a great feud, and the fans would love it! Hell, put the World Heavyweight Title into it! Make it huge! It's not like the WWE can't promote it!  Triple H  Ahhh, Triple H. If he isn't The Game, then no one is. Obviously gaining fat, Triple H is not the wrestler he used to be. He still puts on the best matches. His Raw match in San Antonio vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Title still gives me chills. I may not like him too much, but I have to admit that he is great.   Well, there is the members of Evolution. Do you see why they are where they are?   When I continue with the Evolution articles, I will discuss the rise to power.
