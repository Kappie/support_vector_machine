That had to be the worst movie ever made, but funny as all hell. It's crappy-factor was on par with  urlLink "Cannibal! The Musical" . I didn't get a chance to watch it with the commentary, so Cannibal is still close to the top of my list of best DVD commentaries. I did try and watch all of the special features and there is a great featurette with the cast talking about making it along with how they each approached playing the "bad actor" parts. After that the movie seemed funnier just because I had a better appreciation for how hard they had to work at being so bad.  I'm seriously thinking about writing a movie like this and producing it. I'm not sure if I'd go sci-fi or not though. I'm leaning more towards a gangster film. I wouldn't want to look like I'm trying to rip-off Cadavra, but the 50's sci-fi genre is so easily made into a ridiculously, funny movie. With my limited movie experience it would be a piece of cake to make it look like crap too. I guess stating that I want to make a film like Cadavra would mean doinga sci-fi film would be an homage to it... Or I would just be a hack stealing other people's good ideas like  urlLink Jay Leno .
