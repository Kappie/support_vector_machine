People doesn't seem to like the 8th season of South Park; why, I don't know. But I think it's pretty good. *blahblahnaggingblah*  Solitude [source:  urlLink dictionary.reference.com ] 1: a state of social isolation 2: a solitary place 3: a disposition toward being alone  One of my favourite words. Not because of the meaning (well, part of it), but I think  that it's beautiful. BTW, I've added some  codes . So scroll down now. On the right side. :)
