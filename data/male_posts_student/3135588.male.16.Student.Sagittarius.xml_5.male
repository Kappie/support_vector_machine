But I opened it up this morning whilst going through my inbox, and chanced to read it.   Reading this made me think about Megan, and how I'd feel if i ever lost her. I dont think I'd cope as well as Jay. Please do me this one thing. Read this. Thats all I ask.        Brittney loved basketball,  Friends and parties too,  And when it came to painting,  That's all she wanted to do.  She painted everything she saw,  Birds, flowers, and the sky,  Some days she sat at her window,  And painted everything that passed her by.  But lately she'd been feeling woozy,  Her muscles ached a lot,  And her parents got kind of worried,  So they took her to the doc.   The doctor took a couple of tests,  To see if everything was okay,  Then the nurse came out with a look of sadness,  And this is what she had to say;    "I'm sorry, but you've got leukemia,"  You've got about 3 months more."  Then Brittney got up and ran out of the room,  And slammed the office door.   She ran down the street screaming,  And cried her eyes out dry,  And stayed up all night,  Wondering what it's like to die.   Her parents held her tightly,  And said, "We love you,"  "We'll make your last few months the greatest,"  "We'll do anything for you."  So Brittney and her parents moved to Florida, to live by the sea,  Because Brittney loved the ocean,  And when she died, that's where she wanted to be.   She spent her days painting,  And horseback riding in by the bay,  But one day she met this guy,  And his name was Jay.   They collected seashells together,  And talked about all kinds of things,  And then one day while walking,  He handed her a ring.   It said, "I love you,"  Which brought tears to Brittney's eyes,  And when he put it on her finger,  She began to cry.   He asked her what was wrong,  and she then replied, "I've got leukemia, and about a month more."  He said," No matter what, I love you  And no matter what, you are the one I adore."   So they spent everyday together,  And swam in the Atlantic all day,  But Brittney was getting weaker,  And it was hard for her stay awake.   So one day Brittney painted her picture,  And gave it to Jay,  She said, "I want you to remember me,"  "Even when I leave this place."  But one day while they were walking,  And searching for seashells in the sand,  Brittney collapsed and started to lose her breath,  And said to Jay, "Please hold my hand."   I love you more than anyone,"  You are my only true love,"  But now my time is up,"  And I'll watch over you from above,"   Then Brittney's body was lifeless,  As she lay in Jay's arms,  And he sat there all day,  And kept her safe from harm.   I hope this teaches you a lesson.  To tell someone you love them whenever you can.   Because maybe they'll be gone tomorrow. And you won't be there to  hold their hand.   Because love is everything to everybody. Without it, the world would be dead. So always tell someone you love them. A  parent, boyfriend/girlfriend, or friend.   It makes a big difference even though you don't think so...Everyone deserves an "I love you."    Because there may be no one for that person to say it back to.
