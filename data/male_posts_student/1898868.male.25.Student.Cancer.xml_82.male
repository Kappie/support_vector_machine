Everyone was screaming and the kid and themom were crying as people were trying to rip the shoe out of the escalator. I was too far away to do anything about it, but I ran over. Just as I got there, some technician guy was opening a door to the escalator, and he pushed some button that stopped it.  2) Coming back home, I saw a guy dressed up in a full-out clown costume getting hassled by the people at security. The guy was literally wearing makeup and had a big red nose and everything, and he was trying to get past the people that check IDs. There was no way you could have figured out who the fuck this guy was. He even had a big flowery dress on and big shoes. So there were a whole bunch of security people standing there looking at his drivers license and shaking their heads. I left before the situation was settled.
