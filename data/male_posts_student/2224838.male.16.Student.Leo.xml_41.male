These were my predictions for the contest:   Picture:   urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King    Director:   urlLink Peter Jackson   Actor:   urlLink Bill Murray   Actress:   urlLink Charlize Theron   Supporting Actor:   urlLink Tim Robbins   Supporting Actress:   urlLink Shohreh Aghdashloo   Animated Feature:   urlLink  Finding Nemo    Original Screenplay:   urlLink  Lost In Translation    Adapted Screenplay:   urlLink  Mystic River    Song:  "Into the West"  If you have nothing better to do like me, make sure to watch.   UPDATE:   The Lord of the Rings  swept the Oscars, winning all 11 of it's nominations, and tying for most Oscar wins ever with  Ben-Hur  and  Titanic . I didn't do too bad on my predicitons, as I was only wrong in three categories: actor, supporting actress, and adapted screenplay. I'm guessing that even three is too many to miss and win the contest.   urlLink Oscar Night: Winners List
