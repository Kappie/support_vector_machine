If this made it's way to VH1's movie formula show, it would get thoroughly pwned. It has a breakfast club brat pack of teams, and they all turn into a little bit of each other by the end (oops did i just give away what a  surprise  ending this had?) But in the end, these kind of movies are good if you have nothing else to watch, but this I think is worth going a little out of your way for, giving it:    ****  *
