Jamie, me, you and Fish need to talk on msn in a convo, most likely Monday to decide on the forums? Fish is considering quite seriously. I'll stick in a pound a month instead of 50p. Call me generous ^^. The reason i wasn't on today was because i was working at mum's takeaway. Don't expect me on tomorrow either. I'll just be working on Friday for this week...normally just Sat. 3Fusion sounds good and l33t i must say and uhmm...i shall visit Sheckington now. So goodnight. Or goodmorning i should say...(geez...four in the f-BEEP- morning.)  Tull ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
