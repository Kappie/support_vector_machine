It was pretty insightful and it basiclly said that visualization is imagination. Then he gave an excerise to do which was pretty easy. The next chapter was about mobile body awareness and it contained excerises to concentrate you awareness to one specific part of you body. It was pretty cool. Well dats all i have read. Again if anyone has read this book or knows how 2 perform OBE then please write back i would like 2 hear from you.
