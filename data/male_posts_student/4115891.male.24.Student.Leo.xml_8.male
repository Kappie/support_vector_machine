The formating is a little strange due to the transfer from word to the blog window.  So here it is...     Cove Point  It was the morning of what had thus far promised to be a most superb day.   In the air hung the slightest steep of grass freshly cut merely two days ago.  This was occasionally diluted by slight puffs of sea air, indicated only by the graceful sway of the weeping willows which had for so many years guarded the lower portion of the yard.  The sounds of this particular morning were oddly hushed, as if the birds in the trees were aware of the almost certain balminess of the coming day, and had rationed their energies accordingly.   A boy of twelve slipped quietly through the yard.  His bare feet carried him in long gates down its hilly embankment, threatening to topple him under unsure footing due to a far too hasty pace.  As he neared the bottom and the willow trees he felt his feet begin to sink into the soft mud that had always betrayed this portion of the property as part of a wetland which had been cut off by a perpetually sinking gravel road.  There he halted, turned about, feet sopping, and let lose a piercing whistle that tore the early summer silence.  A rustling began somewhat far off in the woods surrounding the yard and approached steadily until the hedges and saplings that divided grass from trees gave way, and the rustling begat a dog.  Together the boy and the dog walked out upon the gravel road and disappeared from the yard. The road split the trees that would have otherwise run uninterrupted to the wetlands, and allowed the new sun to shine on occasion upon the boy’s naked shoulders.  The roads sharper stones that appeared every now and again caused the boys body to slink forward and heave backwards in a most unnatural manner.  Upon this road the boy and the dog made their way, the boy teetering, and the dog prancing excitedly around him. Finally the travelers emerged from the trees and into the sun.  Their trip on the road ended when both stepped off the rocky pass through some tall grass and finally onto the warm gritty sand of a beach.  The boy took a seat under a rickety pagoda which leaned far too much for the comfort of any who cared about such things, and the dog mingled in the shallow waves of a slight shoal that it dared not enter fully. Sitting the boy gazed at the road by which he had come.  Here the road cut yet another unnatural path between the beach and the wetland that had at this point become more of a lake.  Twisting his head he briefly took in the forest that sloped dramatically upward as it approached the water until it was jaggedly cut downward by sandy cliffs.  Slightly past it jutted a few massive boulders comprised of rusty iron ore and sand.  Further still laid a vast expanse of smooth flat beach that seemed to stretch in a mile long horse shoe until it met the sea.  At its apex stood a thin white light house surrounded by a few darker squatty houses that seemed to prostrate themselves in the presence of such a regal structure.  His attention next turned to the sea.  It was a bay of brackish water, and on most days one could barely make out the outline of the eastern shore.  The long flat workboats of fishermen lethargically zigzagged across the water checking crab pots.  The fishermen existed in a portion of the bay that was deceptively close but still reasonably far to swim, though the boy had often thought to venture out himself.  Slowly his attention turned upon his feet which he had by this time sunk ankle deep into the sand.  This in turn focused him upon himself and the deep satisfaction he had in being here.  ***   His right hand reached instinctively to his chest, and there it stayed.  His body spun with the force of impact around his left foot, his right kicking up dust as it slid from under his frame.  A second bolt wedged itself through skin above the hip and tore seething through flesh, bile, and membrane until it vacated the body just below the left rib with a splash of liquid.  This subsequent impact convoluted the path of his body through the air, throwing his head sideways and outward in unnatural fashion.  His left shoulder was first to the rocky soil followed by his left then right knees.  Still drawn by the invisible forces of the barrage his body spun onto its back and skidded to a stop.  There he laid; a ragged body gushing liquid life in rhythm with the palpitations of his heart.   “Boom, boom, boom, boom!”  ***  “Boom, boom, boom, boom.” Left hand. “Boom, boom, boom, boom.” Right hand. The low rumble of a bass drum overpowered his right ear.  The metallic sizzle of a crash cymbal dragged across its cohort penetrated his left.  The heals of his feet pulsed numbly up and down though it was barely visible above his waist.  In his right hand he raised a drum stick eight inches above the head of a snare drum and brought it down in one quick motion.  Eight times this occurred until without any hitch in the rhythm he switched to his left hand.  He was well aware that his eyes were to be straight ahead yet this could not stop their wandering. Slowly his pupils danced to the right.  They crossed the field, every five yards of which was worn in long dirty troughs.  People walked by conversing and smiling holding instruments of twisted brass and button they began to line up along the mud.  His eyes followed the trumpet line to his right until there was a characteristic dip in its height.  Here stood a girl, staring blankly into the shoulders of the boy in front of her.  She was small.  Very small, no more than ninety-five pounds and barely nine inches over four feet.  Her face was soft and innocent, like that of a child.  She was indeed a very old child who had somehow embraced the vices of her early twenties and yet remained blameless.  As if aware of his gaze she lifted her eyes and directed them instinctively towards his.  The emptiness of her face gave way to a crooked smile.  His lips returned in kind, cracking the serious scowl he wore customarily while playing.  Quickly she looked away and directed her attentions to her instrument. Though her gaze was no longer fixed on him, her presence was still very near.  It goaded him into thinking, and gradually he relinquished control of his perfect legato strokes and sunk into contemplation.  He thought of the years in high school they had spent in casual acquaintance and the near five years since he had loved her.  He thought of the friends they had shared and not shared.  He lingered briefly upon the pains and displeasure she had with her family at first, and how it had eventually eased.  Often he felt like he had made her, put her back together in her difficult times by his own will.  Sometimes he wondered if he had done it right, and sometimes he lamented he certainly had not.  He had a passive love for her, like a dull burn that was never quenched but sometimes flooded.  He wondered if he was now the right person for her.  He loved her steadily and carefully, but now that she was better she needed more.  He contemplated the slow agony it would cause him if she were ever to find this out. “Boom, boom, boom, gack!”  The basses stopped pounding, the reverberations of the cymbals choked against flesh, and the piercing cries of the snare drums halted. “Boom, boom …” He went on.  His third right stroke was his last. “Boom.”  Instinctively both sticks returned end over end to his right hand and fell to his side.  The gazes of twenty odd drummers fell upon him.  Blushing he relaxed his shoulders and muttered an apology.  One by one their stares released him, their owners walked to the mud labeled as the fifty yard line and formed a line.  He followed.  ***  	He could only hear his heart and see nothing.  The only other sense of life was an overwhelming metallic tang that lay upon his tongue like a tarnished iron spoon.   He lay for a painless moment upon invisible soil, until his senses caught up with the fall.  Gradually a slurry of light focused and became the reality of the situation which his brain could not yet conceptualize.  A speck of sand ,then another, and another, and then many all at once, and a pebble. All re-introduced themselves to his orientation and created before his eyes a miniature world.  Then a behemoth speckled in tan and gray shot from the heavens and crushed it.  Its wrath was quick and destruction complete and it left a neat imprint of its furry as it flew off again to destroy another world somewhere else.  Just beyond the destruction of this world hovered two great orbs and bellow them a jumble of gristly mountains that flowed into a see of red.  These he recognized.  They were eyes of the dead, eyes too wide for life.    ***   An urchin of seven squeezed noisily through a sliding glass door that had discourteously been left open by its previous user.  His disheveled hair jutted forth in loose curls that suspended themselves a few inches above his scalp.  His shirt, although fresh an hour ago, had already established an off color ring around his collar and markings that stretched down toward his chest.  Softly this boy padded out onto the adjoining deck and down the stairs onto the lawn. 	He was followed post haste by a sister of the age of ten who carried the boy’s sandals in her left hand.   “Hey” she screamed, “mom says you hafta put your sandals on.” The sister had short hair that was a somber shade of brown, a pert nose and ruddy cheeks.  She dressed in green corduroy overalls, with a white tee-shirt, and her feet were adorned with cloth sandals that had crisscrossing color bars across the straps.  She was a sister in every sense of the word; often the protagonist of trouble, and often the unwilling victim, often in the apprenticeship of her parents, and often in avoidance of their edicts.  Her realm was that of the only daughter. She swiftly flew out of the gaping doorway and gave chase to him.  They eventually settled on the outskirts of the yard which was bordered by the neighboring property, and a thick glade of thorn bushes which gave way to the tall trees of the surrounding forest.  Here the boy sat and at the urging of his sister, placed the sandals awkwardly upon his feet.  	“They’re too big” he mumbled, “I can’t do anything in them.” His plight was quickly forgotten however as both set out to swing by a rope that had long been dangling from the branches of a tree whose genus no one had, nor cared to identify.  It was merely sufficient that this trees branch was suitable to hold the rope of massive diameter tied at the end by a large twister of knots that provided a seat for the children to swing themselves by to deadly heights over the steeply sloping yard.   They had been at swinging not ten minutes when a shrill cry that began as an “Ah” and tapered off into a sustained “rrrrrg” sounded from deep inside the dimmed house.  This was followed by a low rolling sound and the slamming of the door.  Thinking very little of this the children continued their swinging.   ***  	The pain had not sunk in yet, but it nagged at the back of his mind as if it knew it was coming and wished to remind him.  The sand in front of him had ceased to be his world and the globes which had orbited it were now very real reminders of his situation.  The monsters that darted by became the booted feet of much larger agents of destruction.  The world which was once his had now become a pool of mingled blood, and those who had fallen here its contributors.  Suddenly the world moved and the scenery changed.  First the sky and the sun, and then these drove upwards as a new horizon of mangled mess appeared.  The mess wore his boots on its twitching legs, and his uniform on its gushing body.  A helmeted face hovered above it, and for the first time he heard something behind the pounding of his ears.   “…edic! Sir everything will be alright.  You’re ok…”  The words did not fit the expression.  ***  He sat at desk in his room.  Looking up at what he had done.  Bachelor of Arts… Philosophy… University of Maryland.  He had done it.  And it was framed and it was big, but it did not satisfy.  For months he had been looking and for months he had found nothing.  No job.  Well he had a job but not a career.  He sat shamefully in a basement and dealt overpriced textbooks to people as if the knowledge they contained was crack cocaine.  That was not a career.  But for now it paid for the paper mounted on the wall. He still sat.  He had nothing else to do.  Sometimes he would get up and stretch, but mostly he sat.  The truth is he was alone, constantly and deeply alone. He had no friends.  He had forsaken them for a girl that had outgrown his usefulness.  He had no direction.  The jokes about unemployed philosophers had finally caught up to him.  He had nothing.  The loneliness was making him bitter and he knew it.  He had tried to do something about it.  He had lifted weights, boxed, had been active but this only served to transform the bitterness into rage. His eyes disengaged the sheet of paper on the wall and looked downward to the sheet on his desk.  It was crisp and white with the words ‘United States Marine Corps’ emblazoned on the letter head.  Perhaps it was a rare and unsubstantiated destructive impulse coupled with the bitterness and rage that had been growing in his system.  Perhaps it was a bit of lunacy that had set in during his depression.  What ever it was, it was something other than himself that wrote the words ‘infantry’ and then signed his name.  ***  	The medic had come and stuck a needle in him and rolled him onto a gurney.  The sound of his heart was fading, as were the pops and hissed of battle behind it.  He was looking at the sky again.  The sun burned his retina, and his eyes would not close.  The wind blew up sand that on occasion surrounded him like a shroud.  He was not aware of the hoisting or subsequent movement of his vinyl bedding.   He felt nothing, he was comfortably numb.  The pain had never come, it had tricked him, it had promised and then left and he was disappointed.  Pain would be a good thing now; something to lift him up out of the dull gray feeling of his body.  His tongue was heavy and no longer tasted the metallic twinge of blood that had been pouring from his mouth.  All he knew now was the sun, that damn blinding sun.  ***  The urchin padded the sand and his sister stuck a stick in it.  This was done for two very important reasons.  First this was a warning to passers by that a sea nettle lay buried here.  Secondly it served as a memorial to the poor creature that had been washed ashore.   The boy sat still under the pagoda watching the urchin and his sister’s solemn faces as they performed this meaningful and somber duty.   “Does mom know you’re down here?”  He asked. “Does mom know YOU’RE down here?” Replied the sister, who quickly returned to sticking a new mound. “Whatever.” The boy replied. The dog had retreated to the relative safety of the sand and was hacking from consuming too much sea water.  After a few more hacks the sea water returned to the shore and the dog waddled over to the pagoda and the boy. The boy glanced at his siblings work.  The shore line was dotted with many such mounds with sticks.  It was truly noble work.  He looked out into the bay and the boats.  His father was out there somewhere on his boat named after his daughter.  His eyes scanned up the sandy coast beyond the cliffs and beyond the boulders until they reached the light house.  Its great light flashed and then it was gone.
