I don't getit............why bog students down with stupid things such as "all numbers can be written as primes or have a prime factor in them"..............i mean, a number is a number!!! stop touching it! and stop asking students to prove things such as "There are a finite number of primes of the form 4k+3"...........Basically my point here is, "I DON'T CARE!!!!".............i'm satisfied doing normal maths................i don't care if the greatest common divisor of 2 integers are the minimum primes of each number........  sigh.........wish i could say the same for exams.................back to books...............  nvm..........*lun lun*.............i will lun.................just 24hrs and im free...........*lun*
