Was talking to bitter, smoker, half Japanese, con artist Micole today. Since neither of us had any money, she decided to steal everything necessary for a picnic. After the full extent of her masta thief skills were swiftly exercised, we had a ghetto picnic at jamba juice with her friend. HA. Must make that a routine for the duration of work...Being two days...Damn.   HA! Wiesled out of working on mural. Air tight. Micole's all pro con artist ways must be rubbing off on me.
