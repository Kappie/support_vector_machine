I now own an absolutely BRILLIANT Telescope, brought at an amazingly bargain price from eBay!  I can't wait to use it to look at the moon or the planets.  I'll be able to take photographs from it as well    Today was England's first football match in Euro 2004 - like I care.  We got caught up in tesco whilst innocently buying sweets and stuff.  Football fans and hooligans from across stafford seemed to have all gathered in Tesco to buy peanuts, popcorn, beer, and any other snack they could grab their hands on.    I bought a bottle of Dr. Pepper, some minty Dairy Milk and other stuff.  Me and Craig then went to call for Chris and then went across to Rowley Park.  It was so quiet!  The sun wasn't far off setting and was casting brilliant light all over the clean grounds of Rowley Park.  We hung around the park for a bit and eventually went because Chris and Craig had to be in.  It was like walking through a desert!  Most of the roads were completely empty, even the Wolverhampton Road!    All of the football crazed fans and alike were gathered int heir living rooms worshiping their TV screens and watching people run around a field.  At least there were no cars with flags on the roads.  I'm sick to death of seeing these flags on every single car, shoved in every single place possible such as side windows, sunroof, ariels and boots.  I found another place they can go...
