We then headed to Dollywood. Fun fun fun. The ride, well was hilarious. My aunt is crazy, cracks me up. She made the trip awesome. Rode the rollercoasters first, thunderhead. It was pretty wild, didnt scare me though. I sat with Alaina through everything. I rode the other roller coaster, Tennessee Twiser, twice. The second time me and Alaina or actually Alaina and I but stfu, rode in the front. It beat my head to death. The very last ride, ze ferris wheel. Im not afraid of heights but dag gomit, Alaina kept bending over and the thing was rocking, I was gonna freak. I dunno that really bothered me. I got to know her better though so thats great. I bought  a season pass.  Went home, sat in back with Alaina. Then went to my Aunt, Karens. Ate. Then rode britts go kart, and then Alaina rode with me, forever. I lost my wallet. I found it later in the road XD. Everything was in there lol. Then we went to Target. It was pretty fun. Saw Hank and Mariah but they didnt enter. Now Im home, and tired. Might go to bed soon
