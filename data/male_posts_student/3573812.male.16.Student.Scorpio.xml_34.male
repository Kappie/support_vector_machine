I definitely don't remember being in the state of mind to write my last post, which I guess is a good thing because I can't have been too happy. I guess that I always feel that way but it's buried deep inside me so I don't always realise it. Then I display these pseudo-feelings so that the people around me don't question me. I suppose is just that time of the month. And I'm nottalking about PMS. I mean the time where I become very self-analytical and such. It probably has something to do with the moon.   Anyway, lets move on.   I have recently become very obsessed with Alanis Morissette. I listen to  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie  almost daily. I just love her songs. I can't put into words the feelings and thoughts that they bring up.   Surrey and I went to  urlLink Leith 's house last night. I got wasted drinking cheap wine that smelled and looked no better than carbonated urine (it tasted like such I assume) and vodka. Oh and vodka and wine mixed together. It wasnice. Not very many people turned up. And I wasthe only true drunk one. We went to this Jesse's house to watch DVDs. We started watching  Back to the Future , but me and Leith left, walking for about an hour and a half to get home. It was so cold. Me clutching my bottle of wine and not being able to walk in a straight line. I put the bottle on the ground next to a building when we got into town, meaning to pick it up again later. We didn't go back that way so it could possibly still be sitting there. Probably not though. So I had fun. It was good.
