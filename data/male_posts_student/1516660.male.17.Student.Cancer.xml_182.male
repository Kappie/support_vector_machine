I always read the Sunday Times...read almost the whole paper (except classified), after which read The New Paper on Sunday. I have to complete reading before 11. HaHa!   Then, at 11, I did the same old thing of alternating between watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge and surfing the Net. Ha! I finally settled down to watch Huan Zhu Ge Ge at 12.45, whenh I eat my lunch. Ji called and ask about SS. Me-ow meow!  I went to Wendy's house to study for my Bio Prac. I wore a new shirt there....those sports shirt with extra long sleeve until the elbow. Mother brought for Brother some time back when she brought bed-sheets in John Little. He didn't want, so I took it. Wendy said I looked quite nice. She also thought that shirt was a hand-me-down. No la where got! We studied for about two hours or so, then we chatted. Chatted about chalet ar, about so many other things (which means confidential info). After that, me and Wendy made instant noodles for ourselves. Woah! I sweated so much. HaHa! Then, I watched Rainbow Brite the movie with Wendy. What a cute cartoon! Loved the story. HaHa!! After that, went back into the room to talk some more la.  I ate dinner (chicken rice) with them in 888. Yvonne reportedly saw me with Wendy whilst walking out of the food court! HaHa! Cool! After that went home and came online lor.   Ayiah! Tomorrow a lot of people go back to shcool you know! I am the only one that's not going. Ayiah. I feel very happy you know. Finally leh. can get break from school. From attending school lessons. I felt free. And now by going back, I am being tied back down again. So...restrictive. I hate it. HMM!  Okay! I am very vexed at messenger! Darn them! I think I go liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
