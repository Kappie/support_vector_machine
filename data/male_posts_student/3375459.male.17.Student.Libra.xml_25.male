I was sneezing so much I didn't want to do anything, including drawing. It felt so much like I've got water in my sinus. And now a running nose, guess I new a box of tissue next to me later when I sleep. If I know myself better, its going to take me quite a few days to get better. God I wish the monster crane would not be facing my flat during the next few days. * SNEEZE * SHIT MAN!! I've to wipe the monitor screen again. Ok, I guess I should do so now... BYeZ
