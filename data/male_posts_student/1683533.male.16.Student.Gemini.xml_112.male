Mike quit the band...I kinda saw it coming though so...yea...now I have bit of a dilemna, I need a drummer...again...Marty is gonna ask Evan Beck and I will ask around.  I really have bad luck with bands I guess...maybe I should give up...  of course I wont tho...  or will i..?  "The world is spinning out of control! It's all about money!" -Suicide Machines
