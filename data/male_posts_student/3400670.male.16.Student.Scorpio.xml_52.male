It's really urgent in that I was ridiculous chosen today in the Northwest Science Expo to take apart in the annual ISEF (Intel Science and Engineering Fair) (Representing get this: TEAM OREGON!)............And that happens during the second week of May!!!!!! I have to stay in portland the WHOLE WEEK and that week also freakishly coincides with AP Tests!!!!!!!!! So I have AP Chemistry test on Tuesday that I DEFINITELY CANNOT take in the Jim Parsley Center..........I have to either take the AP test DURING ISEF.....Which would require you to mail in the AP registration forms (By bloody this Tuesday), or I have to take it on a makeup day at JPC.......But in any case, the signup for me to take the test on May 10th AP Chem test at JPC is completely void now.  I'm SOOOOOOOOOOO GRAVELY SORRY about this really short notice of this ridiculous inconvenience.  Hopefully you can take notice of this blog post as soon as possible.  Thomas Chen
