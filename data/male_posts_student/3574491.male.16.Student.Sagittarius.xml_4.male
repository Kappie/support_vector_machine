Well I Was Feeling really bored and exhausted after a dirty,filthy,nasty lecture from our dear class teacher Mrs.Jayashri About...well.....I Think that the topic of discussion was initialy discipline....But i failed to keep track of how she went from bus compatriot to saliva splilling to inter gender discrimination....  Actually I have a lot of respect for this old,short and energyless lady but the very problem of me not listening arised because somebody sitting in front of me ...srikanth or badri proarbly had a skunk for lunch and farted like they have never farted all through the afternoon...proarbly thats the reason why i saw and ambulance in school today thru the class window...to provide badly needed oxygen...  Then today...i shall never forget for 10 lifetimes to come...Mrs.Mangala's Definition Of a limit...i dont get it....someone please tell me what the hell a limit has to do with kk nagar,valasaravakam,neseapakkam,and any other bakkkam and pakkam in town.......she's nuts  For All those who dont know Mrs.Mangala though i doubt if any person out there in this small world that is overfilled with unwanted human beings is ever going to read my blog in the next century....She happens to be our maths teacher  She's actually a very nice person but trust me u dont wanna get on her bitter side..  Then as for the rest of the day in school...we had a few nice jokes that we shared like Ramani's Election Symbol to be a broomstick and of course a daily routine ragging of our dearest classmate .............Prasad....  Then Going Back To the First Period of the day,I got scolded by Malathi Santhanam...Courtesy Ramkumar...and well that about wraps up yet another uneventful day in my highly eventful life as a high school student.....Looking back at "The Wonder Years" of my life kinddaaa makes me sad that this is my last year of schooling.  Well better get to my books...
