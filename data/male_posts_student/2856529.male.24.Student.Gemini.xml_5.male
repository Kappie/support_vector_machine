Today Vikram Sampath added me on to his Orkut network list and now I am proud to say that I am wired to 900118 people of whom I actually know, maybe47. That should say something about the ubiquity of the internet and the anonymity afforded by it. (I could have used simpler words in the previous sentence but where is the fun in that.)
