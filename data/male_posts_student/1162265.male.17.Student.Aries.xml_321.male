I'm trying to figure when to get it, I've already decided the spot on my arm, it'll be high enough up on my arm so my sleeve covers it. I just worry that my skin on my arm may tan and the tattoo won't look right, but Gennine has 18 tattoos (she claims) so it can't look that bad.   The other major thing is when do I get it? Do I want to get it before swim season to show off, and make my parents pissed off, or do I wait until I'm 18?
