Sorry guys :( Secondly, have you recently stolen blueprints to the Deathstar? Are you and your rebel pals looking for a way to display said plans. Well look no further,  urlLink IO2Technologies  has developed the worlds first screenless monitor.  They had to take down their demo videos because their bandwidth usage was getting to high, but the  urlLink screenshots  are still up.  Many Bothans died to bring us this information...
