After school I had to comfort some people that didn't make it to the next year and had to do this one over. After that I just hung around. I went out for ice after that. I originally asked Tjitske out for ice, but I asked Feline to come along. Good thing I did that. I barely even talked to Tjitske. And I had to pay for her ice cream! Grmf. With Feline I had much more fun. She makes me laugh. I talked to her for like 2,5 hours straight after the ice cream thing. That's long. But she had to go because she needed to do 2 book reports in 3 days (including this one). Else she's going to be kicked off school. And 2 book reports, that takes a lot of time. When you look at character, she definitely would be perfect ot be my girl friend. She makes me laugh, I can talk to her. She is the closest thing to be being in my situation (depression, brother has handicap; that's almost me). And she's in to doing things after school. The thing why she isn't my girlfriend is 1) I don't see her a lot 2) She could well be qualified as a strange person 3) She's not exactly easy on the eyes 4) Not really into having a boy friend, I'm afraid. There's this girl at work who looks horrible. Seriously. But after work, she does her hair different, put's on different clothes and some makeup. And then she looks good. Sure there are still a lot of people prettier, be you can't really call her ugly anymore.
