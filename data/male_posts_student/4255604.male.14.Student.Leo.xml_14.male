They played the National Anthem so well that it put some patriotism back in me, and I realised that yes, I did know all the words of the National Anthem, which I was muttering under my breath. For those who don't know, I really am not a very patriotic person, and neither am I religious (I'm practical an atheist, an unbeliever).  My only event today was the last event, so I had to pass my time in the Pandal watching Senior Declamation, which was good, I must say (it was on Outsourcing and how it's evil), but firstly, it wasn't a Declamation as they promised, but it was actually more of a Debate because some people were for, and some were against the motion, and secondly, all of the speakers (save one) missed two big fat important points (which I don't really want to discuss here) and that was just pathetic. Plus, I could see from their speeches that each of them had typed in "Outsourcing" into Google and they were all saying  exactly  the same things and quoting the same figures. That was that.   Senior Quiz  started a bit late, as expected. The quiz-master was an alumnus of the same school and it was obviously his first quiz (either that, or he's generally pathetic) and he was sweating like hell. This quiz even left Mr. Quizzer Outsourcer dazed (but not speechless). To answer each question, one was given a whopping  5 seconds!! For logic questions, 10 seconds. So, basically most teams weren't able to answer. The rapid fire round was 15 seconds each and at max. one could get three or four questions. Let me cut to the chase, we ended up getting second position. The quiz-master first announced us as the winners, then their scoring software coughed up a hair-ball and suddenly put this stupid school ahead of us by three points. With their Ahlconian attitude (long story about Ahlcon Public School... they disqualified us from the overall trophy for some null reason - basically, people who don't listen to reason), they didn't listen of course. I'm also very doubtful about their home-grown scoring software because it had previously added (right in front of the whole audience) 5+5+10 = 10. We didn't have a chance for the Overall anyway because numerous morons (namely: Gursartaj, Dhruv, Abhishek Suri, Abhisheyk Gaur, Manas Gautam, Mohit Taneja, et al) either didn't show up for this event or they didn't win anything (all but the last name are people who didn't show up because of pathetic reasons and they should be lynched in my humble opinion); hence, I chucked it and walked off carrying a 2nd Position trophy, which is extremely pathetic because I think that in a quiz, one should either bag the event or get nothing.  We won  Senior Programming !! I am so happy that SP is working out well because I didn't want Exun to lose its fort while I'm in Presidency. I would obviously never want Exun to disregard its crux, but if it ever does, let it not be while I'm, uh,  in power . Mr. Azgez went home carrying two first position trophies from his first symposium, which I consider to be quite commendable.   --Karan Misra President, Exun  We take printouts
