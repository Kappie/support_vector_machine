As his own word goes for all of us BAND OF NINE, we all are  miserably beautiful, erratically exciting  and  fuckingly cool  guys (including him!!!) . I have been ever jealous of him during my stay with him during my IIT days. My inelegant way of pronouncing the polysyllabic Hindi and English words was the source of constant of entertainment for my wingmates. While, unlike me, Vikram , though hails from the same part of India as do I, can weave webs of words around all of us in a very poetic manner and  his eloquence and etymological calibre  left me in  a unbelievable state of scariness . The phonophobia in me for English and Hindi reasons back me to him. But, time and again his surprising elements through his poems never dies. I got a snail mail from him few days ago (in this age of Internet and all !!!) and this poem accompanied that letter.   Totally New     Totally new to this I thought I would miss But then came the target It was a claen hit  Totally new to that I thought I was bad But then came the light It was a start act  Totally new to act I knew I would fart But flew past the first note And I sang till the last  Totally new to the vast sea Sure was I to first pee But then came the king wave And I stoked a killing spree  Totally new to the act of love I declared I was a sitting duck But then came by the prettiest girl And we redefined the meaning of fuc*  Totally New to the core emotions Somewhere inside was a starnger me But then came my first child A relection set a father free  Moments Unparalelled, My life unbounded Unfolded before me Generation of LOVE.  Everything I did I did for the FIRST time Every single thing Strange except one...  Totally new to this world line I thought I must have cried But them claimed my wonderful life Haven't a smiling man died !!!
