So, I've slowly noticed that the work-load at school is slowly increasing, still not too bad though. With my first GCSE exam just over 10 weeks away, I'm fairly surprised that I am not yet panicking (or revising..) Well, it's only a German exam, so not too bad. This morning I've been doing some Business Studies homework - very dull. Who wants to know about the growth of firms anyway? And yesterday was fun, fun english homework. 'What different approaches or attitudes to death are explored in Tichbourne's Elergy, Mid Term Break and at least one other poem of your choice' Believe me, that was far from fun, despite the fact that half of it had already been written onto the board by teacher good ol' Mr Herbert. ('Look boys, I'm reeeeealy starting to panic now, we absolutely haven't got time for this, the exams are a matter of weeeeks away, believe me, this time is going to fly by' (Welsh accent, of course!)) Oh yes, and maths homwork of course. That was... interesting. Something called 'integration', trying to find gradients of lines and the like. The class on Friday was as usual..(Shut up, yeah? talking... *shakes head, stern look on face*) Ah, and geography of course (hmmm, impression of geograohy teacher... errr 'Can you just try and focus? I'll be very interested to see your parents on parents evening' (That wasn't a particually good impression) The homework wasn't too bad 'produce a leaflet to inform people of the water quality issues in the world. You must then discuss the possible management strategies that could be use to make water more sustainable' Well, that took me about an hour of very boring research (copy and pasting) and organising it all nicely, but the finished result looks ok. And finally there's German. (I'm not even going to try and do an impression of my German teacher.. she is... fairly normal) I should have learnt about words for a vocab test... but that would be boring so I've skipped that. Well, that's been my weekend, other than browsing nationstates, neopets, and a forum me and my friends have.   I haven't been outside the house since Friday comming home from school (what a sad life I lead) and I doubt I will leave untill 0740 when I leave for school tomorrow. Oh, I have to fill out my 6th Form application form this afternoon so that I can stay on at school for a further two years. I have decided to take Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Computing. A fairly solid choice I think. Well, that will be all for now, I'm running out of things to say.... Ta Ta all.
