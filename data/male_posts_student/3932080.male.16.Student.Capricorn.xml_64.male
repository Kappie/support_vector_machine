Featuring racy categories like  Reality/Variety Jackass  (winner  Simon Cowell ) and  Movie Your Parents Didn't Want You to See  (winner  American Wedding ), there was no telling where  Fox  was going to take this year's outlet for teenage opinions. Hosts  Paris Hilton  and  Nicole Richie  will churn through the 37 awards on Wednesday night, some normal and others, well, not. Big winners include  The O.C.  and its cast, together nabbing 4 awards, RB maestro  Usher , who took home 4 music awards,  Ashton Kutcher , who (along with  Punk'd ) grabbed 3 awards,  Adam Sandler , who took home 2 individual awards, and  Ashlee Simpson , who also received 2 awards. The night's brightest star, though, was  Lindsay Lohan , who won 4 individual categories for her work in  Mean Girls  and  Freaky Friday . Among those 4 are  Comedy Movie Actress  (for  Mean Girls ),  Movie Breakout Star  (for both works), and, called her "most precious award,"  Puberty Inducer  (for gigantic breasts).
