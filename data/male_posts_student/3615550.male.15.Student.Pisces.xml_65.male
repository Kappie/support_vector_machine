The World Court, however, has  urlLink ruled  that Israel has no right to defend herself.  At least, not in any effective manner.  The part of the wall that has thus far been constructed has saved many lives already, and will hopefully continue to do so.  A corrupt, biased court has attempted to override the national sovereignty of the nation of Israel, instead favoring the right to violence of an agressive terrorist society.    I just don't understand the reasoning behind the World Court's decision.  How is this supposed to decrease violence?  How are lives saved by denying defensive rights to a beseiged nation?  All that is accomplished by denying Israel the right to take defensive measures, something that is completely out of bounds for the World Court, is the satisfaction of terrorists, and that will not get anyone anywhere.  Though they will be satisfied, they will by no means be pacified; rather, they will be strengthened by receiving exactly what they have been working for and will meet kindness (or at least obedience) with renewed vigor in terrorist attacks.  Remember, don't feed the animals.  It is a travesty of justice for a court to rule in favor of avowed terrorists and order a sovereign nation such as Israel to make herself vulnerable to terrorist and guerilla tactics.  It is proof of the insanity or out time, and it is proof that anti-Semitism lives on despite the tragic memories of the Holocaust.  A Holocaust is still happening, and now it is happening in the Jewish homeland.  No longer are the Nazis mass-murdering Jews, but now it is the Muslims who attack and terrorize Israelis, indoctrinated differently, but by the same spirit as the Nazis.    In the world today, a Nazi is despicable.  The Nazis are seen for what they were, and few cling to their beliefs now.  However, a new anti-Semitic power is rising, and it is called radical Islam.  They indoctrinate children from birth to hate the Jews, and they send them to Israel strapped to explosives, vainly hoping for seventy virgins as a reward for their good deeds against the people who are referred to as "the descendents of apes and pigs" in the holy book of Islam.    Now, the radical Muslims have an added protection that the Nazis didn't have.  Whereas the Nazis were a political group, not necessarily united by race, but rather by ideology, the Muslims are a racial group.  To denounce Islam is considered tantamount to denouncing Arabs, and is quickly censored.  In this politically correct age, wrong is considered indefinable except in terms of intolerance.  Unfortunately, biggest intoleration of all is ignored, for pointing it out would be considered intolerance, rather than prudence.    These things indicate how far our feel-good culture has slipped into multiculturalism; we have struggled to be more open-minded for so long that our mind has fallen out.  No longer can we call evil evil, for to do so might hurt the feelings of the evil we speak of, and that would be truly evil.  Intolerance has been deemed the worst of all crimes and sins, but it has yet to be correctly defined.  Intolerance is now seen to be disagreement, and therefore all ideological disagreements with groups such as gays and welfare abusers are deemed intolerant and bigoted.  Meanwhile, Israel continues to suffer the per-capita equivalent of a 9/11 every week at the hands of the most active group of bigots ever to be supported by the civilized world.  If the Palestinians have a right to use terror tactics, then Israel should have a right to defend herself.  Israel is often condemned for capturing or killing Palestinian terrorists, the equivalent of enemy combatants, should the Palestinians be fighting a legitimate war.  Meanwhile, the Palestinians inflict heavy losses, not on Israeli military forces, but on the civilians who are going about their peaceful daily lives.  Such tactics are despicable, and any nation that supports them is thereby holding a double standard, allowing the Palestinians to fight illegally, while forcing Israel to fight with two hands tied behind her back.  Just how civilized is Europe and the U.N.?  Not civilized enough to recognize racism and bigotry, apparently.  Peace (through strength) y'all. Neo
