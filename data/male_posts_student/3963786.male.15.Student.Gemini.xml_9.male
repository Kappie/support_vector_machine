I totally and completely screwed up. With a capital "SCREWED" I dont even know why I did it. Yesterday was Fish day and I was supposed to call Nikki, and I didnt. I don't know why, but I didn't. I worked from 7am to 2pm, and I had a full 2 hours to call her on my break, but i didnt. then i got off of work at 6pm, and I still didnt. i wanted to call her, i tried to get myself to call her, but i couldnt. i dont know why. why the hell would i do this to myself??? i just wanted to be with her all day, and i wouldnt even let myself call her, and i had so many opportunities. now she doesnt even want to talk to me, and i dont blame her. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself and why i would do this. She's so great, and amazingly nice and always puts people in front of herself,andtons of other things that icant get into becausethere isnt enough room on the internet,and i love to be around her and just wonder about how she can be all these things, and still like me.....at least i dont have to worry about this anymore, because she's never going to talk to me again, and i halfway hope she doesnt. for her sake.   maybe ashley was right.
