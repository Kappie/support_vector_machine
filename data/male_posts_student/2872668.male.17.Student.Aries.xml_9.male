Near it, the letters LmY stood out from the random graffiti. I wonder. Coincidences are a God's work.   I reenter the room redolent of earlier times, of youthful exuberance and curiosity...of Innocence that is forever lost. The familiar objects lie in their usual positions, neverchanging, rotting silently. Warm musty air filled the room. A silence shrouded the room amidst the cacophony of a variety of musical instruments. I slip between the obstacles, reaching a chair and pulling it next to my friend. He sits calmly with an air of assurance, his head cocked up, his posture relaxed. Hesitant for a moment, I fiddle about clumsily with the Erhu, tryin to play remnants of songs long forgotten, as though recalling memories long lost.   ...did i ever escort her home? did she really hug my arm?...nothin but a bottomless, yawning ravine remains of my memories now. Out of the blue, I see her peeking around the door, seemingly contemplating the idea of coming into the room. Then she thinks better of it, and scurries away with her fren. I give a sigh of relief, as i come out from my momentary abode, meeting my fren outside. We stroll with a sense of knowing. She comes from the other direction. Renfang is, as always, squatting by her locker, doing a hundred things with it. I hurriedly kneel beside her, hastily picking up a common topic of ours. As we engage in brief conversation, she moves past me...my mind relaxes once more. So on, and so forth...staying as far from her as possible, even if it means squinting to see the scores...talking as little as politeness requires.   I...don't want to fall in love. The bible says, there is a season for everything. I know that Eden is not near, nor the lovely Spring, and chasing after the falling leaves of autumn hardly hastes its arrival.    When gentile poets with their fictions vain,  In tragic language and bombastic strain,  speak of heroes, maidens, and dragons alike,  surely there is little truth in sight!  Love is immortal, or so they say,  yet I beg to differ, I say nay.  Stirring feelings cannot be helped,  Yet brave heart, knight! and be stout.  The end is in sight, thou doth hear.  Diligence and honour shalt prevail.
