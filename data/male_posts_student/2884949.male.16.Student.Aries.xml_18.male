I suppose that there is always MSK next year.  Man, everything, skateboarding wise, has sucked for me as of the last week or so. Cant land anything, once again, my skate team is no longer, and the skate site I always go to is currently down.. For the second time this week!  Right now, Im listening too Billy Talent. They're good. My mom was bitchin at me, once again. Man she really get's on my nerves. She's pickering about anything and everything that everybody does. If we breathe wrong, she yells. This is really starting to piss me off. Anyhow, sorry about complaining.  Im outta here, nothing else to post.  Later,  Jerry
