     
      I don't know what to do im bored, i just got back from work and i want to do something fun tonight, i have been doing the same for like three or four months i want to do something different. I'm tired of the same routine i would like just to run away and see what happens, just go somewhere else not knowing where i will be the next day, that be cool, to be like a rollingstone.
