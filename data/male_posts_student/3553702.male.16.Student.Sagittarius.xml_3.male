THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY INSTRUMENTS!!! What kind of band doesn't play ONE LOUSY INSTRUMENT?!?! And I'm sorry, one of them banging on an old acoustic guitar in a music video doesn't count! But that's not what this post is about.  This post is about one thing: the danger's of taking an algebra class while under the influence. Not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but under the influence of...BEAUTIFUL!!!  First, let me set up a little background. I've already explained Beautiful, so let me move on to why I'm taking an algebra course during the summer. Because I am fricking stupid, that's why. This isn't a remedial class, actually much the opposite. This is a college level algebra course that I took with the idea of "getting ahead" before I had to deal with it when I graduate from high school. Now that I've set up the basic background, lets discuss the class a little more in depth.  The Teacher: referred to as Sonic because he seems to frequent a certain burger drive-in, Sonic is a 24 year old mathematics professor. An OK guy, if you can get past the fact that he teaches the devil's language for a living. Sonic also has some great "guy stories", including one about the time he snapped his thumb back 90 degrees while skiing down a mountain and trying to avoid an old man. I personally would have turned the old geezer into road kill, but Sonic is the sentimental type...unless he's grading a test. Then he likes to smash people into the ground, stomp on them, then ask them to take notes on a formula of some kind.  My Neighbors: The people who sit around me in the class are all cases for their own blogs, but I'll try to sum them up in this one post.  Smasher: Smasher has some aggression issues, which he seems to get rid of by smashing plaster at his job (whatever that is). Smasher scares me a little, but he also has a funny side...that borders on verbal assault at times. He is also not unfamiliar with the bottom of bottles, seeing as his comment on refrigerators was, "All mine does is hold beer..." The scary thing was, I never doubted that statement for a moment.  Webster: Webster is a 40 year old web designer who is rather comical considering he's about 6 feet tall, almost that wide, and carries a little blue backpack that he can't wear strapped over both shoulders. Understand, I have nothing against overweight people, and that's not what I find funny about Webster. What I find funny about Webster is that he actually knows less about algebra than me, and basically announces it to the class every time Sonic leads a discussion. Its...interesting, having him there.  Veteran: Veteran is a 20 year old female who has apparently taken ALL of Sonic's classes...yet all he teaches is algebra. He teaches three remedial classes, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Algebra and Veteran has apparently taken them ALL! Veteran and Sonic are basically PAST the first name basis now, having moved on to their own nicknames...  Well, that basically sums up the people who sit near me in the class. Now, on to the TRUE point of this post. A warning.  DO NOT TAKE AN ALGEBRA CLASS (ESPECIALLY IF YOU SUCK AT IT) WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF BEAUTIFUL!!!  "What exactly do you mean by 'under the influence of Beautiful'?", you ask? Well, I'll tell you. Imagine, you're sitting there, listening to Webster harass Sonic about some formula for the third time, and someone walks by the window. Its a 6 foot tall black guy who's obviously there on a basketball scholarship. But now, he doesn't look like a 6 foot tall black guy, but a 5'9" girl of Italian/Spanish heritage and a MUCH more appealing face and body. You are, of course, entranced...only to snap back into consciousness two hours later when your class has left and Sonic is teaching the next group of victims about some horrible formula or something. You scream, throw you book at him, and run out the room. Its completly understandable.  This is, of course, just a dramatization of the horribleness of that can come from being under the influence of Beautiful. But it should be taken seriously. You never know when this could happen to you! Sadly, there is no cure, so if you do become under the influence of Beautiful, you might as well just give up. Resistance is, as they say, futile. May God have mercy on your soul. Amen.
