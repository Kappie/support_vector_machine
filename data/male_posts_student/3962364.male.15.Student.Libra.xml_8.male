Day two..sore. Thats telling you something. I had a great time this year though. Teamates of mine that came for the field player part of the camp had a sometimes dick (on the field) and sometimes cool (off the field). Turns out though, he did everyones evaluation the same way. Word for word, number for number. So the coaches were not happy about that. But im exhausted so im going to go. Later all
