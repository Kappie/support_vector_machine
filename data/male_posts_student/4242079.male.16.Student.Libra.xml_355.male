I'm sorry, you're welcome, my mistake, and thanks. Yes, sir. No, ma'am. Enjoy your holdidays! See you next week! You are invited, I am obliged, we are thrilled! Welcome inside. Open your heart, open your home, open your eyes. Congratulations, and have a good one. Get out of here - go have some fun! The baby is fine, and so is the cat. Please, before  you come in, wipe your feet on the mat. A smile, a nod, a wave, and a bow. A handshake, a greeting, so are we friends now? Hello and welcome. Bonjour, bienvenue. What a waste of time, I've got better things to do.
