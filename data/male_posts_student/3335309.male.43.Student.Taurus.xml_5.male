That said:  Enough with the shaved pubes, shaved treasure trails and bare chests.  I understand that there may be advantages to a little trim here and there ... especially the nutsac.  Shaving the balls helps to increase the sensation.  But shaving in the pelvic region does nothing to heighten sensations.  And if you believe the ol' wives tail that shaving helps to make the penis look longer, then you're missing the boat.  Despite all attempts at illusion, a 7 inch dick is a 7 inch dick.  It does not magically become 8 inches just because you shaved your pubes.  To me, it's like this weird "childhood, little boy or girl" worship.  There must be some bizarre denial of maturity (masculinity or femininity) that underlies this fad.  F that.  Why is pubic hair bad?  PS:  The irony is that the "clean shaved look" is running parallel to the whole ink/piercing body modification trend.
