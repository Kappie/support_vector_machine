How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as I floundered  unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer  and you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places  create an oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone  you leave me here burning in this desert without you   How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Everything changes everything falls apart  I can't stand to feel myself losing control  in the deep of my weaknes I know   How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Stupid. Sarah McLachlan.
