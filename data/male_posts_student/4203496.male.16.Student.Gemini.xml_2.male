     
      Welcome to my first 'Blog'. I call this particular Blog Gaming Central because, I will be talking about video games and other areas of interest (Music, Anime, Movies...) It may be a little evident that I am a large fan of video gaming, my particular favorite genres are: RPG, Action, Adventure and Fighting. So, that was my little introduction post to Gaming Central. More to come..
