It felt good to get in there and do something productive - I have been eating like shit lately. Junk food, sodas, pizza, you name it. I just get lazy, the lazier I am the more I feel American, and fuck a lot of that! Actually, yesterday I put off eating until about 10pm. I was just to busy with thoughts and stuff to even think about it.  Still no word from the mountain shadows. I am pretty sure we will find out tomorrow. It sucks because, if this falls through I have to hurry to round up a backup plan.  I got a new cell phone in the mail. My home phone is disconnected and this will be my new and only way of contact for a while. It's a super tiny Nokia 8265 but mine is black and it looks all scary. Like some little evil bug - how foreign!  I LOVE ALL OF YOU!   current mood:  cynical current music: The Album Leaf
