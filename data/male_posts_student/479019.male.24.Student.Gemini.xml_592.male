It should have been more violent though. That's just me though. I'm someone with a lot of pent of rage and likes violence.  I've done jack shit today. I've only read like 10 pages of Calvino. I did manage to make pizza dough, do laundry, and do some cleaning.  I feel a lot better now. Bessides a tiny bit of phlegm build up.  **
