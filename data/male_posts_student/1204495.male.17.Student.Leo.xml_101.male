Why are you always in my mind? my joyful thoughts surrounding the love of my life, but to no avail it appears that you no longer need me so this is the end, the end of my world. i'll move on and find someone else, but remember you'll always be deep within my heart, a small place forever belonging to the one i loved the most. How i'll miss these joyful times whcih you gave to me, i'll love you forever within my heart and my mind, you'll always be running through my mind, no matter what, i'll always be there for you
