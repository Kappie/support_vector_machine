Well, I do, but I think I need to keep some secrets of my life as what they are: personal.    And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true I needed you and you were there And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares  You held my hand when it was cold When I was lost you took me home You gave me hope when I was at the end And turned my lies back into truth again You even called me "friend"    You needed me. Anne Murray     In other matters, what a freaky day's today... Is kinda windy and there's a soft sheet of clouds in the sky that don't leave space for the sun to come through... This hurricane or tropical storm ( whatever the hell it could be... See how I'm not in touch with the real world when I'm in love ) is supposed to hit us here tomorrow Wednesday at night... Wind and rain is in store for us... We'll see what happens.
