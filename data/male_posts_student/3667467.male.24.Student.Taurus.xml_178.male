First, I turned them into the good, unpaid and ununionized folks at Wal-Mart, which required that I fill out 26 of those Photo Envelope things. I told the girl I’d be back in “about an hour” which is AN IRONIC TWIST OF FATE completely lost on her. Then she said they’d be ready by Saturday, which they weren’t. So I came back Saturday and they said “That girl CRAY-zee, they’ll be ready on Monday,” which they weren’t. Then I came on Tuesday and yes, they would be ready, but not for two hours. What to do? I looked at the (censored) CD section. I ended up buying a Game Boy game and being quite upset at myself for “wasting my money.” I then bought a Veggietales DVD, and by then my good sense nearly walked. Ninety more minutes. I decided to take a walk outside. I checked out the dollar store and then—ooh!—a discount shoe store. I bought me some sneakers for the first time in 2 ½ years and somehow felt like I accomplished something. One of the most fun ways to spend an hour and a half is “trying out” new shoes, skipping and jumping up and down and basically doing the mating dance of the dodo bird in a back aisle near the storeroom while playing with new toys like shoehorns and ankle stockings. By the way, developing 26 rolls of film costs about $200, give or take a dollar. Just enough left for a set of 20 pencils at the Dollar Tree next door.
