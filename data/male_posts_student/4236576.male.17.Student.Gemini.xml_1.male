What does he do for you that I dont? Does he know you better than I know you? Does he know everything about you? like how you eat, sleep, walk, EVERY motion and thought that you do? Why do you love him, not me? How can you hurt me when you say you love me so much? You dont believe in US do you? Do you really regret meeting me? Do you even care? That I'm sitting here writing to you and you will never read this because you dont care?           WHY DONT YOU CARE?
