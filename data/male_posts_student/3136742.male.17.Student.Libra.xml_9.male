Important Issue Essay Overcrowding hospitals, viral epidemics, polluted water supplies, gum on the bottom of your shoe, tax hikes, inflation, endangerment and extinction of species, weight loss crazes, senseless advertising, The Jerry Springer Show--- The list goes on and on. These are all problems, and all problems have a source. Many people miss the fact, though, that just about every problem, no matter what the scale, has one source. One gigantic problem can be realized as the tributary to all other problems; the overpopulation of Earth, the never-ending population boom we humans seem to be needlessly suffering through. Every problem has a source, and to totally resolve the problem that source must be changed or eliminated, and while people lazily waste their time complaining to factories for producing too much non-biodegradable waste (because it’s the easier thing to do), these Yuppie ignoramuses are directly contributing to The Big Problem. By continually popping out children every 18 to 24 months, the young couples of the world are choking Mother Earth to death with a noose made of cute little snot nosed toddlers. In days long past, before the advent of technology, couples wed for love, not lust, and had a single child, or two if they really needed the extra help, to carry on the family name, and ensure the future of humanity… Those days are dead now. This is the age of the nuclear family. Each family now consists of a man and a woman (wed in lust of course… and as they say now, ‘over 60% marriages end in divorce these days’) and at least 2.5 children. With the technologies of today, these children are not born to carry on their surname, nor are they birthed to aid their parents (excluding Amish families). They are born for the novelty of it all. Children are cuddly and cute, and for each beautiful child-creature citizen we create for this wonderful country Mommy and Daddy get a nice tax break! (Gosh, that sounds great! Where do I sign up??!!).  The Darwinian principles governing our reptilian brains, telling us to reproduce for the good of the species, have gone the way of the dinosaur in the brains of the masses, and reciprocated in the brains of the logical (those who want to see humanity survive do not have kids because they know it will, in the long run, have a negative effect on the species). With close to 7 billion people on this speck of cosmic insignificance, the most powerful country in the world in TREMENDOUS debt, millions of people thirsty and starving in every continent, the last thing we should be concerned with is creating more consumers. How little land would you say you are comfortable with having to yourself or to share with your family: 1/10 sq miles (around 600sqfeet), 1/20? Our blue planet has only 57,510,000 square miles of land, which may seem like a lot, but little of it is capable of supporting human life. But for math’s sake, let us say that the full 57.5million sq. mi. were usable, with 7billion people in this world each square mile would house approximately 12,172 people. That is about the size of a moderately large, yet still comfortable, suburb, and around 136 times less dense than the population of New York City (weighing in at about 20million people in 12sq. mi.). Since it is not possible for us to spread out like that, many of us are forced to live like tightly packed sardines, while some more fortunate souls get to spread their arms and stretch their legs, though we all share the same effects of this overpopulation. For every problem there is at least one solution. Some may work and some may not, but we will never know what works until we try. China has put limits on the amount of children its people can have, and The United States should follow. Because the lack of a half-decent reason to have children is so widely ignored throughout the states, measures should be taken to raise awareness of the fact that the more people we make the further we set ourselves back from the advancement of our species. Something along the lines of a strict mandatory Parental Aptitude test should be put into works to ensure that only the best possible parents are allowed to conceive, and no more than two children per couple that passes the test. If there are ‘accidental’ conceptions the parents must be tested and if they fail they must put the child up for adoption once it’s born (the child could then go to another family fit to support it). Drastic times call for drastic measures, and if this all sounds drastic, please do not complain when that giant moon sized space-rock comes hurtling into our atmosphere and we have wasted all our time and energy coming up with a reduced fat McDonalds menu and have no way of getting off the planet or saving ourselves.
