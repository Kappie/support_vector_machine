Anyway, he and I are going to Home Despote on Saturday to get some PVC pipe to make a Drumbone with. You know, a drumbone? Percussive offshoot of a Trombone. Someone hits one section of PVC(the reed) with drumsticks, and you have 2 other sections you can slide part of the tube up and down to change the note. It's gonna be sweet as hell if i get to perform with it. I might do pasta, or Malvinas... somehting like that. Or the talent show. That'd be sweet. Just need 2 people....  Other than that, nothing new has happened. Matt wants to make a Backpack tubulum and sell it, but im not sure if he'd make any profit off of it after what you have to spend to get the PVC, the Vacuum tubes, the frame, and the measurements right.  Wanna help with drumbone construction? Gimme 25 dollars. Just kidding. REALLY wanna help? IM me l8r (shuchomouff... duh) and ill give you the details. Then you can give me the 25 dollars.
