I sometimes just want to take a hammer and keep beating there damn scull till the brain is all over their damn computer. But then you think: nah I can't do that, its wrong.  don't you wish you lived in a world where you can do this legally? I do. It would be great. It would be unlimited freedom, and wonderful in my opinion. I'll give you an example. Some while ago I was at work and some nerdy geek came to pay for a scale model of some WWII thing. The price was 39,99 and he gave me 40,-. So I opened the till to discover I didn't have any one cent coins any more, so I ask him if he could give me one extra cent with the 40,- so i could give him 2ct back. but he says no. so i ask him if he would mind if i didn't give him the cent back,like i often do in these kinds of situations, and this motherfucker gets mad and demands his money back and goes away. Now with the laws i made up i could've just taken a pen and stabed his eyes out. but no i could't because thats "illegle".   so if you agree with me, take this challege. if somebody really dumb, really fucking pisses you off. attack them! i'm gonna try to do it too, and when i do, offcourse i'll let you all know.
