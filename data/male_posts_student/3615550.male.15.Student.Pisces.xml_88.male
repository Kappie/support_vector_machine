You can  urlLink mosey on over there  if you want to see my opinion of the song and keep up with the discussion.  And of course, you are welcome to help me out as well (though I know some of you *pokes  urlLink D2M * would prefer to stay far far away).   Well, I've got lots of grass to cut.   Be blessed!
