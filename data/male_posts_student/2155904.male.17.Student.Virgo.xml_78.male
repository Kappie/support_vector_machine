It really wasn't that bad...but Tyke knows he did poorly.  And he really wanted to do well.  But he probably did not.  After school he went home and then quickly was off to the land of Macaroon McGee.  He was joined by Amed, Kinker, Skippy, and Dr. Phil.  They started it off with some Halo but then moved outside to play some basketball.  That was a good time indeed.  Tyke has had blasts playing basketball so far this season.  Today they played 21 first and Kinker dominated the first game.  He really is a solid player and he plays hard which gives him a huge advantage.  The size and strength also gives him quite an advantage though.  But the second game Tyke should have won but he missed a bunch of pretty easy opportunities at a tip.  Nonetheless he continued on.  Well then they played HORSE.  And Tyke still owns HORSE.  Yep, he won yet again.  Undefeated in '04 now.  He just feels it.  After that Tyke went home and just hungz outz.  Of course there would be no studying tonight.  Not like that does anything.  There may be a correlation between studying and A's but that means nothing when you have a B-.  Well anyway, Tyke and Purdy talked and Ekul has been trying to get a basketball game going with good Kram and another player against Tyke and his crew of choice.  So today Tyke called Ekul back but he wasn't there so he left a message.  Tyke is teaming up with Kinker and hopefully Toxic Old (ttocS gnuoY).  That should be a pretty good team.  Tyke playing good defense and making his good passes should help out.  He can board pretty well too.  Just watch him jump.  And if they play shirts and skins then Tyke's team already has a huge advantage cuz how can you concentrate with Tyke's shirt off?  Just staring at all that man-muscle is like staring into the heart of a lion (cuz the heart is a muscle, ya know).  He is so ripped it isn't funny (that would work even if he wasn't ripped cuz if you think about it why would you laugh cuz he wasn't ripped???).  But nonetheless this part goes out to Amed, Tyke is a reall big piece of meat that should be eaten up.  Maybe with some steak sauce and you can even eat him raw.  Enough of that.  Also, another scary revelation today happened on the episode of the OC.  For all of you who watch listen up.  Ya know Oliver?  Yeah, well Tyke realized today that Tyke is Oliver.  Oliver even wrote Marissa a letter!!!!!  So really, this means nothing cuz most TV shows relate to everyone in some way.  That is why they get put on tv in the first place.  Because of the highly relatable characters.  It is tantamount to a show's success having relatable characters.  Time for a new topic.  Tyke and Oliver may be similar but Oliver is way crazier than Tyke.  Tyke ain't gonna kill himself or flaunt a gun or steal a girl from anyone.  OK, too much there.  Well tonight was fun.  Tyke has just sat around and talked and played basketball downstairs.  Watched a little TV.  Just stuff to make himself happy.  And then he talked with Haras.  She said one of the nicest things tonight about his blog.  It really made him feel great.  Just unbelievably special really.  One of those things where he knew he was doing something that was beneficial to people.  And there is no better feeling in the world than knowing that you have pleased another.  At least for Tyke.  Just to see that smile or hear that laugh or to gaze into their eyes and know that you have made at least that one moment better for them.  In this world where it often seems like there are so many stupid people and difficult choices, everyone needs someone to bring them back down to what truly matters.  It all comes down to pleasing yourself.  And for some, to please yourself you need to please others.  Just do something that allows you to see the grateful reaction from anybody.  The professional comedian must have some really great feelings.  Knowing that you go out and give people an escape from reality or just give a light-hearted view on reality has to be so fulfilling.  Tyke is sometimes too focused on pleasing others though as he has said before.  And he realizes that he may totally be contradicting a past blog but it is all about the current moment.  Live for the now and the future will follow.  Look to the future and the now will fall through (haha Tyke tried to make like a catchphrase there but it totally sucked).  Just add some levity to your situation.  Take some time out to just smile or laugh or reflect.  Music is so powerful.  It can influence moods and strengthen them.  But they can also give great advice.  It shows that others feel the same.  You are not alone.  You have support around you.  Sometimes you don't even know where it is.  But it is always there.  Sometimes it is just on the other side of a computer, or on some website.  Seek out Tyke and he will seek a way to make you happy.  Yeah, that's right...Tyke started a new paragraph.  One of the first times he has done that ever.  But he felt he needed to break up that prolonged thought.  Especially for those of you who got tired of it and needed something new.  Tyke right now though is really feeling something he is having troubles describing.  It is just like, he is smiling inside...nay, he is beaming inside.  This will make him sleep well tonight.  And he had a good talk with Skippy too.  Tonight was just a night full of great conversations.  Purdy was talkative which makes that a two-sided conversation.  And that is much better then Tyke doing all the talking.  Haras was a joy as mentioned before.  Skippy was great.  Amed, well actually they didn't talk about much.  But whatever.  Kinker has been offline for a while now so he hasn't told him his news for him.  But whatev again.  Tyke Turner.  Life is good for him right now.  School may be not good for him but he is happy.  Only one thing missing but that is less of a thought for him as of late.  Actually, not really.  He still daydreams and nightdreams about possibilities and all that.  It is something he really wants to find out there but he can't rush it or search for it either.  But he can't be down.  Friends are great too!  Tyke is just looking to find a girl that isn't taken now.  And one who isn't talking about all these guys she likes or thinks are really hot or whatever.  That gets kind of tiring by the way.  Tyke has apparently had hot friends for much of his life.  Cuz girls talk to him (directly and indirectly) about guys that Tyke hangs out with and how they are hot and how they wanna make out with them and all this stuff that is just like, "Hey whats up I'm Tyke.  I like girls.  I'm not a girl.  So don't expect me to not feel uncomfortable when you talk about guys in front of me.  And yes, I do feel uncomfortable."  Truthfully, this may sound dumb but it makes Tyke feel bad.  Kinda like he is just...well not hot.  And not that he thinks of himself as hot or anything (not that he thinks about appearance anyway) but still it is just sorta like...who knows...maybe inadequacy is the word.  Tyke is uncomfortable now.  He can't keep talking about this.  No more penetrations into his soul.  STOP!!! No penetration!!!  Good luck on finals.
