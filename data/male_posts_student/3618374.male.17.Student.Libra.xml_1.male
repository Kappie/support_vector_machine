I realise that this is ironic as most of my entries to my imaginary audience are complaints, and this is a complaint in itself, but fuck you and the horse you rode in on. Not everything has to be the exact way you want it to be. You might be shocked or appalled by this suggestion, but NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.  Staci broke my toe the other day. Totally by accident. In hindsight, it's hilarious. Even though I take even more pills than usual to stop the pain, it's funny.  Got my blood test results today. My liver function is off the map- no more drinking for two weeks. Not hard, but these damn anti-inflammatories I'm taking are killing me. Also healing me, but I question the wisdom.  Drum practice real good lately. I'm getting eight hours plus, so whoop-dee-fuckin-doo. El Chopo c'est magnifique, mon ami.
