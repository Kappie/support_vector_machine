So after about 10 minutes Lisa IMed me.  I gave her the lukewarm shoulder.  Then she asked about the "I'm confused but I'm still here for you" in my profile and I didn't want to talk about it.  So I told her that.  Then I ignored her for the most part then I left.  I don't know what I'm trying to do.  I don't want to hurt her but I do in a way.  I've tried to talk to her about how I feel but it didn't really matter.  So yeah I feel like an idiot and a jerk.  If she gets back on I'll apologize but I don't know if I want to get into how I feel yet.  On a lighter note I must agree that Stand Up by Skillet By VeggieTales is actually pretty good.
