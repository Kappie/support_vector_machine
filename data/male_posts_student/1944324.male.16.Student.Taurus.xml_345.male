All his fault, people) will go away.  I am totally in love with Tony Kushner's "Angels in America". It's a play about people, all of them flawed, living in America and either dealing with AIDS and Homosexuality on a first hand level. But despite some...bizarre content (angel sex. which is a lot creepier than it may sound. Even if the angel does look like Emma Thompson) the writing is beautiful and the play is sweeping and epic. And the angel is really cool.  I'm seeing Designing Murder* on Thursday. Is it anything like Designing Women? Is it about several white southern women who have hilarious misadventures in a large house in Atlanta? Cause that would be cool.  *Yes I know, It's "Design For Murder", but for the sake of the joke...
