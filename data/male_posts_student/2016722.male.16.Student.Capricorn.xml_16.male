We played the first two movements of Shostakovich No.8. We would've had the whole thing learned by now, but there was Italy. And with Italy came Boccherini. If his name is spelled wrong, well... I don't care too much for him anyway. Stephen's brother recorded the concert. There's only one spot where we messed up really badly, and I'm not sure how bad we messed up... its hard to tell when the speed of your bow exceeds the velocity of a car flying down the freeway. Ian's at his RPYO audition, he's probably finishing right about now. I hope he gets in, he sounds a ton better than he did before we went to Florida. I'm going to do two lab reports and a test on reaction rates, and then Ilya's Encore. Too bad Tina can't come, I hope Arthur joins us.  Florida was decent, call me if you're interested... although it was rather uninteresting. Ha, haha.  **NoAh*** lol
