Yesterday was full of surprises.   I found out that a friend of mine is getting married. Trouble is, the potential family really doesn't know what to think of her. Right now, it seems that their opinion borders more on dislike than anything else right now. This could be a potentially crazy situation. The family is in disbelief. The father doesn't even know yet. He doesn't really like her, so the potential groom is the one that's going to have to tell him. Even crazier, no one saw this coming  at all ! They didn't even act like they were really dating. I'm still in shock. They won't be getting married for a while, so we'll see what's going to happen. Will it  last ?  To be continued...   My car is driving me nuts. Last week I had them check out my car because my engine light came on. After doing a full diagnostic, they determined that the reason the light was on was because the gas cap wasn't on tight enough. They tightened it and the light went off. The problem was gone... or so I thought. On my way to class yesterday, I looked down and noticed that the engine light had come back on. When I got to my school's parking lot I took of my gas cap and put it back on and made sure it was on tight... several times. The light was still coming on when I turned on my car. I tried several times to tighten my gas cap but the light still wouldn't turn off. Maybe it's the gas I put in it? Who knows?  To be continued...
