As most of you know (especially Tomcat here who's already had one rant about it) the place has gone to hell. Literally. The fucking entrance was a goddamned cave-looking entrance. 1600s anyone? No? you suck then....Well anywho, I just stand there in front of the entrance, gaping at the shear stupidity of what what it was, Evanescence-wannabes strolling by with chains that could make their boobs sag like an old lady's ass. Not that'd I'd know of course.......stop laughing.   Well one of the store managers sees me and tells me to move along because i was blocking the customers. there was like five feet left of space in the opening, just enough for some lady with a sign on her back saying "I was Godzilla's ass in the movie" and the nearest gothic chick was like 50 feet away. I'm like "What customers? Your store sucks! I mean, i wear black jackets and pants, but come on! Have you actually shoved that many punk cds up your ass that it reaches your brain?!" Ok maybe so it was more of a remix version of that. She still got the point and sicked security on me. what security you ask? Gay dudes with ugly sticks that's what. they chased me about halfway across the wall until I lost them in JCpenny's. The only regret i had then was not taking some perfume and spraying their eyes. At least i could outrun two gay dudes who probably screw every fucking night. probably just getting old. Oh well. I'm pretty fast anyway. Outran the entire soccer team once. But screw that. I need to think a little more about that. Chow
