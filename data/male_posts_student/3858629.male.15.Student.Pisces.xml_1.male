Let me enlighten you.  I have always thought that Gerard would make a good last name, at least for me. Ian Gerard. It sounds like a clothing designer, and they always have great names. Maybe I think that way because I like to write a lot and, as all you bookworms out there will notice, author's are creative by instinct and love great names.  J.K. Rowling has admitted on several occasions that she "collects" strange names.  So, I pretend like Gerard is my last name, even though the sidebars will tell you it isn't.
