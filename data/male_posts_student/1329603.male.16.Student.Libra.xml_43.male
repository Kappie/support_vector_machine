My presents are: A camera (K-1000), from Mum; A cool Strong Bad T-shirt from Suz; A groovy Beatles: Revolver Sessions poster from Gwen; Â£10 from Dad and Denise + Dave, $5 from Auntie Chris and Uncle Frank. Thankees very much!  All in all the day has boded well. Mrs. Carden (?) at Showstoppers agreed to do Sunset Boulevard, so I'll have a solo ^_^. It's great song, as Rhiannon will testify.  Miller is apparently NOT obsessed with me. Fair enough then, I say. Although it's nice to have a good-looking blonde girl obsessed with you I'll accept that she isn't so I won't dwell on it.  Mr. S says that my poem, Freedom?, should go into some poetry competition I know nothing about. But nevertheless, it's an idea. If I can win some money by it, more power to myself, surely.  Quote of the day: "He clasps the crag with crooked hands, Close to the sun in lonely lands, Ringed with the azure world, he stands.  The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls, He watches from his mountain walls, And like a thunderbolt, he falls."  Alfred Tennyson's    The Eagle   Love, Jon Roskilly
