Today I went boating with my family and that was really fun.  My dad basically let me drive the whole time it was awesome.  My life is seeming more and more purposeful.  I just love being in God's presence and worshipping him it's amazing.  I'm hoping that everyday I live my life a lil more true to who I'm supposed to be.  I'm sick of being fake...and sick of putting up fronts:S.  I'm aiming to be totally real and just being who God wants me to...Instead of being soo stupid and being who I made up myself to be.  Right now My life is pretty distraction free soo it's pretty awesome.  I don't have any friends tieing me down...or any girls I'm likeing or any girlfriends:P.  It makes God way more accessible and makes it way easier to find time to get close to him.  I've spent soo long just at the same place:S...Like where I wanted God with all of me but there was soo much holding me back.  I was afraid of stuff and now I've given it to God.  Life's looking brighter everyday.  Idn what my future is but I know God's plans r gonna be played out. anyways:P...If u care to comment do it..otherwise w/e haha God bless ya guys cya later
