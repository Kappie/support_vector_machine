First off, it is fine if they teen models dress up in nice cloths and things like that, but when it comes to the point of wearing their panties and bathing suites that are mainly for 18+, I think it is just wrong.  The site is a top site for teenage or younger models, no nudity of course. But if my dad ever caught me there, he would think badly about it thinking I am doing it for pleasure rather then just surfing the web for fun to see what I can find and to get images to edit them on Photoshop. Anyway, the site is called  urlLink  Child Super Models  , or Preteen models as they put it. The model ages range from 10 and up, and what they say about what they wear is that compared to dancers wearing tights.  Dancers wear tights and things to show off their figure. So they say, we shall put them in swim suites to show off their figure. Okay, for those 13 and up that is perfectly fine. But 7 to 12, they have no figure yet really to show. And lets not forget, that a lot of people take sites like this pervertitaly. Anyway, do you know what I mean? I am just saying that models of such a young age should not be wearing G-string bathing suites, though the teens mainly wear that, and that the younger ones should only be modeling in full out clothing that is good for their age.  I don't know, it could be the way they have the site up that makes me uneasy about such a thing. They have it set up like it is a p*rn site or something where you have to be a member to see more pictures. If they are models, and they are under 18 then you don't need members. Such and thing should be member free because I believe that true models of this age do if for the fun and idea of being a model later on in their life. To join and have to pay for it just to see their model pictures, for one, makes it like a p*rn site, and two, just isn't right. Do you know what I mean now?  I hope you understand what I am getting at. But do say something so I can get your view on this. Sometimes my thoughts about such a thing are unsure and someone elses opinion helps to clear me up so I can think clearly and know why they are doing this.  Anyway, I need to go now. Later!
