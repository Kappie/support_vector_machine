From the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt to the totalitarian dictators of the USSR and China, power has been a leading motive in the massacres of millions of people for one ideal or another.  Imperialism was power's offspring, the next expansion of power, and the new frontier for megalomaniacs to expand into.  Through imperialism, these men gain new dominion and more subjects to dictate, and typically they are never content to just stop.  Through the ages, imperialism has held many faces, from the oppressive, land-hungry tyrant seeking even more power, to the supposedly good-will emperors bent on "helping" the world through conversion.  And, while modern imperialism had found it's new threat in the United States, it now has its new ally.    Foreign policy since World War I has steadily grown from classic isolationism, typically a staple of American conduct, to full out imperialism.  Since the dawn of the Cold War, the United States has embroiled itself in more foreign conflicts than ever before, looking to spread its own ideals and principles to the world, and eliminate the spread of those doctrines it opposed.  The United States placed itself at the forefront of a conflict with pseudo-Communism, fighting its expansion in multiple wars such as Korea and Vietname, costing many thousands of American lives, when it should have had no place in this stalemate to begin with.  Since when has America become the world's father figure, rather than its beacon of hope?    But, it hasn't stopped there.  With the recent (the last couple decades) influx of neo-conservatism, America has found itself at the forefront of more conflicts of ideals than ever before.  It has become the self-appointed wall between terrorism and the rest of the world, which could possibly end up becoming the forced spreading of American ideals and principles to the rest of the world on a much grander scale than ever before.  Soon conflicts to get revenge on our enemies in Afghanistan morphed into re-fueled feuds with sovereign countries.  The resulting Iraqi War, quite possibly the largest abomination in American foreign policy history, was fought for every excuse under the son, with new ones popping up as its supporters thought of them.  When its main reasoning, national defense, was shot down by a lack of support, and undermined by the emergence of the truth of the poor intelligence behind it, the main focus soon turned to the "freedom" of the Iraqi populace from the reign of Saddam Hussein.  Only one problem still existed: the Iraqi populace didn't support this forced freedom.    Now, what we have is America once again forcing its own ideals upon the rest of the world, even when they are not supported and unwanted.  Supporters of this form of American imperialism feel it is their right and responsibility to spread their beliefs to the rest of the world, but where does this premise arise?  Why does this premise even exist?  The best I can figure is that this arises from conceit in ones own country and its accomplishments, stemming from overzealous nationalism.  This same kind of mindset is typically found in religions that seek to spread and convert their messages to everyone else, even to those that don't welcome it.  And when looked at in this light, the thought occurred to me: what is so different between the "Islamofascism" of the Middle East and  Islam itself to spread its ideals and religion to everyone else through coercion, and the United States's policy of spreading its ideals to everyone else through coercion?  About the only difference I can see is that the United States doesn't intentionally target civilians while the radical Muslim terrorists do, and that's it.    So, how does freedom spread itself if not by imperialism?  Typically by a yearning and desire for it, making the oppressed willing enough to fight for it.  The phrase, "where there's a will, there's a way," comes to mind.  Take the American, French, and Russian revolutions for example, where the oppressed weren't forced into a revolution by an outside force, but rather by the inside insistance of the actual citizens of those countries.  I think James Baldwin said it best with the statement: "Freedom is not something that anybody can be given.  Freedom is something people take, and people are as free as they want to be."
