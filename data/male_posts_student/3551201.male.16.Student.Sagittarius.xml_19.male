Even Jimmy Carter tried, as we noted yesterday. But The American Spectator's "Washington Prowler" notes some very small-minded behavior at party HQ (second item):  In Washington, staffers at the Democratic National Committee stopped a couple of interns who were lowering the flags to half mast outside their headquarters.  "The interns were just doing what they thought was right," says a DNC staffer, who heard about the incident. "But somebody a bit more senior told them not to lower the flags until they absolutely had to, I guess when President Bush announced that all flags should be lowered. There was only an hour's difference. It was pretty petty, but that's how bad things have gotten around here."  It's kind of funny that the Dems were waiting for orders from George W. Bush, of all people. Blogger  urlLink Tom McMahon , meanwhile, raises a good question: How come there's not a word about Reagan's death on the Web site of  urlLink General Electric , which employed him for years as a spokesman and actor?
