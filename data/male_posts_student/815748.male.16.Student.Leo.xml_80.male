I'm not about to revert based on the opinion of one reader, but for a special treat, I've decided to present my rant about why I dislike Ken Zhao:  Boy, am I sick of Ken Zhao.  He begins Newton North all cocky, pretending he's going to run off for every role in Mock Trials.  I say to him, frosh rarely ever get roles, to say nothing about more than one.  He says, "I'm Ken Zhao!"  Great argument, Ken.  Then, it turns out he only runs off for one role, because he doesn't actually want to do the work, so he just BSes this horrible direct with - surprise surprise - another Asian freshman, Amy Chen.  He didn't bother to work with anyone else on the team, because he's so proud of himself that he thinks he can BS a fantastic direct without using the counsel of his teammates AND without working hard at all.  Hello, Ken, Mock Trials is a team, not a test-your-weight booth at the circus.  He didn't even learn the rules, so he couldn't answer objections.  He was just like, uhhh....  Ken thought he was above preparation.  So, shock of the century, he doesn't get the role, so now he thinks he doesn't have to contribute to the team; as I said earlier, he doesn't really get the concept that teammates are supposed to support each other, not compete with each other and then do nothing once one was decided to be better for a role.  He says absolutely nothing during meetings, has said nothing this entire year except during the direct itself and when Elliott asked him a question once near the beginning of the year (he didn't have much of an answer).  He doesn't read the case, he doesn't know the rules, he doesn't participate in meetings, and he certainly doesn't work on anyone else's examinations.  Yesterday, he didn't even come for the mandatory amount of time during the meeting, and had no excuse.  In conclusion, Ken Zhao is a lazy, cocky, unhelpful slacker who clearly attends Mock Trials for the credits alone; and he barely does the minimum, which is just to show up.  If you aren't going to make a significant contribution to the team --- or any contribution whatsoever, in Ken's case --- then don't take up space in our room or in the courtroom.
