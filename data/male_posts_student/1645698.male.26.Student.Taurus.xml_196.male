Why it would make more sense . . .I have no idea.  Life in the outer atmospheres is going along. Love and Calculus. Death and Physics. English class, the Bible, and the decay of the human brain as we know it.  Everyone should read Faulkner! (This advertisement has been brought to you by the Southerner in Northern *windy* climes.) Laters!
