Most clubs in the EPL would be happy with this position in the league but it is the expectations of the fans that has made this season a disaster. During the January transfer window, people have slammed Sir Alex for not bringing in defensive reinforcements for the suspended Rio Ferdinand. What is the point of bringing in new players when we have Wes Brown, Mikael Silvestre, John O Shea, Gary Neville with his brother Phillip Neville and the ever reliable Quinton Fortune. Who would have predicted the long-term injury that struck Quinton Fortune or the suspension that struck Gary Neville? Maybe the only mistake that Sir Alex made was to keep Diego Forlan. He should have traded Forlan for the battle-harden Gareth Southgate.     Like I said, this season is not a disaster after all because we are still in contention for the F.A Cup (at point of writing that is) and we will be able to experiment with the young players and give the new signings match experience that will be ever so crucial for next season since we are out of contention of the league and guaranteed third place. And by the way, the exit of the Champions League wasn’t our fault; it was the fault of the unreliable referees and linesmen although we should have sealed it in the first leg which we didn’t. Anyway that is all history and the future is coming.     The only thing that Sir Alex has done wrong was to tinker around with his squad and play some of the players out of position. Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes have already voiced their displeasure and I kind of agree with them. Giggs should play left while Scholes should be where he should be; that is in front of Keane and the defense and behind the two front men. United play better with two strikers up front as evident in the treble winning 1999 season where Sir Alex had Teddy Sheringham, Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole and super-sub Ole Gunnar Solksjaer at his disposal. Sir Alex should also play Louis Saha up-front more often and not waste him on the bench. You don’t pay 12.5 million euros and leave the player on the bench for nothing. ( a lesson Chelsea should learn from)     The remainder of the season should not be wasted. Roy Caroll should be given a few more games to see who should be the number 1 next season and play the new signings like David Bellion, Djemba-Djemba and Christiano Ronaldo more often so they could gain match experience and the fans should be delighted to see them play. Youth players like Danny Pugh, Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher and Chris Eagles should be played more often as well. I think all the players stated above have great talent and potential (as evident in the Carling Cup victory against Leeds) but the fans just haven’t seen them enough to idolize them like the way they idolize a Beckham or a Giggs.    Manchester United are having a cold this season just like during the later stages of last season, Arsenal had a fever. Great clubs of the past like  Leeds and Liverpool are having terminal cancer since the early nineties. Every great club has to rebuilt itself after a period of time. In the past, Manchester United was built around Bryan Robson and then Eric Cantona and now Roy Keane. Manchester United are finding its new nucleus that hopefully will conquer club-football for years to come. Every great team has a nucleus. Manchester United’s nucleus comprises of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rio Ferdinand. Arsenal’s nucleus is made up of (“ the French Foreign Leigion”) Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira. Four to five years from now, Arsenal will also face this situation where they have to replace their nucleus and only time will tell if they can successfully replace the “three stooges”.    The recruits brought in this season should not be blasted. Give them time to gel as a  team and adapt to the style of play of the league. The next season will also see a number of changes.  Diego Forlan and Nicky Butt are almost certain to leave the club to make way for Liam Miller from Celtic. Papers say that the Celtic starlet could possibly be brought in so Henrik Larson will follow suit in the summer. If rumuors are to be believed, Wayne Rooney should come in to replace David Beckham as an England icon, Fernando Torres will be the 4th striker which is what Sir Alex would like to have- four strikers in his disposal (maybe even Solksjaer may be given the axe due to his age) and a defender should come along. Propably a Gareth Southgate or a Roberto Ayala or even the Porto right-back. Not only that, a right winger is said to be in his shopping list as well. Joaquin from Betis has been a target for ManUtd and perhaps this August, he will arrive and by then Manchester United will have a player from every major footballing country except Germany. Perhaps Michael Ballack will come along. That will be nice.      Manchester United couldn’t outmuscle Chelsea, Arsenal or even Porto this season because of the Ferdinand trial, Wes Brown and Solksjaer long term injury and their return from it as well as suspensions but next season, Manchester United will be firing all cylinders led by Roy Keane who might just decide to retire next season if not the season after next. Teams beware, the RED ARMY has come to sweep you to HELL!!!!!
