It claims to disprove all current theories and state the unifying theory. Although the author calls it "the theory of everything"... even the name for the theory sucks. And what a load of shit. If somebody had actually found a unifying theory, it'd be the front page of every blog, newspaper, and website all around the globe. Nice try, bud.
