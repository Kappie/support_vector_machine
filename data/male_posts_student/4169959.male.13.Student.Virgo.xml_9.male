Jugband Blues     A Saucerful of Secrets is an awesome album with flat-out space rock songs. The first song 'Let The Be More Light' has a morse-code space message in it in the beginning. Another great song is 'Remember A Day' is a great relax song that they created. 'Set The Contols For The Heart Of The Sun' is creepy as hell and very awesome. 'Bike'  ' A Saucerful Of Secrets' is awesome with weird sounds connected to create a masterpiece. -Richard Dasher
