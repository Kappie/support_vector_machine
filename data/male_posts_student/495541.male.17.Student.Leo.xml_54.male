After watching the video of our practice, I can easily tell you I sucked.  I guess it is true you remember things in your favor because I didn't think I did as bad as I really looked.  That's alright for now I guess.  We've got about two weeks to fix all that.  Even with all our screw-ups (mine included) we're doing fine.  Anyways, today I had practice in the morning.  That was alright.  I'm kind of glad we have early morning practices.  It helps get you up in the morning.  Once practice was over, it was about 10 or so.  That's probably about when I would normally get up on a Saturday morning.  After that practice, I was wide awake and ready for the day!  w00t  Well I don't think I said anything about this yesterday, in the blog, but I made a list of 20 things to do before I went to bed.  20 things to do that were pretty easy, and pretty hard.  Nothing that I couldn't do, but nothing too easy.  I actually did 7 things on the list.  One thing I tried to do, and couldn't actually finish.  (Just so you know, it was 'get the bbs working' on my list.  Something's wrong with the BBS script and I posted on the support board on the website.  I'm pretty must waiting for a response.)  I could have done all the rest of the stuff, but I'm pretty lazy.  Also, I spent a lot of time going shopping with my sister today.  That was pretty fun actually.  We went up to Iowa City and I spent a lot of money out there.  I guess it's kind of nice that my birthday is so close to school starting because I get money for my birthday and I can immediately spend it on clothes.  This is actually the first year that I've thought about clothing.  Previous years, I really didn't think about it much.  It simply wasn't something I'd think about... because I really didn't care.  I care more now, but it's still not that big of a deal.  Everyone wants to look nice.  I guess I'm thinking about that more now.  Hmm.  Anyways that's about it for tonight.  Tomorrow I'm going to church and I'm thinking I'll try to get out to OfficeMax or something to get some stuff for school.  It's kind of pointless to go and buy stuff before you really know what to get, but you always have to have pens/pencils etc.  I probably already have all that, but no one likes to use old stuff when school starts.  You've got to have the feeling of opening a fresh box of #2 pencils and writing your name again on the top corner of the first worksheet due tomorrow morning first thing at the beginning of class.  Ehh.  That's the sort of thing I don't want to remember about school.  All the rest is great, I guess.  w00t.  I think tomorrow I'll try to do the rest of the stuff on the list.  Most of the stuff I didn't do is stuff I really don't need to do.  Just stuff I've been putting off because I can and don't have to do it anyways.  One thing I remember was that I wanted to organize an excel worksheet to record my papers so I could have an updated grade sheet.  I remember last year wishing I'd kept one updated.  I figure now that school starting, I have a fresh start to do whatever needs to be done from the start.  If that makes sense.  In other words, I want to do everything I think I'll need later, for the sake that if I remember it later and begin doing it, I won't miss it if it needed to be done to begin with.  Word.  Time for bed.  I've blabbered too much already.  Good night.
