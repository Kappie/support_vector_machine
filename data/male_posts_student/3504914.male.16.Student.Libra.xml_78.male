I find the song amusing, that’s all. I’d download it for some stupid comedy xD              Anyway, as you’ll notice on my sidebar, I support Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. For all you people who don’t use the internet very often, let me enlighten you.              ONCE upon a time, there was an evil beast named Internet Explorer. Microsoft incorporated it into Windows, those bastards. They also made you use Outlook if you had a lot of e-mail.              But then Mozilla came, and gave us a new browser. And then they gave us another called Firefox. It sped up web page loading! It allowed us to skin it as we liked! It gave us the ability to utilise nifty extensions like Dictionary Searches! And Thunderbird did the same for e-mail!              So go grab your shit today, just click on the buttons.              I was going to write an article on Writing Better Blog Posts but I got bored xD              I started on a short story today, and it’s so far called “Sin”. No more will be revealed, even though some of you may know more details on it xD              And fuck me blind, the last episode of “Race to the Altar” is on, thank GOD. Stupid reality tv bullcrap.                    Don’t mind me, my head feels like it got hit by the 5th elephant. Don’t get that joke? Don’t worry xD     Second Link of the Day:   urlLink Tunak   urlLink Tunak  Tan (Please,  urlLink click this  to understand what drove me to download the thing in the first place. They look funny don't they? And then click either of the "Tunak" hyperlinks to download the actual video. I included two different locations in case one wasn't work, how kind of me)
