Awesome stuff. Uh... Let's see... I uh... No, that was Travis and the Leaky Cauldron.  I have pretty much done nothing since my trip and recounting the details would be too painful.  I would like to tell you a funny story that I've been meaning to post. In 9th grade, I had Mr. Mahoney for Physical Science. Mr. Mahoney was kind of a dick. My buddy Siping will tell you. Mr. Mahoney used to call him "Slee-ping," despite Sipings great annoyance. He even threw erasers, covering this normally calm and reserved Asian with chalk dust.  Anyway, Mr. Mahoney stepped out of class for a few minutes, and we immedieatley decided something destructive must be done. For a while, we had been eyeing the unused outlets sticking out of the floor. Fingers were too big,and paper wasn't conductive enough. Paperclips? PERFECT. Who would be the sticker? It was more a question of who had the least to lose. I didn't want to - losing my Harvard scholarship would have  killed  my parents... It finally came to Cara Collins, or as she is better known, Cici. We didn't want Pinhead coming back in smelling burnt skin and hair, so to protect our brave Cici, we stuck the paperclip in a little book and set her to work. It took a little pushing, but she soon stuck the clip into the outlet. BOOM ZAP! THe clip burned the book around it and Cici rolled onto her back from the squating position she was in.  "WHOA!" she said. We decided mischief was better when it didn't involve near death experiences.
