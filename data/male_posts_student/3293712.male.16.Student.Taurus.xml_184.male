Shortly after one Margaret Sanger was called a whore by my very slightly overreacting pal Jetpack, Mattson slammed the statement, saying "it was the most catholic thing ever" with obvious distaste. Being, as I was, there, I took immediate offense but kept my mouth shut.      Turns out the Hobster wasn't too far off. This woman is a bit worse than anyone expected. She herself was highly promiscuous and had many lovers. She favored "free love" for women without any sexual limits but without the burden of children. She saw "the marriage bed [as] the most degenerating influence in the social order."      She was a overriding feminist. My two cents on feminism:   the movement, along with birth control and abortion, come about as a liberal attempt to give women the ability to be as sexually promiscuous and relatively irresponsible as the men they couple with. It calls to mind "Harrison Bergeron," but with a separate twist. Everything possible is done to make everyone as similar as possible. Believe it or not, men and women are different! Realistically, all men are  not  created equal; this is the logic behind affirmative action, which I personally support. Since, like the lady with the shotgun in that short story (can't remember her title), we cannot easily limit the male ability of promiscuity without consequence, we must therefore instate the ability in women as well, since two wrongs happen to make a right in this case. Unless, of course, we argue that sexual promiscuity is not wrong...      Feel free to challenge me down that deadend road.      We are survivors, gentlemen. 1/3 of our generation has been destroyed as a result of "the right to privacy." A potential best friend to any of us is dead in the name of Choice.       I'll be praying for you.
