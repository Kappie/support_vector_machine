The week has kinda sucked for me. My matteo is gone, i lost my car keys (but found them), did bad on a chem test, and other crap which is too personal to put on here.   My bro is gone, I was in waco for most of the day helping get  him settled in. A few days ago he said one of the most memorable things hes ever told me. He said "you deserve better". Basically it made my week.  I still dont have a date to homecoming, so if your a guy, and your a good friend of mine...go ahead and try to ask me ;) sorry my graduated guys, you cant ask :-P  Ross, Matteo, and Ashton- I miss yall dearly   BIBI!- i miss you too man! its not the same without my fav brown person anymore!  You know. For all of you that told me i deserved better, thanks.   well its gloomy and im in the mood for a Poe reading or something.     rock on and dont forget to wear your safety goggles.
