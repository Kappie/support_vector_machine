A penny? how insignificant, it barely matters. well, in my case, i matterd alot today. The cleats i've been telling you about, yeah, they ended today and i lost the auction by a penny at the last 2 minutes. 1 damn cent more or less determined my happyness for right now. its not meant to be? maybe but i don't really care right now. eve if i wasn't meant to have them, if i got them, i would have been happy and thats all there is to it. something doesn have to be matched up to you but if it makes you happy than you shouldn't care. whatever, i already wrote an entry earlier, i just wanted to write this one to blow off some steam by the way, the times are behind about 4 hours on the entrys, i don't know why. love always -alex
