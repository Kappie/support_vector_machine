I have now been online for roughly 5 minutes, and the current count is 13 internet explorer windows, and 2 other windows. Of these, one is my doing. The rest came from nowhere.  But that is not why I am writing. I am writing to complain about the new Godsmack album, "The Other Side". I do like this album, it's a fairly good disc, however, it is not the acoustic awakening it is proclaimed to be. When I think "acousitc", I think raw, pure music. Twangy guitars, one or two off notes, and one-take recordings. I guess my view of acoustic is different from the rest of the worlds, because this album, though good, is still very much a studio album, with obvious mastering and pitch-shifting. It sounds like a blatant rip off of the band "Tantric" from about 3 years ago. That said: Buy this CD, it's 9 dollars at HMV. Just don't expect the genius that this album has been made out to be.
