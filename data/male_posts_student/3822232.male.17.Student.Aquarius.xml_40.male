S7 had bio make-up lecture. and cos there is this story-telling competition in the afternoon, the flower pots were there and the lecture mics and projectors were removed. and.. me and jun wen had to go and help.. only the 2 of us went down and help and we had a lot to do lor.. not like normal troubleshooting, but rather.. setting up the whole system from finding the power extension. mr. haw was late i guess.. cos 8++ he was still not in school.. he is suppose to report at 8 right? or earlier? i dunno.. then cos of tt, we dont have access to control room, the sound system, the lecture mic and power extensions. thus, what we did was to go all the way to the backstage and find power extension. luckily i found it.. and sadly, no lecture mic. and the wooden cuboard was locked!! we dismantled the lock and later put it back.. no choice.  2 pts i'm quite angry abt: no other exco nor members came down to help.. hey, S7 leh.. not a small fac right? and mr. haw wasnt ard when we need his keys. and he didnt even bother to come to audi and check when he arrived? at least provide a lecture mic? his explanation was: err.. how come got last minute event? thou i dont think it's last minute thingy. at least i think ms ong did inform mrs chin abt it way before hand.  yea.. quite angry throughout the lecture. ms ong had to shout for 2 periods and i couldnt do anything without the keys.  in the afternoon my pw grp went to HPB for a forum. ha.. surprisingly we had full attendance. =) and the session was v fruitful. conducted 2 interviews with doctors, one of them was ex-HCian.. =) and we delegated the job of the report quite well too.. everyone is doing job. =)  in the evening, went to ASEAN Nite. this was a success =) glad to say tt. all the drinks, roses, dances and LOUD musics were unforgetable. i'll go next year too.. but the new com next year will organise it =P at times, i was irritated by the musics tt were TOO LOUD. and i went to lobby to rest. this happened quite frequently.. and something not *right.. other than the performance, what i did was just fooled ard with the guys tt we used to study together in CHS. had fun thou, but not from the rock dances or slow dances.. ha.. when other ppl were happily dancing, i volunteered to sell roses.. =P yea.. hope to contribute to the com too.. quite pity my partner thou but.. yea.. guess i cant do anything abt it? cos my zi4 zhi4 li4 too good? =P ha.. something interesting.. didnt know tt SCHOLARS can get so... siao~ during the dances. they seemed to be MAD.. and some of the couples.. eee~ they were... haix.. luckily MOE officers didnt see them.. did they even come? =P i doubt so.. but they were REALLY OPEN-MINDED.. ha.. was like watching movie all the time.. =P=P  back to hostel at 1++.. and now is approaching 3 le.. i guess i'll sleep after updating the blog ba.. yup.. =) tt's all i think. seeya~niteZ everyone~~~
