All I know is the water was wonderful, the people were few, the sand was white and brown and the sun was perfect.  We spent from around 1 to 5:30 there.  It's funny, each day we wake up around 9, which is noon EST, and we're getting used to it.  I always feel like we're wasting half the day, but then we stay out really late so it makes up for it.  We all got really tanned.  Aaron and Nola got really beat up in the surf, apparently they were the biggest waves my brother and his friends have seen that year.  We saw dolphins out in the water about 30 feet, which was really cool.  We played volleyball, Nola Aaron and Billy played frisbee.  There were planes and helicopters flying overhead with advertisements in pull for TV shows and movies.  It's funny, in California, it seems all the ads are for Hollywood productions.  Last night we just hung out.  A ton of people came over drinking and whatnot, but by 11pm PST, we were dead tired and we went to bed, but the party continued downstairs.  This morning Billy's brother Bobby got Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast and Mom and Aaron went to the game.  Billy, Bobby, Nola and I are joining them in a couple hours.
