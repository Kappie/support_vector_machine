That' s right kids there has been very little watching of porn today it has mostly been about the work. I have been floundering the past couple of weeks worried about how to start this essay, my SO has just said  "get on with it, it will get easier" to which I scoffed, shouted and generally behaved like the spoilt seven-year-old I hope to turn into. (I think the work is of a relatively good standard as well)  Is it smugness or is it just a sense of a job well done.  The smugness could also be a little premature, once it has been marked I may find I have only scored 2%. Which would be annoying and probably well-deserved.  Anyway, I think I have a date with some Tibetan porn. (I bet you didn't know there was such a thing)  :: trousers round ankles, and a song in my heart ::
