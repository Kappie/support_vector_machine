SIU is Division I in basketball and Division IAA in football. In this day of all the exciting athletes leaving the'Major'athletic schools before their sophmore year, Mid-majors such as SIU have had theopportunity to thrive.   In basketball,SIU is on its third straight NCAA tourney birth, as well as a sweet-sixteen run three years ago. The team is dynamic, hard-working, and an absolute joy to watch.   In football, the team is ranked #1 in the preseason Division IAA poles. The team has picked up some big-time running backs and returns a solid core from last years 10-2 team.    Why is it so fun to watch the Dawgs? 1) They are always given a somewhat underdawg status; and 2) theyjust play with so much passion. The coaching and team mentalities lead the players to give everything on every play...it is truly exciting to watch.
