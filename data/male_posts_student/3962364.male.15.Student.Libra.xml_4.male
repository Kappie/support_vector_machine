Some recent things that you might already know are listed below. I might add my input on the situations, depending on what they are.   NBA-News  -The Big Man gets traded to the Heat.-  Shaq is back in Florida. He was traded from the Lakers the the Miami Heat. Wow. Umm that is really bad on LA to do. Give away the heart and sole of the team, well they still have Kobe Bryant...wait...do they? I mean, the lakers lost Shaq and maybe losing another valuable person. Bryant may go to jail for his "Scandal" so LA will be lost of another valuable asset to the team. My thoughts on Shaq leaving LA is that it was a good decision. He is back in Florida with a very good team. Young.. but good. He should of gone back to Orlando..like that would of happend. He could of Joined Steve Francisthere were they could of been on the worse team ever. Another team(whom I think he should of went with) should be the Dallas Mavericks. He could of been what Dallas needed after losing Steve Nash to Phoenix. That still could of been the dominant team this upcomign season. But he chose the youngster team. This team, if Shaq decides to stay another year after this upcoming season could be a title shot. They can keep working and they will have a great shot the season after next. It will be an interesting season coming up. Tracey McGrady went to Houston to join Yao Ming and Mobley. Should be another great team there. Well thats all for NBA action.  Cycling- Tour de Frace  Lance Armstrong is 22 seconds behind the leader.   NCAA- football  -FSU opens up season against Miami-  Yes, I am an Florida State University fan. And im psyched for this upcoming season. It really sucks to see that my team has to open up against new to the conference Miami. I believe the outcome of this game will determine the flow of the season. FSU is being lead by Chris Rix. :'( But this is his senior year, and hopefully he has gotten better over the off season. FSU should (if they havent already) get rid of Jeff Bowden. I mean cmon! This guy is all about the Running. Have you seen Rix's arm?! Rix needs to be throwing it this season.  -Title Contenders?-  The team that has been pick by me to go all the way is the University of Georgia. I believe that it will be them because of all the starters they have returning. Wouldnt it be great if it was FSU vs UGA in the championship (held in Miami at the Orange Bowl.) Crap if that happens, I will do a road trip. Im going to that if either Georgia or Florida State is there. It should be interesting. Georgia lost only two games last season. So it should be a good year for them.  Golf- Stats- British Open  Leader-Hamilton     Baseball- Scores   NL- Expos and Braves-0-0 in bottom of first  That is all for now. Have a good day. I will do a late night blog later tonight. Im off to start packing.
