Copyediting for the newspaper, a cappella rehearsal, more copyediting for the newspaper, and an inbox full of waiting-for-replies e-mails when I returned to my room.  The Backstreet Boys song parody promised yesterday, which I know at least two people are anxiously awaiting, will hopefully magically appear shortly after lunchtime... :)  I'll also say more about moot court and course selection soon.  In the meantime, check out  urlLink Greg Lipper's Harvard Law Record column  from tomorrow's newspaper, which has a nice comment about my columns.  I don't know Greg, and I'm sure he doesn't read my weblog, but just in case, I do appreciate the compliment.
