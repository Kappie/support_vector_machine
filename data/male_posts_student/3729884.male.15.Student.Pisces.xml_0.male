Okay... so maybe I exaggerated a bit but it really isn't fun being at school. I was watching the news yesterday and I saw a segment about racial profiling. For those who don't know racial profiling is basically picking someone out of a crowd because of their race. There are many kinds of profiling from gender profiling, religious profiling, social class profiling, etc. Mr. Pedde (a man who has a blogspot, atavist.blogspot.com) reminded me in his latest blog that profiling has been happening for a very long time. It is sickening to think that anyone could just pick someone else out of the crowd as a target for their aggression, etc. just because of how they look. If the people here on Earth don't grow up and stop fighting and judging each other then I don't think the human race is going last past till the end of my grandchildren's lifetime. We need to start working together and start working out our problems without guns and violence. The thing that sets the humans apart from the rest of the kingdom animalia is our ability to see the difference between right and wrong. Well now that I'm done ranting about the flaws of our society I think I'll leave who feels the need to read a while to ponder what I have just said. Until next time salve.
