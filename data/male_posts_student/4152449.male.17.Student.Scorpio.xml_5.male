I think this says ether of two things about me; I compensate my lack of adventures in the real world by writing about my previous exploits on the internet I have become a web page making slut  Ok, my second web page might have been compulsory for Microbial and Molecular Biology, but it could be a sign of things to come. Who knows I could become the next Rupert Murdock (right now, if you don’t know me you’d be pretty confused about that last comment, but it doesn’t really matter just start laughing – no one will know that you don’t get it).  Anyway if you wondering about the title of this post, our site was called Britney Spears teaches Bioinformatics (No… his title’s and his posts are starting to relate to one another)  So far I have used 3 words in entry that will assure plenty of people coming onto my page, Britney, Spears and Slut all I need to do to become ultra popular is mention two more words; Sex and Nude.  We decided on naming Britney in the site’s title only because she is apparently the most searched female on the web but mainly Anna Kornikova was too hard to spell.  Can’t be bothered writing anymore….  Az
