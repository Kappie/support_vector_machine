Some little kid probably spent 10 minutes stitching the sole of your shoe on in sweltering hot weather, and probably got paid about a half penny for it.  The T-shirt and sweatshirt you have on were probably made in some Asian country.  Your pants, probably some supposedly “third world” country in Africa.  All this happens in a sweatshop, where people of all ages are forced to do dangerous and menial tasks, and make as much money in a week as most employed adults in the U.S. make in a couple of hours.  The view taken by most Americans is that sweatshops are horrible and should be stopped immediately.  This seems to be the one time that we take interest in anything beside ourselves.  However, that may be just what world economy does not need.  These sweatshops are revitalizing the Asian economy, and the sweatshops are moving up.  The best way to help is to buy more from sweatshops, not less.  This is not praising sweatshops, or the horrible safety conditions.  Just the way that they treat children appalls me.  But for every bad one, there is also a good one that is somewhat safe, injuries are cared for, and the pay is middle of the line, not just very bottom.  Not all sides of the story are told, just the bad ones.  And, of course, the bad ones shouldn’t be allowed to exist.  But they could be fixed.  And measures could be implemented to make them safer.  They provide a stable basis on which poorer economies can build.  And the money is desperately needed.  TIME magazine interviewed a woman in Nigeria, who had six children.  There was a bad outbreak of malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes.  She had to decide which of her children slept inside of the mosquito net and which slept outside.  But if she had been employed, even just for a day, with her wages she could have probably bought another mosquito net.  Americans boycotting Nike or Adidas apparel to save sweatshops workers could actually kill them, because it would put the workers out of a job that they would desperately need.  These sweatshops are the reason that the slow economy in China has risen, and income has doubled.  In some parts of China, there are even middle classes.  From all the misery that they create, sweatshops can also start new lives for people, and make money for kids who would otherwise starve while attending schools.  Nothing is accomplished without work.  As a Chinese proverb states, "First comes the bitterness, then there is sweetness and wealth and honor for 10,000 years."  Maybe sweatshops really are a blessing in disguise.   i do not agree with sweatshops one bit and i am very pro union, but writing this really got my mind going
