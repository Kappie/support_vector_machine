My sayang held tight my hand on the way there.. :p  Tadi pagi..went to dst gadong masa ps. Cari line easi for my sayang. Its been 1 week nda bemsg sama ia. So boring! So lonely! Usually..before tidur..ada my sayang wish me "gud nyt". When i woke up..she wish me "gud morning". I miss all that.. I MUST get her the easi line ASAP. Rindu kali ah..  Tonite..my sayang tidur d muara arah her nini. I wonder makan ka ia udah or nda.. I really really care bout her. She's my sayang, she's my life and she's my everything. Im willing to do anything just for her. ;)  Lunch d mall tadi..i dun think i need to tell the name. Sama juanya..hehe. Sangal saja menaip dorang punya nama. History class nada tadi..mr mark ada appointment. Okey jua tu wa..i always feel sleepy in his class. :p Shukri sent me to sgs tadi..malas kan ikut my dad. Hehe.  I wonder sapa kuar malam nie. I think..bob.. Hehe. Ntah ah. I just got the feeling that ia yang akan kuar. Oh yea..jazzy's going back to brunei next sunday! 8 months nda jumpa ia. He's one of my close fwen masa d st george..and one of the craziest person in our class. Haha. Jgn mare.. :p  This monday..jumpa my sayang lagi. Can't wait. I wish i could be beside her 24/7. I wanna spend all of my time with her.. Btw..tommorow..1 month dah we've been together.. Nda kerasahan. Time just passed by quickly.. Maybe its becoz i really really really really really really enjoy being with her. Yep. :)  I love u yang.. *hugs* *muahz* ;)
