Anyway, bios.  I think it'd be easier and a lot less confusing if I gave bios and codenames to call them by, instead of just saying "my ex" or "the new boyfriend" etc... so here they are.  Tree: A best friend out of four, she's helped me a lot these past few months and our friendship has gotten stronger as a result of the breakup.  She's also best friends with my ex (We're all friends in a circle kind of deal here).  Ex: The ex.  I still consider her a friend but she's done some stuff lately that's taken our friendship back a ways (She said something that upset me greatly and she proved I can't tell her anything).  Still, we try to be friends but its definitely difficult.  Gollum: My bestest friend.  We've known each other since 5th grade or so and he and I have always hung out.  My relationship with Ex weakend this relationship (I spent more time with her than him) but we're working it out.  It's taken about six or seven years but now we're talking more about feelings instead of Magic cards or TV :D.  Gollum you ask?  Well, he loves the character (so much as to the point that he imitates him...quite well.)  Lz: Sorry, I couldn't think of a nickname for you!  Come to think of it, I can't think of one you might have...anyway, Lz and I dated after the breakup for three weeks and, well, broke up (this story is for another time though).  Wasn't entirely saddening (we only dated for three weeks and we agreed that there wasn't a whole lot to be sad over) so we've been better friends afterwards than I was with Ex.  With her bio ends the people who I can trust (Gollum, Tree, Lz, and Ex, although Ex is on the fringe of trust)  SC: Standing for Swahili Chipmunk (don't ask.  I'm not entirely sure I understand it myself), SC and I have slowly become better friends just over time.  I've slowly come to trust her with my innermost feelings, but some I keep inside just because (even though she reads them on this blog :D)  PB: PB stands for Pretty-Boy, which is the name we've given this Japaneese pop star guy who dresses like a girl.  PB is a girl though and has a mad obsession with the Japaneese guy (claims he looks like a guy.  I've seen the photos and I'm inclined to disagree though :D).  Friends and not much more.  As much as I'd love to, it's difficult for me to trust her for no particular reason.  Additionally, she has enough issues to deal with that I don't feel the need to burden her with mine.  Stalker: Not a friend and not an enemy.  I thought I'd hate him with an undying passion and balmed all my problems on him when I had only blamed him because I didn't see other places the blame could go (myself, Ex, etc...).  We're not that great of acquaintences and I'd never trust him with anything said here.  The best word I can come up with for our relationship is: tolerance.  I'm willing to set aside my ideas and talk with him than I am with, say, the new boyfriend.  That's all.  NB: Standing for new boyfriend (I'd have used BT but decided against it.  Ten points if you can guess why ;) ), he's the only person I hate and everyone knows why.  I'm not gonna go into it myself, you can read the other posts here for that.   That's all the people that will be reffered to as the story of my sad life goes on.  I know I left out a few of you, so don't IM me about it :D.  These are the people for whom I might need to refer to for storytelling about the events of the past few months.  Don't think I don't consider you friends, these guys are the ones for whom there could be confusion and I'm just trying to clarify.  My sad little world has expanded into a universe now!
