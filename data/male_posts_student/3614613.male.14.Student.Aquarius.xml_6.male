He's okay, except I notice he has a lot of policies and all those "my standards for this class is..." Are we going to go through that everytime we change teacher?  It's not ususally one of those things you notice AND remember but it's kind of funny to see li lin poking the air just in front of his ah-hem with her ruler. All it needs to top it off is for someone like calvin lim to fan his behinds when he is not looking.  After lots of whining from my family, I removed the pictures of my sister. My father was going through reasons like what if people copy my sis face and paste on naked bodies or something. Yes people, go ahead, give him the -_- or the "...". They are the same anyway, arn't they? What are the chances? But I suppose he can't help it, he's very insecure and we must all be very patient.  I promise this will be the last time I involve my family, EVER. Supposing my mother will bring me to suntec in future, it shall henceforth be simply phrased "I went to suntec", unless you people probe, but I doubt it very much.  Let's see, er I did CIP today... uh, at the D&T workshop, cleaning up. It was one hour only, but then again, I have a huge boon of CIP hours, just ask any scout. And er, after that, walk home with Weijin. I was trying to convince him that he is not clever, and thank goodness I didn't suceed, which makes him a worthy friend, for I don't like the weak minded. Or at least I think I didn't suceed. Haha, well Lin, any snide remarks about how I failed miserably?  And you arh, Jean, please get my bottle tomorow afternoon okay? That ought to be it for today, and er, I decided to update old pictures that are found on my blog, unless they are really really good pictures or they are necessary for the text to make sense.
