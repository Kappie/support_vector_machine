I won't go into here, but you can ask me if you want, tho there is one thing i have to say. And don't freak out when you read it, I'm trying to get in contact with Dr. Rex and Mrs. Young and whoever else i can, so i'm taking the appropriate measures.  I don't want to live anymore. I've reached a point where life is not worth living. It simply isn't, no matter how sacred other people may feel it is(which is an opinion i do NOT share) I just don't want to exist. I'd take absolute nothingness, or maybe even what dante described as the punishment in hell for suicides over life at this point.  I need hugs, lots of them.
