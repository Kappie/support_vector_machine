I smashed the knuckle on my middle finger between a metal rail and a plexiglass windshield.  It was super.  Now I spend the next two weeks getting my scientific diver certification.  It's an intense load of diving, doing some crazy stuff that I'm not terribly comfortable with yet... but hey, that's why there's a class for it.  On the last day, we do a dive to about 100 ft and get nice and narced via nitrogen bubbles, then do math problems and see how hard it is.  So I have to do a rediculous swimming test tomorrow morning at 9 in Long Beach.  Did I mention I'm not in shape?  Plus these research trips are exhausting?  :(    Eh, they're sorta getting along.  They brawled when I came home today...  Brazil discovered that Sam can beat her ASS in if he wants to.  "Duuuuuust in the wiiinnnd." - Kansas, The Scorpions, and a bunch of other bands... oh yeah, and Will Ferrell.
