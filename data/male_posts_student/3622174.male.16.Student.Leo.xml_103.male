Isn't that funny?  Its hard to believe.  And only one more to go.  I've made a decision that I definitely want to go to UCF.  They have a really good journalism program, and I couldn't think of anything else that I would want to do after high school.  I'm going to schedule a college visit for sometime in September, after school has already started.  Come August 2005, I'll be down there at UCF.  I'd do anything to get into that school!    Tomorrow is day 1 of my driving days for drivers ed.  Nervous?  Of course.  Me and Alex are terrified.  I have no idea how to conquer this fear, other than to wear my sunglasses and fall asleep during the day when I'm not driving.  The next two days are going to go by very, very slow, I'm afraid.  We drive from 8-3, and I'm gonna be at the school at around 7:15, since mom has to get ready to close on the ol' house.    There's not going to be late night bloggin' tonight.  I feel the urge to get to sleep.  Right now.  I have to get up at 6.  So, I'll have an "Early Morning Hope I don't Die Today Bloggin'" post.  Haha.  Just kidding.  I'll post something in the morning though.  Until then, conquer your fears, don't be scared to drive, and don't be a coward.  And that is your advice for the day.  Enjoy.
