Despite my ambivalence regarding feeling patriotic, feasting on great salads, hamburgers, and ice cream sundays made any inner turmoil feel all better again.  The second barbecue I attended was hosted by a couple from my local Friends meeting. Many members and attenders were there to share in the food and viewing of the city’s (both legal and illegal) fireworks high up in the Baldwin Hills.  After the fireworks had ended, several Friends started a conversation with me about the Bible study and worship sharing group that I had started about a year ago at the Meeting.   I use the  urlLink Friendly Bible Study   format that is ideal for a Meeting of liberal, unprogrammed Friends. About ten years ago I had been introduced to it at the previous  urlLink Friends Meeting  that I had belonged to before transferring membership to my present Meeting. Initially I had been leery of attending given that I had a ten year history of involvement with Christian fundamentalism from mid-adolescence until I was about 25 years old. My participation in the group was surprisingly very rewarding. Suddenly, I had a new approach for reading and studying the Bible that included an opportunity to struggle with my understanding of what the verses meant, any new insights gained, as well as any difficulties or outright offenses I might have with it. It helped to be introduced to this approach with a group of Friends who were comfortable reading and studying the Bible together, and who also role-modeled how to depend on the Spirit’s guidance through the entire process.  I have attended the present Meeting I am a member of for about five years. It is decidedly more  urlLink universalist  than the previous Meeting that I had belonged to. The positive thing about this is its efforts to be very inclusive to individuals who have been hurt by other religious institutions. The negative side is that it can inadvertently be antagonistic towards the Judeo-Christian (particularly the Christian part) tradition. Thus, when some Friends and attenders found out about my background with the Bible and had expressed an interest in doing a Bible study I was both surprised and hesitant.   I felt lead to seek the guidance of the Meeting’s  urlLink Ministry and Counsel  (M) as to whether the Meeting felt a desire to support a Bible study. M was very supportive, although the only self-identified Christian in the group made a point that the Meeting should not limit itself to the Bible, but to other holy books. I said nothing at the time, but disagreed with this assertion because of the foundational nature the Bible holds for Friends versus other holy books. I found it odd that the self-identified Christian should assert this; it seemed almost as if it was an apology to the others, as if it were a way to “prove” that us Christians aren’t so narrow minded after all.  So the study has been going on for about a year. Those who have regularly attended are pleasantly surprised. A few who clearly treat the Bible as literature and metaphor, which I do myself in some ways, have contributed the most. Each of us is gaining a bit more understanding on how early Friends found the Bible to be a resource and guide for their faith and practice. We’ve also noticed that any insights that do come up tend to be much richer and satisfying when done as a group versus what any one of us as individuals could do on our own.  Back to the Friendly barbecue – as stated before I was approached by several members of the Meeting regarding the Bible study. One of them paused, and then asserted, “I have to be honest…” I knew, then, what was coming. The conversation turned into the merits of the Bible (“isn’t it all just a matter of personal interpretation”; “hasn’t it been used as a way to oppress others”) and of having a Bible study in a Friends’ Meeting (“but, early Friends didn’t believe in the Bible”). In fact, one member stated very clearly that having a Bible study was wrong.   None of their concerns were a surprise to me; I’ve had many of the same myself. What did surprise me was how long it took members to finally approach me with their “concerns” (a Friendly euphemism for being in complete disagreement with another). They seemed to be taking the Bible too literally. Yet, instead of treating it as the infallible Word of God, they were treating it as a reprehensible treatise that resulted in the moral and ethical failure of millions of people! Afterwards, I found it interesting that none of these individuals had yet come to one of the studies (although one person has internally struggled to get there). And it wasn’t as if any of them were new to Quakerism; some had been involved with the Religious Society of Friends (RSoF) much longer than I had.  But, these “concerns” highlight some of the major problems and failings that I find for those of us in the liberal camp of Quakerism (at least in the U.S.). We have very little to no knowledge of the Bible, other than the “throat cramming” tactics of rabid televangelists or simplistic and prejudicial assertions of those who have, for various reasons for which I can sympathize with, left Christianity for its oppressive institutions and bloody history. It is true - Christianity has a horrid past of bloodshed and oppression. When I was attending a fundamentalist church I was taught some of the very theology that could prompt such behaviors; and I have struggled to wrest myself from it for many years.   Nonetheless, I came to one major insight while participating in the Friendly Bible Study group at my former Meeting. How did Friends come to such different conclusions (e.g. gender and racial equality, the Light in all people, pacifism, community discernment without the need for ritual or a professional clergy) when much of Christendom had come to the exact opposite conclusions? Yes, I’m aware that the Bible has its contradictions. In fact, it has tons of them! But, that wasn’t what grabbed and held early Friends. It was their direct experience of God, without the benefit of an official liturgy, professional clergy, and official doctrinal statement. And yet, they found their spiritual experiences and conclusions mirrored and confirmed in the Bible, the very book used to support all sorts of wars and subjugation of all sorts of people over the centuries (including early Quakers!).   I doubt that I changed any minds during our lengthy, but respectful conversation. But, unlike what seems like the opinion of the majority of liberal Friends, where personal and corporate revelation is the sole arbiter of faith, I believe that individuals and groups need far more than that to keep us from deteriorating into a “least-common-denominator”, sentimental faith that tries to be all things to (most) everybody (as long as they agree with our politics). I believe that Friends have a rich history to draw from, which includes our present Faith  Practice (along with past F’s), the writings and testimony of previous generations, and (hold your breath) the Bible. I have limited experience with  urlLink Conservative Friends , but this seems to be their approach on things as well, because of their respect for their Books of Discipline (both past and present), their respect for the traditions of Friends that make them unique from other Christian and religious groups, and their respect for the Bible as another albeit important and even fundamental source of guidance.
