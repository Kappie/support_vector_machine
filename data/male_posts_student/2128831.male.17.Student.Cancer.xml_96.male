So if I am ever admitted to some self help program I am gonna have some fun with it. (Enters Will) Howdy yall, my name is Will"yum" and well… (Twirls hair) Tehe, hey you are a massive cutie there.  (Walks over and stands and then bends to be two inches away from the man’s face) I can’t stand to not have sex.  (Sits in man’s lap)  What do you say cocktails after this?  The cock can be yours and I’ll be the tail.  (Strokes his face) Tehe, come on you wanna… 	I got an Easter basket. Very creepy if you ask me.  I am 16 yall know.  I love candy and jelly beans, so this is a horrible holiday.  I am three pounds more then this morning and I am still going at the candy.  I hate the Easter Bunny; don’t tell me he isn’t real because you would be wrong.  And I have to end this grudge against him and so I have decided if I ever see the Easter Bunny that Papi and I will have our ways with him.  I wanna know if he likes cream filling.  I wanna show him once you have anal you don’t go normal.  Lol, Papi seems to like the idea of if he likes carrots so much, let him try something else to have in his mouth.  Sorry for the little children reading this… but I am merely thinking of the horrible time I will have trying to lose this candy weight. 	On another subject I have been able to convince a couple of people that I in-fact have received the wounds of Christ.  Yes, intentionally, but I have. You see I was back in the woods cutting down trees and splitting logs to fill the woodshed and one of the trees decided to fall the wrong way and fall hitting and knocking me over.  Well needless to say my leg looks as if I was attacked by some badger, or if you have seen the “Jesus Chainsaw Massacre” or “Passion of the Christ” those names are interchangeable, quite similar to the beginning flogging.  And when I fell my left hand was impaled by, for a lack of a better word stick.  It went all the way through and bruised the back of my hand, barely breaking the skin.  So, when I was writing in class one day, my hand started bleeding all over my paper, not a drop, drop bleed, but a steady pour of blood.  So, I am waiting for the next wound of Christ… I will keep you updated of this developing story… Will the teenage stigmatic.     Is there a cure for this disease? I AM SICK... of having the urge every hour to get on the internet to be fed useless information. It is truly a disease ... Of helping to fuel this consumer-driven society, where flash is more important than substance.  ... Of hanging around people who have no substance to their personalities, whatsoever... of constantly being let down. ... Of being made to feel stupid. I LONG. ... To find solace within me. ... To find happiness through things you cannot touch, see, hear, or smell. ... To be content. ... For quietness. Sometimes death doesn't seem so scary. I WISH. ... That I could figure out exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. ... That I didn't have to ever worry about money, again.  ... That my parents didn't have to ever worry about money, again. ... That my sister and I didn't have so many fights when we were younger. ... That I could be a more patient person. ... I could be altruistic throughout the ENTIRE day. ... Sometimes, that I could go back and choose the "blue pill", living obliviously among the rest of the lemmings in this world.  .. That I had more friends who chose the "red pill". If you've read this far and are still awake, answer this:  If presented with an opportunity to choose the red or the blue pill, which would it be and why? USE THE COMMENT SECTION   My consumer lash back for Papi From: hcooling@hardwarecooling.com  Good Evening,  This email is in regards to the 2 port PCMCIA Firewire card we sold you. We wanted to know what you like and dislike about the product we sold you. If you had success or were un-successful getting the product to work we would like to hear from you. When you reply please be sure to specify the model laptop you are using, operating system and firewire device(s) used.  Thank You in advance.  Tom  HardwareCooling.com   Hello, "Tom".  I'm actually quite happy to hear from you and your company about the firewire card [read: "lemon"] you sold me. Some quick info: I use a Dell 4100 Laptop with a Pentium 3 processor and 256 mb of ram, which is running on Windows XP. The performance of the card has been nothing short of shotty. When transferring files between my laptop and iPod, there is consistently an error that pops up saying that the transfer was interrupted and could not be completed, when nothing was done to induce such a prompt. The result is that sometimes my files get transferred, whereas most other times it does not. I think the casinos give me better odds in Vegas, Tom. I happily took back a premium firewire card that worked due to my finding a very inexpensive card on your website, which I was referred to by a friend. Well, it's safe to say that he's no longer a friend of mine.  I guess the lesson learned here is - if it's too good to be true, it probably is. And as a law student, I probably should have known better ("caveat emptor" = let the buyer beware).  Needless to say, I am very unhappy with the quality of this product. Consequently, I take it as a reflection upon not only the quality of the products your company provides, but the quality of your company in general. This experience has influenced me not to purchase any products from Hardware Cooling in the future. Hey, like the saying goes, "you burn me once, shame on you. Burn me twice, shame on me".  Sincerely,  One unsatisfied customer ME  Ahh, poo so my father gets a new laptop soon, don’t ask me when, but now we share this computer.  His company is gonna purchase him a new one. So I have to sure this one…
