The new band is doing pretty good, we have had two practices and have about 4 songs in production.  BY the way, the new band is me, marty, mike and brandon, and it is a ska band.  I am happy I am actually practicing once again and feeling motivated, and writing songs.  We can't decide on a good name though, some are:  -Peeping Tom and the Private Eyes (me and brandon like it, marty will accept it and mike doesnt like it)  -Four Fingers and Their Time (FFATT) This name can be taken many ways, i like the fact it spells out FFATT so people can just say fat.  I know Marty likes it, and I am ok with it, but I am unsure of mike and brandon  -The Corporate Skulls- Name of Marty's old band we can use.  I like it and the icon is cool (skeleton with briefcase, tie, and hat running)  I dont know who else likes it  Those are the major ones anyways.  Still unsure of what to go with, if you have any ideas or anything, you can talk to us.  We practiced today, so i feel accomplished.  Kate wont pick up the phone :(  but i bet you dont care.  Bye  "Stretch my wings to fly, you can fall on me." -Before I Go (Good name and the letters form BIG heh)
