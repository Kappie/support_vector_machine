Unfortunately, although I listen to the teacher, I am not to adept at studying.  Thus, I am quite good at grammer, but am horrible at vocabulary. -.-* *sigh*  Afterwards, I went to Rei-chan's house! ^-^ Yaay! Watched movies with Rei-chan and Mishi... um...   Austin Powers in Goldmember  Half of Monsters Inc.  Half of Ice Age  Three Quarters of Scooby Doo  And the first half of Rush Hour 2    I fell asleep during Scooby Doo... saw it many,  many  times (on account of my sisters' obsession to overwatch movies), and I was  soooo  tired.  -.-   My sister bought a bunch of 3D Puzzles ( P uzz 3 D is the brand name...) and she's currently working on an Aircraft Carrier. The  USS Nimitz . I was helping earlier... but I think a lot of the pieces are missing - She got the puzzles used...  What else happened today... it was kind of busy... Oh yes... Now I'll talk about school!   Yes, I know, I'm not writing chronologically...  *blinks* And I'm using a lot of italics.  Woke up at 8.30 am. Which isn't good since school starts at 8.30 and it takes an hour and a half to bus there. After a quick, and I mean  quick  shower my dad dropped me off 45 minutes late. Good thing Mine-sensei didn't start the exam until 9.30. -.-   We had the test during first period... fun. During the break I played speed Go with Von. She says I won, so does Chronos. I disagree. While we were playing I could hear people around me murmuring "Chinese Checkers." Geez people! It's Chinese  Chess !!!! Wei-chi Chess to be exact... but we play by Japanese rules. ^-^  Second period the teacher taught us out of the text book. It's actually quite good for grammer. When school finished, I had to  shamefully  ask Rei-chan to pick me up so I could go to her house. -.-* But it was worth it, even just to see Rei-chan but 3 days early!  Oh yes! Rei-chan's coming to Mary Ward on Wednesday with Jade! That'll be interesting...  Well, until next time! Oyasumi Nasai!  -ArV
