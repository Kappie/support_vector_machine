It was a good sail too, nice and fast, although my shorts kept falling down. Ho hum. The water was quite warm, and we only capsized 4 times, Penmo geting through 3 of them without getting wet except for his feet, and I did the last one, without getting wet at all. It was good.    On the way home we bought some skittles, and I had a haircut. Yay! It's all short now. Or shorter, anyway.
