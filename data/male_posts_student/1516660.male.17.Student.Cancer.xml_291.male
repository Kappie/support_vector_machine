Actually, yesterday, I completed my Transfgiuration homework. Today leh, I done Divination, Potions and History of Magic (which I have to trim to 3 paras...my wonderful essay!). Tomorrow I am doing COMC (which is to write a story. Coolies!) and DADA (which I am considering doing if I have time later).      Meow moo! WQ came online too. In the afternoon, I played my FFX. O.O! How meowful! Even ducks meow! Such a fun game! I stopped at the part when I am finding Auron.  After that, I went online. Then, I bathed at 6+, ate dinner and came online. Hmm. Later, the Group 2 results will reveal. This group is very sucky compared to the other group. Very lacking in star quality. Oh well.    I think I end le. Do my DADA homework. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
