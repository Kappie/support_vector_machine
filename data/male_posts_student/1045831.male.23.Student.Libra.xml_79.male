So when we went out Friday night and met this girl Larimie who was pretty cute and definately ready to go home with Paul. (I mean she called him later that night at like 2:30 to see what he was doing).  I encouraged him to bring her home with us.  We would beat Kristen home and he could go in and hook up with Larimie in Kristens room.  So when Kristen came home from her "Date" I could say (with a straight face of course), "You shouldn't go in there Paul's with a girl."  I think that would have made my whole Weekend worth it.  Even the sleeping in the car that would have had to have happened the rest of the weekend. Also I don't know if I put this in the story but Kristen has started to question whether she is going to law school anymore.  NOw I really like Kristen, she is a fun girl but I'm seeing a trend.  Dating a 31 yr old, deciding not to go to law school yet sticking with the fake breasts decision.  Something seems to have gone very wrong down there in the Lonestar State.  Hopefully Kristen will return to us with the same fun and sanity that there normally is in this girl.  I mean doing shit like this sounds a lot more like me than someone fairly rational.  Ohh well  it could definately be a soap opera for everyone to watch.  Thats my 2 cents..  It's late.. I'm tired..  I love you all but I'm out..
