The striker beats his marker, Costinha, and the Portuguese goalkeeper to the ball to power his header home from the corner. - the description of the goal. Ronaldo and Ricardo fail to deliver. Unable to see the match because of preparation for presentatoin but when the net is near nothing is far. Will try to catch the finishing glimpses of the match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
