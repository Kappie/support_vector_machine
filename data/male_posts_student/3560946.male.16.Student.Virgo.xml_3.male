I finally have a Blogspot account I can   log in to, which is "trxon". BUT, I notice I am not listed as a contributor, so all you have to I   guess is add "trxon" to the list. Whenever I click on "Post to this Site", it just takes me straight to   my blog control panel, which has nothing to do with the Lavalon blog.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------ ON THE NEW ACTS:  Also, I would like to announce that I HEREBY DECLARE the following   drafted acts as Acts (actual law):  1. The Cultural Enhancement Act. The full text of this Act, which has   been modified from the earlier draft and is /now/ found at a different   link, is at the following address:   http://tbctv.3321871.tripod.com/cultureAct.html .  2. POTA, the Patents, Ownership, and Trademarks Act. This Act's text is   found at the following address:   http://tbctv.3321871.tripod.com/ownershipAct.html  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  ON THE WEB SITE SITUATION:  You will notice that both of these Acts are hosted, temporarily, on   space I have donated to Lavalon. Until I gain full access to this blog,   I would like for someone to change the link for the Cultural   Enhancement Act to the tripod one. Unfortunately, Tripod is now my only   web server because the free ones I get by "knowing the right people"   always go offline after about a year (such as expunged core, which   won't let be log on with FTP).  The Blog is a very excellent resource for Lavalon. However I realize   that blogs alone won't keep Lavalon alive long term, and a real website   is necessary. So I will be investigating the possibility of purchasing   a domain name for Lavalon and finding some better web space. At least   from that, we can have a simple portal web page directing users to the   Blog or any of the old forums that we have or the New Forum that I hope   will come soon.  If anyone has ad-free hosting with FTP access and one would like to   donate a portion to Lavalon, that would be excellent. Just contact me   at mrtn332@mail.ru . I do not live in Russia.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  ON ACT PUBLISHING:  All published Acts, except ones that result in a veto override in the   General Assembly (as the Executive Branch cannot dictate the form of   those Acts), shall from now own resemble the two Acts that have been   approved today in these specific attributes:  1. Background must be blue. 2. Flag. Lavalon flag must be displayed somewhere on the page. 3. Text must be white. 4. Abstract. This describes the document's overall structure and goals. 5. Text. Text should be in a separate section and, preferably, have   some sort of hierarchal formatting of its elements.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------  Regards,  Xon
