We saw Napoleon Dynamite. aimee and i liked it but marty and amber didnt. I thought it was really goofy and funny, and reminded me of high school.  Afterwards amber drove us back to aimee's house and then she left to take a nap. Meanwhile we went to blockbuster, and got Gothika despite aimees strong dislike of scary movies. Amber showed up back at her house and we watched it.  I barely pulled off getting home at my curfew, but it was fun. Just to prove to you how  hot  it was, here is a very nice pic taken via a picture booth thing at the movie theater    urlLink    Marty and I going into uncharted territory...  urlLink     Can you feel the  love  tonite?      Man, if I have a tumor or something growing from that spot or like a rash....well...then i know where that came from...
