The Czechs came back with their first goal just four minutes later. The rest of the first half continued in high pace and good opportunities at both ends.  After an hour, Dick Advocaat made the same mistake as the Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni made against Sweden substituting an attacking player for a defensive one. This time it was Paul Bosvelt who replaced the flying dutchman Arjen Robben. This allowed the Czechs to take control of the match and naturally, in the 71st minute, Milan Baros scored a wonderful goal from outside the box.  But the Czechs wasn't satisfied, they managed to scor a third goal just two minutes before full time. Netherlands, then reduced to 10 men, tried to find the equalizer on stoppage time but came never close.  My Man of the Match: Edgar Davids.
