The most I ever had was a short crush on girls, but then again, it only lasted a shortwhile... actually it's over between us already, without it even getting started... then along came a friend who pretended another gal like me and stirred up my emotions again... well, it was just an innocent joke, and he never really meant to hurt me, so I won't take any offence against him, although I honestly think jokes about emotions should be banned....
