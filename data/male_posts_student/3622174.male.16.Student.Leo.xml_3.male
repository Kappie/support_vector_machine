This game will make you develop Clickeritis, especially in the later levels, because you have to obsessively click to clear the board.  In Collapse, your job is simple, and that is to find matches of three or more, click on them, and eliminate them.  Sometimes, you'll get bombs, which help you clear the board a little bit easier.  The standard bomb will eliminate all blocks within a certain radius.  Color coded bombs get rid of all of the blocks of that color.  They are helpful, yes, but, does that really matter?  Of course it does.  This game is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  And that could be taken as both a positive thing, and a negative thing.  You click, and click, and click, and click, so much, that it's hard not to develop some kind of arthritis or something.  And you just want to keep on clicking, even after you've finished playing the game.  But, the game is fun.  Lots of it.  It's a single player game, but, you can take turns with friends every other round if you want to, to avoid the pain of clicking too much.  But, will you want to share with your friends?  No, because the clicking in this game is so freakin' addicting.     urlLink    Ah, Collapse. Game of much clicking. Easy to use interface, great sound, and lots of fun. urlLink     Collapse's interface is nice and simple, so it loads quickly on your computer.  Sounds and stuff are what makes this game pretty interesting, because the siren that goes off when you only have a few lines left is so annoying, that it makes you want to keep on clicking.  Now, I'm not sure whether or not they intended it to do that, but, oh well.  It did it anyway.  Overall, I would think that Collapse is one of the more addicting games out there, but, how does it compare to Zuma?  Well, that will be found out during bagel.tech Wars sometime next week.  But, for now, here's your detailed review for Collapse.   Pros  +Addicting +Fun to play +Great Sound   Cons  -No Pause button -You click so much that clickeritis is developed.   Score  Fun Factor: 5/5 (100% on New Scale, starting tomorrow) Graphics/Layout: 4/5 (80%) Speed: 3.5/5 (70%) Customization/Controls: 5/5 (100%) Final: 4.5 out of 5 (exact would be 87.5 in this case)
