Then after that I went to my cousins for the super bowl. That was loads of fun. I played with my cell phone the whole time but it was fun. Basically I had no preferred team but after a while I chose the Patriots considering they won the year before or whenever and were seeming to do better than the Panthers. Today was nothing great except for lunch which sucked...because there's now a million people that idolize me and my friends, haha no it's just that they're friends with us but there's too many of them. I guess I'm saying I have alot of friends. It's true. I'm a friend magnet. No, really I don't know why they're sitting at my table. Actually I like em all, it's just this Billy Davorak that pisses me off. First off he stole our seat, where James is supposed to sit which screwed James which screwed Heaton. So we revolted and kicked him out to the other side of the table. So now Gallentucci is gone (sobbing moment) and it's now Heaton, James, Adam, Matt Kaiser (NEW!!!), and Rich. And on the other side of the table it's Nolan, John, Paul, Billy, Jason... and Jared left. Also Keith and Michelle stand up next to us and just randomly discuss. It's funny but I like it. Please, persist. Ok so nothing else happened today. Now I'm doing the little amount of homework I have and listening to Korn!!!! AAAAAAHH!! RAGEE!!!! Haha B. Anyways, soon I'm gonna drum for a few hours and go all out because I have lessons tomorrow. Blue or pink?
