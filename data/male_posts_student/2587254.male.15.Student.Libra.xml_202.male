Today after 4 hours of badmintoning at the UCC, I finally can post some wins in my record =). So yeah today mostly consisted of badminton for the evening, SCing in the afternoon, and some PS2 when Gavin came over. So all in all, not a bad day =P.  The day of course started in the morning around 11 or so. A phone call woke me up, though mom picked it up so I just went downstairs and started drumming. Due to poor coordination though, I decided to stop and SC with Gavin and Josh for a bit. Afterwards, more drumming, ate, Gavin then came over, played some REALLY rigged games of NFL Street *he managed to beat me 3/4 times* then Badminton.  I'm to lazy to expand on those subjects, So I leave you with that. And this...  "How much sword could a swordchuck chuck if a swordchuck could chuck swords?" - Fighter from Nuklear Power.  Later.
