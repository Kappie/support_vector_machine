"these odac ppl, run so fast oso no use, in e end oso slack arnd while others do grandstand." it was spoken by my very own classmate, when he saw me and yy doin dips instead of grandstands after aggravating our injuries during e earlier run. it cut me real deep. i anticipated tt when a fellow classmate and odac member went up 2 jason liu after seeing both of us do tt. e reason? flu and phlem. i feel very ashamed for tarnishing odac's reputation when i pulled myself out of doin e grandstands. now i feel even more ashamed for havin brought in this wuss into odac onli 2 let him tarnish e reputation further. forgive me guys. i promise it wun happen again. cannot oso muz can.
