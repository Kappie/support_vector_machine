To think we used to swim in that when we were younger... that water's nasty!     urlLink    This is just a closeup of the cherry tree... for something different.  I think I might use it as a background for my desktop.     urlLink    Cherries ripe for the pickin' on a tree in our yard.     urlLink    And fresh strawberries, too! urlLink
