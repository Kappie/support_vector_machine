Wow, she said that i'm nice and a good student, anbd everybody heard, i got embarassed, but that was good to hear, and the other one, i'll have an interview tomorrow at 8:00 Am, cross your fingers and pray for it to be good and well paid. And that was on a good day, i have 3 physics class and one of chemistry.  I really want a job! I need one!
