Donald Rumsfeld #6. Colin Powell #7. Condaleeza Rice #8. President Bush Sr. #9. Arnold Swartzenaggar #10. Gary Coleman (thanks for trying little guy)  Other than that I have nothing to post on really... OH wait! you could check out my profile because I just jazzed it up (hyperlinks and everything baby!) so look at it... its good.  Guud!  Oh yeah the music awards were on the other night.  Outkast was great.  They got up there and said "I'd like to thank my family, God, and the Waffle House." and I was like "DUDE!".  It was funny.  And then Rick James got up there and when he walked up stage he didn't see a camera guy following him and he walked up to this random lady and said "I'm Rick James Bitch!" and walked away.  It was hilarious!  Anyway thats all I got.  TTFN  Ta Ta for Now Benton English
