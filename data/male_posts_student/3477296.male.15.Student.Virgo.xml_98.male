Anyway today I went to the beach...to do some research for my geography assignment. Thanx to Yi-Long, Jack and Ken for coming. It was pretty good, we took (well Ken took) lots of photos. Most of them had nothing to do with coastal management but meh. Handed out some surveys to some residents of Collaroy. One old man, who was very friendly told us about recent developments in coastal management (Did you know there are concrete pyramids 7 feet below the sands of Collaroy? Laid down as tank traps against possible invasion during WWII) Saw Harvey, who was also doing geo assignment. Had lunch, watched a movie (mean girls) and then went home.  So remember keep the blog alive.
