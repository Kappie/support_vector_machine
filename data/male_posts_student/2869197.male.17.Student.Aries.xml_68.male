This is important. For years, I would wonder at people for loving certain Bible verses. To me then, all verses were equally interesting and teaching. Now I see. This verse is my life. I do (addictions, temptations, fooleries) everything I do not want (God's way). It is also exemplar of me as it is theologically tasty. The idea of sinful nature being imposing itself on one is intriguing.   There are Macs here. I did not realize this before, but I am a hardcore Microsoft addict. Bill Gates is my homie. I look upon these lesser computing devices with disgust. They are cute and cuddly, what with their white cases, easily moving screens, shaded icons, and other burning figures of evility. The accursed apple, partly bitten, reminded me of Snow White's poisonous delight. I hate how they focus on appearance and lessly on functionality, sacrificing user capablity on the plush teddy bear altar of appearance. I admit they crash less (if you can find the freekin button to start the demon-spawned creature), but at least Windows is cruelly straightforward with your crashing. The Blue Screen of Death is quick to arise. With Mac, it just keeps trying, like the little engine that could(n't).  There is a arcade here. The prices were dropped from 50 cents to 25, so I get double the playing. I'm becoming hooked into a game called Metal Slugs 4. It's a beauty from my past, or maybe my distant recollections are of an earlier version. Anyway, this game is sweeeeeeeeeet. I go now to play. See you later I will.
