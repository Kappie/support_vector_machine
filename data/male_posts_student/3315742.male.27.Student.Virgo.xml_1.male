Whatever the area you wish to develop self-discipline in, such as exercise, eating right, frugality, punctuality, whatever, start small. Take eating right for ie. You wouldn't immediately start by spending $50 in the produce section, cooking up a storm,  determine to eat that way from then on; it just isn't practical. Set little goals like no more mayo. It may seem too easy @ 1st to make much of a difference but this is where the rubber meets the road. Stick with it, then set another little goal, H20 instead of pop. Then bigger, no more fast food. Get it? That's how to develop self-discipline.
