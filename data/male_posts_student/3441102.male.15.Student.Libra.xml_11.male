I'm the bassist in a band and if we can't find anyone else the singer (well joint with david). We are ok and have a total of one complete song (minus lyrics for verses 2  3 i'm not sure if we're assing with a chorus) and we have two others in the form of bass and guitar riffs  but nothing solid and the god chris (our damn amzing drummer) hasn't put anything to solid to yet. Can people please tell me if "Scitzo Facto" or "In The Flesh" is a better name for a band. You may be able to tell I'm in a better mood and I am I just woke (insomnia is a bitch) and I'm bored so good nite and good day all
