You agreed.  Yet, when I look at myself at a mirror, I don't feel like I am a beautiful person, I feel like some sort of monster inside; I don't feel like I am charming, I feel like I am popular yet despised; I don't feel any better, I feel sick.  What could I do to make you love me  But let me still be my own self? What could I do to make you love me But let me feel beautiful in my own way? What could I do to make you love me But let me keep everyone dear to me?  All of a sudden, You turn your back at me and walk away. Anger and hate surround you, What have I done to make you feel that way? I never meant to hurt you, Nor did I do it to make you hate me. I just wanted to be myself.  Then I realized something I should have seen, Realized what you have been doing, Realized what you were planning. You wanted to change who I truly am. You hated who I really am.
