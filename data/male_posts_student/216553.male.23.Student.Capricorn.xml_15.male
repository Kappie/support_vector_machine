I got completely rocked for whatever reason.  What makes no sense whatsoever is that neurobiology was insanely difficult and complex yet I did very well on it.  Hrm, aside from that, school has been good.  In terms of people around here, there is a certain person who I thought more highly of until they were "tested".  Literally, they are here "only for themself", and is hence being cut-off.  Here's the story.  We went to the airport yesterday to try to get tickets for St. Marteen for mid-semester break, but one of our friends wasn't with us.  As we were getting our own tickets, I told them to ask to see how many tickets/seats are left so that we can either a) get tickets for our friend(s) or b) tell our friends that there are only a few tickets left.  The person, instead of saying it was a good idea to ask, rudely replied back to me that "I'm here for myself...if someone else wants tickets, I don't care.."  I replied back, "You're not going to be a successful doctor with that attitude..." and they replied back, "yeah, whatever..."  Also, this person has been pissed off at my roommate for the past week.  And get this, either this person is really not cluing in, or something is messed up.  Last night, they ordered a pizza for themselves, and didn't even offer a slice to anyone!! Unbelievable!  That's three strikes - and time to be cut-off.  Good luck getting through the next little while ;)  Now, aside from that, which must all be taken into context, I can't wait until I get back home.  There are like 60 days left!!  And tomorrow is the UTM Graduation!  JL, congrats!!  I wish you the best!  Bye for now!
