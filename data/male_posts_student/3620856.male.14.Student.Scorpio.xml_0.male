It may seem that I have friends, but, are those friends of mine reliable in times of trouble? The answer is very obvious... It would be no... In this world, the hardest treasure to find is true friends that can be reliable even though you are in some kind of trouble... That was what one of my school teachers used to say... At that time, i did not really understood what it meant, but, now i finally understood what it meant... Most of my friends or maybe all of them make use of me... Like the come to my house to play my PS2 as they do not have... They do not really regard me as a friend, but as a tool for their own amusement... And, I hate these type of people...  So far today was boring as usual, but, my mum signed me up for some japanese lessons at a building near outram park MRT station... It cheered me up alot... I hope that I can take up japanese as an 'O' level subject if I do well in it... Then, I have a higher chance of passing my 'O' levels...   I really wonder if anyone comes to my blog... They web-counter shows 100+ people, but, none of them tagged... How sad....
