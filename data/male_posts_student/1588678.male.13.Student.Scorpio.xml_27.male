From exotic cars like the Lamborghini and Ferrari to the big American names such as Cadillac and Ford, they had it all! Going to this show is real fun. They have the show on the week of Thanksgiving and they not only show off new cars but they let you sit in them, except for cars like the Lamborghini and Maserati. It’s real cool sitting in a brand-new 2004 Porsche Carrera or a 2004 Cadillac CTS. I think that it’s torture for some people, I mean, people with sit in a 2004 Cadillac CTS and get real comfy, but then they realize that can’t afford a car that expensive. It’s always fun. I went last year, had a great time, and I hope to go every year to check out the new models.   I really have a passion for cars. That’s the reason I went, duhhh. I went in all sorts of cars. I’ll tell you some of the coolest cars I went in. I went in the Cadillac Escalade EXT, the Chevrolet Corvette, the Audi TT Roadster, and the Porsche Boxster. They all friggin’ awesome! Sadly, this year they didn’t show the Batmobile like they did last year. Oh well. Okay, so if you’re into cars, you got 7 bucks, and you live in the bay area, then go to the annual car show in San Francisco. You’ll have fun.
