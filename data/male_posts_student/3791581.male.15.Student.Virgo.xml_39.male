Its quite a landmark in this city and an eating experience that you have to do at least once (probably because you won't be able to handle another round after that) when you're in town.  For you trivia buffs, they serve 200 miles of hot dogs, a ton of onions, 2500 pounds of potatoes, 2000 pounds of fresh and never frozen onion rings, 5000 fried pies and 300 gallons of chili made from scratch on a daily basis.   We had the chili dogs with a side of onion rings, a burger with fries, chocolate milkshake, the orange frosty and Coke (you can't say Pepsi in this city). It was sinfully delicious, but still no comparison to  In-N-Out . I had hoped to try their famous fried peach pie, but the thought of another greasy bite was too much for one day.  Yup, you bet I worked out tonight and probably should up that cardio time for the rest of the month. Ugh!
