I was planning for this month to go out with a bang, but I guess that today is going to be as much of a boring monkey-face as the rest of the month.  So I've had this webjournal for 2 months, eh?   OH SHOOT i gotta go... dangit... i'll update later... :-D  LATER:  Okay, I'm back, and i have something to talk about.  What the hell is this? I know a bunch of girls who play soccer and they always have these stupid lists that compare playing soccer with doing the nasty. Here is one i saw just recently(i hope i can remember the whole thing)  1.We work balls really well 2.We have tremendous stamina and endurance 3.We do it for 90 minutes in 11 different positions 4.We like to be on top of our game 5.We enjoy getting hot and sweaty 6.We wear short shorts for easy play 7.We're used to getting our knees dirty 8.We know how to take it up the middle 9.We go hard at headers 10.We play the field until we SCORE!!!  What??!?!? Does being a soccer player automatically make you think it's funny to act like a prostitute? It's just not funny! It may be semi-clever, but it's not funny. It's just stupid.  If you got offended by that, you obviously need to do some meditation and figure out WHY that registers in your head as funny. Because it's not.  How's that for going out with a bang? Yes, yes, i know, i kick ass.
