Do We Know" ?  mrRee: no.  mrJoe: oh..it looks interesting it's i guess a documentary weaved into a story  mrRee: yea...  mrJoe: and i guess it's mainly about quantum physics and theory of knowledge a cereberal movie i hear it's pretty interesting.  mrRee: yea... i just found some stuff on it... washington times reviewer says.."it is suggested that the reality we live in is not even real. Reality is what we make it to be." mrJoe: yeah... i guess it addresses our perceptions... and our biases, and how they affect what we think we know... but i hear it's quite entertaining. like the way they did the movie.  mrRee: says it focuses on "the power of the mind" and makes references to 1993 some experiment of "meditation" experts to try to "will" the crime rate to decrease.  mrJoe: a couple of my friends saw it.  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: so i have a question  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: based on my year or so of working w/ home base... i have noticed..that 99 percent of the people who volunteer at things like this, or shelters...are well... kinda the "freeks and geeks"  mrRee: okay?  mrJoe: like if i were to place them in high school. they would be like the band and drama kids. for the most part...why do you suppose that is? even my buddy Chris told me he was kinda a nerd in high school.  mrRee: well in order to answer that you'd have to look at what the "cool" kids in high school are doing now... pretty much the same things they did in high school.  mrJoe: but what causes the "not so cool" kids to be more altruistic. ? i mean...i recall in high school a lot of them band and drama kids would volunteer for things even back then.  mrRee: okay. so it's not that they changed... it's they they didn't.  mrJoe: i think it's something in the water.  mrRee: i mean... it would seem that their priorities remained the same.  mrJoe: well they weren't born out of the womb like that though..is my point. mrRee: and you know that how?  mrJoe: because i wasn't. perhaps some were. but at the least i can say not all of them were. mrRee: but you weren't a "nerd" in high school either.  mrJoe: right..  mrRee: so you're the one that's different.  mrJoe: i can't imagine i'm the only one that's different. i guess what i'm getting at is..  mrRee: okay then based on your observation that "most" were nerds.. than you're one of the few that are different.  mrJoe: perhaps there is a connection...between people who feel that they don't fit in..and altruism... mrRee: you could attempt to make the connection but i think you'd fail in the effort. look at a lot of the major foundations... they're started by popular, successful people.  mrJoe: successfull and popular ? or successfull. ? think about all the freeks and geeks... from high school  mrRee: yea?  mrJoe: at least from my school... most of them are getting pretty crazy in their careers. u think Bill gates was a pimp? lol  mrRee: yea but bill gates was and still is a nerd.. also considered by most to be a thief... and cheated on his wife.. for the hell of it..  mrJoe: but the man gives a lot to charity.  mrRee: and gets hefty tax write offs for it...  mrJoe: cheating on his wife, and being a thief, doesn't mean he isn't altruistic. he might be morally flawed...  mrRee: and has been convicted of having a monopoly and bullying other smaller companies.  mrJoe: but...those aren't mutually exclusive categories. this isn't a moral issue. the question is what causes people to stray towards altruism. mrRee: but it is... or can be.  mrJoe: is there a connection between that and social misfits? and the key word is connection.  mrRee: i think you have to be careful... with the word "misfits"  mrJoe: like a study/survery in psychology...i wouldn't necessarily fail as you say. because i'm not looking for proof. i'm looking for a trend. a connection. not cause and effect.  mrRee: you would have to make the connection that a majority of "self-less" people are "social misfits"  mrJoe: i doubt i'd have a problem..with that. especially after revising your statement a bit. not "self-less" but active volunteers for charitable organizations. remember that was my original observation.  mrRee: well you didn't say that .. you specifically used the word altruist. or altruism.. which basically means unselfish. there are many a people who volunteer for selfish reasons.  mrJoe: i guess i was using the word alturistic looslely  mrRee: like you were telling me before... people who volunteer because it makes them feel better... well that's not being so much self-less as being selfish. if they didn't feel "better" they wouldn't do it. forget about the people they're helping.  mrJoe: popularly, people use the word altruism, as "do gooders" not necessarily moral people.  mrRee: and then there are the few who do it regardless of self gain.. regardless of how much it sucks.. because in the end they know someone... regardless is benefitting.  mrJoe: not necessarily self less...  mrRee: and there are many "doo gooders" who don't volunteer for lack of time...  mrJoe: dude... mrRee: but they may contribute $50,000 which plays just as significant a role.  mrJoe: you're being ridiculous now. stop. mrRee: and how's that?  mrJoe: well you're arguing for the sake of arguing.  mrRee: no...  mrJoe: that's a whole other tangent lack of time? giving money that's not what i was talking about. at all. that's another chapter.  mrRee: well i'm just saying there are a lot of things you need to consider.. such as... a lot of the "popular" kids in school may be pro athletes or doctors or lawyers or huge business men who can't afford the time to go and volunteer 4 or 5 hours a week.... but they may give to charities... and to say that the people who are physically volunteering are doing any more than the people funding might be incorrect.  mrJoe: ah.... but i didn't say that. that's what i mean...you're bringing conclusions in...and arguing them as if i said them.. but that's the thing. you said it.  mrRee: but you made the observation that the "nerds" are the ones volunteering.. and you were wondering if there is a "connection" between "social mis-fits" and altruism. and i'm saying that you can't go strictly on your observation because you're not taking some large factors into consideration. and that's the time factor.  mrJoe: again, my "study/survey" is not who is doing more good. who is more "self-less" or moral.  mrRee: and i'm not saying that...  mrJoe:? you wrote: and to say that the people who are physically volunteering are doing any more than the people funding might be incorrect.  mrRee: i'm just saying that unless you consider all these other factors you couldn't come to a complete conclusion.  mrJoe: again my friend, you are jumping the gun. complete conclusion?  mrRee: yea.  mrJoe: i never said i wanted one. psychology is never conclusive. i could draw trends cite phenomena's...  mrRee: if you did a survey of people who volunteer.. and you said you were pretty sure, you'd find that the "nerds" were the ones volunteering for the most part .  mrJoe: but it's not a complete conclusion. yeah... then i could say..hey..there tends to be a trend. and then perhaps you could look at why? but i ain't goin that far chief. i don't need a cause and effect answer. i can't think of a single cause and effect answer in all of social pyschology.  mrRee: but remember you were wondering about the "connection" between nerds and volunteers, more specifically "what causes the "not so cool" kids to be more altruistic."  mrJoe: ok...even so, again it would be all things considered...but my point is..you need not bring in the thought that I am seeking who is on higher moral ground. and i'm simply saying you can't answer that question without first proving that  they are...  mrRee: and my point was not to equate a higher moral ground... although i'm sure you and i would both consider it "better" to be self-less than selfish  mrJoe: we know there is not direct correlation between active volunteerism and morality (especially since morality is seen as highly subjective/cultural/conditioned responses.) i think the act of it is a good act. but those very people are morally corrupt too. *may be morally corrupt.  mrRee: true and ... well i'd better not get myself started  so bz day?   mrJoe: pretty darn slow. whens class?  mrRee: 6pm so... i'm doing a lot better with the whole relationship thing.  mrJoe: are you? what's new?  mrRee: just over the past few weeks been working on getting to know God more... build a relationship... and last night i was driving home from the gym.. and really, for probably one of the first times in my life... felt a trust... i should more correctly say.. a rumble in my faith... just an assurance and a peace that comes from being able to just trust him... you know? and of course i'm not negating the possibility of loneliness or what not...  mrJoe: hmmm... you know sunday night.  mrRee:?  mrJoe: i guess it was actually the afternoon i was headed to the mall. and i just started singing. praising. and it was overwhelming. and for that moment i knew true bliss. i think i'm doing better too..w/ the relationship thing.  mrRee: yea. well like today i was just walking through the mall buying some stuff... and normally i'd start looking around and be like {sigh} one for me please? but as i looked and admired God's handy work... i noticed that's all it was, an admiration... and then i had that same peace... that it's all in his hands.  mrJoe: lol yeah... i was driving today... to work and thinking...of how i want to be w/ someone. and i still desire her. but...  mrRee: butt...  mrJoe: i dunno...i'm living, breathing, moving along. i'm not even sure i need anyone. i mean i do in one sense. and in another i don't. you know?  mrRee: yea... i about gotta go... but think about about this one. did God's master plan really have woman in it? i mean of course...but look at it this way. God, knowing that Jesus would have to die for us... created us none the less... but i'm sure he'd have preferred some other way... either way.. so he creates adam and places him in the garden. (here's the 1st ?, why didn't he create eve at the same time?) and next. why did he wait until adam felt a longing until he created eve? i mean if it was his intention to create both why not together or why wait...  mrJoe: hold on a sec.  mrRee: i was thinking...maybe it's a fundamental flaw in man. God would have rather us not needed "woman" and just commune with him... but being created human and imperfect... it's a flaw in us?  mrJoe: yeah...i've been thinking about that stuff too.. like was it a flaw in adam? but i think the word would articulate that, you would think?  mrRee: i don't know.  mrJoe: but it was God who says "it's not good for man to be alone" but we know people who have been celibate and content. so it's clearly possible for man to find completeness in God.  mrRee: but if you really read.. look God says it's not good for man to be alone...  mrJoe: in fact...everyone we know is going to face this one time or another in their life.  mrRee: so what happens next.? he creates animals. and adam names them and still didn't find a "helper" comparable to him...  mrJoe: hmmm..  mrRee: so then God created eve.  mrJoe: God the problem solver...  mrRee: interesting how i never noticed that flow of events until just now  ?  mrJoe: why in his omniscience... does he seem to operate like reasoning man. or is this going back to God being outside of time.  mrRee: who knows my friend... not i... not i... i'm gonna get ready for school. mrJoe: alright  mrRee: i'll talk to you l8er...  mrJoe: yup.  mrRee: thanks for the chat. peece.  mrJoe: ;o)
