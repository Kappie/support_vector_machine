Sometimes I have nothing to read except magazines, but now I have far too many books lying around than there is time to read. I'm ploughing through the fifth  Harry Potter  book - a mammoth piece - for the second time, with my latest EDGE magazine fighting for my attention as well. Waiting in the wings are the  Virgin Alternate Guide to Universities ,  The Ultimate History of Videogames  and  Driving: The Essential Skills . With only up to an hour a day set aside to read this lot, it's going to take aaaaggggeeessss!
