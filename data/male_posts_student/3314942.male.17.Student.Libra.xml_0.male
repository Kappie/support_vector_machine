The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. -Pablo Picasso   when one considers themself an artist, what does it really mean? i caight myself when i started saying that i was an artist to everyone. what does this entail? do i, as an artist, get special privileges of thought or inspiration? What defines me as an artist and not a regular worker? these are my thoughts as of late.   here is my answer, with a little help from my friends.... Georgia O'Keefe one said that "Everyone has mahny associations with a flower. You put out yor hand to touch it, or lean forward to smell it, or maybe touch it with your lips almost without thinking, or give it to someone to please them. But one rarely takes the time to reall see a flower. I have painted what each flower is to me and i have painted it big enough so that others will see what i see."  If one takes the interpretation of the flower to mean a person's views, thoughts, and emotions, this defines what an a artist does. They use those visual, auditory, sensual, olfactory, and all other senses to help others see what they see. When i was a young child, (7,8,9) i would always question what i saw. Am i seeing what everybody else sees, or am i interpreting it differently. If i looked at the color of a flower, i would think about whether everybody else saw that same color. I believed, in some way, that i saw everything different from everybody else. This, it seems, fueled my desire to be an artist. I wanted to relate my own thoughts, emotions, visions, and perceptions to others through my art. Art, as cliche as it sounds, is the window into my thoughts, emotions, and on the deepest level, my soul. I want to stay a child, as picasso said, we are all artists when were children. We all thought differently, without any preconceived notions or fore thought. We had no control over it, and that was the beauty.
