Well i tell you something, i have become one person whose heart has no love or compassion or anything. I have no dam feelings for anything or anyone, call me heartless if you want to but that is what i am!!!! Coburn yesterday told me that i could get the gal of my dreams if i tried, huh that i will never believe, because i know that i do not have the looks to have a gal notice me!!!! in fact i don't think any gal will ever notice me!!! because i know i don't possess the good looks to get a gal to notice me. ok back to the top, well some people may ask why i have no love or compassion in my heart, well i can tell you why. Because nobody has shown me love, care ,compassion or even concern. instead before i lost my humanity in my heart, i had a lot of it in my heart, but everybody just treated me like trash, no one respects me and the things i do, i am just a person to be used or pushed around, some of them even back stabbed me even though i help them, to everyone in my school or in NCC i am just one extra, nothing more and nothing less. That is when i had it, i told myself why should i show love and compassion to anything or anyone huh!!! nobody respects me at all so why should i even give a hint in even showing a bit of compassion to any of them!!! that is why from then on i have become a heartless person,my hearthas no feelings , no remorse or sadness or even pity, just emptiness nothing more and nothing less. Some may say i am a sick violent sadistic bastard, but i don't really care, so long as any person who dares cross my path, he will pay dearly and wish he never did!!!! While i will just stand there and savour every moment he suffers hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!! ok so this year i won't be expecting any Happy birthday wishes to me or even presents this year, i will just ask me parents to put me up in some fancy restuarant with a large buffet and just enjoy myself!!!!!!!! and to think my birthday is only 21 days from now!!!!!!!!!
