While I waited for them, who should walk up to me but Angela DiMillo! Holy George Washington Christ, I haven't seen her in 2 years! We talked, uch to the annoyance of my brothers, for a good solid hour, and she told me that we have to hang out this week, she's supposed to call me this afternoon. HOORAY FOR SINGING PARTNER REUNIONS!      ...That is all...
