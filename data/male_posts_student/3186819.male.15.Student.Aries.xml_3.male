Some bitch (aka my mom) used my computer super early and somehow DISABLED my alarm, because she stole my alarm clock. Why? Because sho so BRILLIANTLY spilled water on hers. So anyways. I go to have a shower, and my sister Queen Bitchala, Queen of Slutty Whores bolts into the bathroom as soon as I say I'm having a shower. And then, what does my mom do? SHE YELLS AT ME FOR GETTING ANGRY AT HER! "You've been yelling the past couple of days" she says. So I replied "Maybe thats because you won't get off my f***ing  back, because heaven forbid Brit gets a little less. because she is such a bitch she gets everything" and then she yells again to stop yelling, when I was only speaking loud enough to go over the noise of the seemingly extra loud, very water hoggish shower. So now I can't bloody have my coffee, because mom and her boyfriend USED THE MILK I PUT A NOTE ON SAYING PLEASE DO NOT DRINK. She treat him so much better then she treats me. She'll offer if we're out to buy him a coffee, but will deny me a coffee. Last night I asked to go along on the ride with them, even though it wasn't anything big. She flat out says No, because she had a hard day and wants to go alone. AND THEN SHE TURNS AROUND AND ASKS JEFF (her deaf b/f) TO GO, EVEN THOUGH I AM DIRECTLY AROUND HER. Damn I am pissed off.
