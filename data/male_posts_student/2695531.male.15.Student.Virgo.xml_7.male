He's been calledeverything from a brilliant producer to liberal lying trash and just about everything in between. He's been called the liberal Rush Limbaugh and a political voice of Hollywood. He's Michael Moore, creator of the hot new controversial film, Fahrenheit 9/11. The documentary indicts George W. Bush and his administration on our intelligence failures that lead to 9/11 and introduces far-fetched allegations that alarm some and are dismissed as lies by others. The film's controversy sparks in the middle of a hot summer before a hot election. Experts say that this movie may open the door to more politically-motivated movies and documentaries. I haven't seen the movie yet but hope too soon. I can only assume that the Bush family has not yet seen it either.
