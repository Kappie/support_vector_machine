DS pros-Two screens, touch screen, GCN connectivity.    cons- too big if you ask me ... also no Mp3s...  PSP pros- Great graphics (as with the DS) Mp3s, and i hink theres a rumor of DVD capabilities AND a Metal Gear Solid Game for PSP!!!!      cons- Well not much other than Sony's ability to screw you over when you by it as soon as it comes out.   Well thats about it i guess ill see you later.
