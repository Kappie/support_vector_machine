Riding on a tractor. Getting sun-burned. Initiating a Rolf Harris Tribute band. Under-performing in the National IQ test. Handcrafting a new cricket bat. Excelling in the First Annual Sudbrooke ball game championship!  All of which resulted in the lack of posts over the weekend. But rest assured that as dawn breaks tomorrow I shall be updating you all on the crazy goings-on that occurred, including photos courtesy of Miss Raynor!  Apologies also to Miss Kendrick, I shall endeavour to get your link posted tomorrow too!
