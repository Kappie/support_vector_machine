I know, I've lost a certain amount of modesty, but seriously... if you don't count a few prop problems it went ├über-well... as far as I know I didn't quite succeed in making LFZN cry but I know I think I know I came close. Yay, I think. But still, *sighs* tonight was cool. I also got to walk back to Charlton Kings from town with 3 absolutely stunning girls, Lawa being one. I mean, seriously... über-happy.  The past 2 days have been... well, artistically speaking, the best of my life. I've been part of the first of what will be 3 stunning performances of the best musical ever, I've found out that I'm in at least the top 100 youth trombonists in Britain... I'm... pretty happy, let's put it that way. There are only a couple of ways this could be made even better.  Oh, and I'm in love with Scott, and I'm going to marry him when I'm older. Really. Nah, but still, he's cool.  Quote of the day: " Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God, Eponine. The things you do.   I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you.   Get out before the trouble starts, Get out, 'Ponine! You might get shot...   I've got you worried now, I have, That shows you like me quite a lot. "  From   The Barricade   from   Les Misérables -  A Musical written by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, translated by Herbert Kretzmer   Love, Jon Roskilly
