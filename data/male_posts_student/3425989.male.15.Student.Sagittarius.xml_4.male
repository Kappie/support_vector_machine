I have chosen this new name becuase I have decided to open my religion to the world, infidel means in laymen terms a non-believer in god. At least that will be what I use it for. If thats not good enough, guess what, www.dictionary.com Anyway, I live in San Antonio, and my name shall remain ind1d31 (1337 5k1ll5!) for my privacy's sake. And that's all for now, I believe this is ample info to get started.
