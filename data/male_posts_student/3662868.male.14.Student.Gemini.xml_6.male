The poison ivy is healing now, and has stopped itching. As for the bug bites, cortizone works great. Lately I've been: Looking for a summer job, trying to make money off of advertising on my website, sleeping a lot, playing video games, and hanging out with girls. This gives me almost nothing to rant about. Almost. I could bitch and bitch about not having enough money, but no one cares about the money. The entire U.S. lifestyle is all about the money. Unless you were born with a golden spoon up your ass, you know about the money problems that almost all of us face. Now that I really think about it, I don't  need  money, I just want it so I can have the things I want. So I guess for now life is good. Kinda. I think I'm going to be away for the 4th of July. I'm pretty sure we're going to Williamsburg, VA like we always do. My grandparents and relatives live there, so we always rush down there every chance we get. My friends always hate to see me go because: A:I'm not on xbox live, and B:All the girls miss me because they can't stand it when I'm gone for more than 5 minutes. Oh boo hoo. I've got stuff to type up now, but I think I'm gonna go ride my bike instead. I dunno... Ok, peace out my homies and serial killers. :)
