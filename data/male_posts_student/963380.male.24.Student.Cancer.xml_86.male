The second being last night and the third, of course, being the ever swank semi-annual inventory. The upside to closing last night was that Scotty in software made me aware of the arrival of the Legend of Zelda pre-order disc. For those of you joining us from home, you may or may not be aware of my utter affection for videogames. Zelda games in particular. The only official Zelda games that I do not own, have in my possession nor have I ever played are the two Zelda games for Nintendo 64 - The Ocarina of Time (OoT) and Majora's Mask.   The great gods at Nintendo have seen fit (through the devination of their sales numbers, ranked third currently in a three man race against Sony and Microsoft) to include this bonus disc. Basically what transpires is as follows - you walk into an Electronics Store(tm) and say to your drone/rep/register biscuit "I'd like to place a 20$ preorder on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for the Nintendo GameCube". The Biscuit will print you out a slip for The Legend of Zelda: Gayest Title Evar and promptly hand you a Gamecube disc. For a brief moment you'll shit your pants, as you believe s/he has just handed you the game itself, then you heart will shatter as you believe it's just a movie disc.   This is where we cut to the chase - it's actually a game disc. Not a demo. A full fucking game. And that game is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It's like searching for the holy grail all your life and then to win it in a raffle at the age of 83. Hot damn. I picked it up last night. Didn't really worry about it too much. I seemed able to contain my excitement. I logged  off, went to bed and tried to sleep. As the minutes ticked by, so too did the visions of rupees, hookshots and the little blond bastard in green(and you wonder why I associate with this character to much).  So there I was. Playing Zelda, in the middle of the night. Holy god, it's such a cool game. I mean this thing is totally circa 1999, but I'm right into it. The only better thing than this, Zelda wise, is the demo of the new on the cube at work.  In other news - life is progressing nicely. Going to look at some houses this week.  I've got to do some more work on the website for Voyager and for 8 Wheels. Maybe I might even do a little work on my own site. Who knows. I'm debating on whether or not to buy C Generals. It looks sooo tasty. You've got the Chinese, who everyone's going to love to hate, the Americans, who everyone is going to love to be and the dirty fucking terrorists who everyone is going to love to use as cannon fodder. I'm thinking of setting up an account on westwood online dedicated to the spectacular losses of the DFT's.  Finally - got my wing mirror fixed, that was happy. And free. My cornea is doing nicely. My monitor, not my eyes. My eyes are still fucked up, as per usual.  That's pretty much all for now. If there's one upside to this inventory, it's that Brady isn't here. Dude is *still* wearing the same fucking sweater.
