Today, I went over to Britt's and basically we did nothing but hang out. We went and had lunch at Eppy's and then came back and just hung for a while. Tomorrow night we're going to the Braves game and maybe out to eat, idk, so that should be fun. Me and Ashley sat out on the patio for a while and she told me a bunch of stuff that I'm definitely not posting here, but it was cool. She has made some stupid decisions in her life, and she realizes that, but she is very mature to be 16. My grandmother's surgeon told my mom today that he thinks she has a year to live. Her cancer is the fastest spreading kind. Oh well, what can you do but enjoy the last year with her? It's one year she didn't have if she wouldn't have had the surgery. I got my online class grade. 77 in the class and a 79 on the final. I damn near passed out when I saw that I'd made a 79 on the final, considering I didn't study for it AT ALL. Oh well, I can't think of anything else. Tomorrow should bring some interesting pictures from the Braves game, hahaha. Later.
