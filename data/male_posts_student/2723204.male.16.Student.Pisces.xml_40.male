Cos' the crowd was bigger and it was like everyone was in a much better mood.........Thursday can actually be said to be a very memorable day to me, cos' I've bared my heart out to 3 people spontaneously, in the first time of my life. XY, Stella and WH. The details shall be witheld here. And these few weeks have been more or less emotional weeks. But nonetheless, its still pretty happy weeks. I can't really say much in this blog, even though i've got tons of things to say really.   My intellectual tank has been running low, but my emotional tank is running high. I've been getting into J-pop lately, Ayumi and DAI, respectively, someone recommended me a list of J-rock bands and i should really check them out someday except for the Kazaa which somehow lags up my whole comp. So, gotta depend on WH for Jap stuff now. And I've just learnt the intro for Tao Ze's Pu tong peng you, not easy man, cos' i suck at fingerstyle. But, can tell that there's a certain technical level involved and the chords are pretty complex, almost jazz i tell you, that guy's talented, even though he suck at the guitar lol. I've just gotten new strings for electric. changed everthing, GHS, super steels, its meant to be the brightest of all GHS', in tone of course. My guitar's now playing very well, and i've had the ball ends on the headstock, so i wun have to spend the hassle rremoving them, saw one guy in UG doing that, SV 300, lol....  But as for school-wise, i've realized one thing after not going to school this tuesday, I am really, very optimistic about going to school really, i think this year is one of the best years yet, in my school life that is. I thought Sec 2 was great, but now, I think its better. In fact, if you ask me, I prefer my weekdays then my weekends. This tuesday totally sucked, i was damn bored at home, spent most of the time sleeping, talked to WH on MSN at night, cos' I NEED CONVERSATION !!!, esp. with those people in school, XY couldn't come online, they 2 are now competing in the league table of my history of MSN conversations, both of them all stand at 3+ MB. I don't think I'll write anything intellectual today, (Rina?, ur comp is spoilt yea i noe, but i'll try to write something, when i've got inspiration that is......).  I've also been listening to some satch lately, and I can say i've really been inspired to play guitar all over again. Improving my technique and learning new stuff, but right now, not much time, so I can't really do that. Alot of things are brewing in my class, lots of stuff, but I won't say here. I'm starting to like physics more, really, and at the same time, hating chem more. Just got loads of DT this week, but i can say all went pretty well, maybe except for Emaths. Which most probably my marks would hover around the B-C range, as for the rest, i can say it went pretty well. Seriously, i actually don't have monday blues anymore, and its like, I don't dread mondays. Yea............my life right now is at its up point, up......  Intellectually, I've not been challenged lately, and neither have I read any new stuff............so nope, like I said, no intellectual posts........and Rina, if you're reading this, its like, we need to talk man, I need a mentor, WH told me you wrote the INTRODUCTION where liberty (social liberty if i'm not wrong?) is concerned, and this introduction, happened to be as thick as his file (or so he said.) And really, i need a mentor man, u can be one.........seriously............  :) that's all for today
