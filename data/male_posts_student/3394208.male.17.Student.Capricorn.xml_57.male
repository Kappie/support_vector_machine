Can I hear us?  Falling back to the ground Never even made a sound Won't you ever leave this town?  4 weeks have gone by Wanted to scream, but he did not try Killing his fears, he challenged he and said  You have no idea what it's like What it's like to be me...  Unhinging all these screws She says she wants something different No options left to choose He says he wants something different Paying all these dues I wish that something was different Yeah something was different No matter what happens to you today
