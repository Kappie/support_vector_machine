Meagan, Sammy, Justin, Katherine, Noel, Colin, Ann Marie,   Week 1-2: Write a paragraph on what you see as communicating on the Internet.  	Communicating on the internet can take many forms. The one people are most familiar with is E-mail. Most everybody has an e-mail addres nowadays and people use them often. Also, people use chat rooms or instant messangers to commuicate in real time over the internet. This has been beneficial not only to the public sector but the private as well. People also communicte over the interenet by message boards and weblogs. These can provide anything from feedback on a website to discussion and debate. I feel that these three or four instances cover the msjority of communication on the internet.
