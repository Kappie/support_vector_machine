Remember the verse in the bible where Jesus talks about when someone strikes you on one cheek, you should turn to let him strike the other? I have a lot of experience with this subject (literally and figuratively... ouch). This passage doesn't neccessarily mean that you should go around letting people slap you. I do have a friend who does that to me on occasion physically, though. What it does mean is we should not seek revenge. We should give people what they ask of us (unless, in my opinion, it is harmful to them). As Christians, whe will constantly be expected to be different by both other Christians and non-Christians alike. Not flying off the handle every time someone is mean to us is one way we can portray that God can make a change in your life.      I've been persecuted a lot in my life, whether or not it was for being a Christian. I've found that whenever I get mad and get even, the problem gets worse, and more people become involved in the squabble. But when I "turn the other cheek," someone always seems to notice, and wants to know what I have that can let me take teasing, tormenting, and physical violence.       When we do what God tells us is right, and we do it for the right reasons, it will make amazing changes in our lives and in the lives of people around us. Try it some time and you'll see what I mean.       Godspeed,
