It's strange because I totaly SUCKED when I tryed out but I guess she knows I can do better :) Well I hung out with Nape at the REC today and shot some baskets till my mom came and got us. I got home and played a very little amount of counter-strike then I had dinner, shot my paint ball gun (Real fun I was running and shooting at trees :) ), cut the grass (I love to cut the grass :) ) and now im going to play counter-strike for an hour and go to bed.
