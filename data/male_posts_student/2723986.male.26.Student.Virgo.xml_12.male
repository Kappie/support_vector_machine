I really felt the Panthers were going to get the upset, but when they gave up that last 20-yard pass it killed them.  Adam Vientieri (sp?) really didn’t deserve to kick yet  another  game winner, especially after blowing an easy 31-yard try earlier in the game.  And what’s up with the referees giving New England the first down on that fourth down attempt in the second quarter?  It was obvious in the replays that Smith never got back to the line of scrimmage, but even after a long review the refs said he made it?  Replay was included in the NFL so these things would be called  correctly  fellas, sheesh…  Anyway, it was a terrific game that had plenty of everything for football fans: hard-nosed defense, long pass plays, explosive runs, etc.  I just hope it’ll be remembered for more than the fact that Janet Jackson showed her boob during the halftime show.
