I still can't believe i hitted a "shina", shina is when the guy in the net lifts the ball, and he's not looking at you, so you have to jump to the corner of the net and hit in the diagonal. Wow, it was my first time hitting a shina. I slept all long afternoon. And now i'm hungry.   I watched that movie "the day after tomorrow", wow, it is soooo "nice", was very bad watching LA being distroyed. The wolves part was the most scary.   Phrases of the week: "Don't consider me the boss, consider me just as a co-worker who's always right" (good one)  "Fat woman is like Ferrari... when goes upon the scale goes from zero to 100 in one second"
