So i have had it with me having to be all happy for people! Just cos they got tired of me being the way i am! You may think what the hell is this mad person going on about Let me explain. After i started this blog things happened and if you have the read the 1st one the address is here.   urlLink   .Well It seems like "people as sam put it had had enough of me like a little comment he made: Sam was saying that no one cared about him (which is shit!) and i was like no one cares about me here and he said "Alim people stopped caring for you ages ago." Now soon after this happened me and sam had a fight and well he called me and said people he had talked to had had enough of me being like the way i was (which was not letting anyone help me and sad all the time ) but i only did it cos i knew that they didnt care! so why should i tell some person who doesnt really care about what i do feel that i am depressed and cutting my self. So for the last week or so i have been putting up my act again for other people. And i am going to continue doing so cos people dont care. I know some do but the people that i see regularly dont give a shite about the way i feel. And i do with them although i may not show it i can tell when someone is upset or something because i am good at reading body languge. But back to what i was wasting time about. Perhaps i do need to see someone or tell My most lovely form tutor (who i love to bits) about me cutting my self. She might be able to help me get through this but some how i doubt it i am just so weak and i have no inner strength left to fight this endless battle. And i know i should be happy about glasto which was soo good but i just cant be not on the inside. The novalty has worn off with it. I just dont know how to feel happyness properly i mean even during glastonbury i felt crap which is better than i did before but there were things like my brother and Jess just going off together all the time and leaving me on my own and my brother and jess taking the piss out of me all the time. And so i have given up once again it seems i  have been beaten again. Or perhaps i never beat it and it was playing dead. Well we shall see won't we.
