I really don't buy into this, I mean who the hell else are conservatives going to vote for in November?    But it's funny to see  urlLink Drudge  give headline coverage to Kerry's wife because she told a reporter to  SHOVE IT .  Not quite the same though, is it?  Cheny told a Senator to  GO FUCK YOURSELF , which seems to me, oh I don't know, something that overtly crazy and  urlLink angry  Howard Dean might have done.  He was one crazy man.
