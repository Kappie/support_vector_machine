I just got back from Berkely and it was pretty interesting, but mostly just crowed. The track camp was kind of fun, but I pulled my groin so I couldn't do anything most of the time. At least I have some cool stories for when I get back like how some of the other resident campers tried to stuff me down the linen shoot from eight stories up.
