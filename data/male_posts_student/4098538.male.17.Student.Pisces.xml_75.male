Well I think I must of fell asleep because the next thing I knew, it was 2.00am and the water was really cold. I got out and I felt so weird. I couldn't think straight at all. I felt too weird to dry myself, so I got into bed soaking. Then I woke up at about 5am and it was really bright outside. I couldn't hear a thing either. Since then, I woke up every 20 minutes in some kind of panic. It's really strange, I don't know what's happening to me. I have a really sore throat but I don't think that has anything to do with it. I also keep getting hot and cold flushes. When I move around, it feels like my brain is rattling around in my head. It's quite painful.
