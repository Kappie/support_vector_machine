The ones that I specifically crossed off on my schedule confirmation.  What classes am I not signed up for?  Only the ones that I need to get in order to attend college.  I don't want to deal with these stupid scheduling problems and I really have a sincere desire to yell FUCK as loud as I can, but since I can't because I will be in trouble I will yell it into cyberspace.          FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
