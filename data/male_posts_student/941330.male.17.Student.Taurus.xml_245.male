(cue awkward transition!) i don't know about you, but i fight (verbally, duh, my dad would clip my third left toenail if i threw punches) a lot with my brother. why? it's all ass-backwards and counterproductive. we talk at dinnertime and he'll think he's being clever by saying something to the tone of "what did you expect from ryan?" then of course i have to say something back because i can't give him the quasi-orgasmic pleasure of having the last word, no matter how much it resembles the speech patterns of a retarded boil-infested hemorrhoidal monkey. but why do i have to respond to him? it just makes both sides angrier if we continue arguing (and if you can tell, it's not one of those nigh nonexistent "intelligent" or even "not completely incomprehensible" debates), and on top of that, my outlandish motive -- to convince him of the error of his anal-retentive "speak louder and longer" methodology -- will NEVER work, because brothers are members of an alien species that cannot exhibit weakness by acknowledging when someone else is right, correct, or allowed to breathe.  now, on to international week. wasn't it just a wonderful spectacle as american high school fully embraced the interaction of a veritable disorganized potpourri of cultures and ethnicities, highlighting the accomplishments and intriguing fashion eccentricities of people from foreign lands, enlightening the student body on the progress the world has made in terms of international brotherhood, and turning our frowns upside down? aww shit, i overdosed on my prescribed hallucinogens again didn't i. let's see what really happened...my wonderful club, the junior statesman of america, had its country chosen for itself by one officer (namely keshav). to make matters worse, he gave us CANADA. WHAT. besides its french roots and those perpetually wedgied mounties, they have relatively NO cultural flavor whatsoever. oooh, we have waffles and pancakes, hockey and beer, which is wonderful because nobody in the united states has ever had those before!  let's go over how the week really went. monday, we had the obligatory informational posters which nobody ever reads thank you very much. tuesday...my club sold 12 day old STORE-BOUGHT waffles. why in the blue stinking craphole did we choose canada again? that's why we have what they call on the street "cultural" clubs, where they actually show pride in their ethnicity. that's also why we have what they call on the street "countries other than canada." wednesday was a small primer for today's food selling and yesterday's fashion show, i suppose. there were a few cultural dances...jca busted out with their ddr dance, which was a good effort but honestly needed to have more flair and limbs flying around concussing random people. i refuse to mention the word astronomy ever again. yesterday was the fashion show; there were some pretty cool clothes, and i refuse to mention the word astronomy ever again. today, they sold food...in other words, people brought store-bought imitations of foreign foods, cut them into infinitesimally small portions and sold them at double the price. csf and italy was easily the most popular with pizza and lasagna, but it would have been more worthwhile if they brought something more exotic like risotto, polenta, whatever. (no i'm not smart, i found those names from  urlLink here .)  [[happy belated birthday jen chien]]
