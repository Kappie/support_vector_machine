Yesterday was a good friend of mine's last card night.  Alas, she (Rose) and her husband (Josh) are moving to L.A. in about a week.  There were very few of us there last night (in fact, just me, one (out of two) of my roommates and our friend.  So we decide to make it a tequila night.  Now I realize that this may be a side of me most people don't know about... but I actually like the taste of tequila.  It's definitely my liquor of choice (on the occassion that I drink). So we have a couple of shots of some crappy tequila to finish that bottle off, and then decide to walk to the liquor store right down the road from my apartment to get (duh duh duuuuh) the good stuff, Jose Cuervo.    A few more shots later and her husband was finally able to come over, and we watched this REALLY weird Anime movie called Wicked City.  Now, I like anime, I'm not hardcore into it or anything, but I've seen my fair share.  Vampire Hunter D, Akira, and most of the series that's been played on Cartoon Network's [adult swim].  I don't know if it was just that I was tipsy or what, but that movie was one of the wierdest movies i've ever watched... it was also difficult to follow since I probably zonked out once or twice.  I'm going to miss them.  Rose is a good tequila drinkin' buddy.
