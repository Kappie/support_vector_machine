Anyway, it was already the past. Let it be...  This year lots of change in my life, was chosen as the Head Prefect, join St. Nicholas Prefectorial board for the Student Leader Convention. Life is tiring, there are so many instance that i want to give up. Guess it is the passion that keep me up. Met so many wonderful people this year, Candice, Cheryl, Debra, Lirong. These four girls are from the ExCo of St. Nicholas Prefectorial Board. Finally i have a group of good friends who are girls, which i never had in my life till now. Of course not to forget about my fantastic 3 brothers in Prefectorial Board, Daniel, Justin and Yangbin, they accompanied me been through so much, at least i have the three of them to share whenever i am in doubt. Thank you God for giving me all these wonderful friends.  Hasn't been in love for quite a while. Somehow i just have this strong feeling to fall in love. Truthfully speaking, the feeling is strong, to many people, even my friends, i maybe someone who they think fall in love with girls very easy. To them, maybe i am portrayed as a Playboy. However, I know exactly, clearly what i am doing. I just want to have a girl whom i can give my whole care to her and accepted by her. That's simple isn't it?  Turning 18 this September, 18 years old, means independent to me, means lot of decision making has come upon me. Should it be a turning point of myself or will there be a major change in myself? i don't know, i guess nobody knows.   Sometimes, though i have friends, i do still feel i have nobody to talk to and relate to, even with the presence of my mother and m best friends, i do still feel strongly, loneliness. I don't know why. Anyone can tell me?  Hoping for everyday, but it is so difficult to find something to look forward everyday.  Un-Luck, Un-Love, Un-Warm. The Un-Breakable is Breaking.
