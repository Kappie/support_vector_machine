I skated at Menasha and landed a double kickflip on the pyramid, but then i fell and landed on my flat ass. then i tried landed a tripple kickflip on the pyramid and barely landed it but i fell once again. there was this guy that was super good, he backside boardslided an entire pyramid and 50-50 grinded an entire copeing into a transfer on a quarter pipe! then i came home and Alex called and asked me to be her partner for her cousins wedding in October... i agreed so i guess im goin to the wedding thingy with her *so awesome*. Then i went to work and there was this mass flood in the kitchen, the back sink, AND near the water dump drain thingy..... dude that was kool. then i came home and quickly took a shower and when i came down, hilary was there talkin with my sister and bro. lol, hector aka victor said that hilary was hott! lol i was like ohhh yeah. well i went with her to see a movie *black sheep* with a couple of other friends. dude hilary, i've seen that movie!.... i just didnt recognize the title. Yo hilary... maybe it is wise to stay on your side of the lane lol! then we were in my drive way and we were there for a   FEW   minutes lol, and then asked her to go out with me... she responded "Yes". i was so happy i didnt wanna git out... but i had to lol. But now shes goin up north with her friend and wont be back till next week friday saturday or sunday... hmmm, bummer.
