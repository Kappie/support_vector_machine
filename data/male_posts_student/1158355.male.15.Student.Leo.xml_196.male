LmAO rOfl, Iz wuz LiKE JoRDan, KisS mY rUmpdIDDy!@#$#%$ bFFL AFF. uuurrrrrhhhhh...WHY DON'T YOU FUCKING JUST SPEAK JAPANESE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. It's hilarious check these links out, the true faggots of the worlds, only to collect what everyone minorly does and calls it cool and compacts into a gigantic epitome of dick.  urlLink This girl  has got to belong to the dumbest species in this Universe.  urlLink This girl  is from the south and enjoys fucking her brother and also cannot talk right.  urlLink This girl  fucked her boyfriend the first time they went out.  urlLink This girl  talks like a retard but when it comes to the word hole, she adds the w proving that she doesn't know how to spell, and goes to boot camp. Ah, it's so funny. How dumb humans can be. Or are they...aliems. Anyways. Thursday night I had a band practice with Matt and Heaton, that's all I can remember. Friday all I remember is I went to Matt's and then to Pat's. I got to meet Nathan, Tom's girlfriend, one awesome girl and Matt's cousin Alex who I already met. They're both girls. Hahaha uhh... We watched School of Rock at Pat's. Big Party. Party ended when parents came home. Joe Tringali slept over. Dan came over but left shortly. Joe left. I went to Dan's, Gavin, Kristin and Pat were there also. I came home for dinner, then I don't recall doing anything at night, ah yes, babysitting my sister so I couldn't go out. Then yesterday there was no band practice. My dad took me driving in some parking lot. It's harder than I thought but lots of fun. Then later on I went to the mall with Matt, Matt's girlfriend Danielle and Amanda. It was the worst thing ever. We just walked around, never doing it again. It was funny because Matt and Danielle starting making out in the mall. How lame. Very funny though. Uh what else. So that's basically it. Nothing special today. Just boring school. Yep. Ok I've been putting in too many periods so I'm gonna go, bye. Screw this Homestar quote at the end of every blog, that's for nanny's. And I'm only in the blues. Woopdy Dee! Have a bowl of me!
