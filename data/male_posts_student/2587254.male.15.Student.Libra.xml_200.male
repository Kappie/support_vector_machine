All in all, a good day today, starting off with a morning of relaxing, then an afternoon of volunteering, then some catching up with my old fellowship counselor Jesse Wong, yeah today was a good day I must say.  Before my entry really gets underway, I'd like to say a big thank you to Jesse Wong for letting me, Gavin and Josh raid his house for the evening for a time of jamming, Speed Scrabble, and just catching up, and of course the pizza =P. I know, with experience, that having all of us over is not an easy task  *seeing Jason, Josh, and Gavin emptied my fridge last time* and I'd like to thank him for enduring through the 4 hours that we were chillin' at his place. It was cool to catch up with one another, and just to pull out the old memories and thewhat's been going on with HYPE, what's been goin' on in our lives, and of course the crazy adventures that Jesse always has in store to talk about haha. So yeah, thanks a lot man new about  =).  So my day started off this morning at 11am, waking up from a refreshing 9 hours of sleep. Waking up, I ate lunch first, sat on MSN for a bit, and then headed out to Cherryhill to do my Tech Tutor volunteer at Cherryhill.  So from 1-3pm I would work at Cherryhill. During the first hour, I was literally BORED out of my mind, the only thing probably keeping me occupied was the 3rd book of the Left Behind series which I read snippets of, and also the local papers. Eventually though things started picking up at around 2pm, when an older man asked me if I was a volunteer. So I replied yes I was, and then another person asked me something regarding hotmail, which I solved fairly easily. Eventually I would go on to answer around 7-10 questions in the next hour, which did help the hour go by a lot quicker. Also I'd begin to talk with this 9er about Orchard Park since he apparently graduated from there this year. I actually never really noticed how many people use the computers at the library. So in the end, I did do some work which I'm actually thankful for or else I would have been bored out of my mind, and left my two hour shift at 3pm happy =).  Walking home, I got home around 330, and then ate some food, and then SCed with Gavin until 530 when I had to leave for Jesse's place.  Finding his place would have been much easier if I had put down 283 instead of 238 Windemere Rd. I was lucky he wrote down Beaver Hall or I would have NEVER found the place. So lucky he did, and eventually I did figure out where his place was, as Josh and I would find each other looking for his place and then we would then find it. We were the first two there, and had the honour of meeting Jesse's roomate Mark who also grabbed some Pizza, and also met a fellow dentistry pal Ada *I think I got the name right.* Wait....did she do dentistry even? Uh oh....yeah....whoops haha. But she left early anyways, so when she left, Gavin had arrived. He was late as some driver's car went "dead fire" on an intersection which got Gavin's mom really peeved. So he got to Jesse's a bit late, but no worries, we still had time to talk and everything. It was pretty cool catching up with each other. Mark was a med student so talked to him a lot, Josh and I told them about our high school days, and Jesse had one REALLY cool piece of news...   MIKE LIM IS COMIN' BACK FOR MED SCHOOL!   So yeah that's an awesome thing. Also Jesse has TOTALLY upped his guitar equipment. He has a SHWEET Yorkville amp now *which would later turn Josh's acoustic into a bass* and a Wam-Wam pedal. SOOOOOO NICE. Me and Gavin would look at that thing in awe, as it is a Wam-Wam pedal. So after chillin' in Jesse's room for a bit, pizza came, and we all dug in. Mark also joined us, and we eventually would spend an hour and a half talking about sports while we were eating haha. Also me and Gavin would show off our extremely lame sense of humour that we use sometimes, and we responded with the *ehems* and *looks around pretending nothing just happened.* Afterwards we had a few rounds of Speed Scrabble *I came in 3rd or 4th overall,* and I saw the lowest Scrabble score of all time.  Gavin managed to score a 15.  He had a nice set of words, but problem was he never used his X's, Z's, K's and stuff, so eventually he got deducted down to a total of 17. So next game he had a word worth 36 alone and Jesse exclaims:  "Gavin, you just beat your last score with just that one word. GOOD JOB!"  So after that, we then decided to have a mini jam-session before we left. So there were them with their 3 guitars, Josh using Jesse's amp to imitate a bass, and me...  with a cardboard box for a bass drum and a tupperware for a snare. Cymbals and toms were beyond our reach.  So we jammed around for a bit, me wishing I had at least a hi-hat, and before we knew it 10pm had come around the corner, and was time for us to go. But yeah, tonight was good times. Only thing we were missing was a drumset, and more time haha. Like I said before, I thank Jesse for toleratin' with kids like us for 4 hours at his place, and also I would also like to thank God for just keeping us in touch with one another still. That I didn't mention before =P.  Well anyways I'm back home now. Unforunately Calvin missed tonight, but there will be other times. So yeah today will be remembered for awhile. Josh took some pics, hopefully he'll post 'em up soon ehehe.  Anyways I'm out for now. Gotta get sleep for tomorrow. Josh and Gavin are coming over for worship practice for Friday, and on Friday us and Carmen are going to be doing worship practice for Saturday. Maybe I'll be able to fit in some time to work out tomorrow.  Anyways that's another day. Me as an average shmoe I got enough to think about for one day haha.  Later.
