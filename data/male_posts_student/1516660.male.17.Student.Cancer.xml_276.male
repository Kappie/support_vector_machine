Yeah...HaHa.     Okay...today leh, I was kinda in a wreck. About the posting of results lor. Hann also. He's so scared.  I was like feeling scared for the wrong reasons lor. I was kinda scared that my appeal is successful.  Okay, later on, the Mr Whoever (in-charge of planning of classes) said that 70% of the appeals are successful. I was like "What?" and I prayed that I am in the 30%. Oh my god...i am getting so desperate.   We had this mass dance first. HaHa. We danced lotsa lotsa times. After mass dance, we began making costume for our mascot. Me, Mingyao and two others worked on our knight's cape. HaHa.  After that, we went to the telematch. Yay!! We Zulu won all the 4 matches in a row (last 4 matches...we got second for the first match)! YAY!!!! We did Zenith proud man! Go Zenith!! Yes, you cna guess. I had fun. :)  Okay...at the end right..me and Hann found out that our appeals are unsuccessful. (Oh my god! My prophetic dream came true! I am a Seer!! O.o) Hann wanna go appeal, but I don't want to stay onto PJ le. I already made up my mind from the start. The v.p told us that Bio is full le. Bullshit la. If our A-maths passed, I think Bio can still have us lor.   At the end right, Zenith got champion!!! WEEE!!!! Zenith Zenith! Waah lang zee Zenith phua bey ton! SONG BO (In Hokkien means that Zenith is unbeatable! It's part of our cheer)!! WEEE!! Zenith Zenith Zenith....Zenith!!  Okay....me and Hann went to Causeway Point lor. I wanted to find Wendy to talk, and to eat there also. Me and Hann go eat first, finding Wendy later. I ate the what, Claypot Chicken Rice. Eeee... the rice so chao ta one...not nice. I am so hungry now!  We went to find Wendy at the Metro storeroom. I was caught by two supervisors, and almost got Wendy into trouble. Luckily, her supervisors were like "closed one eye" lor...At first they were angry la...but they very lenient de... We moved to the open to talk. Me, Wendy and Hann talked. About our choices. About working in Metro (I went to the counter and got address for HQ). About this and that.  Yeah...I went away at 7, when my father called and told me to go home.  Actually hor, I already made plans. On Friday, I will go to Metro HQ to interview. Sat I go to Open House. Tomrrow, I have a choice of going to YJ or staying at home. See what my mother say first. HaHa. WQ they all can help me sneak in. HeHe. I just wanna experience how lecture is like lor. If I never experience, I will be doing an injustice to myself. HaHa.   I gotta go now. Ya know...watch Charmed. That's why my blog is so rushed. Okay? See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
