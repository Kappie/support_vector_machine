Alright. I was playing my game as usual when Jean announced that a pair of tickets was to be won. I decided to try my luck, ya know. I called and called...about 5-6 times. Then, I finally dialled through. Oh my.... Should I hang up? I decided to call through...  "Hello! Perfect 10! This is Jean here! Congratulations! Can you leave me your particulars?" OH MY GOD!!!!!!  After giving her my particulars, she asked "Can you sing us a song?"  "Perfect by Simple Plan?"I rehearsed a lot a lot of times, but today, I just cna't seem to sing it right! "Oh god...I am too nervous"  "Don't worry...breathe in....You want to try another song? Michelle Branch, Liberty X, Black Eyed Pea..."  "I think I wanna sing Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now. Er... Could you look me in the eye, and tell me that you are happy now, woah woah woah...." My song sucks...I was shaking all over.  "Great! You need to be louder, okay? You are too soft! Alright, wait a while.... (Say something about the previous song) Alright! We have our lucky 10th caller! Hello Kelvin!"  "Heya!"  "How are you now?"  "Oh...I am a bit sick, down with a minor fever, but I am quite alright, I guess." Why am I reporting my sickness?  "Are you ready to sing us a song, Kelvin?"  "Sure...I am singing Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now. Er... (breathe in) Could you look me in the eye, and tell me you are happy now, woah woah woah... Heh. It kinda lousy, my pitching is very lousy" I was so so so nervous!  "You did well! You got the tone and words, well done! You won yourself a pair of tickets to the MAA! Who would you like to dedicate this next song to?"  "Er...Manda, Wendy, WQ...I am too nervous to remember my friends name (laughter from Jean)...Those of you tuning in right now, you know who you are!" Oh my...I am quite blushing.   "Alright, enjoy this next song from (forgot le)... Kelvin! Congrats! You can pick up your tickets at the Mediacorp TV reception. Please bring along your IC, yeah? (some okays from me). Bye bye!!"  OH MY GOD! After days of calling and trying, I finally got through!!! I WON THE TICKETS!!! I jumped around and around!! I am so happy! I called Wendy, who shared the excitement with me. After that, I called WQ! He was so happy! He wanted to go to the MAA. Hmmm.... This begins a exciting audition process. I am offering my ticket to Wendy, Amanda, Arman, Hann and WQ. O.O  I continued playinig my game, but of course, I quit soon after because I am too happy to kill little creatures. Heh Heh. Hmm....I began to devise my audition process. Amanda quit because she got work on Sat night (such a pity...). There's the elimination round, the semi-finals and the finals. The elimination round is basically  those who has a significant other cannot go due to committments with their partner (MAA is on Valentine Day). The semi-finals consists of several questions set by yours truly, which will determine who goes into the finals. The procedures finals has not been decided yet though. Right now, only WQ got into the finals. Right now, there are three places in the finals (including WQ). If anyone quits, I am gonna limit the finals to two (because the rest will get in by default). Complicated process, I know. Oh meow! I am gonna have fun auditioning.   Oh meow. Now, what do I have to say? Ehh...my fever's gone? HaHa. Actually, I don't know what to say le. I am still overwhelmed by my lucky win! Meow moo!!  I think I am going off le la...Heh Heh. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
