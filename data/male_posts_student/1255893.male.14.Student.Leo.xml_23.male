Some kid was showing his peers some journal of his. They began to read it and started to laugh at him. I saw him again during lunch and he was still being taunted. I was sickened and disgusted by that. That little 6th grader had the courage to show his thoughts and feelings at a time when its considered fruity. Those little pieces of shit obviously have no compasion and heart. If you don't care for what someone feels, why laugh? I bet those kids will end up talkin to a psychiatrist about how they have repressed their feelings ever since their friends decided that sharing thoughts was gay. Yet the little kid that individuated from the boundaries his peers set for themeselves will lead a normal life. He will have an easier time talking to others about his problems and if he's smart,better friends than those.   This is a lesson for all to learn from...................................Be brave enough to be yourself. If you're not, we'll all be robots,and robots are boring.
