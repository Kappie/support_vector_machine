"'Europeans are surprised to hear that John Kerry is talking about America the same way as George W. Bush does,' the paper said. 'They are amazed that at the Democratic Convention in Boston, he saluted like a soldier, one hand up at his temple.  They would prefer not to hear it when Kerry promises that he would never hesitate to use force in case America is under threat. They are disappointed.'"    Get that?  Europe is disappointed that we would use force when America is under threat.  You really want any administration that spends more than two minutes worrying about European concerns expressed as they are here?
