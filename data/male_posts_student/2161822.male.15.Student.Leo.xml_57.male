What did you think something exciting actually happened? Didn't think so. Wow PJAS was a huge waste of time. Well at least I'm not doing it next year. Screw perseverance. Oh yeah. I need people that can play instruments. Specifically a bass player and drummer. Just to jam with. (That means you Ryan). Contact me immediately if you do.  Listen to H.I.M.
