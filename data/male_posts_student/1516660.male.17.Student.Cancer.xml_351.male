She's improved by leaps and bounds. Her first two songs are great...having that 'wow' factor. Yes. Not bad. Worthy a competitor to Fantasia! Her third song was plain. It didn't wow me. Noperino.  Oh yes. Me and Manda was messaging each other, commenting on the show. We are both big big Fantasia fans!'  Yes! Fantasia Barino! Her first song, which I don't know the name, wasn't made for her. We can tell. It just ain't Fantasia. However, she sang it well. Great! At least she saved herself.   Her second song was Summertime. When we heard Ryan announcing the song name, we felt very apprehensive. Fantasia did that song last time and it wowed everyone. What if she can't do as well as last time? The judges are so gonna critisize. Luckily, our worries were very unfounded. She performed the song very well, as good as she did last time, if not better. YaY!  Her final song was Tamayra Gray's song (I forgot the title, and I don't want to go to the AI webbie to check it out. The winner has already been announced...I don't wanna spoil myself). Both finalists have to sing that song. Oh my lord!!! Fantasia did the song loads and loads of justice! She sang it wonderfully great! WOW! She sang it with such a powerful voice, filled with rich emotions! She's just like what the song described. Successful. She cried at the end of her song. I was crying too. Amanda too. We were so so so touched by her song. Oh my god! What a fantastic singer! She holds the honor of being the FIRST singer to make me cry. The best man! I am so buying her album once it hit the shelves!  I went to bed with a smile and watery eyes.  Hmm. Today is rather boring, so I will not talk about today.  Oh my!! The results are gonna show later! Who will win!! Who will win!! Oh my lord!! I am so excited!  Alright..I gotta go. See ya next time with the results!! Night blog! TaTa!
