Caffeine messes with your hormones (makin the whores moan), so I have recently quit that for the most part. Nicotine is not really bad for you, but tobacco is, so I have taken that down to   next subject mike  I am using this blog as a way to vent myself (eeeewwww). It is very therapeutic. I dont know how many ppl read it. I kno rich manka does. He sed he liked it. O well, I will see. I am hoping I will get some comments on my politik rant. i will c. i will c u later.
