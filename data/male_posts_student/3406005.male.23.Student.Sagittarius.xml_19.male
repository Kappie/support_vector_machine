Check out Martin's little civics lesson:   "In a nation like Canada," Martin explained, "we have got to ensure that minority rights are protected when challenged by the majority. And the only way in which you can do this is to have a Charter, which is ultimately interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada."   [Was CTV's use of the word "explained" supposed to be ironic? It was to me.]  You heard it here first, folks. The  only  way to protect minority rights is to have some sort of written bill of rights. Which, of course, means that every other democratic state in the world that does not have such a Charter is sadly lacking in its protection of minority rights. You know, like the United Kingdom, that wasteland of minority repression and persecution.   Martin also harped on about the evil notwithstanding clause:   "I would not use the notwithstanding clause," Martin said. "And if what you're prepared to do is use the notwithstanding clause, then what you're saying essentially is minority rights can be subjected to the will of the majority.   But if notwithstanding is such a grave threat to fundamental human rights, why was section 33 even included in the Charter? That Chretien guy must have been responsible, somehow.
