Im talking to a website and no one seems to be listening to what i say, its not like anyone would acctually sit down a read it. people seem to have a need to blurt out what they think to something that is totally anonymous at the best of times. its a bit like people wondering down the road and talking with raised voices into their mobile phone. theres no need but people think that others need to know. Im not moaning again because i think that writing this stuff is a good release even tho someone might not take any notice of it.  Well thats what i think to all this and yes you can expect me to write what i think even tho i have totally slagged it off.  Dave XxXxX
