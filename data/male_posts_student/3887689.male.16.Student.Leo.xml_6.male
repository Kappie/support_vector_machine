Secret Window  was okay actually, but the ending disappointed me immensely. (Spoiler ahead) The whole split personality thing is starting to get really old. It caught me totally off-guard when they did it in  Fight Club , but I've seen it in five movies since that I could name. Of course, the story  Secret Window  was based on came out before  Fight Club,  but regardless. Despite all that, Johnny Depp, truly one of the great actors of this era, turns in a good performance as usual.  The Virgin Suicides  was pretty good, a captivating story wrapped in layers of mystery (ain't no one rockin' these metaphors like I does). I recommend it.
