Overcome your worst fears  —OR—  Outsmart anyone who tries to screw you over?   Well I’m thinking of the things that I fear and none of them keep me from living a very full and complete life. So I’ll keep my hang ups and go for the “outsmart the a-hole that is trying to screw me”. I hate being played and when I get a chance to take down the jerk wad that is screwing me…HELL YES. You’re going down!  On a much lighter note: Would You Rather...  Be locked in a car trunk during a demolition derby  —OR—  handcuffed to a street light during a riot?   I'll take my chances on the street handcuffed to a light post. First off, handcuffs don't scare me! (no! really?) Secondly, I think people are good in general and I'm hoping for a nice person to come along and help protect me from the evil doers.  My mental state can only be described as capricious. Yet, all through the emotional rollercoaster-ride that is my life, one thing remains the same: I'm emotionally ambitious. Reaching for the stars is one thing, at least you know the stars are there, but what I do is that I reach for things I believe to be to be there, but may well turn out to be only fruits of an optimistic imagination. Try walking through a house blindfolded, and you know that somewhere around where you are there is a staircase. When you get to the stairway its all piece of cake, because you can feel your way up. But when you have no idea where the bloody thing is, its a tad more difficult. But you do know where it is, you can feel it, it must be. So you shift your weight forward and raise your right foot.   I am in the process of moving forward. I am dead scared there will be no staircase to support me, and I will tremble and fall to the floor, hitting my head on the hat-rack on my way down. All I can do is trust in what I know, that the stairs are right in front of me. Time will tell that I, once again, was right. It must be so. I think I'm going through a phase. One of these mythical periods of time us teenagers go trough from time to time, when we just can't be bothered to act like normal people and need something to blame it on. "I'm sorry, I'm going trough a phase", "It's not my fault, I was going trough a phase". In addition to out-of-this-world mood-swings, I'm finding it very hard to make myself do stuff that I should do, but don't want to. Under this category you will find things like; Homework, tidying up my room, calling relatives and thanking them for birthday-presents, giving people and libraries back stuff I've lent from them, preparing for tests (I've made a wreck out of two fairly simple tests within the last week).  So why should I bother? huh? Why should I spent hours and hours teaching myself stuff I'm utterly devoid of interest in when there does not seem to be any point in doing so? Until I (or anyone else) find a decent, believable answer to that, an answer that makes such sense I would have to go with it, I simply can not be bothered with this.  So I need therapy? Yeah, so do you.  [oh, glorious daytime—who would sacrifice you for a drunken night?] I identify seasons by their smell. It doesn't matter if it never snows once all winter long, I will know it is winter the moment I step into the crisp, cold air. My eyes can be fooled by the lack of white, and so can my touch. But even as the sun shines brilliantly somewhere far away, it can never filter through the cold to my nose. This supposedly unevolved organ remembers the way that cold feels inside.  But that's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to tell you that it doesn't smell like winter today. I did not need to see the clear, clean melted snow puddles, nor did I need to hear that it was 40 degrees out. It smells like spring. And I'm breathing as deep as I ever have because nothing feels better than growth, than regeneration. Nothing smells better than potential. And I've been thinking the raising thermometer, no matter how long it decides to last this time, is as clear as any mirrored reflection of me. I am not afraid to be a fool for optimism. Every year I'm ready for this, whenever it comes, because I've always forgotten just how wonderful it is. Kind of like when I'm in some kind of pain and all I can do is waiting for it to pass. The moment that pain is gone—it's beyond amazing. You appreciate your healthy body so much more. And that is why I always say, RELIEF IS THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. Feel free to quote me because I'm right. Not love, not happiness, not success. Nothing can top the feeling of relief. And maybe on some level, love and happiness are tied directly to relief—like relief from being lonely. And that's what spring is. It's a relief from so many scarves and hats and clumsy jackets and ties that bind. It's a relief to see the sun up after 5:00 to feel the warmth in the air just a little closer to your skin, just a little closer to the earth. And beyond that, it's that freedom that invites kinetic energy... those swirling subatomic particles that let us know it's time to move it' time to set going this is your time this is the time to do what you always wanted to.  I never feel so powerful than when the first dripping icicle ruins my hair. I never feel so young than when I take off one more layer, and dance freely. I never feel so alive than when I can listen to the water moving again, after a long confinement. [carefree adventure with change lurking in the wings]  I have been neglectful, and I am sorry. I got a diary without a lock! And have been using it daily to jot down mundane details of each day, lists of what food I've eaten, general pontification. Kind of ridiculous, I know, but I received said diary as a gift from my aunt who threatened - "Now that I'm older I wish I had been writing down every detail of my youth, because my memory is failing and I can't recall." Scary. But I am aware of the power of !CYBERSPACE! as well, so... here I am. For you.  I just started my second semester and have had a brief glimpse of my free time as it whizzes past my ear, flushes down the drain, is forgotten and/or lost. I don't really mind though because I had three weeks of monotony and sleep, and I'm about ready to get back. My first class of the week is the Columbia Chronicle, which is a rather exciting atmosphere. I will be writing a piece a week. Kinda makes me wish I hadn't taken two other writing classes. Ah, well. This is what I do: I write. Being beyond the busy that I am currently will definitely be an interesting experience.  Now, on to our regularly scheduled programming...
