I could do with waking up early, though I got to campus late and will pay for parking for the first time in my Austin career (for being at school...I'm a whore for covered parking downtown).    Corey Pavletich, an old Centenary friend, moved across the street yesterday, and at a time I should have been in bed catching up on the sleep and getting ready for today, he and I were drinking beers at the Showdown with Brian Thomas.  Good times to just sit around and remember a ton of people who never flood through my mind at this point, but who were integral parts of it just three years ago.   Walking home last night, I decided to cut through the alley that runs behind my house...I've never gone back there as no garage relates to it, and it's just kind of there for other folks who rent out back rooms in their homes.  And passing a dilapadated old house with a sketchy wooden staircase leading to the garage apartment, I thought of Tripper's friend Rob, a guy I grabbed beers with about a dozen times last year, and who I've only seen once this year, for maybe five minutes at Tripper's benefit for Andy.  I always liked Rob...we watched Oakland and San Diego at his place last year, smoked a few bowls, drank a few beers, ate some Mr. Gatti's pizza...real good guy with a few problems, but one of those folks you just enjoy going out with.  But living with the Tripster has killed the number of things we go and do out (we used to probably grab beers or something twice a month, now it's never), and that's shut me from Rob.  And as I passed the house, which required the trasversion of the largest of water puddles, I thought about those people in life who I never really got to know, but really wish I had.    And whenever you think about that, you wonder if anyone feels that way about you...who is sitting on a subway, or working in an office building, or eating a hot dog in a municipal park, and sees something out of the corner of their eye that somehow evokes a memory of me, and they think  I wish I'd known Rolin more.   Not better as much as more...you get better with more often.    This is an interesting point in life...Danny Ruiz and I would belittle one of the weaker lines in Kushner's  Angels in America , look at each other, and in a great Emily Vise impression, throw out  Threshold of revelation? But it's kind of true.  Leaving Centenary was more of a struggle than it was a vindication...I was terrified of it, and figured tough love and a cold move to Austin was what I needed.  It worked out for the best, but it was never really the discovery that I wanted it to be...the second time around in Austin was a lot better.  But now, three months away, I'm a lot smarter to the world, and while the fear of poverty and the fear of staying off the career track scares me (much like a well-timed religious politimercial can make me momentarily question if my beliefs are wrong), it's less fear and more excitement.  Of course, it's easy to pine for something when your current life is cake and you aren't working 40 hours of cripe a week.
