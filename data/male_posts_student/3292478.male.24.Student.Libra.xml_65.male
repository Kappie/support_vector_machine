My first piece piece would definitely get stuck on  urlLink Jordan 's ugly mug, but I'd be tempted to get another piece going ready to rearrange  urlLink Victoria Beckham 's constipated features.  With regard to the link to Beckham above, take a few minutes to read some of the messges left about her! Given that the page begins with a plea to write only nice, polite things some of the responses are hilarious. I particularly liked the message from  DW  who expressed dismay that Victoria hadn't been picked as the new Doctor Who, which led her to kill her children and wage war with Norway. Sounds quite reasonable to me!
