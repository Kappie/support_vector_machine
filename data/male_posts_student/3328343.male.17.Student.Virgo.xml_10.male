I'm toying with the idea of selling it, but I love that gun and I like having an extra to lend out so I can always invite people without guns, a recruiting tool if you will. Jared offered me $120 for it and concidering I paid $90 I'd only make $30 and loose a good asset. Yeah I think I'll keep it.  Recently I've been having this nasty streak of naps. I get home and decide to just lay on my bed for a little bit, and when you got music playing and you're all nice and comfortable the next think you know it's 2 hours later and you're all nappish. I got up and sat at my computer. I stared at me computer screen and had no idea what to do, I didn't even know what the heck to think. I just sat there for a good 30 mins trying to wake up.
