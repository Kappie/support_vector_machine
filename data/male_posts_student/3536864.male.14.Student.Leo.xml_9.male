The costume desginer was a real duck...that's right, a duck, because they had no taste. I don't think ducks have tongues that can taste like human tongues. He's supposed to be this guy that can go through amazing stuff. But he gets shot and schooled. Then he becomes the king of the greatest empire of the world just like that. Not a bad spot, but no plot....not even a turn..Just hopping from one place to another as randomly as  a frog burping in a pond. Oh yes, that random. Don't see it, the worst 5 dollars i ever spent. Actually, the worst cause i ever spent 5 dollars on; nothing wrong with the dollars.                                                      Time to sleep.
