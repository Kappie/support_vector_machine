       
      Pieces of me fall like stars onto a black canvas night sky. The salty fish smell of the sea says it all.  Life.  Everywhere, I see traces of what once existed so vibrantly.  Now urbanized.  destroyed.  Maybe some day we will turn back the clock.  The sad state of so many heartbroken fellows bitten by commercial greed. So many things target them.  Books, songs, TV. Lonely is a way we all feel.  Not just the codependant or lust ridden, but all mankind. Money, Money, Money - is everyone weak and waiting to get taken? I'm starting to think so..
