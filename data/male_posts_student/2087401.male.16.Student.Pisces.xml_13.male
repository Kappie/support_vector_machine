But if the fairy died the young princess would die too, so we couldn't kill it.  So we went to the zoo.  The dragon man who couldn't fly was named Roshan.  I was wearing my bathrobe and green tights.  Since I was wearing green and Roshan was green, and the swirly things couldn't attack green things, we fought the swirly things and won.  All of this made perfect sense inside the dream.
