Now is the time that the Lord is going to be doing some "house-cleaning" in His body so he can bring us all to new level.  There are a few things we have to know first before He can take us to this new hieght.     One: That the Lord is above all things and His beauty and perfection is far more majestic then even the most beautiful thing we could ever see or try to fathom while here in this world.  He and His ways are completely without flaw no matter how strange or uncomfortable it may seem to us, some things that He does may seem hard or even like they aren't helping us at all, this is because this world clouds our view. What we see is corupted by the wicked ways of man, and by praying with a pure heart and intention we surrender our eyes and  mind  to God and His will...     ...so pray    Two:  God's ways are sparked by love.  Any move that God has ever done was out of love first, even through punishment He shows us all of His love, He punishes us because He loves us.  It's like a small fat kid getting caught while sneaking a cookie from the jar.  He will be punished by his parents because they love him and don't want him to spoil his dinner.  And because he is fat and doesn't need to become anymore fat.  WE ARE THAT FAT KID!!!!!!  The church is always trying to reach our greedy little hands into the cookie jar and get something that will only last a moment, but in reality we are just spoiling our dinner.  His people, much to often, turn to the world looking for something sweet and scrumcious to curb their desires, when in actuality we are only filling up on the wrong things.  Cookies are good but they aren't very healthy now are they?  But if we His people who were called by His name turned to him and asked Him for dinner we would get something that would not only curb our hunger, but it would fill us up much longer than anything that the world would ever be able to offer us.  We need to turn from the world to God and ask for our dinner:  His love, gifts and an awesome relationship, and the main dish the Holy Spirit who is God...      ...so pray    Three:  It's about time that we need to stop saying that we have faith and start proving it.  The Lord was speaking to me a few days ago and this is a summary of what he said, "WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING!?!?!?!?".....was that too vague?  Okay, supposedly there are around, eh, thirteen million people who say that they are christians.  Now I'm sure that number is much smaller in actuality but for now let's just go with that.  Ok "thirteen million" christians on the planet right now, so why dosen't it seem like it?  I'll tell you why because we aren't sharing our knowlege of the truth with anyone.  If there were only ten thousand actual loving christians on this planet, and each of them shared the name of Jesus with, like, twenty people that God gave us everyday with all the love, compassion, and grace we had and only three people (that's three for every single christian of the ten thousand christians we began with) accepted Jesus as their Lord and savior then thirty thousand people would be saved everyday.  That's 30,000 people everyday, and if each of those christians, new and old, saved three more people everyday then in one year around 328,510,950,000 people would be saved (give or take a million or two), now remember that is if there were only ten thousand christians on the face of this planet.  There are millions of us!!!!  OK let's take a step back, our number of christians in one year is threehundred and twenty-eight billion fivehundred and ten million-nine-hundred-and-fifty-thousand.  Then funny thing is there are only around six billion people on the face of this plant so the world would be save fiftyfourbillion-seven-hundred-and-fifty-one-million-eighthundred-and-twentyfive-thousand (54,751,825,000) time over.  And remember this I'm only calculating ten thousand christians, not thirteen million!!!  What are we so afraid of?  Let's look at the worst thing that could happen, we are killed, martyred for Christ.  Sounds pretty cool to me, if I have to die I think it should be while I'm doing something for Jesus, that's the way I want to go.  Ok... sorry where was I...oh yes, we are martyred for Christ, were are we going?  That's right to heaven and we will be rewarded by God for our commendable deeds.  Now I'm not saying that to go out and get yourself killed while you are sharing the gospel.  No, no, no quite the opposite, what I am saying is go out and let God use you, no matter what it takes and don't let fear have it's way, fear not for the power in you (christians) is greater than the power that is in them (therest of the world)!       ....So like I was saying God loves you and wants you to step off of the boat onto the crashing waves and let Him use you!!!!     ....so don't hold Him back from using you        and that is how we can hopefully speed up the process in    which He takes us to new levels: casting out our "wieght" or "roadblocks," praying, turning to He who created us and asking for something better, and stepping out in faith.  Warning:  The young person who prophesied this prophsy is very bad at math, but do not worry for he used the calculator on the computer. God Bless!!!!!!!
