I gathered up my stuff, put the dog in her cage, told her to watch the place while I was gone, and headed out to the car. I got in the car, fired that baby up, and thought to myself, "Is there a window open?". I glaned in the back seat to check the rear windows. Well, while all the windows were in their upright and locked positions, the rear windshield was no longer where one might typically find a rear windshield. Instead it was in small pieces all over the back seat of my car. I had been outside about two hours prior to then, and the windshield was definitely intact and inplace at that time. My car is parked right outside my apartment, and due to the wonderful weather we have here, the windows were all open. Wouldn't you think I would have heard something (someone?) hitting and shattering my rear windshield into a bazillion pieces? Yeah, me too. Thankfully, the thousands of dollars we pay in insurance every year will actually do some good. The nice people from some local glass shop will be out in the morning to make everything all better. Isn't that nice.  I watched the Butterfly Effect today. Throughout the movie I kept thinking how messed up it was, then they had to go and give it a happy ending. Just didn't feel right. For the most part I enjoyed it though. Better than I expected considering it had Ashton Kutcher in it.  Some bitch let her dog take a crap in front of our apartment and didn't clean it up today. Next time she does it I think I'll figure out which apartment she lives in and start delivering my dog's poop to her doorstep. I bet she would appreciate that.  That is all.
