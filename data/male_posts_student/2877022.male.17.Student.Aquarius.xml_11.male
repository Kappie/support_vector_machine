Ergo, here you have, a poem from Ian to nus:  I've been watching your world from afar,  I've been trying to be where you are,  And I've been secretly falling apart,  I'll see.  To me, you're strange and you're beautiful,  You'd be so perfect with me but you just can't see,  You turn every head but you don't see me.   I'll put a spell on you,  You'll fall asleep and I'll put a spell on you.  And when I wake you,  I'll be the first thing you see,  And you'll realise that you love me.   Yeah...   HAHAHAHA!!!! Can u imagine? Picture this: 1 day during mths lecture, nus falls asleep on the chair table, then suddenly ian wakes her up . . .and grins. HAHAHAHA!! wonder wat happened the day both were left alone in chinese class to practice oral?  -Elsa
