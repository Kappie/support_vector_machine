Particularly thought this was interesting: "Davis's genius is that he's created the most widely syndicated comic strip in history—with the attendant profusion of plush toys, T-shirts, and themed Caribbean cruises—and yet, through careful brand management, he's largely managed to deflate the naturally occurring cultural counterattack."  I'm not sure we should be praising this behavior (although it's pretty damn smart).
