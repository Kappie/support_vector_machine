I was bored and decaffeinated so we took a stroll down the block to Robin's Donuts so I could grab a coffee. I was generous enough to by my cousin some juice and a muffin. There's my good deed for the day. Even though it was like $2.50, it  is  the thought that counts!  Sodzy never showed tonight. I suppose his woman is more important then me. Which is fine. No Mystic River to watch tonight. I guess I will have to rent the DVD sometime this week since I have been wanting to see it for some time.  Well, just a quick late night update on my life. Feel free to leave comments regarding the posts; I'd love to hear your thoughts or feedback.   .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   I wanted you all to see this messed up picture. Makes me wonder what the hell people are on. The picture is too big for the page so  urlLink click here  to see it. I am assuming someone was on an acid trip?  Night.
