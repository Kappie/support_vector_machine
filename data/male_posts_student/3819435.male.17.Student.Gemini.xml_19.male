We call it Biwwy (retarded voice of "Billy") because it really does have the technological capabilities of a 76 year old that has recently had a labotomy. Anyway, after a long struggle to make the link work I have joined this blog. Good idea, by the way, my dear Geoffrey! I like the communal (right word?) aspectof this. A collaborative effort always turns out peachy in the end.   Okay, so today is Geoff and my year and two month anniversary. That sounds weird. I think we should count by half years at the most now. Yes. Sounds like the right thing to do. Anyway, I must depart. I have summer school in the morning and it is already 1:35 A.M. *sigh* Ahhhh,a night in the life of Katie. Or any of you for that matter. We're all night owls...it must be something in the water.
