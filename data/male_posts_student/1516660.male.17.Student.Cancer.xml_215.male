I didn't think it was dreaded on Sunday. I was kinda confident that I can do well. Or at elast, pass. But, seeing this paper....sigh. Everybody thinks it's easy. I think it's not easy, but not difficult either. I have not much confident. A-Maths is a borderline subject for me. Either pass or fail. And mistakes can easily cause me to fail. I CANNOT fail A-Maths. If so, there goes my dream of majoring Chem in university. Or Bio for that matter. Sigh!! Must work hard for A-Maths 2! Darn darn darn.  Hm. I ddin't study on Monday. I went out the whole afternoon with parents to Ang Mo Kio and Whampoa. Hmmm...go AMK to shop and eat lor. First, we ate lunch.Iate the yong tau foo my brother keeps complimenting about. I hate it. For the simple fact that spring onions and fried onions were added into my mian! I HATE SPING ONIONS AND FRIED ONIONS! Nice to eat meh? So er xin the taste! I can't believe people would willingly pop them into their mouth. When seeing these things floating in my soup, I screamed. And trasferred them into my brother's soup. I said I would scream (at the stall, loudly too) if er xin objects were added. Er! Can't stand those people. Anyhow add garnishes without even asking. HELLO! People have different taste, thank you very much. That's why. I must bring my own stuff and not ask vendors to bring them themselves. This is one sure-fire way of preventing THOSE things into entering my soup.   Er-hmm. Enough about disgusting garnishes and automatic vendors. After eating, we went to Popular to buy textbooks for my brother. Woah!! The booklist is full of mistakes! Mostly mistakes on author's names. Wah! It caused some confusion when we are buying texts, but we solved the problem by comparing the publisher and price list with the list they displayed in Popular. Ha! I won by saying "Your booklist is completely biased! Why buy from there instead of Popular, where you can even get discount? 5% is a lot you know!" I think there's a conspiracy by the school bookshops around Singapore. They would deliberately change some things here and there to confuse parents from buying outside (and getting a discount). Sheesh. Only want to make money. How I know? This year hor, my parents brought my books from Popular (which is a few...the rest were brought in sec 3). The auntie was complaining non-stop about us buying from Popular. Sheesh. And below the booklist (my brother's) were the words "Please buy from school bookshops to ensure accuracy...". A-HA! This means that they are admitting that they deliberately changed booklist accuracy. In some words or so. Anyway, whatever. So long as there are people like me to spot "mistakes", the world would be a better place.  After that, we went to the library to borrow books. I borrowed some books on styles of writing and journalism. :) After that, we went to Whampoa to eat duck porridge. Wah lao! While my father is trying to park his car, some idiot driver hor....moved in front....then decide to move back. And caused a crash! It's only a minor fender-bender on my father's taxi, but the guy said it's not his fault! It's common courtesy to wait for a driver to park his car, then rush forward. Sheesh! These people are the ones causing road accidents everywhere! Okayy...we ate the delicious duck porridge! Heavenly! After that, we went to 933 in Balestier to buy back chicken (their chicken is heavenly too! Ditto for the sauce!).   Okay! After dinner, I watched TV then came online for a little while. Then, it's off to eat chilli crabs! The chilli taste great!! And the crab meat have much more taste than last time's (so bland!). Actually, I ate more chilli than I ate crab meat. HaHa! I always do! After that, watched Are You Hot, then Friends.  Wole up to a bright early Tuesday morning! I studied lets say...till chapter 16...I studied 8 chapters lor. Ha!! I am studying the last 6 tomorrow. I can cope la. 3 in the morning. 3 in the afternoon. Or whatever.   I invited WQ to come over to study in the afternoon. I am afraid he cannot concentrate. We studied from 1+ till 4. At 4, we cooked Mi Goreng (hate that favor). Hmm! Then, after that, we played PS2 lor. We played Need For Speed, which needless to say, I lost. How can I win against a racing talent? Okay, then we played X-Men. You know what? I lost most of the games...to a beginner. sigh! I keep depending on my powers....he keep using brute force. O.o! I lost uterrly using Storm. I won some using Phoenix. HaHa!! Both of them are so cool!   CQ smsed me. He's having a fever and he feels bad about not being able to study! Oh my! I called over immediately! I told him it would be okay! Must rest well and tomorrow study! Ah Ji! I have confidence in you, okay! Don't stress yourself out too much! Get well soon!  Alright....today Holland V a lot of developments! YanYan first don't like TianXiang, then agree to marry him even he says she don't need to. Then, she sad that she's marrying him, and flirts with XiaoXin. Today, JingJing met up with XiaoXin! Oh! How I wish both of them would be together!   Okay...I am currently playing a game with Wendy. It's something like we ask each other who we prefer (insert someone's name) or (another peron's name). Mostly are people in the entertainment industry. HaHa! She finished mine with Jewel. HaHa! I am still asking her! She's currently deciding between Aaron Carter or Westlife. Oh...Aaron won again. I must ask her more! Wahahaha!!   Alright! Gotta go now! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
