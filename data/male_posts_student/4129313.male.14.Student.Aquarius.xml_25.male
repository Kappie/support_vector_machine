The teacher is realy bitchy, and the students are unnessisarily loud, but thats to be expected by most average freshmen, but they'll grow up i hope. I have always hated PE, but I can deal till its over. I got my math book today too.   You don't know how many times I thought the word n00b today, damn I hate how the school computers are so cheap you'll get boged with insufficiant disk space error's just trying to download the ut2k4 demo >:-(   the computers in the middle school were 100x better, atleast with them i can install and play unreal'98 with 32 fps at shit for looks graphics settings. I think maybe somebody can buy them new pc's and put the old ones in a museum. (being serious BTW)
