Maybe I'll actually try with this one since I won't feel like a 14 year-old teeny-bopper...  Who knows?   As you can see, I'm currently leeching off of somebody's pre-made template.  I'd put their name here and give them credit, but I'm not going to bullshit you this time.  The truth is, I'm just too lazy to check to see what creator's name is, not to mention that even if I wasn't too lazy, I still just don't give a damn.  Eventually I'll create my own template, or at least edit this one, whichever is easier...   I might as well update with something some-what informative (yeah, right) since I'm posting here right now.  I just saw episode  urlLink 35  of the popular machinima-based web-series,  urlLink Red vs Blue , entitled "What's Mine is Yours."  As you should know, the Red vs Blue series consists mostly of situational humor which this episode did not stray away from.  Basically, the episode consisted of Church making hopeless attempts to convince Caboose that they've known each other since the war with the Reds first started.  Caboose, however, insists that Church is a rookie, and that his name is one of Martin, Sam, Dave, Tarren or Vivian.  Meanwhile at the Red base, Griff and Simmons argue about how to take care of each other's body parts which were exchanged in order to save Griff's life (actually, Sarge just wanted to make Griff's life even more miserable than it already is) after he was run over by Sheila.  The episode ends with even more great quotes by Sarge such as "We'll be up Pooper Creek without a paddle." and "Driving blind into the --."  I'd give a better review, but it's freakin' 11:49 P.M. right now and I haven't had much sleep all week, so I really don't care at the moment.   As I conclude this post, I'd like to leave you with a  urlLink link  to one of the most interesting and informative web-blogs that I've ever seen (ok, so not really, but I did actually read a couple entries), maintained by some dude(?) who goes by the name of Dana Epp.
