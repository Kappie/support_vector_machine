However she did get to wear a hilarious wig on LC Current so all is good.  I really don't know what I'm doing here except to trumpet "JOURNALCON!"   Edited to add: I remember what I wanted to say. I may be downstairs in the basement when y'all arrive. If I don't respond to the doorbell walk around back down the sidewalk, down the steps and into the back yard. I'll be there, and the door will be unlocked  Hopefully, Y'all check before you come!
