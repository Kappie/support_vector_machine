It is tentatively titled "I need a purse", and sounds a lot like a song from 'Revenge of the Nerds', except you know, cooler. It's also really really basic as of now, only a drum track and keyboard. Expect more soon, such as "guitars" and "more guitars". Maybe we'll even implement some good old fashioned leg slapping, you know, to liven it up. Anyway, drop me a comment and let me know what you think. Hell, maybe you'll inadvertently destroy my will to create music. Go for it!  This song was made using one of my favorite applications, called  urlLink Audacity . They released V 1.2.1 about 2 weeks ago, and it has so many new improvements. I really recomend you check it out if you're at all interested in home recording. The program itself is completely free, and very intuitive. It'll also make you look like a professional when your screen looks like this.    urlLink     In other news, I "picked up" a full copy of ' urlLink OK Computer ' today, from a "friend", named "Alex Yablon". It's pretty much what I expected from those weirdos in Radiohead, and doesn't stray far from the solid rockingness of 'Paranoid Android'. Not to say that it rocks like a rock and roll musical piece, but it rocks me. I also started tuning into  urlLink Belle and Sebastian  on my walk home today while job hunting. It made it a lot more fun when the song 'Step Into My Office, Baby' came on. Good stuff.
