I thought i had everything under control, but i guess i didnt i've no collapsed in on myself, there's too much wrong in my life and not enough right...i just want to be accepted, i dont want to leave my family but in dire times i rather that than be in a 10 by 10 cell...my soul is dead, and my body soon shall be as well. I've gone into a relapse and i'm not sure if i have the strength to fight it this time, i cant take the problems anymore, Suicide isnt a solution but it will set me free! why me, why cant i just be like others, why cant i be normal, what's wrong with me. What have i done in my past life to deserve this. I want to be with people, but all receive is being alone. I cant take it any more.  No one hears me, understands me I speak in silence hoping that someone will see my words, my message hoping to find love, it has arrived so divine I wish for a stronger, better life filled with everlasting touchI dream the future, but hold the past My body is brimmed with so many confusions Am I really here experiencing fullness? I must be, the pain is so real the hurt I feel could never be imagined but I will pull through into greatness and destroy whatever faces into me As I struggle I will fight until the end Whenever it may come  I will try and cope with whatever strength and piece of mind i have left.....
