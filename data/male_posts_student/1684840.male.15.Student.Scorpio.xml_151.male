James said he was okay with it but I'm not so sure.  People were printing off pictures of it and he kept on being violent and aggressive with people, which was totally out of order in my opinion.  Becky should give him one of her 'chill pills' lmao, You know what I mean, Miss Pill Popper ;).  The way he acted was bang out of order...  David didn't grass me up after all; I think he realised it was so pointless anyway.  We had an assembly this morning which ran into a bit of lesson one, which was totally useless in my opinion.  It was to remind us that once Year 11 leave, we aren't to go acting like we 'rule the roost'.  They could have had the braisn to go and hold it on the morning of their actual leaving day so we don't get pelted with eggs and stuff.  I dunno, what's the point anway!
