I wanted to go to the movies wit steph, but my mom told me i was spendin too much money so thats a no no aswell...:(..i guess im gonna talk to her tonite then, cuz talkin to her makez me feel good. Since i was bored...i looked back at my old posts...from the beginning...it started off by complainin about practice in the winter...and now 8 months later im here...wow it has a been a long journey i must say...the lessons i have shared with u ppl throughout those months and documenting my everyday actions and feelinz. When i read the 1st few months i was jus like "pssssh...how pathetic..." and i started to get a lil teary but i controled myself...jus lookin how hurt i was, took me back to where that post took place...i felt that i relived those 8 months again...and if i could change anything about this saga...i wouldnt change a damn thing...cuz now im better than ever...and its awesome...
