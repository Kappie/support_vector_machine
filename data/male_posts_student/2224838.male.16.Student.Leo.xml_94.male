Basically, editor-in-chief oversees the entire newspaper staff, while managing editor takes care of the writing staff and focuses on editing the stories.   Although I was only planning on running for managing editor, I went ahead and threw my name on the editor-in-chief list. I wasn't really trying to get that spot, so I voted for someone else. Anyway, the guy I voted for ended up winning, so the staff next voted for managing editor. Two other people were running for the position alongside me, so it was a trying campaign. It took ten long minutes of graft and vote rigging, but I emerged the victor.    My responsibilities as managing editor start this week with planning the staff and newspaper for next year.
