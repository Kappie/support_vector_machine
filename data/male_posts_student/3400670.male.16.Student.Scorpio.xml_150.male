I have to say that this year has been an awesome year in CLARK's AP US HISTORY class. Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially.   So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced.   Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class!  FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!!  Best Wishes  Thomas Chen
