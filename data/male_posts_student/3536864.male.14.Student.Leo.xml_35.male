But don't think it's easy and I get to slack off all day cause i don't....all you anti homeschool people. Plus we have harder stuff at an earlier age. The US really needs to work on their school systems. Ah well, maybe later.  Today I get to label more notebooks.  Joyousness! Plus tomorrow I get to get up at 8:30 in preperation for getting up at 7:00. Not that early, but that doesn't really matter right now.  On the upside of all this, I don't fully start school until the 30th.  So I'll have plenty of time to practice Maple Leaf Rag. Now it's time for something a bit more exciting than sitting here and typing. Ciao
