Time and time again I put myself through this pain I build up my downfall Thinking you’d change I change myself to seem better to you  And you lied when you said we’d still be friends Well I’m reconstructed from the pieces you’ve broken me into  You use me over and over Thank you, come again Thank you, come again Thank you, come again
