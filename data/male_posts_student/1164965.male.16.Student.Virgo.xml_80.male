I went online and looked up information about Elie Wiesel. I read his Nobel Prize Acceptance speech. Check it out, it's really good.  http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/ElieWiesel/Nobel_Speech.htm I also found some pictures of him. Mostly when he was older, but I found a picture taken when he was 15 or 14 before he was in the concentration camps. It made me think about the end of the book when he's looking in the mirror. I looked at the picture and I tried to imagine what he looked like at the end of the war. Here's a good quote from Wiesel. I think it does a pretty good job at summerizing why he wrote 'Night' and why understanding what happened during the Holocaust is so important.  "I have tried to keep memory alive, I have tried to fight those who would forget.  Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices...That is why I swore never to be silent whenever wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. "
