Time slows down in the building just to piss me off. I was so bored and tired that I made a comp to see who had thew biggest orders (i baggage the food into guess what plastic bags). Its kinda joint at the top :)   At number 3...  A fat guy walks into the shop. Real fat. He was six times the width of me, and a lot more times heavier. I swear, i felt the ground shake when he walked past. His order?  £450 of packaged burgers, hot dogs, meat, and coke and fanta . It was delivered from the warehouse in boxes, so i luckily didnt have to package it. Funny thing was, the guy couldnt get in/out threw the normal door, so he had to go in/out through the warehouse doors X-D   At number 2...  A woman takes 2 trolley worths of food plus a mass order from the warehouse. I was like holy fuck! I was busily for 5 minutes packaging her stuff and then her husband comes through with another trolley worth. :'( Total order?  £790  It must have been their shopping for the year or something.   At number 1...  A man comes on Wednesday with a £450+ order of food. Not that big. He then comes on Saturday with another £450+ order. £ 900+ worth of food in four days ? I'll use a James qoute: " Go figure :/ "  At least i'm getting paid for this. At the end of 8 weeks I will have around £400 for working 2 days a week. Enough for a Nice Gryffin or Dita hockey stick and a iPod maybe?  Its all fun I tell yer >    Tribute to thy baggagingness,  Dragontail
