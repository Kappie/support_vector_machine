All that will be left will be me, Big Brother, food, revision (well attempting), and Laura who I guess will be just down in dear old Brixton shagging her lover. So I'm on my own, with no Cardiff in site and just a little pub treck before even the great Ian goes on holiday also. So I really might from Monday force myself into philosophy revision. I know I've basically fucked up my other two subjects so I've really just got to just pass this subject if I have any chance of going to Uni next year *sigh* xBuBzx
