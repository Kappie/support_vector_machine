God's love is forever, infinite, and unconditional. our love is a fallen form and mere shadow of that love. our love is frail, conditional, weak, and subject to change. sometimes i lose sight of all this, and i reach for what is, to my distorted perception, the closer form of love. the human kind. it is during those times that i forget one so very important thing... God's Spirit is alive in me. He is right here inside me and all around me. His love is only a prayer away.    Father, help me... remind me at all times and every moment of Your love. without it, i cannot live, i cannot continue. Lord, thank you for Your love. Your love is pure and holy, infinite and unconditional, and last but definitely not least - eternal. in Your Son's Name i pray, Amen.  ”  End excerpt.  This excerpt was previously released on Ezra’s Xanga. ]  I have released this post in hopes that you might all benefit from it.  At the time, I was in great emotional distress and spiritual confusion.  I had been searching for love and acceptance in all the wrong places.  This breakthrough came by the grace of God, and began my road to recovery.  It led up to, but did not end at, my baptism.  Perhaps you will be able to learn and take encouragement from it.  Take care, guys… talk to you all soon.     With love that is but a shadow of the love of Christ,  Your brother in Christ – Ezra Chang
