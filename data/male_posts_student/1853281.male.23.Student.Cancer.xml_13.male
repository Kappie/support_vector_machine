It's a night class, we don't have time to talk. Let the proff lecture!! I swear, sometimes i want to ban dumb people from my college. Especially the large amounts of dumb people who turn my history classes into excercises in frustration. Went to Annies with Keith afterward and drown my sorrows in chicken fingers and a hot fudge sundae only had two or three spoons of the sundae, dairy so does not even taste good anymore.  Been home for 2 and a half hours, not sleepy. this insomnia this is so played out. I really need the sleep, i need to get up and to class tomorrow. I need to clean my house, which has suddenly morphed ino the pit of death, I almost broke my ankle tripping over three books which were covered with random knitting and then a pizza box. listened to tonight Magnetic Fields 63 love songs volume 2 Kylie Minogue Ella Fitzgerald The Smiths- Louder than Bomb and Orff- Carmina Burana Time to got to sleep.
