Laura's been on for a sec, long enough to find out that she's alright, so that's a real plus, but other than that today has been slow at best. And my head is hurting and everything... I'm being a whiny git but I'm not with it at the moment.  *long, low frequency whine* I'm just tired, and I've got a blocked throat and everything. It doesn't help the fact that I'm mildly depressed anyway as a result of being a teenager, so it's all a big pile of poo.  I've been described twice recently as "lovely". I'm not... entirely sure of what is meant. What I assume it to mean is that I'm nice, and it's an alternate word for saying that, you know? I can't really think of any other meaning. It's the only one that comes to mind. But I am famed for getting the wrong end of the stick. I don't know how I could get the wrong end of the stick here, but if anyone could I'd be the one to do it, let's be honest. I think I'm getting a bit peculiar.  Suz is stealing the net at 6, hoping I can get it back to talk to people... alright, I lie, to talk to Laura, but still. Maybe I say that too much on here. I don't know, answers on a stamped, addressed envelope to Blue Peter... I'm just tired, really. I don't really talk much to anyone else.  I'm tired, a little depressed, but not entirely unhappy. I reckon something good's going to happen to me soon.  Quote of the day: "It's only just out of reach, Down the block, on a beach Under a tree...
