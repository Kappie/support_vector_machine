I didn't go though because I didn't feel like it.  Sam didn't want to have the sleepover this weekend so we're gonna have it next weekend instead.  The weather today was great and everyone turned up to Sam's little BBQ party (EVENTUALLY *cough* James and Craig *cough*) and we had some food and played the pole tennis game thing Sam had.  After the food we all legged it into the house, literally, to watch Sam's Flash birthday message I made, which sings Happy Birthday then as it finishes pops up a funny picture of Sam and screams Mwahahahaha! :D  We then went up to Sam's room and chatted a bit and listened to Kerrang! Radio (105.2 FM, brand new station it's wicked!) and I got onto Sam's laptop mwahahah, he thought nobody knew his password but I got it!  Tee Hehe...  After that we all went outside to play a very tiring game of Manhunt where we all got a bit out-of-breath and stuff.  My asthma is dreadful this time of year :(  It then started to go dark so we made our way back to Sam's house and we just hung around there for a bit until we started to go home.  Today was great!  Pics are up in the gallery for the people out there who can't put together a mental image of what our day was like :P
