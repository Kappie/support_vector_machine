He met up with Skippy and Karla and Dudely Doo (and others who don't actually have names yet but probably will at some point) and they tried to watch the cheer tryouts.  They had fun trying to devise ways in which they could watch it for free but they didn't get to be there for long.  So after a long time there the cheer tryouts finally ended.  Tyke talked with Haras and talked about doing the Swinging'n'Sweets thingy but he said he probably wouldn't come.  And he didn't but at least he was honest.  Anyway, a bunch of people went to Jamba Juice and that was fun.  Then they all left and Tyke went home for about 15 minutes before Skippy called to tell him where he was going out to dinner.  So Tyke went up to Skippy's house and picked him up to go to Bell Square and Red Robin.  They met up there and ate and then left.  At 8, Kinker, Skippy, Amed, Macaroon, Little Twigg, and Naan all came over.  They played cards and 10 fingers and song guessing and managed to have a pretty dang good time.  Then they went to Krispy Kreme and came back after that.  Everyone left then.  It was a really fun day.  Nothing like any of the past days had been like.  So today rocked.  And Tyke is tired/sicker than he was yesterday.  So he needs to get some sleep now for tomorrow is a busy day as well.  Here we go!
