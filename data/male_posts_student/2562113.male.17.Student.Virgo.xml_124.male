Paul, being in the mob that he is, tried to bribe the cops. I went to Amanda Leanard's afterwards. I have yet to actually see this girl Amanda even though I've been to her house about 4 times now. Then I went to bobs with 15 minutes to spare before the new year was ushered in. At 12:01, I went to get BK, desiree, doug, and jes mcgannon from amanda lenards because they were stuck. It took them 20 minutes to leave, which did annoy me. Anyway, back to bobs, it was fun. Everyone was being Dr. Phil which is a good thing, I suppose, but annoying when you want to have fun and are being told not to disturb people every which way. Let's just say there was a lot of "tree blocking" last night. Anyway, its 2004. Whooopdi fucking doo. Rockland still sucks...people in rockland suck....life sucks. O well.   -Suicide Smutter
