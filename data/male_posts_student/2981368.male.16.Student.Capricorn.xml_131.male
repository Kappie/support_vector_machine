But interestingly enough, if Switzerland manage to beat France, and we loose to Croatia, we go bottom of the group.  "If teams finish level on points, then the winner of the match between the sides in question will finish highest, or should they have drawn, goal difference, followed by goals scored, qualifying record for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2004â„¢, a fair play ranking and finally either a penalty shoot-out or drawing of lots."  This is quite strange...the first few ones make sense: goal difference 'n' all, but then it gets all screwey. Qualifying record for the 2002 world cup?! Thats fairly insane. Fair play ranking is even worse...that means one team could go ahead of another because they were more friendly. Drawing of lots would be incredibly funny. Unless it happened to us and we lost. But imagine that. Teams  drawing lots  to decide who goes through.   And all of a sudden, I want Latvia to start winning. This guide to the teams I was reading described the stereotypical Latvian fans as "Ice hockey fans looking for a change of scene". So yeah. GO LATVIA!
