Portugal losing and France scoring two goals in second half injury time to win the game. I still cannot believe it. I had already accepted my fate that France is going to lose the game and how the media will be going about France failure to win but sometimes miracles do happen.It is not over until it is over.   I almost burnt my kitchen down. choy! But really. I was making some hotdogs in the oven. It was during the France and England game. I set the oven to ten minutes to cook the hotdogs. I went to watch the match. I totally forgot to go and check the hotdogs.  After about 20min, I smelled something burning. I said, "OH! sHIT" to myself. The hotdogs were totally burnt. What rotten luck? I was so hungry that I just I ate bread. After throwing the hotdog away, I went back to the hall to watch the game. I should be more aware of things like that. I cant blame myself as I was totally engrossed in the game. But in the end I was smiling as France won. This is only the beginning.
