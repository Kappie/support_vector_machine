Not having school today just gave me another day to procrastinate on my homework, some of which I have not done as of yet. Namely mi espanol (damn computer won't do spanish characters).  Review of weekend: Overall, a pretty good weekend because of the extra day, but kind of a boring, stuck-inside-the-house-because-it's-raining weekend. Except for Amanda's party, of course. That was great! Grrr...I should have played piano there.  A few moments from the party: 1. Hannah Lagoon stands outside barefoot in the snow for 30 seconds, thus receiving 25 cents from me. 2. Multiple people try to drag me into the room with the piano (I didn't have my music). 3. Again, multiple people (not including myself) get high off of pure sugar, and, of course, caffeinated soda. 4. When I had just got there, I was barely paying attention to anything, and thus, lost crucial parts of conversations.lol 5. When Amanda realized that the face of Lincoln on my 5-dollar bill was replaced with the face of a cow. Seemed like the theme of gifts was cows...  Ack, I have to keep reading Stardust. I haven't really gotten going yet. Oh, and by the way, American Gods is a good read.  The New Five for Fighting album, The Battle for Everything, is scheduled to be released this Tuesday. I plan to BUY it this time, and not wait for the library to get it and burn it. I've kinda stopped doing that now. I have too many blank cds floating around as it is.  Despite this weather, it's possible to ride a bike up to In Concert-at 7:30 at night, on a white road bike (that got covered with road shit). What fun.  I never thought I'd get it done, but the English play review is finished as of this afternoon. Thank god for 4 day weeks. And we still get study halls! wootwoot. hmm....what to do next weekend...
