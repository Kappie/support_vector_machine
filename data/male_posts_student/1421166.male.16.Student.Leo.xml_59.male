Thanks to all the people who gave me the support during the heavy practice days.   Then I went to Suntec with my SPG to have our gathering. It was really nice la. Talking to Emilia and all...hehe...band enthusiast! Somemore she's a clarinetist too. Everytime I talk to her, I start to feel enthu about band too...cos she always is. hehe...And then we had dinner at Sky Garden, Followed by a sharing from Lincoln. It was very much a good reminder and evaluation of ourselves la. Then we were talking bout being Christian students la. And then, I remembered about Jamie Sullivan from "A Walk to Remember". She is a Christian. And what meant most in her life was her faith. And she was never afraid to show it. Even at the expense of her popularity, or in her case, more of being normal.(what the rest of the teens thought la) And I think she's a really good example, although she's fiction. I really hope to be like her...always showing love to those around her. Well, guess I'll have to depend on God.
