I'm now happy with my band and everyone in my band is very talented and now I realized there alot greater than I first thought they were. So now the list of songs below are just songs I would like to perform. Though I'd rather be cool with the Spooner Street Mafia with our kick ass originals. I love us.    Covers I Would Love To Play In Concert   A Perfect Circle -  The Outsider and Pet  Metallica - One, Master of Puppets, Fade To Black, Enter Sandman, No Leaf Clover  Any Beatles songs, preferably Hey Jude or Come Together, Day Tripper  Boston - Peace of Mind, Foreplay/Long Time, Rock and Roll Band and Smokin  Any Rush song, preferably Spirit of The Radio, Tom Sawyer and Anthem  Any crowd pumping ACDC or Guns N Roses song  The Who - Teenage Wasteland  Styx - Come Sail Away, Mr. Roboto and Renegade  Dave Matthews Band - Ants Marching  Foreigner - Juke Box Hero and Long Way From Home  Kiss - Rock N Roll (Concert Version)  Any Led Zep song, preferably Rock N Roll, Communication Breakdown, Since I've Been Loving You and Stairway To Heaven  Police - Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic and Message In A Bottle  Queen - Bohemian Rapsody  REM - It's The End of The World As We Know It  The Darkness - Christmas Time  T Rex - Twentieth Century Boy  Creedence Clearwater Revival - Up Around The Bend  Eric Clapton - Layla  Billy Joel - We Didn't Start Fire  Goldfinger - 99 Red Balloons
