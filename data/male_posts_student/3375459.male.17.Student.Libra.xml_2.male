Lets see what did i missed out at work, stuff at the 2nd story is cool man, ploycarbon car body add-ons. Then there was this uncle who came along, wanting use to polish the cars, he said "not that i want you to work, but in fact we're teaching you all a skill" *sneeze* sure is cold right now. Anyway, we continue back down to the 1st storey, the reception room where we place our bags in. We were to ask to check scale models of cars (already built), NIceee~ HEhheeee do them sell them there? Hopefully after blogging this i can at least get some thoughts out of my head, should be empty enough to have a good night's rest. I think I Should go for another try to enter dream land... Everybody, have a good night's rest! =)
