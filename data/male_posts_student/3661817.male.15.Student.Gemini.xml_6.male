Its like GTA combined with The Getaway. All in all a good day.  Like 45 minutes after i came home with my grandfather, my friend Greg IM'd me and told me he was going to McDonalds. He asked if i wanted to go along with him. I said ok, and suprisingly my mom agreed to let me go. So after around a 10 minute walk i arrived, and after a 10 minute wait, they arrived. They being greg, my friend alex, and this kid i met once before named... Ben! Thats it, ben. We ate some McDonalds then ventured to the local Barnes and Nobles.  When we got there, Greg and Alex ran abck to Mcdonalds to go get another friend of ours, Chris. THe funny thing was that as they left for McDonalds, chris came into barnes and nobles. Me and ben jsut stayed in barnes and nobles reading some stupid books.  At one point i went to call my mom, and bumped into my wrestling teamate Ben. We talked about how chill Le Parkour was for a bit,  and how i should go to a jam with him next time. I agreed, and then continued to call my mom.  After that, greg told me the same guys were going to NYC tommorow to watch the movie, Fahrenheit 9/11. I wanted to go, but when i aksed my aprents, the answer was no. Gah, but they did say maybe next time.  I came home, and my dad opened a package taht someone gave him at work. 2 bootleg dvds.... he didnt even want them. We watched one, and it was crap, then we watched another, and it was better.  So today was a goodday, and tommorow should be good also considering that i am picking my bike up. w00t! so happy about that.  Well, thats all for today.  Until Next Time.
