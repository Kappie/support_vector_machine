     
      So maybe I have a muscle tear around my waist. More Mon. afternoon. The trip into the city was, for the most part, a waste of time, though I did get a nice packet of info for when (WHEN LORD WHEN) I start a new job. I'm thinking about hiring a headhunter and then moving to Evanston or Chicago.      PS Sammy, man the fuck up.
