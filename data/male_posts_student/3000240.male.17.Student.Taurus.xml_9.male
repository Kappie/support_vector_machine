Well; whoever you are who reads this more than perculiar site, this is a short history lesson in my self-procclaimed bubzification . . . My full name is Matthew Edwin Jack Smith, I'm 16 (17 in 3 weeks yay), I live in West Molesey, Surrey in the UK. Im a rather disproportionately shaped looking bloke (ie ugly to non politically correct/normal folk). I go to Esher College which is about a mile away from Hampton Court where I study sociology, philosophy and psychology at as-level. I hope to be a counselor one day. My interests include sport (Chelsea fc especially) and alternative industrial, metal music. I have 1 brother (Andrew 30) and one sister (Joanne 32) and a five year old nephew called Harry. My parents (John and Carol) are both 57 and should be retiring (and die slowly in my opinion) this year. Any hoo that's all I really have to say for myself. Anything else you want know you'd have to ask to me personally. Anyone wants to get in contact with me my msn is matthewsmith157@hotmail.com xBuBzx
