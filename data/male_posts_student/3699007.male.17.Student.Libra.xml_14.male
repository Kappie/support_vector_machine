Me and Britt hung out yesterday and it ended up turning into me spending the night with him because Ashley, Becca, and a friend of hers, and Ashley's momwere coming from Alabama and we all wanted to hang out. It was pretty fun. And here's some earth-shattering news. I drank alcohol. AHHHHH! LOL! I actually drank a relatively large amount and I didn't feel hardly anything. Anyway, so we went to the grocery store at like 10 to buy cokes and stuff because we ordered pizza and didn't have anything to drink, and as we're going in, we all notice (Me, Britt, Becca, and Elizabeth) this strange as hell Asian dude with his arm around a girl walking out of the store and he is staring at us with this evil look on his face.We didn't think very much of it and we walked on in the store. So I'm standing on the drink isle and all of a sudden the guy pops out of nowhere, along with another equally as freaky looking guy (I don't know where the girl went, they probably raped her or some other sinister thing) and the Asian says to me "You from around here?" And I said "Yes, what do you need?" I thought he was going to ask me for directions or something. What came next was a total shock. "YOU threw a rock at my fuckin' car! A '97 Eclipse!" I was like hell no I didn't, you've got the wrong person. Keep in mind this guy is pretty big and had his hand in his pocket like he was about to pull a gun or a knife or something on me. So Britt asks him "Where'd the rock hit it?" And the guy replies "Stay the fuck out of this, this isn't any of your GD business!" So he asks me how old I am, I tell him 17, and he told me to take my faggot ass home and go to bed, to which I told him I'd definitely be doing. He told me that I better watch out when he catches me in a wide open space and that he'd bust a cap in my ass. How pleasant. So, terrified, we quickly got our drinks and I had Britt and the girls go get the car and pick me up at the door of the store and I never saw the guy again. So, other than that, last night was pretty fun. I'll write more later, probably.
