Sadly, whoever used the computers would close the window, rrr.  Too bad I didn't open it in all the MAcs.  That would be a nice  prank , wouldn't it?  Anyway, I also went to this party where there were little immature homophobic kids.  You should've heard what they kept saying.  Talking about how that crappy "Yu-Gi-Oh!" thing is " gay ".  They were so stupid.  Then there was this little girl who came up to me while I was listening to my iPod.  She's like "Can I get a pencil?"  So I ignore her and she's like "Hello?"  She keeps on saying it to me as if she's talking on the phone.  I kept ignoring her, and finally she stated pulling my earphones.  Then, I got mad, no kid touches my earphones without my permission.  I hate that kid.  Once, I had to go to bathroom at this house.  I'm like looking around the place for the can.  I finally find it, but there's someone in there.  They get out.  I go in and the kid just pops up and is like, "Please can I go?  I'm leaking!"  I'm like wtf cuz it's like a four-year-old.  And then I have to wait cuz her mom makes me get out.  Sad people. Later.
