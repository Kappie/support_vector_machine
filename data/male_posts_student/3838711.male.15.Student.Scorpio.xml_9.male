Although the food wasnt so good, the people who turned up were.. =)  But first off, let me blog down the events that happened in school today..   Everything was usual, when during Physics lesson, Mr Ganesh didnt come and instead the VP, Mrs Maria Koh, came in to talk to us.. kinda a inspirational pep talk and a goal setting one at that for us... she told us to be 'what you want to be', must pass the exams and at O levels.. since its a milestone for us in our career life.. She says that we, the retainees, have character, and the spirit to face the syllabus again, and to come to school, only to see that the people in the class changed, but the level hasnt. Still 3. Focusing on my studies is also a point that she stressed, but hey, with my current status, what can assure me that I can pull it off well this semester ? Yeesh, as if things werent going smooth enough, the problem of love has to come knocking at my door this period of my life...   Yeah... and that left me thinking about what i should do right now, to be a lonely driver, or go find one... but its a uphill task, I can say. Became a lost soul again, I might go approach her if i need someone to pour out to, after all, she says her door is always open, and she'll be all ears if anyone has any problem. Hmm.. it aint peer to peer after all... Always an adult coming into the picture in my wretched life...   Headed home after school, and rushed to bath and get ready to go out to Tampines Mall, where we met thebunch of girls and 2 guys... their 'ah pa' and 'ah gong'.. lol... but i'm the oldest there... -.-" Went into Seoul Garden after that, didnt eat too much, i still had a loss of appetite.. but we talked a lot, and i enjoyed it very much. Like i said, i kinda hate boredom nowadays, since it ignites my thinking of my problems yet again.... Used to walk aimlessly on long stretches of road, but now, if I have the time to leisurely walk over a substantial amount of road, I would definitely think of something these days.   Played Final Password (in chinese la) after our meal, the one that gets the number that the judge sets, he/she gets punished.. in this case it was a real exotic cocktail of desserts, and a plate of meat that is marinated with BBQ sauce, Chili, Chili powder, and wasabi. The dessert had raw egg, ice, attap seeds, jelly, and some other stuff that those girls wouldnt reveal... and basket, I didnt even get punished de, until the last round, guess wrong number.... :/ haha.. nvm la, i got tactic, swallowed the food quickly, by the side of my jaws, and thus didnt get the full scale hotness of the chili and wasabi... whahah... see themchoking and blowing, i kinda feel they kinda dumb... one of them took 2 mins to swallow down the piece of meat, but it already took him full scale le.. -.-"   Went to the hp shop to change the 3100, to a T630. Damn, the price of $280 was a white version.. Black one costed $330... felt like cheated lor,Whymobile selling at a nett price regardless of colour.. blah. Will think about getting from that shop. Cheaper somemore. $320 nia. See how tomorrowlor. Besides, Whymobile offers door to door deilvery service, that darn shop doesnt... haha.. chances are high neh...   Yeah that kinda concludes my day... Met Joei again today, felt a sense of attraction to her.. I just wonder if its my heart or my brain... trying to find someone only, orI really like her.. Man i dunno.. Wild shots in the dark ?   Can anyone give me a guide as to what I'm supposed to do... The aimless and clueless me is really in a spot...
