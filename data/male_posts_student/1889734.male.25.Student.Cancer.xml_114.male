Rarely do I agree with him, but this column is full of more intellectual honesty than I would ever hope to see on the pages of the Times.  I wonder if he is being chastised for slipping this one past the Ideological Censor.  While I don't agree completely with his last two paragraphs, he hits it on the head elsewhere.  Take the time to read it.
