Yesterday I received word that I would not be allowed into the nursing program at the College of DuPage.  900 applicants, 120 spots.  Didnt have my hopes up really, but it still got me bummed.  It just the policy that pisses me off though.  Basically, some stupid little slut with a 4.0 out of high school will get the spot while a college graduate with a degree in systems physiology is left wondering what to do next.  I thought I had some chance though, being A: male, B: a college grad, C: had all my prereqs done.  Oh well.  So life isnt fair.  Or at least the system isnt.  Time to do what I have always done when life doesnt work out the way I've planned...  Move on to the next thing.  So basically now every single nursing program in the state will be receiving an application from me.  Forget where or how expensive, this time Im playing for keeps.    Last night though, was pretty fun.  Hung out with Sammy, Bridget, and Rob (another teacher from B's school).  Nice guy, good times.  We all got really good at playing the erotic photo find game.  Good times.  Also, today was sweet.  Ace'd both my biomedical terminology tests.  Also got a mountain dew and a king sized milky way for $1.13.  Cash register girl screwed up the SKU and then I got my pop for 13 cents.  I brought this to her attention, and since it was probably her first day, the manager was standing right there and told me not to worry bout it.  Bueno.  I like free stuff (the pop alone would have been 1.10!).  Tonight is spending time with the family, so that should be nice.  LIfe is ok right now.  Oh yeah, Ive got epidydimitis.  Bummer.  Sure as hell beats a hernia or cancer.  Jun says its from playing with myself too much.  I say its from TKD, the doc says it just happens.  Needless to say, its a pain in my balls.  No, really.  I was being serious.
