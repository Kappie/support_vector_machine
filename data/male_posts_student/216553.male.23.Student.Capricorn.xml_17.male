Last week, as I've mentioned, chemistry grades were rather fishy.  Several students who were not doing so well in the course suddenly pulled the highest grades in the class, which made absolutely no sense considering their apparent understanding of chemistry.  One student in particular didn't know what an isotope was on Monday, nor did they know how to use an X-Y axis on Tuesday.  They also didn't know that the form that carbon dioxide takes in blood is bicarbonate, yet they apparently killed the acids and bases test in chemistry!  So is all this possible?  I don't think so.  I was rather intrigued by these marks and decided to talk to administration about it.  I told them that there may be something up with the marks, and that many students suspect that something may be going on with the grades and that students were lining up to talk to them.  Now, apparently our chemistry professor called a couple students informing them of what's going on after there was a meeting with the administration.  One of the students, a friend of mine, told me that what I did was F'd up.  Excuse me?  "Bay, you should mind your own business..."  Well, so should you ;)  In anycase, my argument was as follows, "It is my business because I have a right, by taking this class and paying tuition, to fair and equitable treatment. It is thus my business because all the students, including myself were not placed on a level-playing field." And yes, I don't think that potentially giving students tests in order to help those who are failing is a good deed in and of itself.  It actually hurts everyone in the end.  End of story.  So that's the type of drama that goes on here at times ;) The more and more I am away from home, the more appreciative I become of my friends, some of you in particular.  I can't believe that half the people here are actually going to become doctors one day.  At least I'm doing fine :)    Now, here's a medical mnemonic for the day: "She Looks Too Pretty, Try To Catch Her!"  Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrium, Psiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capate, Hamate.  Those are the carpal bones, proximal to distal, lateral to medial.  And I'll be home in 43 days ok JL? :)   Ok, bye.
