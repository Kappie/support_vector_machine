Fred Rogers was a good man and he will be sorely missed. Some of my earliest memories are of watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.  I remember enjoying having a program where the theme wasn't just educational; after watching it you got the impression that Mr. Rogers genuinely cared about you and didn't think that your problems were just "kid's stuff". Fred, here's to you, my friend.
