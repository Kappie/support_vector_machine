But as we were driving from Cardiff to Cayucos, we stopped at a McDonalds somewhere south of Simi Valley on the 101. It was about 9:30 at night, and I was dressed in camouflage like the military. We walked in, ordered our meal, ate it, and were getting ready to leave when a guy from the Air Force walks in in his camo. He was in his 30’s and had dark skin. He started heading toward me (the restrooms were behind me) and took notice of my attire. “What’s goin’ on, Marine?” he said as he passed by, seeing the U.S. Marines patch on my shirt. Mom started cracking up and my heart started pounding, feeling stupid for acting like a little boy playing dress up, especially since I wasn’t a Marine yet. He walked out of the restroom and we got to talking, and he said that he had just been flown in that night from Iraq, where he was fighting the war. He had a large family, who he met at the McDonalds. He was very interested in why I picked the Marines as a future career, and he added that the Marines are “always fighting.” He said that he was once an Army Ranger, and he believed that everyone should stand up and serve their country. He really put down war protesters by saying “We went over there to pick the Iraqis up after they fell captive to Saddam. We wouldn’t risk our lives doing something that wasn’t as important as that.” We spent a lot of time talking and he gave me a tip: “If you are ever an officer in a battle and your men ask you if you’re scared, say ‘yes’, because if you say ‘no’, you are in danger, and you are lying.” Before he left he added, “Good luck, everyone should serve their country.”
