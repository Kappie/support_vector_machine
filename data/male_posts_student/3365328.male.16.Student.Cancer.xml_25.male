It now fails to leave the boot screen, or even display the swirly bouncy logo thing. So, after declaring it dead, me and my friend did the only sane thing uinder the circumstances.  So, after we'd pulled it apart completely, screw for screw, with the aid of a screwdriver, and casually strewn the complex-looking parts around the room, I decided it was time to buy another one. A bit of a waste of £10, but then again, I could always sell the GD-ROM drive for £5 like I saw someone do on Ebay. :P
