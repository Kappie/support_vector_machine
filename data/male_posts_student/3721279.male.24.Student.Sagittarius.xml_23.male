I commented, and he agreed that our little secluded track (and by secluded, I mean right next to a freaking middle school) is getting shorter each time we do it. Then it was back for some lifting, though I know I didn't push myself nearly as hard as I could have, or as hard as Robb was pushing himself. The jack knives continue to be mean to me, but I think they, as well, are getting easier. You just wait...one of these days, I'm going to unleash my inner greek god.  You know what else feels good?  Growing a pair and speaking your heart, even if it is way too late in the night to be doing any such thing. Even if things don't always work out the way you want them to, you've got to try. Because who knows, one day it might actually turn out the way you've envisioned it. It's good to grow, and good to fail sometimes. If you can smile in the end, and walk on to your next battle, eventually you may triumph one day.  Today might be the day I go shopping. I'm not sure, so don't hold me to it. The checking account is kind of shallow at the moment, but there is that nice shiny credit card sitting in my wallet, begging to be whored out for the singular purpose of enlarging my wardrobe. Perhaps, if I can still walk after I take my shower and shave my scruffifilous face, I will snatch up man friend Robb, and go accessorize. I should bring Brian too, for he is rather androgynous like me, and has a keen fashion sense sometimes. Alas, he is off selling his soul to Gamestop, as I will be doing in a few hours, because.............................................  Today is Madden Day. Oh, you didn't know?  You're not some kind of crazed sports fanatic? Well then, steer clear of the Park City mall after about 6 pm, because you could potentially be caught up in a whirlwind of testosterone. I have to report in at around that time, but all I have to do is greet the masses, and remind them all to reserve some other stupid sports game while they enjoy their brief stay in my store. Still, not having to run register, and only needing to worry about dancing around and entertaining people could quite possibly be the easiest money there is to earn, so I'm down, Yo. Oh, and I get to wear jeans, too!  So I'm just kind of um, sitting here now. I'm going to try and get out of my chair without tearing my abs in half. Lovers, get back to your loving. I'll join you another day.
