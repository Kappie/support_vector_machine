(wait, it gets worse!). Not only was it football, already described as a horrible sport, but it was on the exceptionally muddy school field, now less than half covered with grass. To top it off, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS F*****G FREEZING! Now, I'm not saying that games lessons are a bad idea, a lot of kids could do with the exercise, but do we have to do it outside when it is raining? Personally, I think it would be a much better idea if all games lessons took place inside during the winter and outside during the summer. It's torture to go outside when it's about 5 degrees and pissing down with rain. MOST OF US WERE IN SHORTS! And then you see the teacher standing at the edge of the football pitch with a huge coat on, really thivk trousers staring at us. I swear he's laughing at us... But I think it is very dangerous to to play sports on a wet field anyway, people could easily slip over, or failing that they could catch a cold from the freezing weather.  As I said, I don't think the games lesson itself is bad, exercise is good for you (supposedly), which brings me on to my next point, linked with Megatrobe's complaints about big companies. The number of overweight children in this country is drastically increasing, a result of modern fast food chains and easy pre-packed foods (crisps, burgers etc). These fast food restaurants are only interested in making a profit, no matter how much damage they have on the young people of society. Why can the government put taxes on fast food like they do on cigarettes and petrol, all are contributing to an over-worked health service. The ammount of fat and grease that is put into fast food is astronomical, far more than needed, topped off with far more salt that is needed. These unhealthy foods contribute to diseases such as diabetes, all of which could be avoided if fast-food restaurants and junk food were made more expensive. I for one have vowed never to eat McDonalds food again, it's disgusting, it's unhealty, and it's not needed. Apparently this generation of children are the first generation in however many years to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. My final summing up: Increase taxes on/ban junk food.
