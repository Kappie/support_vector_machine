Some asshole rammed our fence in their car. How they managed to be going at enough speed on our road is worrying enough. Also they must be blind and stupid.  And on a much lighter note the Flames lost 1-0 last night. So its 2-2, and could go either way.  Meh. I'm tempted to just go to sleep now and hope tomorrow is better. 'Tis just one of those days.
