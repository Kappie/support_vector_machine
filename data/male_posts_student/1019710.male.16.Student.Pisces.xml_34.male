Back to my life:  Me and Will both agree that if your invited to the Prom by someone you should be greatful and nice about it. Because if your not we're gonna break your knee cap(s) and slap you. Oh and don't worry if your not greatful you'll be spending most of your night at home anyway, that is if you can keep your date. I'm not going to Prom so this really doesn't pertain to me, but I still find it comial the way some people act.
