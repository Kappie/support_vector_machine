Dad said yesterday that we arent goin up there this summer.  we're gonna wait till Fall break.  so that should be fun.  i really dont wanna go back to school which we must do on July 29 i think.  it stinks.  hmmm.. it looks stormy outside.  it was pretty bad last night.  i loved lookin at the rain though.  it was cool cuz the wind would blow it and you could see like waves of rain move accross the road.  lol.  well i thought it was cool.  yeah well... lol.  i really have nothin interesting to say so i'm just gonna go.
