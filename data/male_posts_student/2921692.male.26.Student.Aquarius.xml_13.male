Now they're in Napels and let themselves burn by the sun. Happy people. By the way, Ciro is one of the owners of  urlLink the restaurant . Afterwards I ate with Francesco a tasty pasta with mushrooms (yellow boletuses) at  urlLink his restaurant .  Today the weather is as bad as it used to be this summer. Pouring rain... Later I will meet my brother. Perhaps we will take a few photos or hide in the darkroom. A prospos: I have a few digitalized pictures now. If I have a little spare time I will put them on this site. Next week...
