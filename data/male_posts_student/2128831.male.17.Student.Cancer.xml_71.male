End of that… Am I too sensitive? Oh, well. Who cares? One happy thing today.  RILEY ROCKS Massively!!!!!!  I say this from the bottom of my heart.  No sarcasm =D!  But, as for the rest of it well I pretty much failed two tests and my weekend plans are complete shit, so I am stuck in Necedah, WI for another lonely weekend…  When all I wanna do it be in Oshkosh…  I seriously want one of my plan to work out…  Nine days till the SATs and 16 to the ACTs, so weekend are shot down in the morning for the next three weeks.  Why can’t I drive?  Why can’t I like have a good group of friends, I mean they are good, but no real driving individuals…    Day Tenn. County Wants to Charge Homosexuals DAYTON, Tenn. (AP) - The county that was the site of the Scopes ``Monkey Trial'' over the teaching of evolution is asking lawmakers to amend state law so the county can charge homosexuals with crimes against nature. The Rhea County commissioners approved the request 8-0 Tuesday.  Commissioner J.C. Fugate, who introduced the measure, also asked the county attorney to find a way to enact an ordinance banning homosexuals from living in the county. ``We need to keep them out of here,'' Fugate said. The vote was denounced by Matt Nevels, president of the Chattanooga chapter of Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. ``That is the most farfetched idea put forth by any kind of public official,'' Nevels said. ``I'm outraged.'' Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Texas' sodomy laws as a violation of adults' privacy. Rhea County is one of the most conservative counties in Tennessee. It holds an annual festival commemorating the 1925 trial at which John T. Scopes was convicted of teaching evolution. The verdict was thrown out on a technicality. The trial became the subject of the play and movie ``Inherit the Wind.''  In 2002, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional the teaching of a Bible class in the public schools.  Fuck this rural reject asinine ignorance fucking cunt-bag county.  Screw them into the ground, I hope to God you mayor is gay, it would serve you justly!  STARRY STARRY NIGHT Allow me to geek it up a bit... or is that nerd out... There is big news in the astronomy community with the discovery of a new planetoid orbiting the Sun. Sedna, as it has been unofficially named is the latest object to be found in our solar system. Quaoar was found in 2002 in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.  Ok... Have I tossed out enough nonsensical words to make you wonder if I'm talking about real life or an episode of Star Trek?  I guess that is my whole point for being so excited about this, as I am. Right now is a truly exciting time. We have robots exploring Mars. There is talk of another Moon landing. We have discovered other objects that might one day be considered planets. If you enjoy anything about space and outer space sci-fi then I'm sure you are just wet with excitement. Yet, there is a down side to this... The two possible planetary candidates are currently stuck in planetoid status. Quaoar and Sedna while relatively close in size to Pluto are actually threatening Pluto's status as a full-fledged planet. Scientists go round and round on this all the time. Big deal... We have Inner Planets... (Mercury, Venus, Earth,  Mars) We have Outer Planets... (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,  Pluto) Why not have another grouping of planets? Group Pluto with Quaoar and Sedna and give them a fancy name that only the really anal retentive will ever remember to use.  I know I won't see it in my lifetime, but the idea that someday Earth might be sending a robot to explore planet Sedna is an amazing dream.  Too often, we lost sight of life’s simple pleasures.  Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown, but it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap that mother@#?!! upside their head!   -I hate Anthony’s catfish. It looks gross and creeps me out. It’s like a skeleton fish, a see through albino skeleton fish. -I’ve got money because the dollar bills have been collecting. Woohoo.  -I and Fabi will have fun downtown times. Can’t wait. -I need to actually pick up the phone and phone people so I can see them. But I’m dead tired today, so I will do it tomorrow. -I’m going to pick up drinking cognac/scotch/whisky on rocks. Because you know, I need the help in being more old lady like.  Will:  John, I love you  Will: But asexually, not emotional desires, yeah.  I am taken, but I do love you… John: What like a plant?  Will: Yes, exactly!  There glad that is clear!
