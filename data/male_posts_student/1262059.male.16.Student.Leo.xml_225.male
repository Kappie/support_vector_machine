It first started off when i found that i was the only one in the religion area to help set up. not exactly a nice start to things =P but that was ok, cause i went to the staff room and nabbed JR and Tim to help out ^^ the setting up and the displays were pretty much same as last year (with minor differences), except we had a TV showing a documentary thingie, and we had DDR on display. Hopefully, we'll get it to work next year =P   I took way more breaks this year than last year (when i carted sushi for like the entire night), so i got to go around the place many times. Saw lotsa people, and when the doors opened, saw more people. This year seemed to be less crowded (probably 'cause they didn't sell at door this time), and there were also ticket scalpers this year. Interesting idea.... too bad it's one that'll probably get them suspended =P   Now onto the actual pavilions. I'd hafta see ours (the japanese pavilion) was the best ^^ of course, i may be a bit biased, but still: we had the biggest pavilion, most displays, food that were much on demand (sushi, teriyaki chicken) and soup and tea to compliment. If DDR had been working, we'd win on interactivity too =P as it is, i'd hafta say the Chinese pavilion win in that category for their cool pick-up-marble-with-chopsticks-and-win game    Ok, now the performances. My memory is a bit off (damnit, i didn't get a programme =\), so i might alter some stuff later on if i change my mind.    Best music group performance:  Of these, there was the Germany pavilion, Italian pavilion and the group that did "O Canada". The award goes to "O Canada" for the best rendition of the anthem i have heard so for. Creative and sounds cool =P Germany would win the runner-up... theirs was pretty good. For those that didn't notice, it was the song they played this morning before the anthem... either that or it was yesterday morning.    Best singing performance:  There were a few... but France win hands-down. Danielle and Mark did so amazingly... it was really, really good. Oodles of talent =P   Best dance routine:  A lot were so similar i seriously considered sleeping through it... these were the "sluttish dancing" routines (quote by Tim =P). Seriously, after 1 minute... you'd be like "is it over yet??" I forgot which one i considered the best... oh well   Best skit:  There was really only Canada and our pavilion that did a skit thingie... and i'd have to say ours was better. iunno... to me the Canada one wasn't that funny except for the part where Francross roleplays as Don Cherry. For us, i have only two complaints: not rehearsed enough, and singing was mediocre. The play itself was very original idea, and really touching; von's acting skills are pretty good and the ending was really good too (even though DYT tells me that was the least-rehearsed part =P).    Best rehearsed:  Following up on the whole rehearsal thingie... i would like to see next year's japanese performance as well coordinated as the korean performance this year. The timing and coordination was almost flawless oo;; and fans are cool. I was like "wow"... the hiphop that followed it was pretty cool too   Most Amusing:  I'd have to say the Vietnamese one was the most amusing... the guys with the hoes (TOOLS USED FOR PLOWING) were funny... and it's not even a skit or anything like that =P i just found it... really amusing how they stepped and pretended to plow the field =P   Honourable Mentions:  The... Ireland?... pavilion did that Riverdance thingie again, and it's even better than last year (which was already pretty good). They swung people around and stuff this year! Imagined if one of the girls flew off ... also worth mentioning is one of the last ones... forget which... where they danced while those guys moved those poles beneath them and they have to avoid getting their legs hit by the poles ... and last but not least, the chinese pavilion with cool martial arts stuff and jen showing that she's better at it than all the other guys oo;;    Overall best pavilion:  I think the chinese pavilion would win that: even though they didn't have much (if anything) on display, they did really good on the stuff that counts: food and performance. Not to mention their cool marble game thingie.    I would really like to hear other people's feedback on int'l night ^^   ~Chro
