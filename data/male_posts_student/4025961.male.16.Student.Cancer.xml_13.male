About kids not listenning to adults, so adults passed the Battle Royale act. Sending a class of kids to an island, where they fight to the death, till one is left. They get a bag of junk, food, water, map, and a random weapon. Some kids get guns, knives, axes, cross bows, pot lid. Yeah, so the movie follows a class of kids and their antics. Some of the asian girls were hot in it. haha. Go-go from Kill Bill v.1 was in there too.  Also went to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. man, good movie. I dont want to give a detailed review. But there was a lot of comments on racism in the movie. And how racist everything is. Man, its got a dope message. It's also a pretty fuggin funny movie. Must see, any minority HAS to see it. Whitey's you can watch it too, get a good laugh outta it.  Word, postin, 3 wheel motion coastin.  Today's Message From Erwin: Harold and Kumar Go To In n Out ...west coast version
