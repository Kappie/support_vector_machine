Obligatory song lyric post.      "Father time, I'm running late  I'm winding down, I'm growing tired  Seconds drift into the night  The clock just ticks till my time expires       You were once my friend  Now I know I can't tie your hands  The days I saved I couldn't spend  They fell like sand through the hourglass  No time to lose, no time to choose       Time taking time, it's taken mine  Scenes of my life seem so unkind  Time chasing time creeps up behind  I can't run forever, and time waits for no one  Not even me       An enemy I can't defend  My final place a deadly end  Life's just a speck in space  Dreams of an eternal resting place       I can't get any younger  Time has brutal hunger"     I have no time anymore.  I lied.  I do have time, but no one else does when I do.  Wtf.... I know the world doesn't work around me... but still.  I'd like something to work out with people sometime in my life.....
