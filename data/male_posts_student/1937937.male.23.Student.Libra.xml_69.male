They say, "if you aren't moving forwards, you're moving backwards".  Well -- I ask them this -- how the hell do I go backwards?  I suppose smoking crack would be moving backwards -- but if I were doing it, wouldn't I still be growing?  The point is, don't ask so many stupid questions.  Okay.  Car broke down today, but that was cool because DMX gave me a jump.  I gave him two dollars -- one before my car even broke down, and one after he fixed it.  He wanted beer.  Not the real DMX.  Well, he wasn't a fake DMX, but he wasn't exactly  The DMX  either.  He wasn't wearing a shirt.  His tattoo was "DMX".  What does that  mean ?  Don't ask so many stupid questions.  My dog likes to eat Kleenex.  Especially after I've used it.  Seamus told me he wanted to travel the world today.  I said, "Seamus, you're 17.  Give it time."  In my heart, I said, "Go!  Run!  Explore the universe, my friend, before you are old and broken and dead."  None of that is true, except for what Seamus said.  Except his name isn't Seamus.
