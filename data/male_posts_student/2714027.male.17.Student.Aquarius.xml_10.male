Um, so far we've done the following.  1) Constructed the template document which dynamically creates the front page links and menus from mysql db entries (in a table a_menu)  2) Phil's mapped out a load of things he wants doing, and the order in which he wants them doing. Now it's just all about finding the time to do them.  Our deadline is 'officially' the end of this month for the front end, and then i can work on a new, wizzy admin section while Phil's on holiday.
