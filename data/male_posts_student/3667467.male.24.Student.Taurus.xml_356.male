Perhaps you know of my previous Yahoo! addictions, such as Launchcast Radio (reached "fanatic" in three days; temporarily banned for overuse), Geocities website space (I have two sites), and Yahoo! Photos (about 1200 photos uploaded within the first forty-eight hours). Now I play a game or two against whatever goof is online. Many times it's grandmothers that completely destroy me.  ADDENDUM:  After just playing, I must admit I totally rocked it. The score was like 300 to 170. I used up all my letters 3 times. THREE times, people. THREE.
