GUESS who, wrote phloem initially (presumably the correct answer) but CHANGED it! changed it! that's right. ME. oh man. oh PLUS, the rj bio dept has like little to NO grammar skills so the questions were stupidly phrased too. GLOOOOOp. that's me drowning in my sorrows. haha. ok that didn't even sound right. bio makes people incoherent. boohoo. hahahaha. good luck for math. and.. any other papers. haha. today has just been traumatising.
