So...we also talked about, lesbians, transexuals, coconuts, dogs humping, cats having sex, pedophiles (umm...wrong), Johnny Depp, POTC set pieces, web comics....yeah, we are some truly disturbed individuals, eh?  I'm terminally addicted to UT2004. I can't stop playing it...it beckons me to touch it, stroke it, frag 20 guys at the same time with an Ion cannon...mmm....yes.  Practiced my guitar a bit, yes. No, I still suck.  I FINALLY GOT FIGHT CLUB BACK! It's been 2 weeks but Adam finally returned it! I'm a happy clam.  That's about all the news bout me that I've got. So, see you all later. Stay cool.  ---Ben B., prince of pr0n and PWNage. Mood: Happy Listening to: Velvet Underground - Loaded Thought: "Pimpin fruitcakes on rollerskates!"
