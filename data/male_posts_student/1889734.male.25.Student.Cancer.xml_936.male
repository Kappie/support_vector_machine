BUT, if you follow Todd's copyright/piracy/free info rave a few months back, this is interesting.    Basically, a company in Cali, is claiming it owns the rights to UNIX.  And that there are tons of outstanding LINUX operating systems contain to some degree small lines of proprietary UNIX code.  Therefore, this company owns that and you have to pay a royalty.  This is HUGE.  And the legal battle is startling.  Please read and digest, this could shake the copyright world.
