She jolted up, and groaned when she saw her sister’s mischievously smiling face. Just then Matt and Muthu entered the room. Both of them had already changed into their robes and seemed very surprised that Cheryl had just awoken.  	 “Well, hurry up, the carriages are leaving in an hour, and there’s breakfast downstairs...” Matt said impatiently.  	 Cheryl stared, bleary-eyed, at him, before finally getting to her feet. As she walked into the adjoining bathroom and shut the door, she distinctly heard Matt ask, “Is she  always  like this?”  					----------  Forty-five minutes later they were all assembled in the pub below. The Hogwarts students were looking very odd indeed, with their robes and various trunks in stark contrast to their families, who were still in Muggle attire. They were chivvied out by Bill, the innkeeper, who kept on shouting “You’re late! You’re late!” Cheryl thought it was more likely that they were blocking the entrance of the inn and that Bill wanted them out. 	 They made their way out of the inn and walked briskly down the alley. At the end of the alley they turned right, into a lane which led to a large open space – it was about the size of a town square. The space was not as empty, though. There were nearly thirty black horseless carriages there. Hogwarts students were milling around, making it seem as if the space was some shimmering deep-blue sea. After saying their goodbyes to their families (Cheryl was more than happy to leave her sister behind), Cheryl, Muthu and Matt made their way onto one of the carriages. They were soon joined by their fellow Griffindoor fifth-years Minyu, Hu Ping, Barnabas, Yi Fan and Eunice. The carriages had had Engorgement Charms placed on them – though they looked small from the outside, the eight of them could fit inside comfortably. Their trunks went into a separate wagon attached to the carriage.  	 A few minutes later their carriage began to move. “Hold on tight!” Minyu shouted, as the carriages suddenly began to lift off the ground of their own accord – or perhaps there were invisible horses pulling the carriages. Soon they were cruising in the sky, passing so close to those fluffy cumulus clouds it felt as if they could touch them. Cheryl, having taken the seat nearest to the window, was enjoying the view of the Central Business District, slowly moving on to tidy HDB estates, which slowly became more sparse as they travelled westward.  	 “Wonder what’d happen if a Muggle saw these carriages...” Yi Fan mused.  	 Matt sighed. “Muggles  can’t  see these carriages – when the carriages take off, an Invisibility Charm is activated and they all become invisible.” 	 “Cool!” Yi Fan replied, his eyes round with amazement. His shoulders drooped slightly as he said quietly, “I wish I could do magic like that...”  	 No one said anything. They all knew that Yi Fan had barely scraped through fourth year with his poor grades.  	 They all kept quiet for a while, not knowing what to say. The awkwardness was finally broken when Hu Ping asked, “Who d’you think will take the vacant teaching posts?” 	 “My dad reckons they’ll be people from the Ministry. I mean, now that You-Know-Who’s back, the Ministry’s worrying that he can somehow spread his influence here. So they’ll be “implanting” Ministry officials as teachers in order to see that all goes well at school.” Barnabas said darkly. 	 “I say, that’s nonsense,” Eunice retorted. “About You-Know-Who coming here, I mean. In the first place, there’re so few wizards here that he’ll find it hard to find people to bewitch and whatnot. And why would he care about small fry like Singapore anyway?”  	 “Well, hey, he tried to kill Harry Potter, who was a baby...” Cheryl piped up. “And did I tell you how handsome Harry is now…”  	 The rest rolled their eyes. Cheryl continued dreaming, a faraway look in her eyes. 	 “We’re slowing down,” Muthu said, peering out.  	 The carriage did indeed seem to be slowing down – it soon descended and landed on a grass clearing right in front of the castle. All around them carriages were landing. It was a queer sight – this whole posse of black carriages, flying by themselves.  	 “We’re just in time for the feast,” Barnabas said. 	 Cheryl nodded fervently. Having rushed that morning, she had had no time to take breakfast. Quickly, together with her friends, she joined the stream of students entering the castle.
