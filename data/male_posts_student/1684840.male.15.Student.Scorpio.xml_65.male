How the hell I fell asleep is a mystery, I must have just collapsed or something lol!  Even though I kept waking up in the night because of my body clock being screwed, I still didn't notice the light was on or the fact I was fully dressed :s  I feel properly awake now, but I'm still a bit groggy.  I'll go and get breakfast in a min.  It's sad.  I woke up and I thought 'I wonder what we're doin today' and then when I opened my eyes I moaned.  Sleep can really confuse you, you know.  I had thought we were still in America, proberbly because it seams so dreamy here.  Maybe it won't when I go out in the freezing cold to go to school eh, lol.  I still really wanna be back in America though, I suppose I'm going to have to live with it until we go back :(
