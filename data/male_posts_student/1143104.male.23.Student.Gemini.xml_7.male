When you lean in for the kiss, chances are, the girl will pull away if your breath smells like her toilet. If you just ate some nice Mexican food, or woke up and ate a bowl full of crap, please take a few moments out of your life and brush your teeth. Preferably after your done, use an antibacterial mouthwash and rinse your mouth out. That should guarantee (to 99.7% according to Listerine) the cleanliness of your mouth. :-) This will also guarantee that the woman you are leaning in to kiss won't turn and run...at least not from your breath!
