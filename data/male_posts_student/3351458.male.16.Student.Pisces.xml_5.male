Something tells me I need to take anti-depressent medications soon to avoid a repeat (or to prevent) of many stupid things I've done, like the way I almost massacred my computer after some Haitian gangster pulled the plug on me in a game. Or the way I don't feel the need to say anything serious to anyone anymore. Or the way I'm now sleeping extremely early at night which I would've considered absolutely ludicrous only two or three weeks ago. I need to find out what's causing all this. Anyone out there who knows a good shrink, do recommend him/her to me...... Certain friends have been great, though. The best of all is a very close friend of mine. I've known him since Std. 1, we've fought each other, we've triumphed over and failed a lot of things together and we've done a lot of crazy stuff together. Good thing is, we can get along fine even though we have our own set of friends, own set of likes and dislikes and he supports Liverpool (I think football loyalty is worthy of mention here. Haha). I need some diversions. Anything other than the only thing I'm doing now is good. The last time I even graced our school field with my presence (hahahaha!) was four months ago. I haven't played football that long! Good god! Looks like I'm giving Rio Ferdinand a run for his money. I had a VERY strong urge of just whacking a very, very tempting football that was lying in my Principal's office this morning.... Also, as in the previous post, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank a few more people. > 3 Doors Down for Away From The Sun, which is keeping me from going insane as I write this... > David Sneddon for his, uh, inspirational songs (??!?!) > And finally to U2 for rocking......
