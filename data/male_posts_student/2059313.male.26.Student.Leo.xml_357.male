       
      So, I was diagnosed with an eye infection and given some antibiotic drops to put in my eye four times a day for the next week.  What a pain in the butt.  This was also the day I decided to get my eye glass prescription updated.  I went down to eye glass world...  BUY ONE GET ONE FREE!!!     Awesome!    The only thing is that I've never bought new frames without having someone there to help me and look and tell me if they looked good/bad on me or not.  Well, I didn't have that this time.  I was left to the mercy of one of the sales associates, I tried on about 15 different pairs of frames, but I couldn't really tell how I looked in them because I didn't have contacts in, and the frames just had clear glass in them.  I was totally at his mercy.  He helped me pick out two sets of frames, and I decided to make one of them a pair of sunglasses.  They'd be ready for pickup the next day. (fortunately and unfortunately - I would be in Nashville the next two days).  As the time to pick up my glasses drew nearer, I became very nervous about how they would actually look on me.  One friend said I was being silly.  Which I probably sounded like... but it was a lot of money gone down the drain if I didn't like them... and since I hadn't ACTUALLY seen what they looked like on me, it was a big worry.    When I got back in town, I went and picked up my glasses.  I put the sunglass pair on first... BAM! I could see amazingly well... I looked in the small mirror on the counter and was amazed at how great the frames looked on me!  I set that pair down and went for the regular ones, BAM! once again I could see perfectly!  I looked in the mirror and thought WOW!  I look AWESOME!  Now, anyone that knows me, knows that I'm pretty modest when it comes to my looks, and my own self image isn't always the best either, so when I say that I look TOO sexy in these glasses, you'd know what a big deal that is.  With these glasses added to my cool hair cut (thanks again, Stephanie), I'm one step closer to being a babe magnet.    I've always been told that I'd make a great boyfriend and that I have an awesome personality, I just need to hook someone with the "look factor" so they have the chance to see the charming, chivilrous, loyal, I'd do anything for you, senstive, loving, with a hard-candy shell - me.  That and I need advertising!  Help guys!
