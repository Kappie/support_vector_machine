Well at least the wedding was, that must be why they didn't film live after marriage. But who knows, maybe love that last do exist. Anyway, picked up a few lines from the show. HEheee.... Simple words, beautiful language. How I wish I can just come out with all those gorgeous phrase. Arhh, wedding sure is beautiful.   OK, now everyone in this house is sleeping. What should I do? Lao da bought this vcd titled "My Girl", its a Thai movie telling a story of a very young first love. Cute huh? At only age 10. At age 10, food is what matters to me most. HEhee... Its such a shame I don't have any primary school pictures. I was such a pig then, my sisters use to call me an alien cause I was so chubby, my eyes looked a lot like a line behind those  HUge ,  s q u a r e i s h ,  O ~ biang  looking spectacles. I bet you guys won't believe its me at all. Back then I was called ugly. Now, I'm not handsome, just any other normal looking Chinese guy u might find on the street. But still I like my face then, cause it was fair and flawless. For now, I have to look into the mirror seeing the face of moon with craters so big, you can even see it with your naked eyes.  Hhmmm....... getting way outta point there. With narrowing eye sight, I guess I will not be watching that vcd now. =Ã¾
