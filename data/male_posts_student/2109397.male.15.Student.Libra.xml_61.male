We kicked ass, 2-0. I had no goals against and I played pretty good at sweeper too. I kicked the shit out of the ball like 20 times and it was fun. I intimidated the fuck outta this kid and he missed his pk. BAM.   Oh yea there was something homosexual else. Durin the game someone from their team cleared the ball and it went rilly far and into these woods/brush shit fuck. The ball was Warrens and those mo fucks dint even help us look for it. Actually it was just me n Warren which shows how stoopidly fuck gay our team is, but we were kickin the piss out of those tree/bush things.
