Why don't I realize this? I hate politics, wish it would die. But still, everything is political eventually. You can't escape; it's like air or stupid people, always there, always around you. We've talked about situations before: pre-emptive strikes, Bush's knowledge or lack thereof.   (here's where I start talking about my views. If I insult you, stop reading my blog. If I don't...meh.)  But the shit hit the fan when we spoke of speech rights. Look, I'm a libertarian. Freedom of everything,   especially   freedom of speech. I like freedom in a box, I like freedom with a fox. I even like freedom in a can. I do, I do, Sam I Am. I used to believe that freedom of speech should be detracted for military reasons (how do you keep up moral when some fucker is running around saying you should dodge the draft?), but my misguided leader Bush killed that for me. The War on Terror will never end. There will always be people who dislike the US and therefore there will always be extremists to hate all the more. So, in order to keep speech from being permanently short-changed, I've got to believe even war shouldn't keep us from talking. But Emily disagrees or seems to. It started as a discussion about  whether  speech is limited and ended as a tussle over  if  speech should be limited. Emily made the good point that speech is limited in schools, I say, screw that, I'll wear a 2-foot crucifix and ceremonial robe to school if I freekin' want! Come on, government, try to stop me and my blatant religousity. I hate France because of this: they restrict religion in the classroom. The school of America should be a place of free learning, not stale textbooks and equally stale discussions! I'll dare any religious man of another faith to fight me over God. Anyone! And once again, no school bureacracy has the right to restrict my constitutional 1st amendment rights. Emily said that certain speech should be restricted because it can be dangerous. Example: Hitler's anti-Semitic talks led to the deaths of millions. I say, it was not only his antisemitism but his restriction of pro-semitism that led to deaths. Literally hundreds of Christian pastors were killed or defrocked by the German government for their attempts to promote such views. I say, let the dangerous speak but also let the right and peaceful speak. If Hitler wants to hate the Jews, fine, but let my homies and me like them. It is only when some view is taken out of running that fists fly and necks are put agaisnt the wall. It's because they don't want us talking, not because they can talk.  Poonam says I should be more social. Fat chance. I don't know why I'm not social, but I'm not and almost assuredly never will be. I was born to be alone (or at least alone with God) and plan to follow this path until divine providence shows a better one.  I'm not so sure about my relationship with Emily now. It was going good, but political disparaties and stupid acts (totally on my part, of course) are dragging us down. She is no longer the quiet nameless girl I know from Debate. She has a name, a persona, and damn well will defend it. Can I tolerate these gaping divides in our ways? Not really. Only a repressive communist regime "accepts" differences. I refuse to simply give up my beliefs and numbing nod along to the music. I will respect her as a person, even as a friend and girlfriend, but heaven help me if I start "accepting" differences. One of the greatest reasons I believe in free speech, is that only through discourse can differences be defined and realized. Only by battling out my thoughts can I realize whether I am wrong or right. Therefore, I shall continue my ways, even if they annoy and pester. But, as always, I must choose my battles. And may they never be political.  I went to the dreadlock place today. It was a quick in-and-out as society frightens me and there is little more social than a hair salon. I learned that dreads are expensive. It's  $40 an hour for 4-5 hours. I may want to let my hair grow a little longer, so that they droop instead of sticking out. As stated I wait until after pictures for dreads. But I don't know if I'll wait one day or until after Debate. I know dreads will kill any political capital with conservative judges, and can only hurt my speaks. I know that people will view me differently and for the worse. But that never has frightened me and won't now (see. antisocial.). This will require further thought. I'm just happy to know that dreads can be made out of my incredibly Caucasian, straight, stringy hair.
