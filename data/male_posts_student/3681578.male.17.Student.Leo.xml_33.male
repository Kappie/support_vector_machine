Anna Santos is our new block representative and she just started what I will refer to as her "reign" kanina in Bombita when she was bitching THE MA21 TRIO about not coming early because she reserved daw the whole line for the block pero other people already seated themselves in that row because we were not yet there or something like that...I do hope Anna reads this...  2. Our Filipino Project just got the highest marks in the class, together with Aira's Group...A B+ plus the honor of being recognized by Salazar for our craft and for David, a D class standing in Filipino...Still, an A in Filipino is still out of reach lest I have an A paper on Bombita which I am targeting to do this weekend so as to let some others read it so I can improve it...  3. I have not yet read three stories of the four that I have to read for my Lit paper...actually, we are only supposed to choose two from the four but if I want to get an A paper here as well, I have to read all stories and choose the two which I found were the best...I have not yet decided what option to take (Sir Mark gave us two options...one, choose the prominent element of fiction in both stories and explain how integral it is to the development of the story...or two, what is the similar thread of the stories and explain)...plus he said that we have to cite textual evidence...  4. I just had a conversation with Patrick E kanina about Physics stuff and I found out that us, Ma 21 peeps get to take Ma 22 plus another 3-unit core subject next sem...although I was like Yipee! I thought of the drawbacks especially getting a History subject in a semester when I am studying Filipino, English, Literature, Ballroom Dancing, Calculus and Calculus-based Physics...  5. I am trying to convince most of block V to take ballroom dancing next semester and so far, only Val and I have the initiative to do so...well, as Anna says...it all depends on the schedule...  So there...Time to do work...   --If f'(x)=g'(x)...--
