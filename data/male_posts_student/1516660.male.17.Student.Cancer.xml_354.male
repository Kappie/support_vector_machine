Okay. After that, waking up, eating breakfast, coming online, er..we went to lunch? Then we picked up PoPo and went to the funeral lor.  Yeah. It was quite boring, actually. We folded the incense all afternoon. The gold ingot. The tube-thingy. HaHa. I had fun. I discovered that our family is closest with FeiChui's family. Heh Heh. Oh well.  Edwin and Father went home to bath at 4+, leaving me and Mother there. Then, at 5.55, we went out to eat lor. I ate fish noodles. Yeah. When we came back, we found out that they brought food for us. We didn't tell them we are going out to eat. Sigh.   Yeah. After, I folded some more ingots till Father and Edwin came back. Then we went to burn some incense for MaMa. We were soon joined by Cousin SuFen and SuZheng. Wah...All of us burned a lot of stuff, and even the adults have to tell us to stop burning. Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, in goes the incense. The fire was big.   Yeah. After that was terrible boredom. Father's friends came, then Mother's friends. I was left at the table with BakLiong (Felicia's mother) and Edwin. I started to read my HZGG. Yeah.   Soon, BL's friend came. I was reading XiaoYanZi's really funny line (she was pondering about zi san ma huai) and started laughing out loud. Heh.  At 10 something, we left by taxi. We were all so tired to take the bus back. Yeah. We reached home at 11 something, bathed, and I went to sleep.   That's all blog. See ya next time. TaTa!
