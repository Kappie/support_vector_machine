Now, the mere mention of religion in a public school is taboo. 10 years ago, a person could smoke in the food court of a mall. While I don't agree with some of these changes, they are a perfect example that society is changing, and it is changing quickly.  10 years ago, talk of a casino was rejected by this community. 10 years is a long time, and much has changed here. This town does need more "razzle dazzle". If you drive down Lakeshore drive on any summer night, you will find the bars packed to the rafters with young people from accross the country, out just to have a good time. On long weekends, and perhaps even a regular Saturday night, I think it would be safe to say that many of these bars and lounges are filled to capacity. The demant in definatley there.  Yes, Sylvan Lake is a "family oriented town", and we do hold many events geared towards families. A casino would not change this in any way, it would just add a greater diversity to the activities this town offers. It's not like the casino would set up a dozen VLTs at the Polar Dip or have a Blackjack table set up outdoors for 1913 days. It would stay confined within it's walls, only accessible to those of age. To the argument that casino's harm people with gambling problems, I won't completely disagree. So, should a casino go ahead in this town, why not pass a bylaw, that would read something to the effect that "10 percent of all funds generated by a commercial establishment as a result of games of skill or chance be placed into a public fund". Use this public fund to sponsor a gambling and substance abuse awareness and recovery program.  The idea of a casino in Sylvan Lake needs more research and public debate, no doubt, but don't shoot the idea down before it's had a chance to get off the ground.
