All in all I liked it quite a bit, only problem was that we were sitting too close to the screen so it was difficult to follow the fast paced scenes. One thing really nice was that during the traversal of Cape Horn there was a cold wind breezing so it upped the atmosphere quite a bit, a sort of special effect :) Good thing too was that the story was more emphasized than the effects. To anyone that might pass through Bologna on a hot summer day... Following the Ugo Bassi street, once passed the Ugo Bassi statue, turn to the left and then to the right. In that street is a great ice cream store we call Gianni, it's worth the visit, trust me.
