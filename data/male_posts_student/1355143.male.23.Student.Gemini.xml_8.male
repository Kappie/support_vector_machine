Today I decided to go out with a few friends, I didnt plan on getting to drunk coz Im going out tomorrow night big time. Well so we went to the alcahol store and I bought Thule for tomorrow night and Corona for tonight, you know not to much alcahol and anyway you piss all the beer in just few moments.  Then after going to play football (inside nota bene), me and a friend of mine went to a schoolmate of ours and the forth guy, also a schoolmate, joined us a little later.  The plan was simple, whatch the Iceland Idol, behind the senes, then double American Idol, in the meanwhile get drunk and then go down town for further drinking and exploring Icelandic girls slutness.  Well first af all after two beer I decided on opening my bottle with a lemon in the same hand as I had the bottle, long story short I just manage to spill all the beer my jeans and my friends to and just well enough that it looks like we had both wet ourselfs.   After the Idol some vampire movie starring Aliyaa (I cant imagine how you write her name), came up and we started talking about something, when my phone starts ringing and it says that its my boss. I couldnt imagine why he was calling me at 10 minutes passed midnight at Fridaynight but I answered and he said anoyingly "arent you comin?". Well I just said yes and hang up, but I didnt have clue that I had to work, for all I knew I didnt have to show up until 4 in the afternoon on Sunday.  (one thing worthy of mentioning is that I work as kind of a segurity in Icelands biggest bank, I just sit for eight hours with another guy and walk around the house twice)  Well so I thought ok my breath smell like beer and most of all I smell like beer. So I loaned myself a shirt (I also managed to wet my shirt) did put far too much perfume right on my face and stole a gum pack. On the way I out called a taxi and asked it to go to the Bank. One thing I suddently missed from Barcelona are the taxi prices coz it costed something like eight Euros and I was in the taxi for something like 3 minutes.  I was lucky that my boss had already left and I dont think the other guy knows how beer smell like (honestly!). I have had alot of sleep to get this out of my sistem. I feeling rather frisky but almost like the hangover is coming soon!!!  Well just wanted share this with you, have I nice weekend, Úlli  Added later: Just one sad thing that I know that everyone is thinking about, well Icelands Handball team isnt doing so well coz they have lost both their matches and have big risk of falling out of the competition. I blame mostly bad referees and that the trainer doesnt have guts. For example we´ve got one of worlds best players and also one of worlds most promising player (that one plays for Barcelona). And if the best one is playing badly the coach doesnt take him of just plays him till the defence of the other team has beaten the crap out of him.    Well doesnt matter, Úlli
