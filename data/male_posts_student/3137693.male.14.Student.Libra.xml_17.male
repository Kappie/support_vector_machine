Its a small town in southern utah, it holds tons of some of my favorite childhood memories.. i remember riding horses with my grandad it was great. And more recently, i remember sitting on the beach of a small lake they have, teaching canoeing at a boyscout camp, this is one of my favorite things to do, i love working with the scouts. I remember when one of my friends at the camp came running down to the waterfront to tell EVERYONE he just got his mission call, it was probably one of the most exciting things that happend that summer. I can also remember the camp director warning the staff about bears, and right after he finished talking about how dangerous they are, we heard a big loud bear roar in the background, good times. The reason i've been thinking about this place so much is because school is ending soon, and i cant stand my new school, plus there is no place i would rather be than in blanding, its my ultimate #1 place i would ever want to be. Theres not lots of malls. Theres not lots of people. But... thats Blanding, i love every minute of it.
