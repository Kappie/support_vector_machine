" let me get a second just to reinvent myself."  these past few days have been nothing short of catastrophic for me. lets see i've:  damn near lost my relationship got into a bitch fight with my mom am right now currently suffering a feeling of which i cant even name damn near lost my relationship  yea i know, to you, my adrious reader, that really doesnt seem like a lot but thats only my way of putting eight smiles on it and making alot of shit all compiled into a few catergories.  well my usual way of dealing with these things was to just leave the house and just escape from it all. but coming back here being in this damn place i am more than reminded of that morid evening. i am reminded about why i'm a bad person, i'm reminded about how most of my friends are gunning for what i have. i reminded of no matter what i do, what i say, or what actions i take, this is just a losing battle. no, not with the peron im involved with, no, we're fine. cept for the fact that i get increasingly madder and madder when he keeps trying to hang out with one of the people whom i thought was my friend, who openly admitted that they would, in fact make moves on my spouse. as a matter of fact, let me get on that.  im dealing with a person here who has stated over and over again in the past that they would in fact do "things" ( lets keep this PG) with my spouse if given the chance. of course my spuse doesnt make the situation any better because they keep trying over nd over and over again to be involved with this person.  they justify it with saying, " only when your not around." of course i cant say anything to that. but, i just find it funny that its only when i'm not around that shit like this just seems to come up. also find it funny that over that last few weeks when my spouse wasnt around, when i asked you if i could come over you had one excuse after another, every fucking day. i hate that fact that my spouse tells me over and over again about how they dont like him, but they will jump on the chance to be around him at any giving moment. constantly waving movie offers and chance encounters in my face. just because i show no emotion doesnt mean it doesnt bother me. what i really do find funny, and again its only one of those things that happens when i am not around is that fact that, YOU just happen to invite my spouse over, claiming mommy wasnt going to be home, claiming that she worked evenings now. i find it funny that you told me she worked mornings and she's home during the day   thats why you couldnt have people over. and now, when my spouse is back in town she just so happened to have a schedule change.  i guess life is just funny.   ill end this with this note here... i've played around with this in the past, but i never meant it, but here, for the first time for all your viewing pleasure... i do.  Michael Tremain Brewer and Terrell Kenneth Lacey... I wish DEATH upon. I SWEAR TO GOD I HOPE YOU DIE!!!!
