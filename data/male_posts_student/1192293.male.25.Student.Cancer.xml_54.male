Last night on The Daily Show on Comedy Central Janeane Garofalo said something along the lines of 'at this point, a vote for [George W.] Bush is a character flaw'.  I couldn't agree more.  The worse the news gets coming out of Iraq, the less George Bush takes responsibility for it.  So we bumped Saddam out of Iraq and took over.  What does that really mean to anyone?  Apparently it means that those torture and rape chambers have to be run by  somebody , and it looks like that means us.  The atrocities get more disgusting and more immense with every day, and the Bush administration (or should I say the Ministry of Truth) somehow had nothing to do with any of it.  With the release of the pictures of the sexual assault on the Iraqi soldiers and now news that the American prison guards have killed 25 unarmed prisoners, some beaten to death with rocks, we have lost any hope of ever winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.  We should apologize and leave immediately.  Before this shit happened, there was at least some hope that we might be able to work together with the Iraqi people to build a new Iraqi government.  Now, that will never happen.  The only thing we can be sure of is continued and ever-escalating violence against our soldiers.  Who blames the Iraqis?  Not me.  Admit it.  If there were pictures and news stories about American soldiers being raped with flashlights and broomhandles, having electrodes attached to their penises, being paraded around naked and beaten to death, we would  lay waste  to the offending country.  No one would be safe from our wrath.  Even though it was proven that Saddam had no link with Al-Queda before we invaded, you can bet that Al-Queda operates in friendly country there now.  The  only  reasonable thing left to do at this point is to withdraw and hand everything over to the U.N.  If we do not, we will be trapped in a never-ending cycle of vengeance and violence.  Iraq will become an even bigger hellhole than Israel.  Our grand-children will die there.  Bottom line; we never had a reason to be there in the first place, and after this, staying there will be worse.  George W. Bush, you have destroyed the credibility of my country, killed my countrymen, and perpetrated the worst foreign policy failure this country has seen in almost 30 years.  Given time, and continued ineptitude on your part, it may become the worst failure ever.  Congratulations, asshole.    SOMEONE IMPEACH THIS FUCK!    Read George Orwell's 1984  urlLink here .

John McCain, an Arizona Republican and committee member who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, joined many lawmakers in complaining that Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials failed to inform Congress of the situation. Rumsfeld refused to use the word "torture." "I'm not a lawyer," he said. "My impression is that what has been charged thus far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture ... And therefore I'm not going to address the 'torture' word."  Rumsfeld, you're not a lawyer, no.  You're a fuck.  There are some things even lawyers wouldn't do.
