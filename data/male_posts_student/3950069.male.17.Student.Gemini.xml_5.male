Another week has passed, time really flies, doesn't it? It has been a traumatising week for me, and certain things that have gone through my head, just leave me torn inside. Bad things come in threes, really. It felt as if it was never-ending. I lost my wallet yesterday, I was so depressed. Me, Xing, Imm, Amy and Mei ling left school for Causeway point to have our lunch, since we had a 3 hour break, but who'd realise that when I reached our destination, I didn't have my wallet in my pocket. Only someone...would probably know how much significance my wallet had to me. It wasn't just a wallet. I made a police report, made a call to the Taxi Headquarters, i'm still clinging on to some hope, that I would get it back...sigh. Why did something like that have to happen when everything was just going wrong for me? Well, I guess things just happen. I don't wanna let my parents know about it yet, because I feel ashamed, of losing my things. I've always misplaced my things, lost my ez-link cards, I feel so...sick.     'Phat nite'   was alright, there was fun and laughter, but when it all ended, the same sinking feeling came right back. I'm gonna face up to my problems though, I don't wanna feel so dead, anymore. That was all yesterday.    Today was alright, went for photography in the morning. Its really interesting and I do believe i'll learn a lot, the guy guiding us cracked me up for being so animated and straight-forward about his views. That's all I had today, I just needed rest when i got back home because i've been really drained the past couple of days. I'm hoping things get better.     We could hold hands, walk down this path we've chosen and be happy, tell me, is it true?
