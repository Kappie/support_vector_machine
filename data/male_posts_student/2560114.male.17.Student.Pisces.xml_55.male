I think my mom and my dad should get blogs and jus say shit like i do. Seriously though, my mom has some major issues concernin my dad, my dad has done some stupid shit in the past, like cheatin on my mom and gettin drunk all the time, and now my mom is jus doin the same thing...except for the cheatin part. I love my mom to death, shes always been with us through everything, and me and my sis r jus stuck in the middle between all of this, all of the bitchin and arguein we have endured over the years. Im always the peace keeper, i try not to let this shit happen, right now i feel like the most mature person in this house, i feel like im the guardian for all of these kids i have to deal with one of them cryin, one of them taunting another kid, another kid ran away...BLAH! I need to getaway from this shit, i need to b alone...   urlLink Stay Together For The Kids...
