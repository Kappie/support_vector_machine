For instance, everyone should know about  urlLink "Rock, Paper, Saddam"   Also, I would encourage you to all go see Fahrenheit 911.  It's a good movie. I went to a party last night.  The most interesting thing was probably the attempt to cut a watermelon with a bread knife. We ended up cutting a weird, jagged elipse around the melon, and then scooping out the insides with an ice-cream scoop and eating it with spoons. Also, if you haven't seen  urlLink tailsteak.tk  before, the Tournament of Things is just starting. To conclude, for Evelyn, I'm starting a Canadian COuntdown: 3 1/4 Days!  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.
