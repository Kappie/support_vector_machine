Ordered 2 excellently deliscious pizzas from slice of italy.!:) But somehow the day seems to be very gloomy.There seems to be a strange pang...of anxiety(?)?  Somehow , now as the days go counting by,the pressure is slowly creeping over.CBSE,SAT(to give or not to give!!),DCE,IIT(yeah sure!!!). Dunno how it'll end...but i do know that i have to work....and work  work.  Got reminded of an old fello-student today....(u know whom)!!!  but am a little worried...haven't heard from ms for a lot of time.Wonder whats up...?  Guess i must return to "Numerical Problems In PHYSICS"....(quite unintriguing)!  I mean,i don't think we should be taught anything else except things which NEED to be pondered upon...like SPECIAL relativity.But this year's physics isn't bad....have to start magnetism by tomorrow.  And also there's talk of going over to maasi's on saturday to pick up Ilaksh.  ALSO have to watch a movie with saurabh this weekend(coz this weekend is possibly the only one i can....guessed why??...c'mon...english M.T.!!!)  Chalo,physics numericals now....  Chao/Sayonara/Gutten nacht...!
