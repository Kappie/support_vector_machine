It was a very moving experience for me, from the weekly cell meetings to the energizing Youth On Fire worship services up until the big event: the Campus Harvest in Baguio. This was a gathering of thousands of students, high school and college alike, from around Asia. I got to be part of the worship team alongside Joaquin and other friends whom I’ve met through the months that have passed. I was honored to be part of such a gargantuan religious gathering. Thousands of new believers came to Christ because of that event. Even old believers like me have become even closer to God because of this experience. I’m not saying I’m the perfect Christian now. I still have a long way to go. But I have to say that I’ve become quite a different person since my first Starbucks meeting months ago. I’ve learned to become more patient and lenient with other people. I’ve also become quite adventurous, outgoing and fun loving. Most of all, I’ve become a God-fearing person. Recently, I’ve begun to share my testimony with my classmates in hopes that they would also get closer to God. Quite a few responded positively. A little more work and I’m hoping to start my own cell group in a few months time. I have never imagined, in my wildest dreams, that I could ever become more than what I was a few months ago. Now, I look back on how I have done over that span of time and say that I am very proud of myself. I’m finally starting to be the true Christian I always wanted to be. And it all started one humid Saturday morning at Starbucks.  finally! i finished my ateneo essay...hehe....comments pls guys...thanks....khit nambabastos pa okay lang...anyways, i just got my lasalle main and benilde application kit today...astig...hehe...animo lasalle! i rili wish i would pass...i heard the exam was really hard so im studyin extra hard as well...i talked to mika last night...at least she didnt diss me na...tinulugan nalng ako...hehe...pro its alright...i missed her too much to get angry at her...hehe...anyways, thats all guys...ingatz...chill...
