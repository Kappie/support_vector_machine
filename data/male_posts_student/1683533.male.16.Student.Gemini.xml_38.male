No!...god doesnt it seem sorta low to think that as soon as the power goes out we are supposed to turn into homicidal cannibals... "Oh that man is helping at traffic lights that arent working...I'm so glad he is doing that instead of bashing my head with a brick." and looting is actually a good sign of optimism...the person is basically saying, "the power's out but I am absolutly sure the power will come back, then I will be happy I have this new microwave oven..."  But seriously folks...the blackout didnt bring Detroit into happy little friendly town where everybody gets along...the  FUCKING LIGHTS WENT OUT!  that's it!...sure, some people were helpin give water to people and such, but for every person that would do that there would be another person passed out drunk in alleyway in Detroit cause that's how Detroit is...and always will be...
