I saw a poster at  Carl's Jr . for the low carb breakfast bowl that had scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and cheese in it. That sucker has to have some absurd amount of saturated fat, which is worse for you than carbohyrdrates. Other fast food places have other stupid low carb things too.     I think that low carb is lame, because first of all you need realistic diets. You need to get into a dietary habit that you realistically can stick to. That means balanced  reasonably  portion meals are best. Secondly, you need carbohydrates... especially if you are working out. It's energy.  ***
