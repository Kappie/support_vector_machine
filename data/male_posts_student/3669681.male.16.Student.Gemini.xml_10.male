Most of the time I diagnose the problem as some sort of   spyware   or malware has been installed on the computer.  Some very common and nasty spyware programs are   Gator  ,   Weather Bug  , and   Bonzi Buddy  .      The steps to remove spyware are very easy. First you need to download some free utilities. Many companies will try to sell you software to remove spyware. Don't buy them. The programs below work a lot better and are FREE.      Spybot Search  Destroy    This is a Great Program.  When you first start it up be sure to check for updates and imunize your system.        AdAware    This program is also good.  Make sure to check for updates.      Another problem that people have is browser hijacks. If you have ever had you homepage changed without you changing it yourself, you have probably been hijacked. To remove these hijacks use the program CW Shredder.      CW Shredder    This program runs very fast so run it often!
