Anyway, I am so nervous because I have my first practice for All-County Chorus tomorrow. In case you don't know, I made All-County Chorus as a tenor, which puts the best singers of all the Harford County high schoolers together for a concert, which must mean I'm good. At the auditions, I was even more nervous, but now it's bad too. I have to sing two songs in different languages, one in German, one in Russian. The rest are in English. The only song I am familiar with is "Sing Praise to God With One Accord," the audition song.   Anyway, here's something to talk about: What kind of television interests everyone the most? I find that mysteries and sitcoms are the best. I used to like more stuff on The WB, but now all I like are 7th Heaven, Everwood, Smallville, Gilmore Girls, and an occasional Reba episode. What do you all watch? Tell me a little about yourselves in the process too. Visitors are definately welcome to comment. Make yourselves right at home. Have fun, blog you later!  In Christ, Mike  "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." -2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV  "Justice will be served and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage. You'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A. We'll put a boot in your a**. It's the American way!" -Toby Keith in  Courtesy of the Red White and Blue .
