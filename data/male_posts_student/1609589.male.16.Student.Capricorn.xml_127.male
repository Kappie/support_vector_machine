It's those 2 or 3 people who do wierd and stupid things like don't answer when you talk to them until you say something like "fine, dont talk to me..", the people who always, ALWAYS respond with one word answers. Bugs the hell out of me. If it werent for some cool people on aim, i'd quit using it. It's too useful.
