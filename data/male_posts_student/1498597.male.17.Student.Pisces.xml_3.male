I see a world thats quiet and peaceful.  It is serene...yet it is seriously fuckin' unsettlin'.  Somewhere, in another part of the world, there is someone, maybe even millions, dyin' slow, painful, agonizin' deaths, while we sit here in our quiet little suburb and "click-click-clack-click" away at our computers, unaware of it all.  Sorry, I have just been thinkin' about things like life and such;  how things can be so different at times.  You can look at somethin' one day, then look at it the next day and notice no change, no significance, no...nothin'.  But tally weeks, months, and years on that one thing, and it can unrecognizable, or reduced to nothin' but shit.  OK, OK...Anyway,  Josh, Eddie, and Nick  are on, so I'm gonna go talk to them instead of you dumbfucks...Er...wait a minute!  They are some of the only readers of this blog...well yer still dumbfucks!  Just kiddin'!
