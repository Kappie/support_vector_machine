I went to the gym to do some nice morning cardio...my mom went to the aerobics class. So after I finished the cardio, I was waiting for her to get out of the damn class but apparently the class never ends. So I did another 10 mins of cardio and they still weren't done. So I jus went to the aerobics class for another 15-20 mins. I don't mind it. All women except me :)...not that theres anyone even the least-bit attractive there.   Afterwards me and my friends went to see Spiderman 2. I was rele hoping that it would be good because I missed a good soccer game to see that movie. And thankfully, it was pretty sick. Better than the first one...possibly. One thing I found strange was that the theater was completely filled. Is it just me or does anyone else find it wierd that the theater should be full at 1:20 on a Wednesday? Doesn't anyone work on Staten Island?  Anyway, I'm home now. I plan on going to the gym again later to do some weight lifting. We ran out of the good protein shake, so now I'll probably hafto drink the crappy one...yuck..fuckin chocolate. I would seriously like to meet the idiot that thought of giving protein shake a chocolate flavor.   That's basically it for today. I'm going up-state this fourth of july weekend. Time to put that boating license to good use. Imma give water skiing another try. Maybe this time I can hold my ass steady on the skiis for more then 5 seconds. lol.   BTW, Nip Tuck was on last night. It was pretty cool. I love the way Christian broke his nose....for those of you who still haven't seen Nip Tuck, get the first season dvd! You won't regret it!
