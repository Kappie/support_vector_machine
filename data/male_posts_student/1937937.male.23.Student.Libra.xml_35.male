In case you're really curious, these fractals are generated by equations of the form:  urlLink    and they're really quite gorgeous when given good coloring.  I've seen much better than mine: there are some guys out there who have got images with a sort of shading that makes it look like they're colored in 3D -- it's hard to explain, but it looks awesome.  I'd like to find some use for these images, or other images like them.  There are a lot of cool pictures that can be made using mathematical equations, and I think when the pictures are cool enough, they even generate some interest in math.  I know that when I was a kid, I saw pictures of fractals, and it got me interested.  If you've got any interest in this stuff, please  urlLink e-mail me !
