This morning I woke up at 11:30 x_x, I REALLY need to start going to sleep earlier, especially since everyone goes to sleep in Tia's house at 11 and wakes up at 6-7ish. I wake up feeling kinda tired too, for some reason I think sleeping makes me more tired than I was before it.  After I woke up, I turned the computer on and did my daily routine, check BT sites XD and some other stuff. I got this blog =) and talked to mocchi. Then I ate waffles with cinnamon, *yum!* at around 1 and tried to get the music to work on this. I succeded, and if you haven't stopped it, you're listening to the lovely Namie Amuro's "Dreaming I was dreaming" =)!! Today has been so far kinda monotone x_x, but when you don't have the $$$ you really can't have fun here.  On friday I wanna go to BOOK-OFF before I move to Santo Domingo for the next 5 years x_x. I hope I find some goodies!!! I also wanna buy some snacks for the plane-ride. I'll see if anything else comes up and update again later =)! Baaai!
