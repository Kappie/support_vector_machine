He didn't, you fools, he's merely reclining in order to pursue things such as Uni, work and the employment of Oompa-Loompas. Does this make him such a bad person? I don't think so. At any rate, he most certainly hasn't quite finished with the  urlLink old website  yet.  Hell, I don't think the Mario Man has finished with it either. Go there and check out all those crazy emotional bombs. Has anybody else seen that movie Pi? As in the symbol? It's crazy - the final couple of scenes, after his epileptic fit, where he drills into his skull; whoah. Painful painful stuff. Hard to stomach, hard to watch. That sounds like a good title for a haiku poem. Hmmm.  "the world is changing. empires fall and we still bleed. I don't want to die."
