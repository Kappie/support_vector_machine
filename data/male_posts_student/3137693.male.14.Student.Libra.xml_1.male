Today actually went way better then i would have expected, i was "escourted" around the school by my friend Jamie Olsen which was a big help. In answer to some questions about yesterdays post, yes, the title was from an Oingo Boingo song ;).   CJH is definitely a big school, the halls are sorted by letters which kind of messed me up a few times today, im really not used to it and i like the layout of FJH a ton better just because FJH was my home.   I remember when i first went into FJH, i had came to register for 7th grade because my family built a new house in Farmington so i came from Woods Cross Elementry with absolutely no friends. I was so nervous, i could remember walking in and saying "holy crap, this is huge" because coming from a small elementry school and going into a massive Junior High can cause someone to go into a coma with fear.   My first day of school at FJH was scary as sin, i only knew the people that were in my ward and that was about it. One of my first friends was probably Adam Stewart in 5th period Gym - Coach Down's class. It was crazy and fun... it was also kinda stupid, but i got used to it.  Theres nowhere else i'd rather be than FJH, unfortunately, theres not much i can do about that.
