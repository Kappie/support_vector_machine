I love just hanging out with her shes so entertaining...im never bored with her. we always go to this place called hpvillage. if u havent heard of it ill tell u about it. its like a plaza thats has all these old looking buildings...they kinda have that mediteraining look. but anways its owned by one person so it has like the perfect combination of shops. there is a really small theatre there thats all like old looking and stuff. u can actually see it at regenttheatres.com. there are like different restaurants. our favorite is this italian restaurant. it has this pattio thats really cool  that we sit out on and share a pizza. But both of us just sneak out to this plaza place all the time. We kiss in the theatre sometimes. My birthday is this saturday...cant wait! were going to see a movie and hopefully she will let me kiss her. she is really pretty but she never gives herself a enough credit for how prety she is. sometimes i feal guilty because she is so beautiful and she dosnt know. i think that if she did she might not go out with me. but dont worry i tell her she is pretty. she just dosnt believe me.   i cant wait to see her again.
