It's a mood, in which... if I was in Irvine, I'd totally call up someone from the Posse for a trip to BJs or something. Just something to get out and do something.  I feel like I'm lacking something, but I don't know what it is... lack of security, lack of contenment with my current life, lack of things I desire...   Right now I really desire going out and doing  something .  Now playing: Descendents - "She Loves Me"  Dude, the past few songs that Winamp has been playing has been like of psuedo emo...  Social D  was playing before these two songs.  Ok I'm going to skip ahead to a song that will get me pumped up for  something .   Little Richard's "Good Golly Miss Molly" will do for now.  So at the same time there's desire and lack in my life, there's also avoidance... there are some truths and realities I don't want to deal with. For example, I have all these things I want to do, but don't do. There are all these things I shouldn't do that I do. There are a bunch of things I should do, that I sort of do.  It'd be nice to be motivated about more in life.... or simply  something .  Now playing: NOFX - "All Out of Angst"  I think if there's any word that really describes how I feel, it's incomplete. Doctor, cure me; what is the cause of my condition, This madness shoots me, Like bullets smashing glass in silent movie, I’m a trap without a spring, a temple with no god, A jack without an ace, the tip of your tongue, I’m a promise, an unmailed letter, An unbuilt motor, deck without a joker, A creeping gray memory I am incomplete...  - "Incomplete" by Bad Religion **
