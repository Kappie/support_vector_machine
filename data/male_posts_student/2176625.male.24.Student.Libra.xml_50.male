I've told them already and now it's time to tell you guys: I am not going to have a baby. Thinking that you might be responsible for putting a life on the planet puts your own life into perspective. I wanted it to be me. Have you ever wanted something so bad and you were almost there only to have someone take it away from you? That's how I feel.  My grandmother (the Catholic one) always told me God only gives you what you can manage. This situation happened for a reason, and though I'm crushed, there are bigger and better things waiting for me in the next months. Now I must decide if I'm going to Harvard or Yale.
