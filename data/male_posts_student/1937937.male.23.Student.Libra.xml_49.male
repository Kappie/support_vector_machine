I really love her, and I wanted to take "that next step".  Shit.  She seems to think that moving in together officially is actually going backwards somehow.  I guess her view is just different from mine.  Wrong, damn it!  She's wrong -- moving in together is getting closer, not farther apart.  I feel all fucked up over this.  I was supposed to work a bar shift tonight, and I bailed.  I just want to cry, but I feel so meladramatic about it.  At some point, she ended up suggesting that I start staying in my place during the week.  So when I got home, I picked up all of my shit and took it over to my house.  Now I'm in my house.  Ugh.  I don't want to be like this.  God, grant me the serenity... why do I feel so worked up about it?  It's not like she rejected me, she said she loves me and she actually said she was glad I was so upset about it, because it shows her that I wasn't coming from the "money" end of it.  But shit, what do I have to do?  I guess I understand -- I never believe that she loves me, either.  I hope things work out...
