One side Has my hopes of what I will become after highschool. it reminds me of how lucky I am to have the friends that I do. This side is the side of me that loves this place and the people that i know here. I love hangin out with My friends and I hope that after highschool we will keep in touch. I will come back to remember the times i have had here and to hang out with those that helped make those memorys.  The other side sees all the mistakes that I have made. It just wants to be out of highschool so that I can leave this place. It has no attachment to my friends because it does not see the point once I leave. It brings back the memorys of those that I have had feelings for, or "liked", and calls me a fool for hoping that someday somthing could come from them. I will never come back or speak to these people ever again.  I ask u, which do u think i should give into? I have made my choice with the help of a friend, jesus ,but still to those who i allow to read this which one do u think i should listen to?
