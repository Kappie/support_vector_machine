      Wow.  It's been awhile since anyone has posted anything here.  Sorry about that.  I'm here in Naples.  I obviously made it here alright, and I've just been hanging out, getting settled in and becoming more acquainted with the area, waiting to start work next week.  I have managed to go swimming, though the weather has been too lousy to really go out to the beach or anything.  I caught Farenheit 9/11 today at the theatre, which was really excellent.  I bought some new clothes, and have patronized the local used record store.  That's about it.    Nothing much new to report.  It's still a little strange being here, and not the most comfortable situation as the house I am staying in is still in the process of being furnished and fixed up, and it is also not going to be my permanent residence.  Nothing too interesting is coming to mind to post right this second, but I plan to get back into being online and hopefully posting more often very soon.  And hopefully Glenn will post something soon as well.  Later.
