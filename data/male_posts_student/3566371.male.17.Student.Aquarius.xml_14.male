I hung up some photo's at my closet, looks really nice. Feelin' kind of down again. I'm lost in my mind again. I'm now chatting with this girl who has an unipolar impairment (is that English?), anyway she has sort of the same thing I have and talking to her makes my feel that someone understands me, but she makes me think about things I don't want to think about.  A reason that I'm down at the moment could well be the fact that I discovered that my "dad" couldn't remember his kids (me) after his accident and properbly still can't remember them today. The only reason he knows that I'm his kid, is that people told him I am. That, my dear readers, is not a thing you want to hear. That is something that really ruÃ¯nes your day like nothing else ever did. But it ruined my day today. I guess I sort of felt it already before I knew. I never really felt loved by him. I hate everything about him. Why? particularair reason. I just do. If it were up to me, they'd put people like my dad away.  Belgian people talk funny   My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation
