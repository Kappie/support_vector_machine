My sole intention is to point out some shortcomings with GTK+ GUI development and what can be done to improve the current situation.     One and a half years ago I had the opportunity to start developing a GUI client for managing LDAP data. It was part of my work as a sysadmin at my university and I could get some certificates for this, too.   So, I started planning the design of Luma and what the final product should look like. The choice of the programming language was pretty easy for me. I took Python because it was intuitive, elegant and it provided bindings to the Qt and GTK+ toolkits. Although I'm a longtime KDE user, I was not biased on what toolkit I should use. My only requirement was, that it should be very easy to develop good looking user interfaces with a minimum of time and work. One of the tools to archieve this, is to use a visual GUI builder. Qt offers 'Qt Designer' and GTK+ has 'Glade' for this purpose.    After some hours with playing and testing these tools, my choice was pretty clear. Designer won hands down over Glade. And after 18 months of Luma development, I don't regret this decision. But what was the reason that I didn't give a chance to Glade, even for a few days?   Designer looked a lot more polished than Glade. It had some wizards and easy to use dialogs to connect widgets to functions. But hell NO! This was not the reason why I didn't like Glade. These were things I was willing to accept. I don't mind if a program has some rough edges, as long as I'm able to do my job. That's one of the reasons why I'm still using Linux on the desktop ;)    But what's the reason why I don't like Glade? It's a very simple thing. Glade gets into the way of the developer. You are not able to experiment with new ideas easily. Before you can add widgets like buttons and labels, you have to define a layout in which these items will be placed. You need to have a clear vision of what your widget should look like. But often this is not the case. The developer has several possible ideas in mind and isn't sure which one is the better solution. He knows what buttons, textfield and labels are needed. So he opens Designer, puts the widgets into the form and aligns the items as he wants them. Then he adds the layout. If he doesn't like the result, he can dismiss the layout, rearrange the items and tries a new design. This simple process is not possible with Glade. You are forced to define a layout first, so you have to know exactly what you want to do.     In my opinion this interferes with the creativity of the developer. People like to experiment and they often don't know what the final product should look like. GUI design is not an excact science like math, so GUI development tools should reflect this by giving the developer as much freedom as possible. Qt's Designer is a very good example for such a tool.     But why does it matter what I say? Thousands of developers are happily coding with GTK+/Glade and no one seems to complain. In most public diskussion on OSNews and Slashdot, people recommend Glade if you want a GUI builder for GTK+. Nothing seems to be wrong. Well, maybe I'm mistaken. But somehow I have the feeling that many GTK+ developers never tested Designer or that some don't want to admit that Glade is inferior. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to promote Qt in any way. I just want to point out one of  my  biggest problems with GTK+, altough I believe that many other people think the same way.     Improving Glade the way I propose would be a huge task, but in the end it helps GTK+ to be a more attractive development platform. It's not only the developer who will profit from this, but also the user. Better applications could be made in shorter time and this should benefit the Linux desktop in general.
