Two whole weeks!, trying my best not to notice Ern Leng but i couldn't today because i saw something detailed and it made me go so happy and high. The something is his crotch. Yeah! ok ok this maybe weird but Ern Leng is rated #1 in my Top#10 cutest/hottest Sec 3 guys in WRSS! Usually i don't get to see that small detail because its either he covers it with his bag/books or just hides well his dick. It was nice and round, means to say...  NICE SET OF BALLS AND DICK!  :p.  I was looking around for Mdm Anisah when his class had to go, sadly she was standing behind the guy of my dream and my eyes naughtily caught those nice round balls of his and nice set of butt. I was already melting at that time. It all came to a stopped when he went off. I did not see him again till recess.    During Recess, i did not eat my usual staple food but instead had a snack (STICKOs! i love them nice chocolate love letters! hahah). I was a little too lonely because i had no one to be with and talk to. My bestfriend, Rashid, was with his usual bitchy gang, Azah was with her friends, my little sister was a told to do duty in the hall and others were to busy gobbling their food. Well so i decided to walk around the school. Till i needed to talk to Syazwanie. I knew i could always find here where she will always be, which is just right out side the canteen of course...near the field. That is where Ern Leng love to be with his other friends, who are some in my top ten cutest/hottest Sec 3 guys in WRSS. When i went to ask Syazwanie something, He was already there. I knew he was there but i tried to ignore him, which i couldn't because he was looking at me. Syazwanie and her friends were squatting down on the ground like top secret agents discussing something secret till i felt that someone was look over me, i poked my head up to the left...no one was there...turned my head to the right... i saw Mr Koh Ern Leng look at me. Once i got sight of him, he quickly turn away.    "What is up with that cute guy? Does he know that i have a crush on him? Is it too obvious that i have a crush on him? Why is he looking at me in that way? Why when i try to ignore him, he tries to get close to me, and when i try to get close to him, he tries to ignore me. What kind of Cat and Mouse game is this? Oh! i just wish he is gay. He is so cute! so adorable! so kind! so smart! but abit on the anti-social side. Haiz...", i said that in my heart everytime when i see him.     In the hall i couldn't decide to sit at first i was wanting to sit infront but then i changed my mind to sit at the back because i wanted to hand in the form to Mdm Anisah. Suddenly i bumped into, Yup!, Ern Leng. I apologised softly and walked away quickly with out look at him. I was facing the ground all the while. My face was totally  RED!  When i sat down i tried to look around for Mdm Anisah but couldn't because she was not in the hall. I could see Ern Leng face was a little red, maybe its my imagination.    After school, i went to Eliza's class, which is the same class with Ern Leng of course. At that when i entered, sadly Ern Leng was getting ready to go off. I came into the class and asked around my friends to walk home with me. I did not look or peek at Ern Leng's face when i entered and when he left. Sadly i just wish, just  WISH!  one day that he would just one day say Hi to me. If that were to happen, my heart is going melt and i am going to faint!, but oh well... it won't happen in a  MILLION  years.    All this while i have been thinking of  Ern Leng, Ern Leng, Ern Leng and more of KOH ERN LENG!  He is  god dame superbly scrumptiously deliciously fabulously gayishly CUTE! Man!  that was long description of him hahaha. Well just hope one day, One day... i will be able to talk to that nice guy and take a photo of him. So far i have made step one! try to be friends with his friends ... hehehehe :P... well so far only one. Hahah.
