I found a 1-6 torrent... but thats it, all the rest i found was actually in finnish... and i can't read finnish.   I also located a complete Onegai Teacher torrent, so i'm really happy about that, and while i was seraching, guess what i found?  Boxtorrents is back!!  And up to it's old schemes again ^_^  Woot.  Now if only the server could hold more people.. it's still a bit buggy right now, but it does have a lot of it's old material (unlike downloadanime.org, who was also talked to for the same thing). Good times ^_^  Lates
