Seeta is in it, I'm sure she'll be awesome, i always think shes great...i might tell her differently, but what the hell...now you know.   Something about the packing made me think; do i have anything useful to bring? some divine knowledge to share? the answer is do i hell. it scares me; what do i have to offer. a mediocre (spelling) actor, with maybe a little bit of natural talent, nothing else.   scoury is an excelent actor, and i have alot of respect for him because of it. i hope to be as good as him, maybe someday i will be. who knows? liam is alo a good actor, and i also respect him. i hope they all do well.  well goodbye.
