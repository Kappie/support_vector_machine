Didn't get any sales but the canadian lady said that they don't usual get sales at are location. It was cool because I get 7 untaxed and hour into my account which pays for summer camp/high adventure/hats/etc.. I also got a chance to do some coding. Iv been messing with KiXtart2001 latley. It's reaaally cool. Free. Nice. and such :). Im currently working on a script for lan partys that you can run and it installs steam, installs steam skin, installs mcafee virus scanner, and installs spybot. Ntoe that it doesn't install whats not needed to be installed and also it runs a full virus scan/updates dats/checks for spyware automaticly.. well it will. Currently it just checks and installs for steam and a skin I made for it.  A little bit ago I did some more work on my project psPortal. I don't quite remember what ps standed for but im sure its something about poop in stance. Most of the stuff im doing right now is just brainstorming for ideas for things like skinning system, etc.. The DBD (database drivers) are very plain but they should work (I wrote a mysql dbd and a postgresql dbd). I belive I have something going with my INI style skinning system but it is going to take a lot of coding!  Another thing I noticed today is PHPEDIT COSTS MONEY!! I didn't belive it but I saw it prompt me when I installed it on my computer. So while looking for a "way around" registration I stumbled apon a few "way around" registration for PhpED and it made me thing "Hmmmmm Zend Studio blows, PHPEdit now blows, Pico blows, xEmacs sortof blows, maby this one doesn't blow" so I downloaded a trail and yes it is the r0x0r! It is so much more stable then Zend and is not FREAKING JAVA (I HATE JAVA) so theres a plus right there. It comes with lots of documentation and the editor area is very nice. The CVS intergration IS SOOOOOOOOO NICE!! I regret ever learning comandline CVS now that I can just right click on the file and do updates, commits, edit locks, you name it (and it has to do with CVS) and PhpED does it! If I had the cash I would buy it!  Tomarow (Well today) Mike Z and maby Matt and I decided to go to rinky dink (batting cadges, go carts, mini gold, etc..) so we should have a tits time and I will most likley walk away with a few more colored golf balls :)  Screw y'all, Jeff
