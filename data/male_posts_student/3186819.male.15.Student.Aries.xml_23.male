It is so annoying. No wonder why the TV show ER is so good. It wouldn't surprise me if they all had medical degrees, because I am sure half of med school is acting class. Bloody hell.  Well, I don't have much else to say. I really don't. Why are you still reading? I said I was done. Okay, now you need a life! Still reading, eh? Loser. Looooossserrr! If you are still reading by now you will be fat, ugly, and unpopular for the next .000254 seconds. Yeah, thats right, you heard me. .000254. Take that. Take that to the moon and bring me back some cheese. Wow, you are STILL reading. Bloody hell.................      (am I done yet) yes, yes I am
