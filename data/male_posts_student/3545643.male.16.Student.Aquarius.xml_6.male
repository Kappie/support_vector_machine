I guess I either like trying to help people or it makes me feel better knowing that my life isn't as bad as it seems. Either way i listen to alot of peoples problems, and I think im getting good with advice. Any ways. If u need some one to talk to, thats me, I guess. I make a good sholder to cry on.
