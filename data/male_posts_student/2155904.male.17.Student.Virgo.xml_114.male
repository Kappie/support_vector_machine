And absolutely no need to do any homework at night so it was pretty much perfect.  1st period was fine.  Tyke made it fun as usual.  And he got loaded up with tickets.  Loaded.  2nd period was cool cuz it was legs day.  Legs day is the only day in which Tyke is the strongest in his group.  So he just goes around and does pretty much every leg exercise and it is fun.  Especially calf raises.  If he had a little calf-raise machine at home he would use it all the time.  Cuz he loves working the old calfs.  It makes him jump higher ya know.  Which means getting closer to dunking.  That is his most immediate goal in life.  To be able to dunk.  Somewhat lofty for a 5'11" white boy.  But he is pretty skinny and has semi-strong legs.  But it was funny today cuz for 5x4x3x2x1 he was doing squats and it came to 2 reps and he just decided to do 175.  And the first rep was a little challenging and then the second one was pretty hard but then he got to 1 rep and put on 185.  And he did that really easily.  Like he felt like he could add 30 pounds and still do it just as easily.  Which is kind of odd but whatever.  You probably don't care about any of Tyke's weight training stories though.  So he will digress.  3rd period.  Interesting little period.  Some more pauses in lecture because the class "was talking" and all this other stupid shit like how everyone "needs to memorize" this and that.  Bullshit.  Nobody needs to ever know all this crap.  Most of it, probably.  But all of it?  Hell no.  And nobody cares either.  Other than a few people.  Tyke isn't totally decided about taking that AP test either.  He has hardly payed attention all year so he is at a bit of a disadvantage and it would just be a waste of his parents money.  Even though he would most likely get at least a 3.  He knows he ain't taking the AP English test.  That will be a bitch.  And Tyke won't be able to say ain't or won't in it and those are two of the greatest words ever.  Mainly ain't.  It ain't no thang.  4th period involved a really gay quiz.  This was flaming.  Really badly done.  Stupid Oedipus.  Tyke even read you.  Mostly.  Somewhat.  Well, he read the majority at least.  Lunch was fun and they went to Pie.  No cheese there so Tyke had to get pep.  It just isn't as good as plain cheese.  Loaded up with the peppers though.  No parmesan like Dr. Phil though.  Damn man.  Doc P just eats like double the cheese with all of the cheese he adds to the pizza.  Crazy man.  But wise beyond his years.  Sorta.  Enough though.  5th period was boring but thats ok.  It doesn't matter.  Cuz 6th period was fun.  Tyke and Kinker made up some good Laker/dynasty analogies to their situation with the Sly Lioners.  They are Shaq and Kobe.  Of course Tyke is Shaq because of his inside dominance (no, really that is who he is in this scenario) and Kinker is Kobe because of his domination (at times) of the outside and dribbling skills and all that.  Oh, and the raping.  Just kidding.  Kinker ain't a rapist.  At least convicted...But after school Tyke smelled Purdy's car and it stinks.  Nice transition huh ;-)  Yeah, Tyke was in it the week before break and he mentioned it stankonia'd and then it just got magnanimously worse  because it didn't get cleaned.  So now it smells identical (you can have identical smells right??) to Tyke's garbage when there is a lot of rotten food in it.  That is just gross.  How can she handle the stench of ewwww?  Must not be human.  Could she be a cyborg???  That was a bit of an inside joke for all of you who didn't know.  Not just a blank reference to cyborgs.  After the sniffing Tyke went home and watched some tv and ate some food and then he went upstairs and decided to dl some music.  He just kept dling and made a new CD.  It is titled "BCL's Celebration of Black History Month."  Kind of ironic seeing as only 7 songs are by a group that has any "Afro-American" (another inside joke) in them.  Oh man, this was a fun blog.  Tyke has to end while he is ahead though.  Sew maybe he should leaf.  Amed is weird.  But funny.  Tyke wanted to say that earlier but he had no place so it obviously fits in here at the end.  Man, Tyke blogs a lot.  Yeesh, what a stud.
