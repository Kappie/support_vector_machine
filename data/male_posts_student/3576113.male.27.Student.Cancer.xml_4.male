In this: a woman is struck head on and is pinned within her car.  Unable to do anything I merely hold her hand and listen to her ramblings as death comes and claims her.  Not much of a dream analyst I'm left to carry a piece of despair with me on this day.  "Things I remember, things I forget.  I miss you,  I guess that I should.  3500 miles away, what you would you change if you could?" - Raining in Baltimore, Counting Crows
