I spent about 2 and a half hours in a dog costume raising money for a Charity called Pals With Paws, Pals with Paws a part of a charity called Dogs for the disabled, here's the official site.    urlLink   http://www.dogsforthedisabled.org/      . Pals with Paws is my favourite charity because they train guidedogs to help disabled children, pretty nice people :).           Anyhoot with the weather being a bit "too" hot today I've been roasting my ass off in a dog costume! Was kind of funny though, I really slipped into the role! LOL. I was crying when kids were crying, I was scaring people from behind shelves and all the customers loved it! I kind of enjoyed it too, I got to piss about at work! Teehee. I raised £20 for Pals With Paws, giving me a personal total of over £250 now, which I'm very proud of.          Bad News about the task peeps, I gotta postpone it till Monday because I am knackered from work and believe I'll be just as knickyknackered tomorrow. Sorry!          TTFN: Jim
