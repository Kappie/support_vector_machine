Well for once, I dont care if people notice me. I want her to notice me, I want her to realize who I am. I give this girl everything, I put her on top of the world, bow down on my knees and treat her like the Princess she is. Although, now I've had it. I have completely gone broke now. I have spent all my paychecks and have overdrawn my bank account because EVERYDAY I have gone up and seen her, taken her out to eat, drove around, done anything she wanted. All I ever got was a simple "Thank you". I dont expect money or an award or anything but I would like some appreciation. I do all this and more for her and all I get is treated like dirt and bitched at. Today for instance, I told her last night that "I might be able to stop up tommorow around 1". Well last night I painted the interior of my car and I expected to have it dry and all installed by 1 today. Well of course, I didn't have it done, and I called her about 12 to tell her that my car wasn't finished and I couldnt be on time. Well of course, she got mad at something unexpected. (Which I expected her to be mad) Well then I go out and try to have it all dry and it wasnt working. I got frustrated and put all the parts into my car with wet paint, then I drove up to see her. I showed up at her house around 4 and she wanted nothing to do with me. This has been the 4th time she has gotten mad at me for something I did that I didn't expect to happen, and I had enough, I left. As I'm leaving, she comes out and asks what my problem is? She asks me why I screwed her over for me car?, and why I put my car over her and I care more about my car than her and I just LOST it on her. I flipped and asked her why she has been treating me like dirt lately, when I give her everything I possibly can. She asked back "Why did you treat me like dirt when I treated you good before?" Speechless, I looked down and said that I "was an ASS and was very wrong" and that I regret every bit of it. She said its "not a nice feeling is it?" which was her acknowledgement of her bad-treatment to me. She then started rubbing it in my face that I was a liar and a cheater and that I will never change. In shock, I told her that she was being a bitch, which was a big mistake, first off it's not right to say that and it was mean cause she is my girlfriend, but she was being soo mean to me when I havent done anything wrong. I cheated on her back in January. 7 months ago, and to this day, she acts like it was yesterday. Protecting herself, she started assuming that I was with another girl this morning and I wasnt painting my car. I guess the paint on my clothes, the paint all over my fingers and face, and the wet tacky paint on the doors ment nothing to her. For sure it was just for her protection. Yes, I truely feel that there is someone else in her life. Maybe she hasnt done anything wrong, but she may be thinking about it. She has a "best friend" named Mike, who she never talked to until about a few weeks ago. Everynight I call her, her line is busy, or she picks up and I ask her if she is on the phone and she says yes "It's just Mike hunny, dont worry" and says shell call me when she gets off. *(Thats at about 9pm) around 3 in the morning, I'm laying on the couch, waiting for her to call. Thinking maybe she fell asleep on accident, I call her, she's still on the phone. I trust him to an extend, but how can she be on the phone with this guy for SOO long and talk about "nothing" like she says? I'm losing my trust in her because everytime I turn around shes talking to him, and she will talk to him over me. She's always on the phone with him. More than me. She tells me that she doesnt talk to me as much because I'm always busy, but she used to call me at work, call me while I was working at home, Now, I'm not really that busy but she says I am. I stay up at night, hoping she will call me, but she doesnt until about 2 or 3 in the morning, and I know shes not online the whole time cause I even checked a few times. Is she seeing him? or is she seeing somebody else? Even if she isnt seeing somebody else, I think shes thinking about seeing somebody. I feel as if she is drifting away and I'm trying so hard to keep her, everything possible. This website for one. While shes on the phone with HIM, I'm here writing stuff that I cant even talk to her about anymore cause she gets mad. I just wish she would treat me a little better. I know that you cant tell if i person has changed in only a week, but she wont believe that im different, that I am trying. She has broken a promise to me, which is killing me inside. She promised that if I tried the way I did before, that she would try. But she isnt holding up her end of the deal. She isnt trying at all. She is sitting there making plans for us that are impossible for me and then when I cant, That makes me the bad guy and I'm not trying. When was the last time she came to see me? when was the last time she wanted to spend time with me. And not her friend, go to the mall and drive, spend time with me. I found a spot I really wanted to take her to watch the Sunset, which is kinda gay but ya know, I thought itd be a lil romantic and what not but she wanted to go drive around, go to the mall, go see her uncle and all this stuff just for her. I'm trying soo hard for US, but all she wants me to try for is me to make her happy. I can seriously say that I'm not happy. All I've done is make her happy. Inside, I am happy with myself because I have done everything right, and been myself. But emotionally, I'm dying inside. I'm giving my heart to her, and I feel like she is kicking it around like a toy and she doesn't care. What happened to the girl I fell in love with? Who is she with? What happened to the girl that layed down with me while I explained the reasons I love her, the girl that I layed down with and for every letter in the Alphabet, there was a word that described her in a way that nobody else knows her. Well I don't even know her anymore. She is just a monster that is playing with my heart when she knows that I'm giving her my all. Yes it has taken me a while to get my goals straight with her, At first I cheated on her, then I didnt know what to do. But now I do, I want to be with her, I can't find anyone like her in the world. She is unique, she is, my baby. But shes not there for me in the ways she was before. Im here for her, giving her everything, but she doesnt care, shes treating me like there is someone else. I just need some answers. I'm myself, why isn't she herself?
