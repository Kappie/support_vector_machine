If anyone read that letter that I written to Menwa you would see me expressing myself. Well I tried to view that at school, everything up till that post showed up. After that post, it gave me some  bullshit  excuse me, please Mr/Ms/Mrs. Proxy (I don't discriminate) don't block it,  about there being too many  cuss  profane words in the post. Anyway, I've been playing that  urlLink KoC  thing, it pretty interesting once you get into it, but the only problem is that they are running PHP and MySQL on two servers and there are about 170,000 people or so. Those puny servers can't handle it. One good thing is that there aren't any spammers or anything like that.  Life is going well and sober. I almost given up on those damn comics cause  urlLink keenspace  sucks  dick  I mean dock. It sucks a lot of docks...  Damn  it I am a  fucking  failure.  Shit!
