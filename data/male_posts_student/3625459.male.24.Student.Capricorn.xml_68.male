Never fall for a friend , it never works out. Why is it that im always stuck up as this guy whos there for the moment? Looking back there's nothing that i can look at and say i was happy to do it.    Everything was so crazy I think i was havin fun Lost in your arms I was living a dream  Till i heard you say he's back All the same feelings that You had for him in the past I let go and try getting over with          No body wants to be stuck with a loser like me.
