I walk up to the stage for some reason, and I notice that everyone onstage is looking at me. Peter Moore drags me up on stage, but he's all acting like a blue man, so it's odd. I get the feeling he lost his voice or something. He points to a microphone, and the band starts playing The Current.  I don't know exactly what that means/if it means anything, but i'm starting to think that my mind feels guilty for leaving choir/a couple good friends behind. But, then I realize that I left choir because it's been a shit to me ever since I joined it, and I'm better off without it.  So this post wasn't funny, or stabbed at society. Suck it up and get over it.
