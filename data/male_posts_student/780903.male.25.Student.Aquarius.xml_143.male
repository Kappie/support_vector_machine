She says we have too many regulations, and so lawyers and legislators control the world because they control the rules that everyone has to follow, by being the only ones who get to make and interpret them.  She's saying the Court system is bad because the "making, manipulation, and selective enforcement of laws" is bad.  She says lawyers are only after money and power, and they're evil, and they're self-interested.  They're one day lobbying and the next day writing our laws, while the rest of us sit on the sidelines.  I say "they" like I'm not going to soon be one of them.
