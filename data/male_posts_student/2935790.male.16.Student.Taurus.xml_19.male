You also agree that the person who wrote this is in no way responsible for anything you do.     If you're going to slit your wrists, how about instead of talking about it you  finish the job ? Cutting your wrists = suicide! What a novel idea! I'd go out on a limb and say the world is better off without you taking up our air, and our black paint, and our ugliness. Nevermind, keep the ugliness, just GO, or in the words of my outspoken, unnamed internet buddy, GTFO! I'll  pay  you to die. PLEASE. JUST GTFO, I DON'T WANT YOU HERE ANYMORE. LEAAAVE. Jackasses, get a friggin' I.Q.. Here's some truth to cry about; no one loves you. That's why you're a Goth in the first place right? Same with 'hardcore anarchists'. Anarchy, as far as I know, comes from the French  laissez-faire , which means 'let it be'. I'm pretty sure it was a pseudo-neutral political party. Anarchy doesn't mean rebel, it means leave shit alone! Quite the opposite if you ask me.     A new guy at school, I think his name is brain-dead moron, once said to me, "You know, total anarchy can't exist because there will always be one organization to take down all the others." Hey, dildo, do you know what anarchy means? No? Eat my rubber. You know the evolution of the human race is slowed every day by people like you? No? Eat my plastic. I actually think I'd prefer looking at feces over looking at an 'anarchist' because that way I don't have to brace myself for inane remarks. Everyone on earth exists because there is some agreement between the people that live on earth.  If you don't agree, then don't live. It's that simple.     In conclusion, the more you brag about being an anarchist or a Goth or a shit head, the more you deserve to be shot, and when I become president of the world, you will see just how right I am. Want to have a cause? Want to be against a cause? NO! NO NO NO! Maddox put it best in the heading 'Looking for a safe stance on abortion? Me neither', and I'd say it's safe to replace 'abortion' with anarchy, atheism (or religion in general), feminism, or any other stupid cause that these inbreds can come up with. I'm starting a cause. It's called   logicism  . Get smart or GTFO. I urge you to be  logicist , too. You know why I can force people to join my cause? Because technically the people who aren't  logicist  are stupid, and I'm right. Do you want to be stupid? Then don't join my cause. If you are smart, feel free to call yourself  logicist , and go enforce your extremely correct opinions on others, and keep working at it until one day you're almost as right as I am.  Love, Sean
