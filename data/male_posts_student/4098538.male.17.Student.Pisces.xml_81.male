It was like a reunion because so many of my friends came! There was Scott, Buffon, Daniel and his girlfriend, John, Amy, Chris and his girlfriend, Gav, Kyle, Becky, and not forgetting my angel, Mandy! There were the usual faces too... Jenny, Ellin and Ashley. It was so damn cool. After the whole thing, Mandy came back to my house and we went to sleep. Aw, she looks so lovely when she's peaceful. I love just holding her and knowing she's right there, 'cause sometimes I'll think 'aw I really want a hug so bad' and then I'll realise she's right there! It's great! Last night, I actually bought my own drinks and my own food for once. Kinda shocking? Anyway, I just took her to the bus stop 'cause she's going to college to finish some work, and then, she's gonna come see moi! I know you're gonna read this when you get to college Mandy, so, I love you lots and I'm thinking about you 24/7. Hope you're okay! Scott was overly generous and bought everyone a pint and later on in the night bought some of us shots of vodka, which made me vomit all over the floor! Yemateeee. He's a cool guy though. Haven't seen him since high school and he hasn't really changed, which I'm glad of. Buffon dissappeared in the middle of the night (as usual). I dunno where he went but I remember getting a message off of him saying he was outside and he was gonna wait at the door... which confused me. Ah well. Daniel is still exactly the same as last time, except now a little more respectful towards people which is pretty good. He's still really funny and charasmatic. Can't really say much about John as I've only met him a few times but he's very funny but something about him intimidates me. Can't really say anything about Amy either because she's one of them people you don't really get to talk to because they know practically everybody. Chris... well I'm glad he was there, he always makes me laugh. But I think alcohol alters his sexuality as everytime Mandy introduced me to somebody, he would be hugging me, feeling me up... etc. Not so nice. Kicked his ass at pool by default! Well, he potted the black and the white so I won and played Daniel, and lost. Shame mate. We went into the girls toilets with Mandy and her friends and it was pretty cool. Their toilets are so much nicer, they have blue glowy light things, and we don't! Some girl told me I looked like 'a girl who looks like a dyke who looks like a guy'. I actually took it as a compliment. Chris' girlfriend Nicola still seemed the shy little thing she is. Had a little chat with her about my vodka incident and she tried offering me hers... I think I put her off, hahaha. She helped me steal some really cool skeleton glasses though. Gav was being the usual loud-ass, drunk-ass 'anarchist' that he is with his 'sex grooves' and screaming on the dance floor, especially when they played Sex Pistols. He stood on some fat shits foot and she's like, 'Ouchhh my foot, watch it shithead!' and I said, 'How the fuck can you miss that fat-ass foot?' Ughhh it was so rank! He's kinda predictable. He chatted some women up on the way home and he actually got their numbers, somehow. Kyle is an old friend, from when I was with Donna. Donna used to live in Bristol and she had a friend there called Claire, who was with Kyle. Kyle wanted to go and visit her but not alone so he invited me. Ahh that was a cool weekend too. It was cool bumping into him though... don't talk to him much these days. Becky is also a kind of old (ish) friend. Chris met her a few years ago on a bus and he introduced me to her at a concert last year. Ever since then I regularly bump into her and have a chat or whatever. Well last night, it was her birthday so she was pretty happy which was pretty good! Jenny's hair is different everytime I see it. This time it was her actual hair (no extensions) AND it was all one colour! Didn't get to talk to her 'cause she got dragged away... ah well. Ellin was very talkative last night. She told me all about God Forbid on their recent UK tour (she was lucky enough to join them). Apparently she gets majorly insulted on the Chimaira message board so I think I'm gonna go there and say a few words myself against them. Ashley... she actually annoyed me last night. She is completely overly loud when she gets drunk, to the point of complete irritation. But ah well, she looked happy and she was smiling, so I'm not too bothered. If only I took a damn camera...
