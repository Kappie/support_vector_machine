The pain in my stomache was too much to bear any longer so I couldn't be arsed to go back to school because it hurt so much.  So that's that. No more school for me! Probably not going back in September so it could be seriously - no more English school for me! And thank god for that, the system mainly sucks anyway. So what's happening in the Summer?  Going France tomorrow, then going to London for a couple of nights afterwards! Lots of sights to see and pigeons to step on. Getting back sometime on Sunday and probably having a week or two at home. Hopefully then we will be going Alton Towers to stay in the hotel! I really wanna go back there it's so cool!  I might not be able to post on my blog anywhere from France or London unless I'm lucky enough to find somewhere with Internet access. So until Sunday, cya!
