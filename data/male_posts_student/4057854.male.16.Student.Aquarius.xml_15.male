I personally don't believe many of the articles writen in there, but who knows, maybe google is trying to get money by selling your personal searches to a third party advertising company.   urlLink   http://www.googlefight.com/  this site offers a cool service that lets you enter 2 search terms and gives you the number of google results for each term and tells you who is the winner.  One of the best search term to try is "Microsoft vs. Linux" the results are pretty close, see for yourself who wins ;-)
