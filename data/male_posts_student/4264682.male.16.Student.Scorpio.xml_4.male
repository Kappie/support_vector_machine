Now go away and get out of my hair... or leave me lots of cool comments about what I should remark on.  Anyways, school starts here soon, I'm ready to graduate next spring. I hate my job. Sometimes I wish I had a money tree. Actually, I can't think of a time when I wouldn't like a money tree, although there are things I'd rather have. Feel free to leave comments on what I should write about next. (Catching a theme here?)  To follow up my friend's tradition to an extent, the theme band for my blog until I decide a different band is the theme is  Slick Shoes  (www.slickshoes.net).
