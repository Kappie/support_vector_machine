We went out for a beer in Westwood and did some catching up talk. It was a nice evening with an old friend. I really understood her whole thing about needing something, when there's no show for you to feel a little pain and let go of some aggression. It makes me look forward to seeing the Vandals... that is if someone will just go with me!  Worked today... it was a fairly ok day. That's $60 more for me. I did some chatting with Lisa... not sure why. I guess I can't help but be friendly to my co-workers... even good old Margarita. I think certain people in the company can learn from me... not to be praising myself or anything.  Alas nothing is going on this week, except for hanging out with Flo before she goes to Texas. Perhaps I'll practice violin? Pick up a hobby? It has yet to be determined.  ***
