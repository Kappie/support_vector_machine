I managed to get a big stack of books from the library and do some reading. I read some of the Poster, Olin, etc. book on how Orange County is post-suburban and some Baudrillard. Really interesting stuff. I need to read more of the "classics" such as Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, and Althusser. I'm so behind on that.   On campus I ran into Ev, Ali, Alex, David, Janet, and Mike, and talked to Marc in his office. Not to mention I saw lots of familiar faces on the campus. I guess I've been in Irvine forever so I've got a lot of connections.  Now listening to some  Dropkick Murphys ...  Do or Die . Man... I'm actually looking forward to that more than  Alkaline Trio . It's cause I know it'll be a killer crowd. There should be about 300 very rowdy hardcore Murphys fans there. Heh... I hope Steff can handle it.   Speaking of the Murphys... I forgot to mention that I saw a dude in a kilt wearing a Murphys shirt at Disneyland.  ****
