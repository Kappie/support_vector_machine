I'm not suggesting anything, but I'm just saying it would be interesting to change decisions in the past and see how everything pans out for better or for worse.  The reason I talk about this is because I have been recently considering leaving the IB program and my current occupation of the high school in Thornton. It seems like an easy decision -- leave or go -- but to me it is more of leaving behind my past, my friends, my acquaintainces, my work, everything I have known, only to fall into another risky environment with more people I don't know and more work to be done. I say I hate a lot of my friends. I say I hate a lot of the work I get. I say I hate a lot of, well, everything. The fact of the matter is that when it boils down to a point where you absolutely need to decide if you take that left or that right, if you take the blue or the red, if you take the one or the two, you become nostalgic and critical of possibilities, you value that which you will never discuss with your inner ego.   Disagree if you will, but look back to a situation where you were knee deep in it and you could choose to go deeper or get out of the water while you still could. Now you can remember that wrenching ache in your throat, your eyes burning and pushing out from the inside, your mouth trying to keep from frowning and quivering into a state of breakdown. That is the decision you make, and that is the decision that will change the next chapter of your life  forever.   So what did you do? Did you take the road with the half completed map and the signs on the side that you get to fill in, or did you get of your car and go back to that foreign city a mile back? Either way, things are as they are now, and if they weren't, you would not be who you are today. The question at hand is whether I leave behind that map I've already drawn only to start on a new one, or I simply go with the road and fill out the signs. I don't know, its all too much to decide.  I'll let you think on that for a while I talk to potentially future-former acquaintances.
