Since the first of January my harddrive has been in the hands of PC Guru, a data recovery expert. It's major surgery guys. It's been weeks that they've been working on it.  So, I unfortunately do not have the  Blackbird  title cards. I also will have to track the font back down that we used (anyone remember its name?).
