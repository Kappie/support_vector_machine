I've seen some good shows in the festival here, but this...it was far and away the best. They were funky, energetic, had some great music, and could jam like no others. The highlight of the show was easily the ending--the last song of the main set was the famous "Love Rollercoaster" (1/2 the reason I came to the show, as my beloved Red Hot Chili Peppers did a fantastic rendition of it back in '96 or '97), with a funky 10 minute jam afterwards, before an almost entirely instrumental encore that must have lasted at least 10, 15 minutes. They really pumped the crowd up, and I had to resist a LOT of urges not to jump around like an idiot. Just amazing...wow...
