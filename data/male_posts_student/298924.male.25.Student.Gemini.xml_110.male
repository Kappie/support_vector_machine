So yesterday I had another OSCE....I'm sure I talked about OSCE's before....this one went pretty smoothly beside my one classmate acting an ass....you know that joke from Kings of Comedy where DL Hughely talks about the one person at everyone's job whose ass everyone wants to beat....well this guy is the prototype....and I really hope to God that I'm not the one who does what everyone else wants to do and introduces him to a hard, fast-flying fist....
