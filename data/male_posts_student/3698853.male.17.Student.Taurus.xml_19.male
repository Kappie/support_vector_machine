What happens?! What am I missing?! Oh it's terrible, I've been deteriorating both mentally and physically. I realize this, and yet, I keep playing? WHY?! What is it about those flashing colors and harmonized symphony of sounds that keeps me glued to the couch? Like a moth to the flame (-_-). At first I thought that if I beat the game, I would be through with the damned thing, but it wasn't enough. I thought it was just the suspense relating to the story's ending that kept me planted, and to some extent, it was. However, the true culprit? My need to complete it. This game, unlike others I've played less-than recently (rather, I should say "sequentially prior to"), has seemingly endless sidequests and possible outcomes that keep that 99% from reaching 100%. I'm currently at 99% completion. I'd rather not touch the thing again, but now, I've read that there is a "final" ending (-_-) achievable only via 100% completion. That would mean, another at-least-60 hour session of playing. My eyes are burning. This definitely cannot be healthy. I've even lost contact with the internet. To put it plainly: it's sad. I have been conquered. I never really, truly had a strong will with which to begin (I can foresee overeating a prominent problem in my future Â¦B). At least, after I got through the storyline the first time, I began sleeping, eating, and showering on my regular schedule. I wasn't thoroughly absorbed to the brink of death or imagining the world had switched places with the game world (a.k.a., insane). I wish I had that thing inside me, er... inhibition? something to fight my urge to play those games. I know I said laziness was supposed to have died, but this lovely wrench has managed to stick itself betwen my cogs. *sigh* I suppose I am incapable of change. Yes... So the story goes... I want to start over. I know once summer ends, I'll regret having wasted it so carelessly on such a frivolity. But no one ever does anything about it! They just stand on the sidelines and watch. I guess that's really all they can do now. I'm supposed to be all grown-up and mature and responsible and strong enough not to use polysyndeton so often (-_-). This must be one of those tests in life. Perhaps it is not so difficult as one would think or in comparison to others' struggles, but to me, I can't quit. It seems so silly from a distance, but if you could only come inside to the nuthouse, you'd see just how insane I am as well as how hard I'm trying. whine whine whine, complain complain, I know. Next paragraph. _Anyways, I've had much going on in my head (after the second cycle of the storyline, much of the twice-completed game becomes routine and not needing of full attention). It' just too bad I forgot most of it (-_-). I do remember my fortune cookie from Panda Express. It was empty. No fortune. Isn't that terrible? You'd think they'd at least have the common decency to insult me with their psychobabble, but apparently, they'd rather threaten me with the prospect of death (or at least, I think that's how the superstition goes). You know? one of those ancient Chinese folktales-- Oh wait! that's right, the fortune cookie was created here in America (-_-)  _I suddenly remembered one of the things I wanted to talk about! heh. It's actually kinda silly, but if you take my life experiences and add in a few explosions, gun shots, and rippling muscles here and there, my life would be a slo-mo action film (or is that list the entire contingency and standard for an action flick?). Take for instance: we were at the Outback Steakhouse and I couldn't decide. Cyclone chicken or the fried shrimp? I saw the waitress out of the corner of my eye: she was fast-approaching our table. I could feel my palms beginning to perspire. which would it be? my eyes darted back and forth, my mind listing the pros and cons, the consequences of either choice. No! I can think under this pressure! I glanced up from the menu for only an instant, and there before the table's edge was the black apron. I watched as a hand reached into one of the pouches, retrieving a pad of paper and pencil. Time was running out. My paternal parental unit had already begun to order. Then my mind became flooded with questions: which was the better deal? how hungry was I? How could the waitress expect the order of drinks and appetizers warm-up enough for the main course ordering?! This was no time to dwell on off-topic thoughts! I needed to recollect myself, but then, my maternal parental unit had already finished her order! Red wire?! Blue wire?! They both looked equally appetizing, but ordering one meant not having the other. I'd just eaten BBQ chicken on my frozen pizza for lunch, but then again, we had coconut shrimp as appetizers! NOooooO! she had arrived at me. One instant seemed to drag on forever, and I, like a deer in the spotlights, panicked. "Chicken! The cyclone chicken, please."  whew!  the decision had been made, and the world was still spinning. Just when i thought I had cleared the hurdle, the woman had the audacity to throw a curveball. "And would you like soup or salad?" Ahh, but I had prepared for this as I had heard the previous orders. a solid, confident "no, thank you." Now I was in. or so I thought. She bombarded me with options, "french fries, this or that, blah blah blah, or garlic mashed potatoes?" I grew tense, thoroughly unprepared for this surprise and verbal trap she had set. I honed in on the last words she said from my memory. "garlic Mashed potatoes" it was. I'd made it, but only to find out, I had tripped the security defenses and all my spy-buddies had died. The chicken? not so great. The potatoes? lack-luster (no offense to Outback Steakhouse, as I imagined their shrimp as exponentially more scrumptious). The only thing that saved me were the stolen mushrooms marinated in wine. Whoops. hehehee....... You see?! totally riveting. I know  I  was on the edge of my seat, well, more or less because the seats were pretty wide from the table. But yes, indeed, much of my life follows suit with this kind of slow fast-paced action. haha if this is all the action my life holds, I'm at least thankful it's not so much a comedy with me as the center joke. _Okay, gots to go. Physicals are tonight. wanna be in tip-top shape (XP). 50 push-ups, baby. Or else feel the wrath of the doctor's hand (>_
