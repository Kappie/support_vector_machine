If he could talk, I'm sure he'd say stuff like, "Whatever, Dad. You don't know what it's like to be me. You'll NEVER know what it's like to be me. You're not even a dog!" And he'd be right. He's also gotten more and more territorial as he's gotten older, growling or barking at people who may or may not be infringing on his territory. It's sort of cute, in a way.   Anyway, we were in the car today, and he was sitting on the passenger side, head out the window. We were stopped at a light, and a bus pulls up next to us with an ad on the side, like most of them have now. Teak immediately starts growling, which is pretty weird, because he usually just sort of hangs out and checks out the scenery while he's in the car. I look over at the ad, and it's for the St. Louis Zoo, and there's a big photograph of a polar bear from the neck up. Hilarious. He knew enough to identify the polar bear as an enemy, but not quite enough to realize that it was just a picture. Ahhh, kids.
