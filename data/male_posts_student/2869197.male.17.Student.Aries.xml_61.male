Do you hate me? are you Allied with Macintosh? Gah. Files of all the cards we cut werre sorted yesterday. Today, we took those and taped them onto paper for easy reading purposes. So much pain...so many files...  On lighter news, I bought a book at Urban Outfitters. Most of their books are...risque to say the least, the unholy bastard-children of postmodernism to say slightly more. But this one was only marginally directed towards sex and drugs. It is called The Modern Gentleman. A good read, if not one I suggest to my mother. It discusses the ways and acts of...well...the modern gentleman. How to host a parry, how to arrive at a party, the correct ways of a good skinny-dipping session (no joke). Those who know me know I am not quick to party or talk (or swim naked for that matter). But there is something in me that enjoys the idea of being a decent conversationalist. A quip, a quote, a quick limerick or crude and unexpected reference, something to add to the knowledge and general frivolity of whatever grouping dared to allow me in from the kind darkness of nonsociety.   We talked about kritiks today. While I'm still of the camp that sayeth kritiks are a little low for a negative to hit, I still like the idea behind them: philosophical foundations of a debate action are flawed. This brings in interesting and insightful thoughts by philosophers that I enjoy and soak in like warm rays of golden shine from our closest star. Not that Michigan ever gets that. Why is it still so cold?
