I had been debating whether or not to go to the party because of some inner drama between friends but at the last minute, I found out there was some miscommunication and I decided that I was not gonna miss out on it. I get there and it's boring at first but once the DJ got there, it popped off!! Now, I'm not the world's greatest dancer by any means and I'm usually shy on the dancefloor but there were so many people there and the music was sounding too good so I made my way to the floor and danced almost non-stop!! It was such a hyped atmosphere that I didn't care who saw me or who made jokes, I had fun!! And now I'm so tired and my feet are aching and I still have to study for my meeting tomorrow. But it was all worth it for those few hours of fun. Now off to studying and then I'm gonna throw on my headphones and fall asleep to Ms. Erykah Badu.       BTW, for those who don't know, she had a baby girl on July 5th. The father is still unknown but the name isn't; PUMA!!! U heard right, Puma, like the shoe. Now, Seven was a cool name when she named her son but Erykah got some 'splaining to do about Puma. ( and why didn't someone tell me how good Mama's Gun is? Y'all let me miss out for this long? You ain't right!!) - (and if anyone's actually reading this blog, gimme some kind of sign) : )        Current Ear-gasm----->Nina Sky -   "Move Your Body"
