What I'm here to tell you is that I'm going to try to be less of a weenie when it comes to stuff like this. I'm only 16 years old; I don't have the perspective or life history to make any meaningful statements about anything more serious than the brand of shampoo I use (I don't use shampoo, by the way; I just use soap on the hair).   I'll now use a cliched quote from  Citizen Kane  to sum up what I'm saying, making it look like I'm well read in film history when in reality the only Orson Welles/Alfred Hitchcock/Francis Ford Coppola/other golden age director movie I've seen is  Citizen Kane , which I blindly accept as the greatest movie ever made because other people say it is: "If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man." In other words, if I were a black orphan-drug dealer in inner-city Chicago, I'd be allowed to make haughty posts like the ones I made earlier, but since I'm not I just look arrogant and unsubstantial. Now I'll use French to heighten the arrogant effect: c'est la vie.  I'm sorry if I sounded overly thoughtful and meta-y. I'll try to tone down what I say so that my posts actually have meaning when read with the context of a spoiled teenager's life in mind. Maybe I'll try to emulate Sarah Vowell's writing style some more. Please note that this post is not in response to anything anyone has said to me.
