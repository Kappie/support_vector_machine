It was a statement made by the Israeli government, to the effect that they had a Hamas leader assassinated, in order to heighten the peace process.  Now, I don't pretend to understand the full intricacies of the situation between Israel and Palestine, I don't claim to know who is in the right, if anyone is, but I fail to see how killing another person, in an airstrike on their car, is going to enhance any sort of peace process. When you then hear that the Hamas group has vowed to retaliate 100 times over (i.e. by killing 100 Israelis) I think it is fair to say that the peace process has not been enhanced.  It seems to me that if there is to be any sort of peace, then both sides have to take a look at their commitment to the process. They both need to step back, say 'enough retaliation' and actually sort out their issues, without killing each other. I'm not so naive that I think it will happen instantly, but as long as government sanctioned murder takes place, it ain't gonna happen at all
