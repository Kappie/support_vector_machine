Disgustingly enough, I tend to think I'm better because I have not just morals, but  the  morals we are meant to live by. I firmly believe that following Christ is the path we are supposed to follow. I think that it's insane, however, to apply a Christian standard to people who believe differently. It's finally beginning to sink in how completely ridiculous and prideful I am. Hedonistic and atheistic people are not necessarily stupid because of what they do: as a matter of fact, based on their disbelief in God, it makes perfect sense to live the way they do. I would too if I didn't believe what I do. Think about it - if life really is meaningless, there is no life after death, and there is no divine accountability for our actions, why not fill your life with pleasure and excess? Why not do whatever you want? Of course, these types of people often fail to see future consequences for their actions if the effects are not immediately apparent. This isn't ignorant at all in most cases, because a lot of the time it appears to me as though such lifestyles go without extraordinary suffering. I'm no fortune teller, either. I can barely see past my own nose. So, although I believe these people are wrong in what they do, it is much more important to recognize that they are wrong in what they think. But what they think is logical based on their basic belief that there is no God. It is ridiculous for me to explain to them that what they are doing is wrong if they think the term is relative. When I'm dealing with an atheistic non-Christian, then, I must appeal to their reason, not their morality, and I must make a case for the existence of a Creator in the first place. Basically then, when I'm saying people are wrong for their beliefs, I should ignore that fact entirely and zero in on the origin of their mistaken yet proceedingly 'logical' beliefs. For clarity's sake, I shouldn't think of their secondary beliefs as right or wrong at all. It is of no consequence. It is only important for me to think them wrong on one count, and that is their disbelief in a Supreme Being. Everything else stems from that all-important fact. If someone grasps the enormity of that fact and they genuinely understand it as far as a human is capable of, then they will act on the truth. It is an irresistable force, the truth: once you know it, you  know  it, and you lose the ability not to do something with it. So for somebody to say, "I believe in God; I just don't care," means they don't  really  believe. He is irresistable and infinitely convicting, and if you know him you cannot help but love him, and if you love him you cannot help but do what he says. Above all, you cannot cease to know him. The truth can be masked by lies, but it can never be destroyed by them. Once you know the truth, you cannot unknow it. You may convince yourself otherwise for a time, but it will find you again.
