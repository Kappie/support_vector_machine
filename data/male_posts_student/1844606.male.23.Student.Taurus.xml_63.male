I've been looking forward to this next semesters writing because its one on one with a professor of your choosing.  Or so I thought  Due to budget cuts (wow there's a shocker) and more students than usual, and less teachers, not everyone gets to take this final Rhet class.  Which means in order to finish out my degree I might have to take an intro to poetry class.    Not only do I NOT want to write poetry, I also don't want to have to put up with sappy "poetry" about chicks and their boyfriends, or emo boys about girls.  If I thought short story classes were brutal, I have a feeling this thing will be above and beyond.  Plus, I've saved up three or four stories that I've always wanted to work on, but saved them for a time when I can spend a lot of time crafting them, and not having everyone in my class look at it.  Now it seems that chance maybe gone.  True enough, I can still write the stories, but I don't get credit for them in school and I doubt that they'd get published.  God I love going to a public University
