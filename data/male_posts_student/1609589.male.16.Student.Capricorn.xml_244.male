Mall monkeys was a webcomic about people that hung out in the mall all the time, and even though they did make fun of hot topic, they never said they were bad. This proves that Hot Topic are evil bastards that should be killed. They are taking legal action against him for slander.  And, this is the most sickening part of it- on the Hot Topic main page, there is a circle in the main graphic that says "say anything." Obviously they're just a corrupt company with CEOs and lawyers that dont even understand what Say Anything means.  I never even liked hot topic. It's for posers.  On another topic, Time fucking sucks. I couldn't get to school on time today, and my teacher made me STAND UP for 2 hours. It's a stupid punishment, but standing up wasnt the worst problem- its that I got in trouble for not getting to school at 7:35. That time is ridiculous. (Cesar made fun of me for saying Ridiculous, and I don't even know why, because if anything, he should go kill himself because he doesn't know what ridiculous means. He's an idiot. Sorry for speaking english, you fucking bitch-fuck. Would you rather ME say "That's fucking crunk, bitch!"? Huh? Would ya? I hope you die.)  Mr. Reyes heard me talking about how stoopid having to stand up was and i swear he was almost gonna get mad. At ME. I've never been late before, I have the right to talk.  Adam and I are gonna hack time so we get 36 hour days. That would be better. And, as a side project, we're also gonna make it to instead of sleeping, we just plug ourselves in at night. It'll feel better than sleeping, too. Our ideas rule, even though this is one of the ones ive ever had that can't be done.  Here's an idea that can be done though.  It's a way to keep illegal immigrants out of the US.  Ready for this?  Flaming river of gas.  I said it. It would totally work, too. It would extend all the way around the U.S.  First, it would need to be built, which will create jobs for people in construction(ditch-diggers 200 fold), and gas manufacturing.  Then, once it was done, we would turn it on and people in Mexico and Canada(and ESPECIALLY.... Well, never mind) would be scared to come, too.  If I were in charge, we'd have some fun, too. We'd turn it off at random intervals, tricking the immigrants to think that it may be safe to come over. But then... BAM we turn it back on again! Ha ha! They would burn, and we would laugh! At least I would laugh.
