But, after about 15 minutes of rain (so far), The River still stands.  So, basically, we got a free day off of school for this whole thing; nothing more, nothing less.  The hurricane turned out to be a category 4 storm, but, also headed towards the Orlando direction.  Oh well.  Happy Friday the 13th everyone!  Now I have to get everything back to its normal position.  I literally had to move everything into my closet, because the hurricane was scheduled to hit The River dead on sometime today.  All of my stuff is packed away.  We were going to head north to somewhere like, Tallahassee, but, we got 15 minutes of rain.  So we didn't leave.  And, unless that thing makes another turn and decides to hit The River later on, we're staying here.  So, tomorrow, we will resume normal blogging schedule.   Well, it's been an incredibly long day...I didn't get to sleep in on my day off because of the stupid spooty evacation, and my mom flipping out about having to get ready to leave.  But, I guess it was a good idea to be prepared.  I don't think I'll ever get to experience a hurricane, which is perfectly okay with me, but, after seeing what happened in Port Charlotte today after the power came back, I guess being prepared is a good idea.  I'm going to go to sleep early tonight, so don't expect anything more.   This has been my 100th post on Blog of Bagel.  Happy Friday the 13th.
