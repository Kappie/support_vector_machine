Spent the morning at mass at the Holy Rosary Church in Angeles and then had lunch with Mrs. Palo and her daughters and mostly answered questions about life in the U.S.    After lunch I was dropped back off at Mr. Feliciano's house and just contemplated/meditated (medicated? lol!) about nothing in general. Sounds very zen I think since I was contemplating 'nothingness' lol.  I suppose it shouldn't be so odd since I consider myself a Taoist by philosophy and a Roman Catholic by religion although I think my views on religion are very progressive and would probably raise a few eyes at the least.    Anyways, a nice quiet day for self reflection and contemplation. Tomorrow is the big hike to Pilien.
