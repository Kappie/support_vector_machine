He was suprised when I told him we already near his home, we don't tell him before hand. We have lunch at Jaya Jusco Taman Universiti. Bought some apparels and a new wallet at Body Glove shop. Good price, cheaper than the last time at Langkawi.      Madihah  Munir       Lunch at Jaya Jusco   Back at  my uncle's house we have some discussion regarding custom made software for his law firm. I personally recommends Hamid Misnan to code the software. At dusk we are back in Pagoh. Uncle Lu was already home,  then came Azreen and his girlfriend to pick up his two sisters. My Grandma's home is still under renovation, I hope it will complete soon to avoid further inconveniences.
