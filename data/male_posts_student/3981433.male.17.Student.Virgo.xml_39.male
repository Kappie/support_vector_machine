Lost Prophets rock - listen to their 1st album on the train up to southminster - went quite quickly actually...  managed to find my way through southminster to the magical house of Gem and meet charli and gemma. we all just talked about random stuff and sat on Gems cool GMTV sofa - really comfy! then everyone layed in my arms and i felt really happy - just laying there with two really good friends.  so we discussed the disneyland details - its all sorted and i should be getting the money this saturday if all goes to plan...  charli is obsessed with the gay guy - Paul. lol why is she so hung up on him? he might be her best friend but hes gay lol....and charli decided to tell me about one of his anal sex exploits...very nasty.  i'm so looking forward to disneyland its untrue - i think its probably because Gema dn Charli are really good friends and we all get on so well....  i dunno i'm shattered - i'm off to bed
