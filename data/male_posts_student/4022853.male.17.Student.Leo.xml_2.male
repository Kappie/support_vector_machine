The dream I had though, it was terrible.    My best friend was being buried alive; I was running from people who wanted to kill me, monsters killing other monsters.    I won’t read into it too much.    I was sick today so I’m not too worried.    Staring at my ceiling I start to thinking about a lot of things.    Really at the moment I’m broken hearted.    I’ll get over it, its just this would be the 3 rd  time I’m doing this because of the same girl.    We haven’t even called it off, we just haven’t talked.    It’s complicated, as things always are.    Sometimes I wish I was an animal and not a person.    Animals just live their simple lives surviving while humans do the same but by no means is it simple.    We complicate things by creating all these amusement.    We go to work, make money, and after that we come home looking for entertainment.    These industries and corporations just prey on us like we we’re savage pack of dogs wanting fresh meat.    This analogy isn’t too far from the truth.    We go to war and kill each other almost everyday.    Some of humanity or almost all of it just sickening. We kill each other, animals, take away life everyday, pollute this earth to the point where it become uninhabitable.    We multiply at rate unheard of, like a disease almost.    My sour view towards humanity grows everyday.    I don’t like what I am.    Then there are things about being human that makes up for all of that.    Love. Unfortunately my love chose to ignore me.             Isn’t life just grand?
