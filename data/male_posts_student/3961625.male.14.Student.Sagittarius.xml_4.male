We parked under the same bridge we met Nancy under 2 years ago, walked a short distance to the tram stop, from which we took tram #22 to Vogelmart station, from which we walked a little to a market.  There I spent €18.00 on ------- for Liah, €5.00 on an --- for Dale, and €15.00 on a ------- for Dale.  Then we walked up to the Belfry.  Next to it they were towing cars.  We paid €0.50 each to climb up a roundtrip 868 steps to the top of the tallest tower in Gent.  Oh, it was so beautiful....  Then we came down, at a lunch of Lasanga (for me) and walked on... we saw witches, guns, rides, canals, castles, and all manner of other things.  Oh, and I spent €15.00 on a ----- for Mimi.  We saw a show for Polè Polè and saw a really wierd street theater.... I have pictures.  And that was my day.  BTW: Adrian, u lazy bum; why aren´t you commenting or posting?
