I bought a trombone duet book from the stalls and had a sandwich. We drove back, I went to Les Mis and we did the barricades and such... and I'll tell you something... hugging, holding, and singing to someone is made so much harder when they aren't there. We did A Heart Full of Love as well, and that was fun. I don't know how much physical contact N'omi (Cosette) is going to mind, cause I always envisiged the last note being sung with both singers in each others arms, and it slowly working up from clasping hands to that... I've also got to consult with Susie, who's doing Fantine, how much contact SHE minds for the Docks scene. I've got to molest her somehow, I don't know. What I'm doing at the moment is circling her and eyeing her up, and I touch her a couple of times. I don't know, truth is given to us all in our time, in our turn.  Also had NJAN practice. That was a bit of a waste of time without Tobin, it felt wrong. So instead we went through a few things then phaffed about for the rest of it. Like Tom said, it's like trying to play the drums when you've lost one of the sticks.  Libby hasn't been on, I'm actually enjoying talking to her. She's quite cool, and the fact she's going out with Tobin is actually a plus for me because it means that I don't get that paranoid thing that she thinks I'm hitting on her. Because if she thinks I'm hitting on her she cwaazy. Yeah, she's good looking and all, but she's also Tobin's property.  Stay safe, LFZ.  Quote of the day: "In my life she has burst like the music of angels, The light of the sun. And my life seems to stop as if something is over, And something has scarcely begun."
