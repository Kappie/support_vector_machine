No matter; I ate a bowl and a half of Cheerios that tasted surprisingly good considering they had been open for at least three weeks.    I was in a complete daze during my first class at church - America's Christian Heritage. The topic was Christianity during the Civil War, and while I found most of it interesting, I zoned in and out a lot. Lots of blank staring at various inanimate objects. I was a bit more alert during the college/20's class though.    After I got home, I took a 3.5 hr nap, then got up around 5:45 to go to the Acropolis with the fam. I must admit that I was again in a daze for this outing, and not very hungry.Being out on the east side of the Ville further crystallized my desire to not be here, but to return to HK. Although I love the U.S., andenjoy seeing friends and family again, what I was doing in China just seemed more meaningful than what goes on here. C'est la vis (sp?)   Over the next week or so, I intend to construct a detailed report about my mission trip to Hong Kong and China. As I didn't take notes or journal while I was there, the entirepiece will be constructed from my memory, and it may be a week before anything is posted. For those on my support team, I will be sending a letter and postcard to you with general details about the trip, but the more specific info will be found here. I apologize for not sending postcards from HK as I intended; let's just say that doing so was not as convenient as I thought it would be. Stay tuned.
