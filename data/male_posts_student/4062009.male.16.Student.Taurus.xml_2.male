Now do take note that school has not started yet but it shall soon, so my Round Ups will not really be exciting because of it. But once school starts, then the fun begins because you shall see me complain a lot! LOL!  Well what happened this week. Nothing much I have to say that it was just a normal boring week. Dad went to court Wednesday, his divorce hearing.Mom and dad went to the mall on a few counts to look for some shoes that"mom" (My dad has hooked up with someone he knew a long time ago. The wife he is divorcing never showed affection to him so I can understand whyso soon.)can wear. Can you believe that these pair of tennies that she got is her first pair ever! I am truely shocked by that, I must say.  Anyway, they went shopping and they got what they want. Me, I did pretty much nothing by just staying home and watching movies; working on the computer and things like that. And because of all that time on the computer I have managed to get my pulse on WhatPulse up to 58,000+ keystrokes. Woot for me! :D  Also over this great week I have gotten two comments on my articles. Yeah! My first ever two comments. And I shall address those comments here and right now. LOL!  "   urlLink Corwin Silvermage  said...  Wolfwood, as in Nicholas Wolfwood from Trigun, Eh? Good anime." Thats right Corwin, I got my name from the anime. I love Trigun, in fact I bought that $200 DVD collection of it because I like it so much. I know, I'm crazy! LOL!  " urlLink firequall  said...  logical thinking and it makes sense. good deducting!" Why think you firequall. I am glad you agree withwhat I believe in when it comes to life and sex.   Isn't that cool or what! LOL!  Last but not least of my week I have posted two poems that some of you poetry lovers might like. Just scrool down the page to "in this world i live" and "work of art" to read them. Enjoy!  That concludes the weekly round up ladies and gents. Talk to you all later! Cya!     Wolfwood
