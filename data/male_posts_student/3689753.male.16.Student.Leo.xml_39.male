Throughout this long trek many things have come to pass.  In the woods we have sampled squirrel, snake and trout.  We have gone without showers, some elected to use the 5 degree waterfall, but the rest of us held out.  More stories will be posted as time goes on but the most important thing is that all the research got done and our trip was a major success.  We would like to thank everybody that made this possible including our corporate sponsor, Accuweather.
