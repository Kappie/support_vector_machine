WRONG! i don't get presents on UC (Ukrainian Christmas) all i get is a big meal with no meat in it, but hey that part of it isn't so bad. it's the whole family thing, 30 people at one table, saying some prayers in a language i dont care to know. and also if you've ever been in a house full of 30 Ukrainians who are all traditional, and you're the one who is the black sheep and is different from EEEEEveryone else, you'd understand my situation better. but that's not even the worst part, UC carrolers! the absolute most horrible thing known to man, these people i swear have mastered the art of imitating the sound of a cat that's being beaten. it's horrible, and every time someone new comes that isn't Ukrainian, we have to warn them to avoid any...complications. so basically we all just try to sit there and smile to pretend that we like the singing just to placate my great aunt who would kill us if she caught us making fun of it. Never by your own free choice should you listen to UC carrols. i warn you all, stay away! -Matt
