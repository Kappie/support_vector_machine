He has been sleeping for much of this Tuesday night.  During the day he really wasn't tired though.  Pretty awake in fact.  Classes were pretty stupid and useless but they had their moments.  All in all school is a waste for Tyke now.  His math teacher talked to him about his last test and it was normal for the entire class but she was just saying how he should come in and get help and Tyke just said, "Yeah, maybe."  Then she said that he really should and asked him if he would so he replied again with, "Yeah, maybe."  She finally took the hint though that Tyke is definitely not coming in.  The worst part of today was just having to drag himself from class to class.  Lunch was great.  They went to JIB and took Tyke's brother's car.  Dr. Phil and Amed liked the ride and of course the music.  Dr. Phil surprised Tyke with the fact that he was not against any of the songs that Tyke played.  So the rest of the week will be filled with sweet tunes and a sweet ride.  Sweet.  Tyke played more ESPN after school and that was fun.  But he got really sleepy doing so.  He basically fell asleep after playing.  Then woke up and watched some of the FLAM-LEHIGH game on ESPN.  Then he had dinner.  Then he fell asleep again.  Then he woke up and got online a little.  Then he just sat there.  And sat.  And almost fell asleep.  Then woke up from his daze.  Then kept sitting.  And finally decided to do a half-ass blog to keep him awake.  And it has worked.  But it isn't interesting so it is time to call it quits.  Good luck with stuff.
