I was sick so I took a nap and watched the last few minutes of the KU-TX game (great game by the way).  Then headd over to Quinons and had like 2 beers, stayed sober.  There were some drunk fools there though.  One of my Bro's little sister's came around trying to collect money for the keg or something and offfered to take her shirt of for 7$.  Then went on about how she wasn't a cheap whore and wouldn't get anyone a (free) beer from the bar but would flash her tits for 7$.  Then proceeded to go and puke in the bathroom.  Then Nate and his ex got in a big fight.  Then I get a call from sieckman about how JP just got arrested for running over the Airconditioning units outside their apt.  He went and got an OUI and I guess blew a .228.  What a drunk..  I went over and checked out the damage then came home and went to sleep...  What a crazy night..
