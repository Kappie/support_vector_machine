Finally started using "ettercap" as a serious tool instead of something to piss about with schweet, Also turns out i shall be doing VB next year :( no colleges/6 forms/schools in my local area offer anything else so im going to be left to develop C/C++ at home meh and I shall see myself using C/C++ more as even tho it is crossplatform tis used quite a bit in *nix so meh ah well allways need some windows programming and maybe ill take on assembly but that can be next years challange.
