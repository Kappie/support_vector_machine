During the day he got up, did nothing for a while, then played the piano for a while cuz it's fun. Then he watered some plants in the blistering heat. Or at least the hotness that was outside. Tyke just started to wonder when the last time there was an entire day when nobody other than Tyke went to Tyke's website. Could be a while...or it could be today. Who really knows? Not a soul. Except maybe Al Gore, cuz he invented the internet. Speaking of Al Gore, Tyke has watched I Love the 90s on VH1 like 10-15 times this past week. It's on all the time so he just tunes in and lets it play while he either watches it or does something else downstairs. Either way it's still on. Tyke got a call from Macaroon during the day and they were joined by Dr. Phil at Tyke's house in the afternoon. They played some cards (not poker though) and then a game of Risk where Macaroon definitely got "touched" by Dr. Phil. Definitely. But Tyke lost too so in the end the Asians managed to rule the world. Tonight involved a great dinner at Subway. It sure did taste great. When Dr. Phil left for his 5 hour work shift (almost typed shit instead, that woulda been funny) Tyke and Macaroon went to the tent sale at GI Joes for about 3 minutes before departing to their separate homes. Tyke watched a few programs on the tele before meeting up with Macaroon and then going over to the house that Tyke played poker at on Wednesday. K-caj and his friend played again. Tyke didn't have any luck today though. He lost 15 and even when he got a decent hand he wouldn't win it. He won some pots but not ones that mattered that much. Macaroon however was catching great cards and had great hole cards. So he ended up winning quite a bit. But Tyke ate a donut before he left and that tasted good. Then he took the supposedly sick Macaroon and came home. Then he wrote another email to Kinker and put on some more Dashboard Confessional. He's had another DC rebirth. Listening to lots of songs. It's just so cool. Maybe Tyke will actually turn his computer off tonight. He hasn't since he got back from Europe. That's almost 2 weeks. Hmmm...it could be time.
