      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn. Tampa bay sucks. Calgary rules. See, I'm no fair-weather fan. Speaking of which, it is raining, and on the way from my chem lab to the computer lab I decided that instead of walking about 10 feet on pavement I would cut across some mud, and just be really careful. Of course I slipped, but only enough to cover about six inches of the bottom of my jeans in mud. Drat. I need to come up with some more poetry club fliers, but I'm blanking right now, plus it's still raining. Once again I have managed to start a post when I don't actually have anything to post about. This friend of mine runs local poetry night here in Tallahassee every Tuesday at Brother's a gay bar. It's not gay poetry night or anything, just anybody who can read. After running the gamut of every other one of my writing friends he has finally managed to ask me to go, although deep down inside I don't want to go. The main reason is that it starts at 11 o'clock, and the crowd is supposed to be harsh, especially on those who aren't gay. Meh, any exposure is good exposure, I guess.  Glenn
