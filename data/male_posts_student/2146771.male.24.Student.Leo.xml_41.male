I just got out of the shower and it's NOON!!  It's like my only day off ever!  I need to work on my video editing... but we have Mattathias's birthday today too.  So Brooke is making us some freedom toast(HA), and then we're going grocery shopping if anything is open.  I'm going to go now so I can look up how to make french toast... BYE BYE
