"Go love someone Else.", he said.I will. Being that you want to forget me and me to forget you, yes i will try to do that. Everything that was happy ends here and now. After tonight, my life will change forever. I will now be the usual me, LoNeR. With no one else to turn to but Daniel, a really good friend whom have been by my side from the darkest moments of my life. Thank you Daniel. I would like to wish him all the best with his piano exams. Hopefully we will meet again soon this Saturday for your concert.Well its time for me to move on with life. Start back from Birth and ends at Death. Dreams of being the best gymnast, chef, singer, musician(tuba), artist, actor, dancer and partner (to someone) will never be shattered, holding my self together and holding my head up high is what i am going to do. Proud in being Gay! I got Pride in being GAY!. I am a Gay Boy! Thank you to all my friends who have supported me and cared for me while i was down or in trouble. Well till here.   Rest in Peace my dear Ashden and may god bring you to heaven. Ashden - Birth Date :1 - 12 - 03 (time 12mid night)  - Death Date : 20 - 7 - 03 (time 12mid night.)
