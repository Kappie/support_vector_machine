Read a few blogs and a post of "Love in friendships" on the canadian forums, before I decided that its time for me to do my post for the day.  Actually woke up at 7.10 am, but due to the tired me (only 6 hours of sleep beforehand), I decided to stay in bed for a while before I get prepped up and go for my chemistry remedial. But alas. I got into a semi-conscious state until 8.30, that was then I suddenly remembered that I had something on ! So I rushed up, did my stuff in a hurry, and left the house hurriedly, taking bus $2.40 to school. Reached there at 9.15, in quite a good time since they just started the lesson. Whew.  So I took a seat, and did what I'm supposed to do (duh) and the whole class was kinda quiet. I liked it, since, normal lessons would consist of those who werent interested to learn, so they made a din at the back. Worse, I'm now sitting at the back of the class. Today's atmosphere was a quiet and serious one, with a few jokes of mis-pronounciation of some terms by Louis. Besides that I could concentrate pretty well. Thats how a class should be.  Chemistry remedial ended, I decided that I make a move rather than stay for the Maths one.. since I cant really understand what Mr Koh's trying to say, as well as his sudden mood swings. He will just go nuts, scolding the whole class. Once I tried to clear a doubt I had with a problem, he was in a foul mood, so I got scolded for nothing, and the whole class looked at me.  Went with Sherman to Atrium, played a bit of ID, where he got cut into pieces by a Cappuccino because he mis-judged the level of the player. Sigh. And he played wet with a FR. Nice.... laming him. Got my Nokia 6230 warranty card stamped, and headed to PS for a round of WMMT. Took the train to Chinatown while Sherman would be alighting at Outram.. since hes having tuition at Holland Village. Met Heron while going up the escalator. What coincidence.  Went to Mac. Had McWings meal, and talked a bit with Heron. Didnt study as was supposed to. But well... Someone in the team is obviously getting out of hand, and its gonna explode like a time bomb sooner or later. Kicking him out is the best I say.  Stayed at CTP till around 7.15pm, had dinner with Yap, Ivan and Steve, and headed back home. Got a new pack of Neutrogena (Mines running empty soon).  Bathed, and decided to come online to look around. Found this interesting topic, Love in friendships. Saw that he was actually friends with a girl for some time.. but all along, the girl treated him like a cushion whenever she fell, and when shes lonely. How should I put this.... The guy was there for her all of the time, but heck, she didnt even take much notice of it, except saying that hes the best. AND yet finding other boyfriends, when a good choice is just beside her. Kinda unfair for the guy who worked hard for his special spot in that girl... Being close friends, and yet, the girl didnt want to progress further with him, even though hints were dropped time and again. Even confessions. The girl just looked out the window, when theres already someone in the house. Dumb, blind, whatever. And the guy hooked her up with one of his best friends, and whom the girl had a crush on. Became a love triangle, with a line missing.  Emotions well up me as I read through this, as well as some other peeps' love story.. Helping out others, doing good, at the expense of your own happiness. Or simply, sacrificing something important, just to do some good, and the bad outcomes, taking the blow yourself. While the other person enjoys the good result of it. The nice guy gets the lousy end of the stick of it all, despite the (noble) sacrifices he made.  Well I feel that I'm also like the "I'll do good deeds even if it brings me down" type, the emotional "doormat" for the people, letting them get comfy after letting their stuff out, and doing my best to try to console them. Then they treat you like normal friends, not giving much concern to you. When something bad happens again, its a vicious cycle repeating itself again. And they never see you in a romantic way, because it all boils down to looks, despite all the crap they all say. So much for having a good character and all. Brave fronts and happy outlook ? Hahaha. Tell me its really like that.  I do all this hoping that someone someday, will notice the hard work you try to put in to other people's lifes, brighten it up for them, and that someone will appreciate you doing all this. But somehow this somewhat never happens, and even if it does, its just a microscopic chance. Maybe one in a trillion ? Makes no sense, and probably never will. Ah, love.  I dont expect a good reward for everything nice I do, but hey, at least something nice should happen even if its once in a blue blue moon ? Just a little gift for all that arduous work you've done.. I think its more than reasonable for even that to take place.. Just once. I dont ask for much. I'll cherish it, I swear.  Nice guys finish LAST. I second that. Whats so nice about my character being good and all of that crap ? All that proper chivalry ? I just dont get it. Twisted sick ideology ? Maybe. From end of June till now, I've been stuck in a storm, when the rain just seems to let down for a while, it starts a new wave of tides, and the weather makes a turn for the worst, again. All I can do now is to wait it out, and hope that theres a rainbow at the other end of the horizon. All I wanna do is to make someone happy... Is that too hard for me to do ? Jeez.  Food for thought tonight, as I sleep with all these in my mind. Might be kept awake, even though I've been out all day, and I'm totally shacked out.  Good night peeps. Hope my running nose stops its nonsense, because I'm really not liking it. Not at all.
