On this thing I actually have to go to blogger.com, log in, click the little new post thing, and THEN I get to write it. Could they have made it any harder? I don't think so.  Atleast they aren't password nazis like livejournal. That fucking place, FUCK.  I tried about 10 different passwords.  And a word that's a brand name it said is in the dictionary.  NO IT'S FUCKING NOT.  Livejournal...god I'm glad that's over.  Emo-land, I'm done with you.  Now that I have a blog, I can post more serious things, like this post.      While I'm on the topic of things that suck.  The game battlefield vietnam and thier latest "patch"  Oh god, it's so great.  It fixed all the things that weren't broken and added new.  Mobile spawns don't work, the wonderful sound of the nalpalm bomb repeating the entire time the first time one was dropped by you.  And the extra lag and worse performance, it's so fucking great, I love EA Games!      Hmm, that's about it.  Livejournal sucks, ea games sucks, I'm a cynical bastard.  Yep, bout covered my day so far.  Later      -Robert      01001111 01001101 01000110 01000111 00100000 01000010 01001001 01001110 01000001 01010010 01011001
