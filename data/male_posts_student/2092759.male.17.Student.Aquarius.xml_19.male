I need to get my merit badges done..... But im not going to do it tonight. Rambleing is always good.   For anyone who hasnt seen it yet, heres the beginning of a screenplay im working on for a film I want to make with friends of mine in Media Tech.  THE COMIC SHOP A screenplay by William French  Character List Luke Miller- A single white male, Age 24. Luke is the archtypical comic book nerd. He owns his own comic book store, Comics N' Stuff, the local den of pronounced nerdom. While single he is becoming increasingly envolved with one of the few females that enter the store for any reason other then asking where the tatoo parlor is, Alice. Luke is the proud owner of the original prop lightsaber used by David Prowse in his role as Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Armed with a razor sharp wit and a deep abiding hatred for Star Trek and Archie Comics, Luke  runs afoul trekkies and angry parents with nothing better to do then berate his managment abilities.   George Nelson- A single white male, Age 24. George is Luke's fifth appendage. Best friends since the third grade when they got into a spirited debate about how the Twin Ion Engine of a TIE Fighter works, George and Luke have been esentially inseperable since then. His ability to retain useless information concerning to pointless topics has made George a god amongst nerd, createing a sagelike following around him. It has been said that George has watched the Original Star Wars trilogy, Lord of The Rings, and The Matrix Trilogy more often then any man on the planet (with the possible exception of Luke.) George compensates for this amazing talent by owning The Imperial Ink, a tatoo parlor next door to Comics N' Stuff, ergo surrounding himself in beutiful women.  Hal Bengier- The Canadian. A bit slow on the uptake because of extensive use of ganga, Hal is none the less well meaning. Obstenant and closed minded, argueing with Hal is like bludgeoning your head against a brick wall. All it does is produce a pissed off person and a non-the-less unchanged wall. He is the friend that everyone loves but at the same time hates with a passion.  Toby Quesada- The Prodigy. Though Toby is only sixteen years old he has already showed massive potential. Having memorized the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook, Toby is a force to be reackoned with. Passive-Agressive, Toby has a very biting, some times annoying wit that strikes like a tiger when his is angered. Toby has a Napolean complex that defys description. Though a good kid he contains the vanity and festering anger that is reminisant of a young Anakin. As George is well known to say "The Force is strong with this one."  Milton Moore- The Voice. A disembodied voice. Though Milton basically lives in Comics N' Stuff, he is never quite in view. Weither he is locked in the bathroom, hidden behind rows and rows of comic books, sleeping underneath the table or the counter, Milton is the concience of the perverted dwellers of the store.   Mark Tyler- The noob. Still in middle school, at 13 Mark is the youngest of our characters, both in age and ability. He loves DC Comics. He only plays Green in Magic. He spends five minutes gathering Minerals and Vespin Gas. Hell hath no demon more foul or imp more annoying than a noob, and Mark is a noob's noob.  The Trekkie- Evil. Pure unadaltureated, evil. He worships at the alter of Shatner and must be destroyed.   Alice Morgan- A 23 year old Art Major at UCLA, Alice is the only thing without a penis that intentionaly comes into the store thats not looking for a late bill. Quiet and kind, Alice is a gifted artist who has a quasi-silent crush on Luke. Bright Red hair and a collection of Jhonen Vasquez  comics are her signatures. Foul mouthed and sharpminded, Alice is more then an intellectual match for any of the stores inhabitants. Plus she has a secret weapon: Boobs.  Frank- Known only as Frank, he owns The Negative Zone, the wholesale nerd Mecca where Luke purchases his product from. If any rare memorobillia comes onto the market, its as sure as shooting Womp Rats in Beggers canyon with a proton torpedo that hes heard about it.    Face shot of Luke's face at ground level with the bed. he faces the camera, with a dazed and confused look on his face. Freeze Frame.  *Voiceover* 	LUKE: My name is Lucas Miller. I was born in a movie theater in southern California on May 21st, 			1980, during the first screening of "The Empire Strikes Back."  Zoom to the Edwards marquee with "The Empire Strikes Back" up in lights.  Inside the theater pan from left to right. Stop at Mary and Blake. Cloud City appears on the screen, while Mary's face becomes construed. Her water breaks and Blake reaches to help her.   		BLAKE: Holy Shit! Ok honey, stay calm and just breath.  		MARY: *Lamaze breathing*  Luke finally arives in the world, angled over Blake's shoulder, looking at Mary's face. She's crying and smiling, baby is raised into view. Cuts to theater screen with Vader.  		VADER: Luke, I am your father.  Baby Luke wails his head off. Pan from Vader into store. Title fades into screen and then back out. Pull back from TV untill the Camera is positioned looking inward from the door towards the couch, with Luke, Hal, Toby and Mark sitting watching "The Empire Strikes Back."  Close up of Toby, tight around the face.  		Toby: Vader single handedly killed hundreds of thousands of Jedi, perhaps the most    powerful beings in the universe.   Freeze Frame.  *voiceover*	LUKE: This is Toby Quesada. Toby is a bit of a prodigy. For being 16 he's one smart mother fucker. He built a Nuclear reactor out of the motor from a 1984 Cutlass and a Microwave. Though no relation to the editor and chief of Marvel Comics, he did meet him at Comicon last year.  Impressed him so much he got him to sell and sign him an original copy of Guardian Devil. 	  Cut to close up of Hal, again, tight around the face.  		HAL: But... Luke owns his ass at the end of Jedi!  Freeze Frame  *voiceover*	LUKE: This is Hal Bengier. Everyone has a Hal in their group. The guy who smoked a little too much weed in High School so now he cant make a valid point if his life depends apon it, yet is so fucking obstinant that the arguments never end. Weve been friends since the seventh grade, but I swear to god, Half the time I want to throw his ass over the railing. 	  Cut to close up of Luke.  		LUKE: Yea, but thats because he gave up and threw the Emperor into the heart of the Death Star! If he hadnt pussied out, Vader could fuck Luke's little bitch Jedi-wannabe ass up.  Zoom to a shot of the Bathroom door.  		MILTON: Are you watching the movie? Vader cuts Luke's fucking hand off and sends it flying to oblivion. He lets his own fucking kid fall to his presumed death. Vader would win, end of story. Not even in the same ballpark.  *voiceover* 	LUKE: This ambigious voice is that of Milton J. Moore. In five years of owning this shop, most have never seen Milton. He is kind of the stores unofficial mascot. He's here from opening to closeing everyday, asleep under the tables, moving amongst the racks, and generaly hidden from view, if not from mind.  Cut back to the four guys sitting on the couch looking towards Hal.  		HAL: None of you have given me one good reason why Vader would win.  		LUKE: I only need one and its right there.  *Points towards the counter*  Shot of the lightsaber in its case above the counter. Zoom in and as the camera gets in closer the light around the lightsaber becomes increaseingly intense.  *voiceover*	Luke: The original prop Lightsaber used by David Prowse in his role as Darth Vader in the single best movie ever made, The Empire Strikes Back. Entrusted to me on my Eighteenth birthday, my parents saved money for three years and travled to every swap meet and trade show on the west coast trying to find me this Holy Grail of Nerdom.  *Bell rings* Cut to shot of bell ringing as the door opens.  Cut to The Trekkie walking into the store in in full Federation Captains uniform, with a phaser at his side. He gives the store a once over.  Cut to the guys on the couch. They slowly turn their heads. The Trekkie's eyes lock with Luke's. *OK corral music* The gang stands and reaches for their lightsabers. Trekkie reaches for his phaser. The gang draws their lightsabers, making the *fhum* humming sound. Close up of trekkie's eyes, sweat dripping from the brow. Eyes move franticly, counting the Jedi. Deciding hes been out numbered the Trekkie bolts for the door.  		TREKKIE: Whoopwopwopwopwopwowop.  The Jedi turn. Fade to black.  Cut to the guys sitting a table in the back of the store. D paraphanallia is strewn across the table, as well as drinks and food. Milton is in the storage room scroungeing for food.  		LUKE: Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room. The pungent stench of mildew eminates from the wet dungeon walls. 		MILTON: Where are the Cheetos! 		LUKE: Theyre right next to you. 		MARK: I cast a spell. 		MILTON: Wheres the Mountain Dew! 		LUKE: In the fridge, duh! 		MARK: I wanna cast a spell!  		MILTON: Can I have a Mountain Dew? 		LUKE: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew, just go	get it! 		MARK: I can cast any of these right, on the list? 		LUKE: Yes, any of the first level ones. 		MILTON: Im goona get a soda, anone want one? Hey Luke, im not in the room right? 		LUKE: What room? 		MARK: I wanna cast Magic Missile. 		MILTON: The room where hes casting all thesespells from. 		LUKE: He hasnt cast anything yet. 		MARK: I am though, if youd listen. I casting Magic Missile! 		LUKE: What are you casting Magic Missile? Theres	nothing to attack here. 		MARK: I... Im.. I'm attacking the darkness!  Loud, Nerdy laugthter erupts from the group.  		LUKE: Fine, fine, you attack the darkness. Theres an elf in front of you. 		HAL: Whoa, thats me right? 		LUKE: Hes wearing a brown tunic, and he has grey hair and blue eyes. 		HAL: No, I dont. I have grey eyes. 		LUKE: Let me see that sheet. 		HAL: Well, it says I have Blue, but I decided I wanted Grey eyes. 		LUKE: Whatever. Ok, you guys can talk to each other now, if you want.  		MARK: Hello. 		HAL: Hello. 		MARK: I am Galstaff, sorcerere of Light! 		HAL: Then whyd you have to cast Magic Missile?  Loud, nerdy laughter erupts from the group.  		LUKE: You, you, you guys are being attacked. 		MILTON: Do I see that happening?! 		LUKE: No, your outside by the tavern. 		MILTON: Cool, I get drunk! 		LUKE: There are seven Ogres surrounding you. 		HAL: How did they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Faithful Hound cast.	 		LUKE: No you didnt. 		MILTON: Im getting drunk. Are there any girls there? 		HAL: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Hound. 		LUKE: But you never actually cast it! 		MILTON: Roll the dice to see if im getting drunk! 		LUKE: *sigh and rolls dice* You are! 		MILTON: Are there any girls there? 		LUKE: Yea! 		HAL: I did though, I completely said when you first asked me.  Interupts him	LUKE: No you didnt, you never actually said you were casting the spell. So now theres Ogres ok? 		MILTON: Ogres? Man, I got a Ogre-slaying knife. Its got a +9 against Ogres. 		LUKE: Your not there, your in the bar getting drunk! 		MILTON: Ok, but if there are any girls there I wanna do them!    Thats it for right now. I know most of the jokes are esoteric and a wee bit nerdy, but trust me, if you undertsand it its fucking hilarious.
