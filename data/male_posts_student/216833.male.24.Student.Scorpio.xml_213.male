Besides that, I went to breakfast with Brenden and we chow'd down on some spuds. You could tale by the look on our face that we both hate our job as of now. Even more so than before, I think. In my case anyways.  Luckily, I did get a call from Legacy, and I have a real face to face interview on Friday 17th. Slow going, but good news non the less. Talked to Palmer for about 20 minutes yesterday. That was cool. Nice to have him around again to talk. I read alot yesterday. I finished the metamorphasis and started in on the chuck plalahniuk book. Good stuff, I am stoked once again with a little interesting poker. Prod away at my brain. I could use a massage.   current mood:  aggravated current music: clipped wings
