Well, I have a couple of titles you'll want to check out, because unlike most games that hit the bargain bin, these ones are actually good!    I'm not only posting this to give you guys great deals on cool games, but if we don't support this type of innovation and only go for the advertised, popular games such as the Madden Footballs, then developers will just make variations of current successful games rather than creating innovative, creative titles...and we don't want that! So go ahead, check out these title, you'll be pleasantly surprised what a game that costs under $20 can do!  So you're now saying "Well, if they're good, then why the hell are they in the bargain bin?" and I say to that "Because, they have very low sales records, which is unfortunate, but with all the big name companies and titles out there, sometimes these little innovations get left behind!"  Anyhow, without further delay, here's a list of good games you can get for cheap!  1.  Beyond Good  Evil (Xbox, PSC, GCN, PC)  - Crappy sales have forced this title to the bargain bin at rock bottom prices! And it's an amazing game! Top notch scores from Official Xbox Magazine, XGP Gaming, etc. - Definitely a good buy, fantastic experience in the action/adventure/platforming genres.  2.  I-Ninja (Xbox, PSC, GCN)  - This cartoony looking character can do tons of cool moves like run on walls, and all the cool stuff you would expect from a top notch well motion-captured game such as Prince of Persia, only this game can be found for half the cost! Give this one a chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  3.  Metal Arms: A Glitch In The System (Xbox, PS2)  - This game has flavours of popular games like Metroid Prime, etc. This game is probably one of the biggest "sleeper hits" of 2003. No one saw it coming, but this game delivers a great experience for a cheap price. - Another title that won't disappoint when given a chance.  4.  ICO (PS2)  - Here is a game that screams innovation and creativity! This is a fantastic game, but no one bought it! Now you can buy it for extremely cheap! So why not? - This game also has a very unique art style that looks fantastic!  5.  Armed  Dangerous (Xbox, PC)  - This game is another example of a funny, fast paced action game that is more fun thatn it is innovative, but still it's more important you have fun while playing a game, and you will when you play Armed  Dangerous.  5.  Breakdown (Xbox)  - here's a game that leaves you in a first person perspective for the ENTIRE time you play the game whether it be fighting, exploring or even vomiting! Yes, vomiting! - This is a pretty innovative title from Namco, that has a compeling story along with it. - It's pretty new, but already has been pushed to the bargain bin!  As well as the titles I've listed if you browse around online stores like  urlLink EBGames  you'll be able to buy the titles I listed, plus search for others you can get for a good price.  There's also plenty of titles for the Xbox which can be bought for $19.99 American, or $29.99 Canadian that are called "Platinum hits" meaning they have sold well, and are now being sold for cheap. Sony does the same thing, only they're PS2 games are called "Greatest Hits" when they are sold for the same price as Platinum Hits. Nintendo calls their cheap games that've sold well "Player's Choice".   Want to find out more about the above games or any other games for that matter? Simply go to  urlLink IGN ,  urlLink GameSpot ,  urlLink GameSpy , and others you'll find out there!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
