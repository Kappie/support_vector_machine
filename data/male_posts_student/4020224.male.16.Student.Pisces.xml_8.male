I think I will not go steady with (2) la. Cause look at the time. A few weeks more and the pre prelim will start. If I go steady with (2) it would be distracting RIGHT? So, I’ll wait till after ‘O’s maybe I start flirting to (1) only then. And I’ll repeat maybe k? Respect is something I have for everyone. Its just the amount of respect is different. Can’t wait for prom. For the people whose thinking of something bad…haha ish ish ish wats up man. I have great amount of respect for (1) k? So don’t you bull shit. That’s all for today blog blog blog wats up man
