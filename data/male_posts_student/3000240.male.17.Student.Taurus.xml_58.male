To write, compose, and perform music that defies the establishment in order to gain greater notoriety and eventually become part of said establishment which you must intrinsically scorn, this is the vicious circle that despite their greatest efforts, all stars and starlets with even a scintilla of a conscience must struggle to come to terms with. So it was in 1991 when Trent Reznor found himself precariously balanced on the edge of greatness.  Having recently released arguably the biggest selling Industrial album of all time (for the time), Pretty Hate Machine, and having wrapped up the hugely successful stint on the now legendary Lollapalooza tour, Reznor found himself wondering what the next move was to take his fledgling Nine Inch Nails to higher levels, despite the fact that they were already hurtling along with new momentum.  Prior to embarking on the Lollapalooza tour, Reznor had made it clear to TVT Records, his first record label which released NIN's debut album and subsequent singles, that Nine Inch Nails would not release another record under their watch.  Their meddling with Reznor's musical artistry on Pretty Hate Machine had enraged Reznor so much that he could no longer fathom working with anyone who would compromise the quality of his art without his say in the matter.  In addition, Pretty Hate Machine's success had made Reznor a producer in demand, and TVT resented and often attempted to thwart Reznor's numerous side-projects with bands such as Pigface and 1000 Homo DJs.  TVT, smelling the green resulting from the critical acclaim and widespread success of Nine Inch Nails' electric performances on Lollapalooza, was not ready to allow their budding star to walk away so easily, despite the fact that then TVT Records chief Steve Gottlieb admitted to causing the rift.  "Our relationship got dysfunctional.  I obviously let Trent down.  We're talking about the guy who wrote the lyric, "I'd rather die, than give you control!"  John Malm, Jr., Reznor's long-time manager, has said of that period, "Trent would have mowed lawns rather than make another record for TVT."  And so began a several years-long legal battle that is nearly legendary in the recording industry.  The chess match and legalmaneuveringg caused by Nine Inch Nails attempting to break away from TVT forced Reznor to actually record in secret.  Along with renowned producer Flood, Reznor fled to Miami Beach, among other locations, where he and Flood worked guardedly and secretly on the follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine.  Reznor had become bitterly jaded and disillusioned with the music industry, and admits to adopting a "snotty, elitist mentality, you're not cool enough to like my band, don't buy my records."  He "wanted to make a 'fuck you' record" to prove that he wasn't a sell-out, and also to reflect his general animosity towards life during the TVT fiasco.  Two years after it had begun, Nine Inch Nails' feud with TVT Records concluded with Jimmy Iovine, president of Interscope Records, actually buying out TVT in order to acquire NIN.  At first, Reznor was furious, seeing Nine Inch Nails' sale akin to being traded on a slave market, and has referenced it as such in past interviews.  Part of the deal, however, was the set-up of Reznor's own label independent of Interscope, to be called Nothing, that would allow Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails total artistic freedom.  Nothing Records' inaugural release was Broken, a harsh and angry six-track mini-record that was the result of Reznor's clandestine recording sessions during Nine Inch Nails' break from TVT Records.  While Reznor expected the switch to a major label would be perceived as a sell-out, thus alienating much of NIN's fans, Broken, which was intended as nothing more than a middle finger to pretty much everyone, garnered critical and commercial success.  So much so, that Broken was awarded no less than two Grammy's, to the surprise of both the recording industry in general and Reznor himself.  Broken was immediately followed up by Fixed, an allegorical indication of his transition from one record label to another.  Fixed was another six-track mini-album, which was comprised of the re-mixed and re-worked tracks from Broken.  Reznor took full advantage of his newfound freedom to work with other artists on Fixed, and Peter Christopherson of Coil and J.G. Thirwell, a.k.a. Clint Ruin, contributed their own unique interpretations of Nine Inch Nails' songs.  Fixed would mark the first Nine Inch Nails re-mix album, and this fondness for releasing re-mixed and varied interpretations, both by himself and other contributors, would continue throughout Reznor's career.  While Reznor's new Nothing Records set up official shop in Cleveland, Reznor found himself spending more and more time in New Orleans, a city fast becoming a retreat for extreme rockers looking to get off the radar for a brief respite.  Being so far removed from the West Coast, Hollywood intensity and fast-paced, urban sprawl of New York, New Orleans was a place where up and coming rock stars could go relatively unnoticed.  After a period of recuperation and reflection, getting used to the new freedom being enjoyed under Interscope, and the satisfaction of knowing the commercial success from Broken and Fixed, made on his own terms, Reznor was ready to begin work on the next, full-length Nine Inch Nails record.  He had a lot to live up to.  Nine Inch Nails' raucous tours, eclectic sound, and maelstrom of rumours and interesting 'pickles' that Reznor seemed to always land himself in had spawned a devout, cult-like following of fans.  Pretty Hate Machine was fast-approaching more than a million copies in sales in the USA, and the album was now consistently garnering favourable review and acclaim across the pond in the UK.  Having a solid idea for the direction of Nine Inch Nails, Reznor went shopping for a location in which he could hibernate while giving birth to his next musical creation.  After checking out several properties in the Los Angeles region, Reznor selected a big, beautiful home with a spectacular view of Los Angeles, and with a very reasonable price tag.  Reznor signed the deal and began to move in.  It would later be spectacularly revealed that said house was actually the location of the famous Charles Manson murders where Sharon Tate, wife of director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby), and four guests were gruesomely butchered in a bizarre, cult act the likes of which shocked America as badly as Hiroshima or President John F. Kennedy's assassination.  After finding out about his new, albeit temporary residence's history, Reznor remained unfazed, and elected to remain, even warming up to the place for the added, spookily cool aura it cast over recording sessions.  At least this is what we are led to believe.  This amazing revelation would have to be based on the assumption that Reznor, his agents, friends, and family did not clue into the history of said property during the course of acquiring it.  In addition, Trent Reznor would have been four years old when the Manson murders occurred.  Again, this was a murder/media event that was totally unprecedented in American history, and was the focal point of the media for months, years, and now even decades after the fact.  Further, the trials went on for years, and given ReznorÂs documented and rather obvious penchant for an interest in all things spooky, the odds are very good that Reznor knew exactly what property he was buying.  But why hide that fact?  First of all, perhaps no one denied anything.  The media would undoubtedly have attempted to contact Reznor's management or Reznor himself, but a lack of confirmation would have been at the mercy of the journalist's creative whim, and simply added to the larger myth.  Additionally, perhaps Reznor simply found it easier not having to explain why someone could possibly have an interest in such a place from a personal point of view, as the media would undoubtedly have twisted and perceived the explanation as nothing more than a publicity stunt; better to remain mysterious and dark, albeit ignorant, rather than an attention-seeking wannabe.  Rumours also dictate that the walls of one particular room still bore the infamous blood stained word "pig" scrawled on it.  This is simply not true.  While the word "pig" was written in blood, it was not inside the room that Reznor would in fact make the brains of his recording operation, and affectionately nickname Le Pig, or even in the house at all, for that matter.  In actuality, the word "pig" was on the front door of the house.  And even putting that fact aside, is it really plausible to believe that after all the investigation and trials, and subsequent renovations of the house to restore it to a condition suitable for sale, that the word "pig" would be left, in blood no less, on the wall/door of the house?  Highly unlikely, dear reader.  But it sure makes for more interesting journalism, doesn't it?  So, while Reznor claimed that the house's history did not bother him, it undoubtedly affected the mood and atmosphere of the recording sessions.  Reznor again exercised his freedom under Interscope and Nothing by calling on select musicians.  Notwithstanding his now staple producer, Flood, Reznor also called on Adrian Belew, the guitar legend behind many David Bowie masterpieces.  Stephen Perkins, drummer for Jane's Addiction laid down some percussion, and Alan Moulder was brought in to lend his considerable expertise at the mixing board.  Reznor recognized that a pattern had begun to emerge with Nine Inch Nails, and he "didn't want to box NIN into a corner, where everything had to be faster and harder than the last record."  Instead, Reznor wanted the next album "to be a departure from Broken...one ultra-fast chunk of death...This time I wanted to make an album that went in ten different directions, but was all united somehow."  Reznor had decided on somewhat of a concept album, where the record would have a unifying theme.  Where Pretty Hate Machine laid bare raw emotion, and where Broken and Fixed focused specifically on anger, Reznor turned inwards on himself once again, and dug deeper into his own psyche.  The theme of the record would follow the descent of an individual through their own inner revelations as they strip away every aspect of their very selves, and scrutinize the basic moral code that makes up society as a whole today: love, hate, religion, relationships, sex, violence, and vices as seen under a psychological microscope.  Examining every aspect to the finest detail, Reznor wrought a bleak, wallowing descent into introspection that would become the title for Nine Inch Nails' newest opus: The Downward Spiral.    Never had Reznor delved so deeply into his personal life, and The Downward Spiral represents a thorough purging for Reznor, to the point where Reznor has openly admitted he "out-bleaked" even himself and hopes to never again reach that point of despair.  Rather than the all-out aural assault that was Broken, The Downward Spiral was a haunting project that deftly combined texture and mood to evoke nerve-wrenching emotion.  Always one to admire full-bodied albums such as Pink Floyd's The Wall, Reznor attempted to create a record that required the listener sit down and absorb the album front to back, several times, before they began to come to the revelations behind the seeming caterwaul of sound.  He admired albums that slowly revealed themselves, and in the long run contributed to one's "musical vocabulary."  Reznor also recognized that he may aled the very un-radio friendly lyric "I want to fuck you like an animal" would, surprisingly, become their biggest single ever.  The track, edited to a friendlier, profanity-free version, received heavy rotation on the airwaves and huge underground success in clubs all over the world.  The accompanying video, directed by auteur Mark Romanek, closely paralleled the shocking content of "Closer" and hit the viewer hard with images of decapitated pigs' heads, crucified monkeys, naked flesh, and Reznor spinning maniacally out of control.  An extended version, "Closer to God" would later be released featuring various interpretations and some additional tracks.  Nine Inch Nails were a permanent success.  Trent Reznor had toiled and worked his way up from gopher at a local recording studio to a mainstream artist garnering critical acclaim from both established and newfound fans, and critics the world over.  The Downward Spiral represented a pinnacle of achievement in both Reznor's life, and in the history of music.  By looking into himself and laying bare all the deep and darkest secrets of his soul, Reznor had inadvertently connected with millions of others who exist on a common emotional plane.  The connection had to once again become physical.  After a three-year hiatus from touring, it was time for Trent Reznor to assemble hiser", a haunting piece of music that featured the very un-radio friendly lyric "I want to fuck you like an animal" would, surprisingly, become their biggest single ever.

Garnering a great deal of their initial attention and subsequent reputation from the live Nine Inch Nails experience, and now boasting a massive new fan base, Reznor's next challenge would be delivering that now legendary stage show to Nine Inch Nails' new and rabid fans worldwide. xBuBzx
