[Okay, just polite stuff.  Figured he'd say "good," give me my food, and I could be on my way.]  HIM: Not so good.  Stomach hurts a bit. ME: Hope not from the food.  [I gestured to the food he was serving me.  I thought I was being pretty clever there.]  HIM: Yeah, maybe.  [What??]  HIM: You know how the chef has to taste everything he cooks.  Sometimes when it's not quite cooked.  I think maybe that happened.  [What??]  HIM: So, yeah, my stomach's bothering me a bit.  Here's your food.  [What??]  He should watch out.  This is law school, after all.  If I get sick from the food, that conversation alone is probably enough for a decent settlement.  Wow.
