When I clench my fist or strecth my fingers to a certain parabola, the seem to lose all feeling literally. I mean it's scary. It's been getting progressively more apparent and hence far more noticeable and of a far greater degree of concern has succumb due to it. I don't really ever like going to the doctors about things, but if things keep going narrating themselves in this consistent fashion, then I may have no other alternative.  What worries me most is that, today especially, if someone would have asked me to carry something, I would most probably have dropped it, or not even clench it in the first place. At least it's something not typical I need worry about now, and not tiresome emotional issues. Good to be back *gulps* xBuBzx
