We took the entire morning rounds in our division, winning five rounds out of five.  But in the afternoon final rounds, since it was single-round elimination, we were defeated.  And only by 15 points!  Plus I think that the moderator accepted an answer she shouldn't have, tipping the round in their favor.  I wonder what team she was for...
