So, me, my sister Nicole, my dad, and my little sister Katie are walking in this old mansion, why? I have no clue. So we're walking and this old scrawny guy steps in front of us and tells us to come with him. So like dumbasses, we go with him, not knowing where we're going. So he takes us to this dried up underground stream that goes around this island, and tells us to stand in the middle of the island. Yup, you guessed it, we stood there. So he pulls this lever and tells us this one thing (forgot it's name) was really deadly and there was only one way from getting eaten. He wasn't going to tell us, just like the bad guy he is. So when this lever is completely down, this water looking stuff start pouring from this valve and with it, pops out this ugly green thing. It has a humungous head that seems to be made up of only it's teeth. From that spring this itty bitty tail. It's prolly about 8 foot long and is a sickly green color. So I'm worrying about that when this fat little thing jumps out of the tube and into the water. Suddenly, the water stops and these things start swimming around the island The guy tells us that, to escape, we must kill these things. I look at him like he's crazy, but of course, Nikki suddely jumps in the water. Now, the things start swimming faster and she's avoiding them with te grace of a figure skater. But the fat thing hits her side and the water start to turn murky red. MAN DOWN!!! So I jump in after her before the long skinny thing can get to her, but am almost too late. So I get her out of the water, and there is a fish caught in the pants. So i throw the fish back in the water towards the long thing, and it eats it! Of all the nerve to eat my insult. Thats not the worst of it...it turned around and pootered at me!!! I couldn't believe it. So anyway, Katie and I came up ith a great scheme to catch all the fish we could without getting eaten. The only problem...the fat thing didn't like fish. So it really was an insult to him. So we start climbing around like idiots looking for fish, when Katies shoe falls in the water. The little fat thing swam after it like it was pure gold. When it ate the shoe, it turned around and pootered at us. So we started collecting clothes. So we finally got everything and mananged to kill the fa thing...it rlly choked on the smell from Nikki's shoes. Now dad hasnt done anything except fiddle witha a stick this whole time. Finally, he walks to the edge and starts fishing! He caugfht the skinny thing tho. When it was out of the water, it's head started leaking ad then finaly it stopped moving. No the next part is basically like the first part, except imagine it all noen green. and we're in a boat, and there are fans around the corner. Yeah, kinda stupid. Then, there was a part of a dream that had nothing to do with green monsters and old guys. All I remember is stting in the bathtub with a laptop looking for something important. Don't think I ever found it.                Well, thats all for now...ttyl                *Hugs kisses and a little extra*
