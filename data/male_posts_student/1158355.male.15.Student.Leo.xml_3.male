It started off with me going to Dan's house and hurtling a box in his fence opening and me not seeing the hanging rope, jumped into it. Not knowing what happened I got up finding out my whole body had be flung back by a rope and the rope hit my mouth so now I have a cut there that looks like chocolate. Then me and Dan left to Pat's and waited for Eric to come over.then took Pat to "THE SUMP". The sump is an awesome sump with ice and a secret ice rink. Dan brought his camera so we recorded us falling all over the ice and us riding bikes on the ice and falling. Then me and Pat had an idea... a brilliant idea... that was actually retarded. We went into a sump manhole and crawled throughout the pipes of our neighborhood. Well, only about 50 ft. of crawling but it was fun. We were actually underneath the road and all we could hear was Eric screaming and soft pounds. We recorded all of what we did so I'm sure Dan... the film man, will make a video that will prove to you all we actually did it. He makes these movies and puts them online! He also made the jackbutt movies I'm sure you all know what they are. When me and Pat crawled out of the pipe and ran yelling at and recording Andrew English, an asshole 6th grader who beat up a kid with a heart thingy, was playing hockey with a kid who we all thought was Keith Buckheit. After that we went back to Pat's and after 10 minutes I finally discovered there was a walkie talkie under my ass (my walkie talkie) and it was rumbling from the voices. We listened to these two guys talk about Jerry M and a ROLADEX and a EXTERMINATOR? We must of jotted down like 10 phone numbers they told each other over the radio. Then Eric finally relized he jotted down the phone numbers on Lindsay, Pat's sister's phone list. He goes "oops" and shows us the paper which was by far the funniest thing of all day. Then the day was ending and I had to leave them to go to my cousin's where I was playing gamecube nonstop with Chris, my 10 year old cousin. We started playing Star Wars: Clone Wars and the YUB YUB music came on. Now I've loved this song since I was... what... 6? So I haven't heard it in so long, I was so excited and me and him started dancing to the song like crazy. Sure enough everyone in my family was watching us cracking up. I also beat Mario Party 4 for Chris which was incredibly easy, Bowser is an asshole! We also played Super Mario Sunshine where we heard Bowser's voice... pretty cool. Thanks to Chris I downloaded that song and listen to it more than any song I've ever listened to. The football game was great because one side of my family was rooted for the Raiders and the other including me for the bucs! Oh god that was the most exciting game ever.
