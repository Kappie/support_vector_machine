WARNING! there is some MALE nudity. if you are easily offended, I cannot recommend that you watch these movies! Be forewarned!  anyways, it's good to be back after my last blog attempt failed miserably, and I hope this one turns out better than the last. pics coming soon! I plan to "antique" a friend of mine on an upcoming trip to seattle...
