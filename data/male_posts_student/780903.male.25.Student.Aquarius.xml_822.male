On that note...  Top five Google searches by law students nationwide:  1. "Answers to my upcoming exam" and "that none of my classmates can find"  2. "Default on your student loans" and "legally" 3. "Evidence professor" and "naked" 4. "Britney Spears" and "wishes she was dating a law student" 5. "Legal ethics class" and "free term papers"
