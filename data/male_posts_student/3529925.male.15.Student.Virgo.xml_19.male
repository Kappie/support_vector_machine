I managed before she start invadingthat particularanatomical region ofmy personal space.  "Come on. It'll be fun. I promise.." She giggled mysteriously. I could smell the alcohol on her breath, and decided it would most definately be in my favor to avoid this encounter with the girl whose name I wasn't even sure of.   "N-n-no..." I stammered as she came even closer, "maybe I can just call you. In fact, I think that will have to do... uh.. hey.. HEY! Stop that. Hey...." I forced her off me as gently as I could - and she didn't resist. Instead, she emptied the contents of her stomach onto my head.    Istaggered out of the bathroom thoroughly disgusted and wondering why I had even come to David's party. David's parents were out of town, and he had promised that this would be the best party I had been to all year. Since I hadn't been to any thus far, I would have to concede to that. The hall outside of the bathroom was completely trashed - along with the rest of the house, it seemed. A picture of his family, his dog, sister, and father,wasshattered on the ground. His mother had died three years ago, when we were all in 8th grade. I still remember the evening, the car crash. Things had been pretty crazy, and they had messed David up considerably. The kid had issues before his mother's death, and the tragic incident hadn't helped him at all. His sister, who was two years older than all of us, was a pothead prior to her mother's demise, and started dabbling in other things to deal with the pain. You know what they say... the "gateway drug." In this case, it most certainly was.    As I suspected, David's living room was trashed. It was around 4 in the morning, and there were bodies scattered throughout the room. It felt as though I had entered an ancient crypt where the bodies smelled of sweat and alcohol, rather than rot. Some bodies were draped over couches, others on the floor. Some were entwined with others, some half-naked. All of the bodies shared one common trait: a motionless state bearing a likeness to that of death. David made his way through them, clearly trying not to disturb any of them (as if he could have), and started toward me.   "So.. uh, you taking off? The party's just getting started man!"Dave smirked at me and threw me the bottle of whatever he had just gotten wasted on.   "Yeah man.. uh... great .. party, but I've gotta go. I don't even know what I'm going to tell my parents. I stayed out way too late." I offered uncertainly. David probablywouldn't even remember this tommorow, I noted the wafting stench of alcohol that led me to believe he was on the verge of passing out.   "Aight dude. Later..." David forced himself to sayas his voice faded and he started to take a southerly trip to meet his good friend 'drunkoffyourass'. I caught him on his way down and laid him on the floor. Damn. This led me to ponder my recent concern, namely, what the hell was I going to do about my parents?
