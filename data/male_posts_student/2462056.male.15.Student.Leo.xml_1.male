I don't really have a reason to not be in one... and this is like, the first time I've really been in a bad mood since like... a really really long time, because I always try and make everything into a good situation. I'm sure this will go away tomorrow when I wake up.  I miss my friends like crazy! They all just got back, and now they are leaving again.  I'm really happy for them because they are going to have a great time where they go to.  Claire is going to a soccer camp until Sunday, and Jesse is going to Panama City Beach until Sunday.  I have a lot of other good friends in Auburn, but no one can really replace Jesse or Claire... At least I got to hang out with Claire a little today.... I haven't even seen Jesse in like, 3 weeks.  I went with Claire and Dabney and Edward and saw Dodgeball today, which was funny.  Then I went home and I was stuck at home because my parents went out to eat so I had to watch my sister.  It sucked too, because I wanted to hang out with Jesse and Claire, but I was stuck at home, and Claire or Jesse couldn't come over.  Jesse had to pack and Claire couldn't get over here.  I'm working on another song... just kinda cutting and pasting stuff like, inside my head... nothing written on paper yet though, hopefully I'll get to that step soon.  I'll post it up here whenever that happens.  Much love.
