Leaving second base, Bonner-Jackson stumbled on the slick grass.  The pitcher, Mike Blum, corralled the ball kicked right back to the mound and stood a mere 10 feet away the runner.  Blum quickly closed the gap and looked for the peg, which is when ABJ saw his chance.  Using his plastic man-like abilities he managed to maneuver his body around the hurled sphere causing it to sail into the outfield.  Bonner-Jackson then scooted around 3rd and headed home as BGB went onto route the higher ranked Fleeing Villagers.  On the ground one second, thanks to some amazing agility, standing on home plate the next.  Aaron Bonner-Jackson thank you for another Great Moment in Kickball.
