Well according to me, Mr. Bishwas Paudel a pigeon is most annoying bird ever to date. The reason I hate pigeons is because they crap all over the balcony and make retarded noise. All the pigeons should be caught and be send to a mental institution. I bet most of you would agree with my thesis. I have tried so much to get rid of these birds. Back in the days when I was young I used to have a slingshot with which I would snipe birds with. The name “PIGEON” was always in my head. I really wanted to hunt down this bird. Even though with my hard efforts, I kept missing and missing when I was firing rocks that went like bullets towards my prey. Because I didn’t get that bird that time I doesn’t mean that I have quit preying for this bird. Maybe one day I am going to finally seek revenge on this bird.      Whoever is reading this please don’t let the pigeon know that I am making plans to kill it.   Let’s keep it our little secret, OK?
