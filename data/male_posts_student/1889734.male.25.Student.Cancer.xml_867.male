And when David Kay goes in and says we haven't found stockpiles yet, and there's theories as to where the weapons went. They could have been destroyed during the war. Saddam and his henchmen could have destroyed them as we entered into Iraq. They could be hidden. They could have been transported to another country, and we'll find out." -G.W. Bush, Meet the Press, 2/7/04 So I guess I mispoke. I said that Bush admitted there were no weapons in Iraq. I should have said he admitted that he has failed to  find  any weapons in Iraq. Too bad you don't probe  him  for proof the way you do  me .  Mike says: "The truth is we can't really say for certain."  While I think it's safe to safe to say that we're never going to find such weapons, let's look at it your way. We really can't say for certain, huh? OK, fine, we can't. However... "We found the weapons of mass destruction. We found biological laboratories...for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, they're wrong, we found them." -G.W. Bush, at an interview in Poland, 5/29/03 Just because we  can't  say for certain doesn't mean Bush  won't  say for certain.  Mike says: "The evidence that he had them, was planning on getting them, and used them is in the CIA report above."  Well, he certainly acted on that report, didn't he? I mean, wow! He acted the hell out on it! Way to take action, Bush! Too bad he didn't do the same with  urlLink this daily briefing from August 6, 2001.   Mike says: "Where is your evidence? This isn't a matter of logic or ideas but of simple hard facts."  Here's a hard fact: Saddam didn't plan the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers. Osama bin Laden did. And what does Bush have to say about Osama bin Laden? "I don't know where he is.You know, I just don't spend that much time on him... I truly am not that concerned about him." -G.W. Bush, at a press conference, 3/13/02  Mike says: "Bush lied!" is insufficient.  He told false information to the American people, built upon our fears, and lead us into a war based on this fear he instilled. "Relaying false information that he was told was true." That's what some call it it; others call it a lie. Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore had this very interpretation battle not long ago. I understand that you aren't particularly fond of Michael Moore. Do you really want to reinact this discussion he had?     AT LEAST NO ONE DIED WHEN CLINTON LIED
