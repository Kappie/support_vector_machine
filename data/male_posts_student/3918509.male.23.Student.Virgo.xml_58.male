Many thanks to Phil for sharing his blog with Matt and I!  First, (note the absence of "firstly": someone who knows who she is spent a lot of time coaching me on the irrelevance of the "ly") my name is Anthony Williams.  I am a 2002 graduate of Hillsdale College, majoring in history and minoring in German.  My history specialty is the early American republic and constitutional issues.  The rest of my interests range from Harry Potter to Russia to the ancients, to system administration, networking, gaming, and in my spare time, woodcarving.    I had, and still do have, my own personal blog, as linked up there in the right-hand column.  For reasons that are of little interest, I had to secure my Livejournal, as Phil said.  But I still enjoy thinking about political things, writing my thoughts out, and posting them for public review.  So, I suggested to Phil and Matt that we collaborate on a group blog; all were amenable, and the easiest solution was to modify Toyah into a multi-author blog.  Besides, Phil already had a cool name, one that wasn't likely to be taken by anyone else.  It was big news last week when John Kerry chose John Edwards to be his running mate.  Well, actually, it was kind-of-big-news.  I admit I was surprised a little: I didn't think Kerry would pick someone so unlike himself, someone who could easily end up overshadowing him (I refuse to make lame jokes about their respective heights).  My impression of Kerry is a weak man; not a bad man, but one who is easily controlled by stronger characters.  He is credited with some courageous actions in Vietnam, to be sure, but we need someone who is strong and courageous now, not who was strong and courageous in 1968.  And his recent record does not impress me as a courageous or strong record.  Furthermore, to be blunt, John Kerry is boring.  He doesn't have a charismatic voice or tone of speaking, and doesn't frequently smile (but, to give him his due, he does have a nice smile when he does).  So, by contrast to John Edwards, he's quite gray, while Edwards is colorful.  I haven't personally heard Edwards speak, but I hear he does well, and he certainly sounds cheerful, and likes to smile.  Presidents aren't elected on their smile alone, or so we hope, but a successful candidate has to be able to connect to the people.  I think the Kerry campaign is hoping that Edwards will be able to help Kerry out in that regard.  It may work, but I don't think it'll matter.  I don't ever recall voting for a vice-president myself, nor ever speaking with someone who had.  People always vote for the man at the top of the ticket.    I wonder though, if this is good for John Edwards?  Does anyone remember Dukasis' running mate?  Where is Dan Quayle, today?  Who ran with Bob Dole?  Could Al Gore get elected in Tennessee today, I wonder?  If the challenger doesn't get elected, the vice president candidate is forgotten even more than the challenger is.  That might be good: maybe Dukasis' VP was able to resume his own political career (though, I'm guessing it hasn't been very spectacular).  But if anything "bad" emerges during the campaign, the VP will be stained too, if not as badly as the president-candidate himself.  Likewise, even if the president-candidate is elected, the VP must run, later, with the shadow of the President over him, a problem that Al Gore had in 2000.  Of course, if the President is popular, the VP could ride into office on his coattails, as George Bush the first did.  But it seems to me that, politically, it's rather dangerous to run for Vice-President.  If I were John Edwards, I'd have declined.
