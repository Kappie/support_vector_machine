He is from a neighbourhood school somewhere in the east. John is quite a handsome guy and so, he has a girlfriend, let's call her Jane. Jane is from the choir, but Jane is an ah lian. Jane smokes alot, and she drinks alot, anything from tiger to VSOP. She was unlike John who was this guai kia, very good in his studies, never smokes and drinks anything from Liang Teh to diet coke. Naturally, John's friends thought the match was total crap, and would refer to them as John and that pai kia.  One day, John and Jane were walking along Tampines mall. When they saw 6-7 indian girls, dressed in all black, 666 tatooed on their arms, making a wierd noise. Upon careful listening, John realized that it was the chorus of the hit song of a Hindi trash metal band. Jane suddenly froze, "Wah lau eh, all those keleng kia, under block 854 i fight with them before, ooi dahling ah, faster zhao ah, my gang not here.". Naturally John and Jane, walked away, trying to look as inconspicious as possible.  Looking concerned John told Jane ,"But dear, didn't I told you to quit being part of the gangs a long time ago? You know those are bad company." Jane retorted ,"Ooi, dun kao peh kao bu can or not? These are my hia ti, I leave is cannot go back, is betray hia ti, u ask me leave is ask me to Kee see understand or not?". But the commotion attracted the Indian girl gang who happened to walk past.  "Hey you...Vanakam, dat dey we fight u at the block 865, we Indian the maths very good dey, number we remember good good. Ahh, we now not want to fight fight lah, but our hand all itchy itchy, still mus fight. You tell ur chinese gang come and fight, tonight same place." The girl paused for a while, then continued"......ehh I tonight meeting Muthu, cannot lah we all go and eat Briyani dey, cannot, tomorrow we go fight.". Then, they walked away, now singing the sitar solo of that hindi song.  With this, Jane called up the gang leader, "ooi, those see keleng kia want to fight ah, tomorrow night, ask our hia ti come.". "eh, John ah..."....before she could finish, she realized that he had walked away, and she dunnoe if he was heartbroken at her insistence to continue with such gang activities, or did he just simply  lose his balls when those Indians came.   Find out on the next episode of...........shit, haven't thought of a title....
