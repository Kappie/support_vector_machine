That has nothing to do with anything, that was more a tribute to Randomness.      This week has been interesting, although not to much has happened, I think I have rejusted back to University.       So as i said not to much has happened in Alandia, I went to an Auction, did a research thing for psyc, learnt i was a thinking thing and took a stance against the over use of capitial letters.      So I am going to do what any good television producer does, when they run out of ideas and can't be bothered with spelling or grammer. Yes i am going to do, one of those half arsed memory episodes, all i need is some chimes and some bad special effects.      Ohh here is something interesting....      Once upon time in the wonderful land of Indro, there lived a boy with a 3 letter long name. His name was Adz, he and Az where good friends and did lots (stupid) stuff together. But i only have the attention spand to write like this for a relatively short period of time, so i will only be telling about one certain set of events.       Adz was excited.
