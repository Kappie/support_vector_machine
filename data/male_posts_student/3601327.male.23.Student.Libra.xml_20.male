Can anyone tell me why we should even be involved in the organization in any meaningful way, or why they matter on the world stage?   From my perspective they are one of the most corrupt organizations I've ever seen, their policies are a joke and they are basically a huge waste of money and time. But somehow they have a legitimacy confered upon them by people who believe in the concept of the U.N. The concept is nice, but the execution seems to be seriously flawed these days.
