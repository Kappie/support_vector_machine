Anyways, put on comments who you think it is. Stuff has been so slow lately, I'm so bored. I need people to do stuff with over the summer....I'm gonna be so lonely. So I'm hiring a friend. I'll pay 10 dollars an hour if your a guy, 15 if your a girl. Call me if you want an interview for this job at 453-8868. Anyways....so very bored.  urlLink Go here and take this quiz . It's probably way to easy, but this way I can get mad at people who don't make a 100. Anyhow....so very bored..... I can't wait 'till next year. It's gonna be really interesting with all the new people in band. Apparently Torry's sister (ok, I know that's not how you spell his name) is really hot. Ashley told me that one. Well, since no one would ever like me, I'll somehow hook her up with Daniel Ponder. He hates it when I do stuff like that. In ways I am dreading the summer, in others I can't wait. I will be working, and that's a plus. Also, there are certain things I need to get over that I'm not 100% done with yet (you all know what I'm talking about) and I'm hoping that going through the summer without seeing certain people will make those feelings fade. However, it's going to be a depressing time. No one is going to call me, nor do anything with me. But oh well, not much I can do about that. If your reading this Jena, I'm here for you. Next Thursday is gonna be weird....Ashley is coming to my house, now there's a scary thought. Anyways, that's all for now. I think I will post again later tonight. Gotta call Bob to get that saxophone.....maybe I'll have him meet me tommarrow in band.
