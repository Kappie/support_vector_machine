Thursday I felt kind of sick so I opted to not go to class. (I need to learn to stop wearing shorts when it's 50 degrees out). I spent the whole day drinking tea and sleep and I feel better now, bessides the lingering phlegm. What was really weird was the fact that I emailed my professor to say that I was ill and wouldn't make it to class, and she replied back saying that class was cancelled due to someone jumping off our library tower. Apparently the guy is still alive right now. It's a 16 story building.  Some patterns in life in one asking oneself existential questions. People have told me that this reoccuring pattern isn't necessarily a bad thing and it simply demonstrates my good qualities. While I do find it an honorable thing, I question my mettle for dealing with such things. I don't really want to get into a lot of detail here, but some people will get what I'm talking about.  I need to go to school today and make photocopies.  **
