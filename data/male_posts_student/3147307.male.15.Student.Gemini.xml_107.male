Our Internet messed up again :(  Its funny that now 4 of my linked blogs are not being updated (Allen, Joe, Katie, Charity) and now it seems as nobody gets on. All I could do for awhile was audioblog but it is not quite the same. yet, EVERYONE should try to audioblog once - it is really cool. You do it all over the phone once you set it up - and it is F-R-E-E. Oh, and I think I might add a quote of the day - may last a couple of days but hopefully longer. They will be more humorous then serious.  "The day after tomorrow is the third day of the rest of your life." George Carlin (I have no clue who George Carlin is)
