While looking for articles on the library levy, I saw this from the blog of the plain dealer, this is a shocking to me, an editor not afraid to ask what all the fuss is about, the same fuss that is selling his paper!   Wednesday, February 11, 2004     SERVICE RECORD I read with growing disbelief the escalating debate over the military service of George Bush and John Kerry.   The President served in the Air National Guard during the Viet Nam War. Sen. Kerry was a Naval officer in Viet Nam and was decorated for his combat service.  Bush detractors say he was AWOL during a portion of his Guard service and, in essence, dodged service in Viet Nam.  Kerry detractors say he should be condemned for his denunciation of the war after his discharge.  As someone who didn't try hard enough to get a deferment or find a refuge in some socially acceptable form of service such as the National Guard, I wound up going into the Army, getting commissioned and serving in Viet Nam.  Like almost everyone I served with, I envied the Guardsmen who missed Viet Nam. And like the vast majority of Americans, I opposed the war.  Those who actually served opposed it with a bit more passion as did their loved ones. My wife's car, for example, bore a bumper sticker common to the time: "Another Mother for Peace."  So to Bush's detractors: Why demean him for doing what anyone with any sense would have done? If you can escape getting shot at by an angry enemy, why not?  And to the Kerry detractors: Why demean his valiant service because he had the good sense afterward to denounce a stupid war?  What riles me about Bush is his refusal to admit that his Guard Service was a Viet Nam avoidance plan. It riles me because there's nothing wrong with such a plan. Millions of young men did some version of it.  And what riles me about the attacks on Kerry's post-service anti-war stance is that it was too late in coming, though for all I know he was just like every other GI over there. He wanted out and the war to end. And what was wrong with that?  The problem with Bush admitting the truth, I guess, is that it might seem unmanly to some and, in light of his sending young men off to war, hypocritical.  Healthy fear of real danger isn't unmanly, it's logical.  I'll leave the determination of hypocrisy to others.
