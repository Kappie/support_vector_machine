("LUKE, ICH BIN IHR VATER")  When I got home I saw something pretty damn funny...next door's gazebo thing had been overturned in the wind and was sorta starting to come over our fence. Pics soon. But not now.  And today has a multitude of funny news stories! Heres the top 3 headlines: "South African Man Kills Designer for Criticizing Home" "Swiss Soccer Fans Pin Down England with Voodoo Campaign" "South African Government Launches Colorful Condoms"  Out of those 3, the first is funniest, heres some quotes from it.  "A South African man told a court how he hacked to death his interior designer because she criticized his decor, local newspapers reported on Tuesday."  ""We went through the house and I told her what I wanted. She did not make any nice comments about my place so I went to my garage and fetched an axe," the Star newspaper reported him as saying."  ""I killed her because she reminded me of an old school teacher whom I hated very much.""  "Da Silva told the Pretoria High Court that voices in his head had instructed him to become a serial killer, the Star said."  Shouldn't really be funny...BUT IT IS! Bwahahahahahaha!
