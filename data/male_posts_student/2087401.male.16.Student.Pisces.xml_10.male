I was doing Math with Jane *Duong and this guy and then I was at home with this palm pilot thingy, but I vaguely realized I was supposed to be at school.  Then Tim and John *Dimmick came by and sat down in the family room.  We started talking about Stargate, and Jane came back hen the doorbell rang.  Dad, Grandma, Levi, Mom, Cristian and his family, and Colin were there, and we all left, ostensibly to see a play in spanish, but we actually went to this wooden castle place full of people.  While I was hanging on a rope trying to pull my shes out of the water, Kaylen, our assistant principals daughter, asked me to help her find a soapstone whale. Next thing I remember I was staying in classy hotel along with a whole bunch of other people.  I went up to I think the arcade, and on my way back down, I ran into Zach Dzuba, Cristian, Erin *Carpenter, Jonah, and Jessica, all of whom were headed for an auction.  I joined them, then realized I had forgotten to wear pants, so I went back to my room and got some.  By the time I got back, the auction was over, and this skinny, thirty-something lawyer type was whining at Jonah.  And jonah told him he "talked to damn much!".   And that's all I remember.
