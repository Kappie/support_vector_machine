This computer lets me use blogger so expect Shutt on MSN AND posting on the website. Holy cow. Awesomeness.   Blanding is the coolest. Lots of nice people who arent judgemental (yay! it feels like Pakistan!) but overall things are nice.  See you all on the 21st or the 22nd. Until then....  Shutt out
