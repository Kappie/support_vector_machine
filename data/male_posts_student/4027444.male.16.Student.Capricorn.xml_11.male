I have a ton of work to do preparing for the exam, and plenty of homework on top of that so I guess I'm keeping busy.On the bright side my summer school is in the city, which let's me get some downtown air (I love cities) and get away from the suburbs (The Brave New World). Along the way to school I pass a government administration complex that used to be a factory in the 19th century (it's one of those old, heavy, red-brick buildings with the tall dark windows). On the other side shines a small, but impressive ZEROX office building. Walking up that road during my 15min lunch break I had a great idea for a shot ("Past And Present") and rediscovered my love of photography. The problem is I read plenty of books and argue with everyone over politics (intellectual fuffilement) so now I'm looking for ways to fufil myself artistically. DeviantART is a great place for inspiration and I think photography might take me to my complete artistic self-fuffilement.Now if only I could find my camera...
