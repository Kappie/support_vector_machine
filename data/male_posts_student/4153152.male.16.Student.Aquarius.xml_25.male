It's just an awesome feeling to know that you took that piece of wet dirt and made something great. It takes patience, however, so 98% of the United States is out. But anyway.  I'm really amped about getting some filming done tomorrow. We'll have 5 people over here and get some of scene one eaten away. By the end of the day, I'm hoping that we'll have enough done for me to make a short promo in Windows Movie Maker. It's underpowered but it gets the job done.  You know the details, I'll be back when this is all over.
