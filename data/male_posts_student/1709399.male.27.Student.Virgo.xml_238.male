Shouvik  I decided to spread awareness about the existence of such a Sanctuary and also the need to protect it. We posted a Write-up in the NDTV Website. Here is the  urlLink URL  .                                            Thanks to a friend of mine (Akash) , Hindustan Times also wrote an article about the neglect of the Sanctuary and we were interviewed for that article by Anu . The Article came in the Last Thursday edition of HT . I will try to scan it  post it soon. Sadly in India environmental awareness is the least of priority because we have far too many other problems to contend with. But the relation between Nature  Animals is a very tenuous one and unless we take steps to protect it , our survival would remain a question mark as we head towards the future.
