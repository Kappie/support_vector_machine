Except maybe for the monetary value, a little decent way of living, cleaner environment, saner gov't  politics, some babes here  there, and most of my immediate families are here, but other than that, what's there to like America? I might really sound stupidly sarcastic but whatever happens  whatever it is, my heart  soul belongs to Mother Philippines ( ofcourse Whoever it is "up" there). Now only if the CIA-NBI won't intercept this message  suspect me as a fanatic madman (which I don't know if I am  *gulp).   About the 20,000 question game --- I'm always game as long as I'm cyber(ly) kickin'.   :)
