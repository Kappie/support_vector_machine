Kick the teachers, kick the chairs! Throw the teachers down the stairs!  ...In wheelchairs!   My eyes have seen the glory of the burning of the school We have tortured every teacher We have broken every rule And we strangled Mrs. Chu Until her neck was black and blue  AND PEACE GOES MARCHING ONNNNNN~    WS
