I have to admit I am feeling a new regard to reality after just hearing about the situation of a friend and her family. Only a few things are truly important in life, and they are the least easy to attain, and to understand. There is little certainty, but these are the things that really matter.  Well I have been on my holidays, after stopping my daily travels to my job in Bristol (15 hour days are too much). It seems like I have been busy, but as usual no surprise - I havent managed to get much done. I receieved some more dvds - Cruel intentions (one of my favourites, and also for some of you too I remember ;), 1492 - conquest of paradise (Columbus discovers paradise, then sees it ruined, very good), and a bbc series with Sam Neil (Space, basically a series on space with really good graphics and music - for kids allegedly but I had to really concentrate to take some of it in).  My computer isnt good enough to use skype (for calling computer to computer, or computer to landline phones), but I am going to try it this week on my sister's  her boyfriend's computer. If it works I can prepay (like with a mobile) and should be able to call internationally with it for 2 cents (euro cents) per minute - brilliant! It will save me a lot compared to the last 2 weeks.
