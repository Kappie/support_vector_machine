A friend from quite a while ago re-entered my life.  When I met her somewhere around 6 years ago, she became the picture of everything I wanted to be, musically.  She remained very present in my mind for the next 4 or 5 years, and every once in a while would pop up somewhere I was- American Eagle when I worked there my senior year, a Hyannis Sound show my first summer in the group-and when she didn't know I was part of it, Hyannis Sound's alumni tour in Burlington, VT.  She spent this past summer in Tennessee doing music stuff, so she didn't visit the Cape.  Our mutual friend Sarah provided me with periodic updates on her status, and gave me her contact info (which, per usual, I promptly misplaced) and then she ended up reading my blog and getting my screen name and IMing me just last week.  And so it began...  She came to visit on Wednesday--my father's birthday--and we spent about 3 hours talking and walking up and down the beach near my apartment.  To attempt to describe the events of the last 4 days past that would be a complete and utter failure... it's impossible.  But I've been blessed with a new and overwhelming clarity in my life, and I have her to thank.  So thank you.  Thank you more than words can say.  "I'm so grateful for every heartache, and everything that came my way that I didn't want to happen at that time.  I thank God Almighty for getting me out of my own way."  In unrelated news, Meredith, you're in my heart and my prayers tonight.  And when you're ready or you need me, I'm here.  You know how to find me.  "You always told me what it is I needed to hear.  Not always what I wanted to hear, but what I need to hear..."  So grateful...
