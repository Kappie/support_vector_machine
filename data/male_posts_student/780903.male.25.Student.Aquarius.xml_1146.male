And then on Friday... well... it was Monday all over again.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  I just bought more dress socks.  And a gray pair of pants, since I was alternating navy and tan (not the same pairs -- I have a bunch of each) and needed some variety.  And a cool-looking wrinkle-free blue shirt on sale that I liked, so I couldn't resist.  It was really cheap.  I didn't need to resist.  I got a paycheck yesterday for the first week of work.  My shirt cost about 1.5% of my weekly take-home pay.  That's about 45 minutes of work I guess.  Actually, that makes it sound like lot.  I'd rather go home 45 minutes early one day than have the shirt.  Uh oh.  Did I mess up?  Whatever.  I can afford the shirt.  Barely.  But I can.  I also bought a new toothbrush, since I was almost due for one, a magazine, and a smoothie.  My shopping spree.  Extraordinary, really.  And then I went to the public library for some books for the daily subway commute, since I'd finished what I had lying around.  Early in the week I read "Live From New York," the 600-page history of Saturday Night Live that came out about 18 months ago.  Solid.  Enjoyable.  A bit too long.  But good reading.  And then I read "Count Down," which is like the movie "Spellbound" but about the International Math Olympiad and the 6 kids on the U.S. team.  It was a little too quick, actually -- I could have enjoyed another 100 pages or so, and some more depth.  Too lightweight.  I recommend, but only if you think it sounds like something you'd like even if I didn't recommend.  It's not a must-read.  Then on Friday I took with me a book of essays about Paris by 1920s journalist Joseph Roth that a relative recommended.  It was a little too literary for me.  Didn't grab me, at least not on the subway.  Just didn't do it.  So, I got 6 books from the library.  Nothing I'm really, truly excited about reading, but all things I think will be decent enough for the commute.  I need to find a better library.  I will report as I complete.  Probably up first on Monday will be Ken Auletta's "Backstory" about the business of journalism.  We'll see.
