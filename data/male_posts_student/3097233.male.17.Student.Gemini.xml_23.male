Now I know I haven't posted in a -really- long time, but nothing really has changed in my life, I have a job, wow ~_~ a dishwasher.. How... Important? Well, there is one thing that has changed with me now though, it is that I was invited to a game, Ragnarok, specifically the Valhalla server. Well, to cut out a few weeks I made two characters, one I don't use any more so no use putting that blab in here but I'll skip to Rithem. He is a bard, he acts like me, which is good, because it is me after all. Well, in vRO, bards are not very strong, at least not alone are they strong, they are a support person, much like a dancer is, until you get them together. And this is when the woman I will call Her comes in, and an entrance she made into my life too.. I'll just back some, not far because I only recently met Her, as of today it will be 4 days, and well, emotions can be a pain in the ass some times cause she had that effect on me, it was an instant attraction. It probably was the best thing so far for a -long- time in my life. I don't want to do something stupid and mess up, well not any more than I did today just a little while ago.... I'll explain I guess, because if you are reading this you either are too bored to care or you actually care and want to know so either way if you made it this far you better read onward. Her and I met 4 days ago, from today. In vRO, at Prontera Fountain and then moved north to the benches to have a little peace from the noise of markets and n00bs. We talked a little and because she is a Dancer, it went well, Her and Rithem, Dancer and Bard. Well we agreed to party and gain some Exp for our characters. Either way, to skip some of the boring things [at least boring to a reader], I will carry you into yesterday, when we exchanged Yahoo and MSN IDs so that we could talk more often and easily. The day carries on and we come to a few more personal parts which I'll just say some cause yea, unless you are Her you don't need to know them and because -she- knows them because she was there, there is no point in me restating. To cut things shorter, I began to like her, a lot, more than I probably should of for having met her so recently but you know, I'm not the most intelligent male in the world and she was hard to not become extremely attached to, *cling* as she puts it. *grins*. At any point I will get to the 'drama' of what happened, how today became a roller coaster of emotions. I begin with waking up, after sleeping so poorly that I couldn't have paid somebody to spit on me. I hadn't had food yet and I went to the net, for a little revival hopefully and sadly She wasn't on yet, and wouldn't be for about and hour. So I read through her profile, she is just about my age, [yes, she is -very- cute because I have a few of her pictures and her eyes are the most attractive things in the world. Her eye! -> urlLink http://pages.ivillage.com/crimsonsilverhawk//eye.jpg  ], I thought she was a little older than me, which was kind disturbing, me reading things wrong again of course and that started the conversation off badly when I talked to her when she first got on, and I apologize to Her. Day goes on, we are playing some pool and of course, she is winning. In the mean time we are flirting some, off and on while we play pool and the topic becomes discussion. I don't much like talking about this topic, because, well, as she put it I am coward, LOL, true, and I know I'm shy. Things went down hill fast and things were said that I shouldn't of, [like normal]. Being the wonderfully perfect female that I don't see how anybody could ever mistreat her she seems to of forgiven me, partly how she is putting it now, and well maybe fully by the time I finish writing this. And anybody who knows me knows I'm and idiot at times, and this is one of those times I'm gonna be a big idiot and take a chance for once and stop being such a coward in life. I will put it plain and simple, and those of you that don't like it I guess can go bite yourselves but I believe that I'm falling in love with the most wonderful girl imaginable... And I have to wait and hope that she will take me back fully and then wait until she is available to date.
