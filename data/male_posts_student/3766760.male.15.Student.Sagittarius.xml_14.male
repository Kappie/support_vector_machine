We got to Onset around 6-6:30 and sat on the beach the entire time. The fireworks started around 9:10. Me and Courtney had fun trying to dam the water from her Scooby-Doo blanket. The fireworks were pretty good. Some of them I've never seen before. But we had fun. The fireworks ended at 10, and we didn't get home until a little after midnight. It literally took 35 minutes to et out of our parking spot and we were out of the parking lot at 11. PIGS SUCK!! cops of course. 2 cops, standing at the intersection, directing traffic, wouldn't let our street go, so everyone was beeping at the pigs to let us go, it was ... idk. but it was still fun.
