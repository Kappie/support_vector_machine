Would we have to have prisons. Would we have any government at all.  To be totally free, we would have to rid ourselves of all establishments of government, which is an anarchy.  Now i dont know about you guys out there, but I personally prefer to have it so that a killer can  NOT  come into my house at night and kill me.  Sooooooooooo............I guess what I'm really trying to say is:  "All you poser anarchists out there are really annoying and have no idea what you are saying."
