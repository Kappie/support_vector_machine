I had some chores to do outside anyhow though, so I just kinda got those done. I also got more of my room back in, my room. lol. I think you will definitely like the new layout, pretty suave ;) lol.  the power finally came back on and i enjoyed being able to listen to music once more. I got some work work done scanning some pictures and such, but other than that was really bored. took a nap, and when I woke up, i coulda sworn you were there, was the weirdest feeling, but in a good way :)  this evening planning on going to visit andy at work once more, then maybe hang out with heidi and tessa again after that. i really wanna play a game of risk too, but im just a geek and no one else here wants to, lol.  so um, yeah, that has been my uneventful crap day, hopefully yours at the waterpark, er, aquapark, went better (i think that is where you are/were today). My love for you is greater than the skies at night and deeper than the depths of the sea, and there is nothing that I want more, than to have you once more next to me. And yes I came up with that all by myself *snuggles*  *mwah*
