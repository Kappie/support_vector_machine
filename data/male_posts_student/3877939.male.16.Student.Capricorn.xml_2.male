This is the result of a late night decision, so not sure where this one is going. I've never really had a 'log', for lack of a more common and manly word (meaning diary or journal I suppose...). Hope you like what comes out of here...whatever. Enjoy, if you will!    So here goes nothing....   I decide that I should go to Wal-Mart (more commonly referred to as Wally World) and that some friends should come.   After that I go to McDonalds with Chuck while taking him home and his girlfriend, Guisante, calls me and says that she has something to talk to us about, so she comes to McD's (she was also with us at wally world, just had to take Anna to a friends house so she could go to a concert. we go swimming at Guisante's, watch a movie after that (during which I keep a close eye on them...) and go home.   Goodnight.
