My sister was not feeling well so she left before the main course. When we returned home Audra, my step sister, had a surprise party planned. We pooled our money together to buy her an Elsa Peretti platinum diamond ring from Tiffany's.  urlLink SEE THE RING HERE.  And I gave her diamond earings to match.  The  urlLink L ROEDERER CRISTAL  and mother's  urlLink favorite wine  were flowing until 1 in the morning when our guests started to leave.  My time in town was limited but I got the most out of it. I went back to Elk Grove HS to scare a few old teachers, visited with some old friends and most importantly spent time with my family.
