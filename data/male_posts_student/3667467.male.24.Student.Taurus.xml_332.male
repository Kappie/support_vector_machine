I have a policy of listening to all my records all the way through, and I must say it was a very long hour. If you've ever been in a class for a subject you have no interest in, you'll understand. "Double Vision" was okay, and though the song wasn't so good, it was fun hearing the guy say "'cuz I'm a Dirty White Boy!" I filed this CD under "F." For "Foreigner."
