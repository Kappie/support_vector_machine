Okay...yesterday was quite a boring day la. Nothing much happened. We stayed back to wait for SL, Janet and all for Bio. After that, we talked to Mrs Chua lor. She told us about O Level papers (how it is much easier than prelim's. The teachers set a more difficult paper for prelims...about 1-2 grade higher. Espeically so for Miss Tan, who sets about 3-4 grades higher). She also told us about JCs (She's from St Andrews JC. Cool!) and all. Meow!!  Well. Today's exciting. Kinda. But first, I wanna narrate something. You see, there's this whole list being passed around. This list is asking us whether we want to go chalet or not. I put not sure at first. Everybody did. And I talked to CQ you know. About how upset Wendy's gonna feel if she sees the whole list being ticked with "Not Sure"s. I almost wanted to put "Yes", but I have to see circumstances. Then, the list came back. The "Not Sure" column has been erased and everyone have to make a choice. I saw the list. CQ is not going. Okay...... Then, I saw the two most unfavourable people in the whole wide world ticking "yes" (namely, Faiz and Kim Hock.) I decided not to go in the end. Why? CQ and most of my friends are not going. And what adds salt to injury is that those two are. I got totally no one to hang around with (well, I got Wendy and Amanda....but KH is friendly with them....pah). I would rather coop myself at home then be insulted/bullied there (I got PLENTY of experiences, thank you very much). But also, I felt very guilty. I am letting Wendy down. After all, she shared her excitement and plans with me, and I was like very happy along with her. Then suddenly, I decided not to go. I owed Wendy a lot, in that sense. That expains my guiltiness. Wendy said she don't cared if I don't go. That stroke a chord in my heart. Don't care....that kinda hurts, you know. Yes. I would go to chalet, provided the two doesn't go. Being idiotic, aren't I? ...  Hm. I got back my EL grades!! It's a B4 overall! I improved in my Paper 1, scoring about 40 out 60! Woo-hoo! So, my total L1R5 would be 16! Ah Ji passed his EL! YaY!! Congrats to him! So, he got a socre of 16 too! YaY!! Good for us! Meow meow. Something idiotic happened today. It has something to do with YitHann. Yeah. You guessed it. He's being totally sucky today. Probably from getting C6 for his EL. As usual, I was the punching bag (not only that, a kicking bag too). I can't stand him! So what if he got a C6? Does it mean he have to chu qi on a person who got B4 (he was blaming XC for getting A2! HELLO! XC has every rights to get an A. So does Siva, for that matter!)? No! There's no use blaming others for being cleverer. He have only himself to blame for his own results. Such people!  Okay...I think that's it la. I don't want to say anymore things. I will elaborate further tomorrow. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.
