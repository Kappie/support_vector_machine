I DID! we also took some pictures, and after that around like 9:45, we decided to go see "white chicks" at the movies. it was an ok movie, kinda pointless, lol, but it was funny too! after that jessicas mom drove us all home around 12, and i was pooped, so i went to bed. on saturday, i stayed in my pj's all day, i didnt do anything or go anywhere. IT WAS GREAT! then on sunday (the 4th of july) i got together with kenny and nat at the park, and we hung out there for a while with our kool sunglasses...lol, j/k! and we took some pictures and we just had a good time. after that we went to the yokayo pool with kenny and his family, and im the only one who didnt swim, i felt kinda bad about it, but i just wasnt in the swimming mood. it was fun tho, cause we did other stuff. (by the way, kenny, u need a smaller swimsuit!, lol, j/k) anyways, after all that, we went to nats house to watch the fireworks and we took more pics with nats camera, only kenny and nat ruined it...and they know what i mean! lol! we were all gonna spend the night on kennys lawn, but nat couldnt, so me and kenny slept in a tent on his front lawn, it was fun. and in the morning we had belgian waffles! and kenny only ate like 3 or 4...im seriously worried! after that we hung out in his front yard on his driveway in our pj's and we looked like bums! we called nat and we were gonna do something, but nats sister got her in trouble, so we didnt. my dad came and picked me up from kennys, and kenny said he would call and we would try and get nat to do something with us later...but he never did...what a flake! lol, j/k with ya buddy! anyways, that was my weekend, prolly one of the best ones for a really long time!
