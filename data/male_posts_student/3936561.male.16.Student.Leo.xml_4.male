Yup, that means I'll be reading  The Lazarus Effect  (sequel to   The Jesus Incident ) while I watch people give me money for pieces of my childhood. In other news, two cool things about Half-Life mods:  Science and Industry  version 1.0 finally came out, if you have Steam you can DL it at  urlLink http://www.planethalflife.com/si . Just choose the full install from free.fr and you'll be fine. And I discovered the mod Monkey-Strike. You have to read aboutit ( urlLink http://monkeystrike.com ). Later!
