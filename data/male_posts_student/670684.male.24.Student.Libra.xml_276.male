"If this was all I the drama I dealt with, life would be so easy."  Of course that is a lie...this is perfect because I can recharge my battery for it over the school year.  I haven't talked to my mom or my grandparents or friends that have called really since I got here.  I knew that is how it would be...it's not that I don't care, it's just that my time on the job coencides with their time off work, and when I get off work, I want to sleep, not make phone calls.  I look like an ass to them all, and I don't like that.    David got my files back!  So now I sit with my Barnes  Noble impulse buys, feeling good but realizing how much money I dropped.  The girl at Barnes  Noble was quite attractive...jet black cropped hair, nose ring, pink tank top with chinese zodiac symbol...but she was an all business worker.  I dropped $25 on a Readers Advantage card because she mentioned that it would make my prices cheaper, but what it did was add $15 to my total price.  So if I drop $150 more at B (possible), I'll make back the money.  She told me why it was, and had very short conversation with me, and I think she was a bit interested in a slightly more than pedestrian way (and if you can get a hot girl who works in service to show interest in you, it's quite the accomplishment).  But her demeanor was all professional...she was interested in making Barnes  Noble money.  That's cool, but not attractive to me.  Be kind of flimsy, be a rebel a bit...but then you're giving up power, and when you have to fight to be considered for more than your body, any loss of power will require great lengths to get it back.    Maybe I'll see her when I return the books tomorrow.  I'm taking two back...I bought them with that Amazon gift certificate that never got used because Amazon duped me.  They came in handy here, where I was able to save $35 by buying through them rather than Barnes  Noble.  They'll be sent to Duke, where I start on Monday.  I won't have the other three finished by then.    Wow, I will really miss these kids come Saturday.  I never had a little brother or sister.  I see Daniel Young interact so well with his sister Laura and brother David, and try to be a good influence on them, and I just wish I had someone I could do that with, show the ropes to and try to help out of sticky situations like my sister did with me towards the end of our high school careers.  I've got 35 right now, most of whom I have a good or great rapport with.  And Chris had it right, we won't know each other again come Saturday.  Sure, I'll see one or two maybe...maybe one will end up at another TIP camp (this will become a regular summer thing for me, no doubt), maybe someone will need a recommendation letter, and there will be awkward emails and IMs and the like, but this is it for living a life like this, where we know each other as well as we do.  I had some great camps in my days...this will end up in that same capacity.
