A few days ago, one of my [often] month-long waves of depression started and I just haven't been in the mood to do anything that I don't HAVE to do to not get my ass kicked in a major way. In any event, sorry everyone. I've been add the raw stuff you saw earlier to a file and I think I'll just not be such a self-pitying pussy and post something I find interesting sometime soon.  That is all. -- Feanor
