N if Cleal wasnt offside, MANLY wuld have come home full strong n stormed ova dem...Just 1 metre offside...Afta dat, i think Manly let Parra have a few pts cos dey for/agenst was a bit worse for away...  52-12 was not a true representation...  Harris played well n so did Donald. Stewart n Beaver had a quiet one...but dw next week well slaughter da Rabbitohs n hang dem on da Chinatown kao dian hooks.   WE will b bak...
