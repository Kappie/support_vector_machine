And I can say that as long as the chain of sick events don't continue, my sick sick mind would soon not be so sick anymore. And I can say that things have been looking up, talked to Ben and that made my day. And it also has to do with the post which I wrote, i mean hey, is the first time i used the F word in my blog, out of 70 posts? and almost 30000 words later. But I'll see how things go on Monday to judge whether they'll be any recurrence of posts like that.  But, I guess you won't be seeing that in a while. Even though I consider the F word an art in itself, its an icing on the cake of english though, too much would give you diabetes and make you sick, but a smattering of it would definitely make the cake much nicer. I see it as something poetic, anyway, Stephen King uses it, even though that chao ah beng at the void deck uses it more than him, ahh that golden haired monkey probably is as diabetic as that ant.   Anyway, yea, I have had a productive saturday today. and hey hey hey, Ruby is kinda puzzled about my personality though, so I shall summarize myself. I play guitar and listen to heavy metal but does that make me a head-banging, coke-snorting hippie? uhhhh no. I like chinese pop, but does that mean I'll wait at the airport, a week before their flight to recieve my favourite artist? again, no. I play piano and like classical music, does that make me an old fart whose seats are glued on that esplanade chair? you guessed it right, no. I am politically aware, and support quite a few causes, but do you see me in some kinda politically-laced t-shirt and going for that demonstration? no. And I like quantum/nuclear physics, as well as philosophy in short anything kinda intellectual. But does that make me a geek? hell.....no.  Anyway yea, I guess time spent outside of church is very productive and my saturday has been one of the most productive I've had by far. I've spent almost my entire evening in the library reading INTRODUCTORY (emphasis on introductory) nuclear physics and am still stuck at page 11, the whole thing about de Broglie's locality of particles got me lost in there, and the Heisenburg's uncertainty principle. As both are connected, page 11 is as far as I can go. And its only the 2nd page of the 2nd chapter which is quantum mechanics, guaranteed to be very difficult, in fact quantum physics is by far the most complex branch in physics, ever wondered why your o-level textbook does not mention anything about quarks and gluons or wave-particle duality?, now you know.  But not to fret, Yilin's friend, Simon if I'm not wrong, seems to know quite a bit as I can see a few smatterings of GUTs as well as some quantum terminologies in his blog, so I'm gonna drop him a comment or an e-mail. This is one subject I cannot do without a teacher, and the part about quantum mechanics is very very heavy on the maths, so its one uh-oh topic, but I guess I gotta know some quantum stuff if I wanna get into nuclear physics. I've made a huge bunch of notes, 4 pages to be exact as the book is a reference book, and I'm gonna spend the next day digesting it. Hopefully with some help from a mentor/s.  Anyway, on the more artistic side. I'm almost done with the FFX piano intro, the whole To Zanarkland song, its a wonderful song, paints a wonderful picture. And I went to Yamaha today, played the digital piano and its like WHAT !!!!!!!!! I can stay all day there man, its very very inspirational and I'm dying to get one, its 1500 tho, ahhhhhhhh! The sound the feel all, its like whoa.......and its like when I improvise, I can really feel the emotion everything coming out.  As for guitar, I've started on Satriani's version of Beethoven's 5th, and I can say that besides the cello or violin, it sounds great on guitar, esp. with lots of distortion. The harmonic minor is cool, really blends in without being to obtrusive. Which I have the knack, or should I say any musician which ain't that good yet, have the knack for making the harmonic minor sounds obtrusive, but definitely not Beethoven. I'm kinda inspired by classical music in all aspects of my musical life, be it piano or guitar, esp. maybe Malmsteen for guitar, and I hope to learn ALL positions and shapes of diminished, phrygian and harmonic minor, as well as some runs. Seriously, me knowledge on scales is kinda shit. Need to work on that.  And also, I'll like to work on my alternate picking and triplets, and how to use them better in the context of a fixed scale. As well as learn some more "blues chords" dominant 11ths, and the like. cos' I can do note by note blues soloing but I can say then again, my knowledge of chords is pretty limited. Besides the usual G Am F#m stuff I need to really learn more chords to give my solos more diemension, esp. on clean and new chords and voicings really help in songwriting.......  Ah guess I've written too much, today is a wonderful, but also very confusing saturday (quantum mechanics have the knack for doing that), but all in all. As I sit here typing away, I can say that I will go to sleep fulfilled.........
