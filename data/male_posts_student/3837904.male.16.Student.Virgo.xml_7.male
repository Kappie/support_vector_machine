It was going to be a boring saturday, but eventually, thanks to Harriet it wasn't just an ordinary boring saturday. The gigs at youth park was boring. Nothing much actually because the irritating josh was there. That makes it even worst. Went off halfway to have dinner in cineliesure and got myself a bottle of e33. Which was humbly shared with Harriet. Draw down to Paragon to get my new really really big wallet. Great neated and pull-up bag in black. The next stop was at Kovan interchange. Some ordinary gig, but it was a great experience. Eventually all of them were so simple. Wait till The Piggery haunts the stage. Partying and drinking section was next, but it eventually ended up in a fight. What a plesent situation it was.
