Now, people on this show have died before, but come back somehow. But this was a  serious  death. And this is a comedy anime. Excel puts her hand over the wound and looks at all the blood that's pouring out, and I'm just sitting there in awe and I'm like, "Oh my God...." *Sniff*, she was so young, and so hot. That guy she worked for is such a jerk, killing an agent of his like that. So basically, it was a serious moment in a comedy anime, and I'm anxious to see the next ep to make sure Excel's gonna be okay.... -Sane Intolerant-
