Last night there was also a discussion over something that Melissa pointed out to me in Asian Outlook. She was offended by Nick's statements about the sexism and biases in so-called culture, because of the problematizing of "culture."  Esther and Crystal agreed with Nick on some of the issues. However, Esther was annoyed in how Nick characterized things as just physical waving around of scarves. Like Melissa had said, these aren't really about "talent" as these things have to be easy enough for people to participate. There is a "cultural" aspect to it. For Esther, she feels that cultural shows spark dialogue and interest in not so much "tradition" but history. I disagree on that point on history, but I'll get back to it.  Crystal said that aspects of Korean culture are "stifling." She said she loves Korean culture, and points out it is easier to point out problems than solve it. After all these three girls of completely different Asian backgrounds, as well as myself... all find the problem of "fitting in" and culture problematic.  See the problem is, tradition is an interpretation of history, that is steeped in ideology. That's why I disagree with Esther on the issue of sparking interest in history. As Melissa pointed out, this is further complicated by immigration. We aren't Chinese, Fillipino, Taiwanese, or Korean... we're hypenated Americans. In the case of Melissa and Crystal, they're double hyphenated. Furthermore, the four of us are, as some people might say, "Twinkies." So in this context, how do we interpret history through the lenses of our identities and culture?  It is my own personal opinion that culture is what  we  make of it, because it is part of our own identities. Indeed it is hard to negotiate the difficult terrains of identity and culture, but as Satre says, "Tu n'es rien d'autre que ta vie. . . ." (You are nothing else but your life." It is ultimately up to you to live your life, and I believe that one does have enough agency to make culture to work for them. It is possible to come up with a culture that does not draw on racist, sexist, and oppressive histories. However, at the same time, people have the right to make choices and some may chose to ignore the problems in favor of the pure aesthetics of the culture.  I could go on and on forever about this, but I'll stop for now.  ***
