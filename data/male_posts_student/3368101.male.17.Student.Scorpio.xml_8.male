Today we were filling the shelves up with stock. Went well, I worked hard *wink*. However, during the day, for no reason, one of the top sheves in the wines and spirits sections collapsed, and around 15 bottles of red wine fell to the floor and smashed!  It was a mess, red wine all over the last aisle (sp?) - terrible stuff.  Anyways - I worked for around 8 hours today and I'm knackered!  There is another worker there, he's a deputy manger from another store helping out, and he told me, that at his store, an employee once accidentally threw out some important papers. He got mad, so he made the guy go into the skip, and look for them :-d. Woohoo, how great is he, he said the employee was sik within two seconds - hahaha.  Big Brother last night was good - Victor is the man. I hate Emma more than ever, she thick, dumb, clearly mentally unstable, and a racist. How dare she say to Victor, "stop acting like a black man"  Right, im off - bye.  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - Fly Away
