He was going to do an April Fool's joke-blog where he made up this story of a girl he met Thursday night and hung out with and exchanged numbers with, etc.  He was going to be very detailed and intricate but still be fun and then give his readers some false beliefs.  Either he was going to do that or do a blog where he sets himself up as being suicidal and extremely depressed (which he could pull off pretty well in this hell week he has had).  He also decided not to do that.  Instead, he is just going to say what he has already said and say ha!  So that is pretty much what Tyke's joke was going to be.  He thought of it last night and thought it would be good.  But Tyke doesn't really feel in the mood to do so.  Nor has he been in the mood to do it for quite some time.  That's kind of interesting.  Tyke had a lot of fun at Refuge this past Sunday and he was very giddy then.  Excluding Sunday though, Tyke has not been very happy since Saturday evening.  Late night Saturday he wasn't as happy either.  So basically this week has been depressive.  Not exactly sure that 'depressive' is a word-most likely isn't-but it was used strategically to convey his message.  Not depressed, not depressing, just depressive.  Like it could be depressing if it got worse.  Which it won't.  It's just another phase.  Which is kind of random to Tyke.  He really doesn't know why he has been so down this week.  It's not like this week is that different from any other.  Tyke has had to do a little bit more homework than usual but that isn't that big of a deal.  He knows what is making him sad but it isn't like he hasn't always felt that way.  For some reason it is taking it's toll on Tyke this week.  Being sick and not of healthy body must have some effect on his mind.  It is just annoying mostly.  Oh, and Tyke has also missed something for the last 2 days but he hopes to get it tomorrow.  At least once.  Let's see.  What was fun today?  Sanders (yeah, using her name for once) said poop.  It was funny.  Then Tyke kept saying poop.  Poop poop poop.  Tyke was the King in english.  He was drifting asleep after he thought he was done with his lines for the day but then he opened his book a bit as they began to read again and he realized all of a sudden that he was supposed to be reading.  So he jumped in and read.  That woke him up.  It caught him by surprise to say the least.  Actually had to stay in class 5th period for most of the day again.  That was too bad.  Did go to the bathroom though at one point.  That was a great #1.  It felt really good.  Just like the one Tyke just took.  Mmmm...good feelings.  Today is the first day of April.  Which means only 2 more months of school...after this month that is.  But yeah, that is not going to take that long either.  Which is just a mixed bag of emotions.  But you all know what that is like so no need to talk about that topic here.  This is just for brand new topics of conversation.  Yeah, right.  What a great title for a play/musical/opera/whatever the hell it is.  Les Miserables.  Less Miserables.  Tyke would like to be that right now.  Less miserables than he is now.  Ok, only one way to change that, at least that Tyke can do on his own.  And that is to eat.  Eat a lot.  And then just poop it out later.  Poop poop poop.
