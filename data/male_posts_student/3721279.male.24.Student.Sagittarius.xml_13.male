Lo, do I see behind me a half-spent summer, and before me yet another half to fill with adventures of which the bards shall sing many a tale. I see a warrior reclaiming his sword once more, a poet dreaming new tales, and endless days and nights of brotherly company and cheer. And do I yet hear the sweet words of a fair maiden filling my ears? Shall I gaze upon her beauty and know her as my lady? Only time shall tell these things.....  Okay, that's about all of the positive self-talk I can muster before work. :)  Consumers of Electronic Entertainment, I challenge thee to mortal combat! (charging into...the shower?)
