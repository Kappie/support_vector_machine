No skating, I really didn't have the energy. I know if Sandy ever sees this he won't be happy, but since unless I die suddenly none of my friends probably will see this, i can. I just sat there. I should have gone into town on Friday, but I really couldn't be bothered. Plus I had no money. So I sat in my boxers at home till about 5pm, when I decided to get dressed, cause I wanted some air. Anyway, I was offered a tenner to tidy, and seeing as I wanted to go into town with my gf, Toni, I leapt at the chance of actually having some money to go to town with. So I worked. Okay, I didn't do that much, but it was enough to get me money. However, when I was about to go, my mum had already gone, leaving my dad to cough up the money, which he had none of. So, after claiming his card, and running to the bus stop, I finally got a bus, about two minutes before I was meant to be in town. And of course it was a fucking slow bus. And two people couldn't find there tickets. I was so late that Toni, Joey and Lindsay had already gone into the film. Now, being a short arse, and only 14 anyway, I courageously attempted to buy a ticket. And failed. So Joey came to the rescue. Anyway, I got in, and while Joe and Lindsay were huddled up in the corner I watched the film. I know, and I had Joey and Ben, as well as a few other random people, on at me and Toni all fucking day. Eventually though, when she was about to get the bus home, I did it. The first thought afterwards was "Ha! Fuck You Joey!". Anyway. I'm bored, so here's a few random pictures.   This one's for Will! Lol:         :D  Anyway, I have to go now.   Tatty Bye.
