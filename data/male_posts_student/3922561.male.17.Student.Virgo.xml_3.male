As time progressed so did my depression, and I eventually turned suicidal, twice I attempted it.  I never did succeed, I don't know what turned me away, I believe it was like two different people that I didn't want to do it too.  After all of this I had to go to therapy and I still go.  I don't really think it is helping me.  And to tell you the truth I think I'm getting worse than I use to be.  I just don't know what to do.  Everything I want to happen never does, so I just don't really want to keep trying.  This may come as a shock to some people, but all throughout my life I have had to hide all the pain I was going through, so I thought it was necessary to get it out in the open, before I don't get the chance to.      how do you sleep when its still alive never to deep take a look inside
