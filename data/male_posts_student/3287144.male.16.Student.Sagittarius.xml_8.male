I'm guessing the former is where you have an imaginary job and the latter is where you pretend you work on a space ship. Maybe not.  Also I seem to be under constant attack from beetles looking rather similar to  urlLink May Beetles . While these pose no threat to my existence, I still feel it my duty to dispatch them, except I can't bare to kill the things so the result is a twenty minute chase in order to corner the thing and then send it out through the window and hope that it managed to survive the fall. I worry too much.  Anyway, I better do some  more  revision. It's all good.
