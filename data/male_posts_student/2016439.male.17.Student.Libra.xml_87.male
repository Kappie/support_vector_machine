I woke up especially early (10:10) to make sure I caught you, but in fact I only saw you as you flittered away into the cool breeze that made the crape myrtle trees giggle so much that their beautiful pink and white flowers fell to the ground. I went to get the mail, but my mother had already got it. I took the time to look around at the peaceful street without the annoying honking of electric scooter horns and at the concrete driveways with dying leaves flittering across them, as if making their last stand before death. You were sweet to me this morning, so I want you to come back and visit us some time. You're always welcome.
