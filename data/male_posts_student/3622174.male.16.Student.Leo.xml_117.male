Part of it has to do with me having continuous chores around the house, when my brother and sister just sit on their asses all day doing absolutely nothing.  Part of it has to do with one particular person, and I'm not going to say anymore about that.  And part of it has to do with my brother complaining that I have one of his videogames, despite me tearing apart my bedroom looking for it, and did not find it.  I really just want to get away, take a break, and recover from this "worst summer ever." And I can't do that until July 19th, when I leave for Yearbook Camp.  I just hope my fellow staffers are ready to deal with a perkier David, because it'll probably be one of the rarest occasions now when I'll be in a good mood.  What really sucks about my life coming up is the fact that my brother is going to be coming to my school, and that's just going to suck.  He has got the worst attitude, thinking that he is better than everyone else.  He thinks he's just going to make my senior year the worst thing that ever happened to me, thinking that he can pick on a senior.  He's got another thing coming.  But, if anyone does anything to him, of course, my parents are going to yell at me for it, since it will probably be one of my friends that does it to him in the first place.  I'm absolutely going to hate my senior year, despite what he does or doesn't do.    I wanna go fall asleep for a while, hopefully I'll be in a better mood for some Late Night Bloggin', but, if not, don't blame me.
