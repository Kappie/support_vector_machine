It wasn't the last vote to take place though, as early as next week there will be another attempt to ban gay marriages. So, you can definately be assured that next week I'll fight just as hard. So anyway, yesterday I didn't really do much I just read some more on that book, im almost done now only 50 pages to go! Jeanne is going to read the book too when I finish it. It's really good, boring at times but I feel A LOT smarter reading it. I learned several new governmental phrases I LOVE IT! lol You know I wouldn't be suprised if I shy away from the whole computers career thing because as of late I've been extremely political and I'm starting to like it, one day I want to make a difference in this country. Well, that's it for now, I have a doctor's appointment to go to!
