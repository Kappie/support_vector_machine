Just to let everyone know, tenting really isn't that great.  I say this because this was my first time tenting in all the times that my family went camping.  For the past who knows how long we've had a 29 foot pull type travel trailer that we went camping in but we sold it because we stopped using it that much.  The experience as a whole was rather good though, a sort of back to the basics journey.  I fished on Leech River and caught one very nice bass and about six good sized northerns.  The important thing about this trip is that I found out that I need a good sized hunting knife.  Or a small broadsword.  Either one.  It's really hard to peel the bark off of a branch with your fingers.  So one of these days I'll have to go to that little sword/taser shop that Mattson goes to and find one.  I can see what Jefe means about not being invited to anything.  I just started to get into the mix and Jefe has almost done less things than I have.  July 13th is slowly getting closer.  Drivers test.  I will finally be able to drive and not be stuck with Mattson all of the time(not implying that it's a bad thing).  So. . .that's all I did. . . later.           "sometimes you got to whip out all you got. . .and do it in the butt!"
