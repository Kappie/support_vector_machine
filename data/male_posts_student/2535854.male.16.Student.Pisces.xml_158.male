Appearently Rachel`s birthday party was last night and Aaron  co. went and didn`t come to school...relatively peaceful today...Well anyway school was a bore..accounts is turning into a blackhole for me...and yes I slept in Agama class just now.Heh.  After school I had a dentist appointment and I hear I need a few teeth extracted =0! Yikes...anyway my teeth hurt now...there`s now more brackets on the back teeth and stuff..pretty much like having a ring for all of them back there now. Anyway there was some Listerine cheap-0 price promo and like I ave 3 big bottles of Listerine and like 6 or 8 small bottles and 3 pocket pack mints. Yay!  Then went by err whats that place called...ahh SmartConneXtion in Bangsar..that new clothes shop..like some Giodano copy if you ask me..heh..anyway there was a 30% sale there so got some shirts..heh..and my original purpose was to look for black trousers.haha. got a  Maroon V-Neck   and a   navy blue shirt.   Also got a grey coloured t-shirt since if I spent another rm20, i`d get a free unbrella. Haha..Not that thers none at home but why not :p...   Well I was a good boy when I went home and finished up all my homework..and oh dear!look at the time! its 10:30pm...sounds perfect for catching lots of sleeping time!
