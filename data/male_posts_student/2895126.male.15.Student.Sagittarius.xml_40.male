Believe it or not, I actually felt like listening to some rock after I was done, and that is  quite  a feat. Jack Black was hilarious, the kids were good, and I think it's overall one of the top five movies I've ever seen, counting the entire LoTR series as one, of course. I give it:  5 stars . If you haven't yet, see it yourself.  Next post I'll review " urlLink The Fifth Element ," a science fiction flick starring Bruce Willis.   Esse quam videri.  (To be rather than to seem.)
