Neway, nag-mass kami sa Santuario de San Antonio ni RenRen and my aunt and then we went to G4 to watch Mean Girls. It was so cool and so funny, as in! Lindsay Lohan is such a sexy bitch and all the other mean girls were really fugly sluts...=)   And then, when we finally went home to our shelter, we were so glad na hindi pa tapos yung Ateneo-La Salle game and we were still able to scream our lungs out (GET THAT BALL! GET THAT BALL!).    And then of course, the moment of truth came when Ateneo finally won over the archers! 72-75! Close fight talaga! Pero well, I guess the better team won...hihihihi...thanks to Fonacier and Tenorio who really saved the Ateneo ass. We weren't there but we really felt like we were there, especially when Mar Roxas was cheering proudly while wearing his trademark blue polo..i mean, the school spirit was just so ecstatic!    Anyway, Sunday was really a great day!   P.S. Watch mean girls. It is the best comedy this year!
