Sarah's presentation on  Oxyen  was really good. It might have been better if it wasn't Avril Levigne the one that was featured with her, but anyway. I think Dido or someone else with a similar music would've been the choice. Still, if could skip that part, Sarah's performance was excelent. I wish she'd played "Stupid" live, is such a song, or maybe "Answer", people, you have to hear that song. It goes along the path of "I love you" ... just excelent.  Check MSNBC, there's a kind o review:  urlLink McLachlan basks in ‘Afterglow’
