Here's a list of all the changes I've added:   1)  Added Links.   2)  Added MoBlog updaters for Leoville, Morgan's Webb, Sarah, and Kevin.   3)  Added Events.   4)  Looking for a good free javascript calendar (events could be more organized).   ---  In other events, I will be out of town on vaction through the week of August 16th (August 16th - 21st).  I will not be back until late Saturday, August 21st.    To family members: If you need to get in touch with me while I am gone, I will email you my cell phone number.  Email me at astaro@alltel.net.  Nick, I want you to keep an eye out on my blog while I'm gone.  I'm going to make a separate password so you can log into my account.  Please call me tomorrow and I'll tell you what it's going to be.  Feel free to make modifications to the template if you like.  I will save a backup of my template so don't worry about messing anything up.  My news (in my own words) will be postponed.  Also Nick... I need to talk to you about doing the news if you would... I would be much appreciative.
