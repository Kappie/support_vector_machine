I cannot believe how completely, utterly and hopelessly addicted I am to Texas Hold 'Em.  The only thing this compares to is my addiction to Magic back in 1998.  It is such a simple game, but the possibilities are overwhelming, and most of the game happens outside of the cards.  My brother Mark turns out to be a poker fiend, probably playing more than is healthy.  But I envy him for that.  We played this past weekend in Toledo, with our dad and uncle.  For the record, Mark took all of the money.  If you are interested in screwing around with the game, I recommend www.partypoker.com for a free site to play with fake money.  You could easily loose a few hours pushing cards around.
