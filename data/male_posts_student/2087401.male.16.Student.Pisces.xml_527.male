And Sarah and I were talking, and we want to have a double journalcon with the sushi people at some point.  Some of them are interested in meeting some of you or something. Paul, that is a strange project indeed, but I have a master plan to make mine awesome. Today's match-up.  11 1/2 vs the square root of an orange.  11 1/2 is armed with happiness, and the square root of an orange is clad in swiss cheese.  They are playing psychological death handball by notation. The results of the last match, which was kept a secret for government reasons, is that General Brooks won, but the Easter Bunny was darn close.  Everything else is classified. So, that's about it.   I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
