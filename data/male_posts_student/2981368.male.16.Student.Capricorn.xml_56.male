What a vague sentence. Meh well. We managed to get 2 done each in 3 hours work, including cleaning up the shop and having a v. long break. Which involved everyone messing around with one of those big gas canisters of helium. I swear, it was like having the Smiths around the place.   Of course, after all that work putting these damned things together, they all fell apart when we had to move them into better positions around the outside area. Like, half the bits were actually attached. So anyone who buys one (they're Â£129.99 *bwahahaha*) really needs their head examined. And should probably be locked away in a home for the criminally insane.  Today was pretty fun. Long lie in, until woken up by dog barking at bloody birds. Afternoon, walked up to the Lesiure Centre with Joe and played badminton. Hot day for once, and they had all those fat industrial heaters on full blast, so nearly died *urgk*. Then sorta walked round those fields where the circus goes trying to find a way into Mundy Playing Fields. Failed, and managed to scare some kids walking along that random road by appearing from over a wall carrying raquets 'n' all. Amazingly, in about 1h 30mins of tennis, we both managed to play fairly well, despite not having played for about a year. Woooohoooo-ness. Left early to get home in time for dinner, but ended up being late by talking to Jack for aaaaages. Then played ping pong till about 9, while discussing a great marketing idea, which i'm gonna post seperately. For the sake of it.  EDIT: OK, its too sick an idea. So I'm not gonna post it. But if you reeeeally wanna know all about it, let me know and I'll tell ya. I just think its a bit...erm...grim to post here. And would probably just offend someone.
