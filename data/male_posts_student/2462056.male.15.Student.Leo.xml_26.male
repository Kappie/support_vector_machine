I got up this morning around 10:30, then about an hour later I had a bass lesson, which was cool.  I learned Play The Funky Music, cuz we are working on slapping and popping.  I came home from that, ate some pizza, then I listened to music for like, a really long time, watched some TV, lazied around.  Later tonight I went with my sister over to our neighbors to water plants because they are out of town, and that turned into a big hose war, we both ended up soaked, so it was fun.  Came home, ate dinner... now I'm here listening to music and talking to ANNE! Who I haven't talked to in forever.   Yep, so Claire still isn't home, and NOTHING has gone on for a while... I'm so crazy excited about Warped Tour, I need to hurry up and order my tickets, I'll probably do it with Ben so we will get them at the same time.  So yep, that's it..
