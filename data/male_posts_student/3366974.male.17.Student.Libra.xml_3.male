Well, I read a bit of Moby Dick today and a little yesterday. Speaking of yesterday, oops! Didn't make a post, I forgot. Wasn't anything worth telling about anyways. I got to thinking, maybe it isn't a good idea to post every day anyways because I'd have 365 posts a year, and that is a lot of damn posts. But, I guess it only shows a week worth at a time. So, hmm.   I went back to the doctor's today, and the verdict is this: I must start taking the full 25 MG pill, instead of half a pill (12.5 MG). That's basically it, exciting isn't it?  I went to the fair with Bob, and after walking around for an hour or so we left. I saw some people I knew, but were the stuck up preps. So, basically the fair sucked.
