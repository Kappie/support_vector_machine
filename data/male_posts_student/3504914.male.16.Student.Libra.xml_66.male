I bought a bunch of dvds xD A list? YOU WANT A LIST?! You don’t? I’m giving it anyway xD   -	Joe Satriani live in San Francisco -	G3- Live in Denver (This is just so fucking awe-inspiring; I can’t put it into any other words. I spent the afternoon watching it and I was put into tears by the fucking beauty of Vai, Satriani, and Malmsteen performing together at the end)  -	Santana’s  Supernatural   -	Pink Floyd’s  The Wall   -	The Fisher King   Well, it’s a bunch for me xD   Guess what I’ve been reading, on my own liberated will?  The Art of Happiness  by Howard C. Cutter and His Holiness The Dalai Lama. I’ve been thinking about shifting my religion to Buddhism, since I can sincerely say I feel about it strongly, the concepts and such. The fascinating thing about the Dalai Lama is that he doesn’t segregate things into good or evil; it’s either positive or negative. You wonder what’s the difference? Well, he classifies it into whether it’s positive or negative in the quest for happiness. I’ve digested a lot in the two days I’ve been reading this, and though I hate the guy who writes it, I become spellbound with His Holiness’ words.   Ah well, I thought I’d never see the day where I confirm to any religion, but if I do, it will be to Buddhism, and it will be quite soon. Odd really. xD   Anything I want to add? Hmm, I’ve been thinking about relationships a lot while reading this book. The Dalai Lama states that most of the time people get into relationships for pleasure, not happiness, and this is pretty much true. He also states pleasure can be bad in the long run, also true. Whenever a girl complains about breaking up with some bloke because he’s an arse, my mind is urging me to tell her to shut the fuck up and tell her it’s because she chose the wrong dude. Of course, I shouldn’t, and I don’t think I have.   This leads me to choosing the wrong girls, and it is ALWAYS for the wrong reason xD I can say this after honestly looking over my past. I’ve always wanted the wrong type of girl, and for the wrong reasons. I was a suicidal-want—to-be for a year or so, and I sought relief and I thought I could only find it in intimacy with a chick in the way Hollywood so amazingly visualises. This was so horrid I didn’t come to think about sharing a regular kind of intimacy you can find in just normal friends. Therefore I spent a lot of my time agonised, when really I shouldn’t have been. Falling in ‘love’ with some superficial girl is like smoking, it’s a brainless compulsion which needs quitting.   I’m shallow; I’ll be the first to admit it. I have a classification system which goes  elephant lady  meaning  wouldn’t fuck her if I was stone drunk , to  fuckable  where she isn’t great, but she’d be alright in the sack, and then finally  Triple S- Sexy, Smart, Sweet , aka the  perfect girl . I will look at a person; notice every single flaw in their face and body within around two-five seconds. I remember when I was hanging out with some of the other guys I know that I saw this chick who they thought was hot and I pointed out that she had a strange chin compared to her forehead, or something. I didn’t know what she was like in terms of personality, but I blew her out of my mind because of a small facial blemish.   Now, today, when I was in the mall with Zio, I couldn’t help but smile at some of the girls that I had previously classified as one step short of being fuckable. I don’t know why, but I just felt a lot better about myself, and I couldn’t help but feel kinder to others. Then when I was about to leave home, my uncle who was picking me up didn’t come for around 40 minutes. Last time this happened I blew my head, consuming myself in rage. Today? I just smiled and studied the place around me, the faces of some of the people I saw. When he got to me, finally, he apologised and I just said “Its alright” smiled, and shrugged it off.   This change is great simply because I feel better as a whole. I noticed people looking in a “fuck-you” way in the parking lot, I really didn’t care. If they don’t want to look at me as just another person, fine, not my problem, I tried not being a cunt and giving him a glare, you can’t ask much more.         Funny how I can change so much just because I put my mind to it. I hated that “How to be a Happy teen” because it was superficial advice. Made no sense to me. Eastern wisdom is so much more developed than Western, despite the fact it seems all Western countries developed technologically faster. Ah, I’ll shut up now, I’m babbling xD   Peace out my brothers and sisters!  That sounds silly, but I don’t careeeeeeee
