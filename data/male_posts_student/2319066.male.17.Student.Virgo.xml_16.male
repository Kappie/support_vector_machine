Friday night I was going to go to the state finals, but my mom decided that the weather was going to turn to bad, so I didn't.  So now Laura is saying that I ditched her.  It was my mom's fault, i wanted to go.  So, instead of going to state the next day I went down to Fairland to see Laura, only I got lost and got there really late.  She got mad and went shopping with her mom.  So, when I got there she was not home, and then I went home.  My mom made go back down and apologize to her, so we went out to Greenwood.  It was ok, Greenwood isn't much fun.  I also learned that Fairland truly is little.  I was happy to see Laura.  Got home around midnight, the traffic was horrible.  That is all.  See ya.
