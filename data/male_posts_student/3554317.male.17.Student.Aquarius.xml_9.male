Yesterday I purchased the latest issue of Newtype USA.  Lots of good stuff such as a Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat poster and a Di Gi Charat DVD.  Can't wait for Ghost In The Shell 2 to hit theaters here in the U.S. this fall.  I am also looking forward to the Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex which looks very interesting.    On another note, Smarty Jones lost the Belmont Stakes today in a huge upset.  I'm not a big fan of horse racing, but I knew if Smarty Jones won, it would've been a big deal.  Blah...Not looking forward to Finals this coming week starting Tuesday.  Oh well, all I can do is try my best.  ..See you next time, space cowboy.
