(or "wats new" in some of your cases) i have to direct you to a link first..   urlLink http://www.popcap.com/index.php   then.. scroll down abit.. click on the game '  Insaniquarium  ' and wait for it to load.. (click yes when they ask you to install something)  check out the descriptions.. this game is a tad lame.. but damn fun.. (especially in the later stages)  " feed your fish and watch them grow, then click on the shit they drop to fund yourself.. " -description of the game by reviewer Beng.  this is a two way game.. feed your fish with love, and with the love they recieve, they will love you back, in terms of 'shit' (that is actually money) and since you love your fish so much.. u have to fight back the aliens that invade your tank.. with love again.. (the love of slamming your left mouse button at an alarming speed that would make bishi bashi champs proud)  this is what i meant by a 'love making session'.  wat did you think it was? sex? drugs? or an orgy?   you ppl think too far..     back to the preview..  the game starts simple.. u are provided with 2 fishes.. (guppies actually.) then u jus feed them.. left click in the aquarium to drop a piece of.. shit-like fish food and your guppies will eat it up  IF  they are hungry.. feed them more and they will grow to medium size.. and start dropping money.. the fishes can grow up to 3 times..  later stages have u fighting all sorts of alien invasions who want nothing more than to gobble, missile, gobble again or jus plain irritate your fish to death.. from aliens that look like robots that fires homing missiles at your fishes.. to aliens that want nothing more than to eat ALL your fishes up.. you can actually combat them by clicking on them (to death, im not kidding). clicking on them has the effect of firing lasers at them.. (or in one special case, feed it with fish food). i wont spoil too much of the game to you.. play on to find out.  the main objective of the game is to save up money to buy 'egg pieces' that appear in your purchase menu.. once you buy 3 pieces, the current level ends and the egg will hatch into a 'pet'. these pets will help you in a variety of ways.. from a reproducing guppy mother, to an undead fish, to combat underwater creatures, and money catchers.. and a few more. to find out what the rest is, jus play :) its fun really!  there are many upgrades too. you start off only being able to have only one food piece onscreen at anytime, you can upgrade to a maximum of 9 food pieces onscreen and the food itself can be upgraded twice, to provide more 'nutrients' with each upgrade..  for me, the fun part comes when the later parts has the more fun pets and the more interesting fishes.. fishes like the flowerhorn "luo han" fish, to potions that transform fishes to golden fishes, to star-catching 'octopuses'.. its very interesting to populate your tank with such fishes and watch the constant barrage of money.. i had a 'star shower', a 'the sky is dropping money (at an insane rate)' and of course 'diamond mania! (diamonds were popping up and falling down)' i was too busy clicking like a madman trying to pick up ALL cash.. trust me on one thing, after you finish the game, you will wonder how many times you clicked the damned mouse.. the game can get VERY hectic and insane later.. its very  very   very   very     very         fun.. i highly recommend it... i killed like 3 hours on the game... before i went on with my life.. (eating lunch and writing this blog) =X yes it is that addictive too.. (kudos to eunice for intro-ing the game to me)       me and my sis was shouting many things the whole afternoon, like "tua eng kong", "stop farting lah you $^!", "die you stupid alien", "AAAIIEEEE! my fishes!!!", "feed feed! money there!!!" and many more..  try the damn game.. my declaration of love comes up next..   LOVE MAKING IS GREAT! I  LOVE   IT!!     I LIKE MAKING LOVE!!  love making damn song ;) i cant get this morning out of my mind *winks* =D ( you get my meaning dont you? =P)  one more thing i really gotta splash is Magister Negi Magi (Mo Fa Lao Shi) 6 is out, and the book is AWESOME! the fight scenes are damn tense and had a firm grip on my sights and attention non stop... damn nice sia =D but i went down yesterday and today to cp to find Get Backers 26 to no avail.. wasted 2 trips =X when is it gonna come out~~ *gripes*  i dun wanna talk too much.. or else alot of ppl will complain my blog is too damned long... =X also got a very big headache after making so much love this morning... so gonna sign sign off~!  P.S : I love my lao po(s)..  P.P.S : *turns back* watcha lookin at? i was refering to my fishes!!!  P.P.P.S : Ok i love you ppl too.. *winks* ;)  R.P.S : Did you notice that most of my blog titles were VERY suggestive? =P *take a close look*  Note: oh yea.. if any of you wants to post a comment, kindly leave your name or some detail of you.. some comments i can guess (as i asked them to take a look and they did leave a comment) but others.. like the recent one "you are gonna be named T.O.T - Takeshi of Temasek".. leave me totally clueless.. -.- and who ohhhhhs like that.. and is from TP.. hm... =X (whos Takeshi anyway, sorry i dun watch tv.. =X) Please keep the comments coming otherwise, i get entertained for at least 5 secs (average) per comment ;) I also truly appreciate and enjoy ANY feedback.
