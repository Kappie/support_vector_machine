It very well might not be exaggeration.  Tyke just yawned now even.  Today though was a great day.  Tyke got screwed in math and got one of the two worst new seats in the class and just had to sit there for a long time.  But then 2nd period was fun.  Tyke had some people talk to him as he was walking to class which is always fun cuz it is unexpected cuz it's from people he doesn't normally talk to.  Like this one junior girl who really liked his pink shirt yesterday has been talking to him a lot the past week and seems to think he's pretty cool which makes Tyke feel good, even though she has a boyfriend so it's not like she likes him.  Well, seh could but odds are not.  But now she talks with Tyke about a lot of things and whenever she sees Tyke somewhere she goes out of her way to say hi or say something to him and that is nice.  Like after school she yelled at Tyke to have a great weekend from approximately 58 feet away while walking with her boyfriend.  Oh, here's something that Tyke doesn't super like about his blog.  Whenever he mentions something like this that has to do with a girl he always seems to get at least one person who thinks that now Tyke has a thing for the girl.  Well, that usually isn't true.  That impression just comes because Tyke takes a little bit of time to mention some fun stuff that happened and since often she is the only girl Tyke talks about that day, it seems like he is developing a crush on her.  Let's just squash that idea that Tyke has a crush on this girl.  There.  That's done.  But anyway, Tyke played Bump in Weight Training again today and he is really good of course.  The junior girl always talks about how she has to beat Tyke at Bump in order to make her junior year a success so today she finally did beat him.  And it wasn't like Tyke let her.  She just beat him.  Then in 3rd period they were forced to watch Not Without My Daughter which is a pretty sad movie but Tyke doesn't want to be watching that 2 days after the AP test when he could be watching Rounders or something like that or even just sitting and talking.  But after that class Tyke went to 4th period where he acted out Waiting for Godot and did his Lucky soliloquy.  That shit was weird.  No punctuation at all.  Odd.  Then they went to Pie for lunch.  And in 5th period Tyke had a sub.  So he took attendance and then left.  He went to Kinker's class for a while and they played some Trivial Pursuit trivia with each other and then watched some SNL skits.  Then Tyke took Kinker's bag to his car and put it there so Kinker didn't have to carry it.  Tyke talked with a few people before seeing Purdy walking back to school so he went over to here and they walked around together.  Then they saw Haras and talked for a bit before walking to the senior courtyard and sitting together in the sun.  Karla came out and made some friendly chit-chat (sounds funny) but then class was over.  So they went to 6th period.  Tyke pretended that he was HoChyt for attendance and said he was here and then he was himself also, if that makes sense.  Then he called HoChyt and told him he didn't need to come to class cuz they had a sub.  Later on in the most boring of movies, HoChyt came in and said that he was from ASB and needed to get out Tyke Turner, Purdy McHot, and Kinker for some reason that Tyke doesn't remember now.  So the sub let him and then they just left.  Then Tyke and Purdy walked around more and dropped her bag off in Tyke's car for after school.  Then they went back into the sun and sat in it for the rest of the school day before finally leaving.  And then Tyke went home to change and go down to South Cove for some bball with Amed, Maniak, Jew, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon.  It was cool and Tyke seems to be starting to get a little bit of a tan from playing so many basketball games without a shirt on.  That is a good thing cuz Tyke is pretty white.  Then Tyke came home and basically was asleep until 8 with dinner in the mix there and watching some NBA games on TV as well.  Then he was so tired he didn't want to do anything at night but tomorrow he is gonna go tux shopping/searching with Amed among other things.  So time for ice cream, milk, and ESPN now.  Bye all.  Hope all those in Lake Wenatchee are having fun, like Purdy.
