It's all "work in progress" stuff but if we manage to coordinate university efforts and our project efforts we might just turn some heads. It stared as a project in Software Engineering and in the end we got 30/30. It's not even in alpha so we are estimating around 2 moths of efforts before some release. If someone is interested it's  urlLink http://www.sigmalab.net/
