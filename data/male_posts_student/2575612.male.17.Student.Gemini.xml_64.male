And breathing is a foreign task  and thinkings just to much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.  This is incredible, Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well you'd like to think that your were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time? well this is the last time. This is the last time, This is the last time.
