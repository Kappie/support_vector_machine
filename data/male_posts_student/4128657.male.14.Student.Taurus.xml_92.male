When we left it was 63 degrees.  All of our flights were on time and we arrived in Green Bay about 10:20.  We finally found a room earlier today at the Sleep Inn in DePere, WI--only a few miles south of the Green Bay airport.  We finally found out why it was so difficult to get a room--the desk clerk, Tony, who is an IM native and former IMHS teacher, told us it Family Packer weekend-over 48,000 tickets have been sold!!  When we arrived in Green Bay it was 63 degrees and the forecast is for a record low tonight of 47 degrees.  It is also forecasted to be a warm, sunny day with highs in the low 70s.  Just wanted to let everyone now our trip has started smoothly--oh, except I forgot my tootbrush!!  (But, the Sleep Inn is right next to Super Walmart!!
