I PROMISE to update as often as I can now because I'm wasting my hosting.  Been recording loads of cool stuff with Chris n James n Kayla etc.  I think I'll start some revising this week, after all, we got these 'big' (so they say) tests which start on the Wednesday back.  I'm thinking of changing the template for this blog too, and I'll get the gallery back online shortly!  Gotta go now, I'm starting to get tired... NOT.  This is the Easter Holidays!  Bed time does not exist!  I'm going anyway mwahaha...  Boo
