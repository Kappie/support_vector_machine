People just weren't in the party mood.  Dharini had been gone a while and wanted to talk to sarah, so that's what she did almost the whole time. I guess they're pretty close, so i understand, but we're her friends too! heh, it's ok. It wasn't as bad as i make it sound. It was nice to see dharini and nicole who'd been gone almost all summer. I would retype it to sound better, but i have a cyst. well, i'll stop rambling now. bye.
