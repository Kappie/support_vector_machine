The  urlLink House of the Dead   movie reflects my earlier point that most film adaptations of video games are really just an effort by the director to demonstrate to the world just how much wang he or she can cram into his or her mouth at a given time. The thing that makes me laugh here would have to be (well, among others) Jurgen Prochnow's characters' name.... He's the Captain of a Boat. He's name is Victor Kirk. Yes, indeed, that makes him Captain Kirk. BWA-AHAHAAHAHAHAHAH.   Saw Bart and Anita and Rennie and Jen Cole today. They're all doing well. Got to sit down with Bart and Anita as I finished my lunch pita. That was nice. Apparently my drink had an engery booster in it, much akin to dumping speed in my beverage. I must admit, I've typed this entry in a fraction of the time that it usually takes whilst simultaneously cooking dinner and coming up with the roadway to world peace.   meh, all for now, more later!
