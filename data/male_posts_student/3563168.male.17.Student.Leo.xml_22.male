I know the picture of him is a little young, but this guy is a total badass. I mean, not only is he one of the richest people on the planet, but he also owns his own helicopter and has a jewel encrusted apartment. I mean, how does it get better than that? The answer is that it doesn't.  Anyone who is famous for firing people is amazing. Most celebrities are washed up, sappy, boring cry babies that get too much attention. Mainly you can see they gain fame for winning reality TV shows, being fashion designers, or sneaking into things like the Oscars. Donald Trump completely dwarfs them, because he's famous for being so damn rich and totally awesome.  If you don't believe me, then Donald Trump is probably sending his own personal SWAT team to your house right now to come and take you and erase everyone's memory of your existence. (Some people may not believe the memory erasing thing, but Donald Trump has so much money, you wouldn't believe what he has.)
