Not any blue though, it's er... baby blue. I look ridiculous, nobody will take me seriously this way! And I didn't choose it, it's my dentist just randomly select for me.  okay chatting with jean now. She sent me a pic of Li lin at junction at, they probably went out there after going to CJC oogling at guys. (jeanie reports that everyone were nerds there, so I guess the li lin's hopes were dashed eh?) In any case, I opened the pic, and I began a staring competition with li lin. She won.  Oh  and the hateful tagboard is gone. Get out. Get out of my site right now.
