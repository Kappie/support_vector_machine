    
       
      I stay awake at night My sleep is what I fight For I am not ready to see What my hidden thoughts may be For that is what dreams reveal The things you try to conceal Deep in the mind they dwell Confines of personal hell But they are things no one will know For deep into my mind, no one shall go.
