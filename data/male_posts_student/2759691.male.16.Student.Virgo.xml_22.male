Somtimes calling Africa "a great nation," or otherwise butchering the English language in general, he has always managed to make it a field day for the late night comics and the like. Well, this time when President Bush inagurated another of of his "bushims" he sparked a firestorm of laughter. What he said was so "out there" that it made Jay Leno's monolouge in  The Tonight Show . I'll let you judge yourself:    Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people,  and neither do we .   (GEORGE W. BUSH,  urlLink WHITE HOUSE )      So, besides creating the next political ad for your rival, what could be  more  embarassing? If the quote is still up on your website! Yes, as of today  urlLink the quote is still up on the White House's official website . And all this after it's made the late night comedy shows. You know, Kerry should just sit back and relax from now on and let President Bush do all his campaigning.
