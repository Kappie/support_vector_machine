Actually there should be many, governed by a central and regulatory body called OFWARK.  in the club we will meet and try and do her accent and then once we realise that all we can do is say certain words a bit like billy connolly we'll think of something else to do.  at the moment of course "we" is actually just me, sitting alone in my room, pretending to be kirsty wark.  join me.
