So I learned some useful phrases:  May nobyo na ba kayo? Pwede ba kitang halikan? LOL! I'm going to get in trouble I think! ;)  Why the Aetas distrust people wearing military clothes:  I can understand now why the Aetas feel uncomfortable around the military because during the Marcos regime, many Aeta tribal leaders simply 'disappeared.' Also, three-way skirmishes between the Philippine Army, the Prolitariat Revolutionary Army, and of course the New People's Army with the Aeta caught in the middle (innocent by-standers to be sure that are caught in the crossfire). I was told back in March, 100 NPA patrolled by the village where I will be going. Although the NPA didn't cause any trouble, they were asked to leave by the village chief and the NPA agreed to. Two days later the military was in force in the area searching for the NPA. Two days after that, the military and NPA forces fought. The outcome; 20 dead (5 of them innocent civilians). Also the Aeta are constantly raided with their weapons being taken away. These rifles that are confiscated are used for hunting which leaves them very little in terms of tools that can be used to feed their families with.  So here's a concise list of hostilities in the region:  Bandits NPA PRA Military  I'll add some 'psychological information' on the Aetas later...
