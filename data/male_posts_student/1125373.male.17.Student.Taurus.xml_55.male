Let's see here are the highlights of my night: - watching Dane Bond - Monty Python movies...HILARIOUS i might add - playing Monopoly and Kevin and I were neck and neck until the new year came - used MANY poppers and those things you know that you throw at the ground and they pop, well we took about 3 or 4 packs of those gave them all to Colin and he threw them all at the ground at the same time....it was awesome - i nearly got thrown in the pool by Kevin and Kevin... - Kyle, Chris, and Phil came over....they all quoted Monty Python and the holy grail of course....but i love those guys...and Kyle's (McKamie) haircut is dang sexy - hacky sack...enough said   k enough of that   shall all aquaintance be forgot....
