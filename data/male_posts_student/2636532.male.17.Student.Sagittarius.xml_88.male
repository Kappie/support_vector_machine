I guess it would be all that bad if it was always cold, like you'd eventually adjust to the weather and it wouldn't seem so bad after a while. but no! we have to have a freaking summer where it got up to 33 degrees during the day, and then after that we get a freaking winter where at night it got down to -45...that's a 88 degree difference! it's so annoying, the temperture varies so much here it's not even funny, i tell you Alberta's got the most messed up weather anywhere.it can rain one minute and then be clear the next. snow one second and then melt away in an instant. bloody alberta weather. blast it! -Matt
