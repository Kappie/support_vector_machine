So far I've been rejected by Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD and I only have UCSB and Cornell left. Cornell is a total long shot so I need UCSB to accept me. They say that the later the response the better as they have to print up all the papers for you to sign and stuff. I really hope so. My life is so screwed if I don't get into graduate school!   Looks like I need to cut my weight down from 148 to 142 by Friday at 1 PM for the wrestling tournament if I want to wrestle with the team. The likelihood of that happening is slim to none without a hard wrestling work out. I pretty much have to starve myself for the next 48 hours in addition to working out hard to make it. I guess I have no choice eh? I start cutting tomorrow. I guess I won't be downing too many brews with Flo tomorrow night?  I've been listening to some One Man Army lately. They're a freaking fun band to watch. I highly recommend their  Last Word Spoken  (200) album.  ***
