In the way of Radio, I will be testing tomorrow afternoon, Saturday (all day), and Sunday afternoon.  The preliminary radio station will be released this coming Monday (Memorial Day ~ 5/31).  In this preliminary station, Nick and I will just test music - that's it - no voice.  It may be a little boring ;-) but don't worry - We should be up by June 4th.
