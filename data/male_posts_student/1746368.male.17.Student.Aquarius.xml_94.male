Let's see...I didn't really do much today. I talked with Dominique online and she and a friend were purposefully trying to confuse me. It worked, but it wasn't funny! Anyways, there is nothing else to say. Tomorrow is an A day so it is going to be weird going to my A day classes two days in a row. I should have been sick yesterday, that would have been much better for me. I would have much less homework to make up. I think I shall be going now. Talk to everyone later. Oh, everyone go to  urlLink http://www.google.com  type in "Google" and then hit the "I'm feeling lucky" button.
