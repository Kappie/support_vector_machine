Thought that we were supposed to meet at the multimedia lab but didn't see anyone there, later on then know that the whole class is at the design studio. Haiz... tomorrow doing performance, Jonathan came up with the idea of creating music using bamboo stick and Mr Chandra came up with the name "Debamboo" as our group name. So we started planning for the performance.      After that we went for lunch and then we went to the concourse to rehearse for a few hours till when Mr Chandra said he's going for a meeting and told us to continue our rehearsal. It was then that a whole lot of us got out to walk around the school. I went with Xin Hao, Raymond and Jun Qing to see the CCA openhouse. We then went to search for the chess club and finally found it. Then I saw Simon also in the chess club, haha, finally saw someone I knew. After that we went back to the concourse to continue the rehearsal. A lot of the bamboos are split by all those hittings and banging. After hours of rehearsing, finally can go home, yay!      Transport taken today: Bus 74     Feeling: Tired
