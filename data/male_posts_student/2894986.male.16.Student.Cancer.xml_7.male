You can just the excitement in this house as the final buzzer sounded. Also in the second round, Stanford (another number one), two 2 seeds, a three seed, and a four seed fell to upsets. Illinois hammered Cincy by 24 points. The West coast showed why there is an east coast bias in college baskeball. Three big teams from the west fell before the first weekend ended. The third round has shaped up nicely. Marquee match-ups include Duke/Illinois. Each team won both there games by atleast 20 points. The survivor of the OK St./Pitt game should make a run at the championship. UCONN looks like it is playing its best basketball of the season and its a championship contender.  My bracket was done before the weekend even came. Gonzaga was a Final Four team for me. I was successful with my Syracuse pick though. I even picked Illinois and Greg didn't. One thing is for sure though, making 5 brackets was the smart thing to do: I got to put a big black line through Kentucky in each one of them. The most fun I've had drawing a line ever.
