I didn't even do too badly, but the sadness I felt emanating from the other comics in that shoebox of a room was almost unbearable.  Good thing I got drunk later on in the night.  Then I did 5 minutes in front of about 10 people at a place called the village lantern.  Not as depressing, enjoyable almost, except for the fact that not every comic did a joke about how many gay people live in the village.  That would have made the night even more filled with giggles.  Good thing I got drunk later on in the night.  I finished off my day by going to see a late show at the Comedy Cellar.  Jim Norton and Dov Davidoff were funny, but that was about it.  Sitting in that club seeing how the audience almost lost their fucking minds laughing and applauding for jokes ranging from "Did you ever notice that titties..." to "The thing about titties is..." made me want to kill everyone around me and then show up at the presinct to admit that I did it.  Good thing I'm drunk right now.
