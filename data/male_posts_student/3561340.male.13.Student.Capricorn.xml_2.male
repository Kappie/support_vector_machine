So, that should give you an idea of what the voacb/analogies section was like. I answered 45 of the 60 questions, but I think most of the ones answered were correct. I think math went really well and the reading part should have been okay. The writing section wasnt too bad, and I got a relatively easy topic: Discoveries are often made by not following directions. Well after the test which took about 3 1/2 hours I came home and got some food. Then onto the Mohawks Festival. It was awesome becuase they had gear for really cheap, but I didnt have any money to buy anything :-( I missed the first 3 games and everyone missed me. Soon, our game started. I hardly played because all the games wree on the same schedule, and there were 4 games going on at one time. I wish I got to play more becuase I was on a reallly good line. O well. Then riding and food and practiced a bit of lacrosse, and now I feel sick. Butt... I dont have to go to school on Monday! Yayyy. Im goin to work with my Daddy in order to make some $$ And I get some more time to work on my social studies essay, which, as of now, is only 2 1/2 pages and only describes up to the first battle. Anyways Hun should send my acceptance/denial letter in about two weeks so Ill let you all know when I get the news and then, presuming I get in, Ill do my end of the year memories/good-byes/criticizations. But, we will all have to wait to figure out where Im going next year. (Keep your fingers crossed that I get into Hun) Thats it. Peace
