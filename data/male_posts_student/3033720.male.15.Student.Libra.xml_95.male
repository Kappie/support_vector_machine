There's a whole lotta fireworks goin' on outside right now. I was just in Grandview watching 'em. When I was in Florida, I saw a firework stand on the side of the road called, "Betty's Fireworks: The Biggest Bang In Town!" Hmm...pretty ironic, huh? Enough for now....I'm just going to sit hurr and wait for Ponder to find me a decent quote. Uh oh, he's typing; OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 So, Ponder says:  PigsIsBeautifull:   Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree? I travel the world And the seven seas-- Everybody's looking for something. Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you Some of them want to abuse you Some of them want to be abused.  -Lacie
