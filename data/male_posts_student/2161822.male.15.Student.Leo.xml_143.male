I've never played that long before, and I wasn't getting bored either. Aside from sitting around thinking of a song to play, it was awesome. Before that I went on a run with Dave and found out how out of shape I really am. Hopefully that will change soon because if not I'll be screwed for the season. Now I'm bored.   (Hope you feel better. It's boring without you. Pfft.)
