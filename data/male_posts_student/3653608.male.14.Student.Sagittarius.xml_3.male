I hope I don't mess up. WISH ME LUCK! I had a huge long post to write (3 sides of A5) but it wasn't meant to be, because I seem to have lost it. Oh well. I love Sherbert Lemons, do do do! I am very pleased with the responce to my new blog, but I think I might change. I think i might be indecisive, but I'm not quite sure. Did ANYBODY watch big brother? There was a fit guy in a th0ng, but I'm sure that would've been enough to inspire Patrick to watch it, but the ever-cynical patrick probably hates it.  He's so fit. The guy in the th0ng i mean not Patrick. See ya. I love y'all
