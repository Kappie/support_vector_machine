I'm nearing the end of midterm week at school and I've just been really lazy and horribly motivated.  All I've been doing is procrastinating online and talking to friends all afternoon.  Next week, I'm getting back on track though.  It hasn't really been much of a problem though, I'm acing my french, history, and english midterms.  Getting a B most likely on Chemistry, definitely getting a B on the Music Appreciation midterm, and we'll see about math, hopefully I can ace it.  I may not because I ran out of room doing a problem the wrong way so I did it over on a seperate piece of paper and when I handed it in my teacher said she wouldn't accept it.  She hates me so much and she's so unprofessional.  But what are you gonna do?  You're not gonna find private school teachers at a public school.  On a lighter note, another one of the reasons I haven't had time for traditional school work and blogging and such is that I have really kicked my reading into overdrive.  I bought Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and Nine Stories by J.D. Salinger.  I finished Fast Food Nation yesterday, and started Nine Short Stories..yesterday, haha.  Fast Food Nation was fantastic.  I have never seen such a superb slab of journalism work.  Reading that book was enlightening and even empowering in so many ways.  I have been a vegetarian for almost a year and a half now, initially starting out to see what it was like, not really concerned with the values commonly associated with vegetarianism, however, recently I have really become very opinionated on concerning my lifestyle.    Here is my message to all of my readers: Stop eating all fast food.  The effects of this industry have raped our land, our cities, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and affects all of our lives every day in unimaginable ways.  Please, if you care about yourself, or this world population, read this book and boycott fast food.  Perhaps in an entry down the road I'll really get on a rant about the real facts on fast food, but not today.
