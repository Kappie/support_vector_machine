The number one problem is that nobody tells you anything. Everyone has this huge problem because they think it will “hurt your feelings” and it really is a problem. Everybody else knows everything before you, other people are let in on secrets and you can never really know somebody.   People hide things from you when you’re a ‘nice guy’, and I guess I can’t blame them. When you tell nice people about your problems, you can only expect one reply. Something along the lines of “oh, no” or “that’s too bad”. People go to honest people when they have problems, because they’ll get honest feedback. That’s what people need.   The big thing about honest feedback is that nobody likes it, yet everybody wants it. It’s a very tough thing to take. To use an example; if you like a girl and she doesn’t like you back, would you rather she said “no” straight off, or ‘pity date’ you until she can take it no more? The answer I’d take is the honest no, I don’t know about any of you.     There is a big difference between honest and nice. The word nice, to me, is such a plastic word. It’s very sweet on the tongue, and it’s not a negative comment, but I would much rather be called honest. It’s much more of a compliment.   Nice is when people will lie to you at all times as long as you feel good. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a bad thing in small doses, but when something like the above situation occurs, the lie becomes more painful then the truth (strangely enough!).   Honest people know when the time has come to be honest. These people are very hard to find. I myself have found a few, but they wouldn’t want their names on the internet. These people put others before themselves, not to be noticed or to be remembered as “the guy who was good enough to do that” but just because it is what they do.     These people are always there, and always tell you what you need to hear. Whether it is a white lie to motivate you to try harder, or the harsh truth to stop you from doing the wrong thing. These people have risen above these standard human, and should be commended, because that is a tough thing to do in a society like ours, where the different are outcast (in most cases).  But these people live up to their names, they are honest. They don’t like the limelight, and would rather do their job quietly then draw attention. These unsung heroes shy away from the glare of publicity, because they know that good deeds feel good because they are good, not because of the reward.  They aren’t all people working for the Salvos, or St Vincent de Paul (though that in itself is commendable) but most of these people do it unconsciously, not knowing that they are good people.     I call these people Angels.     I really do believe in the angel theory. There are some people on this earth that I think are (unknown to them) spiritually superior. Sent by God? It depends, but wherever they come from it doesn’t matter. These angels are the guardians of the Earth, the universes way of holding us together, the glue of the human psyche.     Look at us, the human race. We are a beautiful representation of the balance of good and evil. We all have the potential to go either way. Inside us we have anger and hate, balanced with calm and love. Most of us grow going neither way, because of the choices we make we end up in the middle, living in “sin” but also doing good things for ourselves and others.   With balance comes the obvious need for unbalance, and this can occur with the “end of the scales” evil people. We hear of them all the time; Hitler, Saddam, Stalin, Himmler, Osama, the Klu Klux Klan, wife beaters, child rapists, murderers, the list is endless! Evil itself is the opposite of good, and therefore, these evil people crave the media and the limelight as much as our ‘angels’ repel it. A big factor of evil is fear, and nothing spreads fear like evil.  Now, with the scale of life weighted down by evil, good needs to be created to balance the scale again. Angels are created, people so pure of heart and honest of mind that it is incomprehensible to us. While these good people do not look for the media, it sometimes finds them, because everyone loves a “nice” story. People like Jesus, Mother Teresa, Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther king; all these people humble us, the seem almost inhuman with what they have done.    There are millions of angels that we never remember, the dedicated fireman, the person who gives up his seat on the bus for the old man, the loving father/mother, the missionary, the friend that would rather get you angry at him then let you come to harm.    Which of course brings us back to the starting the point. Because in the end, angels would sacrifice themselves for others (even in something as small as a conversation at school) then let others come to harm.   Everyone knows angels in their lifetime, and we all have the potential to become one. Think about it, could you be an angel to somebody? Are you? Are you an evil person to some people?   Angels are the walls that were made to be leant on, but without them the house comes crashing down. Evil is the crack in the roof that lets the rain in, but without it, nothing would ever be fixed or changed.    The universe is perfectly balanced, and always will be.
