I believe her, but I think she's having doubts. First day back at college today. It was pretty fun but nothing special. No one from college was on my bus this morning so I got the impression it was Sunday or something. Then when I got to my classroom there was nobody in there and it had gone 9.05. But then... everyone turned up, so that was alright. The 2 old buildings are officially closed now, and the 2 canteens in the new college are open, so that means we don't have to walk for 5 minutes every day just to get some food. There was this cool, huge, bouncy thing (I dunno what the hell it was exactly) outside my class today and it was slightly fun jumping on it many-a-time! I also spent 20 minutes riding around the college in a wheelchair type thing and it was super fast and I was doing drivebys! Adam wasn't in today.  He claims to be on holiday, but I saw him in HMV not so long ago... so we have decided not to tell him we are going to Liverpool on Thursday! The lil' rascal.
