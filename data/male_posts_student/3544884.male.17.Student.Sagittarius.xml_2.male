Apparently I still cry for Candice, well actually Adolfo made me cry it wasn't that I suddenly started thinking about her they made me think about her, but it feels like shit to think about someone you love and hear people talking shit about that person. And then to make things worst other people keep talking shit when I get sober. I don't want to keep thinking about her, but it's just how I feel, and I hate that other people try to make me think different about her when I totally think the opposite. It's just fucked up the way some people are, trying to manipulate other people's feeling just to feel better about themselves or to see other people feel bad, to much hypocrisy mostly on girls...   Well not only bad moments I had in Medina Lake last night, I also found out some funny things that weren't very funny to me but they made me laugh seeing it from another perspective.  1. I was swimming all the way to the middle of the lake, well I was in a floater and this girl is all scared and she goes there all the way to get me and "save" me but like I saw her all tired and I gave her the floater and I went back all the way swimming by myself, haha.  2. I fucked up my sister's cell phone, I got in the lake with it. Hopefully it turns on again.  3. When we were leaving they were all looking for my shirt, and I told them it was gray, and actually it was just a white underwear t shirt. So I end up leaving without a shirt.  4. We got lost in our way back to the city, I don't remember shit.  5. They took me home, but I told them I didn't want to get home yet, I guess I kind of knew how I was.  6.I woke up in Adolfo's truck, later I found out I told them I didn't want to get off the truck, after finding out I was all alone in the truck I went insides Adolfo's house, there were like three different persons in the floor plus like other four in the bed, the ones I knew was Adolfo, Rodolfo, Janet and Lucha, the rest I didn't even knew.  I don't really remember everything that happened at the lake, I kind of have vague memories haha but it was ok I guess.
