It's gonna end up in my hands! The wonderous, fabulous book! Imagine my excitement, my frantic anticipation! Finally! The book!   I am gonna get the adult version. The metal pheonix is so cool, and the entire design attracted me. I wanted the children's cover at first, but a close look at it put me off. No offense, but it is kinda ugly. The metal phoenix is cooler, and seems so powerful. The children's phoenix pales in comparison.  Ahh!! Can't wait to read the book!  Countdown:  1  Day To Order of Phoenix
