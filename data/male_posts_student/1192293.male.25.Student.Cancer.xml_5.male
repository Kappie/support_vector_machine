In the course of this conference he said "Some Democrats view the lesson of the last election is to go out and to run as far to the left as possible. The reemergence of the liberal wing of the Democrat Party is in full swing"(source: White House Web Page- Follow above link).  If this were true, I'd write him a letter asking who these people were, 'cause I haven't heard a damn thing from them lately.
