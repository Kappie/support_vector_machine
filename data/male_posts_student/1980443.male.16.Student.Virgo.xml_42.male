You'll hear alot of these testimonies I'm sure, but it's just really good to experience this kind of trip.  I won't go into detail about all the fun things we did, I will tell you we swam with sharks, I'll try to put a picture in, went to Atlantis (that's a really expensive hotel, that bro kwame had connections with), and we had a great time running their VBS where there was a fight every night, lol.  Anyway, spiritually: 1.  I need to constantly be in the word of God.  Those people knewtheir bible like the back of their hand, and they applied it.  So many times I read my devotions and forget them the next day, I need to be using my Bible as the tool that God has given me to fight against sin, and give glory to God. 2.  I need to be more vocal with my faith, especially with all my friends, I'm a senior now and a lot of leadership comes with that, I think we senior guys and girls need to be "sharpening" one another just like proverbs says. 3.  Witnessing, How often I don't even think about it, if I really am excited about being a Christian, I should tell people the Great News.  Hey this guy who lived, died, for me!  Wouldn't that be enough motivation to tell someone? That's so important.   I hope you enjoy these pictures, if they load...  Summer's almost gone.... Keep it real, I'm Will
