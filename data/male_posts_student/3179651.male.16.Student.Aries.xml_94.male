I sued a towel because birdies have nasty thingies in their feathers. Then the bird wouldn't fly away, it kept tweeting at me. Then it started hovering above my hand before landing on it again. Finally it flew straight at my face and all was good.  I would have some pictures but my mom wouldn't take them and she definitely wouldn't hold the bird...
