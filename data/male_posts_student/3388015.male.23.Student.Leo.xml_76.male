I had cereal and milk for breakfast - ahhh...another luxury I miss dearly. Milk leads to risky behavior. I took a nap after breakfast.  While I was enjoying being somewhere else for a while, Luke adopted a kitten (despite my assertions that cats are the devil's spawn) from Lollypop Farm. He brought the devil's spawn to my room late Sunday night and I enjoyed her company greatly. I insist her name should be CindyVacaCat, as she is just like me! She desperately needs Luke to feed her and take her places and she goes poop in a box in the corner. He wants to name her Ashley (VOMIT!) and Laura wants to name her Skip-Bo.  Skip Bo!   Benny called again, to console me on the bad news, I gather. Our conversations are funny. I tell him how devastatingly poor I am, and he tells me where his next leisurely vacation will be. Naivete and worldliness in one package - you can't ask me why I fell.  Life is full of humor. Luke and I did our laundry at his apartment complex where it costs $1.25 opposed to $2.00 here. And then we dry our clothes here free, opposed to $1.00 there. We save seventy-five cents per wash, and one dollar per dry. Then we went to Walmart and spent over $110 on who-knows-what. Well, I didn't spend anything. I just enjoyed watching Luke agonize over which trash receptacle to buy.    Luke:  Should I get the little white one, or the little white one?  When Luke gets very very tired, he regresses to his early childhood and his speech becomes almost unintelligible. So the above rumination went more like this:   Luke:  meh. mumah. nanana. plooofrf.  Needless to say, he got the little white one.  My soulmate of 13 years has now achieved her dreams. She now has a job where she wears a suit. In high school, someone asked Kim what she wanted to do with her life, what career interested her, what did she want to be. She said "I want to be a business woman so I can wear nice suits." My memory is impeccable and this is exactly what she said. Model/Actress/Astronaut and now, lawyer, my overachieving best friend just graduated law school with two degrees: masters in...uh...something smart, I'm sure. We met when we were 12 at Virgil Junior High School and our moment of bonding came in the form of our fanaticism for a horrible horrible band called "The Party," an offshoot of the New Mickey Mouse Club. Kim and I were total snots in junior high school and we continued to be snots throughout high school. But now, only she has the right to be one. I have become an underachieving loser and I respect that Kim still finds me interesting enough to call me her friend. My mind followed a dark path when I was sixteen. I hid from the world, and my best friend, for an entire year. And, as is my fashion, I emerged to find my true friend waiting for me. It was that year she introduced me to Sarah McLachlan. And you know the rest of   that   story.  Kim and her (my) parents save me from homelessness, and still have faith in me when my own genetic relations have failed to care. Kim and I are twins at the core, but I'm the  BAD  twin.   urlLink    My Overachieving Best Friend, Kim. urlLink
