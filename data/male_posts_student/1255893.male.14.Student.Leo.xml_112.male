I just read Kaitlyn's blog ......... what's all this shit about Ave hurting US. she hasn't hurt ME ...... even though the dumping was a lil bad.... but thats not the point. Don't pin your shit on more people than yourself, if YOU feel bad ... then say that! She hasn't done anything to piss ME off, or you for that  matter, and don't think I'm not involved cus thanks to you I am. Anyway I already explained to you why she don't call you back. Need me to refresh your mind? How's this: you make her feel guilty for being happy every once in a while. Things aren't as great up there as you would think. She calls the people that make her happy. It just so happens that I'm one of those people (thankfully). Anyway you seem pretty happy most of the time that I see you. So why not act the way you feel? At least that way you won't confuse people. That might go for you too Ave. This is the last time I will look at Kaitlyn's blog cus I took her off my links. Now to all of you who are involved : I'm sick of all this bullshit melodrama! Shut the fuck up i you have nuthing good to say. If you can't fucking shut your mouth then try to see the other person's point of view. Stop being so damn universalistic (core term!) Your side may not be the best to see things from. Anyway, if you wanna comment thats kewl, just don't go putting it in your blogs(KAITLYN) that is .... if you want me to actually read it. Cus when you said (y not say it to my face?) just think about it and fllow your own advice. L8R people.
