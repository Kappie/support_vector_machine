Clark or Indigo?....Okay....no idea what I'm talking bout?....Mo Better Blues....Denzel's love interests....okay now you are up to snuff....which one?....I mean for me it woulda been no question.....Clark all the way....but really...who should Denzel have chosen?  Anyways I had an ummm....interesting chat with the oh so fine Kelly and the delectable Kiz last night along with Omar and Serenity and a few others.....I was under the influence of some fire water but I still think a fun time was had by all....as soon as i get unlazy I shall add a link to Kiz and Serenity....they be good people...in the meanwhile you get to em via Kel.....  I want to say hey to Meka even though I know she won't read this....  Oh well back to Mo Betta Blues....  Peace
