But whatever.. at least we got to hang out for a while. Yeah... anyway before all that crap happened things werent going so well. Well apparently mine and Steph's friendships are over... I tried to fix things but she just didnt want it to be.. so whatever... life goes on. Ashley and me are now semi friends i guess... We were kinda semi friends before but now so more i guess?? i dunno really lol.  Anyway... me n Christian went out with Audra tonight... we pretty much drove around town looking for somewhere to go, but didnt actually stop anywhere cuz we all had to be back at a certain time which kinda sucked but oh well... anytime with Audra is good time :D.  Yeah anyway, ima go sleep now cuz i got a headache lol.
