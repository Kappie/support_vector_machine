I will be so happy when this semester and quarter is OVER! Ugh! I found out today that I got an A on my French test. I'm so happy! Shocking that I got an A, since I didn't do like the last 30. But moving on.  Yesterday I had Aviation, Physics Part I, and French. They all went great. Since Physics is my Early Bird, I had two days to do it. I finished today.  Today I had US History, American Literature, and Physics Part II. They all went great. I will be so happy tomorrow though when they are all done.  I can't stop thinking about Will. I don't know why. I know he is with Mike, but still. He is so cute. I haven't felt this way about anyone since Quinn died. Does it mean something? I hope so.  I may write more tonight.
