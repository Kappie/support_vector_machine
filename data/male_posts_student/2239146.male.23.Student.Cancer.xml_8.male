Now, I bargain with you again. If ten people who attend Cal-State Fullerton are hungry for you, just ten, will you send revival? I beg this of you God, as I present my ten: Jessica, Eleanor, Felix, AJ, Aaron, Andrew, Clay, Sean, Derek, and myself. Those are the ten hungry ones. Lord God, bring your revival to my school!
