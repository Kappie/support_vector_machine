Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 18:2-4  He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.  He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.  Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--  children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. - John 1:10-13
