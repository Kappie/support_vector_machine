I cant wait till this shit is over.  My b-day in 2 days, im getting a small tv in my room that attacches to the wall and swivels so i can play my games up there.  I also might get a PA system from my dad, either that or an acoustic amp will work.  sdlkaksgl;asgjl;sdal;kgj FUCKIN FINALS RRRRRRRRRRRR ON MY BIRTHDAY
