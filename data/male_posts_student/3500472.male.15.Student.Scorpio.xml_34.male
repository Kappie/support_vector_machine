Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still     Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall     Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all     I can only imagine  I can only imagine     When that day comes     And I find myself     Standing in the Son     I can only imagine     When all I will do     Is foreverForever worship You     I can only imagine          know what? Mr. Cavanaugh has an awesome thing going for him...please dont take that the wrong way, but he was born with sight, lost it, and the very first thing he sees when he gets his sight back in Jesus welcoming him into heaven...
