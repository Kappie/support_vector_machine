It's great if you are hearing it for the first time, but if you're follwing the person and he/she tells every other person the same thing. This is the reason I try not to repeat myself. There's a downside to it, though. I tend to run out of news very vquickly, and then I have to repeat the other things. Another slight problem is, I can't exactly remember what I told each person. I think I should just repeat everything that happens to me every time. It just makes life easier, don't you think?  Well, I'm learning to play the guitar, and my fingers hurt. I have had to press down like really hard on the strings because my fingers aren't strong enough yet. So, my fingertips are hurting. The only cords I have learnt are the Em and C cords. I'm not sure if I can remember all but I'll try. At least I can learn to play one musical instrument.
