Want to know what the hell Spyware is and why you don't want it on your machine?  Well, then I've got some answers for you!  First off, Spyware is very annoying! How do you get it? You get it all the time from surfing the net! Some web pages you go to install spyware on your computer without you even knowing. So why is this so bad? Well, it tracks what you're doing and sends it back to whoever is tracking you, but the main problem with Spyware is that it really slows down your computer! Luckily, I have a tool that will allow you to scan your omputer for Spyware, then remove it! Hopefully speeding up your system or just relieving you that it's no longer there. This tool is important, even if you have an Anti-Virus program such as Norton, AVG, or McAfee installed on your system because Spyware is not a virus and will most likely not be picked up by your Anti-Virus software.  The program I use and recommend for this is called Spybot Search  Destroy!  Anyhow, download  Spybot   urlLink here   I also use Ad-Aware, which is similar to Spybot and I recommend having both these programs on your machine. It's always good to have extra protection after all, and when both programs are free, why not!  Download  Ad-Aware   urlLink here   Totally free downloads by the way :D      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
