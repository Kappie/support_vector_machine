I think I screwed up in telling him that I needed more because I can't breathe out of one nostril and holding liquids in my mouth is still a problem after a four hours. I can't even see what he did which I guess is a good thing. The dentist is good though because his TV gets the channels we don't so I could watch Lance Armstrong beat the crap out of Jan Ullrich whilst having my teeth drilled. Overall this dentist visit gets a 6 on a scale from 1 to acceptable.
