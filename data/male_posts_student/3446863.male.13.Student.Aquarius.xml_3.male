I've heard that you've gotta work 18 hours a day at Microsoft but I personally don't mind that at all cuz I'm assured that what I'm developing is going to change or enhance the lives of millions of other developers and users out there. Yeah I know, it might seem a lil scary when considering the magnitude but I know that if I put that little more time for my programs, I will create bug free apps...  At Microsoft, the phrase, "Your Potential, Our Passion" seems to be taken seriously but I think that if Microsoft could assign a group of die hard programmers who have seen what bugs are all about (buffer overflows and what not) and could convert that experience into a "Code Evaluator for all Runtime possibilities" App which could be used to potentially destroy the thought of Runtime Errors (Overflows etc.)    I know that I'm just talking... Anyone who understands the problem can talk but not anyone can implement... Making this app is an aim ... But I guess I'm still on the way to fulfilling it...  I still respect all the decisions made by Microsoft =)  Okay then,  I'm off to get some sleep now...   Bye...!
