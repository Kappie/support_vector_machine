Oh well its not too bad, today I just cleaned a bit well alot acually, I feel like being nice the last few days, which is a good thing.  I talked to Richard last night for the first time in I think is almost a week. It was only for about 15seconds or so becuase I was on the other line. I'm not sure where he is or anything but he wanted my postle code?! haha he said something about his cell phone or something he was getting a new one or a new plan. lol oh well he'll prolly send me the bill it would be just like him! haha I know he was getting a cabin for himself for a week becuase he wanted a break from his grandma's husband. He says he gets very annouying but then again everyone seems annouying to richard!  Ok well I guess I'll just go enjoy the rest of the day, its going by fairly Quickly!
