Whats more i am going to Thailand,Bangkok on fri evening with a couple of friends, need to pick some stuff but i shall be back by monday morning since we'll be having a class BBQ on that day, hope i;d be fun.  I am so looking forward towards the end of the week, only now i have got to get across the mind field of test! I have got chemistry coming up tomorrow (tues) and i seriously stink at it, have not quite got the grasp of the tested chapters nor have i been paying attention so i have about 2 or so hours to master it! haha...i am always doing this to myself! 1.)Hopefully the paper is darn easy. 2.)We seat wherever we want and do not need to separate our tables. 3.)open book test 4.)She feels like sharing with me her results and the most likely 5.)i become genius...hey wait i already am,oops...no, i am not...sorry.  And then i still have got to clear the social studies test, why social studies? and not darth of all students or perhaps mega difficult test on information you need not know... The sod of a subject is bloody difficult to fail decently yet pass decently...I mean do we seriously need to know such bullshit? We'll i guess if they feel adding this highly challenging and idiotic subject to our curriculum is going to instill national pride and all...go ahead but only i find it ironic that after all this national pride thingy, it's causing us to fail...what is that suppose to signal to us?  I'll be a quitter...they seam to be better off, then "stayers"...  You know u love me
