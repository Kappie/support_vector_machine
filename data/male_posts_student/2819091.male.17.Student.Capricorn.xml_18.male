I know that you are no longer here, Yet I imagine you in my arms. We were never really close, I know, That never stopped me, though... From being in love with you so.  What am I going to do? Where else could I go, My world was based around you. Fate dealt me a heavy blow, Now I am in an emotional low.  You were my sunshine when my world was in rain, You were my comfort when I felt pain, You were my pride when I was in shame, You extinguished my maddening flame, When I desired to have someone to maim. Now that you are gone, I no longer feel the same.  I hope to ease my pain, Even if there is tomorrow... Without you.
