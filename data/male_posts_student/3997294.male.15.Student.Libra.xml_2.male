He had great things toshare with other people, because he really was a smart guy, but he had no one to tell. One day he decided he was going to get alot of friends. He went up to a bunch of different people and hit it off really well. He soon become very popular and had tons of friends. One day he realized that he was a lot less happy since he become popular. He wondered about this and thought to himself. I have a great family. I know Jesus and he loves me. I have lots of friends why am I sad? He thought about this for a long time. Then he realized the reason he was sadwas because of his many friends. He constantly was trying to help them anywaypossible and live upto his standards of what a friend should be. So one day he decided he was going to stop having friends.
