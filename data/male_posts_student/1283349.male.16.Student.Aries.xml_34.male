More RPing than you can shake a stick at. I bought some credits, went wild with craziness once I realized how cool all the Arboreal (druids, basically) skills are, then went even wilder with supercraziness once Asaka, Goddess of the Wild chose Rasca (my character) to be in her Divine Order. Man, role playing up the wazoo pays off in scads, and is fun too.  I have a feeling that the Godfavors are gonna be coming in short order. Hella badass.  Dynasty Warriors 4 STILL rocks, and I'm still playing it. I foresee I'll be playing it for years to come, what with the immense replay value.  I swear, in the near future, I'll go off on a rant about something like before and write a squillion pages about some nonsense. Give me your votes in the comment section, and I'll start the Hot Air Crap Mumbo Jumbo Bellows.  -Dice Squirrel Mad Psionist (WORDPLAY!)
