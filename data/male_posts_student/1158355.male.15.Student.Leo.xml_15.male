It was funny. Today nothing good happened except for when Joe M in science while Paul Joe and I were taking the test, Joe goes EUUUUUUUH... _fart_! Definetly the most funniest thing that ever happened in school... well Mr. Rippert's UHHG KABOOM! was pretty good but this was great. I was laughing so hard I was crying like crazy. We were taking the test in the central science lab. Oh ya in English our sub was Mr. Baumgarden and we spent the period throwing books everywhere. Great Day Of School.
