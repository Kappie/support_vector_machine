I have come to the conclusion that I will have to be satisfied with the rather bland look of this site for another 3 or 4 months because my time is really at a premium.  I have found time to read my ever increasing list of favorite blogs and check my e-mail daily, but that's about it.  That appears to be the way life will be for awhile in Student Doctor Killa Cal's life (alot going on in that sentance).  Just found....an archive of smoove writings by  urlLink  Smoove B .  If I could verbalize my macking like him I wouldn't be in the situation I am in now!  Laterz!
