However, I heard some interesting theories last night on one of the talk shows.  The longer Sadr is alive, the more radicals flock to his cause, streaming into Najaf and mixing it up with US Marines (usually that's not the healthiest thing to be doing).  Perhaps we've let Sadr hang around to serve as the lightning rod, drawing the bad guys out into open conflict.  They've invested heavily in Sadr's viability as an alternative to the Provisional Government, and they're going to fight to keep him going.  Crazy like a fox?
