Needless to say, my weekend both rocked and sucked at the same time.  Got to hang out with my friends and the woman I love, but my body suffered and the test this morning left much to be desired.  Oh well.  Anyways, I got a video of Frank doing the "butterfly" or as it is known in other circles, the booty clap.  Email me if you want me to send it to ya!  Peace
