Lately I've been having weird dreams... last night I dreamed that I kept trying to get to a bunker type place to hide out for the winter. The problem it was snowing and this tiny mountain path / cliff... was blocked with heavy snow... so Wataru and I couldn't get past it in his car. So I got out and walked... somehow I ended up in California and Nai picked me up in a classic Mustang... she would eventually drop me off at the bunker. It was guarded by people in Fallout combat armor, but they just trained me to use large and small guns and let me in. Then I was in and Cissa was watching TV in there. However, part of the bunker was the Heritage Park Library? So when I was there... a big black dude gave me a note that Prof. Topik wanted to talk to me. I would eventually talk to him about coffee and then I woke up.  Now playing...  Pulley 's "Gone"  **
