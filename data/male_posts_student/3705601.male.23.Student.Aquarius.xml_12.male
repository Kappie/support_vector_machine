Despite this, the events of July 7 is still and will always be fresh on my mind. I just flew in from Manchester that morning and was ecstatic because all of the events of this summer culminated with what I believed to be the number one event of the summer. Rush's 30th anniversary tour concert stop in Los Angeles, California. I was accompanied to the concert by my friend, Aris. We walked 6-8 miles from our hotel to the venue (a great work-out, and a great way to build up excitement). We finally, arrived with about 5 minutes to go before the 7:30PM start time. I made a stop at the merchandise booth to buy t-shirts. I was much jarred when the music started playing and I was nowhere near the viewing area. i didn't miss very much though because it was just a medley full of Rush's more well-known songs from the past 30 years. I couldn't keep my eyes off the stage area while I was finding my seat (something that makes searching for my seat more dificult). I finally found my seat and I found that I was farther away from the stage that I had thought I would be. It wasn't so bad though, because my friend, Aris was in a section farther than mine was. I did get to see a lot of the show and the sound was clear (which is a testament to how well built the Bowl was). Shortly after the show started, I went to look for my friend Aris to find a better seat and sit beside my friend.  The show itself was a spectacle with an amazing lightshow. The music was, as anticipated, very good. Rush was still a very tight group, something that 30 years of performing together would do. They did not make a single mistake during their show and still have more energy than your average 50+ year old rock stars.   After the medley, they started out with "Spirit of Radio", and "Animate". They would also go on and play songs like "Bravado", "Dreamline", "Red Barchetta" (much to my surprise because I thought they "retired" that song from their live set), and of course staples of a Rush live show, "Tom Sawyer" and "2112". Along the way, Rush also played an acoustic set of 2 songs, "Resist" and "Heart Full of Soul". This was preceded by the Neil Peart drum solo in which my friend described Neil Peart as "half man half octopus".  Rush also played some songs from their new EP "Feedback", which features covers of songs from bands that influenced each member when they were teenagers. The songs that were played in the show were "The Seeker", the affore-mentioned "Heart Full of Soul", and of course the first release "Summertime Blues" (which was part of the encore).   I was also somewhat disappointed not to hear personal favorites like "Closer to the Heart", and "The Big Money". Despite this, the show was great and after it ended, I wished I could see them again. Unfortuantely, I could not, but at least I was happy to have seen them one time. Rush is truly my favorite band of all-time, and this peformance was truly a one-of-a-kind experience that altered my life forever. This is because Rush really does kick ass! I am absolutely sure that there is a DVD and CD coming out for this event, if so, I will be in line for those items. It really is worth it!!!
