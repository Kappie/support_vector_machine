Got to work and did some work... our manager is gone for vacation so we got some lady as a sub... iunno, I just don't like her too much. Thankfully work went by pretty fast that day. Afterwards, even tho I was tired from all the work I've been doing lately, I went outside to run some ball. Wooo.... my shot is WET. Like honestly... I've never been so confident in my shot in my life. I played my friend 1on1, and the whole time he just didn't understand. Well, I'm a big guy so I'm known mostly for my post play, so when I was draining my shots he couldn't figure it out. There were 4 of us there so we ran some 2on2 after. They were pretty fair teams, tho my teammate had a very hard time stopping his man. My shot continued then too. We won the first game and lost the next like 3. But the real fun part was standing in the fountain... hehe... good times.  Sunday: Ran some sc in the morn then took my shower and went out wit the family. We dropped off some movie at Blockbuster then we went to the National Sports across the street from there in Pickering at my request. When I told them I wanted to go I thought they still had mad shoes like before... now all they got is some bootleg "SLAM" basketball shoe. I did find a good deal on some Nike hoodies... $29.99. Not bad considering in the winter they go for about $80. I also bought a ball shirt. It's made out of that shiny material that causes liquids to like slide off, Durasheen or something. That was also on sale for $19.99. So I did the math and calculated $57.49 after taxes so I bust out $60 in my hand while the cashier was ringing it through. Then she asked for $46... and was like "huh?", don't worry, I wasn't complaining. I also noticed she had a PUSH braclet on her left wrist... did she hook me up cuz of that?? ... hahaha... prolly just an honest mistake that I took advantage of. Afterwards it was time for some DQ. Mmmmm... I got the large brownie batter blizzard. It was so chocolatey, like I'm sure they just took some vanilla ice cream and added alota brownie batter in it and mixed it up. Then again that's what their ad said... When we left my parents decided to take us to a movie ^_^. It was kinda a struggle when we were brainstorming movies to see on the way cuz b/w me and my bro we had seen 4 relatively new releases, but when we checked the movie listings at Morningside we decided to see the Bourne Supremacy. We were 2 hrs early so my parents and little bro went to the nearby Wal-Mart while my older bro and I stayed in the arcade. At first we ran some Time Crisis 2 (ya the old one t.t) but it was pretty good. Then we started taking turns playing this basketball shooting thing. Argh!! It got me so mad cuz the ceiling is so low. Like I'm kinda tall and when I shoot I put alota arc in my shot, so alota the time when I shot it hit the ceiling. I had the record first wit 23 then 29. But my bro broke it wit 33. You get bonus time after u hit 30 so the key was getting there first. He ran outta money but I kept on going to beat him. But I swear that game cheats... like I even pointed out to my bro when it wouldn't count my baskets. Eventually I crushed his rec wit a 38 and retired as champ... that was after $20 in tokens... LOL! Finally we went to wait outside the theatre. There was a movie still playing there, something about "Thunderbirds", so we waited outside. As people started waiting with us, one of the Deli ppl from my store arrived and said hi, then a few mins later a guy I know from grocery came by for the same movie too. The movie was pretty good - 3.5/5. Alota killing and intense chases... always good. Iunno, I think I kinda expected a little more... Well after that we went to the Swiss Chalet across the street. It was so empty inside I thought they were closed! When we finally got served I figured why cuz the service sucked. It was a decent meal and I paid for most of it. But we're not going back there again.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well know I guess I gotta address certain ppl...  Will, I commented ur blog so check that. We still are friends...  Matt, I do care that your back, despite still not saying anything to you. I'm sure that Will or Ada filled you in why not. You and Ada both had a countdown here (check earlier posts) but I ended both of them when I found out. You were the one who I felt I could talk to the easiest about what was happening, but you didn't tell me either... I guess at Ada's request. Even tho she is ur best friend, I still don't hold you any less accountable than the other two. I may not be your best friend, but if you were willing to call me a friend at all then I believe that I deserved to know. Don't worry, I'm not gonna be a jerk and start telling ppl the things you've told me, tho the thought has crossed my mind a few times. But as far as I'm concerned, everything that happened since I told Ada how I felt to now was all an act you put on... Trust is a dangerous thing.  But you still have the title of "friend" in my books if that's what ur wondering.  Yet it seems you got the worse of it.  I forgave Ada alot easier than I thought I would (stupid weak heart) and Will and I spoke once in person before he told me and that was when we say I, Robot.  But you I trusted the most...  Now I wonder, did Ada ask you guys to come cuz she was afraid I was gonna pull something?  At first I thought it was just cuz u both wanted to see her that last nite before she left, but now I think there were other reasons too... I ask this her rather than in private because I'm sure I woulda eventually asked all 3 of you, so I guess u guys can collaborate this one too now...  Hmm... now I'm thinking about alota things.  This post was supposed to end after my address to Matt but here I am still...  Ada... I still think about you every spare moment I have, but now its different things.  I have no idea what's going on between u and Will lately, and I can't even imagine what's been troubling you lately.  Alota the time I keep things inside cuz I don't wanna put any extra pressure on you... tho I guess from me posting here I'm doing it anyways (it is MY diary after all :P).  Sometimes I wonder... why did I forgive you so easily?  Why do I still try when you already told me that you weren't going to pursue romance anymore?  What do I expect to happen in the future?  Is there REALLY any space for me in ur busy, busy life?  What can I do that Matt and Will can't?  Am I making thing worse by wedging myself into your life?  What do you really feel for me?  ...then finally... if I was given a chance wit someone else, would I move on?...  I know that you've got more important things on your mind, so don't ponder these questions... in fact, knowing that your prolly gonna read this makes me wanna delete it, but I won't... don't bother with any of this till ur life is a little more stable.  As usual... I'm willing to wait as long as you need  It's funny how starting to write can set you off on other topics...
