The website  urlLink www.albanian-boyz.tk  is running quite allright and i had many many visitors from all around the world. (Today somebody from Serbia  Montenegro visited though)   Im not planning anything special this weekend if i cant talk with Tijana tomorrow at least :P    I dont know why that girl made soooooo "romantic" lol and sweet (im surprised) but i only know that i like so oooo much to be with her  I dont know the reason.      All day in work Ive been listening to  urlLink this song  try to hear it :)    So for now night cuz Im sooo tired       Arbri
