For enthusiasts like myself however, winter represents the chance to experience something rare and special, the Australian snow fields. Wind blown pockets of powder, half-pipe and terrain parks, the feeling of cutting edges and carving turns on unspoiled runs, coupled with the unquestionable atmosphere the Snowy Mountain region possesses this time of year are what I have grown to live for.  For me it's hard to imagine any winter without packing for the weekend, dashing out of the office hours earlier than I should on a Friday arvo, diving into a friend's waiting car whilst shouting... "move move before I get caught", and meandering down the Sydney M5 motorway in anticipation of hitting the slopes. It has become an annual festivity for yours truly, and this year will again be no exception.  I can't wait to hear news of the first big dump mother nature throws on the NSW Snowy Mountains!!! Cause when it does I'll be ready to go!!!
