Some kid was going to take a shot of 12 molar hydrochloric acid. For those of you fortunate not to know what that is, let's just say he'd be dead very quickly. Today at lunch was another unsuccessful attempt at purging our table of Dave. If I hear one more thing about his cell phone or his stupid girl problems I swear I will flip out. I think he should 1. stop making excessively dumb comments. 2. destroy his cell phone. 3. get a girlfriend that lasts more than 24 hours so he will finally shut up about his problems. and 4. be normal for a change. Yes I know it sounds a little extreme but I think.... ah who am I kidding. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.
