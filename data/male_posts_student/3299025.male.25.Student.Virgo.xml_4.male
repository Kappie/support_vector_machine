I figured it might be a good time to tell you all about my psychiatry rotation.  So, I'm working at Chicago Lakeshore Hospital, Child and Adolescent floor, with my classmates Kate and Vivian. It's great to be working with people whom you like and are glad to continue to get to know throughout the rotation. Vivian is this lovely Korean American woman who is dating the skinniest white man on the planet (I love Armand!!). She's one of those types who sorta giggles her way around being a supergenius, so that the rest of the world doesn't get mad that her IQ is about twenty points higher than the rest of ours. Kate is this tall, beautiful woman with freckles who doesn't like to hear that she's as gorgeous as she is. And the woman has "professional" written all over her; like, it would be impossible for her to be a waitress or something, because you'd be like, this woman looks like someone's CEO. We are all sorta bumbling along being sorta ridiculous, a little unsure of how to talk to psychiatrically unstable patients and, at times, psychiatrically unstable staffpersons.  The day goes like this: We show up. We try to find our assigned fellows (resident physicians who do most of the legwork of caring for the patients in the hospital) to see if there are any new patients we should follow and work up. We go and talk to the patients, see why they're here in the hospital. Then, after a number of these encounters, we meet with our attending physician (the person ultimately responsible for the care of these patients) and tell him what we discovered. He signs something, asks questions, and we move on to the next patient. Then after that, we're pretty much done for the day. So we can talk with patients more, sit in on group sessions, do any additional follow up work we were asked to do. Or we go home. I like that one.  One of the great things about working at this particular facility is working with the great physicians that we get to know. My attending is Dr. Alan Ravitz, a man whom we're guessing to be in his early 50's with most of his hair (hooray!) and a bushy mustache. He's kinda loud and hilarious, and has the Chicagoest accent ever. He meets with us every day, and we tell him about our meetings with our assigned patients, and he writes down things and laughs at us for making silly mistakes. Ah well. Even better still is his avoidance of doing the Asshole Doctor Thing.   The Asshole Doctor Thing, or ADT for short, is when people who are supposed to be hired to teach you things get very irritated when you ask them questions about things, or, god forbid, as a student, you don't know something, and dismiss you as though you should never have passed the 10th grade. These are the types who will tell you "don't worry about it" because the  real  answer requires precisely 17 more neurons than you possess. The types who answer your question without looking at you because, well, your question doesn't deserve eye contact. Not all doctors do it, in fact, most good doctors don't. And you don't have to be a doctor to do it. But that's the ADT. Dr. Ravitz doesn't do that. In fact, he does things like say, "make sure you don't forget this, because this is very important." Even when you mess  shit up. Now that's teaching.  Our resident fellows in Child Psychiatry are pretty cool as well. There's Angela, the savvy British doctor who also manages to speak Spanish and take our calls in the middle of the night. I haven't worked with her a bunch, but she seems swell.   I've just begun working with Julie, who comes off as the most on top of her game. She wears the cute plastic glasses, and walks around being all Asian and sweet and smart. And she let me present a new patient today. She seems great!  Kourosh is the one I've worked with most of the time. He's one of these guys who reeks of high school nerd, but is now super smooth, helpful, psychiatry man. Or maybe he's grown up high school nerd...who can tell? If he really is grown-up nerd, then we'll know by the fact that I will have fallen in love with him by the end of the rotation. Either that, or I'll catch him wearing an XL t-shirt (this man is not an XL) tucked into his jeans shorts on the weekend or something. He refers to his fianc√© as an "awesome, awesome girl". He's  that  psychiatrist who wears his hair in a ponytail. And he gives me hope, despite his latent nerdiness, that doctors can be normal people. With "awesome, awesome" lovers.  They all do. And the ADT is absent from ALL of them.  I would love to tell all kinds of stories about the patients we see, because, let me tell you, there are lots of stories. But I would be violating some sacred ethical obligation, and some thingie called the hippocratic oath (or was that HIPAA?). But suffice it to say that the kids don't want to be there, and they don't always understand enough to believe that you're helping them. I mean, we're talking frank psychosis here. But, most of the people we see at CLSH wind up loads better when they leave than when they came in, and that's something. What's also great is that this is the one field in medicine where it is not efficacious to buzz in and out of as many patients' rooms as possible. It is required to sit down and talk with the patients. That's also a great feeling.  Frankly, I'm worried that the rest of the year won't be nearly as cool as this rotation. But I'll find someone's ass to kiss, that's for sure.
