It was for this reason (and others) that at the age of thirteen I taught myself to ride a unicycle.    Most of my friends were riding tricked out BMX bikes (I ran mine under a truck the year before) or racing around on super-light skateboards (mine came from the previous skateboard generation, was made of metal and had clay wheels -- no kidding!). So I figured that doing something that hardly anyone else could do would set me apart just far enough to remove any suspicion of normality.  My friend Kerry also rode one wheel and so we became almost inseparable throughout that seventh grade school year. We rode to school, we rode to the park, we rode to the store on the weekends. One Spring morning we showed up to school with handle bars and a bicycle wheel between us -- a  tricycle , get it?  So it was with great pleasure that, for the occasion of my 38th birthday, I grasped desperately for a retreating youth in the form of another unicycle. This one is much nicer than the one I had as a child -- 24" wheel, longer cranks and a trick handle at the front of the seat for acrobatics.  It has been said that you never forget how to ride a bicycle; it always comes back to you no matter how long it has been since your previous ride. The same can be said of unicycling. However another phrase came to mind today as I wobbled on one wheel for the first time in 25 years, "Youth is wasted on the young." OUCH! I used muscles in my legs that I had forgotten were there! Even as I type this I can feel my legs shaking.  My plan is to work up enough endurance to get all the way to work (1 mile) and back each day. I can never be 13 again, but I can at least approach some semblance of fitness in my "old" age.
