I start taking the test, and I like how Mr. Reem sets it up. He is a really cool and a very good teacher, haven't had one of those for awhile now. So its good to have him. But his test, we were given a time limit. And I really cut it short. I was like 2 minutes away from the one hour time limit. I wasn't the last one done though! So that made me feel better lol. One girl just took forever, and after I was done, we got a break, and she never came back from the break for a long time. So I'm guessing he gave her extra time to finish. But after the test he gave us a whole hour and let us right fake laws. It actually was pretty interesting. Except for Roxanne who refused to let me write a law with her. I guess I'm not cool enough to write a law with Roxanne, I see how it is! No you're awesome Roxanne don't worry. But then he let us out like 5 minutes early, so me and Kayla went out and I walked her half way down the road while I waited for my mom to come pick me up. She did, and then I came home. I really didn't do anything at home. Just listened to music. Then I called Andrew and asked if he wanted to go play basketball with me at Taylors. So I walked over there, and then it started to rain, but we didn't care so we headed off to Taylors. We got there, and were wet so, we still wanted to play because we were already wet and so why not get more wet lol? So we went out there and they both kicked my butt in Xylophone and Pianist. Yeah you heard me right! Xylophone and Pianists. Thats what kinda of basketball games us bandos play. The we played some music, and I watched Andrew and Taylor play for a little. And then me and Taylor watched Andrew teach soccer to Taylors brothers and sisters. But, then Andrew ran into a tree, and you can fill in the rest from there. Lol you're a smart one arn't you buddy? Those trees just fly out from nowhere. Then Taylor had to go get ready so me and Andrew walked home. Then I got home, and made my family breakfast food for dinner. You got to love when that happens. I love breakfast food for dinner, its so different. Because it's breakfast, at dinner time! WOW! Amazing right? Yeah thought so. Well then I just kinda did nothing. But then my parents asked if I wanted to go on a drive with them. So I did, and we went to really cool places that I didn't even know excisted in Washington. They were really far out in the country, and they were huge houses. I want to live there. They were probably around 10 minutes away from town, they are that far out. I like that. We took our dog along to, so I played with her in the car. She is still soar from getting fixed though. Poor girl, that shouldn't be legal, cutting out her stuff like that. Ewwy! Well after our driving we got home, and I got online and talked to Amanda. I said I would talk about her in this. Because she is just one of the coolest people in the world! I'm taking forever to type this lol. I'm sorry :-). Well really thats all I have to say. I'm tired, but its the weekend, so who goes to bed on the weekends? Oh yeah, I do sometimes, oh well. See-ya later!
