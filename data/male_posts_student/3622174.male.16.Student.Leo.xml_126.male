I'm feeling not my best today, either... so I'm really, really tired.  I'm going to get the work done that I promised, and then I may fall asleep again.  I've got no plans for the Fourth of July, so I can get it done.  There's only 2 weeks from tomorrow until my vacation starts...the first four days are going to be spent with my yearbook staff, at our annual summer workshop thing.  Then, I have one day at home before I head up to New York (by car, which blows).  I think I mentioned yesterday that I'm stopping at the Paramount Carowinds park in North Carolina, and then, after I visit my family, we're going to the Six Flags in Darien Lake up there. So, from July 19-August 2nd, basically, expect a lot of Audioblog of Bagel posts (the first one is tonight), but no bagel.tech.  By the way, if you haven't been there since I reopened it, take a look at it, because it looks a lot better with that new design.  I have no idea how I'm going to keep up with blogging once school starts.  It'll probably happen where I won't be able to have a post every day, and I don't want that to happen!  The Blogger is too addicting, even when you have no life!    Well, then.  I'm going to get to work on the minor construction that's going to be taking place.  Remember, this place is getting an all new comment system, and other addons as I find them, so check back later today to interact with the site in its new form.  To get a preview of the new commenting system and some of the tweaked features, check out bagel.tech, as it's already completed (but no new design here).  So, until later today, adios.
