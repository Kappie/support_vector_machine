But I'm drunk...sobering up, but keeping myself drunk mentally in order to write this.    Color Day 1997.  Mr. Krueger came out onto the dance floor after a 15-minute 80s block of music (where, because of my fond love of 80s and dancing, proceeded to throw my jacket and tie off, ride around on Daniel Harr's shoulders, and make out with Bonnie Bridges on the dance floor...all whilst completely sober), pulled me aside, and talked to me about Joe Rodriguez, who was drunk and at the dance, and who was about to get kicked out.  He tried to compare myself to Joe, not wanting me to become the drunk guy at the Rogers High School Color Day Dance (which honestly sucked, except that my girlfriend wore a bodacious dress and they played 15 minutes of authentic 80s in a block between other shit).  I didn't listen.  I was just happy to be there, naive to what drunk was.    The last paragraph was edited for spelling.  I am pretty blitzed, so this next paragraph will be typed as is...  I lied.  Maybe this one, if I don't sound like a total ass.    I hadn't seen BOnnie in over )(actually almost_)six years.  We dated for eleven moths in high school ()though she'll tell you ten, but i'm better with dates)_, fighting a lot but usually having a damn good night when we were together.  I don't know why we didn't talk before....out break-up was pretty bad (actuall yreally bad, just that I hada worse break-pu with someone else, so I never consider the one with Bonnie so bad because it was six years ago, but it was stilly righteously bad), and wby the time we were cool with each other, she was in school, i was in school, and i no longer came to Arkansas when i was onv acation.  So this was the first time since she was a junior in high school.  Now she is perparning to be a second-year law student.    Teh thunderstorm outside is glorious.  I stood in it for several minutes before coming inside, just watching.  The knowledge of security, yet the ability to compromise it, is the reason a storm can be so wonderful at night.  You are palying with fear if you go out, but you can just sleep with it raging, knowing wit will never come to get you  You are safe at home, it is just thunder, beautiful and melodic.  Thunder won't take you away at night.  It won't do mchu to your house.  You can jsut listen, see the periodic flashes of light, and cuddle up in the blanket, smiling about how you can overcome nature.    Too druynk to know what i'm writing, but still coherent enough to realize not to edit this thing for grammatical errors, and hoping all readers will overlook my atrocious content choices.  Bonnie looked great tonight.  Katie looked good yesterday at lunch, but there was something about Bonnie...maybe it was because Katie had a sinus infection, maybe it was because I hadn't seen Bonnie in so long, but I wasn't too attracted to Katie yesterday, whereas Bonnie embodied attractive at the bars we were at.  And I'm harmless, for the most part, and that is a total lie.  I consider myself harmless, and I really am, but I live with my thoughts, and in the back of my mind I wished on a star that for one night we could forget about six years of life that brought us to where we are, forget about the six most important years of my life, the six most formulaic years of my life that weened me into the conscious, independent, considerate, kind-hearted, all-good-cliche person that I am today...I wanted to forget that, and for one night be back in high school, knowing what i know now, with a Bonnie who had the same righteous indignation, the same bitchiness, the same strong attitude...i wanted one last night of that.  in the storm.  enjoying her.  forget physicalness.  just a night in that old room off of raven st, listening to the rotund one on magif 107.9, candles lit, both of us on the bed, her head on my shoulder, arm around my wasit, slowly scratching my side and belly, talking.  Sex would be glorious too.  But it's not about that.  I'd get sex if I truly needed it.  Maybe I wanted the past again, the times when I was innocent, when I protected her and she protected me, and I lived in Rogers, and Rogers was the world, and everything outside of Rogers didn't matter, because what was outisde of Rogers?  What I saw I knew, and I wanted to change the world, and it didn't seem that hard because the world was less than 100,000 people packed into 60 miles of land between Misourri and Fayetteville.  Those wer ethe days of true idealism, and I spent that with Bonnie.    It wasn't just idealism, though.  I wanted a part of me back.  A part that she has.  Flann O'Brien wrote a great book called THE THIRD POLICEMAN (too drunk to link), where he philosophized that people and their possessions became one in the same...if a man rides a bike for years, part of him ends up on that bike...molecules trade places...part of the bike enters him, and he enters part of the bike, and the two are interchangeable, and he and the bike will always have a kindred relationship...even if the bike is stolen, the vagrant will not get far, because the bike will not react well, considering the man he stole it from is part of the bike.    I feel bad, because eerything i remember about the relationship is selfish...a side people show after years of hiding emotions, putting things away, considering life with an analytical lens.  But here's the moment of kindness:  I was sitting on the Empire State Building, floor 88, looking over the ledge at the world below.  I was 17, with a few friends, living the dream of any teenager...freedom in one of the world's greatest cities.  I reveled in it, walking aroud the parameter, wide-eyed, taking in the glow of flourescent nightlife everywhere I could.  At one turn, I ran into a young couple, the age that I am now.  He was holding her, and they were looking out at Staten Island, a small light in the distance, surrounded by Lady Liberty and nothing but black.  He slid his hand down her shoulder and locked his hand with hers.  At that point, I missed Bonnie.  I had missed her lots before, owing most to insecurity of myself and my low self image at the time, but this was the first time I missed her because I wanted her to see something, to share something, to be a part of something that I was experiencing.  It was sad that she wasn't with me; it was a travesty that she couldn't see the view, not only of the ocean, but of the couple, and the couple with the ocean.  I turned on my tape recorder I had brought in order to take notes for a newspaper article, and wrote Bonnie my first impromptu letter about the view, only talking about what I saw.  Heather Decker listened to the tape in order to write the story, and never gave it back.    i'm not mourning, and i'm not living in the past.  i wake up tomorrow, and it's a new day, i've got lots of things to do.  but there are a few things.  one, it's both great and tough to see an old friend grow up and do so well and seem to have so much under control when you feel like much of your security is a facade; two, you wonder why you haven't found the happnies while they have; three, you wonder why ever girl you ever dated is now dating a guy named Chris; four, you had a great night, you are sitting up at a comuter, with a little time to talk, a little drunk, a lot ready to pass out, and you are mixing the past memories with the present desires and future plans, all because that's what you have in front of you.  The funny thing about seeing an ex is that while you can remember all of the good, find all the nostalgia, and wonder what may have happened (maybe even wish for it), at the same time she is throwing at you all of the things you like to forget...all of the low points that you pretend no one saw, that were just you dicking around alone.  In many ways it's good to be reminded.  In others it's not.
