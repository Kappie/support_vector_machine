Supposedly anything can be called a fad so my being upset about fads falling on me is just a fad and will pass. But that would mean that I am an actual fad-follower. But if I ignore the fads and act like they're not there, then I'm screwed too because that   could   also be considered fad-like behavior. I could also just not mind being called a fad-follower, or being misunderstood, but that's not me. It seems that the only option for people who don't want to be associated with fads or their followers is to just join the crowd of mindless, culture-less, and uncreative zombies that follow what their parents and peers tell them to and to not be bothered by being apart of the group. I am now very sad. I am sure it will pass within the half-hour though.  That is all.         -- Feanor
