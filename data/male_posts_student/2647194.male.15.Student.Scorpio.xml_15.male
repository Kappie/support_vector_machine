It's pretty sad when you're weekends are as day-in, day-out similar as the normal school days are. I still have my cold, which has been with me for well over a week now. They really need to invent an instant-action rotitussin or something.  ReCaP: Friday: The lip-synch contest was quite interesting this time around. Much better than I had expected. As always, there were the cliched (my computer won't do accents...grrr) and overdone performances of stupid pop songs. Firstly, there was only one of these (thank god), but yes, there was a massive group of girls dancing to a sh$tty pop song. And they used POMPOMS!!!! AHHH! Needless to say, they weren't even close to being in the top 3.  Funniest performance: Matt Hermes performes "Internet Help desk", when the music suddenly changes to "I'm too sexy", and a few guys come in and start pushing him around and dancing. Matt Hermes didn't know that was going to happen, so he got pissed.  Best performances (in my opinion): 1. "Time Warp", from Rocky Horror Picture Show, done by Ian LaForge, Sheila Nezhad, Dan Mensen, and Leah Frichol. An encore performance was included at the end. 2. Andrew Kotz and Erik Gryska performed, and quite well actually, the classic rock song "Bohemian Rhapsody", by Queen. I was surprised that they didn't win anything. 3. "The Belly-button song", done by Sam Speckhard, Mary Speckhard, Lisa Speckhard, and (I'm sorry) a few others who I forgot the names of at the moment. This one wasn't my favorite, but it was funny nonetheless.  Worst performance: "Wonderful World", I think that's what it was called, but it was the last performance for the day other than the teachers' performance. Steve Hutt and Jared Foster weren't particularly animated, and they used a digital projector.  On Friday night, I went over to Dylans, and discovered that I suck really horribly at DDR.  Saturday: My attempts to gather enough strength to get my chores done and go skiing failed me, and I ended up losing to Derrick in Starcraft after about 2.5 hours of back and fourth air battles. And yes, it is possible to beat 3 boards of Halo in 3 hours. Even when the boards are 343 Guilty Spark, the Library, and Two Betrayals. It's even possible to skip the final large battle in Two Betrayals by gunning in with a ghost, and flinging yourself into a banshee and hoping you don't get a plasma grenade stuck on you.  Sunday: This was "go to Church, do chores, do homework, and no time for anything else" day.  Blah, blah, and blah. I wish the snow would either magically turn to skiable snow, or go away all together so I can go biking. One or the other.  My comments on Ralph Nader: He's an egotistical candidate, and all he is doing is hurting the democratic party by taking away very liberal democratic votes. A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. I wish he wouldn't run...it's going to be like the last election DAMMIT!  "I know a charm that will heal with a touch. "I know a charm that will turn aside the weapons of an enemy. "I know another charm to free myself from all bonds and locks. "A fifth charm: I can catch an arrow in flight and take no harm from it." His words were quiet, urgent. Gone was the hectoring tone, gone was the grin. Wednesday spoke as if he were reciting the words of a religious ritual, or remembering something dark and painful. "A sixth: spells sent to hurt me will hurt only the sender. "A seventh charm I know: I can quench a fire simply by looking at it. "An either: if any man hates me, I can win his friendship. "A ninth: I can sing to the wind to sleep and calm a storm for long enough to bring a ship to shore. "Those were the first nine charms I learned. Nine nights I hung on the bare tree, my side pierced with a spear's point. I swayed and blew in the cold winds and the hot winds, without food, without water, a sacrifice of myself to myself, and the worlds opened to me. "For a tenth charm, I learned to dispel witches, to spin them around in the skies so that they will never find their way back to their own homes. "An eleventh: if I sing it when a battle rages it can take warriors through the tumult unscathed and unhurt, and bring them safely back to their hearths and their homes. "A twelfth charm I know: if I see a hanged man I can bring him down from the gallows to whisper to us all he remembers. "A thirteenth: if I sprinkle water on a child's head, that child will never fall in battle. "A fourteenth. I know the names of all the gods. Every damned one of them. "A fifteenth: I have a dream of power, of glory, and of wisdom, and I can make people believe my dreams." His voice was so low now that Shadow had to strain to hear it over the plane's engine noise. "Sixteenth charm I know: if I need love I can turn the mind and heart of any woman. "A seventeenth, that no woman I want will ever want another. "And I know an eighteenth charm, and that charm is the greatest of all, and that charm I can tell to no man, for a secret that no one knows but you is the most powerful secret there can ever be."  ~~Exerpt from American Gods, by Neil Gaiman.
