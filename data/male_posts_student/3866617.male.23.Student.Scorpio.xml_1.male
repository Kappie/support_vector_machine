It feels more like Chinese water torture but in a slower more appeal attire.  It is always in my putt putt shirt, I never feel this way when I am working with my band.  I guess that I shouldn't complain because I have a better job than most college kids.  I work with some people that have become some of my best friends, but for every single up there is a down, strikes and gutters, you know?  Well, I am excited that the Astros won today!  It is about time, they need to get the ball rolling, because that is my team for the world series this year.  They have the artillery, the talent, the pitching, and my support which is the best of all.  I think that it is funny that people are so worried about the trivial things in life too.  I often to talk to some of the people in high school, mostly girls, and it reminds me of being in high school again.  Being 23 years old and out of high school for going on 6 years, makes me realize how much I have changed in a lot of aspects of my life.  It also reinforces the morals that I have about dating people that are too much younger than me, or not experienced in life in general.  The talk to me about their proms, their "boy problems", being in Love.   Ha... Love!  That is the funniest term that a junior in high school can toss at me.  I talk to a college girl that I work with, who doesn't go to college and talks often to me about a guy that she is "destined to marry," she tells me that "God told her that they were going to marry one another."  What a load.  They have broken up like 8 times, it seems like they would get a hint.  The saddest part about it is that I have a friend that is into this girl and it seems like she would like him, but won't give him a chance because she doesn't see this atrocity that is seemingly perpetual.  He is a good guy that would treat her like a princess yet, she would rather be heart-broken ever now and again by this guy while she sometimes breaks up with him.  I guess second chances just aren't enough sometimes.  Well I talk a lot about nothing, so I guess that I will keep writing from day to day.
