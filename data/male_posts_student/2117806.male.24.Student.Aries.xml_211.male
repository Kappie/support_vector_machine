I've got roughly thirteen or fourteen hours' worth of useful time on my hands during which to get my second draft of the Master's Thesis completed. I will have it done before I go to bed tonight. I'm getting my playlist set (I want there to be plenty of tunes for this so I don't get bored with the music that's playing), I'm clearing away my workspace, and I'm preparing my mind for churning out history. Wish me luck.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "Gagging Order"
