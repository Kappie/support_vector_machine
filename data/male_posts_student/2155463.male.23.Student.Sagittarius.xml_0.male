Seriously, all these random philosophical questions just keep coming up, and the damning part is that I can't seem to answer any of them.  So I'm stuck just trying to sort them out, trying to find some reason within my madness...and I get so fatigured that I just decide to try to stop thinking, something which obviously isn't the greatest for the my studying during such periods :-P  But even when I try to rest I can't stop thinking...my mind is like a freaking engine that I just can't shut down...so not only do I get mentally fatigued, but physically too (b/c I can't get to sleep b/c I'm thinking...).  And I get so withdrawn...it just seems like everything folds inward.  I've pretty much learned to keep my mouth shut when I get like that (and when I'm really tired)...while I probably say my most insightful and truthful things when I like that, I also end up saying a lot of things that I don't really think through or didn't really want to be known.  But when I don't say anything I feel even more withdrawn, which makes me angry with myself, which makes me more determined not to open my mouth so I don't say anything stupid...I think you can see the cycle there.  It's really frustrating.  And the worst thing is that even when I capture a positive thought, a positive moment, a logical stream, I just can't escape the sense of hopelessness and loneliness.  Sometimes I wonder if it all isn't just philosophical / theological...whether these kinds of moments expose the true realities of life, either that there isn't a God and life is truly nihilistic, or that there is a God and I'm just not committed enough to finding out who He is.  And it seems that all I can do is try to wait it out...I haven't found anything that really helps me get out of these funks...  Grr...the last couple of months were so good, I thought I was getting over this...  Anyway...now that I've rambled on about how weird I am, on to more important things.  I got my resume finished last night and started to work on my cover letter for my internships, so now I need to start figuring out which places I want to work at.  This could be a tough decision - on the one hand I want to work with someplace that's relatively particular to Washington and which has the same beliefs that I do (like a Christian advocacy group or something), but on the other hand I want to work with a group that is in the field of law I want to go into (like an inner-city law firm or something).  Who knows, maybe I'll find something that's both...?  Oh, and just as a little tag-on here, I think I finally figured out the most basic theological question that keeps tripping me up - "Why did God create humans with  full knowledge  that the vast majority would reject Him and spend eternity in Hell?"  I just can't get over this...if anyone has any good answers to this, let me know...
