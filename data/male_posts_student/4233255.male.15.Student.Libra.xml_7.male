Goody... >_> Hopefully I'll have time to either go mini-golfing or see Collateral. Speaking of which, that movie looks freakin' awesome. I love intelligent thrillers and badarses so it looks to be a great flick. Some of my friends confirm this, so I have to see it! ^_^    Gah...I still have some homework to catch up on, and then that stupid collage, but I just want to kick back! It's not fair!!!!!! I mean, I know it's just the first week and all, but I seriously dislike (not hate =P) North Springs. I mean, you know there's a problem when your only new friend is a teacher! XD    Oh well, back to work so I can finish this stuff in time to DO SOMETHING! Later....
