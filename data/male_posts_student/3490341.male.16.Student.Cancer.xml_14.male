I am quite proud to be the creator of these sites andif i can update as often as i am planning i will be really happy. Now has come the low after the high of doing many things at once. I'm a bit bored but am looking forward to tomorrow morning because im going to visit the north yorkshire show to give out prgrammes and make a bit of money for the explorer scouts. Should be able to have a look around aswell. Better go now, The Parole Officer is starting and i've heard its quite funny Toodles  (Edit: Sorry this was posted late,i fergot to post it after wachin the film, which i can assure you is helarious-review coming on movie rack-)
