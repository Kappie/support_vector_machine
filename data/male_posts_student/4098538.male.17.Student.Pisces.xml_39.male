We just spent the whole time lying around, doing nothing (which, by the way, is better than doing anything else)! I feel I really have to better myself though. There are a lot of things I do wrong. It is mainly due to stubborness and jealousy on my behalf (which is really silly, but in a way it does show I care). I am not letting this relationship go, so I will better myself to make it continue. xx
