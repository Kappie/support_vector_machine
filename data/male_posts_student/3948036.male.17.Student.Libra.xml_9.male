Well I got back to Korgen this morning after two days in Mosjoen, where I played tennis, watched TV and played tennis. I was supposed to buy my own racket so I didn't have to borrow from my friends all the time, but the one racket they had in stock at the sportshop was waaaaay too expensive for me. I however got another racket ordered which will be at a nicer prize. Can't wait till i get my paws on it next week, or maybe I should say the week after next week, because you know what happens next week don't you? Oya-festivalen, baby! Yeah! This weekend I'm going to chill because the festival will be maximum stress. Me and my bro will have to run between scenes to get to see the bands we want to see, but it will all be in good fun... I hope.  My friend went to London today(or should I say yesterday?) and he's going to get me one of those "My friend went to..." t-shirts. Woohoo. Does fake enthusiasm show in typing? Not that that 'woohoo' was spawned in fake enthusiasm or anything... Heh.  There's the kid with the golden arm / He admits to forest fire That started off from the lack of / Something better going on.  I'm not sure if my way of showing that this is a song lyric is correct but anyway, that's taken from my favorite-song at the moment, which will appear(yet again) in Song Of The Day.  Song Of The Day:  Pretty Girls Make Graves - All Medicated Geniuses   Such a spectacular song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)(¤%/("=!T#§!  Later peeps  (My countdown is currently inactive seeing as I can't remember how many days are left before I'm going)  Moo
