We really do have no reason to be in Iraq, September 11th in a way was really Bush's fault, and we live in fear almost all the time because of false accustations being thrown around in the media. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  I hung out with my friend Nick from New Jersey. Didn't really do much. We went to Taco Bell and hoped to find some people to play basketball. I didn't get a chance to play because I went to the movies. That was my day.
