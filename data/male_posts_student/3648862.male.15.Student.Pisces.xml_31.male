My mom might move to Louisiana, and if she does I might move with her. I need a new town to move to, then I can forget about all the people I've grown to love and hate. I'll also meet some new people, maybe some guys like me. I think I might be over Ryan, now that I've been away from him for a month. Who knows, I'll find out when I see him again. Well, I'll try to post again soon. TTYl
