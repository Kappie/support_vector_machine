I first meet these bunch of kids in feb....Seems like yesterday when i first took them...When i first met them...they moved and adjust in a platoon....talk and talk...these kids don't have respect for me...but then...i never once gave up on them...everytime drag their boots...t-shirts tucked out...Bing Hao never stopped smiling...together with Ee Shi and Galvin...but i don't blame them..they are still new...i can feel that they are special...in some way or another...it doesn't matter...times passes...everytime training Spencer doesn't come for training...Kay Liang and a whole lot bunch of people...Everytime i looked at them...they reminded me of me whenI was in secondary 1 in NCC...reaching may and june...attendence begin to increase...of course it is everyone's effort...but as time passes...words like "No!...Don't adjust !...Very Good!...Know it Down" became my common terms with them...Everyday...i've wished that i could step down as fast as possible...but today...after 3PM...i changed my mind...i wish i could have more time with them....The Alpha Platoon...so Guys...don't disappoint me....Do your best...I have high hopes for everyone of you all....
