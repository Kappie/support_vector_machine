I found a really cool website that lets you have free tracking on your website, as well as a free guestbook. Why is it so cool? Because I didn't have to code any of it myself, and since I'm lazy that is good for me. I just got a hit counter and a guest book, both at the bottom of the page. I'm not sure whether I'll get anything else, but for now, that's all. I'll update later then.  Guess what? My vampire name is Driretlan: Driretlan is your Vampire name. You are a witty Vampire with a certain style that others are drawn to.

You represent... loneliness. Always alone and always sad about it... unlike angst, you don't have to look for a reason to be miserable.  You want to be in the company of people but aren't sure how to act when you're with them.  Sometimes you have to make an effort.  You can't always wait for others to come to you.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    That's about all for now I think.  --Raine
