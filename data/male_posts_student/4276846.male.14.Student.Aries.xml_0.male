I had breakfast and then we left our cousin's house. When I arrived home I went on the web (checking and writing my blog) and talked to my friend Sean Fong (his blog is   urlLink  http://brainynerd.blogspot.com    ).  After I had finished talking to Sean, I watched the 3rd Semifinal of Australian Idol. The judges were very nice even Ian 'Dicko' Dickson, the nasty, mean judge. Due to them being nice it was quite boring to watch as I like the judges being nasty to untalented or talented singers who do not sing very well.  After that I had an early night as it was a school night and I was quite tired.  Until tomorrow   C'ya
