The man continues to flip through the channels, “Same old, same old…” Something catches his eye on the channel: E!.  He listens to the introduction:   “Next on: E!: True Hollywood Stories!  Andrew Schultz: friend, musician, and family man tells his life story once and for all, on a newly found tape he recorded before he died.  Listen to his story next!”   	“Alright!  Old what’s-his-face!  I remember that guy!  I think I got one of his old CDs up in the attic…” The man says.  He yells up to his son that is playing in his room, “Hey, Son!  You want a real history lesson!?  This guy they are doing a thing on TV was really cool back in my day!”  The man’s son yells back down, “No thanks, dad!  I am busy playing Playstation 26!”   The son says to himself, “Yea right, like I would want to see something that my lame dad was into when he was a kid…Grown-ups are so  out-of-date .”  	The dad runs into the kitchen and grabs some popcorn.  He hops down in his chair, “Oh man, it’s starting…this is going to be  ghetto-fabulous !”                           E!: True Hollywood Story:  The Lost Tape of Andrew Schultz  	I came into this world on June 10, 1988.  Supposedly, it was a “beautiful miracle of life” that was actually quite gruesome.  My mom was probably begging somebody to hit her with a bat to distract her from the pain of her “most beautiful experience of her life”.  This, I bet, was my first traumatizing experience of my interesting life.  I was born in Providence Hospital in Southfield.  However, I grew up in the boring, inescapable, h-e-double hockey stick hole we like to call: Livonia.  	I attended Hull Elementary School.  It was a very odd school that was full of teachers that either owned framed pictures of Bates, or they smoked pipes outside during recess secretly, or would chase you around the room trying to kiss you (I was actually kissed by this crazy teacher, sad to say).  I did well in school for the most part, getting A’s and B’s.  My mom-being a teacher- and my dad-being a part’s auditor for GM- made me feel the need to be a perfectionist because my mom expected good grades, and my dad just yelled a lot.  	Around the age of eight, we got a pop-up camper.  Ah yes, family bonding…(*vomits*).  We went on many trips including Yellowstone National Park and Maine.  A few of the highlights were: being cramped in either a camper or car with my sister and parents, ten hour car rides, and having to sleep next to my dad that snores a lot at night and finds much humor out of releasing of internal gases.  	I wasn’t really in to music in elementary school until I picked up a guitar in sixth grade.  I played in the elementary school band as the only guitarist.  The rest of the band included: ten clarinet players, eight keyboardists, three percussionists, three or four trumpets, one trombone, and one ukulele (yes, the little Hawaiian guitar-type instrument).  That’s right, we were a ghetto band.  I soon found myself and my other classmates moving on to middle school.  This was the time frame in which I was searching for my character and style.  	Throughout middle school, I wanted to be prep, sadly.  I followed this witty, sarcastic, self-centered bunch for a month or so until I realized they probably weren’t even smart enough to prepare a Pop-Tart© without having to read the instructions on the side of the box.  Meanwhile, I continued on the path of music by starting to play trombone in the middle school band, and I continuing to play guitar outside of school.  	My good friend, Ben Peters, played bass guitar outside of school (also the lad that played the ukulele in the said elementary school band, but he gave it up though).  We came to a conclusion that our musical talent (or lack of it) would get us nowhere fast by ourselves.  So we decided to join forces, and make a crummy band that might get us somewhere, and hopefully some girlfriends.  We had a drummer at one point, but he got kicked out for undisclosed reasons.  (As I progress through the story, keep in mind Ben and I are still trying to form a band through out it.)  So, middle school passed like a flash.  Boys and girls start turning from kids into kids that are a little taller, have cracked voices, and have curly hairs in new places.  	The summer after middle school I did marching band (big mistake).  Standing at attention for twenty minutes, marching everyday in the heat, and having to wear those stupid uniforms in front of your friends that now have pop shooting out of their noses from laughing at you were always fun experiences.  Around this time I got horrible news. 	               My parents got divorced.  Eventually, under all the stress of school, the divorce, and relationships, I drove towards the path of sex, drugs and rock and roll, without the drugs, and, unfortunately, without the sex.  I got very involved in punk, emo, and ska music in my freshman year.  I also started going to the thrift store and got my own style of clothes.  Then, some good started coming back to my life.  	Late in the freshman year, Ben and I recruited Mike Sochalski as our drummer.  We got ourselves a name for the band as well: Just For You.  As we started writing songs, I started going to counseling.  No, I wasn’t crazy (maybe a little); I was just a little overwhelmed.  	Summer came once again after ninth grade of course.  I found my first love, but promptly got dumped at the end of the summer which is always fun, as you would expect.  I also quit marching band (I loved marching around in full uniform until my feet hurt really bad, but I decided it was just time to call it quits).  With the extra time, Just For You continued to practice hard through the summer, and we got lots of songs done.  	With the sophomore year starting, I continued to distance myself from my parents.  I was convinced that if it wasn’t for my curly head of hair that I share with my mom, I was probably either adopted or dropped down on Earth by aliens (I am still trying to contact them to see if they will take me back).  I was nothing like them; I couldn’t really stand them either.  I am sure every teenager feels this way about their parents because everybody has that one parent (or both parents) that is either very odd, annoying, strict, not street smart, inappropriate, corny, embarrassing, not accepting to new technology/customs ( remember hearing this: “we don’t need digital cable!” or the classic, “Your own car?!  When we were kids we would walk fifteen miles to school, uphill both ways!”),  ill-tempered, non-internet savvy, or over-protective.  Some teenagers, like myself, have parents that have more than one of these qualities.  So, I just tried to find as many excuses as I could to get out of the house.  	In fall, my band finished our first CD.  We also started performing at small music halls, and local record stores.  People went insane for our band.  Our shows would be packed, people even having to sit outside because the fire marshal wouldn’t let anymore people in because we went over the maximum people limit of the buildings we were playing at.  Girls loved us, and guys wanted to be like us.  At school, we would be chased down for autographs, and girls would faint whenever we looked at them (and they weren’t fainting from how ugly we were like it used to be).  After sophomore year, we went on our first tour.  It was a huge success.  We covered most of the east coast of the US, and soon everybody was talking about Just For You.  	As junior year started, we opened for bands like NOFX and the Suicide Machines.  We were getting really well known, and as the junior year ended we were invited to play on the Warped Tour.  We were the youngest group to ever be on the Warped Tour, but it was because we were so good.  On the warped tour at one of our last stops, Comerica Park, I met a real cool punk chick when I jumped off the stage into the crowd, and she was one of the people that caught me and pushed me back on stage.  I met with her after the show, and we really hit it off.  	Years pass by and we got married when I was twenty-five.  We moved into a house on Lake Michigan, and started a family.  Just For You took a short break for us to get our lives together, but with the fans getting anxious for us to release another album, the band members and I finally met together, and started making music again.  	Life for me pretty much stayed the same for a long time.  Writing music, recording it, sending it out, and going on tours is all we did.  Soon, we realized we were getting to old for this when at one show I threw out my back while jumping in the air.  To the horror of our idolizing and loving fans, Just For You called it quits when I was thirty-seven.  I took the extra time to start writing books.  I wrote on politics, current events, and basically anything I had a strong opinion on.  Of course, the books sold like crazy.  While writing these books, I started my own record label: Warped Records (I don’t know if this is an actually record label already).  Many bands signed up to be on Warped Records, and it became one of the most successful record companies ever made.  	So, here I am sitting at the age of seventy-nine recording this audiocassette tape still in the house on Lake Michigan.  My life as you can now see, was very well lived and fruitful.  I hope someday somebody will hear this, and everyone will know my story.  Whoops, there goes my alarm for me to take my pills, good-bye!                                                        Epilogue The E! True Hollywood Story sums up the personal narrative:   “Then at age eighty, Andrew was driving my Corvette down the highway, speeding as usual.  He was returning from the mall where he shoplifted many things.  He knew that nobody would suspect an eighty-year-old man would steal something, and besides he didn’t have much to lose anyways.  Anyways, he was driving along on a  highway in Michigan.  Then, he hit a pothole (No, they never did fix the pothole problem in Michigan) doing about ninety miles per hour, and then he flipped my Corvette.  He died instantly.  	Millions of people mourned the loss of him that day.  His fans, his friends, his family, and even his ex-girlfriends that wished they had never dumped him back when they were teenagers.  That day was also made an international holiday, and there was no school on that day either.  Nobody ever did forget him, and all of his accomplishments.  	So, there you have it.  That is how Andrew Schultz turned from a nobody to a somebody just because he decided to pick up that guitar in sixth grade.  Feel free to go grab a tissue now to wipe away your tears of amazement.”   The man said, “that was a great documentary, and that tape of his personal narrative was amazing.”  He paused to eat more popcorn, and then he added, “I bet if Andrew Schultz turned in something like that for an English paper, he would have gotten an  A+!  Ha ha!”  (*Wink, wink, nudge, nudge*).       Please give me your thoughts on this narrative, and if there are any errors tell me ASAP, cause....it's due tomorrow...
