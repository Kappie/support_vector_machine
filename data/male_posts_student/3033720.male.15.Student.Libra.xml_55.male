But who knows, maybe we can work something out. Also this thing with that girl I was talking about earlier (her name is Brittany) is getting more and more confusing. I don't know her well, and I would really like to get to know her better and then see how that goes and go from there, but I don't know if her friends are gonna let that happen. I just wish I knew what was so horrible about me or what I did...Anyhow, I'm the old me again. We will see how this all works out....and I really hope it works out where I can make everybody happy, but it seems like if it makes me happy, no one else is. I guess that's it for now. I'll keep you guys posted. People just need to mind their own business.....Check back tonight for an audio post, it may be late, but I wanna try to make one from Jared's birthday party. I'm out.
