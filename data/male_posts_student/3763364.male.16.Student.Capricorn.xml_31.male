We're fucking discpicable.   Right now, some of us are more concerned about our boy/girlfriends, the nail we just broke, or our turning a profit. This is the world! This is the fucking world!   This is more than horrible. We raped an pillaged this earth for some cash, and now we destroy each other with chemicals and words and wars. For paper. For little green pieces of god damned paper.   Do you remember when Canada tried to conform to the Kyoto protocol?  Do you remember when Ralph Klein said "NO TO KYOTO"!?  He said that it would hurt the oil industry in Alberta and cost thousands of jobs.   Well he's right, it would cost thousands of jobs. But there isn't going to be a place to work your stupid god damned jobs if there isn't an earth to live on, is there!? Dumbass.  The world is not a happy place, filled with love and flowers and candy. The world is terrible. The world is dying.  We are the cause.  Humanity is the problem.  I am, you are.  We all are.  We took this earth and ruined it.  Now we ruin each other.  The world is filled with poison and hurt and death.  Not just emotional, now, is it?  The world, it fucking burns to the ground at our hands.  Sitting here now, I am not part of the solution.  The world is littered with demons,  But nobody cares.  They just blend right in.  Chaos.  Destruction.  End.  Burn the world in two.  Burn to burn.  Burn it to be happy.  Ruin all to be content. Kill them to make a buck.  You're more concerned about your breast size.  You're more concerned about getting laid.  You're more concerned about your job interview.  Guitar riff,  Cocaine sniff,  This world has more problems than Marilyn Manson.  This world has more problems than crime.  Open your eyes.  Open your god damned eyes.  God, however, did not damn this earth. Open your eyes, and look at that fucking child's dead body.
