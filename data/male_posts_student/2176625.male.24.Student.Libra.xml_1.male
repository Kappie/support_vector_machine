I know that we do, it's just hard to concentrate on everything we have to be thankful for at this moment in time.  April and I didn't go out last night. I feel horrible for canceling since I was the one who asked. I will make it up before I leave. It was not the right day yesterday after working out funeral details. I'm taking care of most of it since Vy-mom is feeling overwhelmed.
