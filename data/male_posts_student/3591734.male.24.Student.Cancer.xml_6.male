One month of sitting around doing absolutely nothing... didn't quite turn out as I had planned. By the time the last week came around, I was completing Stephen King's 'The Shining' and I could feel the last vestiges of my sanity gradually slipping away, in time with the mental decline of Jack/John Torrance in the book...   And if that weren't bad enough, someone failed to inform me that it was "Let's Fuck With Ryan's Head Week." Roussel and Evans started the festivities by informing me over MSN that Evans had met a chick on the bus, who worked at Poppa Jacks. It started to sound mildly plausible until... lemme see... if I can remember correctly, she's a hot rock chick travelling on a public bus, is of half Icelandic-half Turkish origin, has a lesbian mother and step-mother, works in a heavy metal bar, was wearing an APC t-shirt and is also bi-sexual. That's not a real girl... that's a cream dream. Emphasis on dream...   Headed over to Anupam and Nandita's place later on. Apparently, she had some great news to tell me. And the great news was... that she's pregnant. Now, this wonderful piece of news would have worked if it weren't for a few small details. Like how she's so sucky at acting. And how while talking to Sarina, she totally failed to elaborate more on this. And how she supposedly found out about a week back, but still waited until I came over to actually tell me about it. And Anupam being all calm about it.  Ha. Ha. You really got me with that one.  Anyways, the real good news was that she got a new job at ASB Bank. By which time, I had wasted my initial enthusiasm at the pregnant news. Joke's on you...   And so, there are four people going about their daily routines, with the mistaken notion that they've managed to pull the wool over my eyes. I think I'll let it be that way, cause I know what it's like to have the bubble burst...
