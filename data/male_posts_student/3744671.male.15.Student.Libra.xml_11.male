At first, I was skeptical about watching this, because it was before my time and moybe the humour in it wouldn't appeal to me, in which case I would've wasted two hours of my precious life. Turns out I was wrong, and I'm glad I watched it. I thought it was really funny.   The whole plot of the movie is that this lowly country invades America, but all along have the intention of surrendering so that other countries would give them money and such to help "rebuild" there country after the war in which they "lost." When they get to America, they land in New York and everyone is underground so they kidnap a scientist and his assistant who are working on a bomb capable of blowing up...a lot! Anyhow then the story evolves and they have to disarm the bomb because it's unstable, etc.   Just an all in all good comedy.     Rating:  3/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
