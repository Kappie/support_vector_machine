On saturday the day after me and christian got into this whole drama with each other we went to my friend Ruths house and were making up ... aww it wasn't the best situation on friday with what happened .. poor baby .. I knew he was gonna act like that Im sorry and I was pissed off , when I get pissed off my heart stops and I can care less of what happens to whom ever hurt me for at least an hour to 3 days, but with him it only lasted about an hour and then our buddy Tia went to his house to calm him down and she said she'd call me later .. and after that I started to get worried. I was soo scared of what would happen .. I thought he had done something to himself, he told me he could have killed himself for it, and im like aww no .. and yeah in the end I felt really bad but he said he deserves it and no he does not deserve being hurt .. not by me cuz he hasn't hurt me, he can never hurt me to the point where I would end up hurting him very much. But on that day we spent most of the time together as soon as he got their a sudden glow came to my face *like always* and I gave him a hug and a kiss .. ( I love his lips by the way) and yeah .. then after a couple of events .. we did some stuff that is none of your beese wax, but it was very special to me and hopefully him. Afterwards we went outside with my friend Ruth and the both of us to get wet hehe how cute hes all cold lol and me and ruth were like all confy in the cold as water hes all shivering I was trying to hug him to warm him up but it just made it worse but I still wanted to hug him, and then I got him a towel cuz he was like im cold and yeah then he dried off and me and ruth were still getting wet for a lil then we went to go get dressed .. * He had a nice body and it belongs to me .. YAY!! hehe * and yeah but its not like I haven't seen him naked before but yeah hes very sweet to me. Then we went to change we changed and I think afterwards we went inside and they were watching TV .. he was tired so I asked him to go to sleep .. I was scratching his head and trying to make him to go sleep but he didnt want to (butt monkey!) and then yeah shoot I got tired and I was starting to go to sleep aww he scratched my head and gave me a kiss while I was going to sleep .. TE AMO CABRON!! MUAH hehe and yeah I feel asleep for like a little bit. and then we did some other stuff with my friend ruth and we ordered pizza and ate and then we went outside to use the Flags, Riffle, and Sabre for Winterguard and just play around with him and yeppers. then I called my dad and he came to pick me up .. he was all drunk lol he looked funny and you can tell he was drunk LMAO.      On sunday (todaY) we went to Ventura in the bus to take Ruths cat to the vetrenarian so she can get her shots (the cat) and yeppers .. the bus ride there was fun I got to listen to christians Yeah Yeah Yeah's CD .. I liked most of the songs especially maps cuz it reminds me of him a lot. Then we got off the bus and we went to Petco and looked around for like an hour cuz her appointment for the shots were at 2 i believe. and yeah then we looked at some snakes and lizards and stuff it was fun, I saw this rubber ducky there that was nice and I wanted it ... hehe we tried to steal it but I didnt want to steal so I just left it there he said he would buy it for me but no I dont want to depend on him to buy me whatever I want cuz then what kind of a relationship that would be with me always asking him for money and him not getting nothign in return .. no thanks .. I would ask him for money here and there but like a dollar or 5 and I would pay him back. And yeah .. then later on WE went to eat at McDonalds and I ate i think a little too much and later on my stomach started hurting like a biotch and I felt like I had to go to the rest room really badly and im like OMG IM NOT GONNA MAKE IT ... hes like all trying to find a bathroom im like in pain shoot i was holding on for dear life LMAO (now I can laugh at it) and then yeah we went to ross' bathrooms and I thought I needed to go do #2 (sainly) and well the toilet was clogged and stuff was floating * it was not a pretty sight* so im like oh hell no i just went to pee and I felt better afterwards and I thought it was over so we went to go look around some more and yeah then we were gonna go home and my stomach started hurting again so im like shit .. and then I got to this other bathroom thats more sanitary and I just sat there until something happened and afterwards I felt soo much better but before all this we went to target and christian helped me in paying for this "Pilates" dvd (thank you sweetie I'll pay you back ok) and yeah cuz i want to loose weight .. him and ruth dont think im fat .. chubby maybe but not fat .. but im like eh .. if i have man boobs then im fat so yeah .. I want to loose weight so I can be more confortable in my own body I am confortable but not completely and hes the only one I've let look at me nude with my body looking like this and he says it doesnt matter to him but it matters to me cuz sometimes I am emberrased to let him see me like this and if im not confortable I dunno what i'll do .. I dont want to become this anorexic bimbo so im just gonna eat some fruits and healty stuff and work out so I can start loosing weight so I can be very confortable in my own skin and so I can be more attractive for him and hopefully make people jelouse of him cuz I know I have people that are jelouse of me for having him and I'm glad they are cuz I'm very glad in having such a wounderful person like him in my life .. aww!!!!!!!!!! QUE PURDY!!!!! .. MUAH!!! .. and yeah afterwards we went back to my friend ruths house and started kissing him cuz I didnt kiss him like I usually did today so I wanted to and yeah .. it was nice IM SOO IN LOVE WITH HIS LIPS ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY!!! .. and yeah .. I hope he likes my lips lol. and yeppers. Then yeah tomorrow(today) we are planning on going to pick up some film I took to get developed and yeah I am going to use that for my collage and he can have some copies and yeppers .. I love him . im soo hopelessly devoted to him .. I'd to anything and everything for him and to have him with me forever .. I really do think we have a chance of being with each other forever and ever and I would be soo happy to have him with me forever, hes been my first in so many ways, My first real kiss, my first true love, my FIRST, The first person to see me nude, The first person I would die for, The first person whom I love everthing about , ETC
