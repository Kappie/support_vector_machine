The cinematography and all that pretentious stuff that only Video Production students and I care about was fantastic, and I look forward to owning this on DVD.  The cast was wonderful. The great thing about an international film is that I go in with no initial opinions of the cast, forcing me to use nothing but my own judgment to form opinions. The lead,  urlLink Daniel Br√ºhl , was an amazing actor, and most importantly an incredibly sexy one. As Toby will attest, I was most impessed by his prettiness. Also pretty was the romantic interest,  urlLink Chulpan Khamatova . The cast was solid, though I had to be offended by how ugly his sister and her boyfriend were. He has ears the size of East Germany. Individually.   Spoilers   My main problem with the movie is pure nitpicking. Alex's refusal to reveal the ruse to his mother before she died seemed purely selfish and only a way for him to escape admitting that he was a liar the whole time. His mother had the courage to tell them of her deceit earlier in life, and came clean with her lie, and all Alex could do was run off and continue the charade. The argument that her health was at stake became irrelavent, as it was revealed that her emotional attachment to the Party wasn't what it seemed. There was no reason for Alex to continue it, and so he just continued his lie. Of course, something the film didn't address was how it could be said Alex killed his mother. Her coma was caused by witnessing his political activism, something he never sees fit to tell his mother, or anyone for that matter. And so instead of taking the blame, he seems to use the West as a scapegoat for his mother's illness. He would rather continue his lie until his mother's death then come clean and admit he is a liar. This saddens me. Luckily, in comes Lara to inform her. Unfortunately for my conscience, the film leaves it very ambiguous how much was told to Christiane. It was enough for her to realize to some extent what her son had done though, and it really depresses me to think what it must have been like for her to face that before her death. The moral is, Alex and I don't clash morally.  Another of my issues is more of a fear than anything else really. While I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie is pro-communism, I do think that if someone wanted to see it that way, they could. And I don't like the idea of this movie being used as Middle College student propaganda, because frankly I don't think that's what this is. Rather than being a simple "Down with capitalism" film, I think it presents a far more complex and historical perspective of the fall of the Socialist Party. And there are certainly huge metaphors in this film too, for someone who wants to go there. (Don't think I haven't, I just don't know  how  pretentious I want to get here)  So, the movie is very good. I've been describing it as a very dark Amelie, and I don't think that's  only  because it's European. See it if you like German. See it if you're interested by the political setting. See it if you're into comedic dramas or dramatic comedies. And definately see it if you have hormones.
