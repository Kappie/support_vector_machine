I am very much a people person and can't stand much loneliness - my biggest disadvantage. I can't focus well, I can't study well, heck, the only things I can do are listening to music or stone around while recovering. Luckily, the pool was there. The lights were still on, but never mind. I managed to recover quite a lot...  After that I went back to my unit. I did my maths homework in my housemate's room. He has a fantastic sound system which costed him around RM4000 because he modified it. I think it's  7.1 Creative product. So I managed to do my homework there awash in music. Then I went to another housemate's room and watched him play Caesar 3.  I seem to have lost my zest for studying(not really zest, but at least will), which is NOT good, considering the results of my last test weren't exactly encouraging. I have to buck up! I promised my mum 3As and I will have them!
