And if they do read it then you have even more inspiration to be arrogant. What do I write about, anyway? Me. I write about me and my thoughts. Even when I write about other people, I'm writing words that will be attributed to me ... that's why I'm writing them. One, so they'll be read. Two, so people will know they were written by me. Writing is prideful by nature. Blogs especially. It's intellectual bragging, even if your thoughts aren't good ones. No,  especially  if your thoughts aren't good ones. It's funny how people rarely brag about what they have reason to brag about: we prefer to vainly compensate for our weaknesses. Writing is basically self-centered. It's all about the author's ideas, what he or she wants to communicate to the reader. Writing isn't so much about expression as being understood. There's a difference, I think. What good is expression if no one can identify with it? Writing is the extension of one lonely human mind to another, desperately trying to share thoughts and experiences with another soul. Because when you think about it, we're really locked in our own little worlds. Our only window to what we call reality is our senses. It's like looking at the neighbor's backyard through a hole in the fence. You can see parts of it, but you realize there's a lot more there, that just because you can't see all of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Another human mind is like the neighbor's house: you can get a general idea of what it appears to be, and you can make guesses as to what it's like inside. But you can never enter it so you'll always have to wonder. We have such a limited perspective on the world. I guess that's why writing is important - it's a window into that neighbor's house. It still doesn't allow you to see much, but it's better than nothing.
