Was on the mrt, then this guy's phone rang, some ah beng ringtone and i was damn irritated.. Still never mind, after answering his call, he played with his ringtones for like 15mins, i was really pissed.. Somemore he was acting cool, like as if its cool to play ringtones on mrt.. After that, blast his techno songs off his earphones, felt like going forward and give him a punch...    Today took another Em1 class, tinking their presentations will be damn formal.. They actually came out with Phua Chu Kang quotes and Singlish... Haha, quite funny presentations they had today.. Robin only came to know that i am good frens with Kendra today, and he told me tings about work that Kendra shouldnt know, guess he must be tinking "Damn i shouldnt had told him all those ting", lol   Okie, so if u read my prev posting about the lady whose heels got stuck, and the guy with the bloody bag, u will know wat am i toking about.. Today, a guy did someting gross walking in front of me just now, he actually farted, a loud one somemore.. And i tink he didnt know i was walking behind, but then again.. haha i walked quicklyand overtook him (dun wan to smell his fart lar),and i tink hefelt paiseh when he saw me overtake him.. Just why must ppl do all these tings in front of me, why?    My mum was back for the weekend from my sister's house, and had the dinner she cooked again, yes! She knew that im sick of eggs, so no more eggs over the weekend! YEA  Current Mood: Happy Current Music: TLC - I Need That
