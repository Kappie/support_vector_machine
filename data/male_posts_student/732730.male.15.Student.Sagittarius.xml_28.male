If you see me put something through wrong, open your dumbshit mouth, and say something (thus removing your dumbshit status). Sure, it might not be an inconveniece to you to go up to the service counter and scream "SCANNING POLICY" and get an item for free, it is for me because I get the supervisors on my back.  Yesterday: Public holiday! Wo0t!  Sunday: Work. 5 hours. Surrounded by dumbshit customers.  Saturday: Work. 5 hours. Surrounded by dumbshit customers.   Friday: Work, I think. Last exam (German speaking and listening). I think I did well in the listening, but in the speaking I royally fucked my word order, so I probably got a B at best. I had my English debate with Tanya. We got a B, which is damn good for jsut improvising! Go us. Adders and Tan, woO!  Thursday: More exams. Shit.   And um, that's it!  At work, there's a really, really hot guy -- Joseph. He works in fresh produce. And he's gay. I'm sure, because he just SCREAMS prettyboy. I was talking to Cameron (don't be shocked!), and he says he acts a bit gay at school too.   He's so hot! I'd hit it, anyway ;)  But, ah, he (like the remaining 100% of the world [except for Galen. And Bill]) are too good for me. How depressing!  Um, and that's it. I had some more to write, but I can't think about it. Oh yeah, on Saturday I'm going out bush for three weeks with the parental units. Can't wait! Except dad'll be a fucktard for the most part (as usual). Meh.
