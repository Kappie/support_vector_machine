There I was - a young movie fan totally prepped (Jiffy Pop popcorn and Coke ready to go!) for what SHOULD have been the coolest night of my life thus far!  ...But, alas, it was not meant to be.  From Innocent to Cynic in one fell swoop!  Oh sure...they tossed it a few bones.  Seems like they even had some sort of musical number with a few Stormtroopers thrown in or something.  But when "Star Wars" took home not ONE major Academy Award that night, my "Oscar Orneriness" began!  I mean...COME ON!  What was NOT to like about this stunning achievement in modern-day film?!?  "Star Wars" had it all...action, adventure, romance, intrigue, spirituality, awesome special effects, a fantastic musical score, etc., etc., etc.   I thought SURE it was a shoo-in for Best Picture, Best Director...some sort of BIG award.  But NOOOOOOOOOOO!  The best it could manage was to pick up a few 'scraps' thrown its way in the areas of technical achievement.  When my youthful hopes were crushed, I soon came to realize that the only films considered 'worthy' of Academy recognition were those that:  (a) were set in 18th or 19th century England, (b) were written or produced by Woody Allen - or any other accepted member of the Academy 'Intelligentsia", (c) starred Meryl Streep, (d) were the most serious type of DRAMA imaginable - usually involving someone suffering through a terminal illness, a terrible divorce, or a death in the family, or (e) featured some combination of the above!  It is with GREAT interest then that I try to put aside my long-held cynicism and look toward the upcoming Academy Awards night for 2004.  Is it possible that the Academy elite might actually consider "The Return Of The King" - one of the most powerful, thought-provoking, and thrilling films it has ever been my privilege to enjoy in the darkness of a completely 'Sold Out' theatre - for the Best Picture honors?    Only time will tell of course - but it appears that many of those 'in the know' think that it might actually happen!  Whodathunkit?  - A film that actually 'speaks to the masses' winning a Best Picture Oscar?!?  Maybe there IS still hope for the world of American Entertainment!  (Insert your own joke about the original "Star Wars" film being recently subtitled "A New Hope"!)
