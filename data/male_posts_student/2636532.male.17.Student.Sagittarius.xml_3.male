Do you know who really bug me? High school friends. When you’re in high school you have to endure 5 years of being thier friends. The only ways out are death and switching schools. Sometimes neither is an option. Sure most say they are your friends, but beneath that smile and sympathetic tone lies a bunch of lies!  I really should be more specific then I am being at the moment. Females suck. Yes the one gender as a whole. That’s why I chose a long time ago to have only male friends and confide in males and only certain females… like my mother… that is about it. Females are full of sympathy. Always ready to try and make you feel better. All they while getting as much gossip they can while you are in a vulnerable state. Not only that, they give you that reassuring smile while telling you they are your best friend and are only there to protect you from the harmful matters of the world. I should know, I am female. I’ve had the temptation to do such horrible things, but I have refrained because I know how it feels to be in the position of the one getting the sympathy. Almost all females have been on both ends, but still all females want to do is backstab each other to make themselves feel better. Example #1: My best friend, one of them at least (isn’t it funny that there should be more then one just in case something like this happens?), has always told me that I am just the best person. She told me that I would always be her best friend because we get along so well together. Somewhere along the way we had become best friends. I think it happened because she said it so much.  About 9 months into a relationship, I hear from my boyfriend that this best friend of mine had asked him out several times over a period of a month or two. All the while she was telling me that I am the best girlfriend and that my boyfriend and I look so good together. She was telling me that she hopes I always stay with him. Those words mean absolutely nothing now.  The worst thing about this situation is that I never got a chance to slap her for trying to steal my boyfriend. I did not even get the chance to confront her about what she did. She had had the nerve to beg my boyfriend not to tell me about what happened. She made him promise her. He kept the promise for a while, but found it hard to keep it from me. He felt I needed to know so he told me everything. I was shocked when I found out and even more appalled that she had expected him not to mention these details to me. Yet of course she still is my friend. When I see her I smile and ask how she has been. Ask about the latest gossip and laugh along with her. I had promised my boyfriend that I would not confront her. She has stopped chasing him and I do not feel like having enemies. My revenge is the knowledge I have him and she doesn’t. I also figure that people like her will get what they deserve and I am not the one who should dish out the vengeance on them, life will do as it pleases with their rotting souls. In high school friends and enemies are often the same. Enemies are the ones you call your friends, but ultimately despise and would rather see homeless sitting in a Dumpster bathing in their own filth. Yet throughout high school you have to bare them or risk becoming the outcast. In most cases the enemies that you label as friend, knows they are your enemy and that you will do nothing to them. They can feel the fact that you are too passive and do not want to cause a scene, so you will keep quite and not disturb them as they try to make your life miserable.  This brings me to example #2. She was a friend. One of those people that are more then just acquaintances, but less then hang out with after school kind of friend. She was until she found out that my boyfriend was moving. Then she started saying that she is his best friend and that I am holding him back. She calls me names to my face and says things to everyone else. Some people she has convinced or just they have nothing better to do then try and impress her so they join in with the haggling. Most other people have chosen to ignore her ranting and to label her as insane, as I have. Still she persists in breaking my boyfriend and me up. She gropes him every chance she gets and never stops calling me a slut. She has tried endlessly to make him break up with me because she feels I have whipped him and he does not like being with me. She has gone out of her way trying to make me hate her and to make me feel bad for not letting him sleep around like she says normal boys do. The list can go on forever but I do not wish to bore you with the details of her harassment.   Yet I remain passive. I stand up for myself just enough so she knows I am alive and still with him. She still is my boyfriend’s friend so he endures her nagging, but stands up for the one he loves. She treats me like shit, but I say nothing because she doesn’t do it to anyone else and other people that are my friends still hang out with her and consider her a good friend. I have 2 years left of high school and I have come to the point where I don’t care about the people that I attend classes with, best friend or not. None of them have even done anything for me and don’t seem to care about anything else besides having fun and putting other people down which are often the same thing. My boyfriend moved just over a week ago, so my refuge is gone. I really don’t have someone I can bitch to in classes about the people that are just out there to hurt. There are a few who still bug me about having a long distance relationship and still persist, saying that I am too young and I need to let him do think with his dick.  There are 2 years left. After I will be free of these people and all I have to do sit and have fun with the people I could care less about. Then I will go into the world and will most likely find slightly older versions of the people I have mentioned. In conclusion, people suck.      -  Dark Lily  0>--}----
