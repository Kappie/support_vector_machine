It goes by so fast it's a marvel to behold. They essentially take a 4 month course and compress it into  6 weeks ! Here's a sample of my calendar. Keep in mind that this is only for  2  courses:  May 26 - Project #1 May 27 - Lab Midterm Exam May 31 - Midterm Exam May 31 - Midterm Exam June 02 - Abstract for Oral Presentation June 07 - Oral Presentation June 09 - Project #2 June 15 - Lab Final Exam June 18 - Final Exam June 18 - Final Exam  Whew...that's tiring just to type out! I'm then free for  16 whole days  before the next semester fires up. So, if over the course of the next few weeks I don't return your calls or show up to your birthday, or whatever, know that it's probably because it's occurring before, during, or after one of the dates listed above.   Currently: Envisioning astonishing academic success at great personal/social sacrifice...
