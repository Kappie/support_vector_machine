Beside the fact that I have no clue what's going on when it comes to the rules, I like hockey. Anyway, the weekend is almost over and I just remembered I have a crapload of homework. U.S. history outline (which I won't do), read pages in a novel (which I won't do), study for religion quiz (which I won't do), and study for chem test (I have to study for chem since I suck in that class). So actually I don't have alot of homework after all. And since I have to go to Scranton to help my grandmother move, I guess I won't be studying after all. Heh I don't see how homework is all that bad. Christmas is coming very soon. I would of said Thanksgiving is coming soon, but who really cares about Thanksgiving. Beside eating alot, there isn't much to look forward to at Thanksgiving. At least at Christmas you get to eat alot and you get presents. I think I've found what I want for Christmas. I would show a picture but I'm horrible at HTML so I guess you won't be seeing it. Ha Ha it will remain my mystery until Christmas. Well, I don't think I'll be getting a car for Christmas so there goes that. I think I've been writing this entry for way too long so it will end now. End post. Listen to H.I.M.
