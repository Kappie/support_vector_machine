I'm a haunted heathen, I'm hung and barely breathing The drowning ocean, snuff the sun in motion. Theres a pill on my tongue, a shot from a gun , the bottles bottom I'm lonely as a star   So heal me, I'm heart sick Hungry, thought I could survive on you Heal my heartsick hungry cries I'm heartsick   Father, free me. mama , woman, feed me. Child of fury, lost his way but don't worry. I won't stop til the dawn, Though I'm in too long on the run I grow strong and restless as a storm.   So heal me, I'm heart sick Hungry, thought I could survive on you Heal my heartsick hungry cries I'm heartsick    *guitar solo*    Heal me I'm heart sick I'm hungry and I'm broken I'm haunted, and weeping The blood of heaven flowing like a river tonight Tears I can't fight on my own        Fun while it lasted Emma... So much I want to say, so very much I can't... maybe I will write later... all I've got in my head is " a pill on my tongue, a shot from a gun , the bottles bottom" it could be worse, I'm sure... but this is worse enough... every fucking thing I wish wouldn't happen, and wish wasn't true, suddenly is, once again... all the veils lifted, the wounds opened... I see clearly now  Bye.
