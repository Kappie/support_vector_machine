I have plans with Phaedra on Friday. I am very much excited for that.  The other night, I went out with Bryce and Josh. Good times, I tell ya. It had been quite a while since I had seen Bryce, what with his school and with my work. It was a nice break though, to go out and drink. Like before.   God. I wish I had something of substance to say. I wish I had something to write that would change the world of make someone happy or cause those tingles in your face and up your spine. I wish. I spend most of my life  wishing  and  apologizing   ;lasjdf;oiajef;lk;h
