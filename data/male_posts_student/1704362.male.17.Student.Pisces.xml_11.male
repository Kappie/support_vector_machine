Okay, so this isn't a monumental leap into the future. I'm not making great strides for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. But I now have a way to spend the countless summer hours that, until now, were spent watching hundreds of Seinfeld reruns while gorging myself on Carnation Instant Breakfast(TM).  To the loyal fans and readers of this newborn blog (approximately 1, with a margin of error of 1): While i know that every fiber of your being yearns for more wholesome, chunky sentences of Jimmy goodness...   I must now go screw with all the settings until this blog is unusable, then return them to the default.  End transmission.
