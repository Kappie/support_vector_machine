After a month of hassle with Nebank (useless buggers), meaning full insurance coverage will shortly follow, meaning I can now drive my car anywhere I want. Life is all about these little freedoms. When you're restricted, life gets hard. Real hard. Something as simple as a bank hiring lazy, good-for-nothing morons, can screw up a whole month. No insurance, means your car is unsafe. Period. Park outside for just a minute...are you really gonna take that chance? No. But its not only this. Many things. Small thiings we take for granted. They all equal small freedoms. None of us want them taken away. Advice? No, I don't have any. Sorry. This is something we're all going to have to learn to deal with, for ourselves. Best of luck.
