Ok, back to the main topic..lol  As u guys know, im not working currently as there are no schools with vacancies for me to fit in, but anyway two more weeks and im studying at SIM, so wats important to me now is to study hard and get a weekend job to earn for my own keeps during my studies at SIM... My grandma was  OVER THE MOON  when i told her that i found a job last month.. But, being the money minded person she is, kept asking me why am i not working now, i had explained to her about the situation countless times, but she just kept going on and on about tis, after she had finished asking me, she asked my dad, my dad explained to her the situation again, and after that she asked my mum, and my mum explained to her AGAIN! Damn irritating sia, its like scratching a vinyl record on the turntable, replaying the same question over and over again! Seeing the chain here, (me -> dad -> mum -> who will she ask next? me lar!) Why cant she just get it? Does "not working = useless bum" true to her? Thank goodness my parents understand the situation that im in now, or else i might pick up a butcher knife from the kitchen and the rest is history.. lol  Who wants to stay at home and face her everyday? Endless nagging and questions, all my aunties and uncles cant stand her at all, oh well......  Not that i wan to say my grandma, its just that she practised favourtism in such an obvious manner.. To who? To those who are rich and those who can choose not to work but insisted on working... When my rich relatives visited us during CNY, her whole face and attitude changed... After my relatives had gone home, its endless nagging about how good being rich is.... But they are rich, so wat? My distant cousin wrapped an expensive Burberry scarf around her neck when she visited us, and she was so proud about wearing branded clothes, then her dad went on about how expensive her clothes are.. I was tinking, "Fuck lar, singapore weather so hot, wear scarf for fuck, somemore ur daughter so ugly, wear branded clothing also destroy them only, go and die lar." Cant stand rich people like that.....  Oh well, to me, its ok that my family is not rich, i've a caring family and nice friends, tats all i need to survive.. =) Tomolo is MtvFresh!! Can watch my Linda again!! Wahahaha!   Current Mood: Comforted   Current Music: Linda - I Miss You So (ya i miss u too linda, lol)
