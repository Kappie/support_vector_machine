So we first went to the bank to cash my check that my mom wrote me since she didn't have any cash while Dennis went and cashed his work check. So after we were done at the banks we were off to the mall... We got down in Indiana and decided to stop for some food at Steak  Shake, I ended up getting a Side-By-Side Vanilla and Chocolate shake with a mushroom swiss burger. It was a great breakfast! Then afterwards I put on Melissa's Tinkerbell necklace, it was soooo pretty! It has like these crystal wings on it soooooo pretty I tell you! So then we went to the mall and entered through the Marshall Field's entrance. We saw the escalators and rode them because they are really fun but when we got up to the second story the down escalator was broken so we rode the elevator down, not as much fun! So then we were off to Hot Topic of course, lucky us my and I think Melissa's favorite guy was working there, Nick! He is such a cutie and he is pretty funny too! So we were looking around and he came up to us asked if we were doing fine and such then when he was walking away he was aparently checking me out, Melissa said he was looking at my ass and doing a rubber neck at me, I was like OMG NO WAY! So then one of the girls that works there showed up, Melissa went up and started talking about how me and her both think Nick is really hot and all then she went up to him and talked to him for a bit while me and Melissa browsed some more. So then I find these earrings and rubber bracelets that I want so I go to check out and Nick is looking hot as usual and he asked how old we were and Melissa said we're Juniors and she said he had a disappointed look in his eyes so thats kinda cool I suppose. Then we were talking about DUHS and stuff, he said that our school is actually a nice school as far as looks go since he performed all the time in the SMC choir. He goes to WMU now though so that means I wont be able to see him perform or anything *sad face*. So then we went over to Spencer's and talked about how hot Nick was and all then we ended up leaving and going back to my place. So I introduced Melissa to my parents and then we looked for the cat but we couldn't find him for the life of us so then she left and I just sat around for the most part. Then my mom told me to get off the phone so she could call Centennial about a cell phone plan. So she calls them and finds out that they have a good deal going on and we headed into town to go get some phones. We ended up getting 3 Sony Ericsson T226's and 600 anytime minutes, free mobil to mobil, free nights and weekends, and free long distance to anywhere in the US along with all your nonsense like caller ID and such. So now my cell is super spiffy! You can call it anytime you want since Incoming is free and it's a local call for around here... The number is (269) 462-0425. Well I guess that I don't really feel like continuing the last night's post so I'm done hit me up if you want to!
