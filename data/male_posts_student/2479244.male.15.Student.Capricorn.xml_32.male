I rolled over on my back and stretched out my arms. My joints cracked and hissed at me for waking up. I had to make them understand its something you should do. So I pulled the covers back over my leg, the one that felt so awkward. It was very cold, I must have left it out all night like the cereal box downstairs. I propped myself up so I would be uncomfortable. I looked across the room at the VCR and it told me that the time was around eleven something. The last part was unclear. My eyes were still blurry from being in a dreamstate.  We all have such rapport with our body that we know not to press to hard when we're rubbing our eyes. They are a gentle thing, and they should be handled as such. After I could finally see, I moved the mouse on my computer. The screen stayed blank. I had forgotten to turn it on. I pressed the gray button, and I was flooded with thousands upon thousands of little pixels all guffawing at me because I don't have the latest hardware for my computer. I don't care.  Okay, I lied. I actually do.  So I look at my desktop. Everything on it is so tried that I don't even bother to read the title. I just look away from my screen. I went downstairs and I ate some food. Small prattle with my family ensued. I was still unamused. So I started thinking about yesterday. What the hell did I even do? Oh, that's right.  The day before had started exactly the same, but in between turning my computer on and going downstairs, I was interrupted by the presence of my mom. She informed me that we needed to take my dog to the vet, pay a visit to the grocery store, and chalk down some driving hours. I was up for it. I don't usually do much, so this was a little more eventful than my normal day. How fun.  I go downstairs to find my dog. She is laying down on a pillow, showcasing her new blue boot that covers her little bloody toenail. It is such a funny thing to see an animal in a bandage. They seem to want to make sure you are looking at it, and so they will put it right in front of you every time you see them. I reached down to pick up Jaci and she, as I said before, stuck out her little blue foot and gave me "the eye." I knew she was hurt. She knew I knew it too. So I picked her up and she didn't make a sound. I got the keys from my mom, and put the dog in with her. I went around to the other side.  After going to the vet and getting the little blue boot off, we took the dog home. She was happy and so was I. That hideous licking noise was finally out of the car. She is still a good dog. I guess you can't really stop the sun from shining, so you may as well let an injured dog lick itself.   I left one detail of the morning out. Earlier, I had told my mom that I was interested in purchasing one of those fan-dangled little MP3 players. The kind that play back my stolen music as I smile because I know I just kept my ten dollars out of some random man's pocket. Anyway, my mom said it would be okay as long as I paid for it. Of course I had to pay for it. Nothing is free. Well except for those little samples at stores and shops. We left again and headed out to Best Buy so I could fork over two hundred pieces of precious paper for a piece of plastic that blasted noise into my ear canals. It was little shiny black thing called a "Rio Nitrus" or something or another.   We left the place and went to the grocery store. My mom promised that we would not buy the typical 500 units of food, but of course, she did. And then some.  Fast forward about 45 minutes. We're going to the bank now. I'm getting out what money wasn't in my wallet to give to my mom to pay for the Nitrus. Turns out I forgot my PIN number (shows how much of a penny packer I am.) How great. Oh well, we'll figure it out tomorrow and I'll come back.  So I get home, sit down for about 30 minutes, and then I get a call from Stephen. He wants to know if I would like to go to the mall with him and some friends. Well, I just spent 200 dollars on the MP3 player, took my mom to the grocery store, and got the boot off my dog's foot. Usually a day like this is eventful enough for me, and I typically would have declined, but I guess I was feeling a little bored that day. I said sure.  So we met at the mall. It was ironic that those of us who came did not intend on spending money. We just came to come. Its such a simple idea. So we loitered for about one and a half to two hours. It was pretty fun. I mean, pretty fun considering the fact that I usually just sit at home and stare at this same computer screen.  So we left, I went to sleep, and then I started at the top of this page the next day.  I write this as if my day were really exciting, but in reality, I could have summed my day up in about 5 sentences, all of which were very bland and boring. But hey, I guess that in retrospective, this does make my day seem like it was very cool.  Very cool indeed.  P.S. - After heavy request, I have reinstalled the commenting system.
