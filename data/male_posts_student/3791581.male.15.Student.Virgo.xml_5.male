Yes, we know procrastination runs on our side of the family :) Right Ronald?  As I recall during our famous late night "Table" discussion, we reminisced about the wonderful world of Hand-Me-Downs! I felt the need to share some of my findings with my dearest and eldest (or even youngest) Hand-Me-Down providers. Hee Hee! Enjoy!   Miss you all!
