So this week has been really busy (i know!) and my sis got sick with some kind of virus so i've been taking care of her and hanging out with her so she doesnt choke on her own "soup" as she likes to call it.  Hopefulley i wont become one of the infected (oooooo creeepy) and stay moderatly healthy.  I think im ok so thats all good.       Last night was the season finale of  the sopranos  and it was kinda sad.  So my Adriana is really dead and christopher is all like boohooo she says she loves me but couldnt take 5 years in prison for me booohooo! whatever, christopher is basically tony's dog.  And tony says that they are going to bury her and christopher can be there to do it, too.  Another thing is that Carmela has no clue about ade,which is sad, but the really sad thing is that Adriana can be shot and no one bothers looking for her, not even the feds (who basically sealed her fate) bothered thinking she was killed.  Whatabuncha crappers.        Drea de Matteo (adriana) is leaving  the sopranos  and is going to play Gina, the sister of Joey on Joey.  That show is going to reeeeeek.  That'll teach people that FRIENDS is dead, it has been for sometime now.  FRIENDS ended when everybody started sleeping around, im surprised no one has any STD's.        Thats it for now, im going to go watch the second part of  the dead zone  and see what happens to johnny
