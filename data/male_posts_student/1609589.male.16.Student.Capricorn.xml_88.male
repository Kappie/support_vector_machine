So, without further adooooooo...  Just now, i was sitting here and i was listening to music, and without knowing it, i got really into it, what wif picking up drumsticks and making a commotion.  Then me mom came in and got scared i was gonna hit her.  I'm still slapping myself.  Allright, that was a stoopid story and i deserved to be punished for telling it. BUT! it was embarassing. So fuck you and your pretentions hipocrisy.
