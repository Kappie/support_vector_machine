Tonight I have decided to begin pre-production for the sequel trailer. Two or Three will be made, one being a Teaser Trailer and the other 2 Theatrical Trailers. This isn't coursework just something that I love doing and I hope that Kim will be on board again because her help as a vital crew member and her additions were brilliant and we worked brilliantly as a team, getting not far from full marks for the project :-D! Here's a short Synopsis of The Cross, and The Cross 2.          The Cross          Many years ago 4 vampires stopped Warlocks from releasing a Mystical power that would give 4 teenagers from different corners of the Earth super powers. The powers were trapped in a steel tomb and dropped into the Indian Ocean. In present day the powers have been opened and 4 crossbearers have received the powers, including Daniel Labson, a 15 year old boy who has just moved to a new town, which just so happens to be the town in which the 4 vampires live...          The Cross 2          After his defeat over the Unholy 4, Daniel has been able to focus on both his school work and his social life, vampires in Doncaster have become a rarity. But not only are vampires evil... A masked menace has been stalking The Cross Bearer. Daniel knows of his stalker but doesn't understand his intentions, until he harms one of his closest friends.          Those are very basic plots, and the 2nd isn't a definite yet. If myself and Kim start production the second we get back to school I think we'll have 2-3 weeks of filming and 1-2 months of editing. Hopefully the original cast will be back, and hopefully the outtakes will be just as good. I'll keep yas informed :D
