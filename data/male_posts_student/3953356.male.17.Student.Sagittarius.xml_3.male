You know the one... dreamy eyes... nice tight bum... and so on and so forth. (Those weren't my opinions btw... they are ones Lauren had... In my head!) But yes anyway Bignor should've one because I managed to deafen almost everyone surrounding me and Mr Blachford! He was gonna deck me!!! LOL!  I now feel sad because college is over for a while and I'll be stuck in Fontwell (FONTWELL FOR CAPITAL) and no one, apart from spontaeneuos Matt and Lesley, will visit me. Bastards.  Oh yeah, we went to see aplay last night called 'betrayal' with Samantha Janus and it... sucked big hairy donkey balls. Their voices were annoying, there wasn't any action and the jokes just were not funny!  But Samantha was F.I.N.E!   Any way   TTFN.
