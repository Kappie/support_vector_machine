Actually this was psuedo-inspired by Kelly Kel's a/s/l complaint which leads to my first point of order....  1)Don't ever, ever direct an a/s/l request at me!.....Usually I will respond with the following "witty retort":  22/yes please/Nashville....but from now on I am going to be HOSTILE!  2)Don't flood the screen with your sorry self advertisements....it is sad enough that you are even chatting in blackplanet....don't do the complete dignity suicide thing by constantly plugging your shitty page with one picture and begging for hits and notes so that you can get a lousy BlackPlanet t-shirt or coffee mug....if you join a college newspaper you can get that crap for free!  3)About these shitty webpages....this might be my biggest complaint!  Please, please, please don't put any music on your page!!....If you must put music on your page make it an option for the visitor to turn the crap off!  Nine times out of ten I have music already playing and your annoying music is not what I want to be listening to.  I personally hold "webmistris" responsible for this....90% of the village idiots on BlackPlanet have the latest Alicia Keys/Keke Wyatt/Faith Evans song courtesy of this idiot savant....if you are going to provide code for people don't half ass it!  4)If I flirt with your "online girlfriend" don't get irate with me.....see, I'm not going to fly all the way to East Buttfuck, California and try to steal your little girlfriend who is probably 300 pounds and lives in the basement of Granny's house.....I'm just having a little fun (more than likely at her or your expense)....I'm not trying to break up any happy cyber homes....
