The 9/11 commission is reporting....    Next week's much anticipated final report by a bipartisan commission on the origins of the 9/11 attacks will contain new evidence of contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran—just weeks after the Administration has come under fire for overstating its claims of contacts between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Iraq.   A senior U.S. official told TIME that the Commission has uncovered evidence suggesting that between eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers—that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers—passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001.   If we have strong evidence that Iran is aiding and sheltering Al Qaeda (and I should point out again that the paralyzed guy who turned himself in last week was in Tehran), then would you support a unilateral invasion of Iran followed by the establishment of a western style democracy?  Would you get behind Bush and support it in the face of UN resistance?
