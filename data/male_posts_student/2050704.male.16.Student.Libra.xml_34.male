Instructions: Write one statement to 20 (I'm gonna do 15... 'cause well, i'm just not that popular) people you know. Never tell which one is for who. Try to guess which ones are for you, but don't ever ask me because I won't tell you.  And now, in no particular order:  1. Pretty much my longest friendship. 12 years now? Now if only you didn't like foreign defensemen... 2. Collect phone calls are a entertainment source like no other. TITLEWARS!!! 3. My promise will be kept. The elephant will be yours at graduation next year. Too bad our "underground relationship" never fully caught on. 4. See you in the car. This game's great and i'll i've done is enter my name: Thrillhouse. 21 will ALWAYS be awesome. In more ways than one...  5. Yellow Wizard, Blue Jester and RED BARRELS. You play it where it f'ing lies! F you! 6. It's too bad we don't talk or see each other as much. Coldplay's still good. The guy with sparkle gel in his hair will never be.  7. Please don't comment on this post. Please. I've seen enough of the Wizard of (Insert random noun or adjective) to last me a lifetime. 8. I never understood your fascination with Gabe. Ever. Grade 7 conversations about Degrassi and the Trix rabbit are still remembered. 9. No, I don't hate you... but school sure was "interesting" at times. Just remember to use your indoor voice, and keep praying really hard (but don't hurt yourself) 10. C'est feminano. Blown out any candles on Bert and Ernie cakes lately? 11. Hey, that guy looked like Bradford How. Swatty McByeBye. Willie Augustine saw you lining up. 12. Elyte representin'... MSN freestyles will live on forever. As will 3 AM conversations. Ooh ooh yeah yeah.  13. New York's finest. I may not be a Florida go-er, but I still wish we talked more. 14. Your choice in hockey teams is suspet. Aside from that, your better than dirt. Well, not that fancy store-bought dirt... you can't compete with that. 15. "Didn't like the candy?" "It tasted like glass"
