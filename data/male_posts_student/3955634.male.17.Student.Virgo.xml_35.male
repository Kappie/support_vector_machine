Average Joe American scratches his chin, takes a sip of his Bud Light, and shrugs. "Sounds good to me! I hate taxes!"  Which is precisely how elections are won. Well, that and turning it around so as to say that the challenger is going to raise taxes for everybody, even if this is a blatant lie. As Adlai Stevenson so eloquently put it, "I have been thinking that I would make a proposition to my Republican friends... that if they will stop telling lies about the Democrats, we will stop telling the truth about them."  Of course, they didn't bite, and we had eight years of Eisenhower. By today's standards, that sounds pretty damn good..
