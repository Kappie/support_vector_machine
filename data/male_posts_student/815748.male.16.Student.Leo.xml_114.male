It's not that I'm a coward (though that doesn't help), heck, I've done it before, more than once.  But it's still either that I chicken out, or that it doesn't turn out the way I want it to.  I'm so close, it's so annoying.  Nothing much happened today, but the sentiments in the last post still apply if you're wondering.  Badminton with Dan Jung is so fun(g).  Oh, and my Myth/Folk Tale/Sci-Fi class is so annoying, everyone is really nerdy and the teacher doesn't know what she's talking about.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to suck it up.  -Edit- Stephanie says that it's the most hypocritical thing ever for me to complain about nerdy people.  I don't take back what I said because 1) these people really are like fantastically nerdier than I am, and 2) Stephanie thinks that anyone who forgot to trim their eyelashes to the exactly proper length is the nerdiest nerd who ever nerded.  And I'm going to get yelled at for saying that, so I'll pull a Loren and apologize, but not delete what I said because it needed to be said.  "Sorry."
