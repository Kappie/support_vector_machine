I'll put up the review of Face to Face in the concert section sometime soon. I think I should move everything over to my  bingweb  account.  It was at the  Face to Face  show that that I realized that this situation with (you-know-who) needs to be resolved. I found myself thinking about her, when I shouldn't have been... the concert was my time... my time for my own fun... to escape into liminality as Turner says about rituals. Instead it was time not well spent. I zoned out for a few songs. So I was weak this morning and gave in to my emotions and wrote to her, but I need to make a stand and really back off now. I realized I need to back off or else I'm going to end up hurting myself.   **
