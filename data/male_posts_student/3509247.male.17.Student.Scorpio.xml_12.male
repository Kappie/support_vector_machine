Anyways, cameras and light aside, (jk I'm just a goofy kid; don't mind me) I woke up early, although I don't know what for. I worked a little bit, but it wasn't anything I needed less sleep over. In any case I was given a few chores to do and baisically all day in which to do them. Being the initiative taking person that I am, I ate and then started cleaning my room (which had absolutely nothing to do with the chores I was given). Apparently my mom was going somewhere so after she left I burnt myself a cd that I could listen to while I work (good good stuff by the way) and then started to do the chores I was given. They only took a second, but then I had something else I needed to do. This something would earn me money thusly not making me quite so poor. I went over to my neighbors house and cut down her ferns. Thanks to that, I got 10 bucks, well 9 if I subtract the tithe that I pay which means I'm still a loooooong ways away from the $70 that I need by the first soccer practice. Anyways, after that I took a shower. Unbeknownced to me (I don't know if I spelled that right) I had mystery plans bubbling about this time. Well, after my shower I went over to my grandma's house because that's the place to be. I played some games with JDR before he had to go. Right as he was leaving, Seth came. We played until he had to leave, then I left because of these mystery plans. Well, the mystery involved an ex-teacher at our school. We (My mom and my two sisters) went to a park in Zionsville with them (Mrs. Borgman, and her three "delightful" children). In all actuality it was not anywhere near what I thought it was going to be like. I actually enjoyed my self quite a bit. Her oldest son is going into 7th grade and the other two are in 5th (Danielle) and 3rd (Whitney). Well I skated for a little bit with Brittany, Whitney, and Danielle then we went to play tennis. I found out I can't play well at all because you can't just hit the ball really hard. You have to have some kinda skills that I don't have, but I made it fun for me at least anyway. After our tennis match, we all went to the baseball diamond and played some "base ball" with tennis balls. The rules were different in this game so I use the term baseball kinda loosely. In any case Whitney didn't want to play outfield. She only wanted to be a batter so Danielle wouldn't let her. She threw a hissy fit and tattled on her brother who shifted the blame to it's true target. Well, Mrs. B. brought things to a close when she told us (all the kids) to let Whitney play. So, we let her play and that was that. She still never played outfield though. Anyway that was my night. Much to my enjoyment I took a nice hot bath after that. Ooooooooooooooh it felt soooooooo good. That's about it. Cept that CD really is kickin, y'know. I may put that together as a sellable cd and call it...... Shroom Studios Obscure Hits vol.1 How does that sound? Let me know. Anyways, this is me signing out.   D.J. Josh Rocks the house!!!   I took a quiz and I don't think it's entirely accureate, but below are the results. You're welcome to try it if you'd like. And the only reason I posted it on my blog is because it said Lord of the Rings. Ok, I'm really going to stop talking this time. Adios.    Lord of the Rings!     urlLink  What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
