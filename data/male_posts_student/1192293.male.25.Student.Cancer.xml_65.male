I might not be gay, but this is a victory for civil rights and equality under law, which is a victory for all of us.  To all gay couples marrying today or from here on out: congratulations and good luck.  It's hard work.  May I say, it's really, really, REALLY nice to have a victory for the good guys to talk about.  I know these have been some dark days lately, but keep on fighting the good fight people, keep your chin up.  Sometimes things really do work out.   urlLink Full Story
