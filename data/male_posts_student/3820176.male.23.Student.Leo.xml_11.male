Got a bunch of work done on the house, looks like I'm on track for moving into my new room by the end of the week.  Oh, and apparently there is Karma, go figure.  Oh, and if you're the kind of person that puts this in your profile:  Ever get the feeling you're about to make a boatload of money? Exactly.   ...Get over yourself. ;)
