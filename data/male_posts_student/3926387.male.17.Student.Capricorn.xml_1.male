I promised I'd do one last update before I leave, so I'm doin' it now since I have some time now, and tomorrow I most likely won't.  Anyways, Thursday was pretty boring like always, but I did see "I love the 90s" 1996 and 1997. =) I finally saw some stuff I remembered, and it was nice. So much has changed since then, it made me kinda sad since I was a kid ;_; and those days won't comeback. After that I came online for some chatter with mocchi and hannah, and left earlier than before. I think it was 11:30.   Then yesterday I woke up at 10:30 and took a shower, ate breakfast, and got ready to go to BOOK-OFF. I took the A and D trains to get there, since those leave me right there, less than a block away. Anyways, when I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to find tons of stuff by many many artists, and much of it was cheap!!! (The only bad thing was there was no affordable ELT stuff, and all the Namie itemsI already own x_x)I spent like an hour browsing and boughtsome stuff, none above $10 XD!!!!!!!!!!! Here's the list  Albums: Ayumi Hamasaki - $7 globe -8 YEARSMany Classic Moments $7 BoA - LISTEN TO MY HEART $7 Mai Kuraki - FAIRY TALE $10  Singles Ayumi Hamasaki - AUDIENCE $7 DREAMS COME TRUE - SNOW DANCE $3 Mika Nakashima - Helpless rain $3 Mika Nakashima - ONE SURVIVE $3 MISIA - sweetness $3  Needless to say, I was a very happy boy =). Afterwards I went to the Japanese grocery store, x_x they haven't restocked anything, it was kinda sad, in the drinks area they only have budweiser and bottled water. They used to have BOSS and Amino Calpis and lots of other drinks and the snacks were also unstocked x_x. I was able to get strawberry pocky tho, and I bought some good chocolate =). I also got 2 packs of soy rice crackers, which are GOOOOOD and cheap!!  I took the bus home, it was kinda depressing. You go from the extremely rich 5th avenue to the dump that is Washington Heights in less than an hour x_x. I listened to 3 singles on the way home, my favorite one was ONE SURVIVE, but the remix of "wasurenai hibi" makes the MISIA single worth buying by itself.  That was basically all that happened yesterday, I also got a good copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, it looks very good =).  This is my last update here in New York. So, as a final note, I'll say that the thing i'll miss most is NY itself. I mean, the noise, the smell, everything. For the last 10 years I've lived in NY, and I've enjoyed it a lot =). This is a great city, and I'll definetly move back here in 5 years. It's the greatest city in the world, you can find ANYTHING here, and the people are mostly friendly =). I LOVE YOU NEW YORK!! Don't ever change =). Anyways, baibai till Monday ^^.
