We are competing against 3/6 tomorrow! Best of luck to the basketball team!  Alright! Since I am in a cherry mood today, let me sing you a song:   a b c d  osmosis  h i j k  phagocytosis  q r s  thrombosis  w x  photosynthesis . Now I know my   Biology  , what comes next is   Chemistry  . a b c d  cation  h i j k  anion  q r s  covalent  wx  ionic . Now I know my   Chemistry  , what comes next is   Physics  . a b c d  excuse me  h i j k  tan chong hui  (dunnoe!! haven't made up yet...will update once the song is done)   Is it nice? I think so!!
