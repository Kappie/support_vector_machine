Now that I've played it until 5 in the morning, I know that it kicks serious monkey scrotum. Great sound effects, awesome cinematics, and mad crazy particle effects. (For you non gamers out there, particle effects are when stuff gets blown up. The better the particle effects, the cooler looking the explosion.) Red Mercury makes Rainbow Six 3 look like cow shit on a stick, with some dog barf mixed in. Red Mercury is really this good. The controls are super smooth,  almost  (but not quite) as smooth as in Halo. eek, I think this might be the kinda fps you can really kick some ass in. For some reason, this kinda game just clicks with me, and I don't suck at it. Rainbow Six 3 just doesn't feel smooth... And Grimes, don't worry about the heavy weapons. The heavy weapons class gunner gets an m249 that actually doesn't suck. It's powerfull and accurate, not like in RS3 where it has no power, and the bullets don't even get close to what your shooting at. For those of you who love shotguns (eek and I) there's a close range fighter class, who has a shotgun. The rifleman is pretty much a grunt, and the sniper is only good for long range. All weapons classes are equipped with their gun, a pistol, and about 5 grenades. People, if you've got a xbox, this game is definitely worth getting.
