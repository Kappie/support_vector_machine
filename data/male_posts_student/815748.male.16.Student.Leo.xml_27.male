Here's some funny stuff:  A direct quote from Loren: "I don't like going over to other people's houses. Like, in math class, Kevin was like, 'Do you want to come over?' and I was like, 'No.'"  It was very helpful in explaining the situation.  In Math, we did this logic packet.  Here's a directly-quoted example from an exercise: "The United States is not north of Mexico if and only if the moon is made of green cheese."  In Speech, the last line of somebody's presentation was, "The fate of the chimpanzees is the fate of us all," and Dan Waldinger said, "Wait, so we're going to be poached by a superior species?"  I have only one word to say: [laugh wholeheartedly].  Put THAT in your pipe and smoke it, Louis the German!
