Larry didn't have any friends because he smelled bad. Even invisable friends didn't last long for poor Larry. One day Larry was walking down the street, much to the distaste of the townspeople nearby when somethign amazing occured to him. In order not to smell bad Larry would learn to sew!  Needless to say, Larry was incorrect in his assumption. However, he did now posses a nack for sreating fancy embroyderments onto fine table cloths. He began to sell his items at market in hopes of making human contact, but alas, the only person willing to go ner his tent was an old woman wearing a gas mask.she was quite polite though, and Larry thought to himself, "If only I can be just like that old bag..."  So Larry went off to find a similar mask of his own. From town to town Larry traveled in search of this facial ornament. Eventually he came upon a store called GAS MASKS R U. It was a wonderful shop in the ghetto. All the locals can attest to the handiness of a supermarket where one can get his salads and ammunitions in one convienient setting. So Larry found the gas mask isle and found one he fetlt suited him and was soon back on the road. This time he was being chased by cops because he hadn't paid for the merchandice. Soon Larry became tired and came to a halt where he was promptly run over and then shot.  The moral of the story? Chris is a twisted individual... He needs help and lots of love.
