Well, what's done is done.  Lately...ok well, not just lately, but the past few months anyway, I have been feeling completely exhausted. I'm sick of just writing about it on here, so I'm actually doing something about it today. I'm going to write a resume. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, but recently it's been so much more than a job, it's almost been a lifestyle, and I can't handle that. I mean, I have no problem staying late once in a while, or working the odd 12 hour shift if need be, but not over and over again. When you have to start turning down invitations to go out with people just because you're too exhausted from work and all you can think about it going home and sleeping, then you know it's time for something to change.  Alexisonfire/Billy Talent. 3 more days. Can't wait. Can't fucking wait.  Also,  urlLink The Reason  is playing on October 10th with Midpoint, Belvedere, and a few other bands. Perhaps Crystal would come with me. It's in Cochrane, of all places. The reason is doing a cross Canada tour, and their only Albertan stop is Cochrane...makes me wonder...WHY? Meh. Less gas for me!  Well. I'm sure I'll be posting again later....
