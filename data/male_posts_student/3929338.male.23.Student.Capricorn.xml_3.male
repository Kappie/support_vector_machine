We know that she is an adult but she is still a friend we are very much worried about, she got dressed one morning and just disapeared. She was last believed to be in Columbus, Ohio and she answers to the name of Bekah.    If you see her please e-mail me at jmedic148@aol.com, and if you see her please tell her that her EMT friends Josh and Jennie miss her very dearly and wish her to come home as do the rest of her former co-workers.
