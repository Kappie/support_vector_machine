As of 10:47 am, the shard i played on has shut down and i have found a new one to play on. I am happy with the new shard i am playing on it is very satisfactory. The staff is nice, the skill gains are ok and much nicer enviroment, yesterday i started training my first guy, Hell i was up until 5:00am doing it hehe. I am making an archer mage so i can pvp (player vs player), it will be awesome once i get him set up, it is one of the most powerful templates in the game. Well of course before i go pvp i will have to get good armor and weapons, so that will take a few weeks, but it will be very worth it, i thought for awhile i was doomed but i am not at all, i found a new better shard so i am satisfied, the only thing i miss is my millions of gold hehe. Well my friends i must goto bed its 2:30am and i was up too late yesterday. Oh yeah i went to taco del mar today! Loved it so much, as i quote my msn name "their burritos are almost as good as having an orgasm", haha i love them so much will have to go there again. Talk to you later  Chris
