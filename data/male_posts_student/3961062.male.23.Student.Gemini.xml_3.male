Writing this brought back a flood of memories from the trip, which caused me to want to return even more!   Departure and Arrival. 7/2-3  I had never flown before this trip. Growing up, I was afraid to fly, but there was never a moment on the plane to Chicago that I was scared.However,I remember feeling a little weird after thebird took off because there was nothing solid connecting me to the earth.The views were spectacular.We arrived at O'Hare and had some time to kill after checking in with United, so we went to McD's to enjoy some American grease.    The plane to HK for our 15 hour non-stop flight was a 747. I had an aisle seat in coach with an empty seat between me and team member Erin, whileKevin was next to me across the aislewith Kathleen. I enjoyed taking off and experiencing the power of such a huge machine. The food on the flight washo ho mei (delicious),but after about 6-7 hours, I began to get a bit antsy.I passed the time in various fashions: playingPlanet Hollywood trivia (me, Megan and Erin were on a team againstKevin and Kathleen - we destroyed them easily), andplaying Phase 10 with Erin and Megan (Erin destroyed us easily). I also talked with Megan forquite sometime, andthen watched movies: Miracle (rocks! 7/10), Jersey Girl (pretty good 6/10) andThe Mexican (the last film shown on the flight; I was very tired and did not enjoy it 4/10). We arrived at the HK airport, got our bags, and met up with Greg Mosby(full time missionary in HK) and some university students that he disciples. Katie M. was also already there. We got a quick bite at McD's again, then walked to the bus that would take us to the camp at which wewould stay while in HK. On the bus I met universitystudentsDavid and Allan. The first thing I said to Allan was "How's it goin'?" Gregimmediately informed me that my quick, colloquial remarks would not fly; I must speak more slowly and use simple English. No problem.We talked about our majors (Allan's is building management), movies, and other things I don't recall.  The camp is not really a camp as in tents, fires, and s'mores, but more of a dormitory setting on top of a hill called High Rock,up which we had to trudge with our heavy bags in the stifling humidity. And I also had the fun of toting Ross' bag-o-bricks, since he was in Chicago scrambling to replace his lost passport. With the help of David and Allan,Kevin and Igot settled in our room, which was about 10' x 7' with two bunks. AC on high; didn't sleep much due to youths being rowdy outside for a good chunk of the night.    Tai Wai Church 7/4  On Independence Day (at least in the States),we walked down the rock and had breakfast at "Oscar Restaurant" - think Denny's, just dirtier. I actually ate a very tasty egg and ham sandwich that I bought at a bread shop across from Oscar. We then headed to Cheng Wing Gee College , where the Tai Wai Church holds services in an assembly hall.

Kevin then preached on2 Cor 5:11-21, with Pastor Stephen translating into Cantonese.It was agood sermon about why our team had come to China: to reconcile the lost to God. We then had lunch at the school with various Tai Wai church members, and I got my first taste of authentic Chinese food. It was pretty good! I remember eating a tastyomelet casserole and alsotrying a dragon's eye, which is a type of fruit similar to grapes - not bad, but one was enough for me. I enjoyed meeting various people active in the church, including Johnny, who I believe is involved in the music ministry.    Presentation 7/5  On Monday, we traveled to Chuk Sau Yuen Primary School to give our presentation. This involved the powerpoint show I made about the U.S., andteaching the kids (elementary age) simple English songs such as "Head, Shoulders, Knees  Toes", "Jesus Loves Me" and "Father Abraham". I stepped aside for that last one. We also performed a short skit, in which I played the victim in the Good Samaritan story. However, we updated it to take place in modern day Hong Kong along Victoria Harbor, since mentioning "Samaritans" and "Levites" would have undoubtedly resulted in blank stares from the students. Ross and Katie H. jumped me, Lori and Kathleen passed me by, and Erin was the Good Sam, all to Megan's translated narration. (By the way, Ross arrivedsafely on Sundaywith some funny stories about his passport debacle). Tip for those of you planning on doing something like this for young kids: don't have a male and female come within each other's personal space during the skit, as all of the kids started screaming and laughing when Erin helped me up! They thought we werein love...The presentation also featured some hilarious dancing by Kevin and Lori indog and chicken hats to such obnoxious tunes as "Who Let the Dogs Out?" and "The Chicken Dance Song" (I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but you know what I mean). Megan gave a quick testimony to round out the show.  urlLink Here's a picture of the students to whom we presented.   Now, I'm not sure if we had lunch with teachers at Cheng Weng Gee this day or not, but I'll mention itsince I've mentioned it. Many of the teachers at CWGC are overworked and frazzled, so we had lunch with them, encouraged themand sang worship songs. It was a good time, and while speaking with some of the them, I learned that they do not watch Chinese films as they are "poor quality". They mentioned liking  The Day After Tomorrow , and  I had to hold my tonguefrom sayingthat it's poor quality too.  Anyway, I slept better Monday night thanks to some sleeping pills of Katie M.'s   HK City Tour 7/6  Tuesday morning I had an opportunity fora quiet time of prayer and Bible reading. I went to the courtyard outside our room,and for 45 minutes preparedspiritually and tried torelax. We arrived at CWGC, ate breakfast, and then each American was assigned to a group offive to six Form-6Chinese students who would take them on a tour ofHong Kong. Form-6 six students are 17-18 years old.I greeted my group, and we boarded buses to take us to our first destination: a  urlLink Buddhist temple . My students showed me around the temple, explaining the fruit offerings in front of idols and why people went there to pray. (Most apparently pray for more money and better life-situations). Three of my students (Roy, Edwin, andRaymond) are Christians, so they do not believe that the activities at the temple are legitimate, and the other students claimed to have no beliefs.  Next, we traveled to a  urlLink Taoist temple , where three main religious practices took place. Many people  urlLink burned incense and prayed  in the center courtyard, while others circled around a fountainand attempted to touch the "holy" water in order to become righteous. There was a small booth near the entrance to the temple where patrons could purchase incense and other items to offer as sacrifices to idols. Also available at the booth were cups full of small wooden sticks with numbers on them. The idea is to shake the cup until a stick falls out, then take that stick to a fortune teller to receive some sort of prognostication.  The purpose of thistour was for the American visitors to interact with Chinese students of varying beliefs, and share the gospel with those who were not Christians. After visiting the Taoist temple, we boarded the bus and began traveling to Mong Kok (downtown HK) for lunch and shopping. On the way, I had a good conversation with Terry about why I believe in Christ even though I can't physically see him. Terry asked good questions and was very open to talking about spiritual things, and I was also able to share the gospel with him.Although Terry wasunwilling to believe,having this conversation made me feel that the trip was fruitful.  For the rest of the morning and afternoon, I spent time with the students shopping, talking, and having an excellent lunch of chicken curry and ricein a mall. I was especially touched when the students presented gifts to me: a set of marble chopsticks and some Chinese hand-exercise orbs(I'm not sure what thetechnical name of latter is). Around dinner time, we parted company with our students and decided to grab a bite to eat and head back to the camp. This day was especially good for me because my students were great guys, and because of my conversation with Terry. For good measure,  urlLink here's a picture I took on the tourof a street corner in downtown HK.   Presentation/small groups 7/7  Wednesday was one of our busiest ministry days. The main activity was a presentation to two sets of Form-4 (middle school)to Form-6 students, in whichwe again utilized the power point show and sang some songs. Next, each American got in a groupwith 6-8 students and conducted discussions in English about Chinese and American culture. This also provided opportunities for spiritual discussions, and I was pleased to share the gospel with both of my groups. At night, we met with asizeable group of university students, many of whom would travel with us to Zhongshan. We ate pizza, sang some songs, and had a Bible study. It was a good time, but when finished, I was ready to hit the hay! I've never been so tired in all my life; I started to fall asleep standing up!   The Peak 7/8  Thursday was a free day, and we took full advantage. We traveled to Hong Kong Island via ferry, which was a goodopportunity for some nice pictures of the  urlLink city . On the island, we took a perilous bus ride(very windy, narrow roads) on a double-deckerto Stanley Market and Beach. Some in our group, including me, wanted to go swimming, so while doing that, others shopped. It was very refreshing to take a cool dip in the midst of the Hong Kong heat. Next, we joined the rest of the group, spent some time shopping, then headed to the Peak for dinner and a  urlLink nice view of HK . After enjoying some pizza and aho ho mei crepewith ice cream,I went back up to the observation deck for some night shots. Unfortunately, most of mypicsare not suitable for public viewing (due to poor quality), but  urlLink here is one  that barelypasses muster. Finally, we took the train back to the camp, made a few preparations for our travel to Zhongshan, and went to bed.
