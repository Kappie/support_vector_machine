On the upside, I got something for my dad (on top of the camera bag and lense cleaners I just bought him) that he can use at work. All in all a fairly unproductive day. I've got far too much to do tomorrow, which kinda bites, but there may be some (Revenue Canada, piss off) C to the A to the S to the H in it for me.  Sweet mother of fuck - there's a Barney - Super DEE Duper - Dance Mat available. I thought they merchandised the fuck out of that Purple asspucker and sent him on his way. Good lord!!   I'm watching a movie with Michael Douglas as the president and Annette Benning as the wench he's well... wenching. Dude's a riot. A little Michael J Fox thrown in and hey you've got a flick.  There are a few things that I want for Christmas that I'm going to put on a list that I will carefully leave within reading distance of my rents. I'm looking to get me a terrycloth bathrobe and that slick electric razor that James uses in Die Another Day. I'm pretty sure that shit has a death laser built in as well, and that's why I want it.  Meh, I've got nothing more to say for now.
