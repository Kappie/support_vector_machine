So I get this call from my mechanic saying that "no, it's not the alternator, no it's not the belt, I'm gonna take it for a road test cause I can't find anything there right now."  Yeah. So when it conks out, it's just fate.  Note to Earnie Eves - you can make our drinking water as safe as you want - I just paid $300 fucking dollars for a power bill. You're not going to be re-elected stupid.  So last night's sleep sucked ass. Couldn't get a damn bit of rest, thinking constantly, about bills, work, rent, my car, my education, my future. Things are looking up, but it's just going to take a little time. Nothing like everyone around you breathing down your neck about problems you don't need to be constantly reminded of.  They figured out that the kid in the Washington sniper case shot some of the people. I'm gonna take a gamble and say headshots were dad, the more sloppy shots were kiddo. You know what these folks need? A little Larry Flynt action, someone to put a bullet in the base of their spine; they never walk again, but they get to live in agony for a long and unproductive time.  Hey, kids running up and down the stairs next door - speaking of humans that need a bullet to the spine. *want them dead*  So I'm going to get some leftovers and listen to CFRB.
