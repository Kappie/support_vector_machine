I cycled from Eunos to Serangoon Garden in 30 mins!!! Before I tried, I thought Serangoon Garden was damn far, but contrary to my expectations, it was only a stone's throw away.  On the way to Serangoon Garden, my friend and I passed by, from what I knew, her estate. I haven't got a pin point location of where she stays, only a vague layout. I was so bloody excited when I passed her estate. My friend suggested me to give her a SMS to indicate that I'm in the vincity and ask which block is she staying, which, of course, I did. I sent a message that says:" me n (Friend T) now at Hougang cycling... U stay wat block?", she replied that she was not at home. Then she replied again asking where are we now. When I received her 2nd message, I was on cloud nine. I was so happy, I almost got into an accident. I replied that we are on our way to (Friend C)'s house, then she stopped replying... It was already enough for me though. I never thought that she would even reply to my 1st message, yet miracles do happen...  Now, this may seem conflicting to what I've said in my previous post, but I believe that I have now at least a 2% chance!!! But hope still remains low for me. Like the incident that happened yesterday at foodcourt, God's message to me was so clear, yet now I choose not to believe in God's will. Will I get divine punishments? I hope I don't, but if I really do get one, I've got a request, punish ME ONLY... Without doubt, I'm still deep in love with her, one and only. I may consider becoming a monk if I am rejected.  One more advice, don't cycle while messaging. Message cycling kills.
