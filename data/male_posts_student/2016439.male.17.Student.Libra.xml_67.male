That was fun...sort of.  I don't know, I guess I just didn't take it as seriously this year as last.  I have a good feeling I'll make it again, but you never know, I suppose.  The only thing that's really elicited an emotional response from me was the drunk driving presentation on Friday.  Now, it wasn't so much the presentation itself as it was the jackasses (pardon my Danish) who were sitting behind me, commenting on how people who died in drunk driving accidents were "suckers" and who would cheer whenever beer bottles popped up on the screen.  I nearly lost it when they started calling one of the girls who had this amazing talent for art and who had been touched by a drunk driving loss a "fat bitch" and how "she should've died in a drunk driving accident."  Just goes to show you the quality of some of Midway's wonderful student body.  It was great today: I went to "drill" (it was actually helping out with the Vietnam Memorial Ceremony downtown) with the Young Marines today only to find out that one of the adult staff members could be facing charges of embezzelment, people are trying to break out of our unit to form another (which, in a small town like Waco, is next to impossible), and that we no longer have a place to drill at since the Marine Reserve Center has banned the Young Marines from their facilities.  Wow, a lot happened while I was gone.  I'm almost to the point where I don't care about any of the crap that goes on and has been going on for the last year or so with the adults anymore.  If I can just keep focused on the kids in the program, maybe we can get this garbage straightened out.  I'm having fun reading through all of the piano books I purchased last weekend.  Songs in my new repertoire include "The Prayer," a book called "Evening Reflections" (awesome book), "Come What May" (yes, from  Moulin Rouge ), an Alicia Keys book that I bought but quickly realized was a super-kiddie version of her amazing songs, Enya's "A Day Without Rain" (a book of the songs of that CD), and "Songs of the '90s" (it's been fun reminiscing, hehe).  Music is truly the outlet of the soul.  It's been fun writing and playing the last couple of days.  Just one more full week before finals, and then it's summertime!  All right!  I got my packet for the Leadership In Free Enterprise program at Baylor at the end of last week.  I actually think this program could turn out to be really cool; business leadership is really appealing to me.  We'll see how it works out, even if it is Baylor ;-)
