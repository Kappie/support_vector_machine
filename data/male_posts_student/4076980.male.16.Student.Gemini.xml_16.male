I prey'd to God that if in order for Kayla to grow in her walk with you if she needs me not to even be her friend for a lil while i will back off a while cause all i do is care bout her doin what she needs to do! and after that next night we started fightin and i told her that if she didn't want me as a friend then i guess ill have to deal wit it and the thing is i dont think i would ever had said that on purpose then we weren't friends ne more! but i was still pissed off! but then i thot bout it and remembered that i prayed that prayer to him! and i was alright with it! Kayla came up to me this morning askin me if i was mad at her and i said no and i told her what i jus told all of u! and she jus walked off i hope she believes me and guys this is serious God seriously did this on purpose probably for the best of both of us right now! we both need to be closer to him! and i swear u guys i prayed that prayer 2 nights ago and last night it happened! so if that doesn't tell u he moves in us besides the bible idk what does! me and josh r goin to CWBC tonite instead of our church hes comin by at about 5 to get me and be up there bout 5:30 so yeah ill post l8r how church went! LET GOD INTO ALL OF UR HEARTS! L8erz allz Brent
