This despite the fact that most polls indicate that far fewer than 12% were "persuadable".  True to form, the Republican crew was quick to point out that Kerry did not receive the large bounce that they predicted.  And, of course, the pundits were quick to echo this sentiment throughout the media.  The "Echo Chamber" at it's best.  However, the point of the convention was not necessarily to deliver a knock-out blow as did Clinton in '92 and '96, but to give the country their first taste of John Kerry the man.  Going into the convention, Kerry was badly losing the "nice guy" contest as well as several other key indicators, including who would best handle Iraq and the war on terror.   OK, OK.  Rather than go through my analysis, I'll point you all to two other sources that are quite detailed:   urlLink http://www.democracycorps.com/reports/index.html   urlLink http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVFb=134332   So, despite the negative comments by all the pundits, it appears as though the convention was much more positive than it is given credit for.  Kerry has made up some ground in several key areas.  ---  Analysis aside, there were several moments during the convention that stood out the most.  Yes, being in the Fleet Center during John Kerry's acceptance speech was a definite highlight.  But Johnk Kerry's leadership was most highlighted by speeches by Gen. Wesley Clark and former Senator Max Cleland as well as his swift boat crewmates.  Despite the constant claims to the contrary, Kerry described his main objectives and pointed everyone to his website for the more detailed descriptions.  All in all, I'd say Thursday culminated a week that demonstrated Johnk Kerry's commitment to his country.  I with the paid pundits paid a little more attention to the actual content of the convention instead of editorializing throughout every speech.  Other moments of note include watching John Edwards speech at a bar with a bunch of strangers and having a good time.  Barack Obama's speech definitely lived up to the hype I had given it.  He spoke with such eloquence and passion about the Democrats' desire for unity and moving forward.  His comments reiterated the positive message of opportunity and unity by Bill Clinton on the conventions opening night.   What wasn't on TV or anywhere else was a speech by Senator Joe Biden to the college Democrats, perhaps the best I've ever heard.  He called for mutual sacrifice and mutual benefits in a time of increased security risks.  His message of unity included the fact that "rich people are patriotic too" -- something that too many people on the left fail to recognize and appreciate.  There are plenty of wealthy liberals out there, reason to take a second look at the traditional class warfare that so many on the left try to fight.  Progress, in my opinion, will be more quickly realized when we work together instead of dividing ourselves on class lines.  The conservatives try to divide the country by race, religion, etc.  Progressives should not try to resort to similar strategies.  For me, the choice in November is now clear: unity, hope and opportunity or division, fear, and the status quo.  My vote is for the former.
