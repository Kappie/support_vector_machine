The other night when Chris and I were leaving the resort lobby, I spotted a turtle in the parking lot up against the curb. So, I immidiately thought to myself that there was a good chance of it either getting run over, lost, or dried out. So, I decided to save it. We walked to the water trap  (In pitch black)  and Chris located the water. I then set him in the water and then set him free. It felt great, especially cause I am an owner of a red-eared turtle, myself.
