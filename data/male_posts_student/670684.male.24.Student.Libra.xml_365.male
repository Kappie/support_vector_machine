It was 8.99, one of the pricey ones, but Pat was always a favorite, a sexy beast of a female rocker with pop and edge, and someone I fully regretted not seeing in concert for free when I lived in Dallas in 2000.    What I do remember is the drive to Fayetteville the week after graduation, taking US-71 and the DeQueen/Mena route, and coming up over the last hill before city splendor, and how I tried to time it perfectly so when I hit the crest of the hill, Pat's SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT would go from a capella echo to manufactured hard-side love song electric guitar.  There were 17 seconds between the start of the song and the accompaniment intro, so I had the time to hit back on the player to hit it perfectly.  I even slowed my approach for dramatic effect and sequence.  But no matter what I tried, I wasn't able to hit it, and Pat was well into wailing by the time free nature ended and Fayetteville (no more beautiful from any other angle) began.    I listened to the song half a dozen more times between there and Ben  Matt's duplex.  I even drove the block once just to finish the song before stopping  to meet up with my old friends.   Days earlier I had left Shreveport for the first time on an adventure to Austin Texas to find my fortune and my bohemian roots, to write and live the lavish life of the tortured yet brilliant artist.  And without any regality, without any manufactured consent, I arced over I-49 and descended onto the dreams and wonder of I-20 to Baltimora's TARZAN BOY, right at the first entrance of the chorus (whoa-wa-whoahhh-wa-whoa-wa-whoa-wa-whoa-waaa-whoa-ooh-aah), it's progressive drum beat and catchy melodies thrusting me from the cocoon of private school into a world of great opportunity, starting with a city I fell in love with the first time it welcomed me.  So it made sense that I could do the same thing with Pat in Fayetteville.  The plan was to hit Fayetteville, canoe with the old gang, and make my way up to New York City, where I'd spend a day or two with Centenary folks who were on module, lap up the world around me, and head back to Austin when I was damn well ready.  Fayetteville was the beginning of the trip, but almost the end of the journey...no longer would I come back as the student returning home for a break, only to go back to school later (though graduate school would put an * on all thoughts of "Real World").  Would've been nice to have a closer here.
