Anyway, you have been warned, as my blog title suggests.  In case you were wondering (which I'm sure you weren't), my title does come from a Van Halen album. They are my favorite band and I wanted the title to reflect both my interest in them and rock music in general.  Fair Warning  was the best choice, I think. It was either that or  For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge , which I found to be a little too dirty.  I'd like to start this blog by giving you an overview of myself. I am a 16-year-old male from West Virginia. My passions are my electric guitar and my car (which I don't own yet). I'm single...and always have been...and probably will be for some time. I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong: I am  NOT  gay. No chance in Hell. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm afraid of commitment, maybe I'm waiting for the perfect girl...probably a little of both. Anyway, I spend most of my time on the computer and playing my guitar. I hope to someday be in a rock band. I hope that day comes soon. I'm studying to become a doctor (if my band doesn't end up hitting the big time), and doing pretty well in school. Top of the class and 4.0 GPA, my entire life...and yes, I would like a medal.  I hope you enjoy my blog and I promise to make it as interesting as I possibly can. However, I am not making any promises. Thanks for your time. Talk to you soon.
