Enjoy...     00:00 - A new day begins and I'm asleep at home.    07:00 - I wake up, have a shower and get dressed. I go downstairs to get some breakfast and make my lunch while watching the news.    08:10 - Three friends come over to my house and I drive all of us to school. We listen to some music and chat amongst the rush hour traffic.    08:30 - I park up and we head off to our separate schools. I go to my form room where a few other people have arrived, and chat with them during registration.    09:10 - The first lesson begins - Geography - and there about ten of us there. The teacher doesn't turn up, so half of the class leave while the other half sit and chat for the remainder of the lesson, with myself choosing the latter option. Someone gives me an invite to their 18th birthday party in mid-October (invite #75 - they must have a big house!) which I didn't expect, but apprecite nonetheless.     10:10 - The first lesson ends and it's break-time. I go and chat with some friends who are doing other prefect duties.    10:35 - The second lesson, Maths, begins. It's as boring as usual, being the Pure Maths module at the moment. I spend a lot of the lesson just chatting and joking with friends and not paying much attention to Exponential Functions or whatever the hell we're doing. Who cares anyway? We'll just forget it over the next few weeks of holiday.    11:35 - Maths ends and I'm off to the (you guessed it) third lesson which is Geography, but with a different teacher, who is actually present. We spend about 20 minutes on beach formation, then watch a video which has a vaguely geographical theme. Everyone's relaxed and joking about, eager to finish school (tomorrow) and go off on holiday.    12:35 - It's lunch time, and I go off to the dining hall to eat with friends. We sit and chat for about 30 minutes, then I head off to talk to a couple of teachers, before meeting up again with some friends in a classroom. We sit and chat, and I get to see some photos from Saturday's party, which prove to be amusing.    13:35 - My fourth lesson, Computing, begins. There's no teacher, so we sit and browse the Web as usual. They've replaced all the crummy mice with nice, new, optical ones. They've been secured to the back of the computers with metal cable ties so people can't steal them, which made me laugh.    14:35 - It's the end of the school day for me, as I have no fifth lesson, so I head to the car park where I meet up with a couple of friends, who I drive home. We chat and listen to music as usual.    15:00 - I get home, open all the windows I can find, put on the fancy, portable air conditioning unit that my Mum bought for her home office, grab a drink and sit down at my PC to check DeviantArt, my email and Thunderbolt. Lots of spam in my inbox as per usual, and nothing of much interest. Great. I then start working on some geography preparation for tomorrow's field trip.    16:00 - I go around the house, taking photos and videos, then transfer them to my portable hard drive and then to my PC to test them for tomorrow. It all works, so I start to write up my blog.    16:39 - I've gone as far in this post as time will let me, so I go downstairs to play some  Pro Evolution Soccer 3 .    17:00 - After a single game of  PES3 , I head off out to the cinema to see  Fahrenheit 9/11  for the second time, this time with my parents. It proves just as good and it was useful to see it again.    20:10 - Got home, wrote this and then did a bit more preparation for tomorrow's georgraphy trip.    20:59 - Finished most of the preparation, went off for dinner.    21:25 - Finished dinner, came upstairs to watch  CSI: Miami , unpack some new clothes and do some work on Thunderbolt.    22:32 - After watching some  Big Brother  and chatting to some people on IM, I call it a night and go to bed. The end of another day!
