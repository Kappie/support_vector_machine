       
      i'm down to hang out tonight... i vote we do something active (active does not necessarily preclude alcohol, though, so don't worry, scott) like bowling, pool or something like that...  what do others think?  or we could find a place where we could play that game i was telling you about at brendan o'neill's - the one with the bumber cars and the hoops... i can't remember what it's called.
