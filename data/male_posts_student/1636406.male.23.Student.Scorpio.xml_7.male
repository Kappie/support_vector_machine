It was great, I really enjoyed it-- despite the fact a bunch of losers cackled at nearly everything shown on screen, including music, and a ski mask.   At one point during the movie I almost felt as if one of the characters was talking to me indirectly, it was kinda strange.  I can see that some people will have a hard time seeing the two halves as a whole, and I think that is an obstacle for this movie-- the one plus is that volume 1 was recently released, so my suggestion is: go rent or buy volume 1 before you see volume 2, you'll appreciate it more.  It was a great movie, I'd recommend it for sure-- I look forward to seeing it again in the future.   Thanks Quentin!
