Before I tell you the question, I must preface it with a few pieces of vital information (otherwise, you won't get the humor of the situation): First of all, I am a  Mormon . Second of all,  Mormons  no longer practice polygamy (we don't have more than one wife). Third of all, my wife's parents divorced and my father-in-law remarried, therefore, I have two mother-in-laws.    Mormons  came up in my short story class one day. It told everyone I was one. I told them we don't practice polygamy anymore. Then, on a separate day, I made mention of my two mother-in-laws. I didn't even think to explain it. This, apparently, confused my teacher.    She asked me to stay after class yesterday just so she could ask me a question. She asked me: "I'm going to ask you a question that might be inappropriate, so you don't have to answer it if you don't want to. What I would like to know is, how do you have two mother-in-laws?" Instantly, I knew what she was thinking. I explained to her about my wife's parents. She told me that she just wanted to make sure and that she was just being curious. My teacher knew I was devoted to my wife, but when I mentioned that I had two mother-in-laws, it threw her for a loop. This was a question that has been bothering her for over a month. We both had a good laugh.
