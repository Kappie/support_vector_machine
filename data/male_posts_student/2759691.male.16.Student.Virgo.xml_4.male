The unexpected endorsement comes after his political advisors told him that people who vote for Ralph Nader would help his chances of winning by taking votes away from John Kerry. "It's all about political strategy," said one Republican strategist. Surprisingly, reports suggest that Vice President Cheney was not informed before Bush made the comments. While the Republican National Committee refused to comment, some Republican leaders said they were "shocked" by Bush's comments. Ralph Nader has yet to comment.
