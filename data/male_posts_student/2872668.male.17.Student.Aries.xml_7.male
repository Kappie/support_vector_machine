Even Wudao is finding life boring despite a new crush (though his antics amuse me to no end), Khaiphang seemingly has some troubles with love, schoolwork, and even with a certain Patrick, Gabriel is descending into an abysmal state in his homework (due to Gunbound), Wilfred is apparently trying to catch up with his studies but undoubtedly feels the insurmountable pressure, Chee Keen is uncertain if he likes our class, Ruihong in a slightly nervous state (probably due to his studies), Jeremy with his adamant pride and still stickimg his tongue out when excited, Letian is still obsessed with volleyball (is he playing volleyball or is volleyball playing him?), Peifen looks doleful sometimes, probably just tired of seeing me, (a mutual feeling, i assure you) Wangyang and Gaoshan shows a new enthusiasm in their lives. ...  Me, I have just finished freezing my heart. It is so much easier to see how the people around me change while i am in complete still, like in a motion film... as though i were the eternal sky, watching centuries fleeting past and civilisation grow under my blue wings. It is time to put my acting skills in play, for everything that i do or say from now on would arise from a cold, still heart, which would be antisocial and unacceptable indeed. Therefore i still need to put up a front called 'Sebastian'. There is no emotion, just wintry indifference.There is no thought, only tacit judgement. My heart is silently abiding by my decision, seemingly saying something quietly in my ear. I can hear it now...the whispered words are,'I know what you feel.'...   I had to benumb my heart, that i learnt.   The sky worries, and grows solemn   whilst time, too, stops to mourn.       I congeal it completely, so shalt i stay sane   then I cry, 'wilt thy heart not blame?'   Out of the blue, i heard something faint.       The whisper to my ear did seem   Like echoed flow of silent stream,   Or shadow of forgotten dream,       The whisper trembling in motionless time:   'My fate with thine was intertwined,'   So spake it in my inner mind.       'No need for sighs and tears, nary a need to fret: Ay've served you well for 17 years, Ye may bide a wee longer yet!'       Hearing thus, i lie down comforted   and close my aweary eyes.   With my heart's compliance granted   I sleep whilst the sky laughs, and time flies.
