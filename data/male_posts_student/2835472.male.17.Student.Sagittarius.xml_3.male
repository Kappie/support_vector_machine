Afterwards we proceeded to practice and had to work out a whole bunch, as usual.  That was all in good fun, especially when we show up at practice covered in such a rediculous amount of mud.  Whew!  I shall soon have Deus Ex 2 for those of you who know of it.  Should be a decent game.  I'm sure it can't live up to it's predecessor though. w00t.  Deus Ex was awesome!  I heart Kate, again. (Sorry I had to do it)  Boy, what an emotional blog.  I love it.  See most of you back at school pretty soon.  I'm trying not to think of it at the moment! ; D
