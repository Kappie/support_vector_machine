Whether we are at work, at school,hanging out with our friends, or chatting online, we adjust our attitudes and behavior to fit the perception that we want others to have of our individual selves.   Think about this: Do you find yourself wanting to say something in class, but choose not to do so because you are afraid of what people might think? Maybe afraid that the professor teaching the class might not like youropinion and you are worried aboutyour grade? When the subject in class turns to race, sexuality, religion, abortion, etc., do you jump into the debate with both feet, or do you simply choose the middle ground so as not to upset the balance of the room? The truth is, many of us choose to sit on the sidelines and take in the conversation, then, after class, we get together out in the halls and discuss the fact that so-and-so is a moron and needs to stop monopolizing the discussions.   Without realizing what we have done, we have justsaddled ourselves to two similar, but different identities. The first being the attentive active listener, the person who sits there and nodshishead as if agreeing witheverything being said, andthe other being that of the hallway activist,speaking out against the other students for their ridiculous opinions.   I'll take a shot here and tell everyone that, when not in class,I use profanity like it's going out of style; in fact, I epitomize the term, "Cusses like a drunk Marine."That's who I am; however, I don't want people to see me asunprofessional, so I try not to cuss when I am at school. I want to be a good son, so I don't cuss in front of my mother. I want to be a good Christian, so I don't cuss before noon on Sunday. The truth is, there is no real limit to the number of identities that we wear as we go about the day-to-day activities of our lives. I am sure that you understand what I am talking about.   In our text, Kimball talked about mudders who would try to hide the fact that they were mudding at work. Why? Because the mud did not always fit in with their work identities. Everyone knows that employees who are attentive about their work do not goof off on the job. Howcan these guys be getting any work done if they are hanging out in these dressed up chat rooms sipping virtual margaritas with their pals in another state? Were they bad employees? Probably not, but their "good employee" identities did not want to get messed up with their "slacker" identities so they hid the fact that they were mudding.   In closing, I have to wear too many hats as it is, and I really don't have a lot of time for chat groups or Muds. For me, between full-time work, full-time school, and weekend dad living in a shoe-box, real life identity is fartoo difficult to manage without having to come up with the time to convincepeople that I look like Brad Pitt...only sexier!
