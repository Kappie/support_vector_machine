I do not know what to do to make it come back. I’m trying everything I can to have my feelings grow back, but I cannot.    She is amazing; she is my angel. I feel for her deeply, but yet, I cannot seem to express it anymore. Every time we speak, she annoys me. I know not why, but I don’t like it.    I want us to go back to how we used to be, before I started to feel this way. I do love her, I know it, but it is not as strong as it once was, and I fear I will lose her soon.
