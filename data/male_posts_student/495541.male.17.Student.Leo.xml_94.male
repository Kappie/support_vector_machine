A lot has changed but I think most of the changes were for the better.  Tomorrow I have basketball practice early in the morning.  I hope that goes well.  Once that is over I'm going to try to swing over to Best Buy and exchange my defective controller.  I think I might pick up Madden 2003 for Xbox while I'm at it.  I don't know though.  Maybe I won't.  I was thinking about saving my money in the bank.  I'm not sure exactly what I'm planning on doing with it but I was thinking about getting a laptop.  Perhaps a down payment on a new Jetta?  Who knows.  I just get the feeling like I shouldn't spend it right now.  Good night!
