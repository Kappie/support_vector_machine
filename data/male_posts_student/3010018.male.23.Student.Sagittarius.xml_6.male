Would it be enough for you that just one person thought you were unbelievably gorgeous? Or would it just be trite and meaningless? If many people thought you were attractive would that be better? Would you feel better about yourself?  How important is it that other people find you attractive? If there was only one, or there were a million, would it change you? Would you feel more beautiful if more people thought you were attractive?  I think it would be trite and meaningless, to have just one person think you were the most beautiful person in the world. We are too obsessed with ourselves, we dont feel good about ourselves unless everyone tells we are beautiful. We dont see the beauty in ourselves, we are blind to it, which is why we want people to tell us.  Would having one person look at you as the most beautiful person make you feel more attractive? Or would you feel more attractive if alot of people thought you were beautiful?  Would it be foolish to think that it would be enough for you to feel beautiful if you had a person who thought you were beautiful? Or would you desire for alot of other people to think you were beautiful? Would that make you feel more attractive?  Would it be enough for you that I thought you were beautiful??
