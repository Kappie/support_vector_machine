For instance in February I was really depressed about it being one year since my mom's death.  Or like how your father is treating your mother.  And things like my father getting remarried to Cecilia.  But I believe it is these type of experiences that shape a relationship.  I think that the two of us being together has helped both of us in ways that we don't realize.  But there have been rough times together like when we were at the fitness center and there have been good times like last Wednesday.  I think together that both of us combined can face any problem that comes our way.  So the one quote I will make is "Our relationship will last!"  I love you ever so much Rachel Trahan! -Bradley Steven Sigmund Levy-  P.S. Sorry my yearbook signature wasn't that long!
