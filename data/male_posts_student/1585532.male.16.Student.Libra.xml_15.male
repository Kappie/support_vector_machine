I hate them with all my heart, thank god I don't have to put up with them anymore.  And you all can burn in hell you little bastards. 2.  The Vice Principle.  He's a damn robot, and doesn't do worth sh*t for your problems.  He just recites a speech over and over and over again whenever you're in his office.  He can kiss my ass that SOB. 3.  Some of the teachers are just retards, they don't deserve to be teachers because their IQs are lower than the students they're teaching.  Again, repeat the above, kiss my ass you retard teachers. 4.  The school in general just sucks.  No two ways about it.  Now if you put all those together, you have Pathetica!  The worse highschool ever.  Now of course, there were a few people that might still go there that were my friends, you know who you are, you aren't a little bastard, you were cool.  As for everyone else, I hate you, you need to die.  Go burn in hell you bastards.  Well, my rant's over, ta.
