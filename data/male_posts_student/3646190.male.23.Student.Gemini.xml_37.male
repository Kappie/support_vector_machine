I recieved an email from a friend and political comrade that carried such weight, conviction, care, and passion that it touched a place in me that few things have. It touched a place where words are yet to be born and it is there where his words found a place to reside. In the shadow of his words, everything that I could say about life, politics, and the human struggle to survive seemed to fall short. I just wrote him back now...  ---------------------------------------  I am wondering if it would be ethical for me to post his email on my "journal blog"? I would obviously change the name and stuff.... What do other folks think?
