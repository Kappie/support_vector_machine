I decided to start recording my experiences here for memories's sake (my memory sucks) and to share experiences with anyone following the same path I'm on in life. To start I'll start with some basic info about myself:  My name is Jonci Aguillard, currently age 23. I live in Orlando, Florida attending Full Sail academy in their Game Design and Development course. My religion is Wicca following the eclectic path with influences from the Dianic traditions. I'm a hardcore gamer owning a PS2, a XBox, a Gamecube, and a Gameboy Advance. I'm really into japanese culture and I love manga and anime.   And feel free to check out my website at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/jaguillard/   It hasa collegeessay I wrote on prejudice against Wiccans. Also a RPG game I created with RPG Maker 2K. Its only a demo of something I plan to do one day, something ALOT better.   Okay that all I have for the moment. I can always write more later on. Plus it is 3am in the morning and I'm sleepy. Tomorrow I'll write out some of my experiences since moving here to Florida for college. Later!
