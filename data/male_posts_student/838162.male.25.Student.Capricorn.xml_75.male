Actually it’s  Nigel  who is the one on holiday since I technically don’t get any unless you count those self-declared couple of days I try to squeeze in between modules when they are not overlapping.  Anyway, I was starting out the week pretty much the usual, studying and reading mostly, when  Nigel  gets the wild idea for us to find a network game to play to past the(his) time. He had just burned himself out on  Unreal Tournament 2003  (again) and therefore had the idea to give  Rise of Nations  another go seeing as how it is about the only Real-Time Strategy game that we both can actually stand to play ( Warcraft 3  so being NOT the one). So we sat on down and proceed to get our a$$e$ served to us in what turned out to be a 5 course meal.  Next day we decided to recover from our defeat by spending a nice quiet afternoon fishing, which turned out quiet nice actually. It had been a long time since I can just take in the sounds and the breeze of the sea. I had forgotten how much I had loved being on the top deck of the cruise ship I was on almost 5 years ago. Truly made for some conducive studying.  Pity  Nigel  had the misfortune of losing his fishing weight and hook…again. He would like to claim that he lost it in an epic battle of wills and determination between teen and fish, alas it was a simple really ugly miscast that snapped the line. Perhaps lighter weighs are in order…  In kindness and, well…pity, I took him to  Australian Outback  restaurant for some aussie style food. Of course before I go any further, I must submit a declaration that “I do know it is hardly comparable to Real aussie food but it’s the closest I can find over here” before my friends who are Down Under declare me a heretic and nuke my mailbox. Hey guys? If you want me to sample the real good food you guys get sent me the ticket and I’m there ok? ;)  In any case I was craving for a huge steak dinner and  Nigel  as been bugging me about the beaded mushrooms that I keep telling him about. So we sat down to two 28 ounces sirloin steaks, one grilled to a medium rare and the other well done. Followed by a bowl of hot breaded mushrooms with spicy ranch sauce. It’s so rare to have a nice civilized meal with my younger sibling without the toilet jokes and insults. I guess the endless refills for our huge drink mugs helped keep him pacified. I do wish we had spoke on more serious stuff than just in-line hockey and school but I guess we can save that for the next time.      I also had an interesting outing with someone else on “holiday” during the week. Will talk about it soon once I get my head to it.
