Take care of my newphew who forever give me headache, he will run from the living room to the kitchen, and if you are trying to catch him, he will bite you.  He is really a super, hyper active 1year old plus kid.  He simply just cannot let people rest.  Need attention all the time!       My granny was another person who is giving headache to me, keep calling and calling, want to sit, stand, walk and she is just too weak to do it, keep calling everyone name, but no one care about her.  Just wish i can leave the house and go home.  haha.. but overall, must take care of her also.        Later will be going to esplande to see the firework, hope everything will be alright.  See yA!
