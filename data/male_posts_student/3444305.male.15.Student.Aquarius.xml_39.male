Me and my family went up to go get our passes and they made us go to the stupid Park District to get our stupid pictures taken, we have to carry I a picture ID to get into the pool these days. It's crazy, things aren't what they were the before. First the Gus Macker is coming here and now this! But that's the way it goes. After I got my pass my dad and brother drove up to the pool, and I decided I didn't want to go. But then, I decided to just go buy a candy bar. So I walked up there and talked to Candace for a little. And then I talked to Mary. Thanks for the candy bar Mary ;-) Then I walked home, and went to church. Then me and my family went over to Grand Pairie. I got two pairs of pants and Old Navy and two pairs of sweats that were only $3.97 each. And my pairs of pants were only $9.99 each. I got out with a deal in that store. Well I didn't, my parents did at least lol. Then we went to this new Mexican Grill over in Grand Prairie. Which was really good. Then we came home and I played basketball outside in the dark listening to music for about an hour. Then I just came inside and kinda just did nothing. It's just a blur of my last 2 hours. Don't know why. Oh well. Brian and Andrew just got home, which is cool. And on a sad note, Former President Ronald Reagan died today at the age of 93. He was my very first president, and he was only president for me, for about 5 hours. I was born on the day he left office, the day George Bush Sr. got sworn into to office. But President Regan was still my president for about 5 hours until the ignogoration took place for George Bush. So may Ronald Reagan rest in peace. God Bless and I'll pray for ya. Well back to my boring night. See-ya.
