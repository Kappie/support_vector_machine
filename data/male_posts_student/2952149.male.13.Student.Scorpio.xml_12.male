We played this game but all I really did was talk to Stacey, Thomas, and Mark. I am glad to see Stacey is feeling a bit better, I felt bad to see her so down. (Maybe I will still have a chance before the year is over!)lol....or not. Yesterday was a bad but fun at the same time experience. We went to the Mets game but in Kissimee. It was like 40 degrees and i was in shorts and a light sweatshirt. We were SO COLD. We left in the 5th inning. Then we went down to Auchwitz...shit i mean IHOP and are waitress was like Polish or sumthin and she was all like "Ello and velcom to IHEP." That was my couple days.
