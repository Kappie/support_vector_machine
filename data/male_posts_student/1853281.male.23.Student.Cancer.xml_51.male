Saturday i had to be in the library and sunday to do homework, but i had a good weekend. Monday and tuesday have been a blur of writing my late papers and trying to make sure they get in on time.  I did. Was walking through the skyway today when the rain was falling but starting to turn into snow and i overheard a buisiness type say "oh shit. It's visible rain. Where did you park." for some reason this really cracked me up. Who says visible rain? why not hail or ice or sleet or snow or any of the thousands of words we say here. Why visible rain? I don't know, but that cracked my shit up. Had lunch with my lesbian wife at pete's grill. Real cracker type minnesota food, beef with buttered noodles, bread pudding with vanilla sauce, and weak black coffee. That combined with the decor and the fact i could smoke made me feel as if i had been transported back to the 50's. The waitress looked like she had been there since the twenties. Seriously, i think she must be older than my dad.  Just over heard a offive mate saying what they liked to drink: a plastic mug half filled with vodka and half filled with diet mountain dew. That is frightening. so frightening. I seem to be surrounded by the burbs, pretty trashy burbs too. What do they eat with that? Squeeze Cheeze and twinkies? Fishsticks? Some sort of casserole with cream of mushroom soup and french fried onions? I don't know. Have to go cheers
