I replied "so what have I been saying then?"  So abruptly he told me it was to do with personal information to do with him from which I've denied to the fullest thing I can deny stuff. From previous fallouts that I've been through with this type of circumstance, and knowing this bloke for a fair time, I wouldn't blame him if he decided to despise the ground in which I walked on. I'll be the 1st to admit that, in the past, I've done some God awful sh-it things, which I'd hasten to add that anyone who reads this blog isn't aware of, and won't be in the foreseeable future. Still though Since I've gone to college, I've grown up immeasurably, and this isn't me being egotistical, I have been told by quite a few people, on quite a few occasions in the recent past. Also virtually no-one in Esher knows this guy who I'm talking about anyway (who will be referred to as erm hmmmm . . . Mr X), and the people who do I hate with a passion and don't talk to anyway. I have nothing to spread about Mr X anyway, so why would people be so callust and as cold as they are at the moment even just to spite me.   Anyway this hasn't been the best of start to the day, as I'm sure your well aware of, but the day is still young, and there's a lot of things to be cheerful about I guess. Meh so I'll tell you later about the day. xBuBzx
