It was raining but nobody gave a shit.  Well after no one was outside anymore, i decided to step out, cause it was hot, and I felt like standing in the rain to cool off and get away from the loud pop/rap/hip-hop for a moment.  I was standing by the screen door as I had intended to go back inside after just a short minute or so.  Then, some girl, whom I didn't even know, opens the screen and asks me if this is where all the people make out.  I said, I didn;t think so, me being the only one out there.  Then she asks "well you u like someone to make out with?"  I quickly replied with a polite "no thank you"  I still wonder about that though.  I mean, I still havent even made out with anyone, but should I have?  I dont know.  I want my first kiss to be special.. Thinking back, should I have taken the oppurtunity?  Are my ideas on romance outdated?  Well I'm only 14, but prolly 13 at the time, but yeah.  What do you think?  Comments?
