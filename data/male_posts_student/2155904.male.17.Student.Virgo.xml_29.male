After school Tyke decided to go to the Sly Lion boys bball game at Sly Lion.  He felt bad for not going to Friends night at Dottie's because he said he was going to but he likes basketball better and he didn't think that anybody was going to Friends.  But he still felt really bad.  The game was fun though and pretty intense for being between Sly Lion and "inner-city bellevue."  Unfortunately Sly Lion won but it was a fun game to go to.  Tyke just hung out with Purdy, Mandy, and Tig'Ol for the game and talked to Ekul's parents cuz he hasn't talked to them in FOREVER!!!  So it was a fun night.  But then after the game the Sly Lion boys were back with Tyke's friends so he decided that he didn't really feel like being a 5th wheel so he just went on home instead of hanging out with them.  But it's cool cuz he still had fun the rest of the night.  Well, that is really all that happened today but tomorrow there is an assembly!  Yippy Skippy!  I mean Toodles Tyke!
