We went over to her house and played some video games but them I decided I was bored with that, hah.. and we decided to rent a movie.  We got Changing Lanes.  It was pretty good.  I already saw it but I didn’t mind seeing it again.  It was a good movie.  We played some pool and I kicked but.  Then did some putting and I decided to become the next Tiger Woods.  I made like 3 long distance putts in a row so then I decided to go pro.  Bahahah.  Good one.  Yesterday had fun watching Whit’s team kick some ass at the volleyball tournament up at Kennedy.  That was pretty tight.  I was surprised at how fun volleyball is to watch.  So yeah her team won, and that was tight.  Then last night I watched Stealing Harvard.  That movie was pretty funny.  Tom Green is so funny.  I crack up at the line where he’s like “And that’s when we go in and we take the monnneeey!”  Bahah.. it must be just the way he says money in that line.  So yeah that was tight.  Today I really didn’t do anything.  Watched some tv and that’s about it.  Sundays are pretty boring.  Always sucks the day before going back to school.  So today was boring.  Night.
