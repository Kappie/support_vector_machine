We walked around for awhile, I got some magnets for my fridge, I met JB and Kasper from 98pxy and that was about it.  We came back to my place, watched TV, hung out and went to bed.  We woke up at 8 to get ready for the wedding.  We got going around 9:30, the wedding was at 11.  We got there with about 25 minutes to spare.  We found our way into this 'church', and I put quotes around it only because it was more like a community center than a church, and Cindy and I talked until the wedding started.  Colleen (the bride) gave me Audrey's (highschool friend) camera to take pictures.  When the wedding started, Colleen started coming down the aisle and she looked terrific.  However, the camera was VERY loud and started rewinding as I was taking a picture of the bride.  So I changed rolls and took as many pictures as possible of everyone involved.  The wedding was summed up like this:  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we come here today Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, to wed these two Jesus, Jesus, people Colleen and Anton Jesus, Jesus, repent repent may the Lord be with you Jesus, and its not too late for all you nonbelievers.  Amen.  Cindy and I got out of there and went to my mom's to drop off our stuff and kill some time before the reception at the Holiday Inn in Waterloo at 2.  But since we were in our nice clothes (Cindy looked fantastic), we couldn't do much.  We got down to the reception and waited around about 45 minutes for everyone to arrive.  My shirt matched the entire wedding completely, so I think I was mistaken for one of the people in the wedding party.  I was in a nice suit after all. I got a mixed drink (I had to tell her how to make it) and we ate so much cheese and crackers I felt I was going to explode.  But the main meal started (a buffet) and we ate with two lovely people that my mother actually knows.  So we talked to them about travel, California and our cross country trip Cindy and I are taking later this Summer.  The food was VERY good.  However, it was more salt that I'm used to.  But I liked it: rice, vegies, chick with breading and other fine things.  There was no dancing so we were bummed.  Nola and Molly were having issues with work and I needed to go home to take Nola to work.  So Cindy and I excused ourselves before we got cake, said goodbye to Colleen, Anton, Audrey and made our way outside.  We promptly went to McDonalds and got ice cream cones for a treat.  We got home and we changed and hung out while Nola and Mom got ready.  We were going to the casino that night and I offered to drive mom instead of her going with my aunts in their vehicle.  Cindy petted the horse (and I took some really nice pictures, but my PDA lost them when it ran out of battery power).  She hung out with the horse forever and it ended up licking/biting her knee.  But we went and dropped off Nola, got gas and headed for Verona (past Syracuse).  That takes about 75 minutes.  We got to the casino and made our way in.  I had to get a replacement gambling card, and I also forgot my free play :( .  But we found Deb and Mary Joan, gambled for a bit, then went to dinner at one of the restaurants.  It was really good.  We hung out, laughed, talked and ended up heading back to gamble while Mary Joan, my mother, and Frank went to the concert.  Cindy and I walked around for awhile while Deb gambled at the $1 machines (she ended up winning over $300) and I came out about $20 in the hole.  But Deb gave me $20 to go to the movies with Cindy, so we sped off to a neighboring area to watch a movie.  We got there (after I hit a curb) and found the movie was 30 minutes in.  So we went back home.  We got back, Cindy and Nola watched a movie (children of the corn I think) and I went to bed.  I woke up and it was 11:00.  Eeek, we were meeting Laura and Luke for Darien Lake (well, not meeting them, getting a free ticket from their book) today and they would have already left.  So I called, made arrangements to meet them at the gate when we got there and we got ready to leave.  We packed up the car (I still have stuff at my mom's I keep bringing up with me each trip) and we headed back to my place.  We got here around 1, unpacked, got something to eat, and left for Darien Lake.  We got there around 3, met Laura and Luke and explored the park until late.  We had a lot of fun, rode Superman 5 times.  Laura and Luke left around 9 (they had been there around 12 hours) and we rode a couple more rides.  I won two gigantic snakes for the weight guessing game.  They always underguess my weight, which is great.  We ended up leaving, dropping by Burger King for dinner, then got gas for $1.95 off the Exit 48 offramp for the thruway.  We got back, I dropped Cindy off, Nola and I fell asleep.  She fell asleep about 2 hours after me, but thats just details.  I got up Monday, went to work and worked on DARS stuff for the morning.  I felt ill, asked to go home and I did.  However, I had a LONG meeting at the Towne House at 1 so I couldn't relax until after that was over.  It looks like DARS will be done in just a couple weeks.  I laid down for the rest of the afternoon.  Cindy came over for dinner and Nola's boyfriend Alex came over as well.  So we went to Raging Burrito (such a good place to eat) and had dinner.  We then went to the movies.  I had a headache through the entire thing, but we enjoyed "Stepford Wives" a very funny movie.  We got there 15 minutes late, but STILL before the movie started.  That's what I call timing. :)  We came back to the apartment and relaxed and watched TV.  Nola and Alex went for a walk and I fell asleep.  I awoke this morning to my infamous sore throat.  I usually only get it when I go my mother's home and come back... which I did this weekend.  Ugh.  So now I can hardly breathe and I have a headache.  I called in sick and have been just relaxing, taking medicine and drinking fluids.  I'm going to get a strep test later today.  I made Nola breakfast, mom is picking her up in a couple minutes.
