Im kinda pissed off at myself for hurting her but there was no other way. It was either hurt her now or hurt her even worse later. I think I made the logical choice. I cant be involved in relationships. I get too scared and run away. Im too imature.... aw well. Thats all that happened in my life recently of any import.
