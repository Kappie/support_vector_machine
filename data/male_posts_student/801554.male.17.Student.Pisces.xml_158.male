That's not to say I could win a friendly wager of, say, five dollars on a game. Which is exactly what I didn't do. But it was a close game, that's all I'm saying. Other than that not much happening.  Oh. Except for the fact that I'm running for  Student Council President!   But more on that later. Yes indeed.  currently listening to: Coldplay, Don't Panic
