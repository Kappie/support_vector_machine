I guess Ashley the Girl thought of it, but you told me about it: therefore the ripoff credit goes to both of you. Anyway, the new motto in these parts is  truth in sarcasm . I should look that up in Latin. That'd be sweet.The other motto is  being tired is fun, as long as it's not morning.  Don't worry, though. You can rest assured that this is still the outlet of my insanity. It's just not explicitly called that anymore, even though the url is the same. It can be more of an endearing nickname for this blog.
