I was expecting to be outraged, offended, maddened, etc etc.  No one told me I'd be bored*.  The devices were so tired, the analysis worthy of something by an intern in the Nation online, the sad attempts to blame everything on Bush so strained and over-wrought even the most credulous of conspiracists would have a hard time giving them the time of day. (read  urlLink the rest )   If you're interested, I found a transcript of the  urlLink first half  of the "documentary". The second half should be posted later today or tomorrow.   * I added bold to emphasize what I thought was funny.
