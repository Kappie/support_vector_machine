My mom had to get her Dutch citizenship renewed, so now she has dual citizenship (American/Dutch).  Cool.  Derek and I will do the same, in case something happens and we need to skip country.  Friday was good, actually I moped a bit, but thats good.  Derek and I practiced a lot of gung fu(broke and fixed my glasses) and then I played a lot of Final Fantasy 3.  Everyone told me things will be better, I'll bleed but not die, things like that, too.  Thats nice.... I drove around in Mt Moriah cemetary with my parents and grand..aunt.  All of us relatives ate out, and that was fun, I talked a lot with Derek, nice.  Annnnnd then we watched 'Open Range'.  I likes me some Western movies.  'Specially ones where lots of people get shot.  Hahah.  Annd then what else I slept.  This morning I saw my cousin Lindsey, whom is getting tall.  And thats what Hallbergs do, they get tall.  All my relatives, tall.  She's 12 and plays basketball at her junior high, she even has a boyfriend (ah, a little young, but who am I to say?).   We left (Derek, Me, and my parents) and I did my algebra.  After we passed St. Joseph, daddy-o let me take the wheel on the interstate and I drove us home.  Hee haa I rule.  I'd say I'm a good driver.  So thats what happened. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Memories:  Laughing so hard your face hurts... A hot shower... A special glance... Getting mail.... Hearing your favorite song on the radio... Lying in bed for hours...smell of flowers...Hot towels out of the dryer... Walking out of your last final... Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price....a good conversation.....bubble tea....late night calls that lasts for hours....family and friends....hard times...happy times.....feeling lazy...having someone playing with your hair...getting a kiss on the nose....rubbing noses with a loved one...the wonderful feeling of christmas.....recieving a phone call from unexpected......hugs....smiles....   I remember those things...............   is 5 minutes of extreme happiness worth a lifetime of pain? I have known five minutes of happiness...I don't know how extreme it was...... but I want it to happen again.  I guess I am like tennis shoes, but in the sense that they are comfortable, offer protection, practical, not showy, comfortable in activity, but I do tend to chip a bit.  I have hope.  I have cried..... and now I am without..... is this forever?  No, it can't be, because I have hope.  I believe in you.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The past is a gaping hole....  the genius of the hole........... no matter how long you have been climbing out of it, you can be sent reeling back down in an instant.  -Payneism
