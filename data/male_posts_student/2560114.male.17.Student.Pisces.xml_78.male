All i did in the car was listen to my music and trying to ignore the yelling and argueing of my mom and my sister...girlz. Hhhanywayz, me and my dad jus basically did a good job ignoring the ladies bitchin in the car. hehe. i know u guyz like my sad/happy face pics, got the idea from my main man Setdi.
