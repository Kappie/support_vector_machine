At lunch I went home to pick up the test pressing that were delivered to the apartment office the day before.  It was so hot, 87, at least that is what the weather website says, looks like its gonna storm soon.    Well - this really wasn't public knowledge until I was for sure, I told a few friends, but it seems that everyone knows.  I am planning on moving to sacramento, ca in october.  It's is a good amount of time away - I get the feeling that some people have already marked me out as "moved."  I havn't yet, and now I really do have to move, job or not, I will look like an idiot if I have to stay.  I can't think of I would have to stay, or why my plans would change - but shit happens.  I hate computers more and more each day - the whole industry seems to me like such a waste of time.  It's always changing and you constantly have to learn new software and hardware, but it doesn't seem to me to truely be NEW knowledge or GROWTH.  Just another way of doing the same shit, making corperations richer.  Ever since I started into this, it was a job, I wanted to do something in music; but that dream has faded with discouragement.  I hope I find my footing soon.   I finished an awesome book last night - The Woman in the Dunes by Kobo Abe(1924-1993) The guy is awesome, dead, but awesome eitherway.  I bought his book - The Box Man - but have yet to start it.  I was still finishing up a book I have been reading by Henry Rollins, the same book that turned me on the Kobo Abe in the first place, when I bought The Box Man.   When I went to Midland over the weekend, I had forgot my book, so I went out to Barns and Nobles on Saturday afternoon and looked around for something to read for about an hour or so.  I found the Woman in the Dunes, and I also picked up a John Steinbeck book called The Log of the Sea of Cortez (I had heard some talk about it on NPR and it sounded interesting.) Anyways, the woman in the dunes is about an teacher/amature entomologist who travels to a beach looking for some new type of beetle, he ends traped in a hole by the locals and forced to shovel sand with this woman, protectors of the village.  Its a good book, you should  urlLink pick it up.   I need to go to school tonight, but I am not really looking forward to it very much.  Just another skill that will soon be out of date.   Knowledge that is out of date, what a fucking weird idea.
