Heb. 10:24  If there are poor among you, in one of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be selfish or greedy toward them. But give freely to them, and freely lend them whatever they need.  Deut. 15:7-8    You will find, as you look back upon your life, that the moments that stand out are the moments when you have done thing for others.

For whatever measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt to you in return.  Luke 6:38 NIV     from  Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul
