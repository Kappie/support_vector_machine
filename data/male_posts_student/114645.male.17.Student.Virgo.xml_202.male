If you haven’t seen it yet, you should. I LOVED it. I liked this one way more than the other two, maybe because it was funnier or something. I dunno. But it wasn’t as true to the book as the first two, but that is what you get with another director. Anywho, I give this movie  , which is what it deserves!
