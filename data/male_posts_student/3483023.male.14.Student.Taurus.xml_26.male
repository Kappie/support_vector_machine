I Didn't Do Much Yesterday, I Watched Alot Of Nascar Stuff, But Besides That I Didn't Do Much! Today I Watched The Actual Nascar Nextel Cup Race, Harvick Finished 8th, Not Where He Finished Last Year (Last Year He Won), But 8th Was A Great Finish Since His Car Was A Piece Of Crap! After The Race We Went To Wally World (Wal-Mart) And Spent Some Money! Didn't Really Get Anything Special, But We Did Manage To Spend Some Money! Tomorrow I Have A 'Youth Commission' Meeting  Enrollment, I'm Sure Both Of Those Events Will Be A Blast, NOT! Ok, Well I'm Done Talking/Griping/Ranting/Raving/Complaing- Talk To Ya Later!
