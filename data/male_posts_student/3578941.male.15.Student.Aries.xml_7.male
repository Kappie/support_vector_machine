There was a good thing about today, I got paid $5 for each present I wrapped for my uncle and I wraped 4 so he gave me $20 this afternoon.  O ya, IT IS HOT OUT AND I HAD TO MOW.  Well that is about it so read my next post and hopefully it is good or better than this one.  One last thing, I read Ashley T.'s away messege and it said that she and Jess C. were running around on the golf course in bikinis covered with whip cream! OMG they are soo fucking hot!   P.S. especially ashley
