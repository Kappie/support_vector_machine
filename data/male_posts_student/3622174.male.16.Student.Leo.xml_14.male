Hello, which comes from “Picasa,” is a third party software the Blogger users can use to upload pictures to their blog, and then, if they wish, they can edit all of the posts together into one big post.  (See today’s tip for how to do that).  You can also exchange pictures with your friends, too, which comes in handy for showing people who you really are.  Now, there are other ways that you can upload pictures to your blog, but none of them are as good and fast as Hello.  Getting there is easy, all you have to do is sign in, click on BloggerBot, start a convo with it, and then start sending pictures.  Write in captions and stuff, and then click publish, and you’re all set to go.  It’s quite easy.  Hello has got a nice interface, and, its one of the fastest messaging services I have ever seen.  The screenshot below shows me sending pictures to Hello this morning for my “New York Pictures” post on The Blog of the Bagel:   urlLink    Hello is the most awesome picture sending client available, and, its the best way to send pictures to your blog on Blogger.  urlLink     Quite easy, right?  That’s right.  Build a buddy list of people who you want to send pictures to.  There’s no limit to how many pictures you can upload, and it’s awesome to try.  So, get on Hello today, because from me, its worth a perfect score  5 out of 5.
