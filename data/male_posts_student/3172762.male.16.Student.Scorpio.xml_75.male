Within the bodies there are the elements, the material and the makeup  Within the subconcious there are the ethics, the things that make a man  Outside the universe is nothing; the abcence of thought, of being, and of life  To humans, outside the mind is nothing; it is not thought, therefore it can not be and is not life  So, to be thought is to be  To not be thought is not to be   ########################################################################################  life  like a grain of sand on this selestial beach is minute  it is insignificant in the whole  it's existance is dependant upon the static  the non-life  but when the life, like with a land slide on the beach, acts as one  the static is defeated  not yet in this world has the life won  for the static still wields power  not untill the life can act as one unit, as a dune of sand, can it win  still today different grains of sand roll different ways  different grains still try to overpower others  different grains are still greedy, proud, and ignorant  not untill all the grains work as one will we truly be free of the static  and then, and only then, will true life begin  ########################################################################################
