I think another thing i did wrong was when i was upset because she didn't call me so i could see wht her bf was like but yeah other than that i don't know. but the thing is she won't talk to me, so i don't know wht i did wrong.     well, another thing buggin me is my other friend is mad at me it was during spring break and it's like  LET IT GO!!!!  because her friend told her that the dude really does like her and she wantsme to apoligize for something i didn't do, and then when i apologized she wanted a reason why i was sorry. then when i gave her a reason she got mad and threw down the phone. but neway all of my friends know that i won't apologize for something i didn't do unless i had a good reason to and my reason was because i really don't wanna lose her as a friend, but yeah she doesn't understand that.   yeah well i'm single again and my ex-girlfriend told me today that she and my friend that is a girlare now going out but hey we're all still friends.
