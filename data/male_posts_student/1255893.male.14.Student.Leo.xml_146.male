I shall change NONE of what it originally said. :) -  PG 1  Aaron rocks. Jus had a short but meaningful convo on the phone w/him. Talkin is such therapy. We got to share a lot of stuff. We have so much sh@t in common. I shared ... we shared our girl troubles. I probably won't be able to share it with more than like 2 people and have it feel close to the same. I wanted to include Ave in that list.... I kind of felt obligated to. I guess cus we're sort of growin apart... we experiencing things away from each other. I should stop expecting that she's gonna be able to help me through a lot of things. In 8th grade it wouldntve been a problem because she was close by and we had more of the same experiences.   I was also talkin to kaitlyn as i talked to aaron. I realised she's nice to talk to. I'm afraid it's only  in small doses.nutes since the last  PG 2   sentence, I think there are two reasons for that. It would be ........ Just feel like i HAVE TO  stay not talking to her. After all I said and fought with her for, I made the decision to never talk to her and keep her out of my life as much as i could. How sad. I let my own expectation of myself keep me down. That led me to my 2nd reason.....ave. I'm jus afraid she's gonna despise me for it. I know what you think about her ave. I feel you're acting out of blind hurt and you're stuck in the rut i was in. Then again... kaitlyn is pretty closed-minded too. You guys hurt eachother way too much and your stubbornness will keep you guys from ever letting go of the hate you think you feel.   Ave is becoming such a part of my life. Seemingly unrelated things involve her after I   PG 3   disect those situations and thoughts. Just cus of the love I have for her I feel have to talk to her [online] But ive come to find that we don't have much fun often unless it's on the phone like we did earlier [today]. When i told myself i liked Angelica its like ..... she's really boring online. you know what? We hardly share any laughs or good talks at all. It's that feeling of obligation again. Once i told myself I liked her its like I wanted to keep that ........ make that true. Same thing w/ diana. screw that! I don't like them in that way. I let a little infatuation seem like more than that. The only person I think I really like is lynda. (im talkin bout ppl other thatn ave right now) So this sucks cus she's 4 years older than me. Hell she told me it wouldn't work, cus apperantly  PG 4   she likes me too. Amazing how age makes all the difference in how you see people and how you interact with them. I feel like me and her broke at least a few of those barriers. But i still feel like i'm treated as younger than her. Thats sad. Its just sad that i feel i cant change that. whats kewl though is that I proved that you can like someone purely by personality. Lynda has never seen me and I am one of her best friends. To quote her "It's too bad you're 4 years too young." Though while i say that I picture her face showing sarcasm. That tells me that you can never tell someone you love them anywhere but face to face. Ave ....... i can't believe your words until I hear them in your presence.   I hope nothing I say devalues what I think of you. I really do love you. But I can't give  PG 5   Those words meaning unless I tell you while locking eyes. Only 20 or 19 days left for me to be able to prove my words :) I can't really FEEL like I  love you unless  I have you near ...... I can only KNOW I do.                                               Coldplay - The Scientist  "Questions of science, science and progress / do not speak as loud as / my heart"  They said it better than I ever could. My brain isn't the part of me connected to you....... my heart is. My brain can only acknowledge that.   You know? This whole write up Sparked after talking to just ONE person. I want to thank you aaron. Thanks to you I have so much put into perspective. Another one of my lil philosphies comes up (althought I'm sure someone thought of it by now) "everything you say and do   PG 6   affects everyone around you. Your very existance has the power to shape the existance of all those on earth." We're all mystically linked to one another. This is an awesome power.                                             "with great power comes great responsibility" A quote from Peter Parker's uncle in Spider-man. If this is corny, then corn me up. It's what I believe to be truth.  I'm reminded of a conversation w/ lynda i had last night/this morning. I was talking abotu ......... she asked "shouldn't you be doing homework?" We were having an amazing chat. I replied "I'd rather lose my sleep talking to my friends than having work as my #1 priority and losingmy sanity"                                              Our Lady Peace - Happiness and the Fish "Talking is just   PG 7   masturbating without the mess." once again, someone already said it best.   this felt great. Lets do it again real soon :)
