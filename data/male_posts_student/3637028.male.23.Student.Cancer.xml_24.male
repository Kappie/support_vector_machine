I've got the added bonus (HA!) of moving about 900 miles about two weeks from now to Houston which is even hotter (I'm so glad it's August) than St. Louis. I did get accepted to  urlLink University of Houston - Downtown  though, so I don't have to worry any more about what I'm going to do this fall. I'm planning on going to Houston for a few days either later this week or early next week so I can register for classes. I don't start until August 23rd (almost September by then) so I've got a week of living in my dad's three room apartment or trying to figure out some place else to chill out of town for a few days so I don't go crazy having to be so close to my family. Anybody want to house and feed me for a couple of days with no chance of receiving money for your services?  urlLink Still haven't gotten that fucking bumper fixed... DAMMIT!  I found out my right blinker is falling off too and the claims guy said that it was a separate incident. Luckily none of this happened in August, or August would have some 'splaining to do.
