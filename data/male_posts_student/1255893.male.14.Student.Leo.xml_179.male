RICHARD SIMMONS ROCKS! ooooooh boy.  funny shizzle :-p   well I should be doin HW right now but uh ....... yeah. and y does it look like someone left a comment on my last post? I clicked on it and I dont see anything. bleh, if someone DID leave a commment please do it again cus I wanna read. Holy Jebus. Might be goin out this weekend, but I aint too sure, I aint actually sure i wanna go. I kinda wish I hung out with more gurls. Most of the guys I hang out with dont really like to make conversation ...... or at least we can't think of a good topic. I remember in 8th grade, me, Ave, Cathy and Kaitlyn would actually make conversation ...... I miss that. but well, it'll take a while to get that back. The only one of them I have a chance of talkin to is Cathy, unless I wanna risk Kaitlyn goin bi-polar on me. Or maybe its not the conversation stuff as much as me gettin sick of guys after months of jus horsin around and doin nuthin. I dern even know what the hell Im sayin anymore. All i know is I miss 8th grade. I mean, I got to hang out with the gurl I wuv ya know? I had my whole crew, or I guess I should say crews. Not to say I don't love our hang out n stuff ... but like, I derno. Eh, we'll see if I can make sense outta this later ...... but if someone thinks they can help, by all means go ahead. L8err
