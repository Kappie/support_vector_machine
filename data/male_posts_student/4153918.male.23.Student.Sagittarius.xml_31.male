( I wsa thinking who will be the first guy/gal to post after hectic week)  I have to share a joke sent to me by one o f my friends. I 'll just paste here for all of u    The Perfect Couple  Once: upon a time, a perfect man and a perfectwoman met.   After a  perfect friendship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life togetherwas,  of course, perfect.    One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfectcouple was drivingtheir  perfect car along a winding road, when theynoticed someone at theside  of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple,they stopped to  help.   There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle oftoys. Not wanting to  disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas,the perfect couple  loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soonthey weredriving  along delivering the toys.  Unfortunately, thedriving conditions  deteriorated and the perfect couple; and SantaClaus had anaccident.    Only one of them survived the accident.  Question: Who was the survivor?       Answer: The perfect woman survived. She's the onlyone who really  existed in the first place.  (Everyone knows thereis no Santa Clausand  there is no such thing as a perfect man. )   Women stop reading here, this is the end ofthe joke.  **** Men keep scrolling.      So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus ,the woman musthave  been driving.  This explains why there was a car accident. Men Keep scrolling   >
