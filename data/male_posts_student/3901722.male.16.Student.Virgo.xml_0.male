Then my g/f called, she sounded irritated (I told her I would call her as soon as I woke up, oops :$). It's her grandma's b-day, and well, she doesn't want to go, maybe that's why she's irritated.  around 2:30 I called the airport to ask what time my friend's flight would arrive, they told me it would arrive at 4:15. The plane was exactly on time, however it took forever for them to get through customs, something about smuggeling a drive shaft or something, I dunno...  Afterwards me and my friend, let's call him Jason, we went grocerie shopping, that was hillarious. Word of advice, don't get in a car with him. He takes a corner at 60 MPH, that's just phsyco... We drove around for a bit, scaring the shit out of ppl by the way he drives, and then came over to my house, to talk and play counter-strike. That was pretty fun.  Tomorrow I'm going to my g/f's house, hopefully she'll be in a good mood. After that we're going to watch a movie or too, and I'll prolly spend the rest of the night playing games, prolly nfs hp2 (I know it's an old game, but it's still fun).  Right now I'm going to do the dishes and go to bed.  until we meet again
