But, the beauty of blogging is that we get to open our random and developing thoughts to comment by others so that we can adjust and fine-tune them. So here it goes: Here's my impression of the place of third parties, and the Libertarian Party in particular, in the American political system.  The major American parties are essentially coalition parties that form before an election, rather than, as in our European counterparts, after an election. The truth of this can be observed in the fact that members of single factions within a party, such as the libertarians or evangelical Christians in the Republican Party, or the environmentalists or civil libertarians in the Democratic Party, persistently wail that the rest of the party has lost its backbone, gives in to its opponents, has sold its soul to the Devil, and simply no longer looks like “them.” As in all coalitions, party coalitions share several transcendent themes, such as limited government or progressive government. But these themes themselves are bifurcated and shift in emphasis depending on the cultural and political climate of the day. Libertarian members of the Republican Party enjoyed a prominent position in the years leading up to and including the Reagan Administration because of the problems created by the post-New Deal boom in government. In recent times, the so-called neocons have dominated in a climate of terrorism and national security. Both sides share many common beliefs, but not so much that they don’t still maintain their separate affinities and identities.  This is where third parties come in. First, third parties surface when, while in the governing coalition, they feel dissatisfied with the way their coalition is running things. Examples on point: the Libertarian Party arose during the big-spending Nixon administration; Ross Perot’s Libertarian-leaning Reform Party during George H.W. Bush’s centrist administration; and Ralph Nader and the Green Party during centrist Bill Clinton’s administration. In each instance, the effect of the defection was to weaken the governing coalition and hand control of government to the opposing coalition party, the proverbial “heads you lose, tails you lose,” as the switch had the effect of handing government from a potential ally to a clear enemy.  The Libertarian party, however, is an odd duck. In truth, though the LP’s free-market, anti-welfare state principles find more in common with the Republicans, their general anything-goes, absolute liberty presumptions also attract a number of left-leaning civil libertarians to their ranks. These folks, once convinced that the LP does not match their Republican brethren in repugnant religious zeal, find in the LP a group of agnostic and pro-marihuana hippies they can easily identify with.  So, what effect the formation and growth of the Libertarian Party? Overall, the presence of an active LP lessens the influence of libertarian thought in either party, and correspondingly, lessens their influence in government. This statement, however, deserves some explanation. First, there are relatively few consistent Libertarian (big “L”) voters out there, and even fewer Libertarian candidates. The Libertarians’ loss of influence, therefore, does not happen at the polls. The real loss is in terms of the libertarian (little “l”) politicos. These are the folks who would (and in past administrations, did) actively work for Republican (and Democratic) officials or governments, but have instead thrown their lot in with a separate Libertarian third party where their influence in government is nil. Instead of working for reforms from within the fortress, where many were quite successful in the past, they have tried to storm the ramparts from outside, and all without the benefits of a coalition.  The result of a separate Libertarian Party therefore is to go from having some libertarian influence in government by operating within one of the coalition parties, to having no influence. The LPers may feel better about themselves, but they’ll wind up with worse, not better government (at least from their perspective).  There is a final chapter to this story. Often following the third-party split and fall of the ruling coalition, both the newly-defeated coalition party and the prodigal third-party re-form to defeat the common enemy. From the perspective of the third party, they have won by forcing the coalition in their direction. The cycle, of course, usually repeats because the ruling coalition must have 51% to win. In the Libertarian Party phenomenon, however, the advent of a LP coalition that includes a left-leaning faction could permanently dampen the LP’s chances of rejoining a ruling coalition, as the new commitment by leftists will permanently lock the Libertarian Party out of any ruling coalition.  To recap, by not participating in the major coalition parties, libertarians have significantly lessened their influence in government. If the libertarians feel perpetually left out of the Republican Party, they only have the Libertarian Party to blame.
