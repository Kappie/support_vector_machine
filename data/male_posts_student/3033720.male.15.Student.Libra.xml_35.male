That rule is really stupid....and I think Mrs. Connor shoulda told him before he got the slip....oh well. I sat with John Weiss at lunch today. Those few moments were the most excited (and aroused) I've ever been. He has big arms. Very masculine. He sexed up Treffner's sister....ha.....serves Dustin right for stealing my name. From now on I guess I'll just go by my middle name....so from now on, I'm Mitch. I should change the name of this blog to Mitch's Nich.....nah, then everyone would call me Mitch. Well, I think I'm gonna go. I love you all.....in an unhealthy stalker rapist way. Just dont forget that. Ever.   I'm feeling so weird right now........
