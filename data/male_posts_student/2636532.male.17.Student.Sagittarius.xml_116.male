Secondly, IP addresses are fun! i'm leaving them there for now til he sees them then i'll delete them, aaaaaaaand maybe block you as well. Thirdly, only i can make crude comments about errol's ass, simple as that! i own it dammit (you know i do errol), in other words even if i may take shots at him all the time, you can't because he has my protection. Fourthly, you can't bring that trash in here! this is MY HOUSE *hits fist to chest* -Matt: Ruler of this site and all who read it!
