I officially have a spending problem....I bought my 7th DVD of the month yesterday (it was the quality flick Snatch)....folks there is a definate problem here....the thing that scares me is that as soon as I buy one DVD I want, 3 more pop up in my head (T2, Jungle Fever, and Carlito's Way)  OJ, I usually don't address allegations of "wrist drop" (inside med school joke....I'll explain if you want to know), however you raise a valid point....niggas usually do not brag about CK pants....however these are no ordinary pair of pants....they are silk lined suit pants made from the finest something or the other....please believe the ladies were liking them dude!  which brings me to my next point....why was I treating the lab partner to dinner at Chili's (minor caking....and that leads to a story for another post) and I start to go into my normal routine about who the cute girls in our class are....and I realize it's too many fine ladies in my class for me to be single at this point....all future doctors and dentists too!....I am slipping....  Okay back to DVDs....so I watched Memento yesterday....maybe it was the fatigue setting in or whatever but I was left kind of bewildered....I mean don't get me wrong....I understood the jist of the movie but for the first time in years, (probably since I was 11 and saw Silence of the Lambs for the first time...) I was left dazed afterward....has anyone else seen this movie?....am I just losing my touch?  Why was I compelled to defy my incredibly slow AOL dial up connection at the crib and download "Differences" by Ginuwine?....normally his voice inspires me to throw things but I am really feeling this song....I mean I'm walking around singing off key, "My whole life has changed"....maybe it was the fact that our cable went out....  Never will a roommate 6 months removed cause the Killa to be cableless again....my roommate and good buddy Crystal's last roommate is a complete jackass who did not pay her share of the cable, ummm, sometime LAST YEAR!....so now comcast's bootleg ass has decided to deprive me of my Howard Stern fix....damn them!  Lastly, why has no one heard the top secret and ultra hot Girls, Girls, Girls remix at the very end of The Blueprint?....it's the absolute hotness!....trust me on that one....the dude singing in the intro is wilding....it's some song from the 70's and the dude says, "I'm not a one girl's guy/and they know it/when it comes to love I don't lie/and the girls respect me for it/ain't gonna say my nose can't be open/but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from..."and then the hot beat kicks in....it starts 7:52 into track 13 and is well worth the effort....  I have the feeling I'll be back posting soon....just seems like one of those Limp Bizkit "Break Stuff" days....holla!
