We have SO MUCH BIOLOGY it's ridiculous, I haven't understood Math since Mrs. Sibenac was replaced halfway through the year because she was PREGNANT, and English is crazy because we've barely gone over poetry and we already had our last class. History will be easy, Religion is boring and easy, Spanish is  también muy fácil , and Art has no final. Plus I have Gym tomorrow.  BUT besides all that, I've had a pretty good day. We were doing mythology in History and that's fun (plus I know all of it), and I have something to look forward to tomorrow: getting back my essay grade for English.  I get to see "The Prisoner of Azkaban" on the 4th at Loews'. At least that'll be fun. I'm going with Mallory Fuchs. Plus JR Stragar will be there. Haha, OATS. (
