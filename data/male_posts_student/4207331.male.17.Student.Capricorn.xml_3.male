His actual message was:  Dear Ben Thank you for your interest in our Nalgene Brand outdoor bottles.  In response to your inquiry, the maximum use temperature of both the closure and bottle is 135 degrees Celsius and can be used in a microwave.  It should not be a problem to boil water in it in the microwave.  However I do not have any pressure ratings on the bottle. If you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to contact me directly at xxxxxxx@nalgenunc.com  Sincerely Jim Havens  I shall go and conduct this experiment.  Pray for the best  -Ben Salinas
