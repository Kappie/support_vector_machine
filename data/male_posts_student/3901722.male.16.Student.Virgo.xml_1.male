Obviously I'm a LOTR fan. I also Like the Matrix, but that's not half as good as LOTR. I've seen the LOTR trilogy tons of times, and I'm still not fed up with it. Come to think of it, there aren't many movies I think are worth watching twice, except those phsycological movies which you have to see like 2 or 3 times before you actually get it.  Earlier this evening I watched "The Butterfly Effect", that one was really horrible. I mean, the idea of being able to change the past is awesome, but the movie hardly delivers. I thought of it as something to keep you busy for almost 2 hours. Yesterday I saw "Secret Window", which I actually did kind of like, but the story wasn't that fucked up that I have to watch it twice to get it.  Well let's see, tomorrow's monday, My best friend is coming here on vacation, from Holland. Yes, he has also left to attend College there. I hate having friends who are older than me, they always leave, and I have to make new friends, that sucks ass. What sucks even more is that my girlfriend is leaving for Holland soon, and I won't get to see her till december. Fuck it's gonna be hard without her.  I hate to see my friends go, but what sucks even more is if they fail there exams and have to do the whole damn year over. Now that's not such a bad thing if ur not in the final year, but they were, and they have to go through the same shit all over again.   I've been down that path, but I was in 3rd grade (of the 5), which isn't half bad. It was quite fun actually, I only failed in a couple of courses, mostly french and spanish, but I also didnt perform well in history. The second year in the 3rd grade was a breeze, I still remembered all the crap from the year before, and cheated on all my french and spanish exams. As for history, that year we got different topics, topics that I was actually really interested in, like WWII and Vietnam. so I passed with flying colors.  Right now I'm heading for my final year, I think I'm going to pass, well I hope so... 4th grade was pretty easy, so I don't see why 5th grade should be so hard.  After that, I'm heading straight to Holland, never to return again (well, maybe on vacation or that sort of thing). I'm going to study either system management, or computer consultant, eitherway, something in the IT industry. I love working with computers. I'm also into gaming, it's like an addiction, can't keep my hands off it. I often go to LAN party's and try my luck there.   Well it's almost 2 'o clock here, and I think it's bed time, I just have to do the dishes and off to bed!
