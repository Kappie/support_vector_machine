TUESDAY: So easy...did nothing but discuss ebay, blackadder and cliff jumping all morning. Then double PE...always fun. Suprisingly, Holly  didn't  mention asking Nat out once on the way home. Not once! Though she did tell me REPEATED TIMES exactly where she and Nat would be on Friday, and how I should join them. Pffffft. Stayed up past midnight doing cwk *shudder* kinda fell asleep working, so half my citizenship will probably be stuff like "76yhbygh vtxfcred4f" - Yes, that was the result of hitting my head against the keyboard. Seriously! And oh well.  WEDNESDAY: Wooo, field re-opened. Whoopee-yayness. Handed in IT and citizenship cwk, as well as the french convo book which was due in....about a month ago? So me sorta happy 'cos thats 95ish% of all my work done. And the rest is so easy I could do it in my schleeeeeep. Walking to IT was....interesting. Several plots involving setting hundreds of water snakes into the sewage system were revealed, ending in a great mental image of someone running into a hospital: *Nurse* "How may I help you sir?" *Random person, butting in* "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, A SNAKE BIT MY ASS!!!"  IT itself was fun, as usual. Those random conversations with Nat get kah-ray-zee-er every time. And pretty much everyone said how we're exactly like each other. Hmmm. Bah. Then Katie did her subtle thingo...lol. *Row in IT goes Katie - Me - Nat* *Katie* "Pssst...hey Nat...you going to the prom with Ben?" *Nat* "Yeah" *Katie* "Really? Do you think he can hear us?"  Katie really needs her head examined. She also told us that she'd had to block ebay from her home comp so she didn't get tempted to buy more Busted concert tickets. THEY SUCK DAMNIT!  Heh. Tomorrow is the last day of term...and I won't be there for half of it. Yayness. Then on Saturday...the Bristol City VS QPR match. Another golden oppertunity for my dad to make himself look like a complete idiot. Oh well. Should be fun.  In the words of collective soul: "oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one.....oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one....."
