"no i don't care about that, are YOU alright?" came back, i wanted to hit against the wall outside the american gym but i ran into '05 painting the sheds next to the track. it was hot but fun, everyone drove each other's car, thi and jesha stole my bike and rode off into the dust-infested sunset, jen worked out her supermodel muscles painting a shed white with the long pole paint roller (me to alex m: "normally i wouldn't touch you with a 12 foot pole, but considering i have one here"), alex drove by kicking up dust and turned the shed brown. o yea, i had hella dreams last night, like the one where everyone was on this huge bed of kat's wishing her happy birthday like some sort of ceremony, another this freshman in my art class was crying, same dream pat made fun of my buddy list screenname by screenname, another the ravens killed some other team in football, then i woke up and thought it was sunday. then we cleaned up the paint in the boys' bathroom (tiffany: "can we use those sinks too?" "...those are urinals") and i went home.
