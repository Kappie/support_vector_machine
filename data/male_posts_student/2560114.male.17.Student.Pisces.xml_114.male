We talked about some certain thangz and i found out some new onez aswell...interesting...very interesting. Hhhhanywayz we went to topperz and chilled wit jizzy and ate some pizza...uh duh...yeah and we jus kicked it at mattz crib.  Saturday... Well we had a tourney so yeah...here it goes. Well we beat Santa Ynez, Newbury Park, and Almonty...but we lost to Mt. Carmel...GAHH!!!!...then we lost in playoffs in the first round to westlake...yeah...overall i thought we did alright, but i played like shit, cuz i wasnt gettin the killz that i was use to gettin, probly cuz they alwayz fuckin put 2 or sometimez 3 blockerz on my ass...r they that scared of me?...i guess so. Yeah then like afta the gamez against santa ynez and newbury park, i kinda took a walk and exploring the campus. I basically tried to think thingz through and tryin to figure out what am i gonna do with myself once all these thingz i have predicted happenz...i guess i will jus have to c or i will try to make the best of thingz. Then we lost in the 1st round of playoffz to westlake, it was close, but yeah...we lost. Afta the tourney i went to the habit wit jizzy, matt, davies, and mattz and jizzy'z folkz...then i went ova to joeyz party cuz it was his b-day.  Whatz on my mind... Well i hate whatz on my mind right now, i should b thinkin about other thingz instead of this shit, well at lunch when they were all together, i jus had to leave cuz i was like "i aint takin this infront of my face" so i did the reasonable thing and jus walked away...then matt gave me the low down, and i was like "yuh know, whatever makez them happy cuz i dont wanna get in the middle of this shit."...if theyre happy, ill b alright i guess, i jus have to get use to this shit, cuz i guess its gonna last...i jus want the best for everyone, i jus have to go back to my oldz wayz and try to find a way to b happy...hangin wit my friendz helped, but yeah...i jus have to deal wit this shit...lata.   This Weekz Grade:...fuck it Insight....fuck it
