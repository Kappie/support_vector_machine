My Current Age cycle = 23 Standard Terran Years Now this status will be changing....well not too soon but it's not very far away either....will keep you posted.  Currently I'm still serving my National Service on my tiny little island (but it's home nevertheless). The official date is 20021213 but in another 9 1/2 weeks I will be clearing whatever leave I have left over.    >   W00T! yesss! Feel the joy!....  Also another event on the way is the commencement date of my Advance Diploma in Information Communications.  Good to be hitting the books again. Not everyone will agree but then again....pls   >  my current situation.  Other than these, nothing much to report...well nothing I would care to bore you with at the moment. Maybe some day, when I'm low on content, I'll post about my adventures overseas. (Starlight,Starbright...anyone?)  Here are some minor status regs: Food: Still like my western meat dishes but starting to cut down on alot of rich foods like seafood and dairy products (no more ben sob!) Music: still hooked on my rock,retro, acid jazz....need to find out more about emo....those in the know would wonder what took me so long to get in to it Hobbies: Still jacked into computers, hardware, software, internet and computer games.... of particular note is my love for Palm OS PDA's.  I will write my takes and reviews on the IT stuff and may even post up some IT tips and tricks I come across...of course I can't be everywhere in the Grid at the same time so please post up stuff that you come across. Once again a big   >  out to dex for getting my foot in to Blogging....this one for you bro...  Anyone needs some tech support, feel free to drop me a line. If I don't know it, I can most certainly find the answer...at the very least I will try.   >   oops! Timed out...
