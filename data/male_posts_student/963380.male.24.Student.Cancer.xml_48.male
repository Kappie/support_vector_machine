Shoots his bolt, deals himself short, cries over his own spilt milk and/or laments the loss of his marbles through the utter embarassment of himself in public. There are a few reasons that this can happen 1) the chap may be drunk 2) the chap may be a belligerent asshole and no one noticed and or 3)the poor bitch has a brain tumour and no one has noticed yet.  So we've got this yahoo - this complete dork from Saskatchewan. He's in charge of the First Nations out there (which is a bit of a joke, but that's a bridge I'll cross later). He makes a statement claiming that the Nazi's had the right idea when they fried six million Jews. Yikes. I'm thinking this dude has a tumour of some sort - he's 69, he's an angry native (*giggle*) and he lost control of his gums. Thankfully they found a way to shut him up.  Speaking of shutting the aboriginals up - what's the deal with them anyway? Seriously? I've met a few nice ones, but for the most part they're simply angry bitter mean people - kinda like the slavs, but with more of a hokey mumbojumbo mysticism about them. Fuck, England was invaded countless times, as was Germany. Do you see these nations trying to extract reparations out of any of their conquerors? Unfortunately what's happened is the imperialists developed a conscience. Would have honestly been a better thing to simply assimilate and stifle, much like what has happened to European cultures for thousands of years. Darwin was much righter than all of us think.   So that's my controversial viewpoint of the day. It might be motivated by the fact that everytime I get a native into the store who asks for their tax credit, there's some sort of scam going on (I shit you not, EVERY time) and potentially the fact that about 12 out of the 14 natives I can recall encountering were rude to me. Don't hate me cause I'm white. Hate me cause I'm an asshole.
