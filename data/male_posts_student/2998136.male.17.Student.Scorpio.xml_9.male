Last month I was involved in the Art Fista organised by Path Production, which is the company my school modern dance instructor is working in. It was a Friday to Sunday event at the Istana Park. Guess what? I am to be body-painted the whole day throughout the whole event, not only I have to perform on stage, I have to walk around orchard as a pathetic and miserable statue giving out balloons which always fly off from the stick.  But I don't mind anyway because there will be free hair-styling and futhermore they dye your hair. So I thought I could give it a try and performing for the event would earn me high CCA points and CIP hours. Our  sponsor is Jean Yip Group and they will be playing around with our hairs, my theme colour chosen is gold. They ran out of this colour and they dyed my hair brown. I am the only statue with brown hair and I love my hairstyle so much I wouldn't want to wash off when I reached home. It was way too cool, I bet I will never admire other guys' hairstyle unless it's done by Jean Jip. They are so professional.  On Saturday and Sunday, I went about scaring and frightening kids away at Heerens and Plaza Singapure before I could give them balloons. A few passer-bys were being busybody and took a few photos of us to report to the police or sue us to the court for scaring kids away. We were gone by then when the police arrived. When we were walking along Orchard, many people stared at us as if we were aliens from outter space doing window-shopping in Singapore and they stayed a distance away from us as if we are contracted from SARS.  Now if you were at there during that time spotted a few statues and had shoot a few pictures of statues even if that's not me, please send the picture to me at  urlLink xing_yi@kon-x.com . I would like to collect them, thank you!
