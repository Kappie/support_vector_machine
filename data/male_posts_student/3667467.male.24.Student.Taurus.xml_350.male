Let's show an example of everyday use:  X: Man, it's hot out.  Y: No kidding, dude. My BDI is four from the floor.  Z: Heck, mine are still waiting in the car with the AC on.  X: C'mon Z, we told you not to wear a sweater!   Now let's show a very different situation:  X: There's no heat in this pool!  Y: My BDI is in my stomach!  Z: My BDI broke off!  X: C'mon Z, we all know you're Jewish!   --A public service announcement from The President's Council on Physical Fitness.--
