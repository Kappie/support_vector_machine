I lay there in the sand, my last place of solace, my last place of belonging -  thinking of what might have happened between the two of us if I have only stayed in the city.  But, fate dictated our lives and though it is true love’s fibers that fabricates our two souls together, the circumstances are against us.  The sea in front of me appears unreachable, an immense element that can never be grasped.  The crimson sky encompasses the horizon with much melancholy that all substance of happiness has flown out of my body.  The breeze is not comforting at all as I welcome with wholeness, the feeling I dreaded most – loneliness.  	I was a freshman in the State University when I first met her.  I was studying under a tree when she suddenly appeared in front of me and asked if I could help her in her term paper on Crisanto Evangelista.  We were both famous back then.  In my case, I was the freshman walking encyclopedia who ventures mostly on the revolutionary struggle of the Filipinos.  She, on the other hand, was famous for her intoxicating beauty and glaring riches.  She was the daughter of a crony capitalist but at the same time, the dream in the eyes of the proletarian students, for everyday, her beauty immediately vibrates throughout the campus as she walks out of the limousine.  I couldn’t believe it back then that she was talking to me.  She, the embodiment of a goddess, was in front of me – a street rat with only a peso in his pocket.  Of course, I gladly agreed with my heart throbbing with joy.   She smiled and took my hand.  She led me to her limo and for the first time, I was indulged in the cold profligacy of the rich and warm comfort of her presence.  	She held my hand with intimacy and sidled with me.  The closeness was alluring, a poisonous honey to which I want to succumb.  She told me she was an avid fan of my writing.  I merely nodded.  She kept asking about my personal life and all I answered was silence.  I couldn’t tell her that I belonged to the lower class, though I think she already knew because of the clothes I had been wearing.  She looked at me with her clear eyes that reflect eternity and questioned why my mouth was shut tight.  Silence.  All I could do was inhale her breath with deep reverie.  She leaned on my shoulders and her eyes closed.  I looked out the window to see the sun’s effulgence fading beyond the Manila Bay.  	The limo came to a halt.  My eyes glistened, for the vehicle stopped in front of Manila Hotel.  She woke up and told me that she would treat me for dinner.  I would like to refuse then but somehow, minutes later, I found myself inside the hotel.  When I had been presented with the menu, my eyes and mouth widened.  I was speechless in disbelief.  The names of the delicacies were not in my vocabulary and the prices were over the roof and probably even over the sky.  She laughed as she witnessed my split-second trance.  To free me from shame, she was the one who ordered.  	A sparkle of delight, or shall I say, love entered in my eyes when I saw her manner of eating.  She put the spoon between her two lips ever so gently, ever so tenderly.  After eating, her eyes gazed at mine.  The thread of love bonded them.  I shook my head with eyes closed, as if waking from a daydream.  Bowed, I said that her term paper would be finished the next day.  I left, walking back to my plain reality.  	On the next day, true to my words, I gave her the term paper.  She thanked me with her cherubic smile.  I thought that was the end of my relations with but as I was about to leave, she asked if we could go out together.  I nodded, treading softly to a dream that could never be.  	The days that followed were pervaded with an ethereal coexistence between the two nuclei of our felicitous emotions.  There were strolls in the park, lolls in the beach, lullabies in the halls to lull our eyes that have been jaded of looking at each other.  The great disparity that alienates our two class seemed just an oblivious matter.  I guessed that was what the philosophical imbalance called love could do.  But, I was wrong.  Reality will always be reality.  	It was dusk and great somber crept through the shores.  It was time to separate the supposedly inseparable bind of God for us.  Her tears flowed down her clear pallid face.  She still looked angelic even if she was crying.  Her embrace encroached my presence and I surrendered to her caress.  But, we both knew this is not our fate.  The indictment of society towards our togetherness obliterated even the whole essence of love itself.  I had my own principles and she had hers.  She lived in a mansion, and I would be in the mountains.  She is rich and I, poor.  What a castrating cliché! But, for the balance, yin-yang, to progress, we, the polars of our world, should stay apart.  But was not love, faith and hope created to unbalance the equilibrium of this science-bound world?   	Our lips met. Her breath was life, immortality even.  I succumbed at last to her wish and our oneness was complete but the dream was over.  The mountains awaited me.  	The waves seem to be closing in on my wounded body.  Do these mighty waves see my past, my life, my future?  The sun seemed to moved farther away.  I looked up but I saw a cloudless sky with no birds.  My eyesight is failing but I know that it is already dusk again.  I walk towards the sea.  I can reach it.  I must reach it.  The waves are rising.  I raised my two bloodied arms and shouted to the heavens her name.  Then, darkness.
