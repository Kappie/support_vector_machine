First this morn, i went and took the AP US History exam, it wasnt too bad at all! then i checked out of school and went to wash my car and get gas.  that took way to long and then bry came over and we tried to go swimmin lol.  after that i said bye to jes at MC (shes headed to ole miss 4 graduation) and erin and katie tried to get their picture thing for art to work overhere but it wouldnt so they left.  then i got rdy for the sport banquet.  at that thing i got best defensive player for football and the coaches award for tennis (which i renamed the ms nichols likes michael award haha kinda scary though!)  poor bry though he didnt get a football one, i though he would this year.  after the banquet, i dropped my mom off and headed to the party at mikeys house.  Thats where the night was fun/interesting/entertaining.  i picked up a couple of ppl on the way there to be the DD (i was in no mood to drink right now b/c of all that has been going on with my dad latley) I had a really good time at mikeys though, i saw alot of ppl i hadnt seen in a long time there were TONS of ppl there :) at about 11 the cops came to mikeys house and so me and my drunk car load went around the back through the fence and drove away safley lol! then we congegrated on a street somewhere eles for about 45 min that was a lil more boring but still interesting.  humm then between about 12 and 12 15 i dropped everybody off and headed home.  and now im here!  it as a very full day! a good one though and school is comming quickly to a close! its great! hope everyone is doing good most parts of my life are just wonderful right now! im off to bed b/c i gotta help on an eagle project tomorrow early and get my sholder checked (it still makes funny noises when i move is hahaha) g'night everyone! love u!
