For a hypothetical situation let us say that I am watching Dumb and Dumber...and enjoying it...HARRY YOUR HANDS ARE FREEZING...MOCKING BIRD...TIC TAC SIR...yeah you know.  Now let us also say that we are at the point where Harry's leg is on fire. (for those of you who have not seen the movie or don't care i shall paraphrase,  Harry the idiot is hitting on some chick and accidentally catches his leg on fire, needless to say everything goes to hell)  I am watching this laughing hysterically when someone across the rooms starts making brilliant observations like: "This movie is Dumb"  "Why didn't he tell her that his leg was on fire and then come back" "Where's the mountain dew".  I will respond to these people in order of 1,2,and 3. 1) Yes the movie is dumb.  Look at the freaking title and then tell what the intellectual value of this movie is.  Why are you saying these things.  What are you trying to prove.  Of course the movie is dumb.  It is about two very dumb people and one of them happens to be dumber than the other.  Get a dang grip you pompous bag of monkey excrement.  2)  I'll tell you why and this ties in with my previous answer.  Harry is an idiot.  Do you know why.  A writer wrote a part and Jeff Daniels is playing it.  Now if you are still boggled why Jeff Daniels is acting so dumb let me spell it out for you.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.  He is being payed obscene amounts of money doing what you do everyday for free.  3)  In the fridge DUH.
