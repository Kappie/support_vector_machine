If you haven't seen the movie and do not wantit spoiled, I recommend not reading any further, as it will be difficult for me tooffer my thoughts on this one without exposing some of theplot's mysteries.   Aside from some nice  urlLink photography  and expectedly good performances from  urlLink William Hurt  and  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix , the movie seemed scattered, especially for the first two-thirds of its running time. There were several moments during thislongish beginning stretch that I was really itching for the plot to begin. When it finally did, I must admit that I wasn't all that enthralled with finding out what would happen. Nonetheless, I was no longer quite as frustratedafter the story finally started coming together. Now, some may object to all of that, claiming that the whole point to the movie is to keep people guessing and wondering about the film's direction, which crescendos  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan -style with a twist at the end. But when compared to   urlLink The Sixth Sense  , the end "twist" didn't really strike me as a twist at all, but more as a revealing of who the creatures were,why the village existed, and a justificationof the poor attempts at colonial-era dialogue that periodically plaugued much of the first half. Shyamalan is known for his unexpected finishes, but what was revealed at the end of this film left something to be desired. It's one thing for a movie to have a mind-blowing twist at the end if the story has directly built up to it and the final revelation has substance(as in  The Sixth Sense ), but if the ending barely exposes why you had to sit through scattered scenes andcrypticexchanges between characters for1.5 hours, it leaves me wondering, "What's the point?"Although scatterednessisn't necessarily bad if the ending makes it worthwhile, thisfinish didn't accomplish that, at least for me. It seemed thatShyamalan's goals wereonly tostartle the audience at various pointsand to utilizesurprise-story-tellingdevices within a ratherweak story. (I'm surea weak story wasn't his goal however).Thesegoals aren't bad in and of themselves, but when coupled with astory- quaesitumno deeper than the creation of a communal utopia to protect your children from the big, bad world, it becomesnothing more than afilm exercise. This all seems a bit harsh, but I think I'm biased against the idea of going to extremes toshield children from the world's depravity. While I don't believe kids should be immersed in evil, there's something about creating a false world in order to preserve their innocence that doesn't settle right with me, which is why I didn't enjoy   urlLink Life Is Beautiful   much either. You can create the fallacious community, butwhen thesin still follows you there, how do you explainthe hoaxtothe lab-test subjects? I don't think evil should be dwelt upon, but it must be recognized to arrive at the truth about the world.  While not a horrible movie, The Village  left me wanting something more. 5/10
