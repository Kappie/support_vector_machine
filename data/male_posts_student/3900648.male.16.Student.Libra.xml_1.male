So anyways, the past few days I've done more sailing of course, and started work on a computer for my dad's project business thingy, star drug testing. In my sailing class I've moved up to the laser. It's a lot more fun than a sabot. Faster, and a lot more fun to capsize. With a laser, when you capsize you can just jump up onto the side, then down onto the centerboard. That tilts the boat upright, so you just jump in when its about 45 degrees above the water. I've done that a few times by now.     Another fun thing you can do with a laser is hiking way out. Of course that's more than just a fun thing you get to do, but a requirement of keeping your boat upright. Today I discovered the great funnage to be had in dunking your head underwater while leaning way out off of your boat trying to keep it upright. ...Damned run-on sentence.     Ok then, so sailing is much fun. Oh, and I have 6 new shirts. four of them are the same color. I like it. And this way I don't have to worry about having shirts come school. Ugh. School. I don't want to go back.     Enough rambling.  post!
