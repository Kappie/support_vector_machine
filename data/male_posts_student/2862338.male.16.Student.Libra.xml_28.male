This is how the day went though.  basically, nothing happned in the morning, i did the wake up thing, and got online to check the e-mail...turns out mike didn't like what i wrote, which is understandable...but i think he took it way to seriously, it's about what i said about him not going to the gym and stuff at the bottom of the 17th entry.  well, like i told him, and like i tell furture peoplez who decide to get pissed at me....what do u expect? i mean seriosly, when i say shit, it's VERY obviously  something real that the person knows he/she is doing.  Like that thing about mike pickin his arms, that completely came off like him trying to show off arm muscle.  He told me it wasn't, which is cool, and now i know, but it's juss something i thought he KNEW he was doing, thats why i said it.  Now, i do admit, it did come off asshole-ish, and i was an asshole to write it, but this is a blog people, this is my vent...i'm not a violent person at all, and i hate people feeling bad and everything like that.  thats why i sent mike an email back (2 acually, but the first one is before i read what he wrote...i thought it was just what i wrote) explaining this and all that.  He still hasn't IMed me, or called, or even see me yet, so i dunno.  I definitly ain't gonna go chasing after him.  So ONCE again, whatever "bad" thing i say about someone, it's not that i hate them, thats the LAST thing, mike is a great guy, always has been.  It's just that what i say is juss stuff i notice, and just think is kinda annoying, thats all.  Sometimes i dun even mean it....hell, MOST of the time i dun even mean it, it;s just that i let out evrything n here....get it? it's like, losing a baseball game, and after that, getting pissed at someone, and just say all the "bad" things about them.  I dun really mean them, but i do...ya know? so ya, i think a great way to look at it is the way jones put it on his blog, which is linked at the top left of the page....if you dun wanna loose your place,  urlLink here's  a link.  You should go to his blog, he's got alot of things to say...i know i will.  Well, ok, now that we got that over with, back to the day.  After that, i call jones, tell him i'm ready for the ride (he gave us rides, us being me, ben, and jorge + our computers) and ya, he came and what not.  BUT, the single most shocking,  rude, random moment happend.  We were just finishing up loading the computer in, and we see Officer John (Of D.A.R.E fame) drive up the dare mobile, pretty fast,  up cedar lane (my street) while he's passing us, jones makes the joke "hide the smokes" or something along those lines.  then we laugh, hehe, haha, and then all of a sudden, we hear a screech....he backs up, does a reverse U-turn, and comes flying bac down... Now, by this time, me and Jones are already in the front seat...so anyway, he pulls up next to jones, and is like "Is there a problem?" and where like "no, were juss picking up..." and before we can finish the fauck-head goes "i saw what you fucking did.... real fucking stupid" or some shit like that, i dun veen wanna remmeber it. anyway, like expected, me and jones' are completly shock by the whole thing, and quite frankly, i still am.  I guess it makes sense thought coming from a has-been cop/wife beater/drug dealer....he'll get wats coming to him eventually.  Anyway, after that, we head over to Benny's house, and pick him up, that went by pretty smoothly, no problems really, excpet for to cops chatting their mouths away in their cars in the middle of the street.  It's shit like that that makes me wanna be a COP, so i too can go around, bending the law at will....anyway, after telling Ben the Officer John story, we head over to Jorges'.  Poor jorge though, had to bring that giant ass monitor of his, so it took awhile.  but after getting it loaded up, and telling him the Officer John Story, we finally make it to jones' house where  urlLink Andy,  and  urlLink David  were waiting.  After getting the stuff unloaded and ready, we started playing  urlLink Jedi Academy.  (we would play it ALL night) that went pretty good, but we had Andy as the extra an, so once in a while somebody wasn't playing.  but overall, the gaming went smooth, it was fun, and time wasting....just as it should be....Now, i do have to admit, dave did get alittle annoying at times, but that was only at times, and it def. wasn't a big problem.  During the middle of it  urlLink Rob  calls saying he;s heading over at 9, but he never shows....who knows why, but he didn;t miss a whole lot.  I could have done alot of important things today....like HOMEWORK...but i didn't....and i should have...but i didn't..and it's no one's fault but my own.  See, it's not that i have to do the Break assignment, but it's that i have to do ALL that, PLUS 4 other assignments i have yet to hand in....u see, last (2nd) quarter i fail APush...which completly blows....and failed APE for the second time in a row....but thats another blog entry...anyway, so ya, i'm gonna have to do that real soon....prolly tomarrow...if anyone is reading this, and would like to like, i dunno, maybe split the work or something, or maybe juss GIVE me what they have, i'm definitly willing too.  but anyway, that was pretty much the whole day.  The pic below this entry is of this really hot chick named Charisma (awsome name right?) carpenter.  No idea if thats her real name, but she;s soo hot.  She kinda looks like that chick Gina from the Gym.  SPEAKING of the gym,, i forgot to mention, iwas gonna go this afternoon with andy, but i couldn't...which sucks...but damn, i should have, even though i'm tired, i gotta go..i gotta re-build myself to were i was, or else i'll get lazy.  ya..just a personal goal...sorry bout that.  well, anyway, ya, so thats about it, i skipped some shit, but like always, it prolly wasn;t important, or it juss wasn;t important to me...wtyl (sorry about any typos..im kinda REALLY tired right now...)
