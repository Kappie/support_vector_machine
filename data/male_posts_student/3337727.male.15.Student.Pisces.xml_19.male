Those pictures I posted at FC can't do justice to it.  It really looks that awesome. When I looked in the mirror, I for once actually liked seeing my reflection. I can tell I'm going to be a picture whore when I get my digital camera, hehe.   In unrelated news, my feelings for Sana have been lessening and my affection for Steph has been increasing, which is really, really good. I've recently started having dreams about Steph, so I know where my affection lies. ^^"
