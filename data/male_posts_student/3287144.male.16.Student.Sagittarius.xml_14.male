In other news I had a rather interesting dream last night;   I'm back in the forth year and I arrive for school in my uniform but everyone else is dressed casually so I go home and change but when I get back casually dressed, everyone is in uniform and each time I change yet remain different to everyone else, no one notices that  I  am different.   Fairly easy to interpret if I say so myself. I'm fascinated by dreams, they can say so much and often with doing so little. I guess I should thank  urlLink Sigmund Freud  really - just I can't see anything sexual in being dressed differently.  Music: Radiohead - Exit Music (For A Film) Mood: Failed.
