School was over on the 26th and I only have 2 weeks left till I goto Europe (England, France, Italy) for 27 days! Then I goto Indiana for the last 2 weeks of July. Ummm, I am bored. I have to ask you this...now take all the time you need to answer...How has your Clorox been?...Tell me your answer at DeadlyY2KVirus@aol.com...hehe. Ok, I have to go, satan's here. Damn.  urlLink    Rubber bands to Shane's stomach.
