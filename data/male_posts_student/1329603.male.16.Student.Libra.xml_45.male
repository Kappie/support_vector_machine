At any rate, it was accidentaly provocative.  (Poetic) Quote of the day; "The cold dark prison cell awakes, Another dream the darkness takes. A hunger, unceasing, takes those here In the name of freedom, ringing clear. Abused, destroyed, no solace left, Yet continuing far, though pain and death Seem likely ends to what is now The only hope for mankind. How Beautiful the pain of those Whose blood runs like a scarlet rose For half the people in the world? What pain, what beauty undeserved. Another day, another life, A struggle against the deadly knife. The surgeons of this living hell Seem not to know their wives as well Will fight to see that days will dawn When women rise and see the morn Where they will ten be free. The women rise up, on one knee, They spy the wardens walking round, Their hollow footsteps on the ground. The tubes, once more, to try to cease A hunger, once again. For peace."  Jon Roskilly's   Freedom   ...What?
