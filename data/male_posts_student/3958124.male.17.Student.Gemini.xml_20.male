If you were a big cave-man with a big club, you might not get the crap beat out of you. No child support either - cave-men were home-free. Cave-men didn't have to wake up and go to work. They woke up, grabbed the nearest alcoholic fruit and went for a piss. Then, they hunted down a big piece of meat. Tell me that you wouldn't hunt a big piece of meat while drunk off fruit. That's what I thought. After a caveman whacked his meat (excuse me), killed his prey, he got to have a barbecue. EVERY NIGHT a barbecue. Heck - he'd probably get out some alcoholic berries and invite every cave-woman he could find. I wish I was a cave-man.
