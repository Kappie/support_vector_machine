I read "Catcher In The Rye" over the break because there are a lot of references to it in other media sources...Six Degrees of Seperation and Chasing Amy are two movies that the book influences, but I never really felt the significance of it.  It's a book narrated by a student our age about himself.  He's having trouble dealing with his life- he makes references to suicide, he's kind of cynical, thinks everyone's a "phony," as well as intermitently dealing with the death of his brother.  It's written coloquially (like Huck Finn only NINETEEN 50's), and it's kind of funny at times because Holden (the narrator) is such an oddball character, but it's nothing that's really going to change my life.  If you're disconnected with your surroundings and like a straightforward read, you could identify with "Catcher," or if you're Thomas, and are rooting for the nonconformist protagonist, you might really identify.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected, but I AM looking forward to "Of Mice and Men."  Love, Rob
