My mom had to get her Dutch citizenship renewed, so now she has dual citizenship (American/Dutch).  Cool.  Derek and I will do the same, in case something happens and we need to skip country.  Friday was good, actually I moped a bit, but thats good.  Derek and I practiced a lot of gung fu and then I played a lot of Final Fantasy 3.  Everyone told me things will be better, I'll bleed but not die, things like that, too.  Thats nice.... I drove around in Mt Moriah cemetary with my parents and grand..aunt.  All of us relatives ate out, and that was fun, I talked a lot with Derek, nice.  Annnnnd then we watched 'Open Range'.  I likes me some Western movies.  'Specially ones where lots of people get shot.  Hahah.  Annd then what else I slept.  This morning I saw my cousin Lindsey, whom is getting tall.  And thats what Hallbergs do, they get tall.  All my relatives, tall.  She's 12 and plays basketball at her junior high, she even has a boyfriend (ah, a little young, but who am I to say?).   We left (Derek, Me, and my parents) and I did my algebra.  After we passed St. Joseph, daddy-o let me take the wheel on the interstate and I drove us home.  Hee haa I rule.  I'd say I'm a good driver.  So thats what happened. *i am now re-doing this post, since i closed the window earlier*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I guess I am like a tennis shoe, reliable in a tough situation, good protection, warm, big, sturdy, not so showy, practical, and I do tend to wear on you.  Or at least I hope.  I still have lots of that, hope.  I hope that this spectrum of emotions(sad) wont last much longer.  I appreciate what I had and have, and now am without, for I don't know how long.  I believe in you.  I have said that before, you know.    I have known 5 minutes of happiness (I know naught of how extreme it was), and I want it to happen again.  Me at my most selfish.    Selfish and uncertain.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I remember having a simple life, I call it last year.  I had a job, and still do, and its not stressful.  School isn't stressful either.  Junkies, bad businessmen, lazy brother, sister's wedding, and everything, none of those have made MY life more complicated.  But there was one factor I hadn't counted on that makes things a little more complicated.    Why wars are fought, why people are happy with each other, this is the root.  This is what people should get high on.
