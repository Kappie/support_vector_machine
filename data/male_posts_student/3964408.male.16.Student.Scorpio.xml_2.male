BTW...I'm not out to my sister, so that makes things all the more awkward. Anyway...Gah. I'm so bored. You have no idea. Oh oh oh! Wanna know something cool?? I got a free pass to see The Village next Thursday! It's good for two, and I need a date. Go ahead and fight for it. You know you wanna.   Ewww. I just got the Fanta song stuck in my head. That seems to happen a lot. Surprisingly, it doesn't make me want to buy a Fanta. Hmmm...That's a sign of some really bad marketing. "Don't you wanna...Fanta?" "Mmm hmm."   Mmmm...Dr. Pepper....   Moving on...to what, I don't know. But we're moving. And Moving is always, well most of the time, good.   In other news, Mark needs a boyfriend. PS, I'm Mark.   In a related story, well not really closely related, Ashley never called me back when she said she was going to. Not gonna lie, I'm pissed. Grrr. I'm putting on my angry face now. :-($)   To wrap it up...fuck it. I don't need to wrap it up.
