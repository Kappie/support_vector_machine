For those who don't know Brent and I work at a little store known as Algoma Orchards. Our job entails putting up with the stupid, and incompetent shoppers, who delight each and every moment at work with their idiocy. Well its the summer, so now I have a little more time on my hands. Aside from music, I love to draw so I have decided to release some of our wonderful stresses onto paper, to share with the viewers. "Episode 1: Do You Sell Apples?" should be ready by the end of this week, and all those who are interested can come take a peek right here on this Blog. Until Next Time, Good morning, good evening, and good night. Signing off: Ghostmanon3rd
