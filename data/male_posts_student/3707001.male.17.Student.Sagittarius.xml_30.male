[12:14:07 PM] Matt (8) My : i dont care anymore, b mad at me    [12:14:12 PM] Mangy: fine     [12:14:28 PM] Mangy: listen... u can have ada too... im finished    OK, I wasn't gonna stay mad forever. Eventually I woulda given up this "grudge" and tried to get it how it was before. I said you had the worst of it rite now, Matt, cuz I hadn't heard the apology yet and I was still mad. I was eventually gonna say it was ok, and that I understood ur situation.  But u called me a jerk...  So who wants to be friends wit a jerk? I'm not sure if I would want to. I didn't think any of u were jerks for doing what u did cuz I assumed it was cuz you didn't wanna hurt me. But apparently I'm a jerk. Fine... so be it. Matt, I'm a jerk for being upset that someone I trusted didn't tell me what was going on. I'm a jerk cuz I didn't talk to you for a few days. I'm a jerk cuz u msged me on msn and I didn't respond cuz I was on sc (notice the status). I didn't wanna end these friendships, but if I'm the jerk... then you won't have to speak to jerks anymore.  I'm not into getting in between friends either. So Will, Ada, you don't have to choose between friends, I'll decide for you. Will, I will miss you when you go to school in September. Ada, I will always love you.  There, now it's over...
