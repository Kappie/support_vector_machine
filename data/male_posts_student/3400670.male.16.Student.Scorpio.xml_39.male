       
      So this is the first time that I have posted, but I have seen some of the comments that have been posted and I just hope that we will be able to focus on reviewing for the AP test and not just for the time period that we are studying at the moment. But... actually, I do have a question for chapter 27. Does anyone know why Third World countries are called ''Third World"? I was just curious, so hopefully someone can help.
