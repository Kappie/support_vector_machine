Why in the world would you be bring yourself to such low of a point as to mock someones religion? Cmon, seriously, If you don't agree with someone's religion, that's great, and none of us are going to  make you change your mind. But once you take it past that certain point, the point where you begin to mock the religion, you have gone too far. I do not know about others, but I take it very personally, and I'd even go as far as to say that The Lord himself takes it was more personally than I.
