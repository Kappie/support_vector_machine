We may have lost the sense of  mythos  in the West today, but we are very familiar with  logos , which is the basis of our society.  Unlike myth,  logos  must related exactly to facts and correspond to external realities if it is to be effective.  It must work efficiently in the mundane world.  We use this logical, discursive reasoning when we have to make things happen, get something done, or persuade other people to adopt a particular course of action.   Logos  is practical.  Unlike myth, which looks back to the beginnings and to the foundations,  logos  forges ahead and tries to find something new: to elaborate on old insights, achieve a greater control over our environment, discover something fresh, and invent something novel.
