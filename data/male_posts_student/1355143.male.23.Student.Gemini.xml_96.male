Now I have the respectful title "Svanlaug Jóhannsdóttir, Viðskiptafrædingur"  The day started at 9 a.m. at the hairdressers. There I spent an hour trying to get my "straighter-that-anything" hair to curl a little.  Then at 11 we met at school to take a photo of the whole graduation group. In the e-mail that the school sent us before it said that the photo was to be taken outside if the weather good but inside if the weather was bad. It was poring rain - but still they decided to take the photo outside and all the beautiful curls I had just spent and hour and 35 euros to make just straightened in a few minutes.....  The ceremony was dead boring.  It was held in the city theater and all the students sat on chairs on stage in front of the audience. Lucky me, in my short skirt, ended up on the front row and spent the next two hours trying to keep my legs together and not show the audience my underwear.  Being so short that I can usually not reach the floor when sitting on a chair this was a hard task and after the two hours ceremony my "keep-legs-together-muscles" were quite sore.   So when the whole thing was over I went home to meet the whole family over coffee and cakes.  My boyfriends family and grandma came as well and this was the first time that the two families and grandmas met.  It was very funny to introduce the two grandmas, I don´t think that I have actually introduced two old women before.   Around 8 p.m. my friends came over and we had a summerly barbecue despite the rain and wind - and as expressed earlier, the party was a blast.  We went down town where I hardly met any of my classmates - my guess is that they all drank to much and passed out way too early.  The whole thing ended at 7 in the morning when my friend spilled tomato-sauce of her fajitas over my white suit!  I started working again in the bank last week and I remind myself every day that I only have to work here for a couple of months. It is a nice bank and the people I work with are great, not to forget the great parties that the bank likes to throw but even though I am learning new things I just know that once I learn to do what I am suppoused to do work will get so routine-like and I will be bored to death!  I shouldn't complain though.  It is a better job than many have and my boss really likes me so I get away with doing almost everything that I want to...... like GOING TO NEW YORK after two weeks !!!!! : )  So if anybody is going to be in the neighborhood of NY from the 25th to the 30th of June, please let me know so that we can meet up.  From the 30th of June until to the 4th of July I will be in my friends wedding in Philadelphia.   So, now all I have to do is figure out how to afford this all.  After BCN, Croatia and NY I am going to be pretty broke and I have no idea how I am going to survive without any paycheck from september to january.  All extra jobs pay pretty low..... except for maybe prostitution!!! : ).... so if anyone likes small, soft and dark haired - let me know ;)   Take care,  Svanlaug Jóhannsdóttir, viðskiptafræðingur
