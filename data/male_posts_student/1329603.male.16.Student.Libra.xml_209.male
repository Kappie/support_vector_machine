As a result, don't expect any blogging tomorrow, but I WANT TO BE BACK ON SATURDAY (I have told my Dad specifically to get me back then).  Went into town today, with Lawa. We saw 50 First Dates, which is quite cool and has Adam Sandler in. Much better film than School of Rock. Annoying thing was the screen we were in was almost full, so no getting to talk to Lawa and being all private showing ness. But still, being with her was cool. We got her brother an Easter egg from Woolies, which he will enjoy and Lawa will enjoy stealing. And we went to Starbucks, where I was all non-explorative, getting seulement a hot chocolate. Rah. Nah, but being with Lawa ruled, she still makes me swoon inside. ...Yeah, ok, stop typing now...  Anyway, yeah... *hums Can't Get You Out of My Head* I bought the Radiohead album My Iron Lung on a whim while I was waiting for mum to pick me up from town. Seems a waste of Â£6 when I'm not even that keen on Radiohead, but still... at least if I don't like any of the songs on the album (other than MIL) I can say that my dislike is entirely founded. I dunno, after leaving Lawa it seemed a good thing to do, spend money. Take my mind off the fact that she had to go home... in actuality, despite the fact we talked a lot in Starbucks, I know nowt more now... Oh well. I know enough to swoon.  Yeah, stop being obsessive. Something else... Oh, did no revision today. So, you know, *punches self*. That's 2 days I've missed. Yay. Although good thing is Lent ends today (it does, I promise) so I can eat chocolate again! Yay! Have done already. Lawa and Lisa seem to think Lent ends on Easter Sunday... if it does, then I've cheated but to be honest I was giving up for the period I know as Lent. If I've misjudged the boundary, surely I've kept within the task for myself?  Would like to see Lawa again tomorrow if I could. I know, shut up now...  Quote of the day: "Faith, You're driving me away, You do it every day. You don't mean it, But it hurts like hell."  From Radiohead's   My Iron Lung   Love, Jon Roskilly
