She broke my front and back brakes, but luckily when me and Anthony came over she fixed them, which was cool! We ran the mile today, which I found is really about 2 miles, my time, a sad 18:30, each mile-9:15(times 2). We are writing a really boring essay for Social Studies/English where you have to compare two historical figures, and write a paragraph for each area of comparison. We started "The Quadratic Formula", in Algebra, which really sucks. In case any of you are wondering, I'm in the 8th Grade. Night.  Only 14 1/2 days left!!!
