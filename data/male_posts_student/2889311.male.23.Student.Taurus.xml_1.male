Dilip had told us that his bday was on aug 2nd. I put my detective cap on and casually asked him whether I can see his drivers license and unsuspecting he flipped his wallet and showed me his license and it said his DOB was 7-26-81. The smart actor I'am, I din't show any reaction and said I was just wondering if there was a difference in the manner in which my license and his was laid out. Then I rushed to Prem's home (one of my earlier roomies) to let him know that we ought to do something about this. Then Prem in his usual style got things quickly done and everything was in place, the cakes were ready, the candles were glowing and folks had gathered to wish him.    Everything was kept as a suspense to Dilip. To culminate all the suspense Prem played a neat little trick, he ran down and informed me and thick babu (one of my frnz who returned from India after a vaction jus today) that everything was ready and he knocked the restroom's door and told Dilip that Rajesh (prem's roomie) had broken his leg and we need to rush him to a hospital. Me and thick scampered to Prem's home. Dilip followed us quickly and when he opened the door, the lights were turned on and his petrified face was greeted with loud cries of "happy bday to you".    After the usual ceremony of blowing the candles, singing the bday song, and distributing the goodies, the action started and people enthusiastically grabbed dilip and flung him in air thrice. Somebody was intent on birthday bums but I put my foot down and said no, I hate that painful ordeal. The champagne was uncorked and hell broke out. Everybody in the vicinity was dragged and pushed into the swimming pool, I made a rather graceful dive (did I say I plunged into 4 feet he he!!) and stayed in the water watching the fun as other people got their deal. Thick sounding rather stupid asked one guy be thrown into 6 1/2 feet deep water and the poor guy din't know how to swim and after a few anxious moments he was dragged to safety.    Then we all got down to beer and movie. We were watching Panchatantiram, a Kamal starrer and a stand out comedy. After a few gulps and bursting laughter people faded away and I don't know when I went unconcious and I woke up in the midst of emptied beer bottles and left over snacks, a yucky feeling but the good time we had yesterday made me get over it as I cleared up the mess and got back to business.
