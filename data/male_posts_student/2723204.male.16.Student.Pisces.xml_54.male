For one to achieve intellectual greatness, one has to understand the fundamentals of epistemology. The religious would say it comes from God. But to me, that's no different from saying that rice comes from the padi and not focus on the sowing, harvesting treshing etc. of the crop to produce rice.  Where does knowledge come from? God (in a very broad sense)? While I do not deny that, but that alone is not enough to explain the manufacture of information, it only acknowledge its source. Galileo was a devout christian but the church kept him in his place by saying the very same thing. Intellect can never be kept in a box to feed some pre-modern determinist fallacy. To me, unless christians fully grasp the scientific method, we are simply cavemen trying to understand and argue with and about modern science, no matter how competent we may be.  The problem is in our attitude. The first word which turned my stomach is the phrase "this conclusive argument". No respectable scientist would ever put that in his paper or thesis. Arguments are never meant to be conclusive nor final, arguments are meant to be accompanied by counter-arguments, and counter-counter arguments etc. Scientific titbits do not impress the scientific community without embracing the scientific method. Science is an attitude altogether, not a study, and the scientific method is its backbone.  The second is its disgusting use of rhetoric, exclamation marks are fine if presented in a novel or storybook but never in a scientific paper. The scientific method does not entail rhetoric, only religion does. Too much shouting, and saying that "it is still amazing why evolutionists are still....!" with an exclmation mark, saying that how ludicrous evolution is. Yea yea, you said it in the last paragraph already, so just shut up and present your arguments in a more objective fashion. Ultimately, positivism is the best doctrine where scientific pursuits are concerned. Stop preaching, start thinking.  Respected scientists, instead of stamping a "This is the truth" rubber stamp on their theses, put a "This are my observations and deductions, feel free to counter-argue". Its amazing how some of these scientists have much more humility than christians themselves. Well, after all, the most religious isn't always the most moral. Christians have after all, for the past few centuries, burned "witches" at the stake and massacred the muslims. And that previous statement is an example of rhetoric, not presenting the whole truth in an objective light, even though that is the truth.  I don't see how adding scientific titbits to prove the design argument is necessary to prove the existence of God. So ok, the Earth and universe is intricately made. No need to put all that stuff inside that article, go dig up the astronomy or biology books and yea that'll fill you in. Its just simply showing off, like some peacock showing off its feathers, ohhh look, christians like us can be scientific too ! Come on, like I said, science is not a study its a method.   All the theories, especially scientific ones which are very much christian-oriented, gotta be very careful on that. Cos' no, God did not say that the Earth is 4000 years old, some guy called James Ussher did, and the church did. So don't really believe that, cos' the church has been proved wrong many many times, don't believe me? Just dig up the history books, and I don't forsee any "exceptions" in the near future. The church has been proven wrong because of its stubborness and pride, its pride to tradition and pre-modern scientific authority. Only the scientific method can save the church from this intellectual quagmire.   The best way to argue is to counter-argue and to counter-counter argue. Christians gotta learn to say "ok, you got me stumped this time, good job, I admit defeat for now, but lemme go think about it, and I'll come up with a satisfactory counter-argument." And if nothing satisfactory can be come out of it, then its time to admit defeat rethink our interpretation of the bible, its not selling-out. Any respectable scientist could do that. Even though those before the 20th century had a very hard time doing it, quite stubborn people, but still great attitudes really.
