Philly'll probably loose to Tampa Bay...and I'm saying that from a neutral point of veiw. The Lightning have had their best season pretty much ever, and they'll probably win the Stanley Cup outright.   Anyone who wants to play badminton on Sunday should call me sometime between now and then. Oh, and seems like another of Jack's plans has fallen through. Ben M isn't going for some reason or another. Aparently.
