To start it off, me and my brother Lj had to go to the doctor to get him a physical. we were left there by our daddy since he had to go to work. I must also inform you all that this hospital is in van nuys. Only a few miles from our house. Well afterward we decided to stop beeing fat ( he didn't like how much they weighed him as ) so we set out to find a place to eat....walking. I know i make it sound bad but I happen to like walking. Several restaurants passed us by beore we reached the taco bell I was dreaming of. It had been months since I've eaten taco bell food. I had this disgustingly delicious quesadilla and some hard shell tacos. What made it even better was that i won a free taco! So just when I thought things couldn't get better, Lj decides to give me a tour of cleveland ( my future High School ). I was a lil amased at how small the school was in comparison w/ what i had in mind. It was still awesome though. When that was over it was time to head home. On the ay things started to get pretty quiet ( between me and Lj ) so I told him a few stories of the hyjinx I've been through w/ my friends, I pointed out where a few of my friends lived, and told him who's going to what school. It was kewl just to be able to reminice on those things. We arrived home, and to my surprise, I wasn't tired! *shock shock* . When we got there there was a guy who was cleaning the carpet. HOORAY ........... CLEAN CARPET!. It might not be AS kewl as the other stuff, but none the less, still one of today's highlights. Well the fun didn't stop there. Yesterday I had rented  "007 agent under fire". I love this game.  Though until today I had been stuck on a hard ass level. Who wants to guess what happened. That's right....I got passed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only that, but I won the entire game!!! I even went on to get more bonuses for the multiplayer mode! I've already told you about the last part ( N64 :-D ) There was a lil crap in between.... but I won't get into it for the sake of not ruining my mood.  Well .... I'll be back tomorrow hopefully with more happy news. L8R!
