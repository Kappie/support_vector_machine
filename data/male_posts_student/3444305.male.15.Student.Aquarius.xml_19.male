The night before I found out my brother sleep talked. He went "What!? What!?" and it kinda freaked me out lol. Then I don't know if this was a dream or not, but I thought he got out of bed, went somewhere, and then came back and touched my bed and me to see if someone was there, then he just got back in bed. I don't know if he was sleep walking, or I was dreaming. I don't know. It was wierd. But then I woke up and I didn't feel tired, but like out of it, but not tired! I went to school, and we did something awesome in APS. I loved it. We got to play some polotics. I was republican as you should know if you actually read my journal. If you don't, well that's your problem! But, we got to vote and pass laws. And we had the majority, so we killed almost all of the democrats laws, and debated about them. You would think this was borning as most people do, but I live for this stuff. I love it, I know I'm a loser, but I'm a cool loser! :-D But that was awesome in APS. Then Tara Adams gave me and Bree a ride home, so thank you for that Tara! Then, I got home and cooked myself french toast, and an omlet. It was good, my sister asked me if I wanted to go over to Peoria with her, but I said I would just stay home alone. So I did, and did nothing for a long long time. For dinner I made myself another omlet which was better than the one before. It was good. Then, I just did nothing again. But then at 8:00, the wonderful, specatcular, awesome, hotty, Brian came over. And we talked and I attempted to ride his skate board but it didn't work. And then the wonderful Amanda called me and told me to go to the park with Brian. So we went, and her and the awesome Natilie was there. And then the cool person Whitney came. And yes I am using adjectives just because I'm bored writing this and it makes me laugh. But we talked, and played in the sand, and talked more, and then Brian left, and then we played in the sand more. And then we thought people were spying on us. Well we thought it was people who particular don't like me, but it turned out to me random wierd people when we caught them. I think one sophmore, and a few younger freshman. It was wierd. But then, we decided we would walk to my lover Andrew's house. We stayed and talked to him for awhile, because he is just that cool. And then me and Natelie called it a night and walked home, while Amanda and Whitney sayed with Andrew to talk. Well this is where I am now. I hated walking home in the dark alone, it always freaks me out. But I saw a humgo, yes humgo, plain. It was big. And it was flying really really low. It was wierd, but at this time I was running home because I thought someone was chasing me, which I usually do feel like when I'm walking home in the dark alone. That would be freaky if someone was actually chasing me. Ah that sends shivers down my spine. Well I'm gonna call it a night early tonight; because I need to get some sleep for I'm not dead for school. Have a great night!
