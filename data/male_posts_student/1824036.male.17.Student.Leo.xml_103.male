I dont know what the heck everyone thinks, but they think that they can just take me and push me around and whatever. I feel as though I went from being at my most liked state, at the pinnacle of my social ladder (so to speak), and I guess that I just fell off the ladder.... I dont know how to explain it....  Everyone just decided to hate me, I have no classes with any of my friends, so I pretty much keep to myself. The only class that I have with any of my "friends" is band. And I dont even like band anymore. Playing the trumpet is gettin really really REALLY old! Hence me taking upt he guitar. I am also in a few classes that I could probably do without. Like US History with Milewski; why in the blue heck do we have to do a current event every friday? and compare it? EVERY FRIDAY!  My second trimester schedule: 1. Mythology (I sit by pot smokers and drinkers) 2. Math (farely good to me....nobody I really hate) 3. Language 10 B (I sit next to a kid who failed last year, and by about 3 ppl I really hate) (Lunch) 4. Spanish 2 (nobody I hate....Cassie is nice to me at least) 5. Band (already talked about it) 6. U.S. History (I dont like this class....too many pot smokers) 7. Chemistry (pretty good class...makes me think and I like the class I guess)  There you have it. My very boring month in a nutshell....  P.S. -- My depression is going away too...for a while
