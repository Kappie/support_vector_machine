I got the O.K. from my boss at the hospital. There is an opening near by. I'm not on lease here so I put in my notice tomorrow and start moving in 2 days. I'm only livin with Mal temp until I can find a place.   I decided to buy a new car. I want an 04 escalade. My cousin wants to buy the truck I have now. Everything is working out now.
