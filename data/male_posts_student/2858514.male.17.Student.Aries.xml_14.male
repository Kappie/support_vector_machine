Anyway, this typhoon isn't very strong, I hope nobody would get hurt under this typhoon.      By the way, I finally understand quicksort. I can explain every step of quicksort now. This algorithm in fact is very easy, the code iseasyto write, and have a high efficiency. The next step is to read through the algorithm and implementation again, to get a more thorough understanding.      Next month is a critical time for me. The release of HKCEE result has a great affection to me as it is going to determine whether I can study F. 6 and where will I study. I hope everything will be fine and I can have a wonderful life with my friends in STMGSS.
