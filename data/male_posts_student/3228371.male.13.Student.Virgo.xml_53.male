So hard. Complications. Blah. *sighzZ* So... weird? Can't think properly right now. Paranoidness? I don't know. Just those occassional feelings of uncertainty, probably. Some regarding "cough". Don't know if he noticed that she was walking home behind him. Oh well... she always ends up close to him. Don't like it. Oh well. Nothing I can do. Whatever's happened has happened. Can't do shit about it.   Stuff... on my mind. Talked to certain people about it. I was gonna talk to Alice about it 'cos she seemed like a good person to turn to but will she tell Nima? They're best friends and all... iunno. Got some responses from certain people... I dunno. I'll see.
