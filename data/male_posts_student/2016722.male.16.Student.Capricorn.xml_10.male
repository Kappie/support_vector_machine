Not that this isn't common knowledge but we thought about 90% want attention and possibly the 10% really are different. Oh whoops, I don't think saying "different" is PC. It would be interesting to talk to somebody who was actually gay without them being all in your face about it. Meaning its a natural thing to them so they're cool with talking about it. I would imagine it would be hard to talk to anybody about it though. Especially in today's society with it being such a big issue, everybody's afraid of "finding out". But no, you don't "find out". It seems if someone was really gay, they'd know from whenever a romantic notion first appeared inside their mind.   Blogs like mine are different. Meaning... I'm the only one who reads it. Bastards.  Oh I just remembered. Bobby Fisher hates  urlLink Jews . What a nut. He invented his own version of chess where you can't plan out your beginning cause there's lots of different ways of starting. Fischer Random Chess. At least get a good name for it, Bobby.
