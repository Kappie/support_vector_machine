In total this week I've done a 19 mile walk, camped overnight in a small tent made for 4, fitting 11...had no sleep, Went paintballing...twice,Made an egg racing cart thing, went to a talk on the internet (nothing I didn't know already, of course :)] and organised a primary school sportsday... Blimey. 'Twas all quite fun though! And I have a startling discovery: SOMEONE ACTUALLY READS THIS! Yeah...I was shocked aswell..but CFB ( a guy I know on a Forum) actually reads this...well he read it once, which is better than I thought.Anyways, tis my birthday in all but 2 days now...Having a "Party" tomorrow...yet none of my friends are gonna be there, busy and the like. Nevermind...that's what comes of organising your party 2 days before the event...I need to get more organised, methinks. Ordered one or two things for my birthday...magnets weird bouncy balls...keyrings (I collect them) and the stuffs. Going to PC World *SHUDDER* later to buy a few games stuffs. Also I may  order some new Ranma 1/2 books later, really addictive they are. Anyway, tomorrow afternoon can't be all that bad...it's gonna be in the Trocadero, which for those of you who don't know, is a big fat arcade with cool shops and a rollercoaster thing. Should be good. Anyway. Bye.
