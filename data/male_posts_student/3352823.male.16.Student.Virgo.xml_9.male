And off I walked, in the sweltering heat to the dentist. Got there, the door was locked. I figured that maybe they don't open 'till three or something. So I waited in the hallway. And waited. Eventually my Mum comes up in the car, and says they're closed 'till Wednesday due to a death. She rang them up to say that she'd pay for the thing there, and got an answering machine message instead. Oh well. But now... It's gonna be drawn out and prolonged into this huge event. Ack. We're gonna get a new dentist though... Whee. School was great today. History was a riot; but some of the kids are getting pissed with me and my one liners. Even I am. I just so rabunctius in that class. I can't help it. The day was made even sweeter when we had no Biology! We had this presentation from this police officer about drunk driving. It was good I suppose. The guy have the biggest feet and the smallest ears! Just a contrast... Haha. Then in English we practiced the scene we're acting from Othello, which was cool I suppose sans the people who weren't doing it right. Haha. Then Business sucked cause of the freakingly ubsurb stuff we're doing in it. It'll all Math... The same stuff I did last semester, and FAILED! It was only sweetened due to my leaving at 2:30. Huzzah! I started to write Episode 2! But.. Yeah. I'm debating whether I should rewrite Episode 1 and make it script form. I can't write novels anymore. I used to be able to... But I lost that flame. I don't know what I'll do next year in Writer's Craft. If I make it in script form (i.e. like a movie/TV script) it'll be AWESOME with camera angles and all.. But none of the character development stuff... But if I keep it as it is then I'll kind it harder to write, but there will be development. Get me? Leave comments and tell me what you think.  That's all for now folks.
