But the car is refusing to depart in silence.    As the movie star "Herbie" retires, it has become obvious that its heritage will remain vibrant.   The Beetle has achieved an unbelievable cult status across the world, not least because its creation marked the launch of what has since become the largest car company in Europe.   "It was the first product they ever made," said Sanford C. Bernstein's European car analyst, Stephen Cheetham.   "It was the only car Volkswagen made for ages."    Reliance    In fact, although VW made a range of larger vehicles during the 1950s and 1960s, the Beetle was only replaced in the early 1970s.    And not before time.   "Like all companies that discover a money-making machine, they were loath to let the Beetle go," said Jay Nagley, a consultant at Spyder Automotive.   The Beetle was hugely popular in Germany during the 1950s. And when its popularity at home began to fade during the 1960s, it was taken on by the Flower Power generation in the United States.   But by the end of the decade, VW's reliance on the Beetle was bearing heavily on the car maker, Mr Nagley explained.    Golf    VW desperately needed another "people's car", a car for the masses.   And in 1974 it found one, when the Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro came to the rescue with the somewhat boxy Golf.   Mr Giugiaro's company Ital Design sold the design to VW, and the golf has been Volkswagen's flagship model ever since, Mr Cheetham said.   "Until a few years ago, VW was effectively the Golf Motor Company," said Mr Nagley.    Tough competition    The Golf has defined the market for mass-produced hatchback cars and has firmly established itself as the leader of the pack in this segment.   Not a bad move, given that this is, in the words of Mr Cheetham, "typically the most profitable segment for car makers".   Recently, Ford's Focus and Opel's or Vauxhall's Astra have seriously challenged the Golf's hegemony. But the German is about to hit back with its fifth generation Golf, due to go on sale next year.   Traditionally, the Golf has managed to stay ahead due to its "unique position as an upmarket massmarket car", said Mr Nagley.    Diversified    But the Golf is no longer everything to VW Group.   In recent years, VW's dependence on one model has been sharply reduced.   As a consequence, new problems have emerged.   "VW as a group now has too many models, and too many overlapping models at that," insisted Mr Nagley, pointing out that VW owns Audi, Skoda and Seat in addition to Volkswagen.   And it owns the somewhat more luxurious brands Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini.   Clearly, Volkswagen Group has grown well beyond its origins as the maker of Adolf Hitler's "people's car".   But in the process, the car maker seems to have lost its way, many observers argue.   Even its New Beetle is pooh-poohed by analysts.   "The New Beetle is, I would argue, an awful thing," said Mr Cheetham.   VW's finances have suffered too; on Friday the group reported that its profits have fallen sharply during spring.   VW's operating profits fell to 616m euros ($709m;�436m) during the April to June quarter from 1.4bn euros ($1.6bn; �991m) a year earlier. Pre-tax profits fell 46% to 679m euros.
