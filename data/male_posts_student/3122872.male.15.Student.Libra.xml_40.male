After an hour of work, I've got about 20 seconds of bugger all... that's the bad news, the good news is that I've got a storyline, and I can now work on it properly...      Jamie is soooo lucky he can just do his randomly coloured background, I actually have to make my own in Photoshop, which can be a pain in the neck when the damn computer freezes every 2 seconds, even you open something like ****ing notepad...      I'm moving into rant now aren't I...      Btw Jamie, you can help me with this... How badly will having 1Gb of RAM cripple a Chinese version of Win 98?      until next time...
