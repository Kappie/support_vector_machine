All I need is a big ass, industrial size fan that blows shit off the walls and ill be fine.  I dont have a good lead in for the next character profile, so lets just get to it.  The eighth greatest character in Comic Book History:   Eric Magnus Lensherr AKA Magneto   Racism is, unfortunately, one of the most base and consistent human emotions. It is also and one of the most difficult to recognize and curtail. Leaders can inspire hope, and give people something to believe in. Leaders can also use that power to infuse a sadistic, corruptive influence on good people who just want a chance for a better life. Magneto is the best example of Man's inhumanity towards Man and the inherent quality of people to forget what has happened to them in life.  The most interesting qualities of Magnus' personality comes from his Judasesque association with Professor Xavier. Divergence in political theories can cause the best of friends to become the most dire of enemies. Thinking Xavier has become complacent and, pardon the phrase, Uncle Tom-ish in his approach to the strife between the Human and Mutant population, Magneto seeks a pre-emptive policy. None the less Magneto does not, in his heart, want to harm people. He merely has his priorities, as skewed as they are. Much like Malcolm X during the birth of the civil rights movement, Erik has little regard for the people he says as corrupt and despotic. In turn he seeks to transplant the pain of this life and wants to experience the level of control he feels others have, yet he lacks over his own life. A man who can control the most powerful natural force on the planet as simple as a piece of paper was powerless to save his child from a mob in post World War II Ukraine, and this inability to control his own destiny is galling to his sense of self.  This brings up the ironic part of Magneto's nature. For a man who was raised in the Concentration Camps of Auschwitz to preach the moral and spiritual superiority of his "Perfect Race", is somewhat fucked up. One would hope that Racism and irrational hatred of people would be a lost part of that generations emotional repertoire, but alas it is not. The contradictions of character loom long and deep in Magneto's life. Walking the line between shadow and light, Magnus did not always subscribe to the hatred and war- mongering he is most identified with. For a time, He was the head of the Xavier Institute and helped the Third Generation of mutants to pass through its halls come of age. Coincidentally, upon graduation these students became a militant, pro-active strike force under the leadership of Cable. Perhaps it was the underlying, seething resentment and desire for control in Magnetos voice and personality that gave the New Mutants that particular spin on "The Dream". In the end Magneto is undeniably human, and that is what makes him such an effective villain. With little provocation, you could become this man. And that is a frightening thought.
