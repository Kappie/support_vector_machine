Basically due to the kind of atmosphere and design process, the learning style would be one-on-one, which means the student would be able to emphasize his own needs, therefore stating it into a student-centered learning, and at the same time the student would be able to pace in his own speed, and he dosen't need to adjust anymore to the irregular pace of the classroom. The students would be able to provide the learnings and knowledge on lessons that they like to learn with, not some courses that they find appealingless to them. The lessons to them will have application due to the exercises, simulations and quizzes given to them. The system would be able to adjust itself to the learning style of the student. Learning would be essential on the part of the learner since he would be able to track his learning due to the save/load feature, and therefore follow his improvements. The learner is also encouraged here to think on his own ideas too, and the computer will be the one to adjust to him.
