One of the most important tasks of Transhumanism is the pursuit of Life Extension and eventual immortality, since aging and death represents are two of the most immediate hinders for total self-transformation and personal freedom. Overcoming death is also a social and psychological problem, since most of human culture is based on the assumption of the eventual death of every person. A final argument for the pursuit of Life Extension and Cryonics is that many of the visions of Transhumanism will probably not be possible within our (unaugumented) lifetimes." -Anders Transhumanism Page  "Red Mars" touches on this concept.  It doesn't deal with it in the Transhuman context directly.  So living forever sounds good, but it has some unintended consequences.  Even without trying too, most people who read this can expect to live well into their 80's, and by 2060 or 2070, does it seem impossible that people would be living to be 100?  Doesn't that mean those people were born in the  1960's and 1970's !   Rambling... I'll post more thoughts later.
