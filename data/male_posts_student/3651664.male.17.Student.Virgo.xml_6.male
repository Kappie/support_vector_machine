Kerry also pledged to never privatize Social Security, cut retirement benefits, or raise the retirement age. So basically, his plan is to screw over young Americans and kill the innovation of new medicines. Young people who pay money every month into Social Security will never see that money again because the seniors are using it up so rapidly. But who cares? They're just the future of America. The old ones that are about to die are  much  more important. And importing cheap Canadian medicine? The medicine from Canada is only cheap because the Socialistic Canadian government aritificially holds down the price. This means that the companies that create the drugs don't get compensated enough for the 15-year process they go through to bring a new drug to market, so they don't have enough money to turn around and invent new medicines. Let in Canadian medicine, and the prescription drug industry will go down the tubes.
