The three great presidents have three things in common: All faced unprecedented challenges, all responded to them boldly, and all ultimately were successful. Mr. Bush so far meets two of these criteria: History dealt him an unprecedented challenge in the form of the 9/11 attacks, and no one can deny that he answered it with boldness. If he is able to overcome the current troubles in Iraq, and if he succeeds in his mission of combating Islamist terror by promoting democracy in the Middle East, history will be far kinder to him than are his contemporary critics." --BY JAMES TARANTO  Mr. Taranto at the WSJ makes a good point that many scholars have not been addressing. It will be interesting to see 30 years from now, how the textbooks and history view Bush. If Iraq's security improves (it is slowly but surely currently) and a true Democratic governent is setup, he could become one of the "best presidents". I truely believe that. By the end of presidency, Bush would have started to change the face of the Middle East, get the economy back on track after 9/11 and recession, set a solid plan of countering terrorism. President Bush has also faced unprecedented, bitter, partisan hatred during his term (leaving some to say that he was "controvercial").  The importance of his presidency ranks up there with FDR, Kennedy, LBJ, Reagan. Like FDR, Bush had to lead the country in a straight moral path after 9/11 and face reality. Like Kennedy and Reagan, who had to face communism and the Soviet Union, now the enemy that must be wiped out are terrorist cells...
