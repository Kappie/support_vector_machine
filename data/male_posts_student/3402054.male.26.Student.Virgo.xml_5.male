This morning, I decided I did not want to buy any more fast food, and I took a small risk.  I plugged in the machine, pulled a burger patty out of my freezer, and slapped it down on the grill.  I was certain nothing could be so foolproof, let alone Hollando-proof.  How wrong I was!  Three grilled meals later, I am in full pseudo-Atkins mode, with nothing but meat, cheese, and spinach salads in my immediate future.  I say "pseudo-Atkins" because I have no idea what constitutes an acceptable meal plan under the late doctor's regimen.  Like the majority of other shoppers, I flip packages around to see which products have the fewest carbohydrates.  I hope to do some research on the South Beach Diet after the Bar Exam.  For now, though, this quaint little gadget is saving me from spending the same time, more money, and far more patience in the pursuit of not-so-fast food.  Some would say it's healthier, too.  Here is something my friends never thought I would say: "Do you have any recipe ideas?"  Well, do you?  Let me know...
