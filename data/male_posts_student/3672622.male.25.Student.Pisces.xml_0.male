I assume she has no feelings other than friendship feelings towards me, but I am having a hard time getting through to my heart to let him know.  I have been trying my damnedest to not call her, so the lesson is when you have feelings just ignore them.  It hurts to ignore something that feels right in your heart, but what are you supposed to do.  Keep being around a person and put your heart through rigorous torture. I'll pass, I can't handle this heartbreak.  Off that subject, my grandmother is in the hospital because she is having vertigo attacks.  She loses her balance and then is pretty much paralyzed from the loss of balance.  I write her a letter every week and I have since I have been in college, because I know she gets lonely in Dallas by herself.  She has a shrine of me on her walls.  I used to go home with her after school every other day when my mom had to go back to work.  I learned to cook and she told me stories after stories.  I love my grandmother, but she won't be here until the end of time.  Life hurts, always.
