I'd say more but I'm still not quite clear on what's going on down there in Louisiana; I'd recommend just following that previous link.  In other news, good ol'  urlLink Moqtada al-Sadr  has vowed to fight the U.S. troops to the bitter end, and told his Mahdi Army to go on and resist even if he dies. There's a few different perspectives on this in the media, and Aljazeera has  urlLink one of the more colorful pieces  as usual. The Guardian has written up  urlLink a good brief  on all the latest developments over there in Iraq, and AFP has  urlLink more details  regarding the situation on the ground.  EDIT: The Sydney Morning Herald has a pretty cool biography of two unique fighters in the Mahdi Army.  urlLink See for yourself .  Posting has been slow lately, but we're hanging in there. I blame the unseasonably cold weather here.. it slows down the blood.
