Seriously, I mean isn't everyone's goal to finish High school and go to college right now? I really don't know what I want to do with my life right now.  I now that one day, if I ever can find the right girl, (which probably wont be for a long long time)I will get married, and start a family, and be a nice guy, and a good citizen. But thats all that I have planned for now.  How am I supposed to know what I am supposed to do with my life!!!!! I am only a freshman in high school!  Anyways..........  At least I have the Choir Banquet to look forward to......I guess it will be fun, but yet again it just brings up the fact that I don't have a girlfriend! Right now I really actually don't want a girlfriend, but for some reasons I kinda do. I know that they are a pain and everything, but I really wish I had someone that I could always hang out with and talk to.  Many people say that I should just talk to all of my friends, but to tell you the truth, Sometimes all of my friends act like real jerks.  Im not talking about all of my friends, all of the time, but I just get pissed because I don't necessarily have a "Best Friend."  I know that I am pretty popular, and that I am kinda lucky because I have "A lot" of friends, but ALOT OF FRIENDS isn't necessarily better than a couple really good friends..............  Anyways..... I have procrastinated enough already, I really need to get back to (or........Ahem Start...) MY OUTLINE!   Please tell me what you think, I would appreciate it.    And I apologize if you hated the fact that you just read this whole thing, and all that I have been doing is rambling on and on.... Lol  ~Eric
