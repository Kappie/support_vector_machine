I still hold the position that social activity requiring physical movement of any sort is massively overrated, unneccessary, and also redundant. However, I did get a couple of laughs, and more importantly, I made my first journey that was potentially more than a mile in distance by driving a car. Yes, be afraid America, for I never listened during driver's ed, I cannot see very well in general, and I am ASIAN. Although I have yet to  urlLink break laws of physics  I am confident that my driving can break ANY rule. And yes, now that I'm driving and visiting people outside of my house, the universe is two steps closer to ending. Don't worry though...I'm still staying far, far away from guitar and surfing...
