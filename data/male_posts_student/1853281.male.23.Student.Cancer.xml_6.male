I am, however, blessed with a mother who is willing to take me to jordan, where Papa meets us(he cannot really drive in the city anymore,bad for his heart.) I feel bad, but i hate going there, i hate seeing how old he is getting, how feeble, how resigned to death. Saturday i am going with him to his first ex-wive's house for dinner. Two of my hal-sisters will be there with their children. One sister i have not seen in like three years, same with her two boys. The other i have not seen since i was six, so like 16 years or so. I have never met her daughter and son. I am not really looking forward to it. I tried so damn hard for years to try and get to know them, to try and be a part of their lives, etc. etc. but was contsantly rebuffed. I have no desire to even try anymore, too much time has gone by, and they never thought of me as family anyways.  It should be an interesting encounter.  God i hope there is some wine with dinner cheers
