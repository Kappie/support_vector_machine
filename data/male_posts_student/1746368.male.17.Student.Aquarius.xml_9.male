She has been one of my very good friends since 7th grade, and we have gotten very close over the past year. This will affect me a lot. I have a lot of friends that I look up to and she is one of them.   Also today I talked with a friend that I haven't talked to in a while. She and I were in a 3rd-4th grade combination class when I was in third and she in fourth. I just found out that at that time we were both loners, and would've gotten along well.   Wow, first day, pretty good for school at least (that is, besides knowing about Jessica). My first period class (Tech Assistant), is going to be probably one of my favorite classes this year. I am so far the only PC tech they have. I was pretty muched raised using a PC, so I kind of know what to do, for the most part. Alec (my teacher) says that I pretty much need common sense to be in this class. For those of you who know me, well you be the judge of how much CS I have.   Second class of the day--Web Page Design. Half of the websites to the left (the ones under links, not the diaries) are mine. If you took a look at those, you would see right away that I am probably not going to have to much problems with that. Although, we are using a different kind of program than I normally use (in fact, we are doing something that I downright hate; I think it's ok to hate an inanimate object). We are using something called by many as "What you see, is what you get". Basically, it is whatever you put on the page, and you see put, is what is going to happen. I cannot stand that method. I think it is stupid in general. Granted, for people who are just beginning web-page design. I use the coding method, that may take longer, but it is more rewarding at the end. Just to know that you did this yourself and you had a big hand in the outcome, instead of a program doing it for you. Like I said, this is a class that's going to be easy, and the teacher wont know if I used it or not.  Third period (or block for you Granada folks)--US History. This class is the only competition for my favorite class. The teacher is one of my favorite teachers. The only problem is, techincally it won't be real competition until December or January. Mr. Wood is on millitary leave until then. The subsitute teacher said that she doesn't think that he even knows he's teaching this class (he normally teaches Geography and a class called AVID).  Fourth (although it wasn't really in this order; it went 1, 2, 3, 5/Lunch\6, 7, 4, 8...this was so that people who didn't take an 8th or a 4th could leave at the normal time) was my hardest class of all time. I had to walk all the way to Wienershnitzel and get a large fry and a large soda, than walk all the way back and eat it on campus. Man that was hard. Okay, it wasn't really hard. I was being sarcastic for those people who didn't catch it. I have a free period that time, and it was actually during the normal time I eat lunch. Since I'm a junior now, my parents are letting me leave campus.   5th class--Geometry. Man, I keep spelling this word wrong, I am going to need to permanetly infuse it in my brain. Geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry. Okay, I think I got it, I am going to put it in the middle of a sentence all of a--geometry--sudden. Dang! I still spelt it wrong. Gemoetry, that's how I keep spelling it. Oh well, hopefully I wont have to spell it that often. I must be slydexic. Anyways, this class should be fine.  Lunch--I failed this one last year. Actually, did you know that in some countries they actually give you a grade for this one. I'm not sure how it works, but it's either they grade you on how nutrionally you eat, or how much you socialize...not sure which.  6th period--English. Not much to say here, teacher is pretty cool, although he cusses, which is not something I like (in case you really know me).  7th--open.  8th--Biology. Not going to be that hard. It will have its ups and downs. The work is something I enjoy doing, well at least today. I like taking words apart and learning what different suffixes mean. Maybe, I can get so good at it, that I will just know what the word means before I have even heard it before. Work is easy, but it's often. Every class day we will have homework.  Well, my day was not going to well. Until I talked with Dominique on the phone. We talked about how are days went, and that was wonderful. I really like her guys. (S), you know it. If you didn't get that, you weren't supposed to. Goodnight everyone. Have good school days. Make good education. Get good job. Impruve splling, ad grmrmaar. Learn 2+2 does not equal Fish, no matter how many times you did it. If you are taking U.S. History, learn that if you answer everything George Washington, you can at least get an "A". Actually, don't do that, it probably won't work.
