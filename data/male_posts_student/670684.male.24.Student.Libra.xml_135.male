Like I said before, if Saddam Hussein came to America and said he wasn't interested in controlling our country...that he just wanted regime change, and if I didn't fight I wouldn't be hurt, I'd fight.  I'd protect America.  So how come our government didn't expect Iraqis to do the same?  Are we that vain?  The Pentagon chastized Al-Jazeera for showing pictures of dead coalition troops.  USA Today showed pictures of dead Iraqi fighters on its front page on Friday.  Today, USA Today points out that  urlLink those living in the Middle East don't buy into Operation Iraqi Freedom .  Unfortunately, it's obvious there's no going back now.  All I can hope is that the Democratic Party pulls its head out of the donkey's ass and comes up with any semblance of a platform that will beat George Bush.  Then, we go to work repairing all of the shit Bush and his cronies fucked up during his term.  And if you don't think Bush has fucked up, look at the economy and ask the world what they think.  PERSPECTIVE.    NOT WAR - Every once in a while I get down on my writing.  I am a hard-lined, deterministic writer who is hypercritical of his work.  And I've been stuck at the same point in my screenplay for two months.  The screenplay wasn't reading like I wanted, and my themes were weak.  I was questioning writing, something I do semi-often...how am I good enough to pursue this as a career?  But today was glory for writing.  I watched some Final Four basketball (Texas' win should inspire an essay about the personal crisis I have every time Texas plays sports), then went to Borders and wrote for five hours.  Maybe not great stuff, but I moved on from where I was.  It probably won't be what I end up with, but I'm past the hurdle.  Small victories.  Grand feelings.
