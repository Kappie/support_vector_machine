(a) telling someone how you feel about em and maybe looking stupid or (b) telling someone how you really feel about em and having a chance at making your friendship/romance better or more meaningful not to mention saying what you feel to someone when you feel it......i cant tell you how much ive tried to keep that in mind, that if you have something to say to someone you should say it and not hold it in......mistakes of the past, im trying not to repeat.....but its alot harder than it sounds, because that fear of rejection is always there scaring the hell out of us......but more than anything else, we have to remember that all of us are trying to do things with good intentions....few of us are actually trying to hurt each other or make each other feel weird...but anyway, what im trying to say in my long convoluted way is that dont be afraid to take a chance and show someone how much you care.......if they reciprocate then great, you made just made a friend into a really good friend....if they dont, oh well...it doesnt mean ya'll cant be friends or still hang out....its just that person wants to keep your friendship at a distance....and thats not a bad thing necessarily..everyone in the world isnt gonna be your best friend.....but think about this, everyone likes to feel good, and if you express to someone that you really care for em (be it your friend or love interest) they will certainly feel good about it.....and if they dont feel the same way and you look/feel foolish then so what ? wasnt it worth it to make someone else feel good ?   like the chili peppers said, show love with no remorse.......
