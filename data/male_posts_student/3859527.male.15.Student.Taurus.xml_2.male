It was cool, I felt important, looking through the government's Hansards and pulling things out from it; making phone calls to the Provincial Nominee Program Office; photocopying and other clerical tasks; and overall just being in front of a computer with something useful to do!  Well, I helped a few people, talked to them about the Nominee Program (which is the most popular question that is asked at the office) and that made me feel accomplished.  I booked some appointments, confirmed a booking for the office, and again, more clerical tasks.  I don't know why, but I feel that I belong in an office.  Let's just hope that it doesn't win me over from my dream of teaching, which I highly doubt it will.  Tomorrow, is day 2, let's hope it's even more eventful.
