Is it necessary to call the cops on kids with furniture.  I think whats funniest tho is how two cops showed up, one in a car and one on a motorcycle.  Like what would we do?  Try to attack them which chairs?  At this time, i would like you all to give a round of applause to the citizens of moraga and their outstanding police department
