The outcome of that dumb descision: I've been suffering with a stuffy nose, sneezing, aching, coughing, etc. all day long. ARGH and to make things worse I had to endure sawdust, smell of spray paint and various other things while making my bio project tonight with Underhill at my place. UGH.....not exactly the best day of my life, actually today was probably one of the less happier days for me. However....with the bad comes the good also.....as finally I have pretty much secured a spot for gr. 11 physics and dropped gr. 11 accounting =).  It's 11:42pm right now, I'm sick, huddled under a blanket in front of my comp, so my blog's gonna be brief today:  -Woke up with a scratchy throat, thinking I may be sick -School -History test......totally winged it....but it was WWII so it was all jokes =P Easy stuff -Civics: Note on politics....started debate assignment -Lunch: Jasper's....throat feels a bit better after lunch -Math: Got 86% on trig test -Guidance appointment: Secured spot almost in physics for next year -Programming: Made 007 animation a bit more... -Stage band X: New song......My Funny Valentine or sometin like that....easy piece -Got a ride to Masonville to pick up project materials -Underhill came over and we finished most of project up -Built Rollin' Colon and Rectal Rangers, and Tooth booth (I'll post pics tomorrow....HILARIOUS) -Typing up bio portfolio -SLEEP!  Yup....that was the main outline of my day *sneeze...cough cough.....gasps for breath.* And I'm still pretty sick....so off I go to sleep now! Cya!
