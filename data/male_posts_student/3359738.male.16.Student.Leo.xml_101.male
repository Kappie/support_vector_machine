I can imagine the conversations kids from this town have with foreigners when they go on vacation... 1: Why hello there cute child, where do you come from? 2: Hi. I'm from Fucking Austria. 1: Watch your language, young one! 2: I said Fucking Austria. Fucking..Austria.... OK!? 1: No need to be so rude. 2: *growl*
