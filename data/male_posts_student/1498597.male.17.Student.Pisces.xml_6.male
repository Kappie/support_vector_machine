Changes!   1)  We have a logo picture, we just need to crop and paste it on the blog page!  2)   JR and myself  have taken some pictures for our mood after each blog. We must now put them on the site. Look for that by at least next Tuesday!  That is about it for now! Check either of our  personal blogs  to find out more information!   For the morning shift, this is  Nick  signing off! Stay tuned.
