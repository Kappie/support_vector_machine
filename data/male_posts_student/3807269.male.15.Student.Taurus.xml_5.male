This is my day:  Wake up Shower Eat Watch Saved By the Bell Go onto computer Watch court shows on TV Go back onto computer watch more TV go to sleep  Of course that is not exactly what I do but still you can tell how bored I am!   I got my friend a Gmail account today.  I really had to talk him into it but I got him one from eBay. It was very cheap but when the auction was done he gave me the money via Paypal and I paid the seller. A few minutes later I logged into my Paypal account only to find out that Paypal charged me $0.35 to get the money from my friend! You would think that they would charge you when you pay somebody but I guess not. It just came to me that I remember signing up for the premiere account that you had to pay fees for. I am a so dumb!   I have 2 feedback on my new eBay account!  After one year of eBaying on my sister's eBay account we only accumulated a 4 feedback. Yesterday I created a eBay account and bought two Gmail accounts and now have a 2 feedback within a couple of days. Of course anybody could do this but the two feedback only cost me $1.26 CDN plus those stupid Paypal fees which I talked about in the above paragraph.   My friend just got a old computer.  It is a P-3 which has a 8 giga-byte hard drive. We plan to turn it into a web, FTP, and mail server. I really want to try out Mandrake Linux 10.0 so I downloaded the three ISOs and burned them to CDs.  I got to go to my friends house now to install that stuff. Have a good one! -Sean
