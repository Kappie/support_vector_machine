Y'see, at first I tried to communicate via the most obvious route available to me: I called the phone number in the phonebook. Which of course directed me to the "Boys  Girls Club." No one there could help me, but they told me to call in the morning, at around eight o'clock.  So I did. I asked for... whoever the woman of the previous evening had directed me to. I can't remember her name. In any case, she directs me to the Rotary Club of Saint John. Twitch.  And I get an answering machine. Apparently Heather Peterson is in Halifax on business. Well, that's all well and good. I leave her a message. The next day, I don't get a call. The day after that, I don't get a call.  So, I decide to call the Rotary Club again. But, having expected her to call me back, I didn't write down the number. As thus, I call up the Boys  Girls Club again. But, again, I have to call up at eight o'clock to get the number. I do so. I call the number given. Answering machine, only this time it tells me she's in Halifax on business. She'll be back on August 16. My frustration grows.  So I don't leave her another message so as to be a nuisance. She'll surely get the message when she returns. But she doesn't call on the sixteenth. Nor the seventeenth. Nor the eighteenth. On the nineteenth, I complain openly to my parents. And they have an obvious reason: she must have one of the answering machines that deletes messages after a week. So now I'm just pretty fucking mad.  It is right now the twentieth. I have once again been forwarded through the Boys  Girls Club, and I called up the Rotary Club, only to discover Heather Peterson's answering machine waiting for me once again. (Fortunately, the note on Halifax has been removed, so I'm okay.) I leave a message. Two minutes later, I leave another with my phone number. (It took great mental strain to sound kind and polite when I have developed a rather potent hatred for this elusive woman. To slip up might be tolerable.) I am now going to explore other methods of communication with Rotary. E-mail? Smoke signals? Driving up to Saint John and yelling at people a lot?  My Thai is progressing pretty well I think. I'm 1% fluent! I'm also trying to learn a lot about Thai history, politics, and culture, and I'm trying to get my wimpy Western taste buds ready for an onslaught of spice. Current training: very spicy Colombian food prepared by Suzanna. I'm handling it pretty well.  As an aside, my trip to Iceland looks relatively impossible. I won't be helped by any organization for this one, so airfare will be a hassle.
