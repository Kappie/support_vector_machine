I don't give a damn if I topped my miserable class or what, but personally, it's not even a freakin distinction, not to mention A1. I'm so freakin disappointed with myself...like what the heck was I doing?! How the hell did this happen?! Why the fuck did I only get 11/20 for my zao ju?! Argh, what the hell have i been revising!? And two bloody wrong words in my compo. ONE mark gone just like that, with that one mark, I could have at least gotta a bloody A. Maybe it's just me not putting in enough effort...but damn am I disappointed. It's all about me, and there's nothing anyone can do to help now. I'm so damn disappointed, and it's like the only time i've ever cried over my results in Sec4...while other people might be celebrating after the release of the O lvl chinese results today. 69, ARGH.
