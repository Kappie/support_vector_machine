Holy crap the stuff I've missed. Example: Friends Finale tonight.....it was the first time I watched the show and the last time as it being an actual functioning show. Talk about ironic huh =P. Thing is though I actually enjoyed the last episode, whichw as surprising since I never really even regarded it as a "show....in my list of TV shows at least. It's kinda interesting how one's perspective can change over a course of an hour of watching a show. Other than that though....today was also day 1 of recovering from the last two days where I have been a bit sick, and also today I wrote my english exam essay thing; wonder how that turned out =S.  My day started off in the morning at 7:30am. Reluctant to get up since the night before I spent most of my time on MSN and looking at random websites, I was pretty tired when I woke up. Nevertheless I still got out, sick as I was, and walked downstairs for a quick breakfast, and then headed out the door after a quick morning routine.  While on the way to school, chatted with Patrick, and finished my tea to wake me up in the morning. I can understand now why some people need tea or coffee to wake them up in the morning. I'm becoming one of those too lol. Anyways got to school pretty quickly, and got out and headed for the school.  Music class........not very exciting. We had some sub teacher today that came from Russia and taught at Pearson for a while. Mrs. Wharton and Mr. Clark are out in NYC right now, so yeh the music department's pretty much abandoned for now. Our class worked on our solos for the first half, while our sub, Mrs. Veiner or something on the lines of that worked with Mr. Clark's class. So my class spread out over many rooms and started to practice a bit, preparing our solos for June. I sight read the songs that I have to play keys for *Kelsey and Niki so far* and also practiced my piece for a bit, that has now changed since I bought a book at Belle Air. After a while though I got bored, and started reviewing my Grade 8 piano pieces on the piano. Who cares about my trombone piece.....it sucks and plus I changed it anyways. So therefore.....be productive by attempting to memorize the few songs you have in your head ready for the future exam. Amy played a few pieces then, and then we talked a bit about piano. Apparently she's CC too I think and not RCM. Meh anyways before much else happened....headed back to the other room for some repetoire and then left class for science...  Chatted in the halls with Niki and BW and some other people for a bit, and then me and Niki headed up to science class. Today: Ergh we did some stupid assignment of labeling an ecosystem. I handed in the assignment due for the other day and then began working on today's work. Pretty lame stuff....finished it in about 30 minutes and then chatted for a bit with Dylan and Boughton and some other people. Nominated Boughton for student council....*shrug* that's something different today I guess. Student parliament has started elections so I see. Anyways though....bell rang....all those thoughts just jumped out of my head and off I went to study for english exam.  While in the library, chatted with Brescia, made a few more notes, and then ran over them. Didn't really do much at lunch. I starved =P. Yay the feeling of emtpiness in your stomach.  Bio class now. Since 16 people were missing....NO LAB! Whoo! Instead we watched two boring videos *shudder* where I slept for one and watched the other since it was actually somewhat action packed *GASP.* Bio class was pretty short, and Robert read over some of my notes as he didn't make any. So meh whatever thought might as well give him a bit of a chance. Lilian was set for the exam too, and so when the bell rang......dun dun dun.....  English: summarized....I wrote my exam. I was 2nd last person to hand it in. I think I failed =P.  After school I went to Belle air to pick up music, then home. While going home though, I stopped by the new Pizza Hut where Western donuts used to be. SWEET 2 BUCKS A SLICE OF PIZZA! I may not even have to go out for lunch anymore =P. So grabbed a slice, then walked home.....ugh backpack feels heavier and heavier in the warm weather.  Anyways......after school watched some TV, homework, then caught the last episode of friends. Yeah that was pretty much my day I'm zippin' by it really....gotta shower and sleep hehe.  Cya.
