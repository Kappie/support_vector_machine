I really wish me and a person could talk more often than we do! cause i mean no matter what happens between us i dont wanna lose our friendship! i mean thats important to me if before ne thing else between us! Like all me and her really do ne more is talk on the internet and thats very rarely too and when we see each other in person whether its jus a hey or its nothing at all most of the time! and i would really like to change that! Like today she thot i was mad at her cause i didn't say hey to her before lunch! but idk really why i didn't say hey tho! i guess its cause Austin was near me and i know she doesn't like Austin so i didn't think she would say ne thing bak ne way! I would jus like to really change things! I jus dont want us to end up not even being friends after all we have been thru together! which is ALOT of prob. that we fixed each other from! Like i jus dont want us to not even act like the other isn't jus standing right there like ignoring the other at all costs! but i also want the trust bak too! Trust makes up a friendship! but ne wayz off that subject yall r prob. sick of it! hmm tomm i have to leave before 7 to get at the school at 7 to retake a freakin lap rules test ahh!! i hate this! and Kayla passed hers wit a 97 i think she said! jeez! and Drew actually out scored me and josh! can u believe that crap? lol! hmm well i MIGHT post again later before bed ttyl! ALLOW GOD INTO YOUR HEARTS!!! L8erz Brent
