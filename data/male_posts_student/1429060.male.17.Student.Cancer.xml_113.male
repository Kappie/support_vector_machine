I remember nothing of the trip back to Memphis for I was asleep for the entire thing, or hovering in that nether region between total unconsciousness and semi-awakeness.  The second purpose of this litle trip to Jackson was my birthday celebration with my grandparents. Mi abuelita made me a vanilla bean cake spread with reaspberry/white chocolate icing. Horrible for one's health, I'm sure, but utterly delicious. I also recieved a book explaining the biological impact of nurture on the 30,000 gene sequences in the human body, as well as a Pixies CD (Trompe Le Monde). Holla. I can see why Alanna dies over Frank Black.  What else is occurring? I am to tutor early in the morn and recieve moneys, so that shall be salubrious. And I recieved SAT II's scores today. Math II was a 770 out of 800, which is somewhat depressing since that places me in the 83rd percentile. Seriously, everyone passes the Math II. Also, I recieved a 790 in Molecular Biology (that'll look positive on the transcript) and an 800 in Writing (who would have believed that?).  Gone. Cheers.
