I never thought I'd get this far this quick with those stupid notecards...I have 19 when I came home with 6 today. When I woke up this morning I had 0 done. Major cool  "Get on with it now!" Okok...here it is. rEcAp:  Math: I barely got done with my assignment in class, and problem 15 is kinda wierd. God I hate problem 9 or whatever it is...stupid airplane/wind angles and crap. Why don't we just leave those things to the computers that fly the jets 80% of the time anyway.  Science: Finish-my-math-and-do-science-assignment-while-not-watching-bacteria-video-hour.  Band: Same old stuff.  **Concert announcements** April 4th: The Random has a concert at Central Park at 2:00 in the afternoon. This does conflict with Chops drill camp, I believe.  April 13th: JAZZ COFFEEHOUSE!!! Its going to be awesome...so much jazz...lol. People need to absolutely pack the place.  April 20th (whoa, you have 3 concerts within 2 and a half weeks?! yes, we do): The MSA spring concert band concert, meaning the wind band, concert band, and wind ensemble.  Senior graduation: We played last year, and we're playing again. Same piece: Sine Nomine, one of my favorite band pieces...  On with the recap: Spanish: Not a whole lot of funnies from today, as we took a test today. Should be a few Friday, as it will be block day.  English: Random English Funny (wtf is going on here? a funny for every class?? no...just the classes that Matt Moris is in...lol): We had a substitute today (btw, Substitute is a good song by The Who). Mrs. Schenck to be precise. This allowed Matt to get away with saying "penis" instead of "present" during roll call. again. he is too good at that I swear!  Social: CE test today, which I got 57/60 on. not bad at all, considering I don't study much at all these days. I'm a crammer.  *this concludes the recap*  I added many cool new things to my profile today, such as more lyrics (don't I have enough of these already?! no.), an updated "self portrait in words", and a certain deterrant of sorts...  WE NEED CHAPERONES FOR THE LOCK-IN!!!!!!! NOW!!!!! We need one for 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, 1 for 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, and 1 for 2:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Please notify Sam, Carly, Pat, Jamie, Mikesh, or me within 24 hours of this posting. PLEASE.  I get so sick of hearing "20 dead in suicide bombing in...", "nearly 200 killed in train bombing...", "Building blown up, many expected dead..." these days. It makes me so damn sick to think about it. Every day, our soldiers are dying, citizens around the world are dying. People in SPAIN are dying because of terrorism, because of radical religious beliefs, because of the instability of international relations, because of our DUMBASS PRESIDENT!!!! *whew, got that out* Anyway, I feel like protesting because I'm sick of violence, of the whole "War in Iraq" and "Operation Iraqi Freedom" bull.  So here's a protest song to wrap it all up: "While digesting Reader's Digest In the back of a dirty book store, A plastic flag, with gum on the back, Fell out on the floor. Well, I picked it up and I ran outside Slapped on my window shield, And if I could see old Betsy Ross I tell her how good I feel.  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. They're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more.  Well, I went to the bank this morning And the cashier he said to me, ";If you join the Christmas club We'll give you ten of them flags for free."; Well, I didn't mess around a bit I took her up on what he said. And I stuck them stickers all over my car And one on my wife's forehead.  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. They're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more.  Well, I got my window shield so filled With flags I couldn't see. So, I ran the car upside a curb And right into a tree. By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead. And I'll never understand why the man Standing in the Pearly Gates said...  But your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more. We're already overcrowded From your dirty little war. Now Jesus don't like killin' No matter what the reason's for, And your flag decal won't get you Into Heaven any more."
