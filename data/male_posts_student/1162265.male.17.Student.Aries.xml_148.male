In this entry he comes to terms with his reasons for writting.  He has recently got into a fight with his parents about him dropping out his senior year, and he's moving out.  December 31, 1999  	Holy shit.  It’s Y2K, another fucking conspiracy to throw people into a panic so more black people can get lynched in Louisiana or some other fucking farm state.  Me, I’ve almost completely moved out.  This is the last entry I’m writing stuck up in this damn house.  I got work starting at Checkers on Monday, and I’ve sold all my shit to give me money to move out ahead of schedule.  I might deal, but that shit doesn’t pull in enough money for the risk, only people who’ll buy second hand shit from me are white kids, and they don’t pay shit.  Why the fuck can’t I live in the BX?  Shit.  At least it could be like that movie “Empire” I’d be one rich vato that way.    	Fuck.  I couldn’t finish all my papers, I’ll just get a damn GED or some shit in May or something…. I’ll study for that shit later. “Education” doesn’t mean shit anyway.   It’s just some bullshit they fill your head with, so the feds can convince you to vote. Bullshit.  I went out with Kaaliyah yesterday, we needed to build up some tolerance for tonight, since I know I’m gonna get fucked at Rahim’s party tonight.    	How much do I wanna bet the pigs are gonna bust that shit?  How much?  And then Kaaliyah, she’s way to serious for a drinking buddy.  She’s a freak when she gets drunk, not like I’m gonna just lay down and fuck with her, because she’s been with like a dozen guys.  It’s just… it’s like all this shit they teach us in school is to put on a mask this proper mask of some fucking European idol of perfection, but it’s all bullshit.  We’re all fucking monster, who only eat, sleep, shit and fuck.  That’s why when people start doing that shit everyone else gets afraid and says “Fucking put back on your fucking mask!”  It’s all for shit.  Seriously.  I’m only gonna get older and die.  This shit is why I made myself a journal… maybe one day I’ll go all Malcolm X and have this autobiography that everyone reads…. I wish.
