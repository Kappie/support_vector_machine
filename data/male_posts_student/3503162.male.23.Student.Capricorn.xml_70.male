Just my luck to just miss the train. I got on the next train, the train of pain.  Man did this train go the all so slow. I got on at around 10:40, got to my station at 1: 45. I kid you not, what was meant to be a 50min trip took over 3 hours. After numerous delays the train reached a point between Homebush and Flemington stations. I thought not another delay, wonder how long this one was going to be. Boy was I off target. We spent over and hour stationary. I thought that nobody else was in my carriage so I started to sing along to my music. Like 20mins later I heard somebody answering their mobile. Oh shit how embarassing, they must had heard my poor karoke skills :/ After an hour or so, people started to all come to my carriage. Mate, when theres no power to the train theres no air-conditioning and boy did some of the people stink bad. So for the next few minutes people were hurling abuse at the train guards and driver. This friggen weirdo came and sat next to me. I was listening to music starting outside the window when I felt somebody touch my hand. I turned around and saw this Indian guy saying stuff in a really low voice. I was like WTF! With the guy blocking the exit to the corridor I had no choice and respond to his weird ass comments. He even started to bang on the front seat saying, "This is no good, not good at all" in his soft voice. How bloody creepy! Luckily he pissed off and they decided to let people off to walk on the tracks. We went in small groups much to the disgust of some commuters.  Some of them were saying, "We arent school kids, we are grownups, what the fuck with the small groups?". Eventually I got off and walked on the tracks to a side gate. This reminded me off an incident during high school when the train was delayed for nearly 2 hrs and had to walk on the tracks to the station, Homebush. Wonder if this is a co-incidence. Needless to say I arrived at school bloody late, like after lunch time! Anyways everybody had to wait on the street for the bus. If you watched the news today you might had seen footage of it. Another great-mix with the bus drivers given the wrong route so the buses to get us were delayed. Not everybody got on the bus so another buy was supposed to come in 5mins time. It came like 20mins later. Being a seasoned veteran of crappy public transport I diddn't lose my patience just yet. When we got to Lidcombe station, I just missed the train as I was on top of the stairs. Not happy Jan! Got a seafood box from the tuck-shop at the station. I think the seafood box gave me pretty bad food poisioning.  Anyways I got Doom 3 from EB when I got home. Bloody crashes on my computer after 5mins. Just great!
