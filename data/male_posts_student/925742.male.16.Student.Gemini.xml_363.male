What else.... oh right, I've been workin' out and doing lapsin the pool, too, so I get enough workouts in.  Sonja, Ryan, Jess, Eleanor, and Lucy are all here, its nice.  But jesus, they can nit pick and fight, makes me sad.  It also makes me sad when all I can think about is you *ahem, you know*, and how much I already miss seeing you and talking to you. Hmmmm.  Its a crazy idea.. maybe I could get you to come down here some time.  Nah, thats crazy.  What else, I've been playing sooo much nes, its not funny.  In fact, after I was hammered, I had a huge discussion with my sisters and the guys about old nes games, hahahha.  We talked about how my cousin Godart was an nes freak (the dutch equivalent of your brother, haha, I'll tell you about that later...)  Yeah I got totally hammered last night, like 5 daquiris and 3 winesand 2 beers.  Woooooo.  I was just thinking bout those 6 signs of love.... ehehehhe.  More on that later... maybe.    Still thinking of you, maybe I should call?  Thats a good idea.  This next one's to pants: we should get 'hordes of underdark' and play nwn again, that would kick ass.  you know.. when i'm not so *whaaapsssh*  ok, later, maybe another post sometime.
