It was a link to fedoranews.org  For those who came in late, Fedora is a Linux distribution which is extremely popular. Its like the Windoze of the Linux world( though some won't agree) [without the bugs of course!]  The article was about FC3, the next release of Fedora series. And they mentioned my name in that  urlLink  article.         "The Fedora Core 3 outlook    Now's the time to think about Fedora Core 3 ................(it goes on)        Ankit Malik  started a   Fedora Core 3 Wishlist   thread, which grew relatively large........................ "
