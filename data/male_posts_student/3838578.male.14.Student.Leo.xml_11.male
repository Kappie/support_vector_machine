We have parents invade. I don't want to name names so let's call the parents Snit1 and Snit2.  So we start out on a small field with no nets, we are warming up with the balls, like our coach always tells us to. Snit1 comes over and gets us doing all of these weird stretches. After that we move to a bigger field, normally this would be a good thing, but not this practice.  You see, we don't always have the best turnout at practices, at this practice there were 5 people, 5 flippin people! What the heck are five people supposed to do on a whole field. Normally it would be no big, but we kicked off a team of 15 to use it. I really don't get our team sometimes.  Then we started a drill, it started out good, but after doing it for forty minutes and only five people, I naturally needed some water, so I went over to the goal posts to get my water bottle, when Snit2 yelled from the sidelines "You shouldn't need water! Why are you getting water?" I naturally wanted to punch Snit2 in the face. But alas, I continued on the practice.   After this drill we did one more followed by a "world cup" drill where we didn't get a break till we were done. By this time I was already feeling sick and not getting a break.   After practice was over, I sat in the car with a plastic bag in my lap because I was so sick from not getting a break. We ran for 1 hour and 30 minutes STRAIGHT!  Now this might not seem as bad as it was but imagine this. Everytime you make a bad kick, lectured. Everytime you miss the goal, humiliated. There was constant pressure from both Snit1 and Snit2. It got to the point where Snit1 came over and TIED MY FLIPPIN SHOE for me! What is this coming to you ask. Well I am just wondering why they couldn't of just left us alone in the first place. We are losing, yes. But do we care in the least, no. We just want to have fun, and now that is impossible. Those two do not belong there and I wish they would just leave us alone. They put way too much tension and pressure on both the team and me as an individual, now I am considering abandoning practices altogether. Heck, I almost cracked a few times on the field.  I hope you now understand what I meant when I said that there was "corruption within the higher ranks of the team"  Anita
