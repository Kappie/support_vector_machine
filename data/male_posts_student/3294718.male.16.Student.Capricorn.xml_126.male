This is reinforced time and time again by Mattson, ranting about how people who wear 'punk' stuff and listen to 'punk' music are not actually PUNK in the literal sense of the word. One cannot simply  become   whatever they want just because they feel like it... they ARE, in actuality, a summation of whatever they HAVE BEEN. Working at becoming punk will turn someone punk. But just ACTING punk doesn't cut it.  Of course, self-image and whatnot play in. But, for real, self-image can be lied to. If they seriously want to, people can deceive themselves. But they cannot fool the makeup of society, the REAL judge. Furthermore, society has the ultimate power in deciding what a person is, much more power than the person himself. The only way self-image becomes more real than society's image of a person is when they are cut off from the latter, which in fact brings up existentialism and whatnot, and that is truly irrelevant to this conversation.  Secondly - people want to be liked. John wants to be liked. I want to be liked. Everyone wants to love and be loved, its just human nature. It's pretty obvious. Therefore, using point one, one wants to present themselves to society in a way such that they are accepted, regardless of self-image. One will shift self-image to fit in, though truly, people want to think of themselves as being individual. One needn't be an indivdual if they can fit the rest of the group. But to think they are their own person, they want to fit in with a group that meshes most with their own individual self-iamge. This allows them not only individualism, or at least a deception thereof, as well as acceptance of the group.  Thirdly - punk isn't complete social rejection. Even punks want to be accepted, even if they are disillusioned with mass society. Their acceptance into society comes from the rejection of society - they WANT to be 'rejected.' In being rejected, they have acheived their 'accepatnce.' They have held their stark individualism and spurned society, which is their individual sense of acceptance, by means of their disillusionment. I hope you get what I'm saying.  Fourthly - 'Pseudopunks' are, in fact, a type of people. They might try to be punk, but, in reality, fail to lie to themselves. More so slackers and rejects, they find others like themselves and want to be accepted to this group. Maybe trying to be 'punk,' but more so trying to fit in. They might not know what 'punk' is, at least, in Mattson's sense of the word. They are NOT individualists. They just dress weird and listen to music because this is their method of accpetance into their group. Furthermore, they get the deception of being actually punk from being socially rejected by mass society, not necessarily their own group. They gain acceptance from the group and retain self-image of individualism by being rejected otherwise. Don't blame these guys more than anyone else - they're just doing their own thing as much as the rest of society.  Myself. Am I punk? I play piano. I go to church. I conform to mostly whatever. So... I'm in tune with adult society. As a teenager, however, I'm totally off the scale. So am I punk? In my own society of teenagers, I'm fairly rejected. So am I punk because I wear my pants around my hips instead of my knees? Or am I just exceptionally mature for my age... ahead of my time?  Furthermore, I do like a bunch of those juniors we play Halo with. As previously stated, everyone craves acceptance, myself in this category more than most of you. It's awfully awkward being the only sophomore in my pre-calculus class of juniors. I know a bunch of those guys in there though, from Halo. It's my wedge that I can work on to gain social acceptance from these people, and thereby make Calc next year that much more enjoyable.  Going on, Mattson has judged many of the class of 2005 quite harshly for hardly knowing them, but that's just him. I'm naturally accepting and trusting of people I don't know - I have prejudices like everyone else, but probably not the utter distrust of nonacquainences that Mattson displays. Beyond this, the class of 2005 comes from infamously affluent families - everyone will admit to it. This places them in a greater seat of social power, money being their means to this. This further spurns Mattson the punk from them, simply because of their social status, prejudging them for their luck of birth. Truly, there are a lot of unsavory juniors, or now seniors, I guess, but the entire class is definately not bad, and tit for tat, is probably better than the retarded class of 2006.  That's all I've to say. And I'm off work at 7 sunday, I might be a bit late, but I'll be there. I'll need directions.
