Do you remember the good ol' days when  B5  was being shown on TV2 (after  The X-Files  and  Time Trax , if memory serves me correctly)? Well, I'm not sure how many of you caught the plot back then, knowing TV2's lack of organisation in screening episodes in the past (and even now, maybe? Dunno. Don't wanna be sued for defamation, though, so I'll leave it at that). The thing is, if you watch  B5  from the first episode of the first season to the final episode of Season 5  in sequence,  you'll be blown away by what an accomplishment that sci-fi series was. Heck, you don't even need to start from Season 1 Ep 1 --  I  didn't; I popped in halfway during  B5 's explosive third season and was immediately hooked.  What's so great about the series?  some of you might ask. Admittedly, it wasn't much to look at -- despite being created in the 90s, some of the graphics were clearly dated and could have been done a shiteload better. But let's glance across that and look at the  plot. Mein Gott,  the plot.   B5  was written primarily by the creator of the series, J. Michael Straczynski, who planned the skeleton of the series' entire plot and subplots to span over a period of four years (it eventually ended up being five when it was renewed for a fifth season). In other words, episode plots were thought out  waaaay  in advance. Something that was mentioned in Season 1 would suddenly happen in Season 4, and when they show you flashbacks to those older episodes that hinted on said event, it's a cause to gasp and go, "Ohhh,  that's  what they meant when they said that!" The mysterious reappearance of the shuttle Babylon 4 during a Season 1 episode had dramatic repercussions for the crew of Babylon 5 during the series' third season. The instances are plenty, but the point here is that for someone to create what is essentially a five-year  miniseries,  it's no easy task. It's downright impressive and enthralling.  So yeah, even if you remember  B5  as something of a visual flop, if you ever get a chance to review the episodes (available now on DVD from your online international shopping website!), give it a go. If you like sci-fi, you'll definitely be blown away. And if you don't, you might still find something of interest in the inherent political symbolisms that constitute the plots of  Babylon 5  -- a topic I shall reserve for another time, as my housemate has just knocked on the door clad in a towel, saying, " B5  in ten minutes, move your ass."  I'm moving.
