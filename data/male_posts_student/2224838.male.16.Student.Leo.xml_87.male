School:  More than eight hours of my day are taken-up by school, so I guess I could say that's what I've been occupying myself with. Here's my scheduleby the wayfollowed by what I am currently doing in the class.   Tuesday/Thursday   AP U.S. History II: Social Studies Performance Demonstration. I chose to argue that journalism of the late 19th and early 20th century had great influence on American politics, foreign policy, and social reform.   English III: Tomorrow I will be taking the state reading assessment.   Spanish: Preparing a Spanish weather forecast that I will present to the class with a partner. Â¡Ay, bendito!     Newspaper: Racing the quick deadlines for the next paper. My article: Barbara Mohney set to retire after 13 years as principal      Wednesday/Friday   Creative Photography II: Panoramic photo sequence.   Seminar: Study and sleep.   Precalculas/Trigonometry: Beginning a chapter on "analytic trigonometry."   Chemistry: Discussing temperature, pressure, and volume.    Monday   All classes   At home:  I've been getting a whole load of brochures and such from colleges ranging from Southern Methodist University to New York University. Just recently I discarded most of the "blah, blah, blah" letters as I went online and requested more information from the schools I'm actually interested in. Other than that, I've been messing around with my camera a bit, reading  The Fountainhead  by Ayn Rand, and basically waiting on spring break to come around. Just a little over a week to go!
