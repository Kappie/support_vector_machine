At mississinewa, if thats how you spell it.  bloody reinactment, didnt get home till 11, took 4 hours to tear down. bloody, um, think of a word for people that go into a store after its officially closed. I dont have one.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
