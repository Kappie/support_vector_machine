Now me and Mattson share the hate for crappy drivers, so I drive really slow down our dirt road to our houses.  I mean, my foot wasn't on the gas.  I am sure Chris and Mattson were cussing up a storm about slow drivers and so on.  I am very surprised he didn't pass me with selected fingers sticking out the windows.  On other news, I called to complain to Tim Houle today.  I was going to explain that I am Jason's friend, our road sucks and so on, and then tell him that he needs to make Jason a man,  you know, 40 lashes each night, or pull- ups while reciting the Bible.  But I only got his answering machine, and when he called back, I completly forgot about that part.  I am now sad that I am the worst Halo player.  But happy that I beat Chris the last time we played.
