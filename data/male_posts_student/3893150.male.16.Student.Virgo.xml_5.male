I like watching movies, playing frisbee, hanging out with pals and the occasional pinner. as far as movies go, I'm a big Quentin Tarantino fan. love all his stuff. I like the LOTR series, Trainspotting, Kevin Smith's stuff, The Godfather: Part 2 and The Goonies. music..favorite bands are the Misfits, Queen, Talking Heads, The Clash, Alexisonfire, Dropkick Murphys, Gwar and Radiohead. that it? I think so.  that should be ok for now. I'll update again when somethign interesting happens.
