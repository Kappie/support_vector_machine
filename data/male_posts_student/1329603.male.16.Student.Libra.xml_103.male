I'm actually doing really well on my minimalist piece for GCSE. Not that I've done a lot on it today, the majority of the work was last night. But it's sounding quite authenticly minimalist. But, as with everything I do, there is a real downside; it sounds slightly too much like the work of Steve Reich, who in terms of minimalism is my inspiration. But oh well, hopefully it will be deemed different enough to get a good mark. I've got a 5-4 bar in it ^_^.  My hair's actually quite long again now, as if I hadn't noticed. It's getting there, folks, it's getting there.  Aw, though. Laura told me not to wear my hat all the time. I like my hat. It's cool and Welsh. Well, actually, it's from Bristol, but that can be our secret. Yes, ours, so that's the around 4 people that read this (which makes me sound really smug, but if I say 2 then the other 2 complain) and mine. So, funfun.  Anyway, I'll endeavour to repost later, at the moment, I'm off to get lunch. Ciao!  Love, Jon Roskilly
