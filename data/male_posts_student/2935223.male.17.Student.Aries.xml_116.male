I was dead asleep when my mom knocked loudly on the door this morning, and then I quickly got up and put on the first clothes I could find and sprinted out the door. *********************** I dislike being up this early, I really do.  'Cause now I have a very long time until people wake up, and then I become less bored.  I don't know how many people are goin' to be willing to hang out with me today however....after last night.  But, I'm not gonna get on that, because I'm just gonna forget about it.  oh..that's just great. nevermind.  I'm gonna go take a shower and mow the lawn now.  Good-Bye.
