All thoughts contain only revenge, Revenge to those who were foolish. Feeling anger towards fools... Anger towards fools who look away and ignore me, Who wouldn't let me have a chance to make them see. Anger towards fools who think they are superior than me, When in the end we are all made of equality... Flaws may be different but they are still flaws. Perfections may not be the same but they are still of equal strength. If only these stupid fools would only see, What it is like when they hurt people like me. Then I wouldn't have to bear such malice... Such hatred towards them... Only then will I not have to bear such anger at all.
