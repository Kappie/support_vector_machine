The entire thought process of your past, present, and future is predetermined, that it is planned that it is always been planned.  *shivers* Creepy, neh?  Well for the first time in my life I am able to see it play out   And, I am to assume that as with all great tales there is a place to start, a beginning, so to follow this tend I assume to start there.  Eric a.k.a Sunshine is a good friend of mine, who lives to dance and have fun invited me to Salem’s Homecoming Dance.  Well, to fate’s divine plan Eric lost my ticket to his cousin who in turn gives it to her boyfriend.  Eric informs Will at 6:00ish, a mere hour before the dance. *sighs* Will’s heart is a little tattered. *sighs* Alas at around 8:00ish this 32 year old man aim’s me and talks to me and then gives me this one boy’s screen name.  I talk to this mass cutie and discover that we have similar interests and he speaks German (I do as well)! So, it seems that somehow I was to miss the dance to talk to this great individual.  Morality?  I never thought that missing a dance could have purpose or meaning but it did, and I am not one to normally agree, but there is no way around this. ~Will
