I can see myself changing very slowly from a girl who stand up for herself and forgiving and patient to otherwise.  Firstly i became very negative about almost everything.. I judged people alot from first impressions and worst i stick to my opinions. I think badly abt other ppl and i have lots of comments.... of course i wouldnt say it out loud but still the thought is there... and i hate it....  Theres one girl in the ward where i work.. wont reveal names.. i seriously dont like the way she look.. i mean i dont like the way she dress and the way she carry herself.. i mean its like NONE OF MY BUSINESS... but still i kept myself away from her and til today i havent exchange greets or words.. it was merely as simple as " i know that u exist" then her bf's dad was my patient. and her bf and her were there... the bf kept asking me stupid questions which HELLO! U have a nurse gf!!!! and then i started not liking the guy just because i dont like the girl.... CRAP isnt it????? And i get very interested when others talk abt her... whtther good or bad remarks....  Next is my 5 month pregnant colleague.. Karen's the name. She is this bossy and dominering kind of person who would never admits to her own mistakes. I should give her the benefit of the doubt that shes pregnant and cranky.. but still i chose to take her remarks personally and then worse i complain abt her to others. and i didnt care if she got to know abt it.... coz everything is true.  I make fun of people and participate in trash talks abt them.... its totally lame of me..  Suddently i become this very negative person and very unlikable one too....and the jealous type... Why did i become like this... am i satisfied with whatever i have???  Im very sure this is not the person i would want to become and i promise i would pray and change myself for the better...  I want to be patient and caring and aproachable. i want to be satisfied with whatever i have and at the same time driven abt life and competitive with whatever im doing...
