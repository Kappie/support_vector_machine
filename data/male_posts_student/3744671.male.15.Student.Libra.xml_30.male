I love this thing, it gives you a ton of info, very helpful info I might add, about the industry, where it's been, where it is, and where it will be in the future!  They have stuff on all different fields whether it be sound design, character creation, level design, etc!  Definitely a HIGH recommendation, especialyl if you're looking to get into the industry! Amazing book!   You can buy it urlLink  here for US  and  urlLink here for Canada   The only bad thing about this book, especialyl the one on Amazon's Canadian web site is the steep price point, but still a worthwhile investment!      ------------------ ~Thanks, Brian M
