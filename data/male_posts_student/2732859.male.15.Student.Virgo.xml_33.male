I think that this is a great move by Kerry.  Edwards will help Kerry in parts of the South and in other rural areas where Kerry would otherwise be weak.  Kerry and Edwards have a very good chance of winning the election and I would put my money on them right now.  Swing voters tend to go to the challenger and Kerry is either winning or tied with Bush in almost all of the polls.  It looks very good for Kerry right now and I think that we will have a Democratic Administration a year from today.  Just remember, Don't stop thinking about tomorrow!
