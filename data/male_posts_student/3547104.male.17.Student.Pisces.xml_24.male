I'm sorry I let my fans down. *tear* Oh well.... alot has happened, but I'm not gonna write every single detail... sooo here's a recap of what's gone down in my life:     Def. got went to a few art galleries and got wasted this past Friday night with Seyma, Katie C. and some other people. Let's just say that black pumps, and Cher have taken on a whole new meaning for those that were there.    A certain someone arrived from a trip earlier than I had expected and that just like, made my year. I cannot wait to spend some  tiempo con el.      NEWS FLASH: Spiedie fest sucks. ["MOM! TIE DYE SHIRTS FOR $15!!!" ... "STOP IT OR I'LL MAKE YOU SLEEP IN THE CAR!!!"]    Corey from PA rocks my world. "TIFFANY? WTF IS TIFFANY?!"     Went to Mass. for a family reunion. Tons of family drama. The Torres clan puts the dys- in dysfunctional. (But Rob's family puts the FUN in dysfunctional!)    I have an ASHOLE fetish. ;-)     Loose is afraid of party snapper things.     I shall never question Emily's driving abilites while she's sober. "BUT YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING!!"    "We're housekeepers. We are the keeper of houses."    "OMG! WE HAVE FOUND THE SECRET!!!!!!!!!" (Oh how I love my Italiana Pimpcess!)     Those are pretty much the highlights of the past few weeks... I'm sure I'm missing a ton, but w/e, you have your own lives to worry about (at least I hope so.) Well, I am now going to bed... I'm very tired... but before I go, I must give a shout out from the heart, TO DONNA MAE: DONNA MAE, YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS, THE REASON WHY I GET UP EVERY MORNING... YOU MAKE ME WANNA BE A BETTER PERSON, AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A MAN... I THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN AND DONE FOR ME. I LOVE YOU DONNA MAE!!!!!!!!    This new version won't let me publish my usual signature... so I had to come up with a new one. Here it is:    Corazon Nate       However far away, I will always... :o)
