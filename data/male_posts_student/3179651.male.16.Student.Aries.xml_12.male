My mom tells me its because I sleep in late on weekends, catching up all the sleep I've missed. BS. Didn't sleep last night either. Took some homeopathic shit the rents bought it didn't work, I actually felt more awake. I think I basically passed out around one something, but woke up at 2:30 and then again around 4...My doctor probably wont put me on anything next time I see him either, and the rents wont buy Nytol or nyquil of anything... I'm so grumpy at school, sorry... If I'm bitching at you its just because less than four hours of sleep two nights in a row makes me pissed as hell.
