Given this possibility, it is worth asking what might happen to the prosecution of the War on Terrorism in a Kerry administration.  There are reasons to think that it would falter.         A vigorous Kerry continuation of the War on Terrorism is unlikely due to the recent history of the Democratic Party.  The old Democratic Party of Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy no longer exists.  During their administrations the Democratic Party was the interventionist party in the United States.  Then Democrats favored an assertive foreign policy, and they were willing to use military force to overthrow dictatorships and spread democracy.  However, the Vietnam War dramatically changed the philosophy and direction of the Democratic Party.  Democrats, bearing primary responsibility for the war, banished the interventionists who were perceived to be responsible for our involvement in Vietnam.  This allowed the party to be taken over by pacifistic isolationists, and they have controlled the Democratic Party ever since.          Senator Kerry's personal history reflects the history of his party.  He served with distinction in combat during the Vietnam War.  In spite of his wartime record, in 1970 he joined a radical leftwing pacifist organization, Vietnam Veterans  against the War.  The extremism of this organization is demonstrated both by numbers (it had only 7000 members out of a potential pool of 9,000,000 Vietnam era veterans) and by behavior.  As a member, Kerry generically accused American soldiers in Vietnam of routinely committing atrocities against civilians, without citing specific evidence or specific incidents.  He participated in antiwar demonstrations with Jane Fonda, who continues to be the American most hated by current active duty military personnel.          In his career in the Senate Kerry has continued to demonstrate pacifist anti-military tendencies.  In the early 1990s Kerry was accused by journalists of suppressing evidence that the North Vietnamese government continued to imprison American soldiers after the end of the Vietnam War.  He has consistently voted against technological upgrades and new weapons systems for our military.  Therefore, it is likely that President Kerry would have difficulty as commander-in-chief because, like Clinton, he would never have the respect of those in uniform.         Based on his record as a left wing extremist and as the most liberal member of the Senate, it is likely that Kerry would do the following if he were elected president.  In a Kerry administration, American military forces would be committed abroad only under the United Nations banner.  The problems with this approach are multiple.  The United Nations is a Tower of Babel, and it can only take effective action when the United States leads by example, not when we pretend to simply be one of many.  The United Nations serves as a public relations front for the world's remaining dictatorships, such as China, who disguise their genocidal activities and pretend to be civilized nations.  Furthermore, France and Russia use their Security Council vetoes to stifle effective counter-terrorism actions in order to disguise their own agendas, which include selling nuclear technology to terrorism-sponsoring countries like Iran.         And, given his rhetoric over the last two years, Kerry would be unlikely to renew the Patriot Act, in spite of voting for it as a senator. Instead, he would deprive law enforcement and intelligence officials of the tools they need in the exceedingly difficult task of monitoring, pursuing, and convicting terrorists.  Kerry would not support the proactive Bush doctrine of preemptively pursuing and interdicting terrorists before they attack.  He is likely to reduce our troop commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he is unlikely to militarily intervene in any additional terrorism-sponsoring countries.  Kerry is likely to return to the reactive and appeasing policies of the Clinton administration.  He would wait for a terrorist attack to occur and then he would respond symbolically and ineffectively, similar to Clinton's cruise missile response to the 1998 embassy bombings.  Kerry would likely return to a carrots-only policy to get North Korea and Iran to dismantle their nuclear weapons programs, based on the incredibly na√Øve assumption that dictators will be good if we are good to them.         The most horrifying reality confronting the civilized world right now is the possibility that terrorist groups can acquire or manufacture weapons of mass destruction.  All other issues are insignificant by comparison.  Consequently we can never return to a reactive counter-terrorism policy.  Democrats, still assuaging their Vietnam-induced guilt, cannot be trusted to proactively prosecute the War on Terrorism. Whatever other virtues Senator Kerry may have, his inherent pacifism and predictable reactivity to terrorist threats makes him unqualified to be a wartime president.
