I logged off at 9 to watch Digimon and meow at my breakfast. Hmmm. At 10, I came online, because they are showing the Pokemon Special, which I watched already.  Anyway, what a surprise! Janet called and told me all the cats are at RSS already (except Janet, me, WQ and CQ). AHHH! CQ said he will go with his family...so I am meeting WQ at 11.30. Very extremely rushing!  At the 913 busstop, I saw KentKent and we decided to go to meet WQ. Okie...we met WQ, who was rushing to catch the 962 bus. Heh Heh. I read my book in the bus. How meowful! When we are approaching the school, we can see it's very busy! Surprise surprise! (OH OH!! Parent Trap is showing! My favorite movie of all times!!)  Hmmm. It was quite crowded, yes. Very. We went to find SL and gang in the canteen. Hmm. Me and WQ went to walk around. Honestly speaking, I wasn't really awed by what I saw. Nothing really excites me. Well, 'cept for the Huanted House. Nobody wants to go in there, so didn't go in the end lor.   Janet and YC came, and all of us decided to walk around to spend our coupons. Hmm. There wasn't much to spend on. Hmm. Me and WQ went to the canteen. We brought drinks (watermelon juice, which is very little) for $3. Then, WQ brought two chicken wings and we found a table to eat. They were so piping hot WQ couldn't hold them for long. OOO!   SL and PY joined us after a short while. Hmm. I brought fries to share with the three cats. Even ducks ate fries! Yes!! Hmmm. More cats joined us. One of them is KH. I am not exactly KH-tolerant. Hmmmm..  We went to walk around some more lor. HaHa. We brought fishballs from Hildir's stall. Yes yes. Hmmm. After which, we all decided to go play pool. Hmm. With KH around. Hmp. We took 962 to Causeway Point. Yes. Even ducks are meowing when I read my book. I was squished to meowing death by a woman who refused to move even when there's space!!! MEOW MOO MEOW!!  Okay. They played pool. Me and WQ didn't. I read my book. Yes! Even books are fantastic. Meow moo meow. They played for about 2 hours there. Brrr! I feel so cold! Ducks are meowing out of lousy music! Yes yes.  After that, we went to Mac to eat dinner. Luckily KH didn't follow us. Anyway, something terrible happened. You see ar....I got to order 3 sets of McNuggets Meal and HL ordered a regular Coke. Okay. Somehow, the counter staff didn't compute my order for another Coke. HL drank my share of Coke... I got kinda annoyed. However, I was just about to buy another one when THAT Gloria snatched away the $2 note forcefully from me and said "I go buy...gimme!". I was fuming mad and I glared after her. I HATE it when people does that to me. I CAN buy for myself de lor. It's like her saying I am very incompetent at doing these sort of things. Come on lor. I was only mildly annoyed at HL. She doesn't have to show that she's very good at solving problems. I HATE people doing that. ! I sat down and growled. HL thought I was angry at her. WQ knew otherwise. (Heh Heh) HL, nope, I am not angry at you. Word of advice: DON'T EVER DO THAT TO ME. Finally. I let my anger out. I feel so shuang. I am sick of being nice. Releashing your anger is a very good thing after all.  Okay. After that, we went home. Me, KK, Janet and Gloria walked home. We passed through blocks. Hm. I came home to find my brother eating and his friend using his computer to play games. Oh i meow! Mother has gone to work, even though today was supposed to be her off day. Hmm. Must ask what happened later. Meowing moo!     I bathed, then came online. I was majorly distracted by The Parents Trap showing on Channel 5!! My favorite movie of all times! How meowful! Even after watching a lot of times (I got the VCD), it still manage to touch me! The storyline's beautiful! Meow moo meow!!  Okay. I think I end this blog le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
