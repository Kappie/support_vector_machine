I don't know why. I had such a blast though. For once I didn't feel totally outcasted from the theatre people. Even though I was. I just had so many people that I could hug and dance with that I just felt like most fucking cool person on Earth. And I didn't care if people thought I was weird. I just wanted to have fun. And I did. People were nice to me even if they didn't really like me, and though that sounds pretty pathetic, I enjoyed it.  I've been thinking about how weird the "in" theatre people must view me as. In class I was always completely silent, except when rehearsing or performing. I just didn't have a need to socialize or even communicate with these people. Then when I'm around my friends I try to act really wild and crazy(genuinely, I really am wild and crazy inside) in an attempt to shock them or something. Maybe I just want them to know that I'm not always silent or something. In the past this behavior has never really done anything. They would still never notice me. But tonight I think they maybe did. Some people seemed a little surprised that I lived this "other life", and for whatever selfish part of me I was feeding, it made me feel good. There are people I plainly dislike, and don't care if they don't notice me. But there are some who I always wished would maybe pay a little attention to me. And they did, for better or worse. Even offering me a cookie was all I needed to get a sense of closure from it all, and I think I am now content to be on the outside of the Theatre. Goodbye Haymarket. Looking back, It wasn't as bad as I always said it was.  We went to Happy Donuts. It's a great place.  They give you free stuff. I started to notice the immense variety of people that go there too. Unlike previous hangouts where they attract very specific groups of people, this place had everyone. We had a couple of college-age Asian guys, studying something(one took a birthday picture for us). We had a few older men reading the newspaper or magazines while out getting donuts at 1 o' clock for whatever reason. And my personal favorite, we had the strange man on the computer on his laptop. The laptop was on, but he never did anything. He just left it on the desktop like a compulsive need to have a screen in front of him. It's like me and my need to have electronics buzzing for me to get to sleep at night(that's one thing people loooove).  I need to stop acting like I'm really desperate for sexual attention. I'm really not, except once in a blue moon where I do have a craving for it. i just enjoy pretending to play the part of the sexually deprived little gay rabbit who needs his happy fun hour. But honestly, I'm perfectly content as is. Well, at least in that aspect.   I'm so happy for Claudia. I think this* is exciting for all of us, because it quite possibly is the birth of a new era in our lives. The era of *gasp* actual dating. Instead of the whole comfy sleep with your friend stuff of high school, our group might finally make that scary and probably bad step into the real world. The pessimist inside me would go up to her and be like, "It won't work. You're stupid.". But that's why the pessimist inside me is hidden in a little bottle that's labeled, "Only open in emergancys that require extreme rational thinking, such as a nuclear attack".  For once I don't want to stop writing. I got into a phase where updates became tedious. Even rarer was the update that is not completely comedic. Don't expect this to be a trend, just an homage to the good old days. What am I talking about, my blog has always been about dancing monkeys and strange men hovering around Lutheran Churches.  I doubt she reads this(or knows it exists), but today is Yael's 16th birthday. Happy Birthday Yael!  I bid you all adieu. *If you don't know what I'm talking about, ask Claudia. And yes, I just wanted to use an asterix. Happy fun time!
