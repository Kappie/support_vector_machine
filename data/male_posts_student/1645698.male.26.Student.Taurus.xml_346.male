Normals will be on the floor laughing and umm.... it's kinda kewl that they managed to do this... for years now. It's based on Tribes [*and now they use Halo, happy now you bitching whore?], and the online Catpure-the-flag game. Really great, really funny... Late last night my brother IMed me this link:  urlLink The Slacktivist . This one post made me crack, So funny... So great... such a great analogy. To reply to  urlLink this ... I have nothing to say, cause if I say something then it will be perverted and on the internet... Then people will think that I am either a flaming homosexual or a pervert...or both...LOL [don't worry it's an inside joke, very inside, like the inside of my brain...other half].
