Anyways, here's what I was gonna use instead of the text in the box at the top, BUT, decided not too. Maybe I should work on a top banner REALLY hard and then start a theme from there, I was thinking of creating some crazy retro cartoons in photoshop. But we'll see how that turns out :) As for now, I'm gonna add a radio blog and a friends list linking my friends blogs, journals, xangas and such.
