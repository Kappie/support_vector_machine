Recap of the day: Math-bleh Science-the movie was boring, but I got a chance to toil an get frustrated over my math homework Random Spanish funnies of the day:  1. Only seconds after I throw a small dictionary, frisbee-style, at Derrick's head and it glances off and falls to the floor, does Mrs. Sustic walk in and catch me with 5 dictionaries in my hand. 2. For the second have of the class, I periodically moved my desk to the left so much that I ended up in the next row over. Mrs. Sustic didn't notice at all. 3. Nathaniel whacks Derrick with elongated binding from planner notebook. Repeatedly.  Arg-I still have math homework that I really don't feel like doing, and don't really understand much at all. Anyone else know trig and the laws of Sines and Cosines? Anyone?? lol  I don't know if its the season or what, but lately my mind has gotten a bit more clouded with random thoughts, images, and junk. So just a notice-if you ever see me just randomly shudder periodically, I'm trying to get rid of it all so I can think and do homework. It's similar to when you've got music constantly playing in your head, and you can't get it out no matter how hard you try-not fun at all. It's getting annoying-quite.  Continuing the recap of the day: English-We're on chapter 9 of To Kill A Mockingbird, and I'm really enjoying the book. It's one of the best books I've read in English class so far, I'd say. Social-I got a 46/47 on the current events test, all because I said Alabama instead of Louisiana. What's the difference, anyway? They're both chock-full of rednecks, so I don't see why we shouldn't just call the whole South "Redneckville". lol Jazz band was fairly good today, other than Mr. Shelton saying we had a bad second set the other night. But he was right-we weren't that great for the second half of the performance at the open house.  This has been another boring episode of Bren's Random Rambling.  Thank you for listening.
