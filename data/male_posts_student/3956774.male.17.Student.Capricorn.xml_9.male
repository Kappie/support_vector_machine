They were of no match for my cuning and guile. besides had a nice chat with bex-butch on the roof of the boat on a very sunny afternoon eve. So have you missed me? Actually dont answer that cos i know the utterings you may perchance to display will not be to my desiring. lol. Well even if you didnt misseth me i certainly missethed you, and bugger of all buggers i ran out of credit so couldnt text my kiddies. Shame. Right must dash theres a bowlful of washing up that is spelling out my name in soapy letters. Ciao mien.
