This is something towards which I have always aspired.  Then came the really big news: I was to have a close-up shot.  I am in the foreground, standing right next to the guy who's actually saying lines (who happens, purely by coincidence, to be my dad).  Then, at just the right moment, I receive a helping of mustard on my plate.  I start to walk away and then -- this was really where I had a chance to let my talents shine -- I realize I don't have enough mustard.  So I walk back in front of the camera, gesture in annoyance at my plate, and receive another dollop of mustard.  Now, I know what you're thinking: Rob, you need to have a  speaking  role in order to join the Screen Actor's Guild!  Why didn't you  say  something?  Well, actually, my not-so-savvy little friend, a speaking role alone won't give you Screen Actor's Guild eligibility: you need something more than just one or two words to get your SAG membership.  You need to say  five  words.  Once you're around long enough, you'll find that out yourself -- but I figured I'd let you in on a little secret.  I obviously need to be important.  I wish I were really hot.  I'm moderately good looking, but if I were an extremely sexual beast, I could be a movie star, and then I'd be happy for sure.  Also, I've decided to stop posting so many pictures on this website.  They (1) take too much time, and (2) really don't add much.  I just have to write more filler text -- otherwise, they jumble up on top of each other.  So from here-on out, expect less pictures!  You can always expect less from me.
