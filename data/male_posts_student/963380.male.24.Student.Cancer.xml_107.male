There were people screaming and running. I found myself in a family's house - an asian family - carrying some kind of firearm. The gun was round and flat like a puck, it filled the palm of my hand. It also had some sort strange air about it - it reminded me of a glade plug in. I suppose that might have something to do with a resevoir of green liquid in the base of it. Either that or the spring fresh scent.  I found myself in this house, where the little girl, the only child in the family, was crying and afraid. I picked her up and went to find her parents - They were terrified when I woke them up - no doubt because I was carrying this weapon. The calmed down when they realized I wasn't going to hurt them. The mother became extreme distraught and wanted to me to make sure there was nothing in the bathroom. It seems I was aware that there could be something dangerous in the bathroom as I wouldn't approach it head on. I grabbed a mirror from the vanity  - at which point I realized the house I was in was the one I lived in as a child.  I peered around the corner and examined the room throught the mirror. There was nothing.  We fled the house under a sky streaked with red and purple... the sky aflame with debris and death... I found myself running into a canyon, surrounded by people. They were all running deeper and further into the canyon, trying to escape something. A gas began to descend from the sky, the people began to run. I reached into my pack for a gas mask... Pulled it out. No one else had one. You need to get a gas mask on in under nine seconds in order for it to be effective - the process is shut your eyes, don't breathe, turn your back against the wind, pull the mask over your face and exhale sharply to get rid of any pollutants that you may have inhaled. A gas mask is only of limited protection, the only thing that will do in a chemical or biological attack is head to toe coverage in a contamination suit.  I had trouble getting the mask on. I was puffing out my breath when I woke... people dying around me.  I called it a dream. I suppose it was really a nightmare.
