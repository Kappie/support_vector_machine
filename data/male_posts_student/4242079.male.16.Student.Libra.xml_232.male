And it was a night like this, when we would finally give in and call it quits.  I was talking to Amber today, and decided that "pre-winter depression" is going around. Nobody feels content right now...most people that we know are sad at the moment. More than usual, anyway.  I fucking hate snow. It can be as god dammed cold as it wants, but I really do not like snow.
