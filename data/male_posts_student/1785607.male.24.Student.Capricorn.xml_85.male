Going to school, those 15 minutes, are a high expectations event, is an endless music party filled with emotions. How pathetic is that? So, that's life, hence the title on the blog; at the end you just try to pass by life waiting not to numb yourself and hoping someone will grab our soul and pour in it emotions. Anyway, you keep coming and going on your life as days go by, one tries to keep oneself busy, and trying to reach our goals we bump into so many life events that are just too normal to care. Boredom. Despite it we need to continue to live, to charge at it with all we have, grab the bull by the horns and never stop to look back. Relay on family, friends and happiness of yore, waiting with excitement what will come never forgetting what has been done by us and to us. But all this is part of a process, a process called life as you grow.  And as you carry on with every burden and soulless task appointed to you ( ...and if you do not find a way... No one will!...LOL! ) all of a sudden life sends you a sign everything's going to change: not one, but two guys that show some interest in you. Now, not being abrupt to new situations I'll handle this in the most elegant and decent way. They both know about each other, we are just friends for now. Now, I seem to have my fav, not saying which one right now, I'll just say I've been spending too much time with people from San Diego.  Fingers crossed, nah! Everything seems going the way it should be.
