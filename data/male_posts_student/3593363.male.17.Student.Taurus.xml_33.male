And i realize i need to figure out 'hows it goin' because when people ask me that i just say, "i Don't know" and i really dont know why. Life to me is a puzzle and im just findin piece by peace. Just tryin to keep on takin the best out of everything i do, because if i can't get what i like, i have to like what i get.
