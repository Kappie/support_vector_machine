They live in delusion - such as 'our culture is superior', 'our military will destroy you', 'we will crush Israel' and so on.  They throw rocks at the people trying to help them, riot over the slightest insult, and refuse to accept the reality of their situation.  Now they are angry because their flag 'contains the colors of Israel'.  Come on....  I think we should begin treating the Arabs with the level of responsibility and respect warranted by their own behavior.
