Oh yeah, first thing in the morning, I woke up and Scott (my brother) and Scott Belt (my brother's friend down the street) were swimming in my pool. I  hate  swimming. I don't know why, it just sucks. My parents think I'm weird because of that. My parents also say I'm lazy when I sit on my ass all day on my computer, when that's all they do every day. Ok, back to my day. When I saw them swimming I decided to go to Kevin's house to skate. That was pretty boring. We raised one end of his rail to make it really high. I left his house after I was bored to death and went home. I sat down and read my TransWorld Skateboarding magazine and after a while I ate dinner. Then I went to the school to skate with Alec. There's nothing to skate at the school, so that's another thing that sucked. Then I went home and here I am. I'm gonna play THUG later, I'm starting to get back into it.  Saturday I want to go to the skatepark. One of my friends that I haven't seen in a while is gonna be there. Damn it, I wish I owned a skatepark! That would kick more ass than anything else! I could skate it for free and invite friends, and I could make money by charging other people to use it. I'll probably just get one put in my backyard when I have my own house, if I ever have the money (not sure how much it would cost).
