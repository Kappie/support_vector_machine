It’s along story but basically the dumb idiots at the international youth hostel booking centre cannot run a web site or use or computer. (we have tried three different types of debit card [all of which they claim work on their site] and tried over the phone for ten minutes with some woman who couldn't use a computer. so eventually we found out we could pay in cash at our nearest youth hostel. Which according to our members guide was Norwich, though this turned out to have closed in 2003. So it turns out our nearest youth hostel is Sheringham and we are desperately hoping our bus passes will also work on the way back. I am gonna have to stop writing for now as the road is getting way to bumpy, I will finish later.   Well after all that it turns out the Youth hostel in Sheringham is not connected to the international booking network or something and our nearest Youth Hostel that can book for us is Cambridge, so I have used mums card to book eventually. But at least we didn’t have to pay for any of the bus journeys and managed to get on with our passes. Also before we got into Norwich we caught the paston bus by accident and so we had to get off at Baningham and walk back to the main road where mum picked us up. 
  Re yor email: Thanks for the email, its nice to hear from you and to know your still reading this. Bah whats a bit of hypothermia going to do, did you not tell them you went to Aylsham High where in siome classrooms the temperature would be over 60c and other rooms it would be 10 degrees below the outside temperature. With this alternative URL you have been using, does this mean you could accept an invite for this blog to contribute, i wasent really sure what you meant. Anyways am back home now and thoughraly board, i have to now edit mum and dads holiday video from my camera from their holiday which I wasen't alowed to go on, how demining! It was so much fun not having parents for a week, although i had more to do with looking after the house and dog and chickens and hobit and whatnot, I actualy found myself with more time on my hands because I could do it all when i felt like (at one instance i was tidying up at 0300) without nagging. Yesterday me and chris speant an hour in the pool and by the end of it we were blue and thats especially hard considering how Chris's skin colour is quite alot darker than mine. BTW how much is your insurance costing you mine has been lowerd from 800 to 600 (and now i get to use dads car)? So anyway I must get back to meaningless tasks.   Alex   P.S enjoy Gmail, I do.
