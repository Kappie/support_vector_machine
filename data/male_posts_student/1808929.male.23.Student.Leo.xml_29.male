Hell, I didn't even leave my apartment saturday, that's how bad it is. I've got 4 exams this next week, but that means I can spend spring break however I want to. This last thursday I did get to go see The Passion of Christ. Man, I still get chills when I think about some of the scenes there. I really liked the movie and I think it made it on to my top 100 list. Yes, I keep a listing. Whoa...now I have something to talk about, cool! Ok, a while back I made a listing of my top 100 movies. I rated them based on 3 independent criteria (quality, # of times seen, desire to see again). The top 20 are as follows:  1. The Last Picture Show 2. 2001: A Space Odyssey 3. The Wizard of Oz 4. Man of La Mancha 5. Terms of Endearment 6. Lost and Delirious 7. What's Eating Gilbert Grape 8. The Last Temptation of Christ 9. Contact 10. Lost in Translation 11. All Quiet on the Western Front 12. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King 13. Six Degrees of Seperation 14. Born on the Fourth of July 15. Playing by Heart 16. Ghandi 17. Good Will Hunting 18. Unforgiven 19. Dead Poets Society 20. The Big Chill   The Last Picture Show and Terms of Endearment were both written by Larry McMurtry, my favorite fiction writer. See them both and you won't be disappointed. OK, gotta study again, so see you later.    Song of the Day: "St. Teresa", Joan Osborne
