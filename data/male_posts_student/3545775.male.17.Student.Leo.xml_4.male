Having finally got sick of editing an 8-page HTML document whenever I wanted to voice my opinions, I have finally relented and got myself a nice Blogger account. Therefore, readers can expect more updates, more frequently, and better archiving than my measly web design skills can provide. In my absence, I have mainly been making photoshoppy type things at  urlLink b3ta , which is fun, albeit life-eating. You can see some of my diseased imaginings at  urlLink my MSN Group , which I have implemented because the lovely people at Freeservers won't let me remote link. Hopefully coming soon: An article about the right-wing subtext in ER, and some lovely paintings...
