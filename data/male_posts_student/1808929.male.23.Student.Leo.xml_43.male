Month after month it's the same polarizing talk of status-quo and reform that leads to little or no action. And to think that the hours upon hours of televised political discourse only matter for about 10% of the voting population that hasn't already made up its mind yet.   It's ironic to me also that while there's so much political bickering there's very little difference between Bush and Kerry on the big issues. Both of them were in favor of using force in Iraq (though Kerry would have preferred to wait it out longer). Both of them support Bush tax cuts (though Kerry would repeal the tax cuts for a very small percentage of the population). Both of them are against gay marriage ultimately, though Kerry would pursue a more hands-off approach to banning gay marriage. Bush added a perscription drug coverage element to medicare while Kerry has not really opposed it or provided any details on health care reforms.  Don't get me wrong, there are several areas where Bush and Kerry differ widely (education, affirmative action, the U.S. role in the U.N.) but these issues don't get near as much playtime as those mentioned previously. Why that is I'm not sure. So while the political pundits keep on punting their political footballs back and forth I might as well go fix myself a drink, sit back, and watch some Star Trek.
