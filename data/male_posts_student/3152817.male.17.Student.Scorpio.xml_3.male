Obviously this isn't true because Bush doesn't actually  own  any factories.  This can't be said of Sen. Kerry however.  You see, the senator is married to Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  There company, the Heinz Company, as sent quite a few jobs overseas.  50 to be exact.  32 in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific.  Do you think that if elected, Kerry will ask his wife to move her companies back to America?  Of course not!  Why would the Kerry's give up the millions of dollars they make from the cheap labor?  Don't believe me that Kerry would be such a hypocrite?  Go look at the Heinz products in your fridge.  I bet that if you have a few, at least one of them will be made somewhere outside the US.  Just one more reason not to turn America over to the liberals.
