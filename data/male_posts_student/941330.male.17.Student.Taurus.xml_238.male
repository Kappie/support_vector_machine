    
         let me introduce you  to the time where it all ended all of the bitterness, the suffering the sanctimonious lies, the saccharine affection i'm tired of it all  the artificiality, the banality the trepidation and feigned adulation the self-impressed and those obsessed with nothing more than the evanescent  the backstabbing and double-talking can't you see this road we're walking leads us back to square one back to you and me, us and nothing more it's all we want and it's all we're running away from  because you're just like the million others before you throwing salt over your shoulder hopping over the cracks too scared to walk under that ladder just once too scared to taste that apple too scared to live  i'm sick of just existing somebody, please wake me to someplace where i can breathe, please take me where i can leave you behind to walk this world, free and unshackled delivered from you and all that you put me through  shrug me off, you played me like a game but at the end of it all you will know my name you think that this poem is nothing but words time will give you everything you deserve
