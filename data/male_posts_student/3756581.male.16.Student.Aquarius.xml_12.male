Ahhh, The Left...so tolerant, so loving, so peaceful!   Think about the Seattle area -- Bainbridge Island to be exact -- and you think scenic views and liberal-minded tolerance.  At least the killer views are still there.   The bucolic island's deep reputation for civility got a gut check this week during the annual Grand Old Fourth of July celebration.  That's when Jason Gilson, a 23-year-old military veteran who served in Iraq, marched in the local event. He wore his medals with pride and carried a sign that said "Veterans for Bush."  Walking the parade route with his mom, younger siblings and politically conservative friends, Jason heard words from the crowd that felt like a thousand daggers to the heart.  "Baby killer!"  "Murderer!"  "Boooo!"  To understand why the reaction of strangers hurt so much, you must read what the young man had written in a letter from Iraq before he was disabled in an ambush:        "I really miss being in the states. Some of the American public have no idea how much freedom costs and who the people are that pay that awful price. I think sometimes people just see us as nameless and faceless and not really as humans. ... A good portion of us are actually scared that when we come home, for those of us who make it back, that there will be protesters waiting for us and that is scary."  On the Fourth, Jason faced his worst fear.  It was such a public humiliation -- home front insult after battlefield injury.   This is an example of the disgusting, disrespectful, and absolute hatred that the left has for the men and women that fight for our freedom! You don't have to agree with the war, but at least support the men and women in uniform! For all of you Leftists out there...and you know who you are...you scum bags should be ashamed of yourselves! It's one thing to voice your opinion against the War in Iraq, but it is quite another to personally attack an individual simply because he, not only fought but became injured, in a war you disagree with! Wheres the tolerance, indifference, and love that you hold so dearly?! Oh right! Thats just a cover-up for your true agenda...destroying American Freedom, and freedom around the world.   Take a look at the news artical my friends, this is the Kerry/Edwards voting base, these are the people that support them; do you really want these kind of people to decide who runs our country? This concludes my rant for the day, I'll see you soon.
