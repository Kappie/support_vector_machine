Marcus looks like heath ledger  (in my mind a bad thing)  what is it with girls  and toesocks? Are they all mad? I believe so, but then again all guys worship  Super Mario?  Also, um. Oh, let's get  the good stuff out of the way.  Marcus walked Katie to our usual bustop,  and quite frankly being a third wheel sucks ass, I shoulda walked on ahead if i  didn't need to use Kate's bus pass to get home, because mine ran out and im  broke. Well, of course they had a to have a goodby kiss, and of course they did  so blocking up the bus terminal. Kate is about 2 -3 inches shorter than me,  Marcus is 2 -3 inches taller than me, and I'm about 5'8" - 5'9". So they looked  really funny, she has to throw her head back(lookin at ceiling stylings) (I  realised two things at this point 1)Kate has a nice neck, 2) Shorter girls have  an advantage because they always have to look up slightly to make eye  contact, when you look up the flesh around your neck tightens  highlighting the jaw line, which looks hot.) From my angle the whole thing  looked akward, I thought it was because one of them didn't know when to stop, so  you get this feeling like "are we stopping now? no? ok..." But i asked Kate  about whether she felt that way, probably not a question to ask. She didn't, so  i'll just assume one or the other needs more practise. Pfft. Stupid teen love.  Waste of Time.  Picnic Island was fun! Yar! I got to have a drink I'm aclling the Day at the beach, Tomato sauce, Coke, Sherbet  Salt, Lots of Salt. I  forgot something. Oh, I've got an online Physical Science quiz. Meaning i can  sit with the notes in front of me, what the hell? But if they want to give me 5%  free, then cool. Wish my Java Assignment was like that.  For some reason I'm getting  the vibe that girls assume something with us fellas. Sex induendo for one. But  its late and I dont feel like ranting, so ill elaborate some other time. Oh! I've decided to call  people Pooky or Sabo. just for the hell of it. You know, like how you say, mate,  pal, yar, etc. And I'm going to go to a lecture in my Pj's because I can.  Sex Me.
