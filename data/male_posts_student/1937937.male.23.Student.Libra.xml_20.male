On our way to the Blockbuster in South Miami, we somehow found ourselves in Coconut Grove.  Now this, right off, did not bode well for a timely movie return: Coconut Grove can be a very dangerous place when it comes to aimless youths in cars (which is exactly what the two of us were).  We found a parking place, left the car behind, and headed out into the street.  The first mystery of the day was the mystery of the drum people.  Who were they?  Why were they unloading several dozen drums from their car?  I didn't stop to ask: the scene seemed a little too dangerous.  So we continued on our way.   The next thing we came to was the Graffiti Building.  Now this, in itself, is not so remarkable: a lot of buildings have Graffiti on them.  But this building was actually  painted  with Graffiti, and I thought the only place they did that was on the New York Subway.  Well, I don't know what the deal was, or what kind of strange deals went down in this building, but I thought it would be a good idea to take a picture, and immortalize the building on my website, where it will be seen by thousands upon thousands of curious web-tourists.   Ask yourself this: what is the man in the picture doing?  Is he smoking a cigarette?  Or is it something else?  And why are there musical notes coming out of the smoke?  Is the building a music factory?  Or perhaps it's a Graffiti store, and they're advertising their colors... or maybe it was just a random, drive by, very complex graffiting.  We may never know, because the building was quite foreboding and looked deserted.  For God's sake, are those  sperm ?  Who would go through all that trouble to paint a building with graffiti, and then desert it?  I might do something like that.  I'd probably get bored with my building and want a new one.  That's what happened to my room -- well, actually, I wasn't bored of it, but I did desert it after painting it many different colors.  There were no curious smoking men in my room, however (except for me -- I occasionally smoked in the bedroom, I admit it).  So that's it for the day's mysteries... Extraordinary.
