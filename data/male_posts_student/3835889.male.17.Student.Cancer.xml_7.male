Lolxz can you imagine that? LuckilyI was not caught because the patrol car was busie on other things...AnywayI can't wait for the nxt lesson, which is on my birthday, 21st July...And some more it is a double lesson! And the nxt day 22nd July, I will be able to get my graduated license, whereby I can drive alone on the road! Wow...Can't wait man...      Anyway whenI got back home,I was slightly tired. But my dad wanted me to drive my whole familyto a post office which is a few miles away...Boy wasI exhausted whenI got home. I sure is looking forward to another driving lesson, and my new car...Toyota Camry LE...Sure I do...As I never had the chance to own a car back in Spore...Anyway its getting late and I'm quite tired, so I'm gonna rest now...*Yawnz*   (-_-)
