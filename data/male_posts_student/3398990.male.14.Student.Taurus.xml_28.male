So now i have come home and i am sortta in a pissy mood...  When i come home i wanna just relax and it annoys me coz theres my mums b/f and hes all like oh the cats are hungrey, and my mum is like, feed them then, and then he goes oh david will do it and then he speaks to the cats goin... "go ask david to feed u, go on... go on"! And im like, what the f**k ya doin that is just insanly stupid! And it gets right on my tiny ittle man tits! and i just wish... just for once that he would treat me like an adult. U c my bros. are like much older them me and he hardly ever talks to them and when he does he talks to them wid respect, and then he'll speak to me and he like makes stupid noises like im a baby and pretend to fart and stuff and god IT GETS ME SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!! god im pissed off. But other then that im fine! lol ;p bye!
