AND, there's a PW meeting too! Damn! That means, no going home before 2. Agh!  I don't know if I'm alright. I really don't. I've been brushing whatever I'm feeling aside cause of the speed of school life. I'm also soooo grateful for two more people... Melissa and Sueann. Thanks you two, for checking up on me and praying for me respectively. Thanks heaps. I really need prayer! Heh.  I don't wanna brood about things anymore... I'll just end up all depressed and all, so yeah... I'm only brushing it aside again, but it'll come back. Sigh.  Me Kayaking course is this Sunday. And I've got a Photography Club outing on Saturday... I don't think I'll be in church this week. Maybe its better also... To take a break from all that church.  And to Rhordan, Angie, MJ and Jo...  Welcome back!!!   Sherman
