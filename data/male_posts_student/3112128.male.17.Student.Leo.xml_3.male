There are people in schools, churches and public places in general, being struck down by what now seems to be 'common' deluded tendencies and actions. Just this day I witnessed no less than 5 deluded people in a common place of schooling! I'll post more about this on the weekend, but for now; a warning: Stay sane and think logically!
