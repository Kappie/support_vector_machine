Lifting 5 days a week in the off season  Constantly talking to my dad and friends about it  Researching cleats  Etc..  Sometimes you just need to suck it up  Say fuck it to all the extra baggage that comes with it  And actually do something  And I know no one will understand this  But this whole overdoing it  Ends up fucking everything up  Because it just isn't fun anymore when you do something all the time  Whatever  I hate my job
