But I am pleased to announce the up-and-coming Flaming Chicken Studios, a project that my friend and I have been working on for quite some time.  Details of this project are sketchy right now, but we expect to have a webcomic, a few Flash videos, and a bunch of other goodies.  Until then, goodbye.   Random Quote:  "I pose a conundrum to ya.  A riddle, if you will.  What's the difference between you and a mallard with a cold?  One's a sick duck... I can't remember how it ends, but your mother's a whore." -Sean Connery (Actually, Darrell Hammond playing Sean Connery, but the effect is the same.)
