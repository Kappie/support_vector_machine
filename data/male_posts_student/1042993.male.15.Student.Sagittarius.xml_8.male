I am trying to update my blog more than I did in the old one, but as you know, I have an extremely boring life, and have little to talk about ;-)  Anyway, I am working on a project that will remain quiet until I am finished (sometime during the middle of this summer -- probably late June or July).  For a little hint,  urlLink here  is a link for the place it will be located.  "Philosophy" -- that's right.... you saw it.... "Philosophy"......  Stay tuned!
