Hopefully I can do something tonight to render my day anything other than pointless!  But today I've done a bunch of sitting around.  Fun.  Actually my Counter-Strike WON ID is not coming through so I can't play.  That would be the major reason why I'm blogging.  I really don't have much to say.  Right... so I applied at 3 more places.  Actually 2 but the third only hires people over 18.  l33t.  Apparently the YMCA and Target don't need any help... no luck there.  I'm running out of time here... I don't think I'm going to be getting a job this summer.  In other news, my instant messenger has been on for almost 5 days.  That's a long time... right.  Brett says it won't do 10 days.  I plan to prove him wrong.  Hopefully it won't bomb out.  What am I doing... nothing really.  Looking at the Team 3D website and listening to Jurassic 5.  I am listening to: " Concrete Schoolyard " by  Jurassic 5
