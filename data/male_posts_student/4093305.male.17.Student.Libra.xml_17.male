In 15 counties in Florida, they will be using touch-screen voting machines that don't make printouts or paper trail of any kind, and are  urlLink easily hacked , and there are all kinds of  urlLink shady politics  and shemes involved.    Plus, software instability alone is enough to reconsider the use of the machines without paper to keep track of votes. In 2002, South Carolina  urlLink lost 436 votes  to two machines in an election because of software trouble. When 537 votes in Florida determined the outcome between Bush and Gore, a mistake like that would be detrimental. Seriously, what the fuck?
