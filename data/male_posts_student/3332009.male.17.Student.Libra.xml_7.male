The alarm not only woke me up but the entire neighbourhood. I had no choice but to wake up. I did my daily routine and i ponder what to do for the rest of the day. I decided to clear my cupboard. While cleaning my cupboard, I saw my passport and decided to look at it. To my shockness, my passport had expired three months ago. I totally forgot to renew my passport. I will be going to Malaysia next week. I thank my lucky stars and my curiosity to clean my cupboard that i found out this. What if i did not realise that my passport had expired? Why must Singapore boys waiting to serve NS need to renew their passport every 6months? Total waste of time. I think the govt very scared and they have no fate in us not serving our NS and running away from Singapore.Talking about NS, i need to start preparing myself although it is two years away. I went jogging in the evening to practice 2.4km.   In the whole, nothing interesting happen except for that almost dreadful mistake.
