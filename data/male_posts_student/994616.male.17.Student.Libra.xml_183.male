He had his hands up in the air and was shaking his head. It was amazingly cute  Pink T-Shirt Guy He gets an extra 5 points because he's queer (or so unbelievable masculine that he has gone in a circle).He was short and had dark hair - my two main requirements.   Pool Playing Guy I'm a sucker for guys with curly hair that gel it out. I think it stems from John Hobbey and John Baret (I hope that's not a trend) And this guy had it, I think he was checking me out to, and as you can tell from the fact that i have a blog, anything that plays to my vanity gets points.  I would have a better time if my stomach had behaved it's self. There's only one reason I'm still writing: Distract myself from the fact that john's having sex in the other room, and she's faking.  Unless y'know she can orgasm really quickly and... fake like.
