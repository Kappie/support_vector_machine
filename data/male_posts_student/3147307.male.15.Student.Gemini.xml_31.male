And we have practices year round. I would have been like the last man off the bench, and I didn't want to get up at 4:30 every morning in the summer to do that. The only thing I wish could have happened in my basketball career was to have a winning season. I have played on a losing team since 6th grade (Bulldogs, Wildcats, and Perry combined record: 23 wins, 71 losses) I'll never not enjoy basketball, but I can't waste my time on something like this.
