Corrine Brown was censured by the House after calling the 2000 election a "coup d e'tat," and her remarks were stricken from the roll.   That's censorship. I'm a Robert's Rules guy, and that's still censorship. Were she yelling from her seat, it's one thing, but she had the floor. Things she said before she was out of order were stricken...censorship.  The only news that covered it was NBC, and they called it an "outburst," neglecting to mention any of what Brown said, or the UN issue. I guess when we've got West Nile and terror, we forget about stolen elections and the hypocrisy that our country runs at. Good work, news!  Want to listen to it?  urlLink try here .
