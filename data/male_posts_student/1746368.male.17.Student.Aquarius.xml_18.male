I'm making dinner right now, so I won't be long, but I will type more afterwards. I am really starving. The pizza is smelling good right now, I can smell it from the kitchen to my room (I'm in the back of my house, for those of you who haven't actually been to my house, which would be a lot who are reading this). Right now I can't really think of much more to say. I ate now. I never remembered to finish this. I'll leave off with this quote. It is from a Calvin and Hobbes book. We could all use a little more of Calvin's humor, we need humor as much as possible. I'll leave off with this quote. It is from a Calvin and Hobbes book.
