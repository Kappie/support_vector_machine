In 27 days I will be 17 years old, with two years of high school to go. Shit. How time flies. I remember when I entered middle school, and how I was scared at the fact that I would have to go to 6 classes and have 6 DIFFERENT teachers. I'm glad I got over it though!  My life, as you can tell by my new layout, has turned dark and sinister. Why? I cannot tell, because I don't know. And Meghan, don't try cheering me up. This is just my overall feeling, and I like the picture. Sad, but in a way, happy. Know what I mean? Probably not, most people don't get what I am saying, but oh well. Life sucks and then you die, or at least that is what Nicole says. I dunno if this is true. Sure my life sucks now, but it could be worse. I'm the leader of a group of teenagers helping build a house with Habitat for Humanity called the Teensters. If you don't know, Habitat for Humanity builds homes for low income families. Wanna know something sad? Teachers qualify to live in a Habitat house. How goddamn sad is that? Someone who I learn from makes less than $50,000. Damn. What has this world come too?  School starts in 7 days. Scary to think that I will be starting my 3rd year at Rancho. I wonder how this year will be different. How I will change Rancho in my own special way. How I will pass Mr. Hale's Ground School. How I will grow the balls to talk to Josef about how I feel. How this year's football team is gonna be different from last years. How Stefani and I will continue to be friends. But I can't dwell on things forever. I'm reading a book, entitled " The Art of Happiness, a Handbook for Living ." It is by the Dali Lama. I was just gonna read it and tell my mom, yea I read it, to make her happy, but as I continued reading, I realized that it was good. Shocking! I read! lol.   Anywayz.......I have been having dreams lately. About Josef. What do they mean? I'm desperate. lol. But yea. Seriously, could Josef be gay? And if he is gay, how do I know if he likes me? Do I just go up and ask him? These are the questions that I don't have the answers for.  I was talking with Meghan tonight, and I said...If I had the magical power to turn one person gay, and make him call in love with me for the rest of my life and we live happily ever after, it would have to be   JOSEF  . If you had this power, to turn someone you liked in love with you, who would you pick?  God I'm hungry for a smoothie from Smoothie King. Damnit Dez, you got me addicted to Smoothie King! lol. If you want a GREAT smoothie, go to the Smoothie King at the corner of Lake Mead and Rampart and look for the short girl whose name is Dez. She is great. She is dating Jamison. He is the one in the friends section with the big pink sign, 'Over here big boy.' He wants me to take it off. I will.....when I get a new one. Dez, Jamison, Jamie, and myself went bowling and minigolfing, so I will upload pictures when Jamie gets off her ASS AND SENDS THEM TO ME!  It is hard to believe, but I graduate high school in 2 years. I will be out on my own in 2 years! Holy crap! =-0 What am I gonna do? Where am I gonna go to college? What do I wanna major in? Do I wanna get my bachelors or masters? Ugh. Decisions, decisions. Oh well. It is 12:30 and this is by far my longest post, so I'm gonna go. Later y'all.  **UPDATED 10:51 AM** It has come to my attention that Smoothie King has some "issues." I won't post them here, because it could get some people into trouble. Needless to say, the smoothies are good, whether or not you agree with the business practice.
