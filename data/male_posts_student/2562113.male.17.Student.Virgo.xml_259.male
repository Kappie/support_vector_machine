It made me realise though that im going to be on the low end of the totem pole starting july 9th, and that isnt going to end until the folling july. iTs going to be my first year of college, and im probably not going to have any great party stories to tell, no "walk of shames" to brag about, and defintly no club 21 where i can chill with friends and do smutty shit. All my friends are going to be all the way in upstate new york (or at least most of them) having the time of their lives, the girl im obsessed with is going to FUCKING ARIZONA, and im going to a place where the only thing you do for four years is work. ITS MAKING ME SOO angry and CONFUSED... should i go to this place and forget about all my friends and make work and future my only concern, or should i go with those that never left me hangin before. I fucking hate this shit man. With less than 2 months left its making me reflect more and more on all the shit i should have done years ago but am only starting to do or understand now, like playing lacrosse last year, being more social and giong out in 9th 10th and 11th, being more rebellious, i should have stayed home last summer, etc etc. people say that they are going to be visting everyone, but i cant do any of that shit. people say that they are going to stay connected with everyone, but looking at my parents, they are only freindly with about 10 people from their high school. I cant just walk away like they did. The day july 9th comes is goign to be one of the saddest days of my life, the day i leave rockland county, my family, my friends, the house i grew up in, and all the memories i had here are going to be just that, memories  maybe im just depressed cause i look at my sister and see how much she is like my parents, how unlike her i actually had friends that went out of their way to show me good times, and now all she obsesses over is work work work at the age of 21  next time i post ill read this and reflect on it, maybe answer some of my own questions, and If anyone has any negative comments about this post, go fuck yourselves darin
