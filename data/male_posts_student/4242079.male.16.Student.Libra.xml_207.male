Thus, not selling anything. Yesterday I sold one hundred dollars worth of stuff. My average is about twelve hundred. I write about work a lot.   I simply cannot drink anymore. Sunday night, I tried drinking Rye. Did not work so well for me. Last night, one beer. Also, did not work so well with me. I write about drinking a lot.  I feel the urge to be educated. I need to learn something. Something useful, which will allow me to make money. Even if it is on the side.  Three posts this morning, and it is only 11:23 am. It is time for me to get off of the computer.
