So for a couple days we've been joking (only partially, though) that I need to grow a left nut.  Fast forward to tonight.  My roommates and I generally have some random friends over on Wednesday nights for what we call "Card Night".  In case you're way too simple-minded, card night is where we get together and (wait for it...) play cards and just get together and have a good time.  Well, one of my roommates decides to do some drinking tonight, and since I haven't done so in a while, I figured what the heck.  Fast forward.  So around 10:00 (10:11pm to be exact) I decide to do my first ever drunk dial (not really drunk, but feeling good [two shots of   Montezuma Tequila, and a Doc Otis later]).  The person I decide to call was a certain someone that I'm interested in (No, it's not Patrick's mom)...  Besides she had asked me to call her later if I got the chance, and as soon as her voice-mail picked up, I realized what time it was [note: she goes to bed fairly early, and turns her phone off when she goes to bed].  I was leaving a message and held the phone up to have everyone say, "HI [insert name here]" and my friend Rose said, "go out with Scott!".  I ended the phone message and we all had a pretty big laugh, I was pretty impressed that she did it, and wasn't upset at all that she did.  Thus, that is how Rose became my left nut.  Fast forward.  Talking with Rose a little bit later, she gave me a couple of tips about if or when she brings it up or asks about it.  So that was good... but she basically said, "don't read into anything too much, and still you need to just ask her out"  Fast forward.  Now that everyone has gone and I've had a bit of quiet time to myself... I'm a little nervous.  This big giant boulder that's just been sitting here and getting bigger has been getting increasingly more difficult to get moving... but I think that Rose put some TNT under it, and now it's got a little bit of momentum and all I need to do is give it that shove and see where it goes from there.  It basically is really making me step up to the plate and get ready to throw myself in front of the bullet (too many analogies?).  Well, one thing is, I'll know one way or the other, and if it's bad news, then I can get to feeling sorry for myself and get that part over.  If it's the way I'd like it to go, then I can finally get on with enjoying my time with her even more.  Any advice?  Comments?  Snide remarks?  I'm really nervous.
