Lets watch Theodore hop around his day.  PRINCESS:Oh Prince Charles, I love you so. PRINCE:Your face is as breathtaking as lightning, but nothing like as dangerous. PRINCESS:I can see your soul through your wet and slimy eyeball!  FROG:Excuse me, does either of you have a buck?  PRINCE:No, sorry, try the moneylender. PRINCESS:No, she'll never give out money to YOU.  FROG:Well I thank you, and I will try and see.  MONEYLENDER:And that is why you must soak in a warm bath for 7 hours every day! MAN:Oh, I see MONEYLENDER:If you want, I can soak with you. MAN:Hmm, that wouldn't be so bad. But are you sure that would be a good idea?  FROG:Excuse me, I would like a buck.  MONEYLENDER:You must soak in a bath for 3 hours every day. MAN:Why is it only 3 for him? MONEYLENDER:He's smaller. MAN:Makes sense.  FROG:I'll just...find someone else.  FROG:Excuse me sir, do you have a buck?  ERIC:Ego wa hanashimasen. Anata wa kaeru desu ka? Hai, sou desu. Anata no kokoro wa oishii desu ne.  FROG:Umm...never mind.  JEWISH PRINCESS:I'm a Jewish Princess!  FROG:Will you lend me a buck?  JEWISH PRINCESS:If you give it back when you're done. Tehehe  FROG:Oh, how witty. kiss me.  JEWISH PRINCESS:Oh, ok.  FROG:Blech! *Holds up fake mouth*  JEWISH PRINCESS: SMOOCH!  FROG: Oh! I turned into a man in a frog suit! I best be hopping away now!  GIRL IN FROG SUIT: Oh! What a beautiful creature! I love you!  FROG: Hmm, must be my day. Ya got a buck?  GIRL IN FROG SUIT: That's all you're charging? Alright, let's go!  *They go off stage to do their thing*  ERIC:Abunai!    Dude! Best play evah! I moved the title from the first line to the title field, as makes sense.
