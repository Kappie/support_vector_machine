You fall in love  Zing boom  The sky up above  Zing boom  Is caving in  Wow bam  You've never been so nuts about a guy  You wanna laugh you wanna cry  You cross your heart and hope to die   'til it's over and then  It's nice and quiet  But soon again  Starts another big riot   You blow a fuse  Zing boom  The devil cuts loose  Zing boom  So what's the use  Wow bam  Of falling in love   It's. oh. so quiet  It's. oh. so still  You're all alone  And so peaceful until...   You ring the bell  Bim bam  You shout and you yell  Hi ho ho  You broke the spell  Gee. this is swell you almost have a fit  This guy is "gorge" and i got hit  There's no mistake this is it   'til it's over and then  It's nice and quiet  But soon again  Starts another big riot   You blow a fuse  Zing boom  The devil cuts loose  Zing boom  So what's the use  Wow bam  Of falling in love   The sky caves in  The devil cuts loose  You blow blow blow blow blow your fuse  When you've fallen in love   Ssshhhhhh...   It's Oh So Quiet. Lisa Ekdahal.
