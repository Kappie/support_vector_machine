But he could've taken one more for the team! It'd be his name in the record books, after all!  If it weren't for all the trade rumors swirling around, the Twins would have to be the hottest team in baseball right now. I mean, it feels like the last time they lost a series was in May. They're just playing excellent, excellent baseball right now. Hopefully, they can keep it up, because even if we sweep the White Sox tomorrow, then we face a tough Red Sox team, and the lead we have over Chicago could go just as fast as it came. But hey, if Oakland could win 20 games in a row a few years back, what's stopping the Twins from doing the same? I'm all for it, personally.
