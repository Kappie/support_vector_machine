There were a few things that were not right about that game tho...: the team we were facing subbed in 3 good players from other teams; Dever does not know how to count; the winning shot was made on a travel. Other than that, it was like our other games, except with better passing than usual: Javiar gets the tip-offs, pass to hanson, score; or try to score.    I have no problem with hanson being a ball hog; he makes good shots. But when he's swarmed 3 to 1... it really couldn't kill to pass it to an open Kevin or Javiar... not to mention he went against our strategy of slowing things down when we're ahead... eh... oh well. All in all, i'd say we deserved that OT win... in fact... if it wasn't for those above points, we'd won it w/o going into OT, like we did last time (we played during regular season, and beat them by one)   Anyhow, there are two more games of 3-ball (Conor's team vs Fadi's team, and the All-star game), then onto other intramurals, presumbably 4 v 4 volleyball. Dunno if i should join... maybe if people want me to...    Eh... i will be dropping casual remarks about this in my article on 3-ball.. lol, it'll be something to toss my frustration against. I wouldn't be so frustrated if the team we were facing wasn't (a) unable to win without outside help, (b) trash-talking, cocky 10ers.    Besides that, life's been fairly good... thx to keane, renae and von for coming out to watch ^^ it's greatly appreciated... u really didn't need to sacrifice a practise for that... thx again   ~Chronos
