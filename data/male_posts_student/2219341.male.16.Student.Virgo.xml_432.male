So we just go and play some piano.  well i play piano.  ha!  Davida walked out for a minute and i started play  100 Years  on the piano and she comes runnin back cuz she thought i was Mrs Rimes playin the piano!  hahaha!  talk about a compliment!  well then i got Mrs Rimes to play  Beyond The Sea  from Finding Nemo.  she said i could probably sing it as a solo for our next concert.  but i sang it... the first time i sang it i guess i wasnt too loud cuz she asked me to sing it again with more force... so i did.  she said it sounded really good.  so yase.. i'm excited bout singin that song.  i love it.  one of my new favorites.  anyways.  cant wait for church tonight.  i absolutely love church.  sigh.  God  piano.  what i love in life.  the 2 most consistent things i know of.  they never fail.  well piano's might sometimes.  but still... they never fail to make me happy so that works.  i think i shall go play some piano now.
