Naturally, the guy began to worry. "Is this your husband?" he inquired nervously. "No, honey," she replied, snuggling up to him. "Your boyfriend then?" he asked. "No, not at all handsome," she said, nibbling away at his ear. "Is it your dad or your brother?" he asked again, hoping to be reassured. "No, no, no!!!" she said. "Well, who is he then?" demanded the bewildered guy. Calmly, the girl replied, "That's me before the surgery."
