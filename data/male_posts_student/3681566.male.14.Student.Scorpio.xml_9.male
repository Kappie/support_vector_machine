It took me a total of 4 hours to do the WHOLE thing! Half of that time was looking for a host. I got a new bike too! A good one! It looks awesome, and rides good too. Me and my rents went over to Sport Mart last night. I really like that place. I bought all my back-to-school clothes there. Plus, they know us now. I really liked this pair of pants, exept they where $69.99. I asked him if he was serious, and he said maybe he can lower the price $20 under there "clearance policy". So he did. I probably have spent $500 dollars there now. Everybody, if you live near a Sport Mart, or Sport Check, GO THERE NOW!!!  5 days until I leave for Florida. Better bring my raincoat! Mike
